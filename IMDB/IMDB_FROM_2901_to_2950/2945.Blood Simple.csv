0,MartinHafer,interesting but too convoluted a plot,6,7 January 2006,"Stylistically speaking, this was a good movie--with a nice somber mood, excellent acting (except for M. Emmett Walsh--who just seemed too over the top). However, there were just too many plot devices that just didn't make a lot of sense--in other words, plot twists that were interesting but were too unrealistic to make the movie more engaging. Some examples: 1. Dan Hedaya is shot in the chest and he appears dead. He's been bleeding out for what appears to be at least a couple hours. He is found by the male lead and is dragged off to a rural spot to be buried. However, just before he is buried, he starts crawling away with amazing speed and power for a man who appears to have lost at least a gallon of blood AND who has been untreated for quite some time.2. Walsh kills Hedaya. Fine--this double-cross makes sense. But, to then try to kill the wife and her lover doesn't make that much sense--especially when this scruffy guy suddenly shows that he is an excellent marksman! Then, after snuffing the lover, the ending is exciting but way too unbelievable for words.SO, my review is an anomaly. Most reviewers liked it a lot. I just thought it was okay and the Coens have done much better films--such as their comedies. And, for a drama, I think Miller's Crossing is a MUCH better film.",Blood Simple
1,SnoopyStyle,terrific crime noir,8,24 February 2015,"Abby (Frances McDormand) is cheating on her husband Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) with his bartender Ray (John Getz) from his Texas bar. Private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) gives Marty photographic proof. Ray quits his job at the bar and looking for his pay. Marty hires Loren to kill the cheating couple. Loren breaks in and steals Abby's gun. He doctors photos to cheat Marty of the bounty and then kills him with Abby's gun leaving it behind to frame Abby. Ray comes to the bar to get his pay. Instead he finds Marty and Abby's gun. He assumes that Abby had killed Marty and tries to clean it up. It turns out that Marty isn't actually dead but he buries him alive anyways. Loren realizes that he left his lighter as well as one of the doctored photos in Marty's office. Then it becomes a series of miscommunication between Abby and Ray.The Coen brothers have created a twisty terrific crime drama. Every character has an imperfect slice of story. That is the compelling part of the movie. I do have some questions like why did Loren kill Marty? Maybe if Marty held back on the money, then he would have a reason. Or if he was robbing Marty. The motives of these people are such a twisty thing that I'm not sure they all make sense. There may be some back story and old grudges that are unsaid. Nevertheless this is an amazing debut for the brothers. It has little touches that elevates this beyond a simple crime thriller.",Blood Simple
2,Hitchcoc,Love Those Coens!,9,29 May 2010,"The starkness and intensity of this film drew me to it right away I'm not much for gratuitous violence, but I never felt it to be gratuitous. Murder is a pretty harsh business and the double cross that takes place sets a whole bunch of stuff in motion. It was fun to see the young Frances McDormand playing a character pursued rather than pursuing. The relentless attacks and confusion, with a masterful plot make this an obvious clue that these guys had a lot going for them from the outset. The final fifteen minutes or so, is as intense and gut wrenching as any I've ever seen. There's a point in many movies where a character decides, ""I can't take this crap any more"" and they get down to business. This film will make you uncomfortable, but it will also satisfy and answer the questions posed along the way.",Blood Simple
3,Horst_In_Translation,Coens on karma,8,30 September 2017,"""Blood Simple"" is an American 100-minute film from 1984 and this one is mostly known today for being the first full feature film made by the Coen Bros that started their path to greatness in the upcoming decades. The only relevant female character is played by Frances McDormand (no denying she was really stunning in here) and this was the year when she married Joel Coen and actually this was also her first acting role. Today she is an Oscar winner and way more known than her male colleagues in this over 30-year-old film. But they are good too and it really is a strong ensemble performance that did not get half the awards attention it should have. And while the Coens are also masters of subtlety, this film here is at its best during the loud and spectacular sequences like when early on the investigator shoots his client or the scene when one character suddenly comes back to life again or of course the spectacular finale with one of the most memorable knife scenes in film history. The Coens are also truly great when it comes to including crucial coincidence in their films and even when they were at or even under the age of 30, they were also very skilled with regard to that already. And in addition to that, there is also a great deal of karma in here. The only truly innocent character from the four at the center of it all is eventually also the only one who survives.There were minor issues I had with the film, but all of them came from my subjective perspective like when McDormand's character suspects her lover to kill her slightly too soon. But none of these were bad or anything, just not as great as most of the other stuff. And once again, this is a film that delivers the usual Coen situational comedy approach like the toilet sign about washing your hands, the jumping dog, the light on/off near the end and many other really interesting moments. As always with Joel and Ethan, you will discover a great deal of new things on rewatch, things you may have missed out on during the first viewing because the love to detail is as good as it gets and even if it is not surprising if you have seen other Coen films, you still should not take it for granted. This film is really as good as it gets for launching your career and many other great filmmakers can only wish for their first work to be on such a high level of quality like ""Blood Simple"". This is very much on par with the brothers' very best, maybe right now my number two from the duo, second to none except their Best Picture winner. I highly recommend checking out these genuinely entertaining 100 minutes Blood Simple has to offer. Not a film for simple people though as it will clearly transcend their horizon.",Blood Simple
4,kosmasp,Not that simple,8,11 November 2020,"The movie is not simple by a long shot. It may have a simple outline (revenge theme), but that gets turned and twisted so much you may be dizzy by the end of the movie. Which I would call a good thing. I did watch the Directors cut, which apparently is about 10 minutes shorter than the theatrical cut. A young Frances McDormand in if I'm not mistaken her first role ever. And she is as mesmerizing as you came to know her.Add to that a wide variety of great other actors and you get quite the gravitas to a story that is really wild. The Fargo humor may be missing (I don't miss it particularly, just saying), but it would not help the movie if it were included. So the movie keeps you guessing and has an ending that is telling ... or is it? Rewatching this is not a chore, but rather a delight",Blood Simple
5,classicsoncall,"""All employees must wash hands before resuming work.""",7,1 January 2008,"According to the Coen Brothers, the film's title describes a person's state of mind after he has committed murder. Fair enough, and for their very first professional directorial effort, the Coen's put out a nicely packaged product that sometimes thrills, but ultimately winds up with too many elements that defy credibility working against the story. I'm thinking about the number of gun shots fired throughout the picture that didn't attract attention, the incredible good fortune that no one was ever around as Ray (John Getz) tried to cover up Marty's (Dan Hedaya) almost murder, and Abby's (Frances McDormand) sudden burst of bravery in doing the old Luca Brasi trick on the private detective character (M. Emmet Walsh). Carrying things one step further, wouldn't someone eventually have tried to find out why tire tracks led into the middle of a fallow farm field ending in a hand dug grave?I guess all these things can be shrugged off by considering that for a first effort, the whole thing is wrapped up in a darkly entertaining noir style story with a twist involving the doctored photos of Ray and Abby dead. Oddly, the queasiest parts of the story didn't bother me all that much, like Ray trying to clean up all the blood in Marty's office. Marty's burial scene was pretty clever with the shifting mud, nice touch, but you know what the most shocking part of the flick was for me? It was the newspaper hitting the window right after Ray tells Abby that Marty was still alive when he buried him. That was about the best mis-direction I've ever encountered in a movie because you don't see it coming, and never expect it like you do in contemporary horror films.I had read a lot about this film that encouraged me to see it, and now that I've done so, my best take away is that this was a decent but not entirely successful effort by the Coen's. But you have to start somewhere, and for that somewhere, this is probably more accomplished than most first time tries by other writers and film makers. From that perspective, it's a worthwhile viewing that helps one appreciate all the more what came after in the Coen's filmography.",Blood Simple
6,gavin6942,Triumphant Beginning for the Coen Brothers,7,17 April 2015,"A rich but jealous man hires a private investigator to kill his cheating wife and her new man. But, when blood is involved, nothing is simple.I love that early on, the Coen Brothers and Sam Raimi had some overlap. Apparently, Raimi helped encourage the creation of this film. In retrospect, that is pretty interesting given that Raimi himself had not really established himself as the powerhouse he is today. And between the two (or three) of them, who is the biggest today? Probably the Coens.The goal to make a modern American film noir is quite successful, with plenty of seedy characters and a nice plot with lots of suspense/ Was this the debut for Frances McDormand? May be, and it shows how she was a strong female lead right out of the gate.",Blood Simple
7,lee_eisenberg,"actually, it's not all that simple",5,8 May 2006,"The world was introduced to Joel and Ethan Coen when the two brothers released the confusing ""Blood Simple."" The convoluted plot involves...something. A man hires a detective to kill his cheating wife and her lover, but nothing is what it seems. I think that that's the plot. I'd say that this is really a movie for the Coen brothers' hard-core fans; others won't have a clue what the hell's going on.Obviously, after this, the Coens got more ""mainstream"" (""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", ""The Ladykillers""), and a previous reviewer even complained about that. Well, unless you're truly willing to spend 99 minutes trying to pinpoint what exactly John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya and M. Emmet Walsh are doing, you'll want to avoid this. OK, but not for the fainthearted.",Blood Simple
8,Woodyanders,The Coen brothers begin their cinematic career with a bang,9,5 December 2017,"Scuzzy cuckolded bar owner Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya in peak oily form) hires sleazy private detective Visser (marvelously played to the deliciously odious hilt by M. Emmet Walsh) to murder his unfaithful wife Abby (an excellent portrayal by Frances McDormand) and her earnest lover Ray (a solid performance by John Getz). However, human error enters into the equation and things spiral dangerously out of control.Joel and Ethan Coen bring a standard noir situation kicking and screaming into a bright, lurid, and sweaty Texas world in their striking cinematic debut: We've got a dark brooding atmosphere, a colorful array of nicely sordid characters, an absorbing premise that's firmly grounded in a plausibly seamy and starkly amoral workaday reality, inspired touches of wickedly funny black humor, fine use of the dusty'n'desolate Lone Star State terrain, and a serpentine narrative in which a series of bad calls and misunderstandings culminate in a real doozy of a violent and nightmarish climax. The four leads all do sturdy work, with Walsh a particular stand-out as a super slimy worm who's more than willing to kill someone for the right price. Barry Sonnenfeld's gleaming cinematography provides an appropriately garish glittery neon look and boasts lots of sinuous tracking shots. Carter Burwell's spare moody score does the harmonic trick. Essential viewing.",Blood Simple
9,ccthemovieman-1,Memorable Modern Noir,9,8 November 2005,"This was the Coen Brothers first movie and I think it might rank second-best to more-famous ""Fargo.""This is suspenseful neo-noir (modern-day film noir) filled with fun direction by the Coens: low camera angles, closeups, concentration of sounds such as the whirring of an overhead fan, some dramatic pauses, strange characters and even stranger events taking place. The only thing missing I'd like to have is 5.1 surround sound.Warning: some bloody scenes in here are downright gross, but they sure produce some memorable scenes. Character-wise, Dan Hedeya proves to be the toughest man to kill I've ever seen in a movie! Frances McDormand is young and looks pretty, the best I've ever seen her look. John Getz's character is strange and sometimes to frustrating to watch and Emmet Walsh is outstanding at playing the sleazy private detective. Those four, along with Samm-Art Williams, comprise almost all the speaking parts in this film.This is an involving movie. Once started, you're hooked on this strange story. I wish the Coens would have made more movies like this.",Blood Simple
10,rmax304823,Stylish Thriller.,7,26 August 2008,"An early effort by the Coen brothers, this is a little like a short story stretched out to feature length but executed with so much suspense and panache that it hardly registers that we are on the scenic route rather than the expressway.Briefly, Frances McDormand, the wife of the moody and embittered Dan Hedaya, is having an affair with John Goetz, an employee of Hedaya's night club in Texas. Hedaya discovers the tryst through the services of the fat, wheezing, repulsive, but compliant private eye, M. Emmet Walsh.Hedaya confronts McDormand in her house of adultery and tries to drag her out to his car. McDormand is a tough babe though. She bites his index finger, spins around and kicks him firmly in the jewels. This comes close to being a cliché in scenes in which strong women are attacked by brutal men, and the scripts ordinarily call for the man to groan and clutch his groin for a moment before springing back to the attack. Not here. Hedaya is positively disabled, falls to his knees in pain, struggles back to his feet, stumbles towards his car, down on his knees again, and vomits.That little scene, in which most of our expectations are violated, is emblematic of the whole film. Nothing goes quite the way it was planned or the way we expect it to. A body that has been shot and remained motionless for hours in a pool of blood comes back to life unexpectedly. But not the way it's usually done, for shock value, as in so many slasher movies.At any rate, Hedaya re-hired Walsh to kill the pair of sinners and dispose of their bodies. Instead, Walsh double-crosses Hedaya and shoots him with McDormand's little revolver, leaving the weapon behind as a frame. Goetz discovers the body and the gun and, believing that McDormand was the shooter, disposes of Hedaya's half-dead body by burying it alive. I'll skip the ending.The Coen brothers have found themselves an honest and original style. And it IS original because it flies in the face of modern trends towards loud musical scores, instantaneous editing, wobbling cameras, shock cuts, lots of gutsy physicality, and a general sense of chaos. The pace is leisurely. Attention is paid to details, sometimes relevant (a forgotten cigarette lighter), sometimes not (the brass object on which a cigarette is stubbed out). But all add to the overall ambiance, with an effect similar to Hitchcock's but done quite differently. The art director should get a prize, but so should many other elements -- photography and lighting in particular. What I'm trying to get across is the notion that this -- and the Coen's subsequent films -- seems made for an adult audience rather than a horde of popcorn-eating, energy-drink-imbibing post adolescents. THAT audience will sit aghast during the climactic violence and wonder why they don't see any exploding squibs and why the accompanying score consists only of a muffled Mexican song from next door rather than some electronic, neuron-numbing, percussive assault.Since 1984, the Coens have had some ups and some downs. (The ups include the near-masterpiece ""Fargo"".) None of them have been less than interesting. They're a modest, shambling sort of team, the Coens, and judging from the way they look today, they must have been about nine years old when they made ""Blood Simple."" They're among the most individualistic and innovative writers and directors working today.See it.",Blood Simple
11,Tweekums,A delightful neo-noir from the Cohen Brothers,8,6 November 2017,"Texas bar owner Julian Marty suspects that his wife, Abby, is having an affair with Ray, one of his barmen so employs Loren Visser, a sleazy private detective to obtain evidence. It turns out that he was right; Abby is having an affair. He later decides that Abby and Ray need to die so offers Visser $10,000 to murder them. He agrees but rather than killing them he shoots Marty with a pistol he stole from Abby's house. Things soon get complicated as Ray finds Marty and the abandoned gun which leads to him thinking Abby shot him; getting rid of the body won't be easy even when this is done the problems are far from over; in fact they will get far greater before it is all over.This might not be the Cohen Brothers' best film but given that it was their first it is impressive and definitely hints at the great films to come. The story is somewhat complex, as each protagonist has a different idea of who did what to whom, but never confusing. Much of the action takes place at night; the darkness adding to the atmosphere. The cast does a fine job; Dan Hedaya really impresses as Marty, an intense character who it is easy to believe would pay to have somebody killed; M. Emmet Walsh is a lot of fun, and provides some laughs, as the sleazy detective; Frances McDormand is great as Abby, surprisingly her first film role; and John Getz is solid as Ray. While the film isn't exactly action packed there are moments of violence, some which might disturb some viewers this is especially true during the impressively tense finale. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of neo-noir or those who enjoy the Coen Brother's films.",Blood Simple
12,blanche-2,not really the same old song,8,26 June 2014,"Joel and Ethan Coen are two marvels. They write and produce black comedy like Fargo, bizarre films like Hudsucker Proxy, horror films (I think Barton Fink is one), films that will haunt you (No Country) -- in short, the brothers put their own stamp on any genre. In ""Blood Simple"" they've taken a familiar story and made it a thing of wonder.In stark Texas country, Abby (Frances McDormand), who is the wife of a mean bar owner Julian (Dan Hedaya) is having an affair with one of the bar workers. Ray (John Getz).Julian hires a PI, Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to spy on them. After he sees photos, he hires Visser to kill them. Should be simple. Isn't. Things go wrong -- very wrong. There's confusion, misunderstanding, botched work, wrong assumptions, and surprises, all leading to a tense conclusion.The dialogue is as sparse as the Texas countryside in this film. What's stunning about ""Blood Simple"" are the sounds -- water dripping, footsteps, water running, gunshots, breathing, running, doors opening -- which tell the story all by themselves. The buildup of suspense is palpable -- in the scenes between Hedaya and Walsh, you're a wreck, thinking something awful is about to happen; and that same fear of danger later appears between other characters. You begin not to know whom to trust, just as the characters look suspiciously at one another. The cast is wonderful; the character played by Walsh is very showy, but everyone is excellent.I have to say the Coens are my favorites. They manage to be different in an age where the big studios are doing cartoons, superhero films, and remakes. Their approach is always fresh, always quirky, and always appreciated.",Blood Simple
13,Quinoa1984,WOW,10,4 August 2000,"I saw this film for the first time tonight and even though it is a re-release from the original 1984 feature and not new, I found it to be one of the best films I've seen his year.  It is ingeniously done by It's actors and It's first time film-makers, Joel and Ethan Coen who bring such a disturbing film it makes Fargo look like Carebears.  And keep in mind I walked into this film without no knowledge of the story or characters, so that (and the people working on the film) made it entertaining.  The story is very complicated, but it involves a wife (Frances McDormand in a comanding first role) who is cheating on her husband's (Dan Hedaya is very good) bar worker (John Getz).  So, Hedaya gets a sleazy hitman guy (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill her wife and his lover.  But then it gets pretty messed up after that, and even though it takes place in Texas, it isn't a Chainsaw Massacre.  But, don't also be expecting a film that is cuddly also.  The picture is helped along the way not only by It's acting, writing and direction, but also by It's cinematography by now director Barry Sonnenfeld, who brings in a almost personality to the camera (like in the Coen's Raizing Arizona) and makes this film that much better. Definately a must see, especially for film-noir fans.  A++",Blood Simple
14,Coventry,Say hello to the best debut in cinema...EVER !,8,8 September 2003,"If you would think Scorsese, Coppola or Stone are the greatest living directors...you're wrong. Sure they're good but when it comes to pure talent...The Coen Brothers pale them all. Every single film they've produced is a masterpiece and this debut of them says all about their genius. Marty (Dan Hedaya) owns a bar in Texas. He hires a private detective to kill his cheating wife Abby and her lover Ray . This detective ( hilariously played by M.Emmet Walsh ) prefers to just earn the money without doing the killing and leaves him behind for death. Ray ( John Getz )thinks that Abby (a magnificent Frances McDormand) shot Marty and decides to finish the jobs and puts him under the ground. So actually, the whole basic story is already told before the movie pops open but if you think that's the end...you don't know the Coen brothers. Without using very much scary scenes they succeed to build up a unique tension and creepy atmosphere. The plot outline gets shook up a few times and you don't learn much by watching the very introvert characters. If you live yourself in completely, you start to play detective yourself and it's wonderful if a movie is able to make you do that. It's all a bit like the better Hitchcock movies ( including the filming-methods Coen uses ) Suspense is in the intelligent story !Basically...Blood Simple is nothing more than a cheap B-Movie...but a damn good one and a must see for all cult lovers. And that's how the Coen brothers will continue their career. Unpredictable but always very original. Although all their movies are very divergent, their unique ( and brilliant ) style can always be recognized. Just compare this film with the second one they made: Raising Arizona. They look completely different but still you can immediately point out they were made by the same guys. No one in the film industry puts his signature so clearly under a movie than Joel and Ethan do. And it seemed like true talent hooked up together in the early 80's. The Coen brothers were close friends to director Sam Raimi who made ( the also excellent debut ) Evil Dead. No, if you're looking for a little more than the usual cheesy Hollywood films...the Coen brothers are what you need. Their visual style and methods make them the greatest directors who ever lived. Typical for these guys is that their plot grow from simple to very complicated. Look out for that, you can find that in every single movie they made. They also have the privilege of working with Hollywoods ' finest actors. Frances McDormand to name one ( she sleeps with the director of course) but several others...The names in this first movie Blood Simple aren't the biggest out there but they're all over-talented.Blood Simple may be the best film of the 80's ( along with David Lynch's Blue Velvet) and also counts as one of the best ever made. A must see for every self-respecting fan of cinema...it's that SIMPLE !",Blood Simple
15,hitchcockthelegend,You know in Greece they cut off the head of the messenger who brought bad news.,9,14 March 2012,"Blood Simple is directed, written and produced by Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya, M. Emmet Walsh and Samm-Art Williams. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld.Suspecting his wife of having an affair with one of his bartenders, Texas bar owner Julian Marty (Hedaya) hires sleazy Private Investigator Loren Visser (Walsh) to find the proof. When that proof comes, a deal is struck to have the unfaithful couple killed, but this is merely the start of a sequence of events that prove that when blood is shed unlawfully, things are never simple.The Coen brothers announced themselves to the cinematic world in 1984 with this deadly neo-noir of some narrative substance, that's in turn resplendent with technical smarts. Taking their cue from the edgy film noirs of yesteryear, the Coen's wrap their own original bent for off kilter cinema around the vagaries of the human condition. The story always remains interesting throughout, continually keeping the viewer on their toes, managing to remain easy to understand, logical; and this in spite of some required convolution. Humid atmospherics are drip fed into the production, pulsing ceiling fans, seedy motel rooms, barely lighted highways and faces half bathed in shadow, Sonnenfeld's photography belying the low budget afforded production.The characters themselves are soon submerged in a world of misunderstandings, double crosses and murder, this as Carter Burwell lays a score over it that blends a slow piano death rattle with low base throbbing, invoking images of some down on his luck gangster from the 30s lamenting on a bar stool in some back street Speakeasy. Cast are uniformly excellent, but Walsh just about steals it with sleaze, greed and cold blood running through Visser's veins. The brothers Coen show some of what would become their trademark body bag humour, while some scenes have a disgustingly cruel (gleeful) edge to them. Script is as tight as a duck's bottom, with dialogue often sardonic, and the final 15 minutes of film, practically dialogue free, is a masterpiece of tension building.Quite a debut indeed. Essential neo-noir and not to be missed by those with a kink for such occasions. 9/10",Blood Simple
16,Scarecrow-88,Blood Simple,10,30 March 2007,"Abby(Frances McDormand, so beautiful and young)decides to have a torrid affair with Ray(John Getz), her husband's employee. She is just plain tired of her husband, Marty(Dan Hedaya)who runs a beer joint in Texas and is a little nutty. Loren Visser(M Emmet Walsh's finest hour)is a slimy PI who takes photographs of Ray and Abby together in a cheap motel bed. Loren is a porcine swine who will do just about anything for money and is willing to take as many lives as possible so that no trace of his crimes lead back to him. Marty is sick to his stomach with the adultery and calls on Loren to assassinate his wife and lover, erasing every trace of their existence. But, Loren has been eying Marty's safe which holds a lot of cash from the beer joint business..Complex, ultra-stylish neo-noir is beautifully photographed by MEN IN BLACK director Sonnenfeld on a tight budget. The southern drawl and location of Texas add atmosphere and a fresh take on the corrupt layers of old school noir where no one comes out unscathed and everyone has a skeleton in their closet. Joel and Ethan Coen show right away their abilities to develop a jerky plot which can shift into a different gear when it concerns motivational violence and betrayal. Especially interesting is how Marty seems to be the one who betrayed by all sides suffering because of those around his orbit. But, Marty's downfall is even consorting with the likes of Loren who has the appearance of an alligator with eyes slightly above water with intentions of striking it's prey. What happens to Marty makes up the macabre aspect of the plot..it is what ultimately sets up the confrontation between Loren and the star-crossed lovers.",Blood Simple
17,Doylenf,Gripping story builds toward a tense and taut finale slowly but surely...,7,31 March 2011,"The Coen brothers knew how to develop suspense, sometimes by having the actors pause for long times before speaking, which often accounts for the slow moving pace of this particular film, BLOOD SIMPLE. But it's an effective device for a thriller of this sort, giving the viewer a time to reflect on what might happen next. And very often, because of the brilliant (if convoluted) script, you'll guess wrong. That's the nature of the whole film. Completely unpredictable.It's a deceptively simple tale of a hired gun who turns the tables on the man who hires him to kill a bar owner's wife and lover. Nothing works out the way we assume it will. There are a series of fatal mistakes and human errors weaving their way through a labyrinth of plot twists in a way that is totally unpredictable but always fascinating and taut with suspense.***** Possible spoiler ahead ***** The scene that stays in my mind the most is the shovel scene with the victim about to be buried alive. It's photographed with utmost care so that the barren Texas landscape makes the man's impending doom even more bleak and the fact that nobody can possibly save him under the circumstances even though he feebly manages to get hold of a gun.The acting is well done but not always first rate. JOHN GETZ seems a bit too muted as the slow-witted bartender, but FRANCES McDORMAND, DAN HEDAYA and M. EMMET WALSH bring well crafted skill to their roles.However, it's more of a director's film than an actor's showcase, but so realistically handled that it's guaranteed to keep any viewer wondering what unforeseen mishap will shape the next event. At times the pace is deliberately slow, especially in scenes where the accent is on dialog and not action.Highly recommended for any fan of the Coen Brothers and their special talent for suspenseful crime stories.Summing up: Beware of several gory sequences that are definitely not for the squeamish.",Blood Simple
18,preppy-3,An indie classic,7,24 July 2000,"This is the film that gave independent filmmakers hope.  Made on no budget, it got a release and was a modest success at the box office.  I saw it in 1984 and wasn't too impressed.  The plot is familar and the movie has dull sequences.  Also, characters act like total idiots, it gets VERY gruesome at the end and (with the sole exception of Walsh) the acting is pretty bad (especially Getz--very handsome with a nice bod, but he can't act).  Seeing it again in 2000, my feelings haven't changed.  I do like the movie somewhat and it did start the indie revolution but the plot holes are very obvious (what happened the the husband's dog?) and it's kind of dull.  It's well-directed (there are incredible shots) but pretty pictures don't make a movie.  Worth seeing, but don't expect much.",Blood Simple

Joel and Ethan have done some marvelous work (Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Intolerable Cruelty) and I am looking forward to their next (No Country for Old Men).You know what has happened, but the characters are all in the dark. It is interesting to see what they do when they haven't a clue. It is a mix of merciless violence and black comedy.

Clearly they got better with experience, as this is far from flawless (unlike Big Lebowski, Fargo and No Country for Old Men). The plot has a few holes and improbabilities in it, and the acting isn't entirely convincing.

21,view_and_review,Blood Simple Anything But,2,16 October 2019,"Blood Simple is an oxymoron because nothing was simple about this movie. It was a twisted plot with twisted characters.

The hubby, Marty (Dan Hedaya), knew about the affair from a private investigator. Marty, however weak and pathetic he was, was a man after all and couldn't let it go so he employs the same private eye (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill the illicit lovers. Nothing went according to plan after that and it was all wacky.This was one of those movies where I didn't like any character.

23,AlsExGal,First outing for the Coens is an outstanding 80's film noir thriller,9,24 July 2015,"This is the Coen brothers' directorial film debut, and not only is it different from most other films in the Coens' catalog of work, it is just a different kind of film altogether. With a budget of just a little more than one million dollars and four main characters, the Coen brothers created a film noir thriller 35 years after the genre had expired. In this film the Coens demonstrate that if you have a conscience, a killing can be hard to carry out, but regardless of whether or not you have a conscience, a killing is hard to get away with.Throughout the film, as is true in many film noirs, the audience is kept aware of most of what is really going on, which is a grand misunderstanding with very tragic consequences. The four characters are all being misled by the incomplete part of the jigsaw puzzle that each of them possesses. The setup is simple enough: Ray is having an affair with Abby, wife of his evil boss Marty. Marty gets angry about the situation and decides to pay a private eye to murder both of them. Things proceed to go as badly as possible for everyone from that point on as each of our characters are mainly motivated by mistrust - even the young lovers Ray and Abby.What makes Blood Simple different from other Coen brothers films is he complete lack of humor throughout the entire film. Even the bleak ""Fargo"" is sprinkled with humor throughout. Equally noticeable is the cold remoteness that fills every square inch of this film which includes everything from Abby's Texas-sized apartment, to the flat open stretches of Texas landscape. This cold remoteness just seems to magnify the quiet terror of what is going on. For in this movie, the spilling of blood isn't clean, easy, or free of emotional consequence. For example, when one character is in the process of burying the ""body"" of someone he believed had been murdered by someone else, he finds out, much to his surprise, that the person is actually still alive. Now faced with the ""necessity"" of killing this person to cover up the crime, he finds the task impossible to do in a clean quick way - with a rifle. As a result, he winds up actually killing the person in the most horrible way possible - by simply ignoring the fact that he is still alive and burying him anyway - all because he is too queasy to commit the overt act of shooting someone himself. As we witness the sun come up on a day bereft of the life of the deceased and the entombment complete, it's very relieving to remember it's only a movie.None of this is to say that Blood Simple isn't an enjoyable film. Seeing the characters and their lives come apart one by one will keep you riveted to your seat. We already know ""who done it,"" we're just hanging around to see if the other characters figure out not only ""who done it"", but what it is that has been done in the first place. All the cast members were great and Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya, and M. Emmett Walsh have gone on to bigger and better things since this movie was made. I just wonder what happened to John Getz, since he performed just as well as the other three only to remain largely unknown. With the exception of a small part in the remake of ""The Fly"" in 1986, I can't think of another film in which I've seen him.In summary, the best thing about Blood Simple is that even if we always know what's happening, we never know what's going to happen next up to the very end. Highly recommended.",Blood Simple
24,ferguson-6,Many classic visual shots,9,20 July 2000,"Blood Simple features two of the best character actors in the history of Hollywood - M. Emmit Walsh and Dan Hedaya.  Gene Siskel had a saying that any movie with M. Emmit Walsh was worth seeing.  Additionally, the Cohen's present a dark tale with characters who always seem a step behind what is happening to them (although the audience is ""in"" on everything).  On your second viewing, check out the series of individual shots throughout the movie that create the mood for each scene.  Notice the progression of the glass of milk in each subsequent shot, or the fly on Walsh's head.  So many little details, not to mention a superb story, make this a movie worth seeing a few times. The movie is making the rounds as a ""Director's Cut"", so you should try and catch it at a theatre.

Emmet Walsh, Samm-Art Williams: Compelling thriller about the toxic poison of consumed hatred. It regards trust and the idea of murder that sounds simple enough to commit until other factors complicate matters. Set in a small Texas town, Dan Hedaya glares at photos of his wife in bed with an employee so he hires a sleazy detective to kill them. Unfortunately a double cross occurs that proves fatal. Thrilling screenplay places one factor against another until the strongest and smartest remains. When Ray discovers a dead body along with Abby's gun his mind is in turmoil. Remarkable triumph by Joel and Ethan Coen as their very first film. M. Emmet Walsh steals the film as a sadistic detective who delights in the depraved but fails to factor his own judgement and pride before fatality hits. Hedaya is superb as a vengeful husband whose rage leads to betrayal and downfall. Frances McDormand is terrific as the unfaithful Abby who is guilty but resourceful. John Getz plays the confused Ray whose emotions are pulled in several directions without answers as he gets in too deep and suffers ultimately. Theme demonstrates how hate can transform into devastation while taking aim at victims we cannot see and the voice we cannot match with our expectations. Score: 10 / 10",Blood Simple

I won't say it's a bad movie, I'm sure it looked even better in 1984, but compared to the other movies they made later on it just falls short. It's not a jewel like Fargo, The Big Lebowski, Bad Santa, No Country for Old Men, or The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, but I guess there has to be a beginning for everything. Film Noir is also not my favorite genre of movies so that didn't help either. The story is okay to watch and the acting isn't bad either, with M. Emmet Walsh as the most interesting one to watch in this movie. Blood Simple is just a nice start for greater movies to come from the Coen brothers.",Blood Simple
27,christopher-underwood,a crazy burial scene,9,2 December 2017,"Whenever this film has come up in conversation, I have always said how good it is but barely remembering much beyond a wincingly tense scene involving a window, a crazy burial scene and the fact that the image was always very dark. That viewing must have been on some less than wonderful video because although most of the film is shot at night, it looks marvellous. Indeed, the visuals, the dialogue, the use of music, the pacing and the performances are near faultless. I still feel that burial scene is a bit too crazy but then allowing for the delirious state the main protagonist was in maybe it is fine, just not what any thinking person would choose to do. But no matter because it makes for great viewing, as does the entire film. There are moments when we do not know quite what is going on (and doubt the characters do too) but this is noir or at least neo- noir and that's all good.",Blood Simple

No sumptuous sets, elaborate costuming, etc. Rather, ""BS"" is a simple tale of simple people told in a simple way which has been lauded by critics and public alike. How the Coen's could pull off such a coup with such a simple indie is the art and the paradox of ""BS"".

29,MovieAddict2016,Solid early thriller from the Coens.,8,4 May 2005,"""Blood Simple"" is a very good thriller from the Coen Brothers, their first movie, and it already shows their craft taking form -- the absurd violence punctuated by comical moments, the spiralling events that careen out of control, the soundtrack, the camera techniques... everything's already here and it was only their first effort.This isn't as good as ""Fargo"" but it is more of a straight thriller than a mix of genres. It's darker, more grimy, and more serious; ""Touch of Evil"" meets ""Detour."" It's got all the elements of classic film noir while maintaining a good level of dark humor that helps elevate the material.The film follows the events in the lives of Abbey (Frances McDormand), Ray (John Getz) and Marty (Dan Hedaya). Abbey and Marty are unhappily married; when Marty finds out his wife has been having an affair with one of his bartenders, Ray, he hires an unscrupulous detective by the name of Visser (played perfectly by M. Emmett Walsh) to kill them both.Visser has his own plans and decides to try and take the money for free - Marty dies... or does he? And then Ray gets involved and the title ""blood simple"" really comes into play. (It is used to describe the after-effects in the mentality of a person who has just killed.) ""Blood Simple"" reminds me a bit of ""Evil Dead,"" which seems apt since the Coens supposedly modeled their film after Sam Raimi's efforts and even made a teaser trailer with Bruce Campbell playing the Marty character. It isn't a ""horror"" film but maintains the same dark vibe as ""Evil Dead"" and has a ridiculous amount of oozing blood and gore. The grave burial scene is also pretty sickening and something out of an ""Evil Dead"" movie.""Blood Simple"" is a really good thriller. As a low-budget indie flick from the '80s it is very impressive and as the Coens' directorial debut it remains a fascinating example of their skills. It is not, in my opinion, as perfectly sculpted or humorous as ""Fargo"" (which is my favorite film of the Coens) but it doesn't mean to be -- it is a straightforward film noir thriller and in that regard it remains one of the best of all time.",Blood Simple
30,Red-Barracuda,A neo-noir thriller par excellence,10,2 March 2012,"This really is a superbly confident debut film by anybody's standards. Since this film was released, the Coen brothers have forged a career as major film-makers whose films have remained left-field. Blood Simple is a neo-noir with unusual character inter-actions. Its story is on the face of it very simple. A Texas bar owner hires a sleazy private investigator to kill his philandering wife and lover; the latter being one of his bar staff. Things do not exactly go to plan however.What marks this typical noir story out though is in the way that once the crime story is under way, none of the four principle characters ever has a clue what the others are doing. Only we in the audience know what is going on, except even we sure don't know what's going to happen next. It's essentially a story about people who cannot communicate honestly. Each person mistrusts the other and this tension is manipulated expertly so ensure the story is consistently surprising and suspenseful, while remaining completely believable. The characters always act in ways that can be justified given what they know and wrongly assume. The initial decision by the bar owner to resort to murder sets off a chain of events that leads all four characters on a path that can only end very badly. The idea of structuring a story around people with limited knowledge is one that the Coens would return to in Fargo, another film where we in the audience have a privileged viewpoint of a group of people acting out a deadly chain-reaction. Also, similar to No Country for Old Men, this one uses another Coen trait where some characters never actually meet face-to-face despite being inextricably linked in the story. So even at the start of their career the Coens had formulated some ideas they would return to again.It has a great cast too. Dan Hedaya is shady while remaining essentially sympathetic as the bar owner; John Getz and Frances McDormand are very good as the paranoid lovers; while M. Emmett Walsh is best of all as the amoral private eye. Also of particular note is the music by Carter Burwell. The central moody theme is particularly wonderful. In summary, it's a superb crime-thriller, plotted expertly with a deadly precision. One of the great films from the 80's.",Blood Simple
31,sol1218,These are the signs by which we shall know them,8,4 February 2005,"***SPOILERS*** A slew of miscalculations on the part of everyone involved makes this first major motion picture by the Coen Brothers the modern Film-Noir classic that it eventually became. Set deep in the heart of Texas the movie ""Blood Simple"" involves bar/nightclub owner Marty, Dan Hedaya, who suspects he wife Abby, Frances McDormand, is cheating on him. Hiring Private Investagator Loren Visser, M. Emmet Walsh, to find the proof Visser come up with a number of photos of Abby having an affair with one of Marty's workers at the nightclub Ray, John Getz,who he fires. Marty tells Ray not to step into his nightclub again, even to get his two week salary that Marty owes him,if he doesn't want to get shot and killed.Later Marty goes to Ray's house and attacks Abby who he found there, only to get his right pointer finger almost bit off by her as well as getting a hard kick by Abby to his mid-section leaving Marty gasping for air. Hurt and humiliated by what happened to him Marty again gets in contact with PI Visser. This time Marty wants Visser to murder both Abby and Ray, with their bodies never being found and offers him $10,000.00 to do the job. Visser who at first hesitated agrees to do the ""hit"" on the two lovers but what Marty doesn't know is that the ""hit"" that Visser is planing is going to be on him. Visser plans to frame Marty's wife Abby and her boyfriend Ray for Martys murder with him taking of with Marty's $10,000.00. What Visser doesn't realize is that in real life nothing happens the way it's planned and his plan in the end backfires on him with fatal results. Strange and haunting crime/drama where those on screen have no idea of whats happening in the movie, unlike the audience, even when the film is finally over. There's long stretches of time, as much as ten minutes, in the film ""Blood Simple"" where there's no dialog at all but it's that very reason that makes the movie so effective. Dan Hedaya is both creepy and weird as bar owner Marty in wanting to have his wife Abby and her lover Ray iced for good. M. Emmet Walsh is as sleazy as they come as the Private Eye who's manipulating Marty as well as Abby and Ray in his sinister plan to commit the ""Perfect Crime"" at their expense. John Getz as Ray is caught up with the goings on behind the scenes by the manipulative Visser and induced to commit a murder that he really had nothing to do with but unknowing finished the job that Visser started.Frances McDormand as Abby is totally confused when Ray, thinking that she killed Marty, tries to tell her that he covered up the murder not knowing that she had nothing to do with it. Solid murder drama that shows that a good and imaginative script thats skillfully directed with a cast of unknowns can achieve as much if not more, without the tons of cash dumped into it by a major Hollywood studio.",Blood Simple
32,ElMaruecan82,A Nightmatish Cinematic Experience ... driven by a Perfect Script ...,10,17 March 2011,"There's a powerful moment in « Blood Simple » that perfectly captures the whole nightmarish feeling of the Coens brothers' directorial debut. After discovering what looks to be a dead body with blood dripping like so many accusing bombs, one man tries to clean up the place and get rid of the stains... and the more he tries, the bloodier it gets. This is the endless sentiment that I couldn't get rid of while watching this film, it's a bloody nightmare ... lived by every character, each one participating of an intricate plot made of revelations, lies, suspicions and double crossings that go beyond their understanding. Basically, no one understands what's really happening, but WE do, because it is one of the most well-written and fascinating modern thrillers, where for once, every thing makes sense at the end. It's ""Blood Simple"".I love the ironic poetry carried by the title, based on the fact that all the characters of this film don't know what happens to them. Marty, the cheated husband, portrayed by an extraordinary pitiful Dan Hedaya, is victim of his own jealousy, which lead him to hire an unscrupulous private detective named Loren Visser, to kill his wife and her lover. The poor guy didn't know he made himself an obvious target, allowing Loren to kill him with his wife's weapon. Loren Visser, superbly interpreted by M. Emmet Walsh, is both the villain and the mastermind of a vicious plot where he also made himself a victim through one single mistake, advising his victim to go fishing, which indirectly hid the only piece of conviction accusing him, his lighter. Now to the lovers: Ray, portrayed by Joe Getz has been warned by Marty that Abby, the wife, would try to fool him, to play innocent, and what a twist when in the next scene, a simple unanswered phone call, almost implies that she's hiding something. And of course, when Ray finds Marty's dead body, with Abby's weapon, even his love is not enough to kill the suspicion. And the Palm of the irony is for Abby, the sweet and (really) innocent wife played by a young and adorable Frances McDormand, who still believes Marty is the killer, even at the end. So they all harm and fool each other, knowingly or unconsciously, they're all like puppets whose strings are pulled by terrific plots writers. ""Blood Simple"" is simply one of the best written plots with the exquisite irony that no one will ever know the truth, except us, for our precious cinematic delight.So, with a minimalist cast, with pretty unknown faces, the Coen Brothers made a spectacular breakthrough entrance into the cinematic world, defining their most famous style: a mix of dark humor and noirish atmosphere. ""Blood Simple"" is a thrilling experience, whose short length is enough to provide you a mixture of sensations like only Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense, could have concocted. I'm sure Hitchcock himself would have been proud to make such a brilliant noir film. And this is not an overstatement: there's a dreamy atmosphere inhabiting this film, plunging us through the darkest psychological depths. We smell Marty's stinky jealousy and self-pity, through his heinous eyes, and ferret face, as we can almost touch Ray's paranoia with his vibrating eyes while Abby utters precisely the same words Marty predicted. Of course, the nightmarish feeling is the greatest and most perceptible homage to Hitchcock. The cleaning of the crime's setting is a reminiscence of Norman Bates murder's aftermath. Loren Visser coming back to the same place to find the accusing lighter reminds of ""Frenzy"", when the killer tried to retake the piece of conviction from the hand of his dead victim. But if psychology and Hitchcokian homages are one thing, showing a perfect mastery of writing is an incredible demonstration of virtuosity. The film strangely reminds of another masterpiece: ""Stray Dog"" from Kurosawa, which was about a young police officer who's been robbed a colt, with 7 bullets. The plot is so neat and fluid that you always know how many bullets are left. And each remaining bullet plays a pivotal role in the story. This achievement is a credit to the powerful writing, and the Coen Brothers for a cinematic debut proves they're among the best screenwriters of their generation. Not only each bullet has a role, but every single scene serves a purpose without looking forced, everything, from the lighter to the fishes, from the gun to the bullets, is important, nothing is wasted in an almost scientific perfectionism. The first bullet kills, the second accidentally warns that there's a gun here. One is almost shot when, in the infamous burial scene, Marty in a last self-preservation instinct, tries to kill Ray, BUT his finger was broken and could hardly shoot. He missed twice but Ray had enough time to get rid of it, keeping the precious bullet for Abby who finally concluded the movie after one of the most thrilling climactic sequences ever. It's a movie that indecently flirts with the way I personally fantasize about cinematic perfection.And even the music is impacting, with the tenebrous score communicating the heavy presence of an imminent fatality, it's like everything is already settled. But if the 'piano' theme is the most reflecting element of the film's atmosphere. The music I immediately associate with ""Blood Simple"" is the ""Same Old Song"" from the mythic Four Tops. A kind of 'feel good' song that grows on you as it conveys the nostalgic feeling that suits the film even better now, as to remind us of the Coens' precocious achievement ... You're sweet as a honey bee; but like a honey bee stings, you've gone and left my heart in pain...",Blood Simple

Emmet Walsh. McDormand plays a married woman who is having an affair and we're told it's one of many, but unlike other femme fatales, she's actually confused most of the time as to what's going on between her husband (Dan Hedaya) and lover (John Getz). Walsh is a private detective with an easy-going persona, but also very few scruples. I won't spoil the plot except to say it's a story where crimes go south and due to bungling or misunderstandings, spiral. There are lots of chilling moments but the soundtrack was wisely subdued, and fit the mood of the film perfectly. It's strongest in its first half, getting a little complicated in the way the second half was told, but ends beautifully.

This is still a great movie and while not as good as ""Fargo"", still worth checking out. This really did remind me of that movie. I think it had something to do with driving at night and stopping over with having to deal with a dead body. The music is amazing.That scene taking place in the night has no dialogue. I think it's actually the best part of the entire movie, because you truly let the atmosphere tell the story here. I really do associate with the people in this movie and I do get the main romance.

It was obvious too the lover was not supposed to get back to the bar of the cuckold, find the dead body – but was he dead really – and then get rid of it in some field, a live burial mind you. It was obvious the private eye should not have forgotten his lighter in the office of the cuckold bar owner because that could only cause the death of an innocent, well, an innocent, way of speaking for a cuckold maker – isn't it what they call coveting the wife of your neighbor in some sacred books? – in the most spectacular way possible. In the same way that the lighter will put the sleuth on the tracks of the lady of the tale and there the Coen Brothers are going to be best of them all and it is the most un-innocent and guilty man who will finally pay – the hard way – the bill of that adulteress.

40,filipemanuelneto,"One of the early works of the Cohen Brothers, is interesting, but rather slow.",6,27 December 2017,"This is another ""film noir"" signed by the Cohen Brothers, who sign the direction and the script. One more on a sizable list, as they like the ""noir"" style and a clever twist of cynical irony. However, this film isn't new and I don't know to what extent it will age well, or it will turn into a minor work of Cohens' cinematography.The film has many interesting aspects, mainly in the most technical questions. Cinematography is very elegant and cleverly uses the light and shadow, high contrast, washed colors and car headlights. Although I don't have any data in my hands right now, I dare to hypothesize that they have used wide-angle lenses during filming. I'm just guessing. However, the main problem of this film is the script.The whole plot is based on a love triangle between Abby, her lover, Ray, and her husband, Marty, who decides to kill them, driven by jealousy, corrupting a private investigator to do the dirty work. But things end up going bad for Marty and everything gets complicated, as the plot gives several twists. The virtual absence of soundtrack, the focus on dialogue, the atmosphere of latent suspicion between characters and their moral ambiguity are characteristics that we can see, and that are usual in ""noir"" movies. This is all very good and would have been even better if there weren't problems in between: to begin with, the film takes too long to engage and arouse our interest. In fact, the beginning is too slow to have a significant initial impact. Dialogues can also be very boring. Finally, there is another problem: it is absolutely loaded with holes. If I were a CSI technician, it would have been the quickest and easiest criminal investigation of my career.About as the actors, I liked them overall, but I was not impressed. John Getz and Frances McDormand, despite being the main actors, didn't shined, doing only what they had to do. Dan Hedaya had the task of giving life to an obnoxious but fundamental character, and I liked his work. However, I think M. Emmet Walsh deserves more prominence than them. It's through the cynical and obtuse look of his character that we see the film (he works, partly, as a narrator) and it's he who assumes preponderance in the way events unfold, giving him a protagonism that would hardly have had if wasn't the case. The actor really struggled, so the character can almost be absolutely repellent by embodying, in a visual and palpable way, his dubious morality and lack of scruples.In short, this is an interesting worth-watching movie but may not please most of the audiences, as it's rather slow and takes it's time to develop. However, being one of the first Cohen's films, it's a milestone for their careers.",Blood Simple

With this being their debut, it's abundantly clear that their stylistic and personal approach to cinema was outset immediately, with their typical directing tropes littering the pitch black roads with a presumed dead body in the back of the car. It's as beautiful as it is brutal, two clashing tones complementing each other through their unique perspective. It just works effortlessly. After discovering that his wife is having an affair, a business owner pays a hitman to murder them both when the objective suddenly becomes very awry.There are always two elements to a Coens film that takes precedent, and are almost certain to be celebrated aspects upon reflection. The direction and the screenplay. Joel has a substantial amount of control that exhumes confidence, whether it be personifying existential delirium or simply portraying the blood-splattering brutality. He, much like the grotesque onscreen characters, shows no remorse and produces a debut that would cement his talents for years to come. The gorgeous cinematography from Sonnenfeld highlighting the lawless neon-lit bar and the extensive range of varied camera techniques showcasing his talent even further. The POV shots when driving along the dusky road were sublime to say the least, and enhanced that noir flair oozing from page to screen. No surprise he became a director years later.Ethan's screenplay explores the fearful mindsets of modern civilians succumbing to extended immersions of violent scenarios. The trademark humour found in a typical Coen Brothers feature certainly found its footing in this debut. The most particular moment being when we discover Marty is miraculously still alive momentarily. It's often sharp, however I find with most of Ethan's screenplays to be somewhat wordy. And by that, I mean scenes of excess dialogue are prolonged without any substantial development or depth. Notably the conversations between Ray and Abby in bed hold no purpose and allow the tightly wound suspense to dissipate, meaning Joel has to crank it up again. This mostly occurs in the second act, but it's a criticism I find all too common with their films.Acting was good. Nothing particularly special as I believe the technical aspects outweigh the theatrical performances, however McDormand, in what was her debut, gave the most nuanced and relatable portrayal. Getz and Hedaya played off Ethan's humour with natural flair. One major flaw, especially in the theatrical cut, was the editing. So many scenes would be randomly cut in order to proceed with the next scene in order to progress with the story with a sense of urgency. Ray would be talking to Abby on a public phone, when suddenly an abrupt scene transition would find themselves in bed together.The lack of narrative flow seriously endangered the story. Fortunately the plot itself was engrossing enough to bypass the majority of amateurish editing issues, with Blood Simple being a brutal exercise in directional showcasing for filmmaking ingenuity.",Blood Simple
43,Ed-Shullivan,Dan Hedaya was robbed. He should have been nominated for an Oscar for his role,9,28 March 2018,"The Cohen brothers did a marvellous job in delivering a suspenseful film noir in which a tavern owner named Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) is betrayed by his wife Abby (Frances McDormand) who is having an extra marital affair with one of Julian's tavern employee's named Ray (John Getz). Julian wants to confirm his suspicions so he hires an overweight and slimy private detective named Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to follow his wife Abby to see if she is in fact involved in a sexual relationship with Ray.Not only does Loren Visser confirm Julian's worst suspicions about his wife Abby's sexual relationship with Ray, Loren gleefully provides to Julian some compromising photographs of Abby and Ray that take Julian by surprise and lead to his wanting to confront his wife Abby about her affair. Julian's reaction to seeing those dirty photos sends him over the edge and when his attempt to physically pull Abby out of the arms of her lover Ray fails, Julian reluctantly seeks the assistance of the slimy private detective Loren Visser once again. Julian wants Loren Visser to murder his wife Abby and her lover Ray and do away with their bodies where no one will ever find them.The plot thickens and the four main characters in this Cohen brother film noir being Abby (Frances McDormand), her lover Ray (John Getz), Abby's revenge filled husband Julian (Dan Hedaya), and the overweight slimy Private Detective Loren Visser (M. Emmett Walsh) who Julian hires carry this film from beginning to end with a generous amount of intrigue sprinkled in as well as to whom really betrays whom. This is in my humble opinion an under rated film noir and respecting of more recognition than the over rated (1990) Millers Crossing. I thought Dan Hedaya's portrayal of the tavern owner Julian Marty whose employee barman and wife are having an illicit affair right under his nose and in his attempt to seek revenge results in his own destruction is poignant. The betrayal by all four of the key characters is what makes this Cohen brothers film deserving of belonging in the criterion collection. I give this fast paced film noir a nine (9) out of ten (10) rating. Dan Hedaya was definitely robbed and should have been Oscar nominated for either a Best Actor or at least Best Supporting Actor for his emotional and vengeful portrayal of Julian Marty.",Blood Simple
44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Rise of the Coens: a memorable test run,8,27 July 2011,"There's something comforting in visiting (or revisiting) the Coen brothers' origins more than 25 years after their debut with ""Blood Simple."" Although not their best work by any means, ""Blood Simple."" laid a foundation that proved beyond refute what the filmmakers would continue to build upon in their careers. ""Blood Simple."" shows not only the continuity of their work, but also their devotion to particular brand of storytelling.As we've come to know them for, the Coens have spun a tale of ordinary people in un-ordinary (and difficult/illegal) situations, flailing like fish out of water as some recurring symbolism might suggest. Wealthy bar owner Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) hires a private investigator (M. Emmet Walsh), a cowboy to the gills plus a 10-gallon hat, to spy on his two-timing wife (Frances McDormand) and her current lover and Marty's employee, Ray (John Getz). Tired of feeling inadequate, Marty pays the investigator to off them, but things don't go quite as he suspects.A series of dominoes fall in which all of the main characters end up over their heads based on a disconnect between what they believe to have happened and the reality (that we the audience see firsthand).Other than McDormand, who would marry one of the brothers and become a staple in their films, the major difference between ""Blood Simple."" and their prime work would be the acting. Walsh and Hedaya fit their roles well, but Getz, a rather critical character, can't seem to pull it off. He plays something between frightened and stupid. Fortunately we're so intrigued by what the consequences of his pivotal scenes will be that we're mostly distracted from thinking about how much better the film could've been if he could fit the bill. The Coens' films have always needed a combination of actors who can pull off ordinary people and those who can be a bit larger than life but in a controlled way. Walsh pulls off the latter as the private investigator and McDormand as the former, which makes the climax work quite well.Connecting the dots of the film can be difficult at times. The story lacks a sense of justice and authority (as simple as having a police detective in the script), which makes it impossible to predict the film's outcome in exciting fashion and blurs the lines between good and evil. Just as the Coens wanted, to be sure, but some residual effects seem to linger that makes the characters tough to understand in terms of motivations. In the end, something ends up going missing from the poignancy of the film, but for a first crack at that type of major climax poignancy, they do all right. At the same time, one would be hard pressed to call the film's flaws rookie mistakes by any means. Few filmmakers demonstrate the visual prowess, the innate ability to understand where the audience's eyes will go, what it will focus in on and the way in which it will process that information.What a treat to see these talents feeling their way through a first full-length feature and how they've improved.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Blood Simple

46,imseeg,THE Ultimate Coen Brother's Classic. Their first. Their most haunting and disturbing. ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE !!!,10,15 January 2020,"It's simply of no use trying to describe this story in detail for first time viewers, because it cant be told without giving away spoilers. I'll try anyway in 5 sentences:It's a tale about lust and envy, about a man who finds out his wife is cheating on him and this betrayal eats him up alive. Blood Simple is a gruelling tale about human sins. It's violently wicked. And mentally haunting...Beware: this classic starts out rather slow, without showing any signs of being a masterpiece at all at first. That's the only thing I wanna warn first time viewers for. This movie only slowly, but steadily gets more and more wicked AND haunting after the first half hour. So please dont judge this movie before it's first 30 minutes have passed, the CLIMAX is definitely at the very end.The true movie fan of mentally haunting thriller/dramas will recognize the magnificent direction right away, because man oh man does this movie get me by my throat. It slowly strangles me, really sneakily creeps up on me, without me even noticing at first that I am slowly descending in a haunting deathtrap of cinematic human evil and mental pain. Mind you, I have seen this classic about 20 times already and still I am shocked and in absolute awe of it every single time...!!!",Blood Simple
47,videorama-759-859391,"An ageless masterpiece, 85, Coen style, with it's bloody moments",10,20 March 2014,"In my opinion this is still the Coen brothers piece of resistance, or words to that effect. It still stands superior to everything else they've done, where I'm sure a lot of other people would disagree, or just haven't seen one this too. They f..kin should. The score of performances are great, particularly M Emmett Walsh, though I liked Hedaya's anger too. He's a jealous, and mentally unstable bar owner, who suspects his wife (Francis Mcdormand) excellent as she always is, is getting it on with younger employer (John Getz) an actor's 80's surprise, of versatility when seeing him in other films. He's hired corrupt and tubby PI, (Dan Visser Walsh, in a real evil performance of menace, images of him, will be locked in your mind after) to do some snooping around, and he comes up trumps kind of taunting Hedaya with the negatives. Now Hedaya's anger is beyond the point of sanity, where he pays a very generous sum to Walsh to take the two out. It's here when the thriller really takes it's turns and becomes fun, but believable too, after Walsh double crosses Hedaya. That's what's cool about it. The less I say now, the better. My only point I want to get across to you Coen fans out there, if you haven't seen their baby yet, that still holds the test of time, you must. It's a stylish film noir thriller, that moves at an easing pace, which is necessary and comes off all so brilliantly. And too there's the ending that shows another sense of style.",Blood Simple
48,freemantle_uk,A fantastic debut from two brilliant filmmakers,10,27 April 2010,"The Coen Brothers are clearly recognised as two of the best filmmakers around, making well know classics like Miller's Crossing, Fargo, The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men. They are skilled writers, directors and producers and their films are often made independently. They have often made dramas and comedies. Whilst most director's first feature film is often a chance to test their skills and learn from trial and error, The Coen Brothers were able to make a great film the first time round.Blood Simple is a dark tale of murder and deceit in rural Texas. Abby (Frances McDormand) is an unhappily married woman who starts to have an affair with Ray (John Getz), her husband's bar manager. But the two don't know that they are watched by a private detective (M. Emmet Walsh), hired by Abby's husband Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya). When Marty gets humiliated by the two he offers to pay the detective $10,000 to kill them. But Marty is double crossed and the detective murders him and pockets the money.Whilst even in the Coen Brothers more serious effort they still find room for some lighter moments: but with Blood Simple it is a straight up, gritty story of murder and its implications. The Coen Brothers were able to assemble an excellent cast who play real, faulted characters. Some of them are very dodgy and hardly likable, but real and makes the audience care about happens to them. Abby was on the only really likable character whilst Samm-Art Williams plays a very down to Earth man who is unaware of everything that goes on. The plot on the surface seems simple and is easy to follow in a short running time, which is always a good thing in films; the Coen Brothers were able to explore some more complex issues. They ensure that the film is grounded, a event that could really happen and that murder is a very bloody, unconformable aware. The Coen Brothers also sorted to show the psychological toll that murder may have on someone.The Coen Brothers show their skill with Cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld (who ended up as a successful director himself). They shot the film with a dark, gritty camera style have some wonderful images throughout, from a dark moment when Ray is out in the darkness of the area and even something simple when the camera follows Samm-Art Williams feet. They are long moments when there is little sound at all, but the directors were able to make the story and the actions so compelling that the audience will be totally engrossed by it.If you like Blood Simple then Fargo and No Country for Old Men are must see films.",Blood Simple
49,ackstasis,"""I ain't done nothing funny.""",6,14 September 2007,"I can't quite place my finger on why I didn't like this film. 'Blood Simple' was the first feature from acclaimed brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, and yet it had a certain roughness that I couldn't connect with. I suppose that the simplest way to explain my feelings would be as follows: 'Blood Simple' is an ultra-low-budget amateur film, and it feels exactly like one. This needn't necessarily be a negative; if a film acknowledges its low-budget roots, it can use this fact to great advantage. My problem with the Coen's film is that it simply looked cheaply-made, and that detracted massively from a work that was clearly trying to evoke the spirit of some of the smoothly-made, classic film noirs of the 1940s and 50s.Ordinarily, I might be tempted to put the film's ""visual cheapness"" down to the directors' ultra low-budget, but, in this case, we already know that the Coens would later becoming masters of creating something from nothing. For example, working on a comparatively low budget (though, admittedly, not as low as this one), they would go on to produce 'Miller's Crossing,' among the most handsome motion pictures of the 1990s. 'Blood Simple,' conversely, just looks uncertain, crudely-constructed and, ultimately, like the work of amateurs. The plot of the film is something that we've already seen dozens of times, but I suspect that this was the Coens' intention. Like many of their films, they were not attempting anything strikingly original, but rather chose to reproduce the spirit of many of the classic film noirs, and to sprinkle it with their own unique brand of twisted black humour. I've certainly enjoyed many of their similar later films, but this one, I thought, missed the mark.The cast is very small, with most of the film focusing almost exclusively on four characters. This helps create a sense of intimacy, though it also acts as another cold reminder of the minuscule budget on which they must have been working. The acting itself is a bit variable: I wasn't overly fond of John Getz as Ray, but his arch enemy, Julian Marty, is played with genuinely repulsive sliminess by Dan Hedaya. I suppose that Frances McDormand was pretty good as Abby  Marty's wife and Ray's lover  but the sheer stupidity of her character often frustrated me, coupled with her seemingly constant nervousness and feigned innocence. However, on the other end of the scale, M. Emmet Walsh is a complete revelation as Loren Visser, the nasty, crude cowboy private investigator whom Marty hires to murder his adulterous wife and her lover. As you can guess, things don't quite go to plan.As a debut film, I have to acknowledge that 'Blood Simple' was an ambitious undertaking, even if it wasn't, in my view, wholly successful. The story is exciting enough, but riddled with stupid moments, the most glaring example being a dead man  who has been motionless with a copiously-bleeding gunshot wound for about an hour  suddenly coming to life and finding the energy to start crawling down the road. I'm all for unlikely scenarios, but this was a bit too outlandish for me to be able to suspend disbelief. However, 'Blood Simple's' greatest success lies in the fact that it gave two talented filmmakers  as well as cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, who made his major debut here  the experience they needed to work towards greater things. In any case, for another noir from the minds of the Coen brothers, look towards 'The Man Who Wasn't There (2001),' which I absolutely loved.",Blood Simple
50,mjneu59,a strong debut,8,7 November 2010,"Working with more cold nerve than hard cash the Coen brothers made their debut feature into a near perfect black comedy of errors, revolving around a murder plot gone wrong and a chain of madly logical circumstances which lead everyone involved into a false assumption about who did what to whom. Veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh steals the film playing the two-bit detective hired by a cuckolded husband to kill his wife; with his redneck drawl and stiff boot shuffle Walsh brings to life the hidden menace behind the Texan good-ol'-boy façade. The limitations of a shoestring budget (by Hollywood standards) is effectively camouflaged by a moody, exaggerated visual style, punctuated by moments of startling violence, and by a diabolical plot which, contrary to the title, is anything but simple. It's not a film for weak stomachs, but can still be a lot of fun if approached in the proper (perverse) frame of mind.",Blood Simple
51,st-shot,The Coen Brothers Dynamic Debut,8,27 March 2008,"Nick Ray's They Live by Night (49) and Terrence Malick's (73) Badlands come to mind when I attempt to recall stunning directorial first features as good as Blood Simple. Joel and Ethan Coen's Texas neo-noir has a textured grittiness that gets uglier and uglier as things begin to unravel for a group of unsavory and shortsighted desperate characters. Julian Marty suspects (correctly) that one of his club employees,Ray is sleeping with his wife Abby. He hires a PI by the name of Visser to kill them and make them disappear in a furnace out back of the club. Visser in turn double crosses Marty allowing Ray to turn the table on Julian. Visser for his own survival now tracks Ray and Abby.From it's opening shots of windshield wipers laboring under a rainy night to the light pouring through bullet holed walls in it's cynically bravura and suspenseful climax Blood Simple maintains a visually consistent, persuasive and unrelenting atmosphere of impending doom which ends badly for all involved. While there is plenty of dazzling imagery and camera movement that will become hallmarks in future Coen pictures the low key, dark mood of the story line remains intact as its cast of intelligence challenged players clumsily and brutally put their plans into practice. Relative unknowns John Getz (Ray) Francis McDormand (Abby) and Dan Hedaya (Marty) have a refreshing non-star, homey look, that gives the film a glamorless reality. W.Emmet Walsh's Visser oozes cynicism and greed. He is the films's conscience which like him has none. He's as grimy and unctuous a character as you will find in eighties film, a perfect compliment to the snake den setting he enters. Walsh pulls it off with sublime sleaziness.Blood Simple is one tough movie that never compromises it's caustic view of humanity behaving callous, cruel and downright dumb. It's an engrossing watch from start to finish and a clear indicator that the brothers Coen had the chops to challenge the best of their era. Through the end of the century they would more than fulfill this early promise.",Blood Simple
52,CubsandCulture,A effective debut,7,30 April 2021,It is interesting to see a lot of other Coen brothers' films in their debut. The final sequence of this film feels very much like some of the extended chases scenes from No Country for Old Men. The dialogue has the wit of say Fargo. The film has a perverse sense of justice that crops up time and again their work. This is worth checking out if you are a big fan of the Coens.On its own through the film is a bit rough. It is very clearly a first film; the pacing of story is off. The various twists of plot are a bit much-some of them are not properly set-up. The acting-surprisingly-was lackadaisical.,Blood Simple
53,MaxBorg89,The Coens' first great piece of cinema,10,16 July 2008,"As far as directorial debuts go, few are as ambitious and inventive as the Coen brothers' first film, Blood Simple, as it mixes genres and moods in a way that anticipated Tarantino's similar experiments by a decade, while still retaining an apparent simplicity, both narratively and formally, that few people originally saw as the beginning of one of American cinema's most extraordinary careers.Set in a stark Texas landscape, Blood Simple opens on a premise that seems to be borrowed from the likes of Double Indemnity or The Postman Always Rings Twice: someone steals another man's wife. However, the two adulterous lovers (Jamie Getz and Frances McDormand) do not plan to assassinate the betrayed husband (Dan Hedaya). On the contrary, he hires a sleazy PI (M. Emmett Walsh) to spy on them to carry out some twisted plan of his own. That is, until the investigator goes rogue and the situation escalates in the most grotesque of ways.This escalation is matched by the Coens' constant shifts between genres, achieved through lighting, music and camera movements. Noir, straightforward thriller, horror, black comedy: Blood Simple is each of these and all of them at once, but the transition is never forced or unnatural; in fact, these transitions occur because somehow the story itself demands that they happen. In a way, this is a film that is aware of its own fictitious nature and toys with it as much as possible - because it can. This has since become a trademark of the two brothers, and it is as fresh and original now as it was back in 1984.The same can be said of the four main actors: Getz and McDormand (soon to be Mrs. Joel Coen) form a solid leading couple, thoroughly menaced by the sudden ferocity of Hedaya, then best known for playing Rhea Perlman's dim-witted ex-husband on Cheers (an image he gladly, and expertly, reverses here). And then there's Walsh, who takes his practically identical role in Blade Runner and increases the character's unlikability, turning in one of the most brutally charming villainous performances of the '80s (and of the Coen canon).Joel and Ethan Coen had a very clear idea of what they wanted to achieve in the movie business from the get-go, and Blood Simple is one of the best examples of this: for 90 minutes, it takes you to a whole new world, one that most people are happy to revisit as often as they can.",Blood Simple

56,barnabyrudge,"Startlingly good debut from the Coen Brothers - twisted, enthralling and ingenious.",9,6 August 2014,"There are two versions of the Coen Brothers' debut film Blood Simple – the theatrical print, plus a director's cut version which, curiously enough, is several minutes SHORTER than the other version. The Coens' director's cut is tightened up in terms of editing and includes a few sections of altered soundtrack - but in truth, they haven't improved what was already a very fine movie thankfully they haven't worsened it either. And in either of its editions – whether it be the longer theatrical cut or the director's cut - it is still a film which oozes class.Seedy Texan bar owner Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya, never better) is convinced that his pretty young wife Abby (Frances McDormand) is having an affair. He hires sleazy private dick Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to find out if he's right and, sure enough, Visser soon discovers Abby spending a night of passion in a roadside motel with one of Marty's bartenders, Ray (John Getz). Visser even gets a number of photographs of the lovers in compromising positions, just to prove what he has discovered. Later, burning with jealousy and hatred, Marty offers Visser $10,000 if he will kill the adulterous lovers. It is here where Blood Simple suddenly stops being a standard thriller about treachery and murder, and steps into a wickedly warped world of its own. To say more about the plot would be to give away some of the most cunning and well- crafted twists seen at the movies in many a long year. Let it be sufficient to say that every character finds themselves progressively sinking deeper into their own web of scheming and counter-scheming. Double crosses take place; murdered people turn out to be still alive; erroneous assumptions are made about who is out to harm who. What makes Blood Simple so fascinating is the way it tangles cause and consequence with such ingenuity, creating a plot that is at once cunningly complicated yet simple to understand. A number of actors give career-best performances, notably Hedaya, Getz and Walsh. The latter especially is brilliantly memorable as the slimy, unscrupulous, maniacally giggling private eye whose moral compass is about as far off- centre as it's possible to get. McDormand is excellent too, as the main female character, who may – according to various moments of deliberate story disorientation – be either a femme fatale or an innocent victim of circumstance. Carter Burwell's evocative score adds to the atmosphere, while Barry Sonnenfeld provides fabulous cinematography (several years before becoming a director himself, of such titles as Men In Black and Get Shorty). The dialogue crackles thanks to the Coens' wonderful script, with Joel himself taking the lone directing duties and turning in a masterclass of suspense and unpredictability. The only flaw – an extremely minor one at that – is the inclusion of a couple of thriller clichés. Most prominent among these is the way these films always seem to feel compelled to incorporate a 'shock' nightmare sequence and Blood Simple is no different, injecting a not-very-necessary scene towards the end where a dead character turns up in a dream to spook one of the others. Otherwise, the film skilfully avoids clichés, emerging a supremely absorbing, well-made and confident debut from two men who have spent the thirty years since giving us one brilliant film after another. If someone, somewhere, told the Coens to ""start as you mean to go on"", they certainly did just that, hitting the heights at the first time of asking with this quite wonderful little thriller.",Blood Simple

Aware of the tryst, Julian hires a private investigator (M. Emmet Walsh) who eventually becomes Julian's hitman. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned.The now-infamous Coen brothers' first feature film, ""Blood Simple"" is a twisty and narratively straightforward neo-noir that wears on the nerves as it lurches along. The film is, in some ways, predictable, though there is a constant sense that things are going to go off the rails at any moment. You have all the elements of a typical crime epic or film noir: An affair, a hitman, and a jealous husband--but they are stripped down here to their bare essences, and the result is a surprisingly potent vision.What is perhaps most ingenious about ""Blood Simple"" is that it takes copious advantage of character perspective, which allows for many of the scenarios to have a larger-than-life feel. What the characters don't know is as important as what they do know, and the film does the bulk of its storytelling with images and moments that are loaded with meaning even without a word being spoken. In order for this kind of storytelling to work, you need two things: apt direction and good actors. Fortunately, ""Blood Simple"" has both. Jon Getz plays the downtrodden everyman to the hilt, while Frances McDormand is appropriately doe-eyed as his impervious lover. Dan Hedaya and M. Emmet Walsh portray the ostensible villains, though the morals of all involved are real turned on their heads.The film ramps up to its climax in the last twenty minutes or so, and, true to form, again manages to take a simple set-up and expand it into something grand and almost theatrical. And yet, in every instance in which it does this, ""Blood Simple"" never manages to err on the side of pretentiousness or self-congratulatory artiness. In a true Texas spirit, ""Blood Simple"" manages to stay down-to-earth, even when it's not. 9/10.",Blood Simple

Ray (John Getz), one of Marty's employees, is having an affair with Abby. Marty, in retaliation, hires a private investigator (the brilliant M. Emmet Walsh, who's not as stupid as he initially seems) to first follow, then murder, the adulterous pair.That's the setup of ""Blood Simple,"" and what follows is both suspenseful and sly, a literal 'comedy of errors' rife with unexpected humor, stomach-churning suspense, and several conflicting plot threads that are interwoven seamlessly at the climax.

61,Steffi_P,"""What I know about is Texas""",8,10 November 2011,"The 1980s were a decade of contrasts. On the one hand this was an era of fast-paced action movies and tear-jerking dramas, with a general mood of warmth and optimism not really seen since the 50s. And yet the independent movies of that time were among the bleakest and most amoral of any decade, as the trendy influences of film noir and art house (with a touch of exploitation violence) combined in the vision of the latest generation of upstarts. Blood Simple, the debut feature of celebrated writing and directing duo Joel and Ethan Coen, is a grim delving into the seedy underbelly of the world of neon signs and ten gallon hats.The brothers Coen here cultivate an appropriately stark visual style. The movie is almost entirely composed of close-ups and mid-shots, with the actors the only things in sharp focus, so the backgrounds all but disappear into a dull fuzz. Not only does this keep us entirely absorbed in what the characters are doing, it has a bizarre, disorientating effect upon the viewer.And that unsettling atmosphere spills over into the acting performances. In Blood Simple there is barely a smile or a laugh, save for M. Emmett Walsh's occasional guffaw at his own jokes. Walsh is exceptionally creepy, playing the archetypal corpulent southerner to the hilt. Frances McDormand gives a deliberately stripped-down, almost ghost-like performance, but with just enough presence to it that we believe her final acts of resourcefulness. Essentially, the Coens have encouraged slow, restrained turns from the cast which border upon the surreal.It all makes for tough viewing, but it's the kind of tough viewing it's worth making the effort for. Each scene may be painstakingly slow, but the whole thing is nicely brief (the screenplay was probably about six pages), and finished with a beautifully haunting piano score (that sounds vaguely like Simply Red's ""Stars"", but not quite enough to spoil it) those clever Coens have created a simple yet effective nightmare thriller.",Blood Simple
62,a_chinn,Film debut of the Coen Brothers is a neo-noir masterpiece,10,16 August 2021,"The Coen Brother's debut film is still a knockout today. For their first film, they made a dark, moody modern film noir with a classic set up. John Getz steps out with his boss' wife, Frances McDormand. Dan Hedaya plays the cuckolded husband who suspects something is up, so he hires a private detective, the great M. Emmet Walsh (""Blade Runner"" ""Raising Arizona"" ""The Jerk""), to check up on his wife. To reveal more would spoil the fun, but if you've read any James M. Cain, you probably know where the plot is headed. While the story is strong, like most Coen Brothers' films, it's the visuals that make the film so memorable, filled with images that burn themselves into your memory (the close up of Hadaya's broken finger, headlights on a lonely highway, a moving pile of dirt, and the light shaft through bullet holes in a wall, which I believe this film did first). Barry Sonnenfeld did the photography on the film, as well as the next two Coen Brother films (""Raising Arizona"" and ""Miller's Crossing"") and his mark is unmistakable. When Sonnenfeld quit cinematography to produce and direct his own film, such as ""Men in Black"" and ""The Addams Family,"" the Coens managed to find some other very talented replacements, but Sonnenfeld left a unique mark on the films he did with the Coens. Actually, Sonnenfeld left his mark on all of the films he worked as cinematographer, which was only nine feature films in total (""Compromising Positions"" ""Three O'Clock Hight"" ""Throw Momma from the Train"" ""Big"" ""When Harry Met Sally..."" and ""Misery""). But back to ""Blood Simple,"" this film is an incredibly tight and suspenseful thriller. The finale, is something of a precursor to type of brutality you'd find in the violent crime films of the 90s, ALA ""Shallow Grave"" or Tarantino. A must see for fans of classic film noir or fans of the Coen Brothers who may have missed this early effort. FUN FACT! On the MGM DVD and blu-ray editions (not the Criterion editions) there is a commentary track by film historian Kenneth Loring, who is in fact an actor reading a completely fake commentary that was written by Joel and Ethan Coen. Some of his ""facts"" include that Marty's dog was animatronic and that one driving scene was acted out in reverse as well as upside down.",Blood Simple
63,onepotato2,hilarious. astounding.,9,6 January 2003,"Ugh. So much griping about what this movie isn't! ""It's not a good thriller"" ""It's not suspenseful"" ""I like Fargo better"" Bring your genre recognition and creative constraints to movies whose scripts never passed through a working brain. There are plenty to choose from.Thriller? mystery? love triangle..? Who cares? This is simply a good film. I don't care if I can tell you what genre it is. If you like passive viewing this isn't for you. When you kvetch about B.S., all it does is indicate you were a late-comer to the Coens and saw them in non-chronological order after seeing Fargo. I'm so sorry for you.Boring performances? Not in my opinion. I'm relieved (delighted!) that it's not an ""actors"" movie with people method-ing up the plot. And I certainly don't watch it to vicariously feel anyones emotions. Pricey & needy name actors would have ruined this movie. (As in Ladykillers) Who cares if they're subdued? It's not about the perfs, it's about the thought you as a viewer bring to it. This is a ""post-Method"" movie and it's extremely clever and deep.Plot too intricate? It's less complex than it appears, and much easier to understand than some piece of convoluted tripe like Mission Impossible. SPOILER: The double-cross begins in mid-conversation in M. Emmett Walsh's VW bug.For me, the pacing is perfect. Any ten minutes of this movie is more thoughtful than plenty of other movies with frantic activity trying to hide their facile nature (Minority Report, O Brother, etc. etc. ad nauseum.) And I do not enjoy any of the fussy, formulaic follow-ups the Coens made after this. The joy of this movie is watching characters 'complete the picture' incorrectly, and then take action in a way that will be painfully consistent with their assumptions. The movie paints the world as a chilly machine with parts set in motion by human idiocy, and implicates a God indifferent to all manner of human suffering. All of which should sound familiar to anyone who's read Mark Twain's The Mysterious Stranger.The spare conceits of this movie are perfectly scaled. It has a minimalist score with some very nice music cues; and three or four sweet camera tricks so quietly inserted that you might miss them, which make me smile.",Blood Simple
64,framptonhollis,one of the most intense and inventive thrillers i have ever seen,9,1 January 2017,"Joel and Ethan Coen seem as if they can do no wrong (I will admit that I have not seen ""The Ladykillers"" or ""Intolerable Cruelty"", but lets forget those critically panned least-favorites for now), even their earliest feature film is one of the most beautifully made, well scripted, and brilliantly structured movies I have ever seen! It's so unbelievably amazing that I have the urge to rewatch this masterpiece right now! It is seriously a genius work of cinema that combines the absurd with the shocking-a tour de force of thrills, chills, and, occasionally, laughs. It is quite important to mention the Coens' dark sense of humor and how it creeps into this film ever now and then. It may not always be present, but it is always possible that it will jump out and tickle the viewer at any moment.Practically ever single filmmaking aspect is done to sheer perfection. The characters are very interesting, even if they are rarely likable, and they are performed with perfection and intensity. The cinematography and haunting soundtrack also perfect the film on a technical level, and the screenplay and structure form an unpredictable and inventive masterpiece of the crime thriller.",Blood Simple
65,nycritic,The Inflexible Law of Irony,10,21 November 2006,"Film-noir would have a blast had the Coen brothers been alive and directing throughout its golden years. Their debut film BLOOD SIMPLE is an exercise not only in people caught in their own traps, but about people armed with a limited knowledge of a situation that is forming around them, and acting accordingly, with truly devastating results. The brilliance of letting us in on what we know, and having the characters act only as to what they know of each other and what they ignore about the other gives it an edge that not many noir movies -- even many classics -- have.We always expect the hero to somehow uncover the ugliness of a situation. We always expect that the woman will be a double or triple crossing femme fatale capable of stopping at nothing to get what she wants. We always assume the cuckolded husband will get his revenge, even if it costs him his own morality. And we always, always assume that the people who are meant to be caught will be.The Coen brothers' BLOOD SIMPLE takes all of the elements of noir and places it neatly on its head while retaining a lush style flooded in ambiance and a tightening noose. True, there is a pair of cheating lovers and an angry husband who suspects as much. His uncovering of the truth leads to his shocking decision of having them killed by the private investigator he's hired to follow them -- with no bodies left behind. What follows, of course, has to be seen to be believed, and frankly, it makes perfect sense even when doing a re-take. Because of what I mentioned -- what the characters know, what they ignore, and what decisions they make, is completely outside plot demands. Such a thing becomes screamingly evident in the movie's final showdown, where the last two people you'd ever expect to make it find themselves pitted against each other, fighting for survival, and the other's obliteration.All of the actors are at their element in this great movie. Dan Hedaya, while playing a man capable of paying a man to get his wife killed, manages to be someone you feel sorry for. John Getz moves effortlessly from romantic lover to someone sick of the horror he's walked into. M. Emmett Walsh runs away with the entire movie in his portrayal of greed personified. And Frances McDormand has a powerful impression as the woman in the middle of these three angry men.",Blood Simple

Their debut is no exception. It's basically a tarted up slasher movie, full of semi-dipsh!t characters who walk around making bad decision after bad decision.

67,PredragReviews,"""I Didn't Do Anything Funny""",8,1 June 2016,"The story is awfully simple: Marty, a Texas bar owner and betrayed husband (Dan ""Usual Suspects"" Hedaya) hires the private eye to kill his unfaithful wife Abby (Frances McDormand) and her lover Ray (John ""The Fly"" Getz) who's also Marty's employee. The eye pretends to do the job and shows Marty some fake photographs showing the lovers shot dead in bed. He takes the money, then he shoots his hirer right away and disappears. Ray, who doesn't know about the detective's existence, discovers Marty's almost dead body. For him, no doubt: it's Abby who did this work... He takes him away in order to bury him far away from the bar, and finds out that Marty isn't dead yet. He's forced to bury him alive, offering us the most nightmarish scene of the film....The movie is a real visual and sound shock. The script is incredibly original and brings some freshness in usual cinema stuff dealing with unfaithful characters ready to kill each other in order to avoid all the difficulties linked to divorce. The ambiance and atmosphere is the ones of a real bad dream, a nightmare, and the fact that the story takes place in an early, gray place in Texas (don't miss the hilarious prologue), where everything weird can happen very normally, adds to it. And the soundtrack by Carter Burwell is extraordinary, this is what he did first and best for the Coen brothers. It captures everything of the movie and makes the nightmare become really true. All in all, ""Blood Simple"" is a very intriguing and suspenseful film, and totally entertaining. Highly recommended for a cold rainy night.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Blood Simple
68,Matt_Layden,The Coen's Always Have The Last Laugh.,7,20 May 2010,"A man hires a Private Investigator to follow his wife, whom he assumes is having an affair with one of his employees. He's right and he goes a little berserk. He wants the Private Investigator to kill them and will pay him $10,000. But nothing is that simple. The Coen's first feature film is something to marvel at. They shot the trailer and used that to interest investors, claiming this is what the film will look like, only 90 minutes long. With the help of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, they got what they wanted. Blood Simple. with a period after the title like it should be spelled, is a modern noir film that has that signature Coen style ending that gets the audience pondering it's meaning, even if it's just a joke from the directors.Blood Simple starts off slow, really slow. I found myself having no interest in the film until the Private Investigator pulled his stunt on Marty. The film then took an interesting turn into a suspenseful film that actually got me excited for what would happen next. The events that happen after the slow, boring and uninteresting beginning make up for it. Maybe upon repeated viewings I'll like the opening scenes more, but I just found them long and drawn out.M. Emmet Walsh stands out above the rest of the cast, he looks like he is having the most fun and it suits his character. Hedaya plays his usual prick self and there is a young Frances McDormand who plays his cheating wife. John Getz as Ray is sometimes frustrating, from the look of his career now, others find him lacking as well. He is not leading material. Blood Simple is a well done directorial debut from the brothers who've become some of the best working directors today. As it stands in their filmography, it's obvious they've outdone Blood Simple. Yet it still has a place in their books, since it was their first effort and it is better than the likes of the more Hollywood budgeted films like The Ladykillers or Intolerable Cruelty. The Coen's have always been doing their own thing, you can tell from this film. They don't cater to the audience, instead they play on their expectations. Simply put, Blood Simple is good, but not great.",Blood Simple
69,JuguAbraham,Movie to make you laugh (and reflect on why you laughed),7,23 August 2005,"Debut films have a quality that experience smothers. What struck me first was the disarming innocence of a clever script--not a single cop surfaces in the film with so many killings, an Alsation makes its presence felt early in the film but disappears soon after, and a dead man (no proof that he did die, of course!) narrates the prologue of the movie. A fresh towel laid out on a car seat lets blood stain it with ferocious osmotic quality as though the towel was covering a fresh wound! But the blood is several hours old. Yet the movie is clever enough to make you think you are cleverer than those you are watching, because the directors let you the viewer know more than the characters themselves.The Coen brothers are very clever. I thought ""O brother, where art thou"" to be average fare until I realized that it was based on Homer's ""Odyssey,"" which the Coen brothers deny having read. But neither have I read Homer in original but even without reading Homer a somewhat literate individual can see the obvious parallels. When you realize what they have done you do not hate the Coens but you begin to admire their ingenuity--their scripts reduce the Greek heroes to mortal escaped prisoners or simple anti-heroes.In ""Blood Simple,"" blood that suddenly oozes from a nostril lets the viewer know more than the characters in the film. The comedy of errors that weave the film, invites the viewer to laugh at the dumb actions of each character. But then none of the characters know what the viewer knows and appear dumber than the average person.The Coens have mastered this gift of portraying the average man or woman, simple or crooked, placed within a spartan canvas of knee-jerk emotions. You laugh. You cry. You go through catharsis. The Greeks have taught the Coens the grammar of entertainment.Robust performances, striking camera-work (""L.A. Confidential"" picked up several clues from this film), and interesting dialogs invite you to leave your brain behind as you laugh at ""stupid"" characters on the screen. You enjoy the film until you reflect on why you enjoyed the film.",Blood Simple
70,philip_vanderveken,One of the best debuts that I've ever seen,7,20 July 2005,"Ever since I've seen ""Fargo"", I've decided that I will try to watch all movies from the Coen brothers. So far I've already seen three and I must say that those guys have some excellent talents for writing and directing a movie. But there isn't one writer or director who has never made an error in his career and too often a debut isn't the best example of what someone has to offer in the future. That's why I started to watch this movie with a double feeling: Would it be as good as the others, or would it be a rather typical, perhaps even conservative debut? Abby is married to Marty, a bar owner in a small Texan town, but she is also having an affair with one of her husbands employees, the barman called Ray. Marty suspects something and hires Loren Visser - a private detective - to spy on them and eventually to kill them. But there is one problem. Visser has his own plans to get Marty's money. And when Marty and Visser start double crossing each other and when Ray and Abby don't feel like they can trust each other, things quickly get out of control...If you've seen other Coen movies, then you know pretty well what to expect from this one. As always the quality of the script is very good and the several plot twists only make the story more intriguing, without making it unbelievable. What you'll see in this movie is that you know exactly what is going on with the characters, even though they do not, but that you'll keep guessing what their next move will be. But not only the story is good, so is the camera work. It's perhaps not always as self-assured as you see in their later movies, but you can clearly see that the men already had some good ideas of how the imaging in a movie should look like.All in all this may perhaps not be their best movie, but it sure is one of the best debuts that I've ever seen. The only thing that I don't really understand is why they call this movie a horror movie. This is a thriller, and a fine one too, but horror isn't exactly the best qualification for this movie. The movie breathes the typical Coen atmosphere which so many of us like and that's why I believe that this movie is definitely worth a watch. I give it a 7.5/10.",Blood Simple
71,bkrauser-81-311064,A Suspenseful Thriller,8,12 April 2016,"Patton Oswalt once came up with the best analogy when describing the viewing of a Coen Brothers movie. ""Most films, you're watching through a pin door and there's a guy there so say, 'here we go,' but in their movies, it's like big hanger doors open up and everyone is working and you choose to walk in. No one's there to help you."" Having seen the lions share of their movies, I can tell you not only is this analogy accurate but probably helps explain why their films are so fervidly accepted by filmophiles while receiving a collective shrug by mass audiences.Blood Simple. is arguably the Coens at their least Coen-esque, telling a straightforward narrative about a jealous husband seeking revenge on his wife and her lover. Yet even without the brothers trademark sloppiness Blood Simple. is nevertheless a brilliant film; a tale told with economy and an excess of blood-cuddling suspense. If done by any other director, this sordid little film would be a highlight in an accomplished career. Yet for the Coen Brothers this movie is simply a warm-up.Dan Hedaya stars as Julian, a scrupulous and miserly bar owner who finds his relationship with the flighty Abby (McDormand) falling apart. She is embraced in the cowboy arms of Ray (Getz) who works at the bar and feels elated by the sudden attention. Meanwhile Julian hires private eye Loren Visser (Walsh) to spy then ultimately kill the two love birds in their boudoir. Shot with obvious affection for Alfred Hitchcock and to a lesser extent, noir, Blood Simple. is an austere, chilling and darkly humorous take on the old adage ""The plans of mice and men oft go astray.""What's present from the siblings more well-known movies is the deep reverence towards the characters. At no point did any plot-line feel contrived and necessarily and each actor had their moment to shine and even thrive which is a miracle given how small the production was. The Coens famously went door-to-door showing potential investors a trailer for the film in a gambit to raise $750,000 for the production. Instead of enticing audiences with large names, Joel Coen casted future wife and relative unknown Frances McDormand as the Bambi-esque Abby. The relative anonymity of the actors only further accentuate the suspense and endears the characters, their psychology and their situations, enveloping you into the tale of a West Texas melodrama.What isn't present are the large, at times ecumenical themes that dominate the Coens' films, highlighted with a sloppiness that mimics life itself. Instead of the film being breathtakingly vast, it's small, claustrophobic and narratively tight. Instead of a massive two hour symphony, the brothers made an unassuming little chamber fugue which nevertheless does it's job and does it well. The brothers would get a chance to further hone their comedic chops in their next film Raising Arizona (1987) thus learning how to do the cinematic walk. Then they ran years later, blowing the doors off of the movie world with a mighty array of masterpieces including Best Picture winner No Country for Old Men (2007). It is this writers opinion that the Coens simply can't make a bad movie. They can made disappointing features (cough cough The Ladykillers (2004)), but not bad movies.Blood Simple. is not an exception to that rule but more an example of the road not taken. If the Coens consistently took the easy route and made films for the purpose of base entertainment, no doubt they would still be immensely successful and still be critically acclaimed. They took the road less taken and sharpened their skills like swords on a wet stone to tell tales beyond tales. Blood Simple. is fierce, suspenseful, tightly-wound and wonderfully shot. It's a competently made feature told by two sages who were on the cusp of greatness. In short, it's a d*** good movie.",Blood Simple
72,Luigi Di Pilla,Simply Average Thriller,5,17 July 2004,"Blood Simple could have been a much more intelligent thriller but it lets open some questions at the end. The characters aren´t developed enough because sometimes you could think hey man, why is he so silly and so on. Perhaps the story goes not too deep in the crime elements and I´ve got the impression that there were some unnecessary scenes to extend the movie. This one works no doubt for fans who like creepy movies à la FARGO. The story is a little bit weak as I already mentioned above but for a thriller from 1984 it is okay. For these reasons I give with my wife: 5/10. My wife didn´t like it.",Blood Simple
73,arungeorge13,A cracker of a debut for the Coens! [+71%],7,29 May 2020,"The Coen brothers, in their debut feature, smartly use blood as both a storytelling and stylistic device. The screenplay is soaked in blood from start to finish, and the four major characters - the husband (a menacing bar owner), the wife (who's cheating), the employee (who the wife's with), and the private investigator (with sinister intentions) - are deeply connected by it. This is neo-noir fiction at its finest, told at an unhurried pace even though the film's run-time is a crisp 95 minutes.Blood Simple is an early sign of what the Coens continued to achieve in their later films. It's grisly, wacky, and unexpected. M Emmet Walsh is a revelation as (PI) Visser and his repulsive laugh, unforgettable. Frances McDormand plays the role of the flawed, believable wife with consummate ease. The sound design and editing are also worthy of praise. I truly felt the jolt of the fly-zapper in that intense confrontation scene between the husband and his wife's lover. Same goes for the shot where the newspaper thumps against the front door, seemingly out of nowhere.The writer-director duo also lend the film a bit of a mystic feel, with a man who's supposedly ""shot dead"" crawling back to life momentarily. The almost 15-minute long inhumation scene doesn't have a single dialogue but is wildly effective. I should have paid more attention to that opening voiceover. This tale of homicidal lovers is certainly here to stay!",Blood Simple

Get it at Amazon.)Joel and Ethan Coen made their cinematic debut in this well-plotted, diabolical thriller about a Texas saloon owner (Marty, played by Dan Hedaya) who hires a morally deranged private eye (M. Emmet Walsh) to murder his two-timing wife (Abby, played by Joel Coen's significant other, Frances McDormand) and her lover (Ray, played by John Getz).This is one of those movies that looks good as you're watching it; it's even amazing how it all fits together; but later you look back and see how contrived it was. Everything is set up a little too well, with the viewer aware of so many things the characters are not, for example where the Zippo lighter is and how many bullets are left in the revolver and how the gun got to be where it is. That's the sort of thing good writers are supposed to do: start, or at least place themselves, at the end and then work backward. Problem is, you can get too cute, and that's what happens to Coen and Coen here. If everything is too pat and works too well, the viewer is left with a sinking feeling of being hustled by contrivance.McDormand, lately seen in as the homespun pregnant police chief in Fargo (1996) also directed by Coen, does a good job here of looking like a cheap and easy woman with strong survival instincts. Getz seems just about as stupid as his character needs to be. (His attempted cover-up of the murder was worthy of an appearance on ""America's Dumbest Criminals."") Hedaya as the sleazy saloon keep is particularly slimy, and M. Emmet Walsh in his VW beetle with the doll with lighted boobs hanging from the rear view mirror is fully degenerate in that old Southern style.Some annoyances: Why do Abby and Ray sleep and mate with the blinds up so the P.I. can conveniently photograph them? Did I lose track of the number of bullets left in the revolver or was there a gap in their placement, and even if there really was one left at the end why doesn't Abby wait until she can see him to shoot, and how come she doesn't check to see if the gun is loaded? And how come the window is about four inches open, instead of closed or open more, after Abby climbs out the bathroom window into it; and how come Walsh is feeling around in the window? Is he using his hand as bait?",Blood Simple
75,sme_no_densetsu,A memorable debut for the Coen brothers,8,27 February 2017,"""Blood Simple"" marked the first directorial effort of the Coen brothers. As is normally the case, the brothers also co-authored the script. Even at this early stage in their careers, you can see many of the hallmarks that later made modern classics out of films like ""Fargo"" & ""No Country For Old Men"".The story harks back to the film noir and hard-boiled detective stories of the 1940's. A love triangle is poised to turn deadly when a jealous husband hires a private investigator to 'dispose' of his rival. Naturally, when blood is involved, things don't turn out to be quite so simple.The plot follows a characteristically serpentine path, prefiguring similarly convoluted plots in movies like ""Miller's Crossing"" & ""The Big Lebowski"". While the dialogue may not have quite the polish of these later efforts, there is nevertheless a distinctive flair to the script.Bringing this script to life is a cast that's decent but unexceptional. Dan Hedaya & M. Emmet Walsh are always worth watching but John Getz is a bit of a weak link. Frances McDormand made her film debut here as the requisite femme fatale, albeit an unconventional one. It's a pretty good performance but not one that ranks alongside her best.From a visual standpoint, the movie has several interesting touches sprinkled throughout. However, as with the script, the direction pales just a little in comparison to the Coens' subsequent work. In the music department, apart from a couple of intriguing soundtrack selections the music is mostly unremarkable.While not a first tier Coen brothers effort, ""Blood Simple"" contains enough of their signature ingredients to make it worthwhile for fans of theirs or just lovers of crime dramas in general.

77,Screen_Blitz,Thoroughly unpredictable and captivating in nearly every turn,8,1 May 2016,"Joel and Ethan Coen are the names of the most acclaimed films in modern cinema, particularly in their 1996 film 'Fargo' which placed this directorial duo deep in the cinematic spotlight. These directors adopted a unique style of filmmaking involving genre-busting punctuated with dark humor and captivating characters. The legacy of these filmmakers' brilliant minds dates back to the mid-1980s in this expectation-defying thriller that started it all. Blood Simple stars Dan Hedeya as Julian Marty, a disgruntled Texas bar owner who learns his wife Abby (played by frequent Coen brothers collaborator Frances McDormand) having an affair one of his fellow bartenders Ray (played by John Getz) to escape from their abusive relationship. Hatching a plan of vengeance, Marty hires a private detective Loren Visser (played by M. Emmett Walsh) who secretly photographs their affairs, to murder them and dispose of their bodies. When Ray and Abby discover his plan, they make a desperate effort to escape together in Houston. But when a murder unexpectedly occurs, things grow increasingly complicated when everyone reveals to have a devious plan of their own leading to a turbulent chain of double-crossing and bloodshed. This film marks the directorial of the Coen brothers.Contrary to the film's title, things get anything but simple in this vastly unpredictable thriller and pulls plenty of twists and turns when you least expect them. In nearly scene, the characters engage in simple situations to hatch their plans that seem likely succeed but are often foiled by unforeseen occurrences that are nearly impossible to predict. Many of these elements treat viewers with shock and pure irony powerful enough to leave viewers confused at first but later make sense when it all comes down to he boiling point. And it is worth mentioning things do get pretty violent and result in blood baths, and this film's dreadful and suspense-driven tone rarely lets the viewers rest easy. At the same time, the character, solidly written and developed, provide small pinches of dark humor that cuts slight weight on the grim atmosphere, an element the Coen brothers are frequently known for. The slow pacing may bother some but when it reaches its outstanding climax it comes a shocking and well worth experience. Frances McDormand puts on a strong and memorable performance, though maybe not as memorable as the diligence she gave in her role in a later film Fargo. John Getz is also quite enticing in his role, demonstrating a sense of humanity as the other actors Dan Hedeya and M. Emmett Walsh who also put forth a ambitious effort. Blood Simple is an unpredictable and captivating thriller that shines as an engrossing directorial debut by the Coen brothers. This movie is an enticing piece of work that defies viewers' expectations from nearly every turn. While it may not be what I consider one of the best or necessarily my favorite work by the Coen brothers, it's one I believe most, if not all Coen brothers fan would come to appreciate.",Blood Simple
78,punishmentpark,"""...I can always crawl around without it...""",10,13 May 2015,"After having seen 'season one' of 'Fargo' (2014) twice, I felt the urge to see all the Coen brothers films again in chronological order.The first time I watched 'Blood simple.' was a few years after 'Fargo' (1996), one of the few films I must have seen more than twenty times. I still don't understand why, but I didn't even get passed the first ten or so minutes of 'Blood...' that first time. Years later I recorded it from Belgian TV, and I was hooked - and watched it on VHS over twenty times as well.'Blood simple.' is a tense, almost supernatural (dreams, coincidences) thriller, where all elements - dialogues, acting, soundtrack, cinematography, directing, you name it - come together perfectly (ánd are all perfect in their own right). This time, I forgot to check how the script worked out with the gas lighter, but from last time I remember it was solid enough; Visser wanted his lighter back and in the dark room he may have used matches, and when he wanted to light his cigarette he may have wanted to use his lighter as sort of a ritual. The plot is wonderfully constructed, with 'regular folks' becoming deeper, and mostly fatally, involved in a relatively simple plan to make some money.The element of dreams and coincidences getting the better of common sense and rationality is particularly well done. This is a post-film noir of the highest order in my book, plain and... simple.A big 10 out of 10.",Blood Simple
79,pyrocitor,"""What I know about is Texas, and down here, you're on your own""",10,16 January 2009,"To cite a single film as changing the course of cinema would likely be an overly lofty claim, but perhaps citing a pair of filmmakers at least putting an intriguing, fresh new spin on it would be a more feasible statement. With the period of independent film-making breaching the American mainstream having mainly tapered out by the early 1980s, the arrival of a director/producer/co-writing duo of brothers named Joel and Ethan Coen and their unassuming film debut shook up cinemas worldwide, offering a frank pastiche of classic genres and an intriguing blend of dark humour, quirky oddities and visceral realism. As such, Blood Simple was born, heralding a stunning debut for a pair of fierce new talents working with the silver screen. Demonstrating a deftness of cinematic touch right from the start, the Coen brothers dole out their story slowly and painstakingly, but so gripping and utterly engrossing is the story being told that never once does it lose the viewer to monotony. Far from it, as, while the story may appear on the surface a deceptively simple tale of adultery and murderous intentions, each ensuing plot point unfolds more and more intricate unexpected nuances, making the plot increasingly complex and morbidly riveting throughout. Most intriguing is the Coens' toying with point of view and knowledge of the events unfolding throughout - often the audience is privy to information the characters in the film solely lack, making the film all the more frustratingly gripping, but frequently the viewer is kept uncertain not only as to what will happen next, but also regarding what has already transpired. It is not until the very end of the film that the entire scope of events which have come to play becomes clear, not only making sense of what has transpired before but making it all the more draining and infuriating. Even more uncertain yet is who, if anyone, the sympathies of the audience show lie with, as the collection of thoroughly morally questionable characters on display demonstrate an exquisite exercise in flawed characterisation, and are all the more brutally credible for it. The film foreshadows the twisted genius the brothers would continue to develop in later films, finding quiet beauty in the most macabre of source material. Blood Simple proves aptly titled, as the film demonstrates a lurid fascination with blood throughout, constantly showing it seeping through materials, dripping and being smeared over surfaces throughout, somehow finding perverse aesthetic elegance in the gruesome aftermath of poor decisions. The Coens also demonstrate a recurring tradition of borrowing from the most selective of source materials: mainly classic film noir such as The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity, but also carrying shades of Hitchcock throughout, from the convoluted exploration of crimes of passion gone horribly wrong to even holding true to his timeless maxim of ""filming murder scenes like love scenes"", with one character even going so far as to rhythmically grunt in an unmistakably sexual manner while committing a murder and lighting a cigarette afterwards. In Blood Simple, love and death are continually intertwined, and the overlap between the two makes it increasingly difficult to differentiate. Yet despite discernible influences, the Coen brothers manage to create a hybrid which is essentially unique, alternating from pitch black humour to draining, uncomfortably tense segments and milking the claustrophobic, sweltering heat from shadowy Texas for all it is worth, crafting a neo-noir for the ages.The film also proves a definitive example of masterful technical film-making, from the exquisite cinematography of Barry Sonnenfeld, a sweeping array of high angles seen through softly rotating ceiling fans and jarring abrupt close ups to the simply wonderful use of sound, silence being used almost as a physical blow and soft background noise, from knocking on a door to dripping water creating more dread than any soaring orchestral score could ever hope to. However, the film's music rises to the challenge, also proves a defining component, with regular composer Carter Burwell contributing a chillingly unconventional yet hauntingly beautiful score, both amplifying the tension to almost unbearable levels and adding a single piano tragic wistfulness to the film's quieter moments. The Coen's noir influences also become clear through the lighting, a sumptuous blend of interior shadows and long, dark highways, with oncoming headlights appearing inevitable beacons of oncoming death.Similarly, few thrillers could boast such a uniformly superb cast, demonstrating superlative examples of morally ambiguous characters while injecting genuine emotion and frank realism to bring them to life. Frances McDormand gives a tremendous performance as a frustrated adulterous wife, seamlessly fading from luminously innocent to quietly sinister, never fully sealing the audience's sympathies but making them truly want to be with her every step of the way. John Getz powerfully makes the archetype of the 'stoically conflicted honest male led to horrifying actions through love of a woman' his own, adding a truly affecting raw vulnerability to his mostly silent hard man exterior. Dan Hedaya also proves a difficult character to reconcile as McDormand's husband - too selfishly vindictive to root for, yet too quietly honest to fully write off. And character actor M. Emmet Walsh, in arguably his strongest performance as a shady private detective is truly unforgettable, swapping throwaway humour for cold, visceral grimness in a heartbeat, and proving more outright terrifying than could ever have been expected. Samm-Art Williams also delivers a terrific performance as arguably the only wholly sympathetic character in the mix. The Coen's first and arguably strongest film is a viscerally wrenching, continually fascinating and utterly unmissable piece of cinema. Few films before or since have matched the cinematic gut punch of a debut of two unlikely auteurs that is Blood Simple, and no audiences, familiar with their work or not, should neglect seeing it. -10/10",Blood Simple
80,PimpinAinttEasy,Highly imagistic film with a sinister air .....,9,15 October 2015,"An enthralling and visually stunning film. Highly imagistic and full of all sorts of attention catching accouterments (like the fish, the lighter, the gun, the bar etc). The sound effects were something else altogether (eg. the scene where the newspaper hits the glass door). The sounds are used to create this dark, sinister and hypnotic air. I noticed that this film came out a couple of years before Blue Velvet. I'm sure Lynch was influenced by this film when he made The Lost Highway.My only issue was that it was overtly feminist. I mean all the male characters were supposed to be sneaky and stupid vermin while the cheating woman was portrayed as good-hearted.The amazing background score is used to great effect. There is one terrifying bit of music that sounds like a pack of dogs panting. It is used just before some act of violence is about to occur.(9/10)",Blood Simple
81,seymourblack-1,"Visual Flair, Quirky Characters & Offbeat Humour",9,16 April 2010,"The first offerings of most filmmakers provide an interesting indication of the directions in which their future output is likely to develop. ""Blood Simple"" on the other hand is an example of a fully realised entity which contains so many of the qualities and stylistic touches which are now synonymous with the Coen Brothers' entire body of work that it's evident just how clear a vision they had of what they wanted to achieve right from the very start. For their debut, they brought to the screen a stereotypical film noir which contained familiar ingredients and themes, such as murder, betrayal, corruption, deceit, double crosses and plot twists and added black humour, gruesome violence and some compellingly eccentric characters.The movie has a strong visual style which is produced by clever use of light, shadows and colour and also a variety of typical film noir camera angles. The disconcerting mood which this creates is also further enhanced by the predominantly laconic interactions between the characters and the fact that everyone in the movie is distrustful of everyone else. The screenplay is excellent and the amount of suspense and intrigue generated makes the story intense and very engaging throughout.Texas bar owner Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) harbours suspicions about his wife Abby (Frances McDormand) and hires seedy private detective Loren Visser (M.Emmet-Walsh) to follow her. When Visser's investigations reveal that Abby is having an affair with one of Marty's employees, a barman called Ray (John Getz), Marty responds by offering Visser $10,000 to kill the couple. The private detective subsequently doctors a photograph he'd taken of Abby and Ray together to give the appearance that they'd been killed and meets with Marty to collect his money. Marty accepts the photograph as authentic and duly pays Visser his fee. When the transaction is complete, Visser promptly shoots Marty in the chest and leaves the gun (which belongs to Abby) close by.The circumstances of Marty's murder lead to a sequence of misunderstandings and complications. Initially when Ray arrives at the crime scene and sees Abby's gun, he quickly deduces that she must've killed her husband and so he tries to cover up her crime. He moves the body which he intends to bury, into his car and drives down a highway but discovers that Marty (who had appeared to be dead) is still living. Ray goes ahead anyway and buries Marty alive.Later, when Ray tells Abby what he's done to protect her and she doesn't understand, he assumes that she's being deceitful and this impression is reinforced sometime afterwards when she takes a silent telephone call which he assumes is from another lover. When Abby goes to the bar to check on what Ray has told her, she gets the impression that he must've gone to see Marty and got involved in a fight over the amount of wages which were due to him.More serious trouble for the couple develops, however, when Visser realises that he's left a clue to his guilt at Marty's bar and sets about tying up all the loose ends. This involves the planned elimination of Abby and Ray and eventually brings the action to its gripping and very original climax.Ray's an extremely familiar type of noir character as he's an ordinary guy who's unwittingly drawn into a situation which he doesn't understand, where events go increasingly out of control and where he isn't able to do anything to prevent matters from getting even worse. John Getz is suitably unpretentious in this role and conveys his character's bewilderment and growing sense of anxiety with great skill. Frances McDormand is also wonderfully understated as the adulterous Abby who's similarly baffled by what happens and frequently misunderstands what's going on.Julian Marty is emotionally wounded, bitter and jealous and his powerful need for revenge drives him to seek the most violent and permanent solution possible. This is rather ironic considering his evident distaste for the course of action he's chosen and also the fact that he becomes physically sick on seeing Visser's photographs. Dan Hedaya portrays Marty's complex mixture of emotions very convincingly in a performance which contributes strongly to the success of the film.The stand out performance of the movie is provided by M.Emmet-Walsh who, as the sly, sweaty and totally unscrupulous private detective exudes a brand of wickedness which conveys forcibly the thoroughly despicable nature of his character. His complete lack of morality also makes him very comfortable in his own skin and this quality together with his often jovial demeanour make him particularly disturbing and fascinating. Emmet-Walsh's ability to capture the whole range of this villain's characteristics is extremely impressive and compelling.Considering its low budget and the Coen Brothers' lack of experience at the time when the film was made, ""Blood Simple"" is an extremely enjoyable and good quality movie.",Blood Simple

83,bobsgrock,"A sharp, eye-popping debut.",8,16 December 2009,"It is interesting to note that right now, there is perhaps no other American filmmaker able to create or willing to create such a unique and inventive style and characters as do the Coen Brothers. Joel and Ethan, those wildly creative brothers from Minnesota, started out simple enough, with just enough money and supplies to create the exact world they wanted. The result is Blood Simple, simply one of the most effective and well-made film noirs you will ever see.The plot is simple enough; a man and woman are having an affair and her husband wants them both dead. He hires an unsettling of a private detective, and just as it seems all will go smoothly and quietly, it all blows up. One of the great benefits of this film is the way in which the Coens wrote and edited each scene. Every single frame and scene add up and build upon each other to come to a huge climax; and there are several here.The acting is superb, restrained and totally under control by the actors. A young and stunning Frances McDormand, John Getz, and Dan Hedaya all lend their talents, but it is M. Emmet Walsh who commands all the attention as the mysterious and complex detective whose actions spark the fire about to go off.Mostly what Blood Simple does is establish a style and creative pattern so unique, it reminds you of a director like Hitchcock or Kubrick. What the Coens have in common with those great ones is that they know exactly what they want out of every department of the film. And they know exactly what is needed to entice and keep the grip of suspense on the audience. Little sounds and squeaks haunt the soundtrack, lights go on and off, and blood is spilled. It may have 'Simple' in the title, but look closer and this movie is anything but simple.",Blood Simple
84,baumer,Suffers from stupid characters,6,25 February 2002,"May contain some spoilers:While it is true that we all have to start somewhere, it is also true that we all get better with age and experience.  That may not be true for some of the greats ( Spielberg comes to mind, he was just brilliant from the beginning ) but for the Coen's, it is quite evident in their work.  My favourite Coen films are O Brother...., The Big Lebowski and Fargo.  These films appear to be the work of film makers that have developed their craft. Their is a maturity in the writing and a head first slide into the bizaare. And that is what has given the Coen's the reputation that follows them around now.  They are known as film makers that can give us something that we have never seen before.  If nothing else, when watching a Coen film, you know you're about to see something original.  The Coen's are pariahs of sorts but they are pariahs whom everyone wants to work with.  So give them credit for not being exactly like the next guy in Hollywood.  For the most part I enjoy Michael Bay films and Jerry Bruckheimer and some of the others that come along and make cookie cutter films, it is however refreshing to see film makers that have their own ideas and don't follow conventional paradigms.  The Coen's are their own creation and that is what makes them so revered.Now having said all that, let me just say that Blood Simple suffers from inexperience.  If you compare their latter films to this film made some 18 years ago, you will see a true progression in everything they do.  The writing is sharper, the characters are multi layered and the direction is a little more risky.  Blood Simple is an intriguing enough story, it's just that it suffers from characters that behave as though they are in a Saturday Night Live skit.  These are the type of characters that should be in a comedy that depends on people mistaking what's going on because no one talks to each other.  No one explains what they just did or what is happening, so they decide to act on what they think they know.  This kind of plot device was made famous in Three's Company.  For anyone who remembers that show, think of how many times someone was hiding in closet so they couldn't see what was taking place, all they could do was hear what was happening.  If you hear something without the benefit of the visual stimulus that goes with it, you can easily mistake someone taking out the garbage to someone having kinky sex.  This is what Blood Simple suffers from.  No one talks to each other here, and if they did, then perhaps there would be no movie and maybe that should tell you something right there.  To me, that means that the script needs some fine tuning.A fairly wealthy bar owner feels that his wife is having an affair with one of his bartenders.  He hires a private investigator to follow them.  When he gets the pictures proving his suspicions he gets to be little bit beyond reproach.  Not only is he hurt that his wife did this to him but he feels as though he was played for a fool.  So this being a Coen film, he has to do the worst possible thing imaginable.  He hires that same Private Dick to murder them.  One thing leads to another and now each member involved becomes entangled in a twisted imbroglio where no one seems innocent, except for maybe the wife that cheated on him in the first place.  She may have cheated but she sure doesn't want anyone dead, she just wants to get on with her life, without her husband.  Soon, people begin to turn up dead and everyone thinks the next person had something to do with it.  And this is where the film takes the wrong turn.  Instead of explaining what each of them did, like perhaps most normal people would do, everyone looks at each other like a deer caught in headlights.  This causes everyone to be left in the dark and wondering what just happened.  And this becomes frustrating because you want to shout at those involved.  You want to tell them to just open their mouths and tell each other what happened.  But instead of that we get the Three Company scenario and no one knows what the hell is going on.An example would be something like this:(Man returning from killing someone) It's done.(Woman he is talking to) What is?(Man) I don't feel to well, I don't know how you can ( he says this, thinking that she was the one that shot him in the first place).(Woman with slightly confused tone in her voice ). Honey are you okay?  You don't look too well.(Man, with confused look on his face) You want me to leave don't you?(Woman with a slight confused laugh ) Honeeey!?(Man with a somber look ) Okay, I get it, I'll go.This is the kind of banter that goes on in this film.  People don't explain themselves and instead of opening their mouths to tell each other how they are feeling, they assume how someone else is feeling and thus they act accordingly.  Of course, this dilemma could be solved if someone would just say what is on their mind, but no one does.Blood Simple has an intriguing enough story, it's just too bad that the characters don't justify the story.  If stupidity breeds contempt, then that explains why I just didn't like this film as much as I had hoped I would. But it is their first film so that has to be taken into consideration.  The Coen's started out humbly enough but went on to give us some of the best films out there.  Blood Simple was just a way to get the kinks out, consider it a first draft of things to come.6 out of 10- Not quite the film we expect from the Coen's.",Blood Simple
85,film-critic,"That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love.",8,24 September 2004,"Blood Simple completely breaks from the convention of other movies in that no one individual character completely understands the motivations of the other characters, even at the end of the movie. In nearly every other movie that you see, by the end, everyone is happy that they understand the whole story. In Blood Simple, there are misconceptions by each individual.The inventiveness of the screenplay as one character after another misinterprets the actions of the another make this one of my favorites. I also found myself on more than one occasion thinking about the idiosyncrasies of the characters. Each one is different in their own way. It was actually fun to watch the ""good"" guys stumble through the actions, while the infamous ""bad"" guys were perfectionists. My nerves were going crazy when Ray attempts to dispose of a body. He kept doing things wrong, I wanted to jump through the screen and just shake Ray to show him how to do properly finish the crime. I am no criminal, but I could show this guy a thing or two. Abby makes reference in this film about how ""anal"" Marty is about his plans, which is interesting to see why she fell for Ray. He is not ""anal"", in fact, I don't think he thinks through his actions before he does them. I couldn't tell you how many beats my heart missed when watching Ray bury Marty. The sound in this movie was phenomenal. It created such an ambiance to this film. It not only helped build the characters, but also helped build the feeling of this film. This is one of those ""keep you on your toes"" films. You need to be watching and listening to what is happening not only around these characters, but to them as well. Speaking of the characters, I loved the character of Visser. He is one of those characters that would normally be lost to the background, but instead he pulls off as the scene stealer of the film. What immediately impressed me about this film is its simplicity, it had a stark quality, the scenery just had the essentials, and the dialogue was also simple, yet this movie packed quite a story within, and although it was simple, it definitely required strict observation on the part of the viewer to keep up with the events. Someone quoted this film by saying, ""...it was like watching Hitchcock, but on acid..."" and I couldn't agree more!! I love movies like that, where you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING in order to fully understand what is going on. What really impressed me is that this is the Coen's first film, and how amazingly RIGHT they got it, on the first try.Grade: ***** out of *****",Blood Simple
86,sharky_55,I ain't done nothing funny.,8,25 January 2016,"The movie's poster is pulpy. The high heels of a femme fatale leaning in to a sort of manly type wearing cowboy boots. In fact, their legs are arranged at an angle that sees them positively smothered by each other, and on the floor, a gun, no doubt an accessory to their embrace. It makes no attempt to sell this as any other kind of movie. The Coens were still fumbling around, trying to orientate and find their own stylistic tendencies as well as make a big splash for themselves, and end up merely building on the neo-noir movement with a touch of copy and paste. They are eager to tilt the camera at an angle, and let the silence of a phone call linger for longer than ever necessary, and let an errant neon sign hit the in-criminalising photos and act as a backlight. The camera scurries (like Opal) its way towards the fighting pair, and lifts itself over a drunkard sleeping at the bar. And of course, the opening monologue. But there is a hint of brilliance that made all viewers perk up at these brothers and their independently financed feature film debut back in 1984. It is admirable for not completely falling into the cliché. These characters easily could have been wrapped up in a greater and edgier conspiracy; Marty as the mob boss, and Ray as the loyal lackey that has stolen his girl and gone rogue. And even their relationships have a tinge of this, but pan out in such a subversive way that surprised me. When the two men first confront each other, their words are gruff and insincere but they are not immediately trading fists as we might expect. And when little Abby gives her former man a nasty kick in the groin, he doesn't double over comedically, but shudders and crawls down on his knees to heave and vomit. Surely the pain of who is delivering the blow is more prominent than the actual physical pain itself. The Coens and Sonnenfeld etch, as so many noirs do, a story from the landscape, that seems to shape and morph these characters. In Blood Simple it is the heat searing plains of Texas, the endless highways, the desolate lands which allow a live burial at night to go on uninterrupted. Ceiling fans throb and attempt half-heartedly to fend the heat away, and in both day and night, characters are lit in the most dramatic of ways; see as a sunset talk about murder completely illuminates their faces and sweaty brows until it is like night, and as neon signs buzz away in the background as murky compromises are made, and as a murderous, silent stalking action is bathed in a cool blue tint. In the camera-work, each sensation is heightened, but given its own subjective look; as Marty and Ray spit at each other, the fiery incinerator burns in the background, blurred in the shallow focus but with an immediate presence in Ray's mind and as a means of disposal. And later, as one buries the other, the cuts alternate from the spade hitting the dirt to Ray's frenzied reaction, until he willingly steals a quick glance, and it is horrifying; the dying breath puffing up the hill of soil like some monster awakening from the grave. The Coens would later master this sort of landscape etching with No Country for Old Men. Indeed, the opening voice-over, with the grave warning from Visser and the shots of a bare Texas seem to be the premature, less realised version of No Country's own opening. That beginning and that Texas was fraught with natural danger and weary old officers in a frightened and violent world. And of course there is Fargo, in which icy Minnesota was a character in itself and shaped character reactions. Blood Simple's strengths lie in its manipulation of its plot. It's best moments occur when all its jigsaw puzzle pieces align in the most coherent and logical way; each clue left behind, each consequential reaction - which leads to these characters misinterpreting and acting in what they see as the best course of action. They have the right response to finding a gun at a crime scene and being haunted by a past lover, but their ordinary lives have no tools to decode this bloody mess. The initial sexual encounter is amidst shadows and brief, hiding all its spontaneity and passion. Later, after she utters those fatal words, sex is sought for comfort, but what has happened has marred it, and the bed is riddled with paranoia and unease. And the soundtrack too, is vital. The Coens perhaps overreach a tad by combining the grotesque with cheerful, upbeat tracks more than once, but it is a technique that works. When Ray discovers the dead Marty in his office, he is confronted with the horrifying task of cleaning it all up and hiding it from other's eyes. What the Coens do is blast pop music from the bar right on the other side of the wall, not with the intent of blatant contrast, but so that is creeps up on Ray, alongside a girl's laughter, and haunts him with the outcome of being discovered with the dead body of his former boss. And in the dying moments of Visser, as he cackles at a sincerely fearful comment that highlights exactly how farcical this situation is, the soulful Four Tops serenade another moment of absurd focus - a water drop that seems to be more disturbing that a gun wound, and which takes an eternity to fall.",Blood Simple
87,jhclues,Meet the Coen Brothers,9,23 May 2002,"The `noir' genre was alive and well in 1984, thanks to a couple of young, independent filmmakers, Joel and Ethan Coen, who made an auspicious debut that year with their stylistic thriller, `Blood Simple,' written by the Coen Brothers, produced by Ethan and directed by Joel.  And with this film, team Coen establishes their parameters for successfully conveying their often unique perspectives on life and the world in which we live, including casting the future Mrs. Joel Coen, Frances McDormand, as their leading lady; parameters in which the value of the constants are continually changing, offering variables on characters and story that makes each new outing by the Coens fresh, while creating the expectation of the unexpected.	Ray (John Getz) is a bartender in a small town in Texas; the owner of the place, Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) is a successful businessman, but not so successful when it comes to character.  He's a miscreant who, though able to give his wife, Abby (McDormand), a nice house and all the material benefits, is just too much of a creep to make any of it worthwhile.  And so Abby is leaving him.  On the night of her departure, Ray offers to drive her.  Why? Because he's always liked her.	Hurricanes are born from gentle winds; winds that under normal circumstances are no more than gentle breezes, blowing over the land, rustling the leaves in the trees and passing on.  But given the right climate, conditions and currents, those same winds become deadly.  And so it is that from a gentle, innocuous situation, a storm develops.  In Ray's case, because `he always liked her,' it's a storm that's about to sweep him away to a place in his soul that's every bit as desolate as that empty stretch of Texas road upon which he embarks with Abby on a night of dark rain, the likes of which he has never known before, and will never know again.	A stretch of dark, desolate, empty road; a metaphor the Coens first used in this film, and will use again-- and always effectively-- in films like `Fargo' (lonely, snow covered and cold) and `O Brother Where Art Thou?' (southern heat, empty, infinite).  And in retrospect, how apropos that their first film opens with a shot of that very same road; dark, rainy, a dead, unfortunate animal lying to one side of the straight white line, broken and illuminated by the headlights of a car.  Welcome to the world of the Brothers Coen.	Their success here, as well as in the films that follow, begins with their deep grasp and understanding of basic human nature.  That, as well as their innate ability to `think out of the box' and lend fresh perspectives to even the most mundane elements of everyday life.  In this film, as they would do later in `The Man Who Wasn't There,' the Coens take what on the surface appears to be a simple, straightforward situation, and proceed to weave a complex, intricate tapestry of events and emotions that cast a hypnotic spell over their audience.  And they do it, not by manipulating, but by taking that road less traveled.  In real life, it is common to extrapolate-- to consider an upcoming event and follow it through in the mind to a probable conclusion; and when it happens, the results rarely coincide with what had been projected, or if they do, the way in which those results are attained is more often than not quite different than expected.  The Coens understand this, and moreover-- and most importantly-- are able to convey it so succinctly and subtly to their audience, often with a startling, even jaw-dropping effect.  Cinematically, the Coens have the gift of magic; and they use it wisely.	The performances are solid from one and all, though with one exception none tend to stand out as worthy of any special acclaim.  As Ray, Getz convincingly achieves that `average guy' countenance that gives a real edge to the impact of the extraordinary situation in which he finds himself, as well as to the bizarre events as they gradually unfold and into which he is subsequently induced to participate.  McDormand also brings that same believability to Abby, establishing her character's state of mind and convincingly conveying her ignorance as to the true nature and extent of the events she has unwittingly provoked.  And Dan Hedaya is effectively contemptible as Marty.	The performance that really gives the film it's flavor, however, is turned in by M. Emmet Walsh, as Private Investigator Loren Visser.  Walsh, who for many years and in a countless number of films has been one of the best of those unsung heroes of the silver screen, the `character actor,' creates a character in whom he utterly captures the dark and smarmy side of the human condition.  Instead of offering a one-dimensional character, Walsh presents a complex individual predisposed to the foul side of life, who is able to overcome any spark of conscience, and do it without remorse.  Walsh shows us a man with an almost amoral disdain for `goodness,' who embraces the vile as the seemingly natural way of things.  And he does it with detail and nuance, from the almost imperceptible squint/blink he affects, to a laugh that rivals Richard Widmark's in `Kiss of Death.'  It's a laugh that says nothing can touch him; leveled at the world and everyone in it, but most especially, at himself.  It's a memorable performance, arguably one of his best, and it should have earned him an Oscar nomination.	The supporting cast includes Samm-Art Williams (Meurice), Deborah Neumann (Debra), Raquel Gavia (Landlady) and Holly Hunter (uncredited as Helene).  A veritable harbinger of things to come, `Blood Simple' is the one that put the Coen Brothers on the map; an engrossing drama fraught with insights and indications as to the myriad twists and turns of life and where it all can lead, this one is magic-- the magic of the movies.

89,TOMASBBloodhound,Introducing Joel and Ethan Coen.,8,26 June 2012,"So, this is where it all began for the Coen brothers. Blood Simple, written by both and directed by Joel, is the kind of thing they still do well to this day. The story centers around seemingly normal people getting in way over their heads with dangerous crime. There are dozens of prolific directors who could have made this story into a pedestrian crime thriller. But it always helps when the story idea comes from the person who directs a movie. That way they have more incentive to make the film watchable and more freedom to add their personal touches. Blood Simple works on many levels, and it would have been easy to see that these two were bound for great things once this film was completed.The story deals with a seemingly prosperous nightclub owner who hires a scummy private eye to prove is wife is having an affair with one of his bartenders. Dan Hedaya, who has done it all in terms of character acting, paints this businessman as a jealous and brooding type. But also a man who will openly hit on women who come into his club. Not being able to stomach his wife's affair, he hires the same detective to murder them for a fee of ten thousand dollars. That hardly seems like a big enough fee to entice a man to kill two people. Especially when a crime like this would seem very easy to solve. But this detective, played with dripping scumminess by M. Emmet Walsh, agrees. Somewhere along the line, he decides that it would probably be easier to commit just one murder. And before we know it, he has shot the bar owner in the chest and left him for dead after pocketing the cash. To give away any more plot details would be foolish and unnecessary. Just sit back and watch the film and allow the details to soak in...The film is barely over 90 minutes, but it doesn't feel rushed or truncated. The direction allows these characters to come to their own conclusions and try to figure things out on their own. There is not much time wasted on needless exposition or explanations. Things happen. People react to them in terms of what they think must be the reason why. And most of the time they are dead wrong. And the film shows us just how hard it might be to kill someone if you aren't used to doing it. Even if they are helpless and you have a motive, it still might not be that easy. The acting is wonderful. Walsh just leaves a stain on the screen with his scummy performance. Hedaya is reliable as ever. John Getz as his wife's lover gives a perfectly understated performance. Kind of reminded me of Josh Brolin from No Country. Frances McDormand got her part and it changed her life as it started her terrific career and got her a husband, too.The film loses a couple stars for using two detested clichés. One of them a dream sequence, and the other being characters who cannot convey what they mean through words when only a sentence or two would clear things up. Still this is a very good debut, and better than many of their acclaimed films made since. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Blood Simple
90,khanbaliq2,"A tribute to American film noir, Blood Simple was the Coen brothers' remarkably confident film debut.",10,9 July 2010,"Combining elements of classic noir with the look of a cheap horror film, it's not as relaxed as their later work, and less fun: this is a genuinely grim story. A saloon owner (Dan Hedaya) hires a sleazy hit man to kill his unfaithful wife (Frances McDormand) and her lover (John Getz), but the plot rebounds on him.Blood Simple is a debut that announces itself with great style: the Coen brothers' sense of playfulness is in evidence, what with her flamboyant tracking shots and inspired use of light and sound. The final shot, cutting away abruptly to the Four Tops' hit It's The Same Old Song over the end titles, authoritatively confirmed that two prodigious talents had arrived.",Blood Simple
91,carbuff,One of the Coen brothers first movies is also one of their best,9,15 December 2019,"I believe that ""Blood Simple"" is the first major Coen brothers movie (I could check, but I'm feeling lazy), and it's one of their best in my opinion. It very much set the oddball black comedy style that would come to characterize most or all of their later films. This is an obviously low-budget, twisty, thriller/mystery with some normal and some ""odd"" characters, and it hardly ever lets on as to where it's going next. It's short in running time, so you're not risking much of your life watching this, and if you're at all a fan of their other movies, you'd be doing yourself a major disservice to pass this one by. The nearest I'll get to any kind of a spoiler, is that I'd love to see how the police piece together what actually happened. Just watch it to see what I mean. It's worth it.",Blood Simple
92,gab-14712,The Coen Brothers Debut Is Mighty Impressive!,9,24 May 2020,"Joel and Ethan Coen deserve a huge round of applause for the way they stormed the cinematic world with their debut Blood Simple. The Coen Brothers are currently a Hollywood wonder, but their debut back in 1984 was simply unforgettable. They proved themselves master storytellers with their complicated plot. They also proved that they can effectively use visuals to tell they story they want to tell. Yes, this story is bloody, gory, twisty, and incredibly fun.I love the story how the Coen Brothers got their film made. They made a trailer themselves. It was a short trailer about a man dragging a shovel on a road to a man he was going to kill. It was brief and to the point. These unknown men went door-to-door looking for financing so they can make their movie. They succeeded. They were able to raise the million or so dollars needed to make their film. The film then was made in a short time and premiered at the 1984 Sundance Festival where it was well-received and actually won the Grand Jury prize. The film was released to American audiences in 1985 to modest box office success, although it was a major critical success.The Coen's usually co-direct their films as well as write the screenplays together. Most of their films are original works starting with this film, of course. Joel did receive the directing credit here. Regardless of who received credit, the film is well-directed. The Coen's set this film at a deliberate pace to allow things to unfold the way they do and to make the audience think. It is not a simple murder story as it appears on the outside. The duo's films are also known for black humor regardless of plot. Despite the grisly proceedings on the screen, they managed to interject them with humor.The plot is very twisty, so I will be very careful describing the plot. Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) is a Texas bar owner and is considered a mean person. He thinks that his wife, Abby (Frances McDormand) is cheating on him with one of the bartenders, Ray (John Getz). He hires shady private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to confirm. Once so, he rehires him to take the pair out of the picture. That is all I shall say plot-wise. The plot decides to move on a twisty route from there on out, so buckle up!The performances are excellent. M. Emmet Walsh is a well-known character actor who never received his dues. He finally gets to shine in a lead performance. His character is slimy and not considered a great man himself and Walsh absolutely sells his character. Frances McDormand, who would eventually grow into one of Hollywood's darlings, knocks it out of the park in her film debut. These two actors elevate their roles into something else!The film is incredibly detailed. The plot makes sense from an outsider point-of-view, but as you move deeper, you begin to untangle a bloody web of lies and deceit and the plot does not make much sense anymore. The Coen Brothers did an excellent job in creating this feeling because they pay much attention to detail. So does their cinematographer, Barry Sonnenfeld. His shots make sure to capture all the necessary detail needed to advance the plot. The music is haunting thanks to the talent of Carter Burwell. This is Burwell's first film score and would eventually pair up with the Coen Brothers 16 more times.Blood Simple is about as a good as a film debut you would get. The plot is complicated but is supported by memorable, bloody images, macabre humor, and excellent performances from its cast mostly from M. Emmet Walsh. For a film that had a very low budget, it was incredibly detailed. It did not look cheap at all. The Coen's were so proud of their movie and they should rightfully feel that way, especially with the career they had.My Grade: A-",Blood Simple
93,juliankennedy23,Simply Red,6,1 October 2006,Blood Simple: 6/10: Some movies are victims of their own success. Alien is a great film but it seems a little slow nowadays and the plot while very fresh in 1979 has been done to death. (I still love it mind you but if I saw it for the first time this year I would probably wonder what the big deal is) The surprise is gone. I bring that up because at its time Blood Simple was a critics darling. A breath of very fresh air in our nations multiplexes. Not anymore. This kind of noir has been done to death since the Coen brothers revived it twenty plus years ago and Blood Simple through no fault of its own suffers as a result. The plot of the jealous husband and double crosses has had so many spins of the same record (1/2 of them seemingly starring Tim Matheson) that the original simply doesn't have the freshness or power it undoubtedly had back in '84. The movie has great strengths still however. Seeing Frances McDormand looking this cute reminds me of see Lucille Ball or Bette Davis in one of their first films when they were sex objects. And while John Getz gets swallowed up in his straight role Dan Hedaya (Cheers) on the other hand plays sleazy so well I forget I have seen it so many times since.Overall very well done if slightly slow paced and certainly worth a view just too familiar to encourage a repeat viewing.,Blood Simple
94,RonellSowes,Some Of Their Flair But With Rough Edges,5,15 May 2021,"The Coen brother's first film Blood Simple isn't as smooth or polished as their later works, but it still carries that same flair that they're known for.The plot is fairly straight forward, but that doesn't stop it from having plenty of twists and turns. Although its not mystery, the film is hardly predictable and keeps you on your feet with surprises.However, while I may praise it for its fresh visions the film isn't bound together very well. While the scenes aren't exactly boring they don't play off each other very well, and don't give the film the flow or pace it needs.Blood Simple was Joel and Ethan Coen's first picture and it has all the rough edges of one. Still, it also posses many indicators that even if this film isn't that great those behind it have more to offer.",Blood Simple
95,jdkraus,Sit back and enjoy this treat by the Coen Brothers...,9,22 November 2008,"I just saw this recently in my American Cinema class and I have to say for a low-budget movie, ""Blood Simple"" delivers as a tour de force, which could only have been done by the Coen Brothers. I have seen several of their films and this is one of their best. What makes this film so unique, even for a tight budget, is the neo-film noir look they give the film. They use low-key lighting, which darkens the picture, which not only makes the sets minimal, but also casts the dark mood of the film.Also like film noir, the story is centered on a woman, Frances Mcdormand's character, however, the movie departs from this due to the fact that her character is not a villain or power hungry like the woman in ""Out of the Past"", but the men around her fall into destruction. Her husband wants to kill her, her boyfriend wants to escape and live with her, and there's a psychopathic PI that her jealous husband hired to kill her and her boyfriend.Not to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, but it ends like a film noir picture in the sense that no ones wins, however, the main character prevails. And the last shot of the film will leave you to ponder on what it symbolizes.As I mentioned above, I liked the lighting as well as the suspenseful score by Carter Burwell, but it all comes down to the breathtaking talent of the Coen Brothers. Their combination of long and wide shots, intense up-closes, and even the couple of two by four shots really make this cheap film something worthwhile and out of the ordinary.",Blood Simple
96,Movie-12,"Filled with intriguing twists, but lacks suspense and more characters. *** (out of four)",7,20 February 2001,"BLOOD SIMPLE / (1984) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	Those good old Coen brothers, always offering an unexpected twist, an original spin, or a jolt of interest in most any material in which they come into contact. With the 1984 thriller ""Blood Simple,"" they take four ill-fated characters in a complex puzzle that is few on the thrills and surprises but quick on plot twists and intrigue. This film is not as good as ""Fargo,"" a whole lot better than ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?,"" and about equal in par with their inventively raunchy comedy ""The Big Lebowski."" ""Blood Simple"" is a good mystery, both crafty and clever, but never really exceeds the level of simply being satisfactory.	 The genius of the script cannot be denied; everything that happens leads to the next atrocity, greed and desire trap the characters in many diabolical situations of mistrust and murder. The twists do not transpire for the hell of it; they are necessary and fitting. Even usual conventions are raised to a new level; when we sense the corpse in the back seat is not really dead, the filmmakers put a new spin on this always expected cliché, but to be quite frank, I would have preferred the simplistic shocko moment instead of what actually happens here. 	The story begins as a simple betrayal revenge scheme, but like many other Coen brother's movies, it gets much more complicated as the minutes pass. A tousled saloon owner (Dan Hedaya) hires a private eye (M. Emmet Walsh) to murder his wife (Frances McDormand) and her lover (John Getz), who is also one of the bartenders there. There are a series of parallel events that reveal information that we sense if not what it appears, but never really know for certain. Then more events transpire. Then more, all leading to a conclusion that feels like a let down to such a complex and tricky premise.
	There are a few things that do not allow the movie to break lose and just bewilder us, like the unneeded comic tone from the exaggerations and some ridiculous circumstances. There also needed to be more cast members involved in the entanglements, so there are more ""fun"" moments and greater level of suspense. The subplots are distracting, and all other characters aside from the original four are unneeded and disruptive to the movie's smooth flow. I am also surprised the Coen brothers held back on a few elements, the adulterous affair between the bartender and the owner's wife; we expect so much more tantalizing sexuality and innuendoes  from much a distinct pair of filmmakers. They keep that incident to such a distant motive that it is almost unnecessary. 	It is hard not to recommend a film noir like ""Blood Simple"" because of its often amusing and zestful competition of events. The movie's could have been so much more, though, with just a little more nail-biting suspense and key characters, we may have had a classic thriller here. But ""Blood Simple"" is worth the watch as it stands.",Blood Simple

98,Eumenides_0,The Coens Debut - My Favourite!,10,1 April 2005,"There is something about a good crime movie that brings to light the worst and most perverse traits of Mankind, that really forces the characters to open themselves to the viewer and show them the complexity of the human mind and spirit the stuff of great drama! 'Blood Simple' was the Coens' outstanding debut; as far as I'm concerned, it remains their best movie after 'Barton Fink'  their undisputed masterpiece!  and I personally regard it higher than 'Fargo.' It is one of my favourite movies, second only to 'Chinatown,' I'm constantly watching it. Ironically, I originally disliked it the first time I saw it  three years ago?  because I found it very slow-paced (which is only a fault in the viewer and never in the movie) and boring; today I know I was wrong 'Blood Simple' is easily one of the most thrilling and fast-paced movies ever made with a plot that is as simple as it is gripping! This movie is built on the narrative device of 'dramatic irony,' which Alfred Hitchcock used a lot in his movies to create and maintain suspense: withholding vital information from the characters but allowing the viewer to always know what's going on, thus trapping the viewer on his powerlessness to change what he knows is about to happen to characters dear to him. For the whole 90 minutes of 'Blood Simple' only the viewer ever has the whole picture in his mind; the characters, they have small fragments of a disjointed, mystery puzzle that leaves clueless in their own personal worlds, unable to trust anyone. This lack of harmony results in all sorts of misunderstandings and situations that will eventually result in tragedy for the four main characters.On the surface, the movie is very simple: Julian Marty (impeccably played by Dan Hedaya) hires private investigator Loren Visser (Emmet Waslh gives the finest performance in the movie as an unlikely and violent villain) to find out with his wife, Abby (the brilliant Frances McDormand in one of her earliest performances) is sleeping with; and this happens to be Ray (John Getz, whom I didn't know until this movie, but was fascinated with his performance) after some interesting incidents, Marty pays Visser to kill the couple and this is when 'Blood Simple' becomes a distinctive Coen movie. I mean, the first 27 minutes are already brilliant and unique with a rare, raw energy to it. But the last 60 minutes are just outstandingly good! The dialogue is acid, witty, economical; the editing is tight, it's wonderful how one scene seamlessly transits into another; the cinematography, built on dimly-lit interior sets, shadowy spaces, neon lights and other artificial light, is beautiful and unsettling in the way it creates a dark atmosphere. And the sound, with crackling sounds everywhere, helps a lot too! In 90 minutes, the Coens also breathe life into four distinct characters: they're complex, bigger than life, built on just a few strokes of good lines that immediately define them. Marty is obsessive in the way he stalks his wife, domineering, and just disgusting in the way he looks at and treats women: one has the feeling he's this macho cowboy, with his boots, open shirt showing his hairy chest and oily hair, to whom women are just objects. Ray and Abby are a lovely couple, and although she remains this innocent, naïve character until the end, Ray is a tortured man on the inside, doing horrible things for love and slowly growing into paranoia and mistrust.But Visser, he's the cherry on the top. M. Emmet Walsh just plays this vicious human being to a T! He's completely remorseless, amoral, lacking whatever values a normal person would behave. He's greedy, untrustworthy, ruthless, cowardly too, and will do anything for money  he outdoes Carl's and Gaer's inhumanity in 'Fargo;' in many ways, he was the Coens' warm-up for these two memorable hoods, but in many ways he was also a better creation. The way Visser is driven to accomplish his goal and the total callousness of his methods just make him one of the finest villains in modern cinema.For such a short movie, 'Blood Simple' is filled with memorable, even disturbing scenes. There's so much tension in the air when Ray is burying Marty alive in a desolate field, you could cut it with a knife! That's probably the scene that stuck most on my mind when I saw this movie. It gives Ray whole new layer of complexity, and it pays off with one of chilliest lines in a movie ever! However, nothing tops the last ten minutes of the movie, the climax per se, the claustrophobic confrontation between Abby and Visser: it's just fascinating in the way it's handled. For one thing, the Coens show a lot of creativity in a scene that basically takes place inside one single apartment where Abby is locked with Visser; the fact she never saw Visser before and the fact she thinks it's Marty all along make it even chillier! If we want to define this movie's premise, it could be something like 'mistrust leads to ruin,' since it is Abby and Ray's lack of mutual trust that ruins their relationship. 'Blood Simple' is a beautiful movie full of some of the best human horror I have ever seen ambiguous characters doing monstrous things, and yet they ring ever so true with real life. It's a bold movie that says a lot about the darkest side of human nature in the middle of a great conflict, and it makes for one of the most outstanding dramatic experiences I have ever gone through.",Blood Simple

Plenty of that happens in Blood Simple, which is well titled -- it is a very straightforward crime flick, very meaty on suspense without any fat.There's not much in the way of characterization, drama, etc. And a lot of stuff has blown up since 1984 and the film quality is aging a little, but it was well produced and I enjoyed it.Who should see this film:-- action movie buffs-- drama buffs exploring the Coen brothers, I think it's arty enough to satisfy you, barelyI'll give ""Blood Simple"" a 7 out of 10.",Blood Simple
100,SquigglyCrunch,An Interesting Story Overshadowed by Sluggish Pacing,6,20 September 2016,"Blood Simple. follows a man who, upon discovering that his wife is cheating on him with one of his employees, decides that he wants to get rid of both people. The story itself is very good. It's an interesting revenge-ish murder story that is presented very differently from how one might expect, as are many Coen Brothers' movies. The audience might make a prediction as to how it's going to go, then something totally unexpected will happen. Sometimes the movie will focus on something simply for the sake of throwing the audience off, which I think was an awesome idea. Despite the amazing story and mostly great presentation, this movie is one of the most boring ones I've seen all year. I don't know why, it had everything going for it, I just couldn't enjoy it as much as I was probably supposed to. I ended up taking a couple breaks even just so I could move around and wake myself up a little more. Nothing else about this movie is particularly exceptional. The acting is fine, the camera work is fine, the soundtrack is fine. There's nothing else worth mentioning, despite the fact that that's exactly what I'm doing right now. Overall Blood Simple. is an unpredictable, interesting story that drags it's butt slowly along a bed of nails. Sure, there were parts of the movie that did pick up, but that was maybe ten minutes of this 95 minute movie. In the end I'd still recommend this movie. It's a story definitely worth seeing, and who knows? Maybe you won't find it as boring as I did.",Blood Simple

The story of Blood Simple recalls all of the thriller genres, from old pulp fiction tales to drive-in horror films, and is given off-beat twists (as well as truly dark humor) that keep it oh so edgy through out. The story also possesses some memorable characters. The direction is slickly well done, adding lots of dark atmosphere to the film along with an increasing sense of dread.John Getz turns in a nicely subtle performance as the film's occasionally foolish hero. The great Frances McDormand is solid as our heroine. Dan Hedaya is perfectly sinister as McDormand's ill-fated husband. M.

103,bat-5,Texas noir,8,28 March 2000,"Blood Simple is pure Coens.  There are the usual bag of cinematic tricks, the twisting storyline, the seamy characters, and the occasional droplet of dark humor.  The story concerns a bar owner who thinks his wife is cheating on him.  He hires a sleazy private investigator to find out, and when he learns the truth, he wants them dead.  Trouble is, things get kind of complicated when a murder occurs.  The film creates a palpable feeling of tension, where you don't know what to expect next.  Half the fun of this film is trying to figure out what will happen.  A true testament of the well sturctured nature of the film, is the fact that there are only four main characters, and they hold your attention till the very end.  And in traditional film noir fanfare, all of these characters have some sort of sordid business to attend to.

104,DavidSim240183,Welcome to the world of the Coen Brothers,10,2 February 2007,"Blood Simple marked the debut of the extraordinarily talented Joel and Ethan Coen. Better known as the Coen Brothers. Its hard to describe the appeal of their films. Because their approach to storytelling is sometimes so bizarre it defies belief. And yet they have that unique ability to combine visuals, sound and virtuoso acting into a satisfying cohesive whole.One thing that must be said for the Coens' is they have a rather black sense of humour. Sometimes it feels like they put thumbscrews on their actors, and with every scene, they tighten them. Just a little bit. Just to add that tiny bit more pressure. And because of their superb direction, the pressure for these poor characters continues to build and build until things reach critical mass.Blood Simple is a perfect example of that. Even at the beginning of their directorial career, the Coens' showed their remarkable assurance with crafting a story, and especially weaving a complex web of narratives. Blood Simple is a modern day film-noir. Not an easy thing to accomplish at the best of times, but the Coens' are masters of film-making. They transform BS from what could have been a standard murder plot, through paranoia, mix ups and misunderstandings into a miniature masterpiece.Blood Simple is almost like a warm-up to the Coens' excellent kidnapping caper Fargo. Both films have similar themes, a short running time and tight direction. While Fargo still remains their finest film to date, Blood Simple is not that far behind. I don't want to reveal too much. The primary joy of this film is the trail of breadcrumbs the Coens' leave for us to follow. The way it piles on surprise after surprise, as well as a few timely plot twists are ever engaging. Especially if you take into account that when you follow the trail backwards, they're all completely plausible, tempered with cool, implacable logic.Texan bar-owner Marty (Dan Hedaya) knows his wife Abby (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with one of his bartenders, Ray (John Getz). The Coens' direct this discovery very well in a scene where Marty calls them while they've spent the night together in a motel room. A private detective (played to sleazoid perfection by M. Emmet Walsh) has been hired by Marty to keep an eye on the pair, and when it becomes clear Abby won't break it off, Marty wants them dead.The detective sets a plan into motion. A plan that involves double-crosses, murder and lots of intricate plotting that left my head spinning. In the end, Marty gets Abby to end the relationship. But not in the way he expected.The similarities with Fargo are where we have these two plots, one a kidnapping, the other murder, and how through a completely logical chain of events, things spiral out of control in a spectacular fashion.The Coens' direction is exceptional. They keep a firm hand on the reins, never losing sight of the plot, even when things are getting more chaotic by the moment. Even at this early stage, the Coens' show directorial flourishes that would become their trademarks. Like the stunning camera angle the PI has of a tap from the underside. Or their penchant for black comedy like the running gag of Marty throwing up everything from vomit to blood.There are some excellent performances all around, complemented by the Coens' smooth assurance. John Getz makes a likable everyman, especially when this inherently decent man's doubts as to his relationship with Abby continue to mount. All blended with a healthy dose of paranoia. That becomes decidedly unhealthy.Frances McDormand began her career here. She hadn't quite polished the acting style that would win her a well deserved Oscar for Fargo. But she does well in her film debut. The climax shows off some of her burgeoning talent, and she is always sympathetic.Dan Hedaya brings a cool intensity to Marty's character. He looks like a powder keg getting ready to explode. I love the scene where he's sitting on the back steps of his bar. Behind him, a bug zapper is doing its job. The shorts and static it generates seem to reflect his volatile mood. A quality touch by the Coens'.But its M Emmet Walsh who gives Blood Simple its life. He's the one who keeps the momentum steady. A sleaze through and through, his vindictive nature makes him detestable, even though he crafts a surprisingly ingenious murder plot. His presence during the climax is a powerhouse performance of controlled evil and determination. In the end, he provides a surprising summation of the events. In much the same way Frances McDormand did in Fargo.Blood Simple is a film that should not be forgotten. Its lost none of its effectiveness over the years. It provides a finely crafted modern day morality tale, it has some superb touches (like the 20 minute scene disposing of a dead body with almost no dialogue) and announced to the world the sheer inherent talent of the Coen Brothers.Magnificent!!",Blood Simple
105,avik-basu1889,The Beginning of the Coen Era !!!!!,8,28 November 2014,"I had already watched many other films of the Coen brothers before watching their debut effort. I was already their admirer before deciding to check out how they started off in the film making business. Being familiar with their subsequent films made me notice so many aspects of Blood Simple which were similar to their other films. The movie starts off in a way which is extremely similar to No Country for Old Men. It also has a lot of the dark comedy which has since become an indispensable part of their other films.Overall, this is a movie which involves themes of jealousy, infidelity and the Coens' favourite theme of having to pay for your sins. It is very Hitchcockian in its style. From a directorial standpoint, the movie is flawless. Joel Cohen brilliantly manages to create an atmosphere with palpable tension. There are long scenes and sequences without any dialogue and the scenes convey everything that is to be conveyed visually and through facial expressions of the actors. However I thought the script in some cases was slightly weak with the use of contrived conveniences for the sake of progressing the story. I also thought the acting in a few scenes was a little plastic and less convincing. But overall this is still a very well made film with some flaws. The directing is fantastic, the screenplay is flawed but still good. The acting could have been better. This film shows how the Coen brothers began and it also gives us an idea of how they far they have come since this first outing.",Blood Simple
106,Marc_Israel_365,Not as clear or gripping as it needs to be,7,9 September 2014,"After watching this again for the first time in 5 years, I followed the plot a bit better, but still missed the wife's gifted gun at the scene of the crime. I spent 20 minutes wondering why the bartender would have even attempted to clean up such a mess and involve himself so explicitly. Yes, once blood spills, it's hard to clean up and karma certainly keeps its' eyes on most here. The acting works here, even if Getz' character carries the weight of the guilt to point that he seems routinely about to fall over after his part is complete. This is the point of the film, but having the wife end up untouched left me a little sore, It was her transgressions that started the series of events, misunderstandings and fait accompli.",Blood Simple
107,Mort-31,They can do even better,10,3 August 2001,"The first masterpiece of the Coen brothers was the last I saw, and I was surprised to see that they can do even better than in `Raising Arizona', `Barton Fink' and `Miller's Crossing'. The dialogues  there are not many  are sharp and typically American (I was grateful for the subtitles because that accent); the camera shows us postmodern pictures at night, using light and shadow with playful pleasure.Not all the characteristics of Coen movies have been developed in this movie. We don't find the running gag with the vanishing point (desk; hotel corridor; rails; highway; bowling alley), but that's okay: it wouldn't fit in. We already experience the Coens' obsession with manieristic pictures, stupid characters and inevitable misconceptions. Unlike other black thrillers, in Blood Simple` every person acts more or less rationally, comprehensibly; still their plans completely go wrong.The film grows denser, better and better towards the end. The last scenes with M. Emmett Walsh and Frances McDormand show the insane but brilliant brain of Joel and Ethan Coen. And the very, very last picture gives a clue of in which style, with which attitude the Coens' film career would develop. I'm impatiently waiting for The Man Who Wasn't There`!",Blood Simple
108,Med-Jasta,Contrived and slow,1,13 August 2020,"I hate to say it but it's true. So much of what happens is forced and disingenuine. I am a fan of the Cohen's but this one had too many moments that felt like amateurs trying to make a name for themselves. The Cohen's sometimes use their talent to be ""anti Hollywood"" instead of telling their own story.It feels like a first movie in the sense where they're trying to squeeze every idea into one movie. And that they're trying to break conventions just to break them. Pretty much all the camera moves don't feel right. And there are so many scenes and moments of dialogue that aren't cool enough to outweigh their pointlessness.Some things the characters do don't make any sense and are clearly done to make a weird moment or advance the plot.I loved this movie the first time I saw it about ten years ago. But maybe because I was about the age of the Cohen's when they made the movie. And now I've matured past this movie like they have.Some cool things for sure but I couldn't look past the contrived ones.",Blood Simple
109,jcbutthead86,"A Brilliant,Unforgettable Film Noir-Mystery Thriller Classic. An Excellent Debut From The Coen Brothers.",10,17 May 2013,"Blood Simple is one of the best Film Noir/Mystery/Thrillers ever made and a excellent debut from The Coen Brothers. Filled with great, atmospheric direction,wonderful acting and a great score Blood Simple is The Coen Brothers at their best.Set in Texas,Blood Simple tells the story of bar owner Julian Marty(Dan Hedaya)who suspects that his wife Abby(Frances McDormand)is having an affair with Ray(John Getz)one of Marty's bartenders. Angry about the affair,Marty hires sleazy private detective Loren Visser(M. Emmett Walsh)to kill Abby and Ray. But Abby,Ray,Marty and Visser discover that when Blood flows nothing is simple or straight forward but Blood Simple.Released in 1985,Blood Simple was the classic debut from master filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen AKA The Coen Brothers and was the first of many masterpieces and classics from The Coen Brothers and is one of the best film debuts of all time. One of the reasons Blood Simple is a great film and a classic is because The Coen Brothers took the Film Noir genre with Blood Simple and uses the influence of Film Noir and Mystery icons such as Dashell Hammett,Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain and created an original and stylish film that grabs you by the throat right from the opening credits all the way to the end. Like any great Film Noir Blood Simple gives viewers a dark world with amoral characters and where nothing is for certain and nothing is what it seems where you're not sure who's a good or who's bad and the things that happen to the characters are unpredictable and unexpected. Blood Simple is the beginning and start of many films that The Coen Brothers deal with Film Noir and The Coens know the Film Noir genre like the back of their hands and it truly shows in this film. Blood Simple is a film that is filled with Suspense and dread where you don't what's going to happen or when and you as the viewer are on edge because of the twists and turns that happen in the film that will make you wonder what's going on and why. Blood Simple sometimes has the feel of a Horror film because of the way people are getting killed and blood being all over the place and the sense of darkness and fear that hangs over the film where the characters and the viewers are put into a paranoid state of mind and you have to look over both shoulders. What I also love about the film is the dark and twisted sense of humor the film has because there are some moments in the film that are balanced between being serious and funny and absurd as well as offbeat and over the top where anything and everything can happen in a morbid and insane fashion which is something that has happened in many of The Coen Brothers films. The photography by Barry Sonnenfield is beautiful and dark and makes Texas look like a haunting nightmare and a isolated land that makes the characters feel alone. The screenplay by The Coen Brothers is amazing with Coens giving the characters memorable and funny dialog and giving the film and the characters many great moments. The main characters in the film are not always likable but are memorable and strike a perfect balance between good and evil with Ray and Abby they feel they're doing good despite their actions where as Marty and Private Detective Visser are pure evil with no likable or redeemable qualities. That being there are no good guys and bad guys just characters with moral ambiguity. The violence in the film is brutal,bloody and uncompromising and when the violence happens it is fast and unexpected and when you at the screen the violence will shock you and disturb you. The final 12-15 minutes of this film are masterful and is filled with great suspense and terror. It's a great conclusion that you won't forget and is one of the Coen Brothers best endings.The cast does great jobs in their roles. John Getz is great and effective as Ray,Abby's boyfriend,Getz bringing depth and believability to the role. Frances McDormand is wonderful and memorable as Abby,with McDormand making Abby likable and sympathetic. Great character actor Dan Hedaya is amazing as the Julian Marty,Abby's unstable husband. Another great character actor M. Emmett Walsh is brilliant as private detective Loren Visser,who in my opinion is one of the best villains in film history. Walsh is menacing,unforgettable and funny in the role. Samm-Art Williams is fantastic and funny in his role as Maurice,one of Marty's bartenders. Also,lookout for an uncredited voice cameo from Holly Hunter.The direction by The Coen Brothers is excellent,with the Coens always moving the camera and great angles and shots giving the film a dark atmosphere. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is is wonderful,dark and effective and fits with the films dark tone. A powerful score by Burwell. I also loved the use of the classic tune The Same Old Song by The Four Tops.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Film Noir,Mystery-Thrillers or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Blood Simple,a brilliant,unforgettable classic from The Coen Brothers that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10",Blood Simple
110,jldmp1,Jupiter Effect,9,19 June 2006,"This is fine film-noir that builds a huge visual narrative space which belies its shoestring budget. What makes this work are the wide areas of silence in which the characters believe they are sorting out their places in the continuum. Only the Coens keep digging deeper holes of irony for them; the thrill lies in watching everybody squirm.The con on the viewer is first-rate...we are led to think that one character possesses the Jovian gravity that rains down the arbitrary forces of destruction. But that notion is turned upside-down on us twice...watch it for this -- the effect highlights the difference between noir and the ordinary 'plot twists' of a lesser movie.The Coens pack a lot of punch into this, mainly using, yes, the Hitchcock vocabulary; most obviously the mopped up blood from ""Psycho"". Note the ""impossible"" camera perspectives, especially the levitating shot up behind a dead man, to the ceiling and peering down through the rotating fan blades. And an early trademark 'running up with a hand held camera' shot. Disappointingly, the DVD transfer leaves out the 'Motown Night' dialogue between the bartender and patron.Fine minimalist use of lighting and voluminous shadows in which to float the story.",Blood Simple
111,hemisphere65-1,"Good movie, but slow build-up.",10,23 August 2021,"McDormand and Walsh are great, Hedaya is pretty good, and Getz is embarrassingly bad.He drags the movie down a couple of notches with his pathetic performance.I can't believe some reviewers complain about the characters doing stupid things; I'm pretty sure that was the point!",Blood Simple
112,OldAle1,"The Coens first effort is a dark, noirish tragedy with great promise",8,22 April 2008,"I barely remembered this film from my first time watching it, 20 years ago or so in a theatrical revival, possibly while still in college. The cleaning up of the blood, the burying of the body...that was about it. I'm pleased to say that it's worth remembering, and that it establishes much of the Coen brothers' principle preoccupations and methods early on. Frances McDorman stars in the first of several roles she has played for her husband Joel and brother-in-law Ethan, as an unhappy wife married to a successful Austin-area club owner (Dan Hedaya, magnetic) who gets involved with one of hubby's employees (John Getz) and calls down her husband's wrath, setting a series of violent events in motion engineered by his unsavory and totally amoral private eye, played with the perfect combination of sardonic humor, good ol' boy jollity and complete ruthlessness by M Emmett Walsh. The music is by Carter Burwell, a collaborator ever since, and Barry Sonnenfeld's photography contributes a palette at turns high-contrast and bright, or burnished and glossy, that they have used ever since albeit with Sonnenfeld taking leave after Raising Arizona. The noirish atmosphere and storyline, too, show signs of what's to come.What's interesting to me, overall though, is how serious the film is. Walsh is funny, sure, and there are moments of dark humor throughout, but the prevailing tone is one of tragedy and loss, of poor decisions made poorer through bad luck and stupidity; there is little of the Coens' usual snarky, often juvenile jokesterism. McDormand's Abby strikes me as the most interesting character in many ways, though the most inscrutable; her real feelings for both husband and lover never seem really accessible either to us or to anyone in this minor-key bloodbath. She sets the whole story in motion, but through the whole center portion of the film is mostly off-camera or of secondary importance, which makes her final completion of the dance of vengeance all the more gripping.

115,asifahsankhan,In the heart of Texas. . . some corpses just don't stay dead. . . forever!,8,24 July 2017,"""Blood Simple"" may be a low-budget affair, but the casting of great character actors like M Emmet Walsh and Dan Hedaya wring true tension out of this film. As has become commonplace on their projects, the brothers Joel and Ethan Coen write, produce, and direct this film.Dan Hedaya plays a brooding and bitterly jealous bar owner who wreaks revenge on his wife and lover by arranging to have them killed. Hired for the job is the sleazy laughter-racked private eye Walsh, who seems forever to be attracting flies.Deception appears to run deep in the heart of Texas and some corpses don't stay dead forever. A satisfying plot of twists and vicious black humour unravels to a tense conclusion with the assembled cast clearly revelling in their roles.The pace can at times be a touch slow, but it's easy to see why the Coens allow certain scenes to simmer, especially when their actors are chewing up the screen as they do. They alone maintain the interest but Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography defies the low budget, turning this into a stylish-looking thriller that boasts many clever shots.Intriguing, clever, and often surprisingly funny there's plenty to please in this thriller, that remains fresh and original even today.",Blood Simple
116,antagonist117,"More brooding than many later Coen films, but with some defining elements in place",8,16 October 2014,"Some filmmakers revel in the idea of ""the perfect crime."" Joel and Ethan Coen, on the other hand, tell stories about half-baked crimes that go terribly, grimly, outrageously wrong. Already in ""Blood Simple,"" the first film credit for the Coen brothers and for their frequent collaborator Frances McDormand, the elements of their grisly but sardonic formula were in place. An unassuming rural setting (the film was shot in and around Austin, but only in its least populous corners), pitiful and pitiable suckers caught up in a mess of their own inept devising, double crosses, and the joyously choreographed juxtaposition of popular music with violence. The latter has become something of a cliché, thanks to heavy rotation not only in Coen brothers movies but in Quentin Tarantino films, prestige TV dramas, and so on, but few examples are as effectively jarring as the sudden, celebratory intrusion of ""Same Old Song"" by The Four Tops into ""Blood Simple.""For the most part, though, ""Blood Simple"" emphasizes the sadness of its characters over humor. The tone is therefore closer to the Coens' Oscar-winning ""No Country for Old Men"" than to ""Fargo,"" despite the presence of McDormand as a thickly-accented, gun-toting center both here and in the latter film. Given the Coens's flair for wordplay, of which there are glimmers here in an opening voice-over, it is notable that the most intense scenes in ""Blood Simple"" are virtually silent. Midway through, an increasingly grotesque sequence depicts a ham- fisted murder attempt and a messy cover-up. This long segment is full of brilliant visual misdirection; every time we're sure we know what's coming, and a new and more horrible possibility is introduced instead. The looks exchanged between John Getz's ""Ray"" and Dan Hedaya's ""Marty"" don't say much, because communication would ruin the farcical spiral of misunderstandings that drives the rest of the film. Their faces, therefore, reveal only raw feelings: the pain, fear, anger, sorrow, guilt, and jealousy that define their characters.There is, then, more brooding here than in later Coen productions, which usually have more comic relief and do not drag out their carnage to quite the same extent. But although the Coens have tinkered with the balance of their engaging formula, they have seldom abandoned it, and in many ways ""Blood Simple"" feels like a far-sighted prevision of classics to come.",Blood Simple
117,Sonatine97,"""Down in Texas, you're on your own!"" (with a little help here & there)",9,21 July 2000,"A delicious Coen offering, perhaps one of the best film noirs to come out of an indie studio, Blood Simple has it all in spades.A spooky barowner hires a slimy dick to murder his wandering wife & dumb boyfriend, but things get slightly out of hands when the dick has an ulterior motive all of his own.
Yeah, ok, this kind of story has been done to death a million times so what makes this movie so special. Easy..the Coens don't go for the obvious, instead they lead the viewer into unchartered waters. Rather than letting us think what should happen next, they spike that theory with something a little different, making for a more entertaining film.The acting is good, although I have to say I wasn't particularly impressed with the dreary boyfriend, Ray (John Getz). Throughout the film he had that ""out to lunch"" sign permanently etched over his face - no emotion, no wit, no charm in his voice just the same dreary monotone throughout, which soon begins to irritate.On the other side of the coin Frances McDormand's, Abby, was quite good all things considered, especially since this was her debut film. She too carries the same kind of rabbit-in-headlights facial expression but at least she has a slightly wider emotional ability than Getz.Best actor of all was from M. Emmet Walsh, as the private detective, Visser. I've always liked Walsh even though he doesn't get the credit or enough movies he so much deserves. I particularly liked his Southern Texas accent which just about summed up the atmosphere to a tee.  But its the Coens who steer the film with some very good little twists; while the cinematography is excellent from Barry Sonnenfeld. There's one scene I particularly liked. Back in the bar we have the camera playing the 1st person as it dollies up the bar table and then ""hops"" over an outstretched drunk before gliding up the bar once more with the faintest of ""bumps""! The music is exceptionally good, lots of simple but haunting piano work that lingers in the memory as a portent of expectation. Another good example is with Getz out in the field where a body has been buried. The camera views Getz from a distance. The music starts along with the engine of his car, only for the music to stop as the engine cuts out. It then returns once more as the he finally gets the car moving. A simple little trick but beautifully executed.I haven't seen the Director's cut, but if it's any better than the original then I'm in for a treat.****/*****",Blood Simple
118,Brogan,Even the Coen's had to start somewhere...,10,11 August 2000,"BLOOD SIMPLE is the first major film made by the much loved Joel and Ethan Coen, the Coen brothers.  Not only is it their first, but also their most serious film.  It's a film like DUEL, THX-1138, and MEAN STREETS it takes a small budget film with a excellent script and clever directing to make a impression for Hollywood executives.  And with BLOOD SIMPLE, it's obvious to show how the Coen's went on to direct some other modern classic like RASING ARIZONA, BIG LEBOWSKI, and FARGO. BLOOD SIMPLE's plot is similar to the title, blood and simple.  A bartender, Ray (John Getz) is in love with Abby (Francis McDormand).  The problem is that Ray's boss and Abby's husband Marty (Dan Hedaya) is very jealous and wants to see both of the lovers dead.  Enter slimy and perverted private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh), who Marty hires to kill both Ray and Abby.  It weither Loren will follow Marty's orders or not, and what will happen next has BLOOD SIMPLE showning twists and turns. I always enjoy a Coen brother's film, and BLOOD SIMPLE is a Coen brother's film, so I enjoyed it!  The acting by all of the actors, including M. Emmet Walsh is fantastic.  It's not flashy costumes or excellent sets or scenery that make a actor good, it's the acting.  I also really loved the cinemtography by now director Barry Sonnenfiled.  I really wish that Sonnenfield (who is a great director) would go back once in a while to do cinematography, I really love it.  And that alone makes BLOOD SIMPLE a unique modern film noir thriller.  Plus with this being a director's cut, I hardly noticed any changes. It's still a great movie, with dry humor and witty suspense. BLOOD SIMPLE is a movie that is the milestone of independent films, it is the first to draw a good box office and critical acclaim.  Even a introduction before the feature has a film perservation member discuss on why BLOOD SIMPLE is the modern classic that it is today.  With it's small budget, little effects and not too famous stars, it takes imagination and creativity.  And BLOOD SIMPLE shows that for the Coen brothers.  ***** (out of five)",Blood Simple

122,blakiepeterson,A Terrific Neo-Noir,9,2 May 2015,"Sometimes, you can tell a filmmaker is going to join the ranks of Hitchcock, Chabrol, or De Palma just based off of their debut — Blood Simple was Joel and Ethan Coen's first stab at movie-making, but you wouldn't know it. Over the years, I've found that, if a debut is truly great, it transcends everything we feel we've come to know about film. Clichés are suddenly unfamiliar. Amateur ideas are no longer amateur; they're inventions.Terms like ""film noir,"" and ""dark comedy"" are often thrown around when discussing Blood Simple, but I feel uncomfortable labeling it right away. The film does pay slight homage to the days of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, but it eclipses any of our preconceived sentiments. The Coens are gifted filmmakers that can bounce wall to wall when it comes to any genre, but in every movie they make, at the center is a subtly tongue-in-cheek approach that makes even the most callous of violence droll in its delivery. Most directors take years to master a certain tone, but not the Coens. It's as if they secretly made 50 movies before this one as practice and didn't tell anybody.The plot is thin but effective: A Texas bar owner (Dan Hedaya) hires a crooked private eye (M. Emmet Walsh) to murder his unfaithful wife (Frances McDormand, Joel Coen's partner-in-crime who was also making her film debut) and her lover (John Getz), only to be double-crossed for $10,000. This sort of story has been recycled since the sordid days of Double Indemnity, but it's not the story itself that matters; it's the way that it's told.As the ensemble is small and tightly wound, the Coens pay particular attention to their every movement and decision with caustic pleasure. The wife, portrayed with minimalist clarity by the incomparable McDormand, isn't a seductive Lana Turner-type but rather a fatigued housewife who has tolerated her stoic husband long enough. Hedaya doesn't do much besides brood with stormy, silent evil, but we're more than convinced that he would hire someone to kill.One of the best scenes in the film sees a man (I won't say who, in order to keep the plot firmly plump) trying to dispose of a body — only the body isn't quite dead. The sequence is developed at an agonizingly slow pace, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. While uneasily comedic, it takes all the fun and games from the previous events and revamps the remainder of the film into an agitated, claustrophobic piece of tension. But what still makes Blood Simple so exciting all these years later is how much it feels like a statement. Quentin Tarantino rewrote the revenge film with Kill Bill; Roman Polanski gave horror a new face with Rosemary's Baby; the Coen Brothers started an independent film era that has continued with greatness for three decades. Putting Fargo, The Big Lewboski, and Inside Llewyn Davis into consideration, Blood Simple gets an A-. But that doesn't make it any less of a masterwork.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",Blood Simple
123,Afracious,A very dark blend of gory noirish turns,8,19 January 2000,"Blood Simple opens inside a car, it is raining heavily outside and the wipers are struggling to clear the screen, as we listen to two of main characters saying how they like each other. The married woman, Abby, (talented Frances McDormand) is having an affair with Ray (John Getz). Abby's husband, bar owner Marty (played by a laconic Dan Hedaya), suspects this and hires a sleazy private eye, Visser (brilliantly portrayed by M. Emmet Walsh), to investigate. Visser returns with photographic evidence and Marty becomes overcome with jealousy to the point where he offers Visser $10,000 to murder them both. Visser agrees but double crosses him, and then the film goes into a series of twists and turns with some intriguing scenes, the final one in particular is memorable. It is a suspenseful film and very dark, there's not much light in the film. It is dripping with the Coen's trademark style of dark, offbeat characters, diverse camera shots and an atmospheric chill in the air, and with blood being in its title, it delivers some of that in parts, too.",Blood Simple

Emmet Walsh and Dan Heyada are the two best actors in this thing and they are darn good. Walsh plays the crazy card even better than Heyada and he is supposed to be the nuttiest out of the four leads. Walsh is a super- charged villain and Heyada is just Superman. A note here. None of these characters will promote sympathy in anyone but only one doesn't do what they planned to do which is quite ironic to me. The plot twists like a corkscrew you never know what is gonna happen next classic Cohen brothers.

When Entertainment Weekly reviewed it a week ago, I decided that I wanted to see it again even more.I had not rated the movie 1-10 from my first viewing and could not remember much about the movie except that I thought it was probably an 8 or 9. I remembered it being a murder mystery.Well, when I watched it again, I was somewhat disappointed. It isn't that it is bad, but it lacked so much sophistication that movies nowadays have. Perhaps it was an 8 or 9 at the time, but a 7 today.There were so many blunders by the would-be criminals in this movie that it was actually comical. And, there were many inconsistencies in the movie. Coens also directed FARGO and RAISING ARIZONA - two movies that I begrudgingly gave 7's to also.If you want a low budget, bloody, inconsistent movie that is 16 years old, then this is it.

135,blazesnakes9,Excellent 1980's neo-noir,10,14 August 2014,"Suspense. It's the thing that tantalizes the viewers. Suspense is build on layers of tension and dread. Haven't you had that kind of feeling while watching a thriller? I bet you have. That is what thrillers are all about. The feeling of something jumping out in front of you or a very creepy feeling running through your mind. Your heart may race, but you must not take your eyes off the screen. You wouldn't want to fall asleep while watching a thriller because you'll miss much of it. Blood Simple is one of those movies.The story is centered around four characters. Each of the four characters all have different perspectives. There's Julian, (Dan Hedaya). Julian is a sleazy saloon owner who thinks his wife is cheating on him. Abby, (Frances McDormand), is his wife who's seeing another man. Ray, (John Getz), is the man she's seeing. An private investigator, (M. Emmet Walsh), is also brought into the story. All of the four characters are very essential in the plot of this movie. But to tell you the truth, this plot is very complicated to follow. Which is why I won't revealed much of what's going on. That's one of the biggest surprises that happened to me while watching Blood Simple.The feeling of dread really did give me the creeps because of the way the characters are trying to figure what to do in this plot. They're not your average movie characters. These are people who don't know what's going to happened next. Most movies try to get a cheap thrill out of the audience by inserting standard movie characters into a very routine plot. Blood Simple skips over all that.This is a very promising movie that does hold your attention while the viewer is gripping onto their chair while watching it unfold. What's brilliant is the way the cinematography focuses on the rural aspect of the setting. The movie does a great of creating a visually stunning world of Texas. They are a lot of great visuals that I'll always remembered. Dust creeping underneath a door. Blood dripping onto a hardwood floor. The way the shadows are arranged at night. My favorite visual out of all of them is the freshly plowed fields that are used in the movie. Credited the film's cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld who would later move on with other big projects such as Men in Black in 1997.Blood Simple was directed by Joel Coen and was written by both his brother, Ethan and himself. To me, the Coen brothers did an amazing job with the making of this movie. I don't have anything bad to say to them because of what I saw on the screen. Not only is this a very good- looking picture, but it is very well-written. Of course, it would be hard to write serious dialogue without having to overact. That what makes them such great movie-makers. They know how to create a visually stunning world by using much of what is there.The plot of Blood Simple is not easy to follow since the film includes several double crosses and twists. But, the most interesting aspect of all is the fact that it doesn't rely on formula. Most thrillers today are filled with the ordinary set-up. Shootouts, car chases, confrontations and explosions. Not here. This movie works like a well- oiled machine. It held my attention, yes, but it also made me hold onto my seat. I couldn't resist it. It's that kind of feeling that makes thrillers so good.M. Emmet Walsh, who is a character actor, does an amazing job of playing the P.I. who's job is to spy on the cheating couple. Even with that cowboy hat on, he brings an very sinister feeling to the movie. In one particular scene in the movie, he tries to take a picture of them together, but he can't help it to creep into the house and out of the house without making a noise. Also, the music by Carter Burwell is great especially in that scene because it creates a sense of suspense that the audience is thriving for. We're hanging onto the seat of our chairs while everything starts to fall apart. Frances McDormand, who plays Abby, is very good as the woman who is stuck in this murder plot. You might think that she is going to scream her head off throughout the entire movie. But, she doesn't. She knows how to keep a straight face and act in a way that doesn't require screaming or hollering. She's innocent and we, as the audience can buy that. The fact that in most thrillers, the actress is usually screaming throughout the entire movie. Once again, Blood Simple skips over the clichés.Blood Simple is a classic example of the neo-noir genre. I enjoyed watching these kind of movies because even though the plot is twisted, it leaves you something to think about. In the case of this movie, I had something to think about. It really did touch me through my nerves and my fears. As for the Coen brothers, this is their opening into the movie world. Welcome to Hollywood. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Blood Simple
136,dave-sturm,"""Down here, you're on your own.""",9,15 March 2008,"I saw this when it came out in 1984 in a college auditorium packed with students. During the final 5 minutes, half of the audience was screaming their heads off and the other half were laughing hysterically. When M. Emit Walsh utters the final line in the movie, the place went crazy. People were still laughing in the parking lot. It is one of the best movie endings of all time.From the opening scene, when the camera tracks down a saloon bar and floats up to get over a drunk slumped on the counter, I knew we were in for some fun. I won't bother explaining the plot except that it depends on the confusion and misunderstanding of four people tied together in a murder plot. Rarely have wrong conclusions proved so fatal.What I love about this movie is how it keeps reminding you that it's a movie. Examples:One character makes a dramatic revelation to another. Immediately, we see a rolled-up newspaper tumble toward us until it slams into a screen door.One character buries another in the middle of a field at night. At dawn, an overhead shot shows blatantly obvious tire tracks across a fresh plowed field.Oncoming car signals driver, who has just committed a murder, that he can shut his car lights off. Driver shuts them off. As the oncoming driver passes, he playfully ""shoots"" with his finger out the window.And the final deadly showdown between two characters who are virtually face to face, but can't see each other because there's a wall between them, has to be one of the most ingeniously filmed scenes in movie history.The great Coen brothers movie trinity are this, ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo."" I would also include ""No Country,"" but the beauty of that movie has more to do with Corman McCarthy's novel than the brothers themselves.The Coens are cinema's greatest geniuses of the sly wink.",Blood Simple
137,Don-102,A Simple Lesson: Don't Ever Hire Someone To Bump Off Your Wife...,10,8 April 1999,"From BLOOD SIMPLE to FARGO,  the Coen Brothers have made us laugh, freaked us out, had us smirk, and make us wonder.  The message with this movie is simple:  Just don't get anyone to do your dirty work.  It always ends up exploding in your face.  BLOOD SIMPLE presents a quiet explosion of gut-wrenching fright with more plot twists than a Philly soft pretzel. There are a lot of corpses walking around and this is no supernatural tale. It is kind of like a classy TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, with guns taking the place of the saws and jukebox music replacing the buzz.  The blood is all over and the characters are certainly classless, but the film is such a monument to film noir and murder mystery, it is a classic.Director of Photography Barry Sonnenfeld, who would later direct MEN IN BLACK and GET SHORTY shoots a few days in the lives of some backwards people in drab daylight and dusty, bloody night.  You just about see it all in terms of murder, deception, and plot.  The Coens even borrow from Antonioni's BLOW-UP, when a sleazy private eye (played wonderfully by M. Emmet Walsh) produces some pictures to a jealous husband that have you asking what really happened.  I just saw the movie for the first time in 9 years and it is remarkable how little I remembered it.  I owe this to its unique plot:  like CITIZEN KANE or USUAL SUSPECTS, you see something different everytime and pick up on things you cannot do on one viewing alone.This is low-budget fare, but even if the Coens had more money, it would've been preferable to shoot it this way.  FARGO was not exactly a big studio bonanza itself and that, along with BLOOD SIMPLE, are their two finest films.  Some familiar Coen symbols are here.  The running highway under headlights on a  car with a (dead or alive) body in the back; the dry local humor of the film's location (deep in Texas, Arizona in RAISING ARIZONA, North Dakota in FARGO); and a unique sense of evil in the heartland much like a Hitchcock film.  This comment would not be posted if I was to get into the story in any detail, so just watch it and trust me.  There are movies that involve you and others that bore you.  BLOOD SIMPLE has you cringing, talking to the screen, and realizing that your life is fine compared to the morally corrupt folks in this hair-raising thriller.RATING: 10 of 10",Blood Simple
138,rmarkd,"For God's sake, just close the curtains",7,12 July 2020,"Blood Simple is a, well, simple movie about cheating and revenge. Abby (Frances McDormand) and Ray (John Getz) have an affair, which is photographed by PI Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh). He shows the pictures to Abby's husband Marty (Dan Hedaya). Marty ultimately asks Loren to kill Abby and Ray for 10,000, but Loren double crosses Marty by faking photographs of their murder and ends up killing Marty instead.Ray decides to confront Marty only to find him dead with Abby's gun at the scene, so he decides to dispose the body. Ray believes Abby killed Marty and, through miscommunication, doesn't realize that Abby didn't kill Marty.First and foremost, the acting by McDormand, Walsh, and Hedaya is just excellent. Dan Hedaya is almost criminally underrated and plays the creepy bar owner/husband perfectly. Walsh is similarly great as a seedy, oily, used car salesman type.The story starts off interesting, gets a bit slow, then picks up at the end. There's a lengthy scene of Ray disposing of Marty's dead-but-not-dead body that got a bit tiresome.There are also three scenes (at the hotel in the beginning, at Ray's house when Loren takes the pictures, at Ray/Abby's apartment when Loren is sniping) where it could have been easily solved by closing the curtains. The apartment scene was particularly annoying as Ray was so worried about being shot but decides to just walk around when Abby turns on the light and then gets shot.The miscommunication between the two also got a bit frustrating. Ray assumed Abby killed Marty, and so never outright said it, since Abby would have probably said ""Whatch talkin' bout?"" The problem is it felt danced around and not natural.Bottom line, I enjoyed it, loved the acting, had a few issues with the story.",Blood Simple
139,kyle_c,**** out of ****,8,9 September 2002,"Spectacular debut by the Coen brothers is a modern update of a film noir. Superbly directed and written, it is uniformly well acted.  The plot has lots of nice little twists and turns, but never becomes confusing or loses interest.  Any noir fan will love this.",Blood Simple
140,ereinion,Impressive first work from Coen bros,9,6 August 2006,"Deemed as the coldest movie ever, this first feature made by the Coen brothers is a sort of forerunner to ""Fargo"", but in contrast to that film it is completely devoid of humor. Unless you wanna count M. Emmett's remark to the dead Dan Hedaya ""Who looks stupid now?"" as humor. The similarities they both share is the setting, the desolate small town Midwestern one and the exploration of the dark and cold side of the human nature and life.Frances McDormand plays a woman who is bored with her husband, played by Hedaya, and is cheating on him with his own employee, played by John Getz. Getz was completely unknown to me, but I was surprised and pleased by his performance here. Nothing spectacular, but solid. I especially liked the scene where he goes to find his employer and sees that he's dead. His acting there is top notch and that whole scene was incredibly intense and captivating. All credit of course must go to the Coen brothers for that. Although the newcomer McDormand makes a well balanced performance, this film is carried by Walsh and Hedaya. Especially for the first 30 minutes, when they plot to get rid of McDormand and her lover. Those scenes really made me follow the film with greatest anticipation. There are so many surprising and exciting twists to the story that one does not want to part from the screen one minute.This is a very dark and chilling movie and it's not very rewarding apart from the suspense. The deaths are cruel and cold and the ending gives little or none satisfaction, although it is positive. But not entirely. That is what I find great about this film, it leaves you hanging, feeling more confused than satisfied. Just like it is in real life often. I give this strong debut a 9.",Blood Simple

(""I've got places to go, please pretend you don't see me.""), so I kept my distance. I've
never been much of an autograph hound, anyway.If I'd had the chance to speak with her,
though, I would have told her how much I
enjoy 'Blood Simple', her first movie. What a great movie; what a terrific cast.No need for a synopsis of the film, as others

144,jcappy,M. Emmet Walsh,7,26 July 2021,"What makes ""Blood Simple"" stick in my memory are the three scenes between Private Detective Loren Visser (Walsh) and bar owner Julian Marty (Hedaya). Although it's M. Emmet Walsh who strikes the great chord, Dan Hedaya may be a critical catalyst. In any case, their three face to face ""office"" ""appointments"" are loaded up with bristling undercurrents that come from opposing and clashing lives--which are nevertheless, for the moment, interdependent. Both men are riveting in their barely veiled antipathy for the other, but more important, is their undivided attention and their unique presence in real time and space. They are as real as the emanations of their lives and emotions.The same cannot be said for the featured duo of Abby (McDormand) and Ray (Getz). Undoubtedly McDormand, in her own right, would be or is sufficiently compelling, but she and Getz have sort of a TV relationship, or a conventionality which is quite outside M. Emmet Walsh's aura. There's something out of synch, shadowy, muted, too bed-bound, and awkward about their relationship. But, at least they do belong to the success of the movie's first half in that they neither hinder its flow or its rumbling build-up.But the second half of ""Blood Simple"" which begins (my opinion) with Ray's ""corpse"" shock, abdicates both of these character sets. For this is when convincing story telling is displaced by the incorporation of techniques, plot manipulations, horror, thrills, fake suspense, and character depletion. The cogency of the narrative with Walsh and Hedaya occupying its center, is now dismissed as Walsh becomes just another instrumental actor, Hedaya a grotesque ghost, Getz an obtuse plot lackey, and McDormand, a medium of shock and awe. Gone is the authority and mediation of the human dimension. Speech, space, time now seem mostly unreal. And the personal encounters, at the center of the movie--and M. Emmet Walsh himself, have diminished under the glare and gloss of Hollywood.",Blood Simple
145,JesNollie,One of the best of it's kind,9,4 November 2001,"I loved this film.  It had a lot of suspense and style, and the acting was remarkable.  The Coen brothers are truly a phenomenon.  There seems to be no genre of movie they can't do just a little better than most.  This film noir boasts a magnificent cast, and all fit their respective roles perfectly. Full of twists and violence it is a must see for fans of this genre.",Blood Simple
146,Manthorpe,...not so simple.,9,15 November 2004,"What I love about ""Blood Simple."" the most is the intricate detail that the Coen brothers went to to keep you interested as to what is going on and just what will happen next. It's very detailed and technically advanced for a seemingly simple love-story-gone-bad thriller. What's even more enjoyable and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation, not one of them knows the entire story and are left to their own assumptions making ""Blood Simple."" a cut above the rest.This is definitely not a film you want to walk out on for a bathroom break or to grab a smoke, as you will undoubtedly miss something important. These guys have the subtlety nailed right down to the bullet positions in the revolver, literally, and adding nuances and hints here and there that may seem insignificant at the time, but are not. In addition, the cast is all but perfect, Hedaya, McDormand, and most assuredly M. Emmet Walsh give excellently convincing performances, the standout being Walsh without a doubt. I'm used to seeing him in very minor parts, but here he's more significant and is given the chance to shine.....and shine he does.I feel one of the film's major attributes would have to be the environment that it establishes. It's just damn creepy, the music adding more to this tone than in most films, but also the thoughtful cinematography. Some of the shots seem to hold forever, igniting the tension. Even without the long duration of certain shots, the atmosphere is further complimented by the focus of certain small events and objects, hinting the viewer. The small Texas town, the murder, the panic, the assumption, the mystery.....culminating up to a dangerous climate and climax. I felt panicked while watching it. All in all, an insanely clever cult classic worth checking out. Man, my reviews are getting simple due to the fact that I can't write them fast enough.....9/10",Blood Simple
147,movieliker1,This movie is terrible.,2,23 September 2016,"This maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. The characters are all stupid, slow and amoral. Most them stand around for most of the movie doing nothing, with their mouths open. The movie is incredibly slow. The scenery is bleak and unattractive. The music is cheap and unappealing. None of the characters are interesting or appealing. None of them are good people. There is nothing to be learned from this movie. It is not enjoyable or entertaining. And the fact that the characters are so slow makes the movie slow. I often found myself screaming at the screen, ""Do something you freaking idiot !!!"" Nothing --- nothing happens --- nobody moves. They just stand around with their mouths open, doing nothing and saying nothing.One of the main characters ""Ray"" has no affect. He never shows any emotion. No smiles, no happiness, no anger, etc. He just stands around with his mouth open like he is a brain dead zombie. There was never any drama or suspense for me because I didn't care about any of the characters. The movie is incredibly slow and there is this pretentious music playing that is supposed to suggest drama and suspense. But there isn't any because the characters are so slow, uninteresting and unappealing.And they all do terrible things with no understanding of right and wrong. I don't believe any of them are even smart enough to know the difference. It is basically a movie about a bunch of brain dead morons who bumble around and about each other doing terrible things until most of them die.

150,lucianomarzo92,Quite Good,8,12 September 2010,"The Coen Brothers are very gifted film-makers, and this is one of their finest films. Blood Simple takes place in Texas, and is a thriller that tells the story of a woman cheating on her rich husband with an younger guy who is an employee of the husband. The husband finds out about his wife's adulterer, and hires a private detective to kill both of them. The rest of the movie focuses on the relationship of the wife and her adulterer, while they are pursued by the private detective. It is a simple story but it is filmed and directed brilliantly.This movie is not for younger audiences, I wouldn't recommend to anyone under 16 because of the violence. But, it is still a classic that requires at least one viewing. I would definitely watch it many more times. Blood Simple is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen, and is a staple of the Thriller genre. It is one of the most well-crafted, intelligent, creative, and original thrillers I've ever seen.Blood Simple is not a movie with a lot of dialogue, and we don't get to know the characters that well but it has a lot of tension between the characters. Although Blood Simple is very entertaining it has a slower pace than most other thrillers. It doesn't rely on constant action to keep it going, it instead uses a tense atmosphere to keep it suspenseful. The cast does a good job in this movie, especially Dan Hedaya and M. Emmet Walsh who play the husband and the Private Detective.Blood Simple uses visuals and music, to tell the story, instead of dialogue. In fact there are several sections of the movie that are nearly silent except for the music, which by the way Blood Simple has a very good soundtrack. The fact that Blood Simple uses only minimal dialogue makes it a very fun film to watch. You can just soak in the picture and the music without having to hear constant talking.Blood Simple is an artistic film, so it may not be for everybody. If you are like me and enjoy innovative films then you should watch this, but if you prefer the conventional and mostly unoriginal trademarks of most modern Hollywood movies, then this is probably not for you. Blood Simple is a breath of fresh air, it is one of those rare films that is completely original.The Coen Brothers did a great job with this movie. It is a very impressive movie that takes the style of 50's noir and revolutionizes it. I can hardly think of any improvements that could have been made, it could have been just a tad bit longer, but that's about it. Other than that it was an really good film. I believe that it is not only one of the best thrillers I've ever seen, but one of the greatest movies of the 80's.",Blood Simple

152,Supachewy,The First of Many Great Films From the Coen Brothers,7,28 September 2010,"The thriller Blood Simple. is directed by the Coen brothers and stars John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya, and M. Emmet Walsh. The film takes place in modern day Texas.The film starts off with Ray (Getz) and Abby (McDormand) driving in a car. Abby is complaining about her husband Marty (Hedaya) and how she wants to leave him. Abby and Ray then make love in a motel. What they don't know is that they are being photographed by Private Detective Visser (Walsh) for Marty. When Marty sees the photographs of the two making love after a while of consideration he tells Visser that he will pay ten thousand dollars to have his wife and her lover (who happens to be an employee at the bar he owns) killed. This thriller is the first of the Coen brother's career and shows great promise for what is yet to come.The screenplay for this film was very dark and had a touch of comedy in it. It is somewhat of a basic plot but it is done like none of the other ones like it. At some points the film does drag but it is mainly because some of the acting is poor and does not keep me interested. The suspense in this film is great, especially in the final scene. The main characters have very relatable traits but as the film goes on they lose control of themselves and just let the events happening just carry them to the next dramatic moment. A very good first feature script and as we now know the Coens stay around for a long time.The direction for this film was superbly crafted, easily the best part of the film. The first thing I think of is how I love the shot where Marty is sitting at his desk laying back and how the fan is perfectly between his elbows. I just love how that shot is framed. The Coens get some good performances some bad but it is only there first feature so you can't blame them. The suspense in the film is due to them and I am giving them credit for it and I love seeing No Country for Old Men and knowing that they mastered the art of suspense.The acting in this film is overall decent. Francis McDormand and M. Emmet Walsh give very good performances. They make me interested in their characters and make me wait to see them on the screen. But it is basically the exact opposite for Getz and Hedaya. I was entirely bored during the parts when they are on the screen and I could not wait for the scene to end. The only scene where I was not bored with them involved a lot of dirt and a shovel but that is due to the superb direction at that point.Overall I give this film a 7/10, I would have given higher if the acting in total was good. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the Coen brothers or watching a good thriller.",Blood Simple

The acting also works very well with all of this.The only real problem here is not everything stand out as much as being truly powerful and special. Its a unique take on a genre. Done in a way that is particularly important in establishing these new filmmakers. It does, nonetheless, just exist as that. A gente thriller, given a slight twist.

To that add a sprinkling of entertainingly odd camera angles, good editing, and dark humor; and the murderous mayhem slowly unfolds in a very stylistically Coen Bros. manner. In what is almost a Coen Bros. touch in itself, the 1984 time period depicted is dead-on because - it's a 1984 film! Particularly enjoyed watching M.

Twisted but fun. This film has so many twists and turns that just when you think you've seen it all it shocks you again! Dan Hedaya plays Julian Marty, a Texas bar-owner who suspects that his wife Abby (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with Ray (John Getz), one of his employees. So Marty hires a sloppy private detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to follow Abby and Ray. Once Marty finds out that they are in fact having an affair he orders the detective to kill them. But things don't go as planned. The private detective doctors some photos he took of Abby and Ray sleeping to make it look like they had been shot. He shows them to Marty and Marty pays him. Then Marty is killed by the detective. Ray finds the body a couple of hours later and cleans up the mess and takes Marty out in the field to be buried. But before he gets there Marty awakes. He's not dead! But Ray buries him alive anyway. So now Marty is out of the picture. But Abby and Ray still don't know that they're still being followed. The private detective is still intent on killing them. So now Abby and Ray have to fight to stay out of the line of fire and stay alive. I won't give away anymore spoilers but this film was so brilliantly done. Dan Hedaya was excellent. He's usually the main funny guy in a comedy but here he was creepy and dark. You grew to hate him! I loved Frances McDormand and John Getz. I loved their characters. Especially John Getz. He was so sweet. But I think the main star in this film was M. Emmet Walsh. He was extra creepy as the private detective. He was so greasy and sweaty and sloppy and you just knew from the moment you met him that he was gonna screw things up. The direction was perfect in this film. There were so many perfect camera angles that kept you on the edge of your seat. I think this is a wonderful film and anyone, especially Coen Brothers fans, should dig up this unknown little gem. It's a great film! I'm glad I have it in my collection. Thank you for reading my review!",Blood Simple
162,Mr Pants,"Oh, what a tangled web we weave ...",10,16 January 1999,"The soul of film noir was (is) simple deception. The Coen Bros. reveal in their first film just how simple it is to get wrapped up in exponentially-growing deceit. M. Emmett Walsh scores points as one of the creepiest characters ever to crawl out from under any rock. This film demonstrates the Coen Bros. attention to the minutiae of everyday life as it relates to the more lofty topics of murder and attempting to hide said murder. the result is a fascinating study of the limits of human endurance, not the least of which is the use of the excruciating cover of that damn Monkees song!",Blood Simple
163,richard-1967,First and best,10,27 November 2009,"I sometimes think that the Coen Brothers started off with their best movies, then slowly went downhill. Blood Simple has all of their special touches, a wonderful Frances McDormand, a vile M. Emmett Walsh(who does vile-with-a-smile like no other - see The Music of Chance for another example), and their bizarre and violent sense of dark humor.It's not that later Coen Bros. movies are BAD - A Serious Man is a serious redemption - it's that the early movies (Raising Arizona, Miller's Crossing) are so good. And there's that knife in the hand moment....What else, really, was there to say? Blood Simple pretty much said it all.",Blood Simple
164,heywood100,"All Style, No Substance",6,23 January 2003,"The Coen brothers have been making consistently brilliant cinema for almost two decades. Fargo, for example, is a work of genius. Blood Simple, on the other hand, is only decent. This was their debut film, and if it teaches us one thing it's that genius can be learnt.Stylistically, the film is excellent, especially for it's minimal cost. It's dark and moody throughout, with shadows bouncing off everything. The problem arises when you realise that this is the whole film. The plot is quite ridiculously full of holes. Nightclub owner Dan Hedaya hires a hitman (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill his wife (Frances McDormand) and her lover (John Getz), but the hitman double-crosses him, leaves him for dead, and steals his money. When Getz finds him he assumes McDormand has committed the crime and tries to cover up for her. The problem is that no-one seems to have a purpose for doing anything. The characters, if you can call them that, perform their actions simply to further the plot.*****SPOILERS***** Why does the hitman kill happily kill Hedaya but not McDormand and Getz? He gets the $10,000 either way. Why can't Getz bring himself to run over Hedaya, but can easily manage to bury him alive? Why does the hitman return? How does Hedaya survive being buried alive after being shot, and what happens to him? *****SPOILERS END*****Blood Simple is just aching to be a film noir, but doesn't have the plot or characters to go with the impressive atmosphere. This is an admirable first attempt, and the Coens have since gone on to greatness, but Blood Simple certainly isn't the great film it's reputation would have you believe. For a far superior movie about a crime going badly wrong, try Fargo.",Blood Simple
165,Hairy_Lime,Heck of a hello (Spoilers),10,9 February 2004,"This is the Coen Brothers' first film, and in many ways it remains the best; I can still recall the jolt the movie gave me when I first saw it in the theater.  Subsequent movies by the Coens - some excellent - seem to be mannered; here the movie and the cinematic movies seem fresh and exciting.The acting in this movie is fine, with the incomparable M. Emmit Walsh deserving special praise.  But what really sets this movie apart is the uniqueness of the story - the way the characters are constantly making logical assumptions based on the facts known to them but are horribly, fatally, wrong wrong wrong - the way the movie is shot by the Coen brothers. One example: there is a scene when one of the characters is feverishly trying to get rid of a dead - well, almost dead, at any rate - body.  It's night, and the film seems closed in and claustraphobic as the character pulls off the road and buries the body by the car lights.  The next scene is daylight, and the error is plain.And then there is what remains the best scene the Coens have ever shot: one character reaches from an open window in one room to an open window in the next room, and then...oh, oh, I can't go on....",Blood Simple
166,flip304,One of the Coen's best.,10,24 July 2001,"Lately I've been trying to see every single Coen's brother movie. I have seen all but there NEW ones. Like ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". But I had a hard time finding a copy of this film. It was a while before I actually found it to rent. I loved it.      I have alway's loved the Coen's for there PERFECT use of the camera. The can do thing's with the camera that sound stupid. But are actually fascinating (The POV shot of a bowling ball in ""The Big Lebowski""). Joel and Ethan are great directors. Another thing about this film is the fact that everybody has an opinion. Everyone who goes into the back room of the bar leaves thinking something else happened than what really happened. It is quite funny that they wrote it like that.       No one can deny the genious that is the script. It is so aware of itself. Plus, certain scenes go on for 20 minutes without dialogue. And those scenes are more entertaining than the ones with a lot of talking.       I love the film. While a lot more serious than there next films, this is a lot more atmosphere than it is comedy. I like that. 10/10",Blood Simple
167,fiozinho,Knockout!,10,27 August 1999,"A box of fireworks of a picture. The genius of the Bros. shines through here in early, raw form, and is all the better for the lack of pretension that some of their later efforts suffered (e.g. 'Barton Fink') All the performances are spot-on. John Getz (maligned in other comments here) is actually very good in his portrayal of a bland everyman drawn into a situation that becomes increasingly beyond his control. You can almost smell the oozy M. Emmet Walsh! But what most catches you is the sheer audacity of some of the set pieces. The newspaper on the screen door. The bullet holes in the wall. This film is packed with 'wrap 'em up, I'll take 'em home' images. A gas!",Blood Simple
168,moviekid-2,The Bizarre world of the coens,10,15 June 2001,"Wow! This is a film that you will make you overwhelmed when the movie fades out and the credits come up. In a way, this film is sort of like Fargo, only with a twist. In Fargo, guy hires two idiots to kidnap wife for insurance. Here, guy hires a guy to kill his wife and his lover because of the wife's infidelity. This is the Coen's first film and I don't blame them. I am a huge fan of the Coens and after watching this, I have seen all of the Coens film. The film had a sophoric feel that will sort of leave goose bumps on your arm, even at the end. All of the actors in that film gave superb performance, especially M. Emmet Walsh as the private eye. He was chilling and yet he did it great. He is one of these characters that will show up in a bad dream. That's how most of the Coens films are: surreal. Anyway, see it. It's a great movie. Recommended.",Blood Simple
169,mhoney-1,"A truly edgy, morbid, disturbing, and terrific film",10,31 March 2003,"The Coen Brothers' first movie catapulted them to stardom and won at the Sundance Film Festival its first year. The story of jealousy, greed, and murder seems to be an old formula, but not when it's done like this it isn't! Part suspense film noir and part horror, ""Blood Simple"" is the story of a detestible, vomiting bartender played with expert sleaze by Dan Hedaya, who has employed obnoxious and rude private detective M. Emmet Walsh to find out if his wife, Frances McDormand is sleeping with someone. When he discovers his wife is sleeping with an employee, John Getz, who Hedaya owes money to for work, he offers Walsh $10,000 to kill the two of them. What follows is a series of events involving the disappearance of the bartender, the psychopathic tendencies of the private detective, the guilt and displaced loyalty of the lover, and the utter cluelessness of the wife. It is not always easy to watch, but this is certainly a movie that pulls at the stomach and often surprises the viewer.",Blood Simple
170,stancym-1,Put me in a bad mood that I had to shake off,1,22 March 2018,"The whole thing did not make sense. The way everyone seemed to make decisions seemed extremely unlikely and far fetched without the necessary humor to make that work. I agreed with the reviewer who stated that one is unlikely to bury a body in an open field with a lit up house not far away. Especially with tire tracks leading to the scene. Then there is the matter of the husband who hires a sleazy detective to kill his wife and her lover. He is shot apparently dead, certainly bleeding a LOT, and we are supposed to believe he suddenly comes to life after hours of not moving and after hours of being dragged away from the murder scene in a car, all the while not moving? Suddenly he has the energy to get out of the car, crawl in the road, and start firing shots at the wife's lover to boot? and wait, he's dragged some more and dumped in a pit dug by the lover, and he is still alive enough to fire MORE shots? As for the leads, the lovers, how did these two ever get together? They tell each other NOTHING, explain NOTHING, and have no communication or affection of any kind in the whole movie. You really dont LIKE any character in this film, and for some that may not matter. It did to me. There is no humor to lighten this dark, depressing piece, and there was too much stupidity for me. Disagreeable and distasteful film. FARGO is a far superior film.",Blood Simple
171,Klaatu-18,Classic film noir,9,29 November 2003,"When I discover a new director or actor (or writer for that matter), I get that double-whammy of enjoyment. First, because I have a new name (or, in this case, names) that I can look for in the credits. But, secondly, it means that I can then turn to the films already in the vault (or previous books).Anyone familiar with the Cohen brothers' movies knows that they are populated with vivid characters with strong emotions and goals. The only thing that they have in common is their stylishness.In this movie, Joel and Ethan dip into the film noir genre. At it's core, the movie tells about a jealous husband (Dan Hedaya) who hires a private detective (M. Emmett Walsh) to find out if his wife has been cheating.What follows is a tragic series of misunderstandings and a fatal double-cross. To say much more would spoil too much of the plot. Suffice it to say that, in classic film noir fashion, few survive and those who do will remember the experience forever.For students of film, this is a treasure as well. It shows how to do a movie on a small budget but without looking cheap. The DVD is loads of fun, too. It starts with an opening sequence from some bogus film preservation society in which a windbag talks a lot, but says little. Here is ""Blood Simple"", fully restored ""with all the boring parts"" removed.But wait! He isn't finished yet. If you switch on the commentary, you get this same guy. And he's the worst ""film historian"" you could hope for. The comments he makes are ill-informed at best, and completely off-the-wall stupid at the worst. Amusing,yes. But, honestly, I could only take ten or fifteen minutes of it.Movie 9 stars. Commentary: one-half star (if that).",Blood Simple

A perfect mix of tension, betrayal and tragedy with a climax that would make Hitchcock jealous.",Blood Simple

The angels, perspectives, the film's noir style lights an shadows takes the breath away. It's the story that baffles me.

This movie has limited number of dialogues but the tense atmosphere,neo- noir feel,style of photography and score makes it a great start for most promising brother film makers. There are so many scenes which takes you to the edge of the seat. It's violent and shockingly funny. All starts with a woman cheating on his husband with his employee and a clownish as much as creepy private investigator. It gives us a simple story to follow from the starts but it gets more and more thrilling and interesting as the movie moves forward. Full of Jaw-clenching sequences ,it is filled with blood,crime,cheat,love misunderstanding and horror. It has a slow pace but you really start to dig in after few minutes.

Well, I guess I was expecting more when I got to the end.  The point is:  Don't go into this film expecting a Sixth Sense surprise ending.  Expect nothing and it's quite a good film.  Pace-wise, it takes a while to get started, but the last half of the film flows well.  The moments of suspense are truly gripping.  The acting by then relatively-unknowns are on the mark.  My favorite parts about this film though are the cinematography and Carter Burwell's atmospheric score.Also to consider, there's a point early in the film where Marty chats with a woman at the bar, and the subject of poor communication briefly comes up. It won't seem too relevant at the time, but keep that conversation in mind as you watch the film.. and everything will make sense.",Blood Simple
178,crystalart,A favorite Cohn Brothers' film,10,16 January 2010,"""Blood Simple"" has the 'Alfred Hitchock effect' when I watch it. It leads you to fear what is about to happen, then it teases you unmercifully and makes you want to squint your eyes like a little kid.There's enough fantasy to keep you guessing. It will you at least two viewings of this film to really appreciate it.As the years have gone by, I have watched more and more of the Cohn Brother's work and have found it excellent.""Blood Simple"" wears very well. I watched it again tonight and found it totally enjoyable. It's possibly Dan Hedaya's best role, although I enjoyed him in ""The Addam's Family"" and ""Commando"", too.Any film by the Cohn Brothers will always have a place in my collection.",Blood Simple
179,zaremskya-23761,"Simple film, but the C. Bros have begun.",7,3 February 2017,"The Cohen Brothers' first major feature has all the elements that make a Cohen Brothers movie what it is - dastardly characters, witty dialogue, dark humor, a smart script; it's just that the movie is film-school quality and the actors don't know they're working with legends so they aren't on top of their game.The film follows a murder ordered by a jealous husband, and the plot gets tangled up in betrayal, revenge, and mistrust. It is a classic noir construction with dark edges around the characters and their motives. The pace of the film is languid and slow, as with most noirs, except it can make the film seem tired.The Cohen Brothers seem to love westerns, as many of their films are set out there and if not, have traces of its influence either in the characters or story. I don't know how many Jewish cowboys there were, but the Cohens love to live out their wild and violent fantasies on screen and play around with these ideas.Cohen fans should definitely see Blood Simple. It will give them context and perspective to how these master filmmakers came into their style and craft. Noir fans will also enjoy the gritty and dark subject material.A decent film, but disappointing to me, simply because I've been spoiled rotten by Cohen gold all these years.",Blood Simple
180,cinema_lover97,A tale of misunderstandings and paranoia,8,18 August 2020,"The world saw the debut of four great talents in the history of cinema with this film. The phenomenal director duo the Coen Brothers, acting legend Frances McDormand, and renowned music composer Carter Burwell. Can also include Barry Sonnenfeld as this was only his third project, previously he had just worked on a documentary and a TV movie. Together they created Blood Simple., the finest debut film a director could hope of making.The idea of hate and violence making a person simple and hinder his/her ability to make rational decisions in critical situations is executed very well. Nobody can go and commit murder and stay sane afterward, it's not possible. The person loses his mind and starts seeing every situation and person through a lens of suspicion and fear. Here, the bar owner's jealousy and hate towards his wife and her lover drive him mad to the extent of calling a hit on them. He and the private investigator takes every precaution in the book to avoid getting caught. However, when deceit enters the mind of the investigator, he tries something funny and it changes the lives of the characters forever.The screenplay by the Coen Brothers is fantastic. Every dialogue and the turn of events works very well surprisingly (considering it was their first work), and doesn't feel out of place. The opening monologue sets the nature and tone of the movie perfectly. Characters remain unaware of the truth and carry different pieces of information in their mind. It gives rise to misunderstandings between them and tragedy follows. The one line a certain person says to another to expect to hear, he hears it again and the little ounce of trust between the acquaintances gets thrown out of the window, and it remains till the very end. The signature humor of the Coen Brothers is present in some scenes, but all-around the film tone is serious.The performances are engaging and believable. M. Emmet Walsh is clearly the standout, playing a sleazy, sweaty, joke-cracking P.I. He seems harmless in the beginning but his actions prove otherwise. Frances McDormand is also good in her debut performance. Highlights of this movie for me are undoubtedly the editing, cinematography, and sound design. The camera movements mixed with clever and seamless editing gave me several moments when I rewound scenes to take in the beauty of them. The highway sequences captured the bleakness of the landscape and the hopelessness in the characters perfectly. I watched the director's cut in which the sounds were supposedly restored. The gun going off in the bar owner's office got my heart beating fast, the same goes for the whole climax, the gun-shot sounds were stress-inducing.Giving it 8/10 only because I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters, and some scenes felt tiresome and uninteresting.",Blood Simple
181,Dr. Nick*#3,"Simple, very effective movie",8,2 July 1999,"Blood simple is a good movie marred by a bland lead performance. I thought I wouldn't like it since, even though the Coens are genius storytellers, the movie is 14 years old. It doesnt have the absurdist touches and brilliant straightfaced comedy that later Coen movies have but the way they make the act of killing a man(ONE man, no less) so disturbing and agonizing to watch is a testament to their ability to reach out and provoke the soul of the audience if they want to. The characters they create always register as real, breathing human beings, no matter how likeable they are.(except the lead character- he was REALLY stupid in his handling of the body and his behavior after the murder. On top of that, the guy who played him sucked) Hats off to Dan Hedaya(who knew) for creating such a flawed but real character. Frances McDormand didn't give a particularly powerful performance but she was solid nonetheless.  The movie didn't give her much to say, unfortunately. M Emmet Walsh was perfectly slimy as the detective- the movie should have concentrated more on him and the jilted husband and the wife instead of training the camera on the lead actor's perplexed expressions and monosylabbic mumbling. Other than that it was very original and wasnt predictable at all(very uncharacteristic of 80's murder dramas) and I give it a marginal thumbs up(as if anybody cares)",Blood Simple

To me he played his character stupid. M Emmitt Walsh was excellent and Frances McDormand was great especially this was her first film.

186,Adec,Cold but stylish...,7,8 September 1999,"Blood Simple is a curious film and despite it's many benefits it's a hard film to enjoy. Stylishly directed by Joel Coen and with a good, tight script by Joel and his brother Ethan, technically it can't be faulted, especially considering it's very low budget. However despite it's obvious style and solid production the whole film just comes across as too detached to be completely satisfying or enjoyable.It's this detachment that makes it all come across as somewhat cold and distant, and because of that there's no real investment in the characters or what happens to them. As things unfold you just sit there not really caring about what horrors are going to befall them, still interested in the film but just not connected to it. Acting wise it's a bit of a mixed bag, although there are no outright poor performances to speak of. Frances McDormand and M. Emmet Walsh are both very good in their roles, while John Getz and Dan Hedaya both giving strong, grounded performances and Samm-Art Williams and Deborah Neuman both passable enough in support (though hardly inspiring). The main problem with the performances are that none of the characters are very appealing, and as I've said that makes the actors and the film itself feel relentlessly cold at times. Still for what they did they did it well enough.On the more technical side of things theres a good, suitably moody score (an essential for quality noir) by Carter Burwell that sets the scene effectively, while the cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld is also impressively handled.Blood Simple is a good, quality thriller that does what it does very well and with style but just may be a little too distant and detached for many viewers. That said this is a solidly acted and made film with more than enough twists, turns and surprises to carry it through to it's conclusion and as such is still well worth checking out.7.5/10 One Man's Opinion.",Blood Simple

188,acromegalix,A movie I can watch again and again,9,3 May 2017,"I saw Blood Simple in 1984 and it became immediately one of my favorite movies. I watched it a lot of times since and always found new subtleties at each viewing. Though it could maybe bore people that are used to more mainstream Coen movies, Blood Simple is a remarkable piece of indie art, with a surprising maturity for a first try. Every shot, every editing, every line, every set is skillfully designed with an obvious talent that transcends the classic Noir mainframe. With its hypnotizing pace and music, it delivers a really original experience that gets better and better with time. Even if their later work was always OK (even if I'm really not a fan of their burlesque approach of comedy) the Coen brothers have never been more inspired and inventive than on their three first movies.

189,miaharpr,More a dark comedy than noir,8,17 September 2019,"I think if you were expecting a thriller that adheres to genre conventions, this film might rub you the wrong way. I didn't know what to expect coming into it, and I only found out the brothers directed it when the credits rolled. That said, now it makes sense why some scenes that were meant to be gritty had a comedic undertone to them. Bearing in mind the events that unfolded in the movie, ""Blood Simple"" as the title just makes one chuckle at the irony that it was anything but. It was a case of irrational behaviour combined with misunderstandings that complicated an otherwise easy contract killing. I found myself shaking my head and yelling at the screen (""why didn't you double check, man?"") a couple of times. It's definitely a movie with flaws, but I can personally look past them because whatever the film lacked in plot development it made up for with mood and picture quality. There were a handful of memorable frames in this movie, primarily when Marty was crawling away from the car and it's just his silhouette we see, or that bird's eye view of Marty lifeless in the chair. As a side note, Mcdormand's acting was pretty solid in this, and as a whole the movie is still relevant. It aged well.",Blood Simple
190,Absyrd,A surprisingly hard-boiled thriller,9,1 July 2008,"This is one of the Coen Brother's darkest films, and we all know their films are usually laced with humor. Characters here exchange several awkward jokes, but its actual atmosphere is brooding and merciless. Its themes revolve around paranoia and guilt to an almost surreal extent, stirring up a setting of tragedic exposure.The film begins with poignant, but hopeful undertonic deceivement. Howver, all glimmer of hope is erased when a man, whose wife has been cheating on him, hires a hit-man to kill her and her lover. That's when I realized that this wasn't the light, humorous Coen film mixed with thriller elements, but the truly dark and restrained side of Coen's three-dimensional talent. Of course, in the film, the seemingly simple plan goes horribly wrong, and all parties are interweaved with tragic aftermath. Giving away any more plot would just ruin this experience, so I'll keep you hanging.It all results in an intense, suspenseful climax. None of the characters are shown mercy, nor do the Coens' kill them off with ignorant lack of remorse, but they show us how revenge and satisfaction never coincide, nor does betrayal without atonement. Performance, editing, and script-wise, the film never lets up in being an engaging, absolutely captivating study of human nature.****",Blood Simple
191,Hanichi,Good example of what happens when the Coens do something right,8,25 July 1999,"I have to say that I might enjoyed this film more had I seen it when it first came out, instead of after I saw Fargo.  The two films share themes and subject matter, and hence this film does not have the same freshness it might have had seeing it for the first time back in 1984.  Many of the techniques that the Coen's use in this film they and others have used since in other films, so they don't have as much impact.  That being said, this is a very good film.  Like Fargo, the characters seem to be very simple people who make stupid mistakes and then make stupid mistakes trying to cover up previous mistakes, in an ever downward spiral.  Yet this makes the film more authentic.  Few people, when under great stress, are at their best intellectually.",Blood Simple
192,thomas.meagher,"Slow into the mid-term, builds to an interesting climax",6,8 May 2000,"A film best reserved for Coen brother fans.  It will also be of interest to those who enjoyed Fargo.

193,happygoluckyduck,"On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974).",9,6 February 2010,"Review:The Coen Brother's ""Blood Simple"" has all the trappings we've come to associate with a Coen brothers' film. It would appear this, their first film, has served as the prototype for the great films to come. In ""Blood Simple"" we have the wide open country (""No Country for Old Men""), portentous headlights emerging from the night (""Fargo"") we have ominous ceiling fans (""Barton Fink"") and terrible deaths (""Miller's Crossing"") and of course, we have a simple crime that goes terribly wrong (""Raising Arizona,"" ""Fargo,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""No Country,"" ""Burn After Reading"").I should now confess that the Coen Brothers always rub me the right way. Their quirkiness and defiance of expectations send tingles down my spine that put me in a good mood, no matter how peculiar the material. Just like with Kubrick, Woody Allen, Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, and Fellini I can always find something to like in their films.""Blood Simple"" starts off like so many other movies and then diverts and meanders into a plot that's hard to see coming but easy enough to follow. Marty (Dan Hedaya), a jealous bar owner, hires Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh), a private detective of questionable moral integrity, to spy on his wife Abby (Frances McDormand). Abby is having an affair with one of Marty's employees, Ray (John Getz). When Visser informs Marty of Abby's infidelity, Marty hires him to kill the lovers. He offers Visser ten thousand dollars and it is an offer Visser can't turn down. That is the set up and to elaborate any more on the plot would be a disservice to the film - except to say that Visser has a plan of his own.In some ways, this film reminded me of Sam Raimi's ""A Simple Plan"" (1998) (coincidentally the Coen's got their start working for Raimi). Both films are about how a series of independently motivated actions can add to a complete and encompassing massacre. I suppose for that matter, ""Fargo"" and ""No Country"" are that way too.But as with all Coen brothers what makes this movie so good is the particulars of the camera-work and the oddities of the characters. The camera glides all over, sometimes smoothly, sometimes rough, sometimes along the floor or a street, and other times at eye level. It takes on strange yet affecting angles, like underneath a sink looking up or above a ceiling fan looking down.M. Emmet Walsh as Visser comes off as a striking villain. He sometimes seems a simpleton, which makes us like him, and sometimes a vicious killer, which makes us fear him. One of his greatest amusements in life seems to be a toy woman, dangling from his rear view mirror, who's breasts light up when turned on. Can such an easily amused man be a ruthless killer? You bet.""Blood Simple,"" for a first film is impressive. It is beyond apprentice work. While the Coens would go on to make better, even stranger movies, ""Blood Simple"" has a memorable quality all its own.Rating:On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974).Rationalization:Well, sometimes people just make bad decisions. I didn't mention much about the main character Ray in the review, but suffice it to say, he makes a very bad decision in ""Blood Simple"" – one that will change the rest of his life and the course of this movie. The scenes in which he makes this decision are the best scenes in the film, wrought with suspense, horror, and evocative pity. We understand why Ray does it, but stillIt makes you think that God just likes to mess with some people.",Blood Simple
194,ZildjianDFW,Strong Debut from the Coens,9,29 December 2010,"This film, the first from Joel and Ethan Coen, seems sort of like the odd man out in the Coens' oeuvre. In a catalog of work virtually unique for its surrealism, its wit, its eccentricity, its blending of genres, this film seems in many ways surprisingly straight-forward. But nonetheless, the Coen craft is already in full potency, and their eye for the grotesque already well trained.Marty (Dan Hedaya), owner of a successful Texas bar, suspects his wife (Frances McDormand) of cheating on him with one of his bartenders, Ray (John Getz). He hires a seedy private detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to investigate, setting into motion a chain of events that will, predictably enough for anyone familiar with the Coens' work, lead to bloodshed and bungling criminality, though with none of the humor that marks their own films.The film is dark, violent, and disturbing, a taut, suspenseful, impactful thriller. The script is exceptional, feature clever dialogue and avoiding many of the tropes and pitfalls many neo-noirs doom themselves to by lack of imagination. The cinematography, by Barry Sonnenfeld, is extraordinary, indicating not only Sonnenfeld's skill, but the Coens' eye for landscape and haunting imagery. The music, written by Carter Burwell in the first of many fruitful collaborations with the brothers, is understated but spot-on; the alternation between classics like ""It's the Same Old Song"" by the Four Tops, and Burwell's own music, much of it for piano, is effective and memorable.The acting is only slightly a mixed bag. John Getz is a tad stiff in the movie, perhaps intentionally so, though he excels at conveying a sense of numbness later in the film. Frances McDormand is competent, but we don't yet see the brilliance that brought her an Oscar in ""Fargo"". Dan Hedaya plays a variation of his usually sleazy character, which is just what is needed for the film. The standout is Walsh, whose performance is fantastic.For any Coen, this film is a must see, and it surely stands as one of the strongest directorial debuts of its generation. But even the passing movie goer, this film is worth a shot. It's a film you won't soon forget. Highly recommended.",Blood Simple
195,the dude-3,The definition of dark comedy,10,23 January 2000,"Warning: Spoiler!  There's one particular scene in this film that for me defines the term ""dark comedy"" and much of what the Coen brothers are.  After the character played by John Getz has found a dead Dan Hedaya and assumed his lover Frances McDormand has committed the crime, he sloppily tries to cover it up.  First he tries to mop up all the blood with a handtowel, making the process all the more slow.  Then, he puts the body in his back seat, ignoring the fact that it's still heavily bloodied.  While driving down a quiet country road, he suddenly hears moaning from the back seat and does the logical next step: slams on the brakes, opens the door and runs as far away from the car as he can.  After waiting several minutes and catching his breath, he walks cautiously back to the car and looks inside, but the body's no longer in the back seat.  He walks around to the opposite side, the door is open, and a bleeding and nearly dead Dan Hedaya is slowly crawling, quite futilely, down the dark road.  Getz panics due to the morbid site, and figures he must finish him off.  So, he gets out a shovel to hit him with, but no, that's too gruesome. So, he gets in his car and prepares to run him over, but can't do that either and to his despair, another car is coming down the road.  So, he drags Hedaya out of the car's view and out into the desolate field, where he proceeds to dig a whole while Hedaya lies half-dead nearby.  After the hole is dug, he puts Hedaya in, and begins to bury him, alive.  Hedaya makes one last attempt to save himself and pulls a gun he had on him, but he doesn't have the strength to pull the trigger and is buried completely. Getz sits next to the grave and frustratedly hits the yet-moving pile of dirt.  Now, this shouldn't be at all funny, but it isn't just funny, it's hysterical.  This to me proves the genius of the Coen Brothers team and defines the term ""dark comedy""",Blood Simple
196,Andy-140,A brilliant debut!,8,21 December 1998,"'Blood Simple' is not as great a masterpiece as 'Fargo' but it is interesting to look at the visual similarities of both films. In particular the road scenes remind me of the shots of Brainerd and also the scene where the body of Marty is dragged out of the sight of an approaching lorry is like a scene in 'Fargo'. The Coens are particularly adept at showing the fragility of people against the natural environment - Minnesota (Fargo), Bernie in the woods (Miller's Crossing) and the bare Texas farmland (Blood Simple).The Coen brothers are brilliant at depicting very ordinary people getting into situations that get out of hand. 'Blood Simple' is a great film that still stands the test of time.",Blood Simple
197,george-102,Film Dire,1,18 April 2000,"This film is, if it's about anything, about murder. We are shown a sequence of murders.  Unfortunately the motives for these murders all seem wholly unconvincing and inadequate. I do not think the majority of people are likely to murder for trifling reasons, even in Texas.  I suppose the many admirers of this film like watching all the goo when people are murdered or trapped in gruesome ways. Personally I find it boring.  I'm not even in the least horrified, since the plot is so contrived, and all I think is ""Oh yeah, another special effect"".  I don't know why this film is called film noir; there is more noir in a typical episode of Tom and Jerry.",Blood Simple

In this intricate and original thriller, Hedaya hires private detective Walsh to kill his unfaithful wife and her lover. But it doesn't go quite as expected. The whole movie is gripping and darkly humorous until the climax. One of my favorite actresses is Frances McDormand, and she's great in this, as she is in almost any film she's in.

200,seraf,Dark existentialism,8,24 September 2005,"The Coens' first feature effort is about escalating mayhem stemming from an act of marital infidelity. Walsh is the deceptively ruthless private eye; Hedaya is the restive and hapless cuckold; Getz is the thick and hapless lover; McDormand is the wife with a deceptively strong survival instinct. This is a film where acting plays second fiddle to the story, with characters being mere pawns driven towards their respective fates by the grim, implacable plot. The script is frugal and flawless with the kind of personality that will appear in the Coens' later work. The music is fairly successful in setting the tone of the film, which is one of dark existentialism.

Deserted highways, long scenes and silences rather that yabbering filler. If you see this, give in and rent it. You'll be nodding your head and saying how you forgot how great Blood Simple is.

Blood Simple has its moments, the intro for instance, is awesome, but overall i think much of it is poorly written and poorly acted. While some people say it's an 'amazing debut' or whatever, it's pretty obvious to me that it really is what it is - Coens' debut. The fact that some experience was missing really shows.It's funny how all the pretentious reviewers here constantly wanna emphasize on how much they're the real deal by claiming Blood Simple to be much better than the more popular Coen flicks, when in fact, they probably wouldn't even give it a chance if it your excluded the name Coen as directors/writers. I would have taken it as just a matter of differing opinions, but it's pretty obvious to me where it's coming from when there's barely any substance in all the positive remarks.

However, the detective turns the tables on the owner as he kills him for the money, figuring he could pin the murder on the couple by using the wife's handgun. However, the bartender discovers the body first, suspects the wife, and tries to get rid of the body for her. If it wasn't such a thriller, it could actually be a black comedy.

205,bross3,Try to watch this without talking to the characters...,8,21 April 2000,"I think this film, probably more than any other, causes me to talk to the characters on the screen in an exasperated way--something akin to the way you want to yell at the characters in a slasher movie not to run outside to investigate sounds.The only difference is that this film is fantastic, whereas cheap slasher movies are not.  Blood Simple is emotionally involving and the suspense is played to perfection.  While the characters are completely clueless as to what has gone on around them, we know everything.  What we don't know is what the characters are going to do next.  As in every Coen film, things quickly get out of control.  Some people have commented that the characters here acted unbelievably, but I'd have to say that when you think about their situations, the reactions are completely compatible with the way the characters are set up.  The problem is that nobody knows what's going on except the viewers.Coen fans will notice many recurring themes from their other films (especially Fargo and The Big Lebowski) such as the use of headlights, passing motorists witnessing a crime, shower curtains and bathroom windows, detectives driving VW beetles, husbands hiring the wrong people to carry out a crime... I had a longer list in mind earlier while watching it but I've forgotten some.

Also the journey into abysmal characters of human beings allow unsettled parallels to ""Fargo"". A astounding attractive Frances McDormand in her first part gives her film character tender-hearted veracity the whole movie.

210,LoganPa,Not so Simple,4,5 April 2002,"Blood simple is great in many ways, but unfortunately, not in all. The direction is superb. It has that distinctive Cohen taste to it. I loved the use of sounds to create quite a unique mood. The storyline was intricate enough, but the dialogue itself, or the lack thereof was disappointing. The characters are boringly SIMPLE and the filmmakers pretend that the audience will feel for them when there is nothing to feel really. The movie has no heart or drive of itself, it squeaks by with the wonderful shots J. Cohen provides us, but that just doesn't do it for me.Considering this movie to be the Cohen brothers' first movie, I would say it suffers from a lot of immature moviemaking. For example, Dan Hedaya's character could have been developed into a wonderful character( he's cut out for these roles) but instead he is reduced to pouting and mumbling moody remarks. Also McDormand's and Getz's characters are just moving emotionless through the picture like robots. Walsh's character was the only fully developed and defined character in the film and a very well portrayed too. All of these errors would not have been overlooked by an experienced director or producer. All in all it is high standard filmmaking and somewhat remarkable effort for first-timers.On a high standard scale I would give this movie a 4 out of 10. All four points attributed to the excellent directing by Joel Cohen.",Blood Simple

As usual I got this from Netflix and you know what this has to be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Emmet Walsh, Frances McDormand ( a very young Frances McDormand, mind you) and Dan Hedaya combine for what is mostly a basic story, with some of the best twists and turns I've seen in a movie in a long time. Jon Getz never had it so good.As far as the DVD transfer is concerned, this is truly why all great movies need to go to the lab first and leave Perfect Strangers the Lost Season on the shelf.

212,stickbob123,A Fantastic Start for the Coens.,10,27 April 2014,"The Coen brothers' debut; a neo-noir, slightly stylized, low budget crime film. What's not to love? This movie is easily comparable to movies like ""The Raid: Redemption"" and ""Reservoir Dogs."" Not in terms of content or style, but in terms of directorial mindset--when a director has a lot to prove, a desperately low budget, and a handful of good actors, truly amazing things can happen. This movie doesn't waste a second, and it packs in a complex character-interaction based plot, fantastic dialogue, beautiful transitions and cinematography, and tension that's on par with Hitchcock all into a running time that's barley over 90 minutes. The movie doesn't meander once, and I think the Coen's have the desperation of a low budget to thank for that. They only had $2 million and they made sure all of it went to good use. Every character in this movie is at once detestable and wholly likable, and the Coens achieve this mostly by presenting the characters' terrible acts and then glossing over them with their now iconic dark, quirky humor. A witty joke can make a murderer seem like someone you'd want to be friends with. Really it's all about these characters that the Coens have created and the way they interpret one-another, themselves, and the situations they find themselves in. The way it unfolds is poetic. Not only one of my favorite neo-noirs (bested only by ""Blade Runner,"" ""Chinatown,"" and ""Drive), but this is one of my favorite film noirs in general. Just go watch it.

Let me explain: When McDormand first puts the gun in her purse, a closeup clearly shows that it's a Smith & Wesson, a revolver that is loaded by swinging the cylinder out to the side.Later, when Walsh sneaks into the house and steals a revolver, he breaks it open to see if it's loaded. This is a break-action revolver, most probably a Harrington & Richardson (we get a much better look at it later in the film.) This is the gun that Walsh uses to shoot Hedaya, (and also the one that magically fires itself when Getz accidentally kicks it.) Throughout the movie, I thought this inconsistency was deliberate, and was very disappointed to find that it was just a blunder on the part of the movie crew! (Also, the ""goofs"" section of IMDb on this film has some nonsense about a revolver with a ""cocking lever;"" this is apparently written by someone with no more knowledge of revolvers than the film crew. Revolvers do not have ""cocking levers,"" except maybe for some rare antique.) Sorry to seem a nit-picker, but I expect crime films to be consistent.

220,nlappos,Simply told yields excellent results,7,24 October 2001,"Nobody tells a story so whimsically like the Coen brothers.  Though I think ""FARGO"" is still their best film to date, ""BLOOD SIMPLE"" is an excellent entry into the neo-noir Hitchcock hall of homage.  The trailer even features a quote from Hitchcock which relates the difficulties associated with pulling off a homicide.Any film with a handful of characters that can tell a compelling story rank among my favorites.  And this is yet another shining example.  Although I felt it moved too slow at times, with wide shots of endless, deserted Texas highway - it still kept a pulse vital enough to sustain it as a mystery/thriller/neo-noir solid *** star film.Dan Hedaya has never been better.  Here, he's the disgruntled husband, running a seedy Texas bar, who wants only to have some kind of closure with his wife - be it an apology or a slap on the wrist.  He seems to be the kind of guy who thinks himself a failure and it's more than obvious when he looks at a black and white photograph of both he and his then happy wife Abby (Francis McDormand).Whether he couldn't please her financially or keep 'up' his end of the marital bargain, it's obvious their marriage is over.  Even though he still loves her, he's willing to murder her moronic boyfriend Ray because he resents her ignorance towards him even more.Ray makes the mistake of hiring the snickering, obese self-proclaimed private eye Visser (M. Emmet Walsh), who's own narration describes him as a loner who looks out only for his own gain.Much like FARGO, the Coen brothers examine how human relations deteriorate when it comes to the greed associated with money.  The also show how completely stupid those who commit violent crimes can be.  Like most of their films this also has a foundation in human trust and how it can be manipulated and distorted.  Films are made on those things alone, but BLOOD SIMPLE takes it that one step farther beyond rationality, when vengeance or greed becomes the only goal no matter the consequences.As it progresses everything becomes BLOODY and COMPLICATED, while the plot remains marvelously easy to follow and superbly tense.  It's not perfect, but it does the job.  This is most certainly a must for Coen fans and suspense-thriller fans alike.  Though the film lacks the impact of the sardonic humor from their other films, it makes up for it in raw intensity.Until next time, On the Ball, Off the Rock, and very Low-Key",Blood Simple

225,GideonPope,Garbage packaged as Art,3,30 December 2007,"SPOILERS EVERYWHERE . . .I gave this movie a 3 because, unlike some other flicks by these guys, I didn't find the movie unwatchable - I just found it incredibly dull.In about 20 or 30 years a new generation of movie watchers will pick up this movie, and others from the Brothers, and will wonder, ""geez, out parents must have been completely insane.""Like when you look back at original Dragnet episodes and you practically pee yourself they're so stupid. But back in the 50s they were considered spectacular.This move was terrible. There seems to be a contingent of people out there who see a movie like this and find artsy reasons to like it. They like the camera angles, the ""cinematography"", the ""noir"", and other words that have nothing to do with the story itself.If that's your idea of a great film, then you might love this film.My idea of a great film is - a great story told well.This story was silly. The story was, ironically, simple. Too simple. While the writers seemed to have strained to make the story intricate, it was about as intricate as a Scooby Doo episode.Here is the story in about 5 sentences - Bar owner's wife sleeps with Bar owner's bartender. Bar owner attempts to hire local hick to kill bartender and wife. Hick only pretends to kill bartender and wife, and then, after collecting the money, kills bar owner. Bartender finds body of bar owner and thinks wife did it, and so bartender tries to hide the bar owner's body. Unfortunately, the Bar owner is not dead, so bartender buries him alive. Hick comes back to try to kill bartender and wife to recover evidence linking himself to bar owner's murder, but instead only kills bartender - wife survives. The End. Thank you - I saved you a few bucks and a few hours.The bar owner is Carla's husband from Cheers - a HORRIBLE actor, and not convincing as the burned husband. The bartender is not interesting. The wife, who was great in Fargo, was so-so. The Texas hick played the part fine, it just was not interesting.In sum, I was not surprised or impressed by any part of the movie. The plot was silly and impossible, the characters were boring and behaved irrationally from start to finish, and the murders were stupid and uninteresting.Further, there is only about a gallon of blood in the human body. The bar owner lost about 15 gallons of blood in the horribly slow 40 minutes that he was dying and then being buried alive.Further, bartender buries bar owner in the middle of a plowed farm field. They keep showing a shot from a helicopter of the car in the middle of the dirt field. This must have been one of the great artsy moments that I didn't appreciate. What I did appreciate was how ridiculously asinine it would be for a criminal to drive two tire tracks to the middle of a plowed field, bury a body, and then drive away, with a farm house a few hundred yards away. I mean how long would it be before the farmer got curious and followed the tracks to the place where there's a bunch of footprints and a 6' hand dug area? I mean, DUH? That right there is stupid as all get out. People bury bodies in the woods for a reason.This movie was too dumb to be interesting. The story was simple, the acting, so so, and the artsy stuff that so many people seem to thing made this movie something more than a borderline B-movie murder non-mystery - it evades me completely - I guess I must just not be artsy enough.",Blood Simple
226,rossrjensen,well put together,9,10 September 2003,"Blood Simple was finely put together by the Coen brothers.  What I really loved is how the Coens showed certain objects, kind of foreshadowing its future involvement in the film.  While the story wasn't anything spectacularly original, it was very well written and put together.  I think any fan of films should check out Blood Simple, because it is a great representation of how a film should be created.",Blood Simple
227,NirvanaWi,How would this rate without the 'Coen' name attached?,7,1 September 2020,"Overall, Blood Simple was an entertaining enough movie. Definitely slower-paced throughout the majority of the movie, and a film with a low amount of dialogue. The acting was decent, and I always have had a liking for how grimy and sinister E. Emmet Walsh can play a bad guy role. There weren't really too many suprises plot-wise, but the slow build-up to the ending can still be noticed and appreciated, speaking for myself.A lot of the reviews I've read are over-the-top with praise and how exceptional the movie was, when to me, it was simply a decent movie, good but not too good, but not bad, hence my rating of 7.0. However, like a few other names in the film business, I'll throw out Jim Jarmusch and Richard Linklater to join with the Coen Brothers, there's an absurd amount of folks who seem to feel that whatever movie these guys create is perfection, whether it's true or not, like they can't admit that a producer/director they're a fan of can possibly produce anything but the best films in history, but that's simply not true. I wish more people would base their judgments of films on the films themselves, regardless of who the producer or director is, than automatically giving perfect ratings because of their hero worship. Like I said, this was a good enough movie in my opinion, but it wasn't close to being as good as 'Fargo'. 'The Big Lebowski', or even 'Raising Arizona' or 'O Brother, Where Art Thou', but lower down in quality, definitely above 'A Serious Man', but nowhere close to the films I just mentioned. I was going to give this a 6.0 rating, but considering the time period in which this was made, and the fact that it was the Coen Brothers debut, I gave it an extra point, which I think, in the long run it deserved.",Blood Simple
228,floydreese,Great Coen debut,7,23 June 2018,This was where the illustrious career of the Coen Brothers began. Blood Simple has all the ingredients of the brother's style right from the small town setting to strange offbeat characters and a plot that cannot be predicted until the end credits start to roll.

I knew it was the Coen's early work and I was afraid that it might let me down. I was so wrong. Even for being made in 1984, this movie would be a smash hit to this day. I'm actually ashamed that I hadn't seen it earlier. I just watched the Director's Cut, which I imagine is quite a bit better than the regular version, so if I had to make a suggestion, it's that you try and see this movie with the Directors Cut. This movie has some great intense moments, it keeps you guessing just what is going to happen next, and it also makes you want to scream at the characters as if they could hear you. Simply put, you should definitely see this film.",Blood Simple
231,toni_41,Blood Simple? It's anything but simple,1,6 February 2007,"A turd walks into a bar and takes a dump. This is pretty much what this film is, a big smelly stinky pile of dog poop. The title here is deceptive, its not simple at all. Its a complex twisted movie. The Coens' try awfully hard to make ""weird"" movies, all the while thumbing their noses at Hollywood. Their target audience are most likely the pseudo intellectual/pseudo artsy types who would not know a GOOD movie if slapped them in face. There is a lot of blood spilled in this movie. Stage blood was probably their biggest expense next to coffee and donuts for the crew. SPOILER-Look away now! It's so predictable, a wife is cheating and the husband wants to get revenge so he hires a hit-man. There are two definite halves to this movie and they are in total disagreement. The first half drags on and on, the dialog drones on, the second half run a horror marathon to the end. The only thing I will give them credit for is the attention to detail-note the rotting fish on the desk!",Blood Simple
232,coenbmw,Masterpiece,10,29 April 2020,"I love Blood Simple. For some, it's maybe only a cleverly crafted low budget neo-noir movie based on the classical husband-wife-wife's lover triangle. For me, it's more than that.
Something about the mood and the aesthetics of the film always fascinated me. The calm, the silence, the flat Texas landscapes, the men taking their time... The camera targets details in meaningful close shots. The sound design is very precise.
Maybe the secret lies in the conversations. Conversations between Ray and Abby, between Ray and Marty, between Marty and the detective... Slightly odd and very funny conversations, wonderfully played by John Getz (fantastic performance), Dan Hedaya, M. Emmet Walsh, Frances McDormand. Connections and premonitions link these conversations between them and announce secretly the fate of the characters.
At the heart of the film there is this scene that I find fantastic where Ray meets Abby in the early morning and they don't, they can't understand what the other is talking about. A masterpiece in incommunicability.",Blood Simple

Cheating spouses, feckless private dicks, mistaken identities, a bundle of dirty cash are rendered to their bare essence in the mess of rotting fish sitting on Marty's desk.  The film is notable as much for the audacity of the Coen brothers in getting it made as it is for its success in turning the broad, open expanses of west texas into a claustrophobia unknown even to Saddam in his spider hole.  It appears the Coens made five minutes of the film to show to investors, though they had absolutely no idea what the rest of the film would look like.  They basically sold the mood of the film, and their efforts bore fruit.  The film established the Coen brothers as a creative force and Frances McDormand as a rising art house star whose journey would eventually garner Oscar for the Coens' ""Fargo.""

The editing for one: how a finger pressing a button at the end of one scene becomes a finger inspecting a blood-stained seat at the start of the next.

While it is watchable, and some parts do becoming gripping, this ultimately is a film i have no desire to re-watch.The script is decent for the most part, but there are some of the cheesiest scenes that I've seen in a long time sprinkled in the movie. The themes of what is good, and what is right, money is the root of evil, and people in positions they are woefully unfit for are prevalent throughout this film. The characters are well written, and you understand all their motivations, however I find pretty much everyone in this movie to be quite bland, but that's probably because the acting is atrocious. The best actor in the movie bar none is M. Emmet Walsh. He is the only person in the movie that actually has fun with the role. Everyone else sounds like they are just reading off of a script from start to finish, and in a contest to see how serious they can sound. There are two stand out moments when Walsh has a scene with Dan Hedaya, and later Frances Mcdormand that features really good acting for the most part, and a sense of atmosphere, but that's really it.I was shocked when i saw that Barry Sonnenfeld was the director for cinematography because it's all over the place, it really feels like a mixed bag of sorts. There are a couple of good shots, some decent shots, and then some really bad shots. Like i said, it just jumps around all over the movie. You go from long continuous shots with an almost speed up pace, to drawn out scenes with jump cuts galore. The editing is pretty bad in my opinion.Like wise, i was equally shocked when i saw Carter Burwell made the music. I don't know what exactly he was thinking, but this soundtrack is laughable. It sounds like the music you would hear when you walk through the living room and your mom is watching one of those Saturday night LMN movies. It just does not work here at all to me.I do like the special effects they use. It looks very nice, and apart from one scene where it's very obvious that it's not blood, it works throughout the movie.This is something that i would expect to see as a made for TV movie from 1998, however as it was the Coen's first movie i wasn't expecting a masterpiece to begin with. I'm glad i can add this to my Watchlist, and i encourage anyone would loves the Coen's to see it, but i'll stick to their later, more refined works.",Blood Simple
239,sean-107,lesser coen brothers effort,5,12 February 2000,I don't think this film holds a candle to the other Coen brothers films and should only be looked at as a kinda student film. a freshman effort and that is that. The film is certainly dated and doesn't give much a payoff. There are a few excellent scenes overall and it is very well written. Only hardcore coen brothers fans should apply. Do check out some of the scene transitions Joel uses. An early example of the greatness to come. 5/10,Blood Simple

Probably nothing, but that won't stop me.It's the best rip off of The Postman Always Rings Twice that I've ever seen, even better than Body Heat.Who would have thought that Frances McDormand used to be this cute?  And I saw this movie when it was new!  No wonder Joel Coen married her.  I would have too.The scene in the cornfield is an all-time classic.  So is the final shootout.M. Emmett Walsh, who is probably better known now for playing Jill's father on Home Improvement, may have been the best character actor of the late twentieth century.  At least, the best _American_ character actor.The commentary track on the DVD is an absolute scream.  The joke goes on too long -- I've only made it through the first 25 minutes so far -- but it has to go on as long as the movie.  Who but the Coens would have gone so completely off the wall?It's better than Fargo.  Fargo was nice for its deep humanity, but lots of movies deliver deep humanity.  The Coens can also deliver total depravity, with no redeeming social value except brilliance.It has the best punchline since the one delivered by Joe E. Walsh in Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot.  Simultaneously hilarious and stunning.The Coens should be named national treasures.Summation:  It's superb.  Made on a shoestring but doesn't look like it. Just when you think you've lost track of the plot, you get it again.  The Coens, like Hitchcock, are master manipulators.  I like that in a pair of filmmakers!",Blood Simple

After seeing Blood Simple, I now have that feeling. This, the feature film debut from the incredible Joel and Ethan Coen, is an out and out masterpiece. Some of the scenes in this film, I'll never forget. They're just so good! It oozed as much suspense as it did blood, and yet, like many other Coen classics, it contained the perfect amount of jet black humor. This is by no means an inspirational movie, but it left me with a massive smile on my face. The finale itself was one of the greatest thriller scenes I can remember, and nothing about it was a happy sight, but damn, did that movie just give me a great feeling. This is a great movie. With such a (excuse the pun) simple plot, the coens have weaved this masterclass in heart-pounding, nail-biting suspense. The entire film was amazingly directed as well. Really, really creative stuff. All the elements were in place. Leaving us with a few great shots and some upbeat Motown music, you'll know that you've seen something special.

The Coen Brothers came out with full force and spun a nice tale about a cheating wife and her lover. There are some great moments of dark comedy (the live burial,) and some trademark excellent Coen brothers scene transitions. This movie takes a few risks and doesn't lay all it's cards face up and leaves you to a draw a few conclusions.

This film captivated me from its quiet beginning to its nerve racking end.  It made me want to see if they could do even better films, and indeed they did with their next try, Raising Arizona.There are scenes in this movie that are haunting -- scenes that pop up in your night mares from time to time.  If you've seen the movie you know the scenes I'm talking about.  However, the characters make this movie.  M. Emmet Walsh was perfectly cast as the seediest of seedy private eyes. Frances McDormat was wonderful as the nervous cheating wife.  That final confusing scene between the two of them is classic.Don't miss this film if you like film noir, eye popping cinematography, or just a well conceived plot.

249,wargo802,Very stylish film,6,6 January 2005,"Blood Simple moves along quite slowly and the dialog is a little clunky (it feels like a Lifetime movie in places), in the end it is a good watch because of its stylish direction. Just as Fargo captured the bluntness of Minnesota and The Big Lebowski displays the zaniness of LaLa land, I don't think Texas has ever been as creepy as in Blood Simple. The film's slow pace creates a creepier setting than the frantic pace of a horror film (such as the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre). While this isn't one of the Coens' best films it is a good thriller that few others could make. The only disappointment is that the characters are much blander than many of their later films and that is what really prevents Blood Simple from becoming a Coens classic.",Blood Simple

Frances McDormand is perfect as Abby, the wife of a club owner intent on leaving her husband, as is John Getz as Ray, her newly found lover, and Samm-Art Williams as Meurice, the slightly off balance husband.

So the other reason to watch Blood Simple lies here. Had I seen Blood Simple in 1984 I wouldn't have predicted that these guys will create such marvelous films - some of which are modern classics - as they've done. Simply, I would have suggested them to stay away from cinema and find another direction for their lives. Thank God someone was wiser than I'd have been.Three stars is a fair deal.

253,achyut-mohali,Brutal to the core,10,20 March 2014,The film is a revelation. It terrifies you to the core. It depicts how people around you can go to great lengths to cause you hurt and even death. They commit these acts not in the 'heat of the moment' but these acts can be pretty elaborate. Even constant pleading of someone you know isn't enough to stop you. Mind you this is not a story of some hardened criminals but normal folks who are capable of extreme cruelty when just pushed enough.This by no means appears to be a work of a debutant director. This movie marks the arrival of greatest contemporary directors. Among other noteworthy features of the movie is the use of car radio. Sometimes just random sounds are enough to fill you with horror,Blood Simple
254,cmm0855-723-261226,Four Dead Fish,8,11 August 2013,"A methodical, taut neo-noir that does justice to the best of the genre, while introducing us to the unique sensibilities of the Coen Bros. The camera moves confidently, purposefully matching shot composition, lighting, and editing rhythms with the content of the drama unfolding. The movie's leitmotif of moral ambiguity and of distrust in a fallen from grace, corrupted world oozes in a highly-controlled, spellbinding way from nearly every scene in the film. The bleaker than bleak atmosphere is occasionally interwoven with perverse bits of hilarity bearing the Coen Bros. signature. The employees must wash hands bit and the engraved man of the year on Walsh's lighter had me literally laughing out loud in a film otherwise weighted with dead-seriousness. The finale with Walsh and the pipes is self- evidently great and the scene of him trying to get through the wall compares favorably with the moments leading up to the ""Here's Johnny"" line in Kubrick's the Shining. Some quibbles: the film feels very slow and the repeated symbol of the four dead fish lacks subtlety. It also doesn't seem plausible that Hedaya would have gone fishing in Corpus. Also, the Meurice character doesn't add much to the film and feels like an unnecessary, fifth wheel. The casting is superb with the exception of McDormand, who just doesn't work in the ingenue, possible femme-fatale mold. All in all, bravo Coen Bros.",Blood Simple
255,crocsn,Strongest Debut Ever?,10,24 June 2018,"I was already a big fan of the Coen Brothers before I saw Blood Simple, I loved Fargo and thought No Country for Old Men was also great. But Blood Simple has this feeling of unease that I don't think the Coen's have captured since. The cinematography in this film is one of it's defining aspects, the slow, lingering shots and great use of colour give the film a grungy and ominous feel, yet still showing its 80's feel. The acting in this film is also phenomenal, Frances McDormand does a great debut performance giving her character a great sense of worriedness, Dan Hedaya pulls off an agitated performance with a visible radiance of anger. John Getz's performance is often overlooked, yet I feel that it is a great depiction of someone under extreme stress, and of course M. Emmet Walsh does possibly the best perfomance of his career playing a menacing and disturbing private detective. The way Walsh can go from being calm and jokey to serious and dark in a matter of seconds brings a strong sense of anxiety to viewers of the film. The soundtrack is also great, a debut by legendary composer Carter Burwell possesses a dark yet simplistic tone that makes it one of my favourite soundtracks in all of film. Overall this is an amazing neo-noir, one of the best of it's kind, I would highly reccommend that you buy the Criterion Collection Blu-Ray which contains a beautiful looking restoration of the film and lots of behind the scenes content. This film proves itself to be among the great directorial debuts like Reservoir Dogs, Citizen Kane and This is Spinal Tap.",Blood Simple

It's one of those movies where you find yourself wanting to constantly yell at the characters. This is probably because only 5 characters have more then one line in this film, which creates an intimate relationship between the viewer and main characters. It's not common for a movie that revolves around a murder to never have police involved, (or a single cop even seen for that matter) but the Coen brothers create a small town atmosphere where it seems only natural for gunshots to ring out in the night with no response, a place where people reach for their revolver rather than calling for help. To me the role of the sleazy gun for hire is the best part of the movie. He is transformed from a bumbling, unthreatening man who hangs out by the smoking teenagers, into a believable menace whom you could picture toting a sniper rifle opposite your apartment building.",Blood Simple

Take a misdeed, a sin if you will, and let it set off a chain of events that eventually leads to an ultimate redemption and a righting of the wrong.

In 20 minutes I already was so bored. I understand that in the 80's no one locks their door, but if you're having sex the wife of a man who just threatened you, you lock it! Then, with all that blood he lost, how he could still be alive? Also Ray has a nice car, a good house, he dresses well and he works as a bartender, why he has a shovel on his car? Then it just get worse and worse, if an almost dead man is pointing a gun on you, you watch him and let him shoot you twice? After that scene Ray says to Abby ""if you shoot someone, you have to make sure he is dead""... but he buried a man alive!! The directors try to give the impression that ""no one knows whats going on"" and that's because they don't talk! At least Abby with Ray, come on! A disappointing movie, with awful characters and poor techniques to try to make you feel the suspense. My advice? Don't loose your time.",Blood Simple
260,jerryscoldwell,Movie lovers will love this film.,10,8 April 2020,"Movies seem to be very predictable these days, of course there are exceptions, but a lot of films you know where they are going and how it's going to end. In Blood Simple it is far from predictable. Each scene is wonderfully shot and many are quite frightening as well. Although this is not a horror movie of course, I found myself jumping at scenes because they were so damn intense and unexpected. A hell of a movie. Bravo, Bravo, Bravo.",Blood Simple
261,doc holi,"An intelligently written story of a ""failure to communicate.""",10,15 September 1999,"A complex story, written tightly and intelligently.  the story is honest and hangs together; if you are paying *close* attention there are no surprises. the subtitle should be ""a failure to communicate.""  this is pure coen brothers:  their first and perhaps their best.",Blood Simple
262,gyoung-2,Better than Fargo!,10,16 August 2000,"The best of all the Coen's films, though they're all great. I didn't notice any difference between the original and the director's cut, but it was nice seeing it on a big screen for the first time. There is so much you could say about this film. It was a nice touch to give the gun such a prominent role. In a sense, you could view the movie as basically a story about a gun. It's mentioned in the very first line of dialogue when Abby tells Ray about the gun she got her husband for their anniversary. You might notice it's also the central image in the movie poster. This is the film where the Coen's really pulled out all the stops. You get the impression maybe they thought this would be their only shot at ever making a movie, so they did everything they ever dreamed of doing with a movie. Every few minutes there's another clever idea. You really sense the fun they had making it. Delightful to watch. By the way, I think Miller's Crossing was also better than Fargo.",Blood Simple
263,opusbum,beautiful for a first film.,8,22 August 2000,"I just saw the 2000 re-release.  having missed my film time for another picture i decided to see this instead, because, hey - it's the coen brother's, it can't be bad...  the ""new"" introduction to the film is hilarious - a man, reading a book with a pipe and saying how the film went on to critical success and record breaking attendance...  but the film itself, from what i understand has actually been cut down a bit.  takes a bit for it to really take off, but the cresendo is well worth the wait.  as always, some beautiful writing, some beautiful cinema.  it shows how the coen bros, even early, while having some very interesting plot turns, twists, and strange dream-subconscious images were more interested in showing us the emotions of their characters inside of these convoluted plots, not just trying to exploit the plots themselves.",Blood Simple
264,kakgirl,Hitchcockian Paradise,8,9 May 2001,"Blood Simple is a bizarre crime story that gets under way rather casually, when the young wife of a greasy Texas saloon owner starts an affair with one of her husband's bartenders. The suspicious husband hires a detective to murder the couple, but things do not turn out quite as planned. The Coen brothers are obviously fans of Hitchcock.  Blood Simple is filled with homages to more than one of Hitchcock's classics.  I highly recommend this unique indie film by the brothers of bizarre!",Blood Simple
265,Bishop1342,The Coen Brothers first film,10,21 May 2003,"When thinking of smart dark comedies, well thought out suspense scenes full of great anticipation and realistic violence, you think of the Coen Brothers. In this their first feature film we find that every element that would later go on to define them in such films as Fargo and Barton Fink are already here. Blood Simple is a text book on how to make a good dark comedy/suspense film. The characters are all delightfully brutal and stupid, you could almost imagine real criminals doing the exact same things. Beautiful Suspense tools would be employed for the first time: a gun with 3 bullets that keeps on changing hands and keeps on landing on empty chambers at just the wrong time, and bullet holes in the wall that make streaks of light showing us just how close each bullet came. This Film introduced the Coen Brothers to Frances McDormand and would introduce the Coen Brothers to the world. A truly first rate thriller.",Blood Simple
266,crobarus,Slow moving but great,9,5 November 2007,"None of the characters know what's going on in this film. Except the dead guy. Really tricky plot. The things you do for love. Great performances, great writing , great film. Check it out if you don't have a short attention span. 10 lines? My comment needs tp contain 10 lines. According to Yahoo. What's that all about. Do they want me to write a book? Or what? I liked the movie. Isn't that enough? I'm still trying to fill the 10 line thing. I guess I got like three more lines to go. I thought I would give a simple review. Do I have to be a professional writer to comment on a Movie. Give me a break here. Is it ten lines yet? Can I post my stupid comment yet ? Or should I type until my fingers fall off?",Blood Simple
267,sina-rbehzad,Elementary,5,9 November 2012,"The story is splendid but there are two major things that I didn't like, first, when the private detective decided to kill Marty he was very nervous and staring at the safe, well, what did I get from that scene? I guessed that he will kill Marty while opening the safe and steal something more than $10,000 but he didn't. Second, He was a smoker and If you ask me as a smoker I would light a cigarette immediately after escaping I mean just when I left there but I think It was a day after when he recognized he has forgotten his Zippo. I love Coen brothers and I think as their first film as an elementary It's not bad.",Blood Simple
268,acidsores,I guess everybody's gotta start somewhere,1,17 August 2004,"This was one of the worst movies in recent memory. For a movie that David Ansen of Newsweek calls ""The most inventive and original thriller in many a moon."" it was awfully bland and lackluster. Not a very good or original plot or script and the poor acting and editing was unfortunate. There were a few attempts at ""artsy"" and ""original"" camera work, but they were obvious and too deliberate. It is a run of the mill B-murder-mystery without any mystery. It ends with such a mildly ironic twist that i was left wondering if it was really any twist at all. Now I love the Cohen Bros films because of the fun quirks, strong and interesting characters, strange and thoughtful stories, plot twists, and the often masterful nature of the totality of the final product, But you will find none of that here. It was the Cohen Bros first movie, so perhaps the criticism is a little harsh, but i'm not so much concerned with the Cohen bro's feelings as I am with preventing anyone reading this from wasting three of their hard earned dollars.",Blood Simple
269,xenchu,My First Coen Bros. Movie,9,7 January 2006,"I was impressed by a certain grittiness that ran through this movie as it does through other Coen movies such as Miller's Crossing and Fargo. Characters do things that are not logical but still seem inevitable. Not every question is answered to the viewers' satisfaction. The Coen Brothers seem able to get uniformly good performances out of all the actors in each film. The bar owner is sleazy, the detective is mysterious, the lovers seem to be lost pawns. Motives for actions are sometimes unexplained.Certainly not everyone will like the ending, but it makes any other possible ending seem contrived. If you love movies then this is one to see.",Blood Simple
