0,Leofwine_draca,A waste of two good actors,2,22 January 2018,"Despite a number of positive reviews for this film collected here, I'm afraid I have to be the dissenting voice. I found I ORIGINS a very difficult film to watch, purely because it's boring in scope and tone. The story explores some sci-fi concepts regarding the human eye and reincarnation, but they're dealt with in the dreariest way imaginable, with endless soul-searching and lame romantic sub-plots that drag out an already slow pacing. What's particularly disappointing is the waste of two fine TV actors, Michael Pitt (of BOARDWALK EMPIRE) and Steven Yeun (of THE WALKING DEAD). I feel like the ideas might have worked better as a term paper instead of a pretend film.",I Origins
1,SnoopyStyle,intriguing premise but second half stumbles,6,6 February 2017,"Ian Gray (Michael Pitt) is a PHD student in New York. At a Halloween party, he meets a mysterious girl. He takes a picture of her eye as he often does. She leaves before getting her name. With only a picture of her eye, he finds her from a billboard leading him to spiritual model Sofi (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey). He's researching a way to make color-blind mice see color. Karen (Brit Marling) is his new first-year student assistant. They start a project to create eyes on an animal without eyes showing the evolution of the eye and to debunk Intelligent Design.The premise is intriguing. The story starts well. It is ambitious in its subject matter. The film is solid up to the end of Sofi. Then it tries to do too much. Writer/director Mike Cahill is unable to corral the various ideas into a compelling story. It's obvious what it's trying to do but it struggles to make it interesting. I still give it full marks for its ambitions despite its failure to achieve its full intention.",I Origins
2,Prismark10,I Spy,3,7 January 2016,"Mike Cahill's I Origins has some beautiful pictures of eyes but it is a dull film, Cahill as director cannot do justice to his ideas and his leading man is not a strong enough actor.Michael Pitt plays Ian, a talented bio-chemist researching the evolution of human eyes. As a rationalist who makes his decisions based on scientific data, he wants to challenge the creationist beliefs of Intelligent Design.Ian meets the spiritual, beautiful and mysterious Sofi, who begin a love affair after a convoluted set of circumstances including photographing her eyes. Her bizarre death in an elevator accident (badly filmed) will ultimately lead him to question his views on rationality.Some time later Ian marries his Lab Assistant Karen and they have a baby who is tested by a doctor for supposed autism but they later discover that an iris scan taken of their child when he was a baby matched a person who died around the time the baby was conceived. The film takes a spiritual side shift with the possibility of reincarnation raised.As they examine the iris database it reveals that there maybe a child in India with Sofi's eyes. The last act takes place in India as Ian tries to track down an orphan girl which also includes a creepy scene of a western white male taking a little girl on her own to his hotel room on the premise of giving her food.At the hotel he tests the girl but the results may not be conclusive, you might jolt though as they later wait for the lift to arrive.The film wants to have an existential discussion however the film and the lead actor is not equipped to deal with it as the narrative becomes increasingly outlandish.",I Origins
3,nogodnomasters,IT IS DANGEROUS TO PLAY GOD,8,8 May 2019,"Ian Gray (Michael Pitt) is an atheist fascinated with the human eye. He takes pictures of them all the time. One of his pet projects is to come up with a complete evolution of the human, as a way to foil creationists. His girlfriend however, believes in the transmigration of the soul. Circumstances become odd as Ian is faced with the possibility of using his iris scans to prove it.I liked the film. Acting was decent. It was good science fiction in the fact that it didn't going into areas of gross impossibility. The ending of the film, right before the climax, you know it is coming. as you feel the anticipation. Great scene.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey)",I Origins
4,kosmasp,I believe,8,4 February 2015,"Or something like that. It's science and logic versus the inexplainable. The I of the beholder might see things differently of course. But apart of the obvious yet somehow subtle title wink (no pun intended), this movie does deliver (and yes, has more to offer than meets the eye, to get that one out of the way too).The acting is really good and while you might be able to see where this is going (sorry for the puns), the movie is still able to hold up the tension. It sounds scientific at times, but never goes over your head, if you stay with it. It might be a bit too long, but it never gets boring overall. Whether you agree or get on with the ride, might change your view and your experience with the movie. But it's a ""risk"" well worth taking and watching",I Origins
5,rmax304823,Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.,5,9 June 2015,"I missed the first several minutes of this, so some of these comments may be misleading.Michael Pitt is a doctor doing research on developing ""eyes"" on worms that are blind and insensitive to light. He and his lab mate, Brit Marling, are industrious, earnest almost to the point of obsession. That doesn't prevent Pitt from falling in love with a spiritual French girl, Astrid Bergès-Frisbey. When he and Marling experience a breakthrough in their research, Pitt drags his spiritual girl friend to the laboratory and they have a neat little argument.Pitt believes in science, not transmigration of souls. Not that it stops him from describing the love of HIS atoms for HER atoms at the time of the Big Bang. That's a mind full right there. That there were no atoms at the Big Band -- just quarks and stuff -- is irrelevant. His and her quarks would probably have loved each other anyway.Astrid Bergès-Frisbey's position is that there is more to the world that just what we can prove scientifically. Take those worms. They were sensitive only to touch and one other primitive sense, right? They were unaware of light. Yet the light existed and was all around them. Isn't it possible that there is something going on that we are ignorant of, just as the worms were ignorant of light? Pitt doesn't have a good answer, but a scientists would. The answer is: ""Yes."" Alas -- in a tense and surprisingly shocking scene -- Pitt loses his forever and ever love in a death by elevator. He descends into a funk until Marling snaps him out of it, and marries him and bears him a child in the bargain.So far, so good, then I got lost. The configuration of spots and streaks on the iris of the eye are supposed to be unique to each person, like snowflakes and fingerprints. And you can capture the exact pattern with what appears to be a cell cam. Snap -- and you've got it. Millions of eyes are in the data base and Pitt and his team find a precise duplicate of Bergès-Frisbey's irises, registered to a young girl somewhere in India. And, by the way, I don't believe Astrid Bergès-Frisbey's last name is real at all. Nobody is named Bergès-Frisbey. That's ridiculous. Not her, just her name.The narrative takes Pitt to India where, after an exhaustive search, a little girl shows up with his first love's irises. He doesn't find her, actually. She just stands and stares at him in a public square and he knows at once that this is the spirit reborn of Astrid with that phony last name. He gives the child some tests. The results are inconclusive, but in the last scene he finds that she is absolutely terrified by elevators. Q.E.D.To put it in a nutshell, the film is a loosely limbed argument in favor of reincarnation. I don't know exactly who the intended audience is. Christian mythology may sell, but Hindu mythology? The film itself is well acted. Brit Marling is always good, and she's attractive in a way that doesn't quite achieve Hollywood's standards of beauty. She does much more than act, in real life. Pitt is hard to pin down. The poor guy is saddled with these big lips. He seems to be always pouting and it's so distracting that it's hard to judge his performance. I give him bonus points for being from West Orange, New Jersey. The direction is competent enough but from what I gleaned from the narrative, it's really screwy. The thought, however, of being reborn is comforting, as long as you come back as some kind of Bill Gates and not a sewer rat -- or a blind worm.The movie is likable for its earnestness and for the writer and director to do something a little challenging. I'm sure with a little effort they could have worked in some Oedipus Rex somewhere. And I appreciate the titular pun. ""I"" = ""Eye"". And the idea can't be THAT alien to Homo sapiens. After all, lots of religions have afterlives, only the same spirits don't always return to earth as ""old loves but in shapes that renew and renew forever"", as the poet put it.",I Origins
6,ComedyFan2010,A clever sci fi movie that is pretty calm and yet keeps one's attention,9,22 August 2017,"I loved this movie. I see many people complaining about it being a movie where religion defeats science, but I didn't see it this way. It is a sci fi movie. Fi stands for fiction as we know it. It is not supposed to be a documentary on evolution and biology but include a story about something that is now what we can see being proved by science.Second, the ending is open for interpretation. And I liked it. The test fails. The girl is afraid of the elevator, but so what? Kids are afraid of many things that can be a coincidence. I actually loved the scene of the test being done. I am an atheist. And when the movie started and I got the main theme I thought that hopefully it is not about religion defeating science. Yet there I was watching the girl after several correct answers giving incorrect ones and feeling a weird disappointment. At the end when Karen asks Ian how he felt he says ""kind of foolish"", this is basically what I did too. And then there was still a part of me hoping that the girl will say something that will see us a Sofi being part of her. And she did it with the elevator. And I think it Sofi, yet as I said keeps our interpretation open. For all we know she is just claustrophobic.Another thing is that I think it is supposed to simply say that there is so much more out there that we can't explain yet. That can be scientific and proved by data but that we don't even imagine. And I am not talking about God. Science just keeps developing and one day people may be studying things that we can't imagine now. And it will be a scientist like Ian, who is willing to go and test something to make sure that what he doesn't believes in is incorrect instead of dismissing it.To me the movie wasn't predictable. I didn't see the trailer before watching it and just read a one sentence description. So luckily for me the main idea and what will happen weren't open from the start which made the movie more enjoyable. The acting was perfect. I liked how incredibly natural these people felt to me. The main character also being so complex. He isn't dull as people referred to him. He is normal. But being normal includes so many parts. He is the guy who believes in data but just for the hell of it follows the number 11. His attitude towards the female characters of the movie and changing of it. We can see him starting to respect Karen after dismissing her as a first year student he needs to get rid of. Somehow one feels the two are right for each other yet he ends up with Sofi at first, who is so different. Yet we get the passion that can make us miss the huge differences between us and the person we are with which gets to his mind in that fatal night in the elevator, as he then describes it to Karen. His character is important to the drama romance part of the movie and represent the humanity so well.The little girl Kashish playing Salomina was also good and it is her first part! I love how vivid her face was when she was answering the questions in the hotel room.Well, the movie was sure impressive. I just don't get why Ian didn't contact Dr. Simmons to talk about what she is researching. But this could be because he wanted to try first his own thing. And this way also getting a closure that he said he was missing after Sofi's death. I will look out for more work of the director and the actors as I was impressed.",I Origins
7,LeonLouisRicci,Awful Suck-Face First-HalfSecond-Half Tries Awful Hard and Succeeds,7,30 May 2015,"Sophomore Director Mike Cahill Makes Another Thought Provoking but Inconsistent Film with an Eye on the Big Picture Concerning the Science vs Spirituality Debate. The Two Paths Towards Truth and Understanding Frequently and Uncomfortably Interconnect and it Usually isn't a Pretty Picture, Because Both Sides Frustratingly Refuse to Give an Inch.But This Movie is Full of Pretty Pictures as the Director has a Flair for Artistry and a Curiosity to Explore Different and Existential Subject Matters. In This One, the First Half Almost Destroys any Interest in Any Subject Other than Romantic Relationships and it has a Pensity to Suck-Face Until it Becomes Almost a Bail-Out for Anyone Wanting to Experience Something Beyond a Chick-Flick.Thankfully a Surprise Scene Sets Things on a Different Course and While it Does Not Completely Abandon Loving Relationships, it is a Welcome Turn of Events and Tone and the Film Gets Most of its Charm from the Story of a Scientist that is Forced to Evaluate Previous Dogma, Has His Eyes Opened to Other Possibilities and Ends with an Opening Where it is Left for the Viewer to Contemplate.Overall, After the First Almost Deadly First Act, it Settles Into a World of Undergraduate Science and Philosophy Set in a World of Phd's. Worth a Watch for the Unique Subject Matter and its Artistic Display. Note...The title is a clunky attempt at cleverness. Not nearly as clever as the Thesis.",I Origins
8,ferguson-6,Eye Thoughtful,7,19 July 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. The evening I saw this one, I tweeted ""Mike Cahill is one of today's most intriguing filmmakers"". After a few days to think about it, that belief remains so. A double feature of this and his previous film ""Another Earth"" could keep the conversation flowing for days and weeks.Evolution vs Spirituality is the main theme here. Miohael Pitt plays molecular biologist Ian Gray, who is working diligently to prove that the evolution of the eye is the scientific proof debunking creationism and spirituality. Ian's petri dish view of life is challenged when he meets free-spirited Sofi (Astrid Berges-Frisbey). This takes opposites attract to a whole new level ... in fact, opposites actually detract ... from the story and tone. While Sofi causes cracks in Ian's convictions, their ultimate split is actually a turning point for the film. The second half is extremely entertaining and thought-provoking.Leaping ahead a few years, we find Ian married to his previous lab assistant Karen (Brit Marling). These two have an intriguing bond, and the birth of their first child sends the two scientists back into research mode ... including some globe trotting. Retina scanning technology plays a huge role here, and leads Ian to India where he searches for proof of this new theory.This existential trip has an inordinate number of coincidences, lucky breaks, and philosophical discussions ... not to mention a rainbow range of eye glass styles. If you enjoy films that generate post-viewing discussions, Mr. Cahil is proving himself as the go-to filmmaker. Whether you fall on the side of science or spirituality, or somewhere in-between, this film seeks to prove the eyes have it.",I Origins
9,siderite,Another Another Earth,9,24 December 2014,"Mike Cahill creates another low budget low key fantasy film, using some of the same actors as in Another Earth, and again he succeeds in producing something intriguing. I watched Another Earth and I really liked it, because it didn't just publish an idea, but it built and grew its characters, reaching the underwhelming, but thought provoking ending. I liked I Origins for the same reasons, but truth be said, it's just not as good. If you watched this film and liked it, you will love Another Earth.The story is difficult to explain without spoiling the basic plot. Let's just say it is a journey of discovery for the main character. The film starts with a really slow pace and much of what happens in the first half is just character exposition, rather than development. That may put some people off. However it is important to understand all characters to get the film, and they are all rather interesting and original, not tired clichés. I liked that.So basically you get a well done, well acted movie, involving interesting characters in an intriguing story. What else do you need? With a cast like Michael Pitt and Brit Marling, it feels like the indie film that it is, but I thought it was clearly worth watching. Some scenes could have been removed to make the movie last less than the full two hours, but they do develop the characters and pull the viewer into their story a little.",I Origins
10,A_Different_Drummer,"Bloody Brilliant - with an ""unforgettable"" elevator scene",10,5 December 2014,"You know those black vans you see in the spy movies? Well -- and I have never said this before in any of my 900+ reviews for IMDb -- one of those vans should swoop in and ""borrow"" director Mike Cahill and, before he knows what is happening, spirit him away to Hollywood.Where (and this next comment is ironic given the theme of I ORIGINS) he could spend the rest of his days improving the ""gene pool"" of the endlessly recycled flotsam and jetsam that passes for ""original"" content from Tinseltown these days (yet another riff off the title of the current film, if you are keeping track).This movie is not only technically perfect but the director/writer (Cahill) is so good one expects that he could coax a competent performance from a piece of lawn furniture if he had to.He reminds me of early ""Darren Aronofsky"" - so competent that his career has no limits or boundaries anyone can see.Many (too many) film makers have attempted to combine a love story with a sci-fi theme, but Cahill nails it here.Brilliant film, grows on the viewer like a comfortable shirt, keeps you glued.And oh by the way, there is a scene at the 47:00 mark which is as stunning, jarring, visceral and unforgettable as any you have ever seen in any film ever done, even horror films.Cahill is that good.",I Origins
11,851222,Great movie,10,25 December 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""I Origins"" (2014) is a superb drama with sci-fi elements, that looks closer to reality then fiction from recent sci-fi movies. Acting was very solid, direction, script were superb as well as the music - great stuff. This picture grabbed me from first moments till the very last end - i couldn't take my eyes from screen and was captivated in the story. At running time 1 h 48 min it never drags and is superbly paced. Overall, ""I Origins"" touches great themes, approaches them with more sciences rather then fiction and does a great job of keeping you glued to the screen during the process - what else can you ask from a motion picture. Great movie.",I Origins
12,Bored_Dragon,Not for everyone,8,19 April 2017,"IMDb rating is 7, on web people mostly bash it, but it moved me totally. This drama, with elements of romance, adventure, SF, and even horror, is easy to follow, but heavy if it hits you right. I understand why most people hate it. The movie is good, but it definitely isn't for everyone.8/10",I Origins
13,Floated2,Thought Provoking and Unique,7,28 November 2015,"I Origins (bizare title- I'm sure they could have thought of something more thoughtful) is a rather intelligent and ambitious sci-fi drama. The film really aspires for something grand, universal and deep, and it often achieves its goal. One could argue the entire picture is an exploration of the disconcerting sensation of déjà vu, and what it all means behind the curtain of the subliminal. Considering ideas of reincarnation, the afterlife and more, I Origins is a fascinating examination of belief, spirituality and through the skeptical lens of science. Some of the faith vs. science themes are a little too on the nose, the transition in relationship isn't as elegant as it could be and some of the plot conceits—a temporary blindness, a tragedy—are a little contrived and strain suspension of disbelief.Although what the audience watches, is more so a film which tales on what it does not know what it wants to be. I Origins feels as if it is two completely different films, divided into two parts, each with a different leading woman. Director Mike Cahill wrote the film's ending which ends up bizarre and not predictable, which is a great and unique talent. I Origins is definitely a unique film, and with so many of these type of films, it is not a film for everyone.",I Origins
14,howard.schumann,"A simple, life-affirming film",9,19 August 2014,"Ian Gray (Michael Pitt) is a PhD student whose research is focused on the evolution of the eye. A confirmed atheist, he hopes his project will prove that the eye has indeed evolved through mutations and disprove once and for all the theory of Intelligent Design. Winner of the Alfred P. Sloan prize at Sundance, Mike Cahill's lovely and touching I Origins is a follow-up to his first feature, the sci-fi'er, Another Earth, which won the same prize at Sundance in 2011. Backed by the songs of Radiohead, I Origins is a thought-provoking look at questions of faith, destiny, and what might lie beyond death.Ian works at the lab with his assistant, Karen (Brit Marling), an intellectual first-year medical student, and with Kenny (Steven Yeun), Ian's roommate and research partner. They are looking for a life form that contains the proper genetic material that will allow them to recreate the series of mutations that have led to the complex organ we are familiar with today. Aware that we all have eye biometrics that are specific to us, part of the research he and Kenny does is the cataloging of the uniqueness of each person's eye pattern. When they find the life form they are looking for – it is a simple worm.The film spends much of the opening minutes in the lab, but we soon find ourselves at a Halloween party where Ian meets Sofi (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey), an exotic Argentinean/French girl whose stunning eyes are all he can see under her party mask. The two make passionate love in the bathroom but she quickly disappears before he can see her face, get her name, or any contact information. Determined to find her, Ian is guided through the strange recurrence of the number eleven to a billboard that he takes as a metaphor for Sofi's eyes searching for him, eventually recognizing her by her green eyes on a New York train. The two have a strong physical connection, though their temperaments and views are poles apart.As a logical scientist, he believes in what can be measured and feels that nothing exists beyond our ordinary sense perception. She is more of a free spirit who thinks that there is a spiritual presence in the world and that the reality we see is but part of a larger one. When Ian discusses his research of the eye and how he wants to discredit the idea of Intelligent Design, Sofi asks, ""Why do you try so hard to disprove God?"" Ian replies, ""Who proved that God is there in the first place."" To that, Sofi tells him, ""You live in a room with books, a bed, your logic, but there is a door and there is something more on the other side."" When their relationship is unexpectedly ended, the film jumps ahead seven years to where Dr. Ian Gray and Karen are now both full professors, married with a newborn son. Ian's reputation has grown and he has written a best-selling book named The Complete Eye. When Tobias, their first child is born, his eyes are scanned as part of a biometric identification system only to discover that his scan matches that of a recently deceased African-American man in his 60s. Trying to make sense of this puzzle, he travels to Idaho and then to the teeming streets of New Delhi, India where he meets Priya (Archie Panjabi), a community service worker who takes him to Salomina (Kashish), an eight-year-old girl whose eyes match the color and shape of Sofi's, a discovery that challenges his belief system.I Origins is not a philosophical treatise, but a film about character growth and how personal relationships can affect how we hold our experience of life. In this summer season where mass-produced entertainments focus on zombies, monsters, dysfunctional families, and comic-book heroes, the film stands out as a welcome exception. It is a simple, life-affirming film that is more about letting go and being open to all possibilities than about promoting a particular position. It asks not only whether faith can co-exist with science but whether, in this age of science, enchantment can be restored to our lives. It answers with a resounding yes.",I Origins
15,paul-allaer,Difficult to categorize movie is a bit all over the place but intrigues at times,7,1 August 2014,"""I Origins"" (2014 release; 117 min.) brings the story of Dr. Ian Gray (played by Michael Pitt). As the movie opens, we are in the present day, as Gray explains what he does (complicated research on the iris patterns of the eyes). We soon thereafter are transported back 7 years and we see Gray meeting a mysterious woman at a Halloween party. (We later learn her name, Sofi, played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey.) Sofi has remarkable iris patterns and Gray asks if he can photograph them, which she lets him. She takes off before Gray gets her name or number, but through a number of circumstances, he is able to track her down, and they really hit it off. In a parallel story line, Karen (played by Brit Marking) is Gray's new lab research assistant. They are conducting all kids of experiments on blind mice and worms, which they hope will lead to a breakthrough. At this point we 're less than 30 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the newest film from writer-director Mike Cahill, who previously brought is that other science-fiction flavored movie a few years back, ""Another Earth"". Second, this movie contains elements of science-fiction, but it is a lot of other things too, and as such this movie is difficult to categorize (and as a result also problematic from a marketing perspective). If by chance you have seen the trailer for this movie (as I had before going in), you know what I mean. As a further aside, the trailer revealed WAY TOO MUCH of the story, so you are better off staying away from seeing it. Third, the movie tries to pit religion against science, and does not succeed well on that level. What at some point is ""why are you working so hard to disprove God"" becomes later on ""What will you do if spirituality disproves your scientific position?"". Fourth, there are some good performances in here. While I'm not a huge fan of actress-model Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, she does quite well in here. On the other hand, I'll go see Brit Marling in just about any movie, and her string of good roles in recent years (Another Earth, Sound of My Voice, Arbitrage, The East, just to name those) is quite impressive. Last but not least, there is a very nice electronica soundtrack, composed by Will Bates and Phil Mossman, and there are also two Radiohead songs in the movie, Life in a Glasshouse, and Motion Picture Soundtrack, the latter playing over the dramatic closing scenes just before the end titles. Speaking of which: DO NOT LEAVE when the end titles start rolling, as there is an intriguing and surprising post-end titles sequence you don't want to miss...The movie opened will little pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati this weekend. I went to see it right away, and the early evening screening I saw this at was not particularly well attended. As I alluded to, this movie is difficult to categorize and is a bit all over the place. I would be surprised if it played more than a week in the theatre here in Cincinnati, but maybe this is one of those movies that finds a wide audience once it's released on DVD/Blu-ray. If you are in the mood for something very different from the mega-summer blockbusters which Hollywood never ceases to throw at us, you might be very well served checking out ""I Origins"", be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",I Origins
16,jimbo-53-186511,"Uses geek talk, baffling exposition and mind-boggling science to carry a weak story (one which is non-existent for the first 60 minutes)",2,27 December 2015,"I'll say something for this film and that is that it certainly grabs you at the start; Pitt's monologue at the start builds the premise up well and even suggests that we'll learn a lot from a set of eyes that we see on screen - again suggesting that we're bearing witness to something profound and clever. I only wish that I got that experience...Despite the bold claims at the start, writer and director Mike Cahill seemed unsure how to actually tell this story and for whatever reason he decided not to bother telling any sort of story for about the first hour. At the start Ian Gray (Michael Pitt) meets Sofi (Astid Berges-Frisbey) and takes a picture of her eyes. This is quite interesting at first as her identity is kept a secret and it does make you want to learn more about her (which is actually disappointing when her identity is revealed and we learn that she isn't all that interesting). All this is then followed by lots of geeky chatter, baffling exposition that is so complex and inaccessible that you'd probably need a PHD in bio-science to understand what the hell the characters are talking about. The film also seems to have a lot of focus on Ian and his lab assistant Karen (Brit Marling) carrying out various tests on animals - I'm unsure why it seemed to be featured so prominently when it had nothing really to do with what little story there was here. You could argue that it's there to make us think about whether man should or should not try to tamper with and/or alter nature, but this is never made clear and to me it just felt like padding to the film. The characters are also rather poorly developed and I found Sofi and Ian's wedding arrangements came out of nowhere (what do we really learn about them)??? Cahill seems to remember in the second half of the film that he has a story to tell and mercifully starts getting to the point (I was losing the will to live by this point btw). It essentially boils down to certain people being born with eyes with identical iris patters to people who have died before they were born - thereby suggesting a reincarnation or afterlife connection. This came as a bit of a disappointment to me as I was expecting something a bit more original (given the way the story is built up to be something fantastic at the start). Essentially it's merely a slight reworking of a film called The Eye and actually offers very little in the way of surprises at the end.The biggest problem with I, Origins is that it just takes far too long telling its story and is relatively uninteresting for much of its running time. It seems to be a film that is crammed full of clever chatter without being a particularly clever film.",I Origins
17,arthur_tafero,I Origins - A Rare Perfect Film,10,22 December 2018,"This is a must-see film. I am not given to 10 rated movies, but this is one of them.
Mike Cahill is brilliant, both as a writer and as a director. His writing skills are off the chart. There is nothing like a great story to make a great movie, and this is why I Origins is a great film. It is a film about discovery, the possibility of alternative philosophies and science. It is a film about human relationships and how we perceive them. Any one great film about any one of these topics would be enough to gain rave reviews, but to have all four elements of these diverse topics in the same film and have the movie flow in a seamless fashion, defies most of the expectations of any moviegoer. Micheal Pitt is perfect (except for smoking lol) as the obsessive eye doctor, Brit Marling is wonderfully understated as his soulmate (be careful here with that word), Astrid Berges Frisby is very sexy, and Kashish as Salomina, the Indian orphan girl is amazing in her debut. This is as close to a perfect film as I have seen, and I have seen over 10,000 films. There will be two takes on this film from viewers philosophically. There will be those who believe strictly in science, are atheistic, and need proof for any suggestion made by researchers. Then there will be the spiritualists who believe in the possibilities of things other than science and mathematics. I am in the former group, but as an agnostic, I always leave the door a bit ajar for things that cannot be explained easily by science and mathematics. It is films like these that very rarely shake my tree to reconsider other factors. A film not to be missed.",I Origins

To me, it's a very interesting film. The whole idea it tries to portray is very well executed. But I must admit that this film only goes for the idea, it does not have any kind of side stories or stuff, like it's storytelling does not feel like from average movie. You have to watch it yourself to understand what I mean. I do definitely recommend it if you're looking for some serious film.By the way, there is an awesome after credit scene, be sure not to miss that.",I Origins
19,peterp-450-298716,Plain simple ... Brilliant,9,17 April 2015,"There are some movies that browbeat you and after seeing it,you keep pondering over it.Not because of the excellent computer manipulated images,the brilliant acting of one of the main characters or because of the story ingeniously stuffed with strange twists and surprising revelations.But just because of the concept and the deeper meaning behind the story.And the latter definitely counts for ""I Origins"" where the thin boundary between science and the religion is questioned. In hindsight I thought the title of this film is exceptionally and cleverly made up.If you look at the literal meaning of it,you'll find out that it reflects the first part of the whole story.Where did I come from?How did I develop as an individual?In contrast when you pronounce the ""I"",this will sound like ""eye"",which in turn relates to the second part of this film,namely the eye as an organ itself.Now you can interpret this again ambiguous.First of all,the scientific research that Ian performs in regard to the development of the eye in all its aspects.And secondly,there is this saying that our eyes are the windows of the soul.It's one of the most important senses that humans possess.The gift of sight to observe everything that surrounds us,to let us get enchanted by the beauty of everyday life and which enables us to record things and gain knowledge.They are,as it were, windows on the world.And the most important feature is that every person on earth possesses a unique pair of eyes.Ian is a molecular biologist who's irrevocable obsessed by the human eye.The entire purpose of his study is to provide evidence that the eye indeed evolved over the centuries.Something that creationists contradict.They stick to the religiously inspired belief that the whole universe arose from a special divine act of creation. The eye is the one sticking point that religious people use to discredit evolution.Together with the first-year student Karen (Brit Marling),who over-enthusiastically throws herself on a parallel line of thought about creating sight on a creature that lacks that despite million of years of evolution,he delivers a groundbreaking discovery. Meanwhile,Ian has met the mysterious Sofi at a Halloween Party.She possesses a pair of distinct wonderful eyes.This mysterious person becomes Ian's second obsession and is full of strange and outspoken reasonings.Have you ever met someone who immediately starts telling you the story of the Phasianidae?In his spare time Ian photographs the eyes of certain people.Also those of Sofi,who suddenly disappears from his life the same evening.He doesn't realize that this person is going to make him doubt his whole belief system with the concept of reincarnation as central theme.Revealing more about this wonderful film,would be a mortal sin.The best way to experience this film and to let it act on your mind,is by knowing about it as little as possible,like me.I guarantee you that for some it will be an impressive experience and the whole will force you to think about who you are,about your origin and whether spiritual forces exist that affect your human existence.Just as Ian I'm a person who's faith is only based on tangible and provable arguments.I can't persuade myself to give credence to observations by people who have subsequently written those down thousands of years ago.As Ian says: ""These beliefs can not be changed or substantiated by contemporary facts.They are unchangeable"".Could this omniscient and grand higher power exist ? The One who created and controlled everything.Who then again also shows infinite love and wants to take His creatures under his wing ?I can only conclude, if I take the present world into consideration,that He started a part-time job nowadays. But despite my firm conviction it got me pondering about whether or not there exists an overarching power that has a profound impact on our void existence.Sofi beautifully phrased it when she realized what Ian actually tried to achieve in his lab with the blind worms.These creatures aren't aware of the phenomenon of light.And forcing them to mutate,they would be able to understand the concept of light.The theory she suggests,sounds pretty logical when you think more about it.Could it be possible that individuals exist who are mutated in such a way that they are able to comprehend the spiritual world that surrounds us.A comprehension such as light that surrounds the worms. In all honesty,I am convinced that there is something that is beyond our understanding.Thinking back about my near-death experience,that changed my existence in a drastically way,I came to a point where any logical explanation or science-based plea no longer helps.I can only admit that there's more than just pure physical life only.The length of a review is to me a measure of how I experienced a movie. A short text usually indicates a meaningless,best-you-forget-it-as-quickly-as-possible movie.A significant volume means that it touched me and that I witnessed something phenomenal.Enumerating film-technical aspects which befell perfectly or glorifying the concise but also appropriate performances,is of secondary importance since the deeper meaning and message dominates.The entire film is laced with beautiful symbolic moments.The way Ian succeeds in finding Sofi because the same figure is appearing again and again,after which he's confronted with those beautiful eyes staring at him again from a billboard.The conversations between him and Sofi,who obviously has a different perception about religion.The gorgeous equation Ian makes about their failed attempt to get married and the big bang theory,when according to him their atoms already clashed together.And the denouement that takes place in Delhi,India:the epicenter when it comes to astral energy and spiritual sensations.It's no surprise that in the hippie period,many young people flocked to this country to get new impressions and learn about their inner development.All this melted together and gave an unsurpassable result with a moving end,that even left me with a lump in my throat(and supported by the sound of Radiohead).Final Conclusion:A brilliant film and truly recommended.It's surely one that'll end up in my top list!If you get a chance to watch this gem somewhere,please do so !More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",I Origins
20,Enchorde,Peculiar movie with food for thought,6,12 November 2016,"Found this Movie very peculiar. Can't really say if it is in a good or bad way, as the feeling as I watched was more like: This Movie got potential and can develop into something really good, or implode completely. Unfortunately (?) it did neither.This is a loose, sublime and low-key story that wonders of the possibility of some kind of reincarnation. It doesn't really take a stand or try to deliver any kind of answer, but it plants seeds of thought. It makes you think about Life, Death, science and religion and some of life's big questions. And that may be the best thing about the Movie.6/10",I Origins
21,Amyth47,Creative I Forms.,8,24 July 2020,My Rating : 8/10Intentionally poignant filmmaking which aims to give the viewer a more spiritual awakening as opposed to a scientific one.Universal issues addressed in a sensitive and beautiful way few films manage - let alone commercial movie business which aims to spoon-feed viewers agenda.Highest recommendation.,I Origins
22,Seraphion,A highly philosophical concept yet with less dramatic depiction,5,4 December 2014,"The story nicely touches the age old debate between science and religious believes. The movie's main character comfortably takes the position of the all too confident non believer who believes so much in his own scientific explanation of everything in the world. The first act pits him and a complete opposite in a believer as his love interest. It nicely peaks up it's conflict yet it ends the conflict in such an unclear way of storytelling. The second act revisits the main character's position in believes. It presents such a circumstance that makes him not only considering about revisiting his believes but also at the same he's also reluctant due to being steadfast at his principles. Yet again the conflict ends abruptly, only touching simple element of the philosophical side while giving a heavy dose of reminisce from the first act. The acting feels just a little bit below standard, thus the movie seems kind of boring particularly at the first act.",I Origins
23,bkrauser-81-311064,I Origins: I Hated,4,20 October 2015,"""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt in your philosophy."" - Hamlet (Act I Scene 5)I wish I could say that to Mike Cahill who in addition to being the film's director also serves as the sole screenwriter. This movie, if one could call it that, tries to be deep, philosophical and spiritual but winds up feeling pedantic and overwrought. As self- important and over-indulgent as this dreck can possibly be, those hoping for a frank, mesmerizing or lacking any of that accurate take on Eastern religion and philosophy will just have to settle for the cinematic equivalent of a fortune cookie. The emotional stakes of this film are so overwhelmed by the back-breaking acrobatics the film's script does to keep its characters motivated that I couldn't help but find the proceedings unintentionally hilarious.But let's back up: the story starts out rather simply, Ian (Pitt) a biologist studying the evolution of the human eye, falls for perfect specimen, Sofi (Berges-Frisbey) at a Halloween party. He hunts her down because despite not seeing her face that night, he took pictures of her eyes and can identify them with an intensity that most would find creepy. They find each other, fall in love, and eventually make plans to marry. Then she dies tragically. If I wanted to put a spoiler alert I would have put it before that sentence. Years later after a series of increasingly contrived coincidences, Ian discovers that the irises of living people match the irises of the recently deceased and he tracks down Sofi's eyeball doppelganger in the hopes of discovering her possible reincarnation.The idea in itself is not what I find stupid. Well not the stupidest at any rate. There are religions based on the idea of reincarnation and had the movie been better, I could have overlooked the logistical issues with this movie's view on it. Can people be reincarnated as a dog, cat or any other animal? There were points in Earth's history when there weren't as many ""souls"" so how does this movie account for that? Account for sin much; Nope. How about accounting for Dharma instead; Nope.I Origins is just not very developed. Instead of actual story and plot we get a grist of loosely connected ridiculousness tangentially brought to fruition by our protagonist's little explained wanderlust. What are the odds that on the same day a marvelous lab discovery is made our protagonist marries his lady, gets blinded by formaldehyde then witnesses his wife eat it via freak elevator accident. If that's not the tragic backstory of a super-villain, I don't know what is. Years later, after Ian remarries, yet another little explained plot contrivance connects his newborn son to a deceased black dairy farmer in Boise. They find this out only because our protagonist has the funds, free time and inclination to go to Idaho to investigate what could have easily been a stock photo.Then our grief stricken hero travels to India to track down a young girl who shares his former lover's irises in a final hour that leads any casual observer to conclude this guy has serious issues. He searches the streets of Mumbai for weeks and even puts up a billboard to find his lost lover all while being goaded to search by, of all people, his current wife (Marling). But just as he's about to give up, he finds her staring blankly at the freakin' billboard. Well that was lucky! Then the poor little Indian girl follows our hero back to his hotel room and fails his ""scientific"" test. They embrace anyway because ""it feels right,"" never mind the fact that they didn't prove a thing other than people can have the same set of eyes and two American scientists have way too much time on their hands.I feel like I Origins was originally a failed TV pilot. When they knew it wasn't going to sell they shot a few new scenes and re- imagined it into an incredibly overdone piece of fluff disguised as a laconic ""thinker"". Fact is the dialogue was stilted, the actors were all boring to watch and listen to, and as I have previously stated the script is contrived, contrived, contrived! I Origins joins The Fountain (2006) as the dumbest, watered-down, and offensive piece of western appropriation of eastern religious ideas since yoga was introduced to the American public. Turgid, lugubrious, and almost painfully artificial, I Origins is a movie I hated.",I Origins
24,blumdeluxe,Beautiful beginning but what's the point?,6,31 October 2016,"When I began watching this title, I was almost immediately caught by the beautiful acting. What developed before my eyes was an alternative, yet gorgeously presented love story of two strangers that become familiar to each other.Probably my favorite part of the movie are the small details, like the character's fable for photographing eyes, that mix beautifully with the artsy way of filming.But at some point the film lost me. First the kind of bizarre death of the female main character, then the destruction of the just established love story that leads to an end that leaves me a bit unsure what to think.While I get that spiritual things may or may not exist, the end almost seems a bit fanatic to me, especially given that I don't get how it connects to the first part of the movie. You wouldn't need this whole relationship to tell the story and it seems a bit cheap how the beginning establishes details later used for the message.I would certainly rate this one higher if it sticked to how it began. This way I'm still unsure what the agenda of this film is. 6/10.",I Origins
25,vithiet,It may have flaws but it's still interesting.,7,15 December 2020,"This is definitely not for everyone. First, it's one of those slow paced sci-fi movies that is trying to make you think rather than throw visual eye candy at you (which I'm also a fan of, no dissing any sci-fi style here). It also takes quite a few liberties with actual science, but I'm ok with it as long as it serves the narrative and I do think it works in this case. Overall pretty interesting and original so I'd recommend it so you can make your own opinion.",I Origins
26,agmoldham,Interesting movie,6,22 December 2014,"I saw I Origins on a flight. I skipped the movie at the cinema because it seemed similar in concept to a couple of the other major releases of 2014.I have to confess that it was a more enjoyable movie than Transcendence or Lucy which are the films that seemed similar. What's more the film was quite different from those movies as well!I Origins follows the biologist Ian (Michael Pitt) who is obsessed with eyes and the way they have developed across different species. The script is good and there are several different plot threads that keep the interest throughout the movie. The romance between Ian and Sofi (Astrid Burges-Frisby) is particularly nicely played by the 2 actors who have a real on screen chemistry. The movie asks some pretty fundamental questions regarding the beliefs of the viewers, but leaves it for the viewers to draw there own conclusions. Well worth a watch.",I Origins
27,bryank-04844,"Once again, Cahill, Pitt, and Marling have knocked it out of the park with this film.",9,15 August 2015,"Director/writer Mike Cahill instantly became one of my favorite directors with his 2011 film 'Another Earth'. That breakout hit film was so original and beautifully made with an excellent performance by the beautiful Brit Marling and an well crafted screenplay, that it easily made it's way into my Top 10 films of 2011, and is one film that I still watch often three years later. Now we are in 2014 and Cahill has delivered his second movie called 'I Origins', and I'm here to tell you that it's as every bit of good that you are hoping for.Cahill has crafted yet another screenplay and story that is very original and has used his unique and beautiful directing style to capture the life of a biologist who studies eyes and is looking or not looking for something bigger than himself. Every frame of the film matters and how Cahill used his camera to capture his characters and locations was truly amazing. It's not everyday that you go to the movies and see something so beautiful and awesome on screen that you think about it for days on end, but that's what 'I Origins' did to me.Cahill's film, much like 'Another Earth' had very big ideas and very strong undertones, but he told these stories in such a way, that it never seemed pretentious or overly done. And while the both have that indie charm and feel, it still appeals to the mainstream audience, which is a difficult feat for any director to do, but Cahill seems to do this flawlessly.Michael Pitt plays a biologist named Ian, who studies eyes for a living and is working on finding a gene that could potentially cure blindness. In the first scene, he is at a Halloween party where he meets a girl in a ninja mask named Sofi (Astrid Bergès- Frisbey), where he can only see her eyes. He notices that they are extremely beautiful and asks to photograph them, which leads to the two of them having sex in the bathroom and Sofi leaving him there with his pants down, literally.Meanwhile back at the lab, Karen (Brit Marling), a first year medical student, is Ian's new lab assistant, and is calm, cool, beautiful, and very ambitious on finding a cure by going through literally every species of animal, looking for that one special gene. Ian eventually finds Sofi again and the two hit it off and begin dating. While Ian believes there is no God and that everything has a logical explanation, Sofi believes there is something deeper and more meaningful in people. While the two disagree about Ian's work, the two are fondly in love.But a fatal accident occurs during the first part of the film, which hits you harder than you might think, due to Cahill's excellent storytelling and direction, as we cut seven years later to present day where Ian and Karen are now married and have a very young infant son. Ian now is a famous scientist due to him and Karen finding that special gene and seem to be happy, even though it is clear that Ian is clearly not completely over Sofi, which Karen accepts in an odd way.Since it is present day now, a scientist has developed and implemented a database of people's eyes as a recognition and security system, where tons of citizen's eyes are photographed, charted on a map, and put into a system. Ian and Karen take their son to get some tests done, and after the test yields interesting results, Ian starts to believe that the eyes are more for just seeing what's in front of you, but rather a link to a connection system to our souls from one person to another person.He looks up Sofi's eyes in this database and sees that she checked into an airport over in India a few days ago, which is impossible. But Ian heads to India to look for someone who has the same eyes as Sofi did and to see if they have any similar characteristics or traits that Sofi did. The results will send chills up your spine as Cahill dives into the metaphysical and spiritual world of our souls and a higher power. It just might make you believe in something larger than yourself.Pitt has been in mainstream films to very indie movies and all the way to television, and he still proves that he is a great leading man who passes as a biologist who loves and is trying to find meaning. Marling, as always is a true gem on the big screen, and Frisbey plays her role with charm and ease. Even in the last part of the film, the young Kashish, who plays a young Indian girl is excellent. The music of the film is perfect too, using songs from Radiohead to set the tone. 'I Origins' is one of the best film of the year and is a must-see. It is a conversation piece and the scene after the credit sequence ends, sets the stage for something much much bigger in the future. Once again, Cahill, Pitt, and Marling have knocked it out of the park with this film.",I Origins
28,witster18,"immediately I know most detractors are going to disagree with it philosophically, and dislike the scaled/dumbed-down science",8,9 January 2015,"Basically ruining the brilliance, heart, and performances that lie beneath ""I Origins"". This is an amazing film. It asks a lot of the viewer: suspension of belief(s), patience, open- mindedness. The film won't be for everyone, but to those with an open heart and open mind you will find one of the most satisfying journeys in months perhaps yrs at the redbox. Some detractors talked about a lack of character development - what freakin' film did they watch?The acting is strong, the camera work is superb, the story gains steam, the music is awesome.. everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't think I would get along with people who hated this film - it's about hope, love, and the limitless, infinite possibilities of creation, evolution, fate, and death. My religious beliefs do not line-up with this work, but i wouldn't dare keep those beliefs from letting me enjoy a film like this. A real sci-fi dramatic gem. Highly, highly recommended. Best film I've seen out of 40 so far in 2015. A shoe-in for top 10 of the yr!84/100 You'll like this if you liked:tree of life(not as good - oh that will get some not usefuls), gattaca(slightly below)and uncertainty(not as good).

29,petarmatic,Original I Origins,7,17 January 2015,"For some time I did not watch film which had this freshness in it. For a short time I had to pay attention and use my brain, which in big Hollywood blockbusters I usually do not have to. They serve everything on a plate.When it comes to science it really can make a difference, when you make an original film like this. It has sci fi elements in it, acting is excellent, plot very well developed.If you want to watch an interesting independent film, with science theme and sci fi elements in it, this is a film for you. I still recommend it for you to relax and get mellow. A perfect film for that!",I Origins
30,kuarinofu,"Amateur hipster ""sci-fi""",3,5 September 2021,"'I Origins' has only one redeeming quality which is the ending pseudo-closure scene.Everything else in this film is incredibly overrated. I'm can endure pretentious hipster dialogue about supposedly 'clever' things, but almost every aspect of the film feels simulated.It's like they are substituting a powerful life-long love story with a sex-addicted passion-fueled short-term relationship. They build up a conflict between religion and science in the most simplistic way while the 'science' part is simulated by glasses and stretched assumptions.While the dialogue is unbearable at times due to its hipster essence, the plot goes off the rails due to unclear motivation and unbelievable coincidences (or god's hand in the film's interpretation). The third act altogether is based on our main lead's 7-year-old sexual attraction to a beautiful woman which again coincides with all his life's work as a pseudo-scientist. I mean, why? Why is the ending hinting at a 'closure' that he finally got, when the original girl was nothing for him but a woman to sleep with. She didn't seem to care about him as well, she was manipulative and selfish.I feel bad for his non-character science partner and occasional wife, cause I'm sure that if the Indian girl will grow to be a beautiful woman he will surely abandon his by-chance wife and the kid, who is a reincarnated farmer, they clearly mean nothing to him. Maybe she doesn't care as much since they had no real relationship and he only used her for sex since his previous passion had an accident.I mean, the main guy is ignorant and despicable.The whole film is based on ground-level shallow unrefined emotions, it's like our grown-up characters never stop to reflect on their actions for a second.I'm sure this will work well with some parts of general audiences the lives of which are governed only by emotions and the critical part of their brain never kicks in.Final summation: shallow, groundless hipster pseudo-sci-fi that tries to trick you into 'deep themes' and 'strong emotions'.",I Origins
31,MattyGibbs,Interesting and affecting Sci-Fi drama,8,28 December 2015,"A scientist discovers a significant discovery that cold affect how people view the world. This film is pretty slow to get going and requires some patience however for me it did give a good payoff. Although laboured at times it's an interesting concept and did keep me interested in what would happen. The story is held together by a superb performance by Michael Pitt in a difficult role. Excellent support is provided by Brit Marling. Unlike a lot of Sci-Fi films, this one has a really good emotional ending. Whilst this film won't hold mass appeal it should strike a cord with people looking for some intelligent Sci-Fi. Worth watching.",I Origins

He finds his work permeating his life after a brief encounter with an exotic young woman (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) who slips away from him. As his research continues years later with his lab partner Karen (Brit Marling), they make a stunning scientific discovery that has far reaching implications and complicates both his scientific and spiritual beliefs.

34,rooee,Another earthly delight from Cahill and Marling,8,13 November 2014,"Writer-director Mike Cahill's last feature was Another Earth. Secretly, it was one of the best films of 2011. And gosh darn it, he his muse Brit Marling might've gone and done it again. It'll no doubt be maligned for being po-faced and overreaching. But I just think Cahill has something big to say and he really, really means it.This is another admirably high-minded slice of lo-fi sci-fi, which again raises deep philosophical questions about the nature of human existence. Michael Pitt plays Ian, a young scientist who teams up with Marling's Karen in an effort to prove that eyes have evolved in nature – as opposed to having been intelligently designed – as a means of discrediting religious belief once and for all. Meanwhile, Ian meets the love of his life, Sofi (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), and events take a devastating turn. This is where I'll stop with the plot. Just know that the story takes so many unexpected byways that a full synopsis would be unavoidably spoilerific.Though I Origins lacks the simple boldness of Another Earth, it ultimately emerges equally profound. There's complexity and drudgery and frustration in scientific research, and this film is not ashamed to remind us of that. Some slightly on-the-nose science/religion debates aside, the script is hugely intelligent and intricate. Sure, the dialogue might not be for everyone, often sounding more like the mutual musings of modern-day philosophers than enraptured lovers, but it tells one heck of a story. A story that feels necessary.This is the work of an auteur. Cahill's ability to evoke atmosphere in the most unassuming locations reaches a new richness here, and his editing is heartbreakingly elegant, particularly in the numerous montage sequences. The visuals are bound together by a quietly luscious ambient score, furnishing the film with a dream-like flow. We even get the odd slo-mo flourish, but it's always style in the service of substance.The performances are excellent across the board. For a start, we believe that these people could do science – a basic flaw in many a film before which has emphasised the ""fi"" at the expense of the ""sci"". And, crucially, the chemistry between Pitt and Berges-Frisbey is as convincing a depiction of the thrill of dawning love as you'll ever see. It's reminiscent at times of those lovely glimpses of the fateful lovers we saw in Steven Soderbergh's very fine Solaris remake.Watch I Origins and be challenged, drained, elevated, and possibly changed. Then delve into Brit Marling's filmography. While the Woodleys and Lawrences of Hollywood get the headlines, hers is the star that rises best, if not brightest. This, The East, Arbitrage, The Sound of My Voice, Another Earth: it's a mini-movement in the American indie scene, and it just keeps delivering.",I Origins
35,room102,Love story and science vs. religion,5,6 December 2014,"Love story and science vs. religion. Result: mehThe first part of the movie is the love story between a scientist and a woman. Where does it all lead to, you ask yourself? The answer is in the second part, which goes full retard and reveals what the director/writer was aiming for: Trying to ""prove"" spirituality/religion by means of science. If you take anything in this movie seriously, you've been spiritually brainwashed and polluted by religion.Good acting, good atmosphere.

36,fciocca,"Conceptually an interesting movie, but practically boring and inconsistent",4,22 November 2019,"A colleague of mine suggested me this movie. He told me that it was one of the best film that he ever watch, so I was very curious about it. I did not watch the trailer and I avoided every wikipedia and IMDb pages, I just had a generic plot told by my friend, but that's it.The movie put in conflict religion and science, the world of the myth, against the world of facts and pure rationality. It does that in a different and original way, and should have been the main core of the movie, but instead it takes only a small portion, and is a topic that is not deepen enough in my opinion. The director left too much space on screen on a useless love story that is completely incoherent and that ends in a really tragic way for no reason at all. The latest 40 minutes of the movie are the most interesting and most coherent with the plot. From ""I Origins"", I was expecting something that tells me a story about the origin of mankind, or that explains how we are all linked. The truth is that the plot is misleading, as well as the title. Casting choices are good, but this is the only good point.Maybe I am not able to appreciate this kind of movie, it depends on my personal taste. I found it boring, and I was wondering when was going to finish. I almost gave up. The ending is really disappointing.",I Origins
37,dallasryan,Can't Disprove It,8,26 August 2017,"Well first off, the acting is superb. Michael Pitt is one of the most underrated actors out there, he's terrific as always. Astrid Berges- Frisbey is amazing as the free spirited girl that we all want to attain. Her character reminds one of Kate Winslet's character in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Brit Marling is good as the 'safe' choice. However, Marling is a great actress, and has been better. The chemistry between Pitt and Frisbey though is amazing. The passion is right there as we have all felt that kind of passion in a relationship or two, or within a deep dream we've had. Cahill writes such a magnificent script, a great writer he is. He puts such amazing and thought provoking analogies(touching on butterfly effect, reincarnation, miracles, destiny, God, etc.) in this film without compromising the film itself i.e. the film is never contrived in any of the analogies that are used where in a lesser film trying to use analogies like Cahill did would come off contrived. As the film says, you can't prove it, but you can't disprove it. What a wild and food for thought concept that we could be reincarnated and the eyes could be the proof. The iris recognition only recognizes (as far as we know) maybe 5 million or more people in the world. Out of those people who knows whose eyes might or might not come up as someone else's who died(and if they did, we would never hear about it, it would be kept under wraps). But just imagine if 7 billion people had the iris recognition, who knows who may or may not have someone else's eyes and indeed be reincarnated. Absolutely brilliant, brilliant! Again, Like the character says 'you can't prove it, but you can't disprove it either.' After the credits roll, there is an extra scene that provides more food for thought, however I could have done without this scene, in a way it kind of took a little bit away from the magic and mysticism of this film, but at the same time it wasn't too bad either as it was interesting and could have been true as well as Iris Recognition first began(they say) in the late 1920's. Mike Cahill directed and wrote a beauty here, his opus. I Origins is a wonderful, beautiful film that is most definitely worth watching.",I Origins
38,the_wolf_imdb,"Hipster-class ""scifi""",1,7 April 2015,"I have expected a lot from this movie. A lot of people have praised it as a great movie that literally blows the Hollywood out of water. I'm shocked into disbelief how the public today can assume the movie is clever and spiritual even if it is so incredibly shallow and stupid. Maybe they got confused by the cool soundtrack and the fact the actors do wear glasses.Well. The movie has a lot of very bad flaws. For the start it is insanely boooooring. Basically there is nothing going on for almost two hours. It is not surprising, there are not twists. Not a single one. Well there is an elevator. So we know someone is going to die here, it is obvious at least five minutes earlier. We do know the scientist will go full spiritual, it is obvious at least one and half hour earlier. ""I have been hipster scientist and now I'm hipster believer."" This level of shallowness is just stunning.The movie is not emotional. It has same level of emotions as displayed in ""Melancholia"", ""Her"" or ""Another Earth"" - I do mean there is just single emotion, which is kinda mixed out of passivity, longing, sadness and guilt.The movie is not scientific. The level of science displayed in this movie is analogous to the Penny in the Big Bang Theory: You will let the actors to wear glasses and to say ""molecules"". Well, here is the ""science"".The movie is incredibly pretending, shallow and stupid. It completely focuses on surface and totally abandons any attempt to make anything clever. Cool camera, cool haircuts, cool sadness, one single emotion, completely absurd premises. What has happened to the public that this is applauded as a great scifi flick? What about ""Memento"", ""Blade Runner""? ""The Moon""? ""The Box""? Those are great and deep scifi movies.This is just movie analog of Starbucks decaf vanilla latte: It looks cool but it is not coffee anymore. It already lost all the qualities and it only resembles greatness.",I Origins
39,Dragonsouls,Brilliant.,8,19 March 2015,"I was so moved by the theology in this film, and I can only wonder what motivates Mike Cahill and Brit Marling to write such thought provoking material. This film was beautiful, the dialog wondrous, and the performances were superb by every cast member. I always wondered about reincarnation, retro-cognition, and genetic memories and this film explores the topics in such a moving, emotional way. The script for this film was crafted in a way so that the viewer formulates their own opinions on what they have seen. I was particularly moved by the insinuation that autistic people may be old-souls. This is one of the most enlightening films I've ever seen.",I Origins
40,GraXXoR,This physicist approves,10,5 June 2021,"I really love the way they wove science into their tale in a way that blurred the lines between what we actually know and what is merely conjecture in a believable way.String theory, Genetic Modification and even Eugenics... All handled plausibly and eloquently.For me, the line ""as long as we don't choose, everything remains possible"" was outstanding and brought on a shiver of anticipation.This tale is beyond science fiction and falls well into the speculative science category.",I Origins

I was seriously asked the other day ""why I hated god"" so after that ramble the film. I did not mind the film and it's very pro reincarnation message, the gist of the story being that people are born with the same iris recognition pattern as someone who had died and they inherited some of the person's memories. I think the idea of reincarnation is pointless, if you are reincarnated with memories of a previous life as a rule most of your loved one's will be dead and would result in some serious psychological problems, if you are reincarnated without previous memories you are essentially a different person.So the film well acted decent story line and here is a thought what is the girl had trapped her hand in a lift door and that is the reason she does not like lifts?",I Origins

It permeates the destiny of the main characters, apparently in the background of their sentimental life, which by the way is depicted in a passionate and very believable way.But in the end what they really want is to know the truth, no matter what it would be, and I found it fascinating! Of course I understand that this entire plot may be boring to death if you don't put the struggle among mankind and superstitions at the top of your interestsIn any case, and whatever could have been the final: who could have not possibly loved and cared for Salomina?

43,santiagocosme,Watch it in this life or another!,7,23 December 2014,"I won't go around the bush with my verdict. This is a movie that you should definitely watch. It reminded me of ""Café de Flore"" as both share the same subject, but in ""I Origins"", the director tries to find a scientific answer to the question. Is there another life after death? The story is delectable, and makes you wonder if there could be some truth in it. Of course, the innocence that comes from not being a scientist does help in this case. I am pretty sure that real molecular biologist would take this as a bit of a comedy. So, if you work or are in anyways related to this scientific field (or other scientific fields), you may want to stay away from this movie. To me, the only real ""but"" came from the cast. Michael Pitt never really seems to be convincing as a scientist, and the Argentinian/French girl he fancies could come across to some as an ""annoying-know it all"" woman. Also, the lab partner seems to have a personality shift half way through the movie which is never a good thing.In any case, if you are willing to excuse the director for this and for some scenes that are a bit nonsensical or mundane, I am pretty confident that ""I Origins"" will be your money's worth. At least the subject is quite intriguing and you don't see that many movies these days that try something different.",I Origins
44,lucasnochez,Film Review: I Origins/www.nightfilmreviews.com,9,24 July 2014,"""What would you do if something spiritual disproved your scientific beliefs?"" Science and spirituality is at the forefront of Mike Cahill's second directorial feature. If that doesn't already excite you, perhaps you have never had those intense, elongated conversations about either or both of the subjects. Two of the most divisive subjects in human history are the real stars of Cahill's second film; a promising feature centered on bold claims, knowledge and questioning.In 2011, Mike Cahill premiered his feature length debut Another Earth at the Sundance Film Festival to mixed reviews. In 2012, I was able to finally enjoy Another Earth and became acquainted with one of the most promising American indie film directors working today. Three years after his life-altering debut feature, I Origins proves to be a personal cinematic study of bravado that questions whether science or spirituality is the true way to prove the existence of human beings.I Origins doesn't quite reach the level of Another Earth, but it does get to within reach in bold and dramatic fashion.Cahill is faithful to a cast that has served him well in previous endeavors. He recasts indie darling Brit Marling as Karen, a sophisticated scientist who works faithfully next to Ian Gray (the always impressive Michael Pitt). Together, using iris scanning and sophisticated technological advancements of scientific study, the two become lab rats obsessed with the intent of disproving the existence of a spiritual being greater than the human race.It becomes clear that Ian has a skeptical view of spirituality. Cahill, who never labels his protagonists and steers away from religion whenever possible, offers up well thought out arguments for both beliefs and Ian's distrust in anything pertaining to the soulfulness of humanity. Ian's life is anything but black and white, especially once he gazes upon a billboard and into the eyes of a beautiful woman by the name of Sofi (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey). Ian looks for Sofi, and upon first gaze, the two fall in love. For some, I Origins may be mistaken as an eternal love-story based on the first act. But through a surprising sequence of unexpected tragedy, the film takes an unexpected turn into the deep observation of chance and possibility. What begins for Ian is a new phase in his life where, like Dr. Frankenstein, he plays God using science, together with his lab partner and own personal Igor, Karen, dictates and questions his very beliefs to his core. Through this, I Origins becomes an endless fable of answer seeking for Ian. The answers, however, are never revealed to the audience. Over the next few years, Ian becomes a seemingly ordinary family man. Under the surface, he evolves into a pioneer in his research and studies. The film offers many unanswered questions as well as an abundance of coincidences that take away any authenticity of the screenplay's flow. This aside, Cahill retains his audience's curiosity when Ian finds a match of his beloved Sofi's unique eyes in India with a little home-less Indian girl Salomina (Kashish). What begins for Ian is the key to unlocking the connection between the past lives of people living, dead and the memories that they believe are retained through iris patterns. The film is given momentum and brought to new life in the third and exhilarating final act.Since its premiere at Sundance this year, I Origins has been my most anticipated indie of 2014, and I could happily say that I did not disappoint. Kept together with an ensemble effort by its cast, lead by the poignant Pitt, Marling and Steven Yuen of AMC's The Walking Dead for good measure, the film becomes one of the loudest commentaries of the year for spirituality and science without ever answering too much and leaving one to make their own decisions.Originality is the basis of Cahill's film and the mantra of his filmmaking technique. Eyeing the greater picture of narrative and inciting cinephiles, intellects and storytellers, I Origins is a bold voice of the future of magnificent independent feature films. Much like Ian itself, there is always a grey area of doubt, and perhaps, the film may hit an emotional and personal chord with people who have strong faiths or strong beliefs in the use of data and proof. Thankfully, I Origins does nothing to prove either subject as a favourite or underdog. Instead, the film offers a platform for intense conversation and analysis well after the final credits roll.Art is one of the largest catalysts towards asking the unanswerable and questioning the unbelievable. Cahill's film style could be best described as a cinematic lens into the reality of grand human perception. Ambitious and wholly entertaining, I Origins may very well be one of the longest talked about films of the year and surely the most talked about indie film of the summer. Writer/director Cahill may make films that need to be seen with your eyes, but his soulful approach to filmmaking is one that asks audiences to open their hearts and reconfigure their minds to new, promising and fascinating questions that can drive the future narrative of great cinema for years to come.",I Origins
45,hoytyhoyty,I waited 1 hour 47 minutes ... for that?,1,21 December 2014,"Without a doubt, one of the most idiotic films I have ever accidentally watched. It was like eating a lovely chocolate cake, then finding it hollow and full of cardboard as one dug deeper, then finding a dog turd at the centre of it.This director, Mike Cahill, desperately wants to be Shane Carruth (creator of the brilliant films 'Primer' and 'Upstream Color').He isn't.There were so many points throughout this film where I nearly turned it off, but the Ambient Piano Montage style - completely derivative, and ripped off from Carruth's films and others - kept me believing it had a punch-line.It didn't.I tried hard to follow the 'science' - I have a heavy computer-science and physics background, professionally, and I've always been fascinated by evolutionary biology, especially molecular genetics. I was sure there was a core there of 'something': a something that would transcend the pseudo-science gobbledegook and liberate this film into brilliance.There wasn't.And finally, as it got very close to the end, I prayed - oh yes I prayed, to the gods of Auteurship - that they would not bring all this mumboid jumboid rubbish to bear, forcing the main character into a completely, literally impossible impasse. And thereby copping out with a cinema-wrecking bang.They did.Forget the dime-a-dozen performances, forget the plagiarised cinematography, and - please - forget the laughable script. I Origins, I can say after due observation and analysis, is truly - in the immortal words of Bill Hicks - a piece of sh*t.Don't waste my time like this again Mr. Cahill.- -- ---",I Origins

What makes this film a good one for me is it's originality and how clever it is. I love sci fi movies especially when it's a story what no one has ever thought up. The actors played their parts very well and from what I can remember there really weren't any dull moments in this film. Now, there's no action or anything like that, there's just drama and a little sci fi suspense.

48,eyeintrees,"Great idea, good actors, BUT...",5,24 January 2015,"Hmmm... where to begin. Firstly, for one hour and six minutes we see two people sucking each other's faces virtually ongoing; this was phenomenally boring to the point where I was about to quit and go and make a baked dinner or something, but just as I was about to go the thing got some life into it and after a horrible accident we actually begin to have a script, and far less face sucking, real events began to occur other than the bubble wrapped around to co-dependent boring people. Somewhere in amongst that sheer boredom there were a couple of lines about reincarnation and god and souls and the real reason why the movie was apparently made.The acting was good and the actors were very good, carrying this lame duck along keeping it alive by sheer force of being believable. The idea was exceptional but it really got dreadfully lost except for some tasty morsels thrown in now and again which gave one the idea that someone had a clue what they were talking about.There were about two really good lines. One a requote of Dalai Lama and something else, but all in all if the actors had not been good and the direction, then this would have dived to about a two for me.If you're interested in the subject matter: reincarnation, souls, afterlife, greater Universal Law, and things of that nature, I suggest you go and borrow a lot of good books from the library and give this poor effort a miss.",I Origins

The concept delves deep into the philosophical, ethical and all around mind blowing theory, melding it with what could very well be the best storyline to fit the concept. Really, how great this movie is, just simply cannot be put into words.So what I will say is more on what it made me feel. From the minute it began, I was entranced by the film. It felt both slow burn and fast paced at the same time. Both awkward in its shots, yet adding to its charm. And both heart breaking and exciting in its own right. This is something few, if any, films have made me feel and this feeling, I must say, is absolutely indescribable. You would simply have to watch it to understand.P. S.

They then engineered his spectacles off in the lab so that she could stupidly accidentally get formaldehyde in his eyes so that they could then get into the ricketiest and probably illegal elevator in New York so that she could die and maybe get reincarnated according to her own spiritual belief system.There are several plot flaws such as why on earth did the two married scientists not contact the specialist conducting the tests on children with iris pattern matches. Instead, flying off to India on a wild goose chase.Stylistically it's very nice, with beautiful actors, including the lovely Archie Panjabi from The Good Wife, pretty photography, appropriate incidental music.

55,thespeos,"No. No. Uh, no.",1,30 April 2021,"After watching 1,000s upon 1,000s of movies over 40+ years, I've come up with some basic rules. These rules arose from my experience and maturing.I've watched movies that span 1930 - 2020, 70 years of history, culture, and generational differences. While there are vast differences in culture over these 70 years, my rules generally apply well, regardless. Here are two:>> #1 - If the movie passes the 20 minute sniff test, I'll watch til the end. Note: Just because I watch the whole film does not mean I recommend it, e.g. ""Donnie Darko."" It just means there was merit in the film, and wanted to see it through.>> #2 - If the movie begins with sex or violence it's likely a stinker. 98% of the time this is true, but there are rare exceptions, e.g. ""Blade"", ""Sin City"", etc. (You might be thinking I'm a prude, or that I've never had great or spontaneous sex.)My chief problem with this film is that it breaks rule #2. What's the big deal about opening with sex or violence? It tells me that the writer either: A) has a poor sense of the art of subtleties, and / or B) the writer is young or promiscuous and wants to satisfy his own lust or that of his audience. (Note: A female writer is far less likely to open a film with erotic sex or brute violence. This is partly why most film is grossly biased toward males, and thus inept at sustaining subtleties.)Largely, in my experience, the generation this film appeals to considers sex to be part of normal casual interaction, like having a cup of coffee, e.g. ""Hey there Alissa, you wanna grab a cup of coffee or just go f**k?"" Not only does this offend me for treating the most intimate act so casually, it lacks grace.There are good movies with appropriately erotic scenes, e.g. ""Basic Instinct"" where the sex is not only appropriate, it is necessary to express the primal power of sex ... even in the midst of serious moral conflict. (He's a cop screwing his main suspect. See the problem here?)Some of you probably don't care, others actually relish this, and still others hear my ""rule #2"" as stifling art. Fair. Nonetheless, this film breaches an artistic boundary that has generally worked for me.So no. No. And, no.",I Origins

With that being said I do have a gripe with the ""science"" in the movie. As someone with a background in science I know that most of the things that are being presented as ""facts"" in this movie are nothing but humbug. You can't create iris scans from ""high res"" images. And that's not the only pseudo-science that's prevalent in ""I Origins"". But I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just end it here.The movie was OK but I can't help but feel a little disappointed. I was expecting something very different; a movie about the origin of self / consciousness. But instead we've watched a movie about eyes. Very funny play of words (/sarcasm).

Most of it is interesting and intriguing but there are times I have to admit the details were lost on me.The director gave us ""Another Earth"" which is also a sort of dreamy sci-fi netherworld. I don't think all things in his films are meant to be understood but rather felt. Retina photos are like fingerprints which allow a scientist to identify people anywhere in the world. That, in fact, is where this film takes him as he studies and makes conclusions based on people's eyes.I thought things were jumping around in time but discovered there is only some of that going on. This film will require your full concentration to get what is happening. At the same time, if you open yourself up to the film, I think you will be pleased with it and its final result. Because it will not appeal to traditional audiences who prefer more simple answers, it loses a couple of points.

Science adds new discoveries and corrects old theories constantly as it progresses. What's this have to do with ""I, Origins""? It's one of the main themes of the movie: What if there's more to the universe than what we can perceive with our senses. Ask any real scientist and you'll find out that the concept is hardly new or controversial. We can't directly perceive radio waves or x-rays yet we make use of them every day. Nevertheless, this movie approaches the topic in a way that makes this question, perhaps, easier to approach for non-scientists.Similarly, the movie tackles the theme of science versus religion. This theme is played up a lot in contemporary press coverage and ""I, Origins"" tackles this question intelligently as well. Again, ask a scientist about science and religion and you will likely find out that there isn't really a conflict between the two. Science looks into how the universe works. Religion is concerned with why? ""How"" and ""why"" are two sides of the same coin.The movie also explores the long-existing notion that we are in some way tied to certain individuals for all time. Soul mates, if you will. Don't ask a scientist about that one.The main actors in ""I, Origins"" are young and beautiful. Even the lab rat, played by Brit Marling, who starred in director Mike Cahill's prior and debut film ""Another Earth,"" cannot hide her exceptional beauty behind glasses and sweats or a pregnancy suit. So if you enjoy seeing beautiful people asking seemingly profound questions in interesting settings, this is your movie.Like Cahill's ""Another Earth,"" this movie probes profound questions about the human existence. It's beautifully shot (though I think it needs some more editing), well acted by attractive people, and in the end will probably get you thinking.

When i was at uni (far too long ago now), we had the pleasure to meet with one of the guys developing the prototype of the FBI's iris scanning system. As an aside, that version had an infra-red component to allow the scanner to make sure the eye was alive. All the data was stored in a massive database, and they could compare them all. Just like in the movie, in fact. There was a 1 in 10 million level of discrimination, not 1 in 7 billion.So. Reality check aside. Let's pretend their cameras were heaps better in the movie, and its all true like they said. And let's pretend that you can evolve a human sized eyeball on a worm, just so the laboured point of disproving the need for god stands on its own.This is a lovely movie about a die-hard atheist. A scientist obsessed with proving that god is not needed. Who meets someone who claims to see with an extra sense (a third eye, one must assume), who captures his heart, and then dies in an excruciating to watch way. (i had to leave the room when it looked like it was about to happen, and only came back after my partner's screams had stopped). He then gets put into a place when God gets a chance to open those doors of perception and lead him into the light. (The bit with the guy in the hat making him uncomfortable so he first takes the stairs up to the hotel room was quite neat. He really was doing God's work!)).Cue fade to end.The filmmaker wisely did not go any further with the movie, after our dear protagonist's conversion, for what more is needed?

Basically it consists of irritatingly cutsie baby-faced actors poorly imitating intelligent scientists engaged in deep philosophical conversation. The way the actors interact with each other and their environment barely resembles reality. The romance is shallow and cringe-worthy, like something a preteen would think up: Anonymous hook-ups and stalking somehow portrayed as an appealing, convincing backdrop to a life-changing romance.The main character is a scientist who has exactly two coworkers, and zero managers or bosses or advisors, throughout his entire career, and can fly around the world at a moments notice on a whim.Usually I'm not one to criticize the ""science"" in a movie like this, but they didn't even try! In the end it comes down to a guy randomly finding a little girl on the street, (of course she's the right girl, of course she speaks English!) and dragging her into a hotel, and no one raises an eyebrow at this. Then he gives her a multiple choice test in the most biased and error-prone way imaginable.

Statistically, that would impressive if there wasn't someone emotionally attached to the outcome and who knows all the right answers, staring at the test-taker in the face while they make their choices.Then the ending is open-ended in a way that is intended to be though-provoking and deep, but actually is anti-climactic.Okay, so now that my ranting is out of the way, actually the movie isn't that bad. It has some touching moments occasionally, its worth watching if you're bored. But the ending leaves much to be desired, it feels unfinished, and overall the movie just seems like its geared to appeal to preteens whose brains are not fully formed and don't really have a fleshed-out concept of how the adult-world works.",I Origins
68,yada2121,A thought provoking movie,8,18 December 2015,"While there are plenty of errors displayed while telling the story about the scientific process, I found the basic premises of this movie very believable. I rink we have all had enough experiences in our lives to imagine that reincarnation, or a rationale for certain vivid deju vu moments, that we experience, is there not scientific evidence today that attempts to explain that chemical patterns in the brain can generate specific memories and thought patterns that are beyond the control of the individual? Which could explain why some people are naturally more empathetic than others? As a scientific minded person with religious beliefs also, I believe it possible that we may have lived before our present lives. I don't have indisputable proof. But, the possibility seems plausible to me based on my own life experiences and observing those of others around me. I found this movie to be very thought provoking and useful in opening my eyes to other explanations of the origin of life.",I Origins
69,BestBenedikt,Almost as astonishingly stupid as THE HAPPENING,2,17 March 2019,"Wow, I really had no idea that I would dislike this film as much as I did. This is one of those rare cases where a movie tries to convey a meaningful and though-provoking narrative, but ends up being mind-bogglingly stupid. In that regard I ORIGINS strongly reminded me of Shyamalan's THE HAPPENING.The characters here are written incredibly stereotypical and shallow. Aside from being generally miscast, the protagonist is as cliched as an atheist scientist can be, always relying on facts and wanting to prove religion wrong in an aggressively intrusive way. What follows, is a superficial relationship with a spiritual-minded foreign girl, who also happens to have a French accent (because why not). The 26-year-old student and his hipster girlfriend then get married after knowing each other for what seems like five days, and events unfold in the most unoriginal way possible.While the cinematography here at times looks quite unprofessional, the writing is the real star of the movie. The relationship portrayed in the first half of the film seems like the wet dream of a semi-depressive 16-year-old with no life experience whatsoever. Similar to that, the movie-""science"" is really just the peg for the story about identical irises and even laughable at times - when the scientist's first-semester lab partner makes a scientific breakthrough within the first few days of work for example. To top things off, some side character is a dairy farmer, whose surname is actually Dairy ... I'll stop now.Unfortunately and unlike THE HAPPENING, this film wasn't so bad it's good, even if it occasionally had some unintentional humour going for it. The stupidity of I ORIGINS was rather agonizing and made it a particular boring watch.",I Origins

What a stupid joke!This film is supposed to be Sci-Fi, but it is actually not! Another insulting joke!A research student, Ian Gray (played by Michael Pitt), has a scientific bent of mind who believes only in Proofs – not some fictitious Intelligent Design to explain away the world around us.He comes in contact with Sofi (Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey) who is mystical-minded and a theist. Her exotic eyes became the center of Ian's attraction. From here on, the film became less about human eye evolution and more about matching of Iris scans of known diseased people with others in a database, for a possibility of Reincarnation. The so-called Scientist in Ian Gray mutates into a ""hippy"".""I Origins"" clearly comes across as a pretentious, shallow film based on this Frivolous idea! Phewwhat a waste of time.On second thoughts, even with this ""frivolous idea"" the film could have been made more thrilling and engaging. It is the Presentation which matters more than the Idea.

Especially because Brit Marling stars in it again - maybe one of the most underrated actresses today. My expectations were met. I Origins provokes atheists and evidence-based scientists by providing us with a story of a scientist that starts to question the existence of something metaphysical. Being an atheist myself, I nonetheless detest how self-righteous atheists try to debunk everything religious or - even more arrogant - metaphysical. You might call me a humble atheist, since I don't have the urge to preach my way of looking at the world to other people, nor do I feel better than those who believe in something transcendent. Because of all that, I love I Origins. Not because it convinces me of reincarnation, afterlife or God, but because it shows that spiritualism isn't affected by science and therefore even hardcore atheists are susceptible to it. So while this movie is obviously sci-fi, it feels very real and even hopeful. The wonderful soundtrack, dreamy images and slow paced build-up create a majestic movie experience, just like Cahill's Another Earth. I was quite surprised to hear he's planning a sequel to I Origins, but I must admit the post-credits scene captures the imagination and a second feature that'll elaborate on that, will be most welcome. Highly recommended!",I Origins

76,mingsphinx,An original though flawed take on the transmigration of souls,7,20 February 2015,"Movies with mystical/religious themes tend to be absurd. But this film succeeds in presenting a fundamentally undefinable idea in a coherent and provocative manner. What if there was more to our reality than time and space? What if this extra bit (some call it soul) moves from one body to the next when we die? To enjoy this film, you must not dismiss outright the notion that there is something beyond our physical universe. Unlike other movies, to watch this one you have to go beyond suspending your beliefs to actually having an open mind. In other words, if you are not willing to entertain the idea of soul, then give this movie a pass because there are no mind boggling special effects or frightening scenes that will scare you into forgetting your present troubles.The acting and camera work was decent although not all the scenes were relevant to the narrative. It would have been preferable if Astrid Bergès-Frisbey did not keep trying to cover her breasts in the love scene and there were probably angles that could have been used which would have hidden from view the fact that both actors had their undergarments on, but they did their best and that makes it okay. The argument presented in the movie was flawed because massive assumptions were made on the relationship between the body, soul and memory.

I mean, not necessarily, because I am a fan of Cloud Atlas per say, but there was something unnatural about I Origins and especially its meaning. I did realize yes that it was a battle against science and spirituality, but I think this was not explored well enough in the movie. I think too many things just started and were so brief. I loved the passion the protagonist had about making an artificial eye for example, but halfway through the movie we basically lose this. The worm gets an eye, he is on the television... cool! But what then? Then he is searching for this woman lowkey believing her soul may be in the child. And I'm all sitting there going like bullcrap! I mean come on, it's obvious that yeah he was gonna find the child and be all spiritual and stuff, but please... like too obvious. But I did like how he found out because she was afraid of elevators.I really did not believe the character of Sophie.

81,grahamvandyke,In one word: Beautiful,8,16 April 2018,"I will be the first person to admit I am not a huge fan of Art House movies. This movie is definitely shot like one, with cameras going in and out of focus occasionally and some obscure character interactions that tend not to happen in real life. But then again, I have lived a strange life and the kinds of interactions that I have had are similar to this. I Origins teases that line of Art House and Hollywood by being pulled back by the scientific precision that our protagonist exemplifies in the movie. He is a bit of an eccentric man driven by cold, hard facts and it is the way he approaches life in this way, especially with relationships, that creates drama and emotion. When the line between science and the spiritual becomes blurred with him is where I believe a lot of people have been.I Origins does not create any conclusion between these two dilemma-induced ways of thinking, rather letting the audience draw their own. All I can say is by the end of the movie I was in tears. It is simply beautiful.This movie is not for everyone; but for those it does touch, it will touch you in a big way.

85,jormatuominen,It is hard to create art out of nonsense,4,14 April 2017,"If this film inspires someone to even check the Wikipedia articles on reincarnation and on the evolution of the eye, then it has that much merit. I loved Cahill's Another Earth for it's poetic absurdity. To appreciate it's story of love, loss and loneliness one just had to pretend to accept for the duration the silly notion of a copy of our planet existing just a little way off out there. I Origins has pretty much the same agenda of love and loss and the human desire to overcome death somehow. I expected him to elaborate these themes. This time Cahill unfortunately loses it on page one of his own script. A premise of the film is that the human eye is the crown of creation or the finest product of evolution and somehow the home of the eternal human soul. This is a lot of weight on a very mediocre, merely adequate sensory organ. Should some God have designed the perfect eye, the bad news is that He/She gave it to a marine crustacean, the mantis shrimp. We got the budget model that was not good enough for the peregrine falcon nor the dragonfly. If Cahill had ever watched Animal Planet, he would have already known this and rewritten his obsessive script. Ridley Scott is an example of a director who can get off unpunished for some bad, really bad science in his films, after all they are works of fiction. But Cahill does not let the story flow as he did in Another Earth, he just keeps repeating the same silly notions. When we get to the reincarnation-like or rebirth-hinting part of the story, it turns out that Cahill does not understand this concept very well either. The obtrusive music and the very slow pace of the film did not help. I did like the ending a lot. Perhaps one day a rewrite will be made and the ending will get a worthy film preceding it.",I Origins

There is something artificial and unemotional in the narrative that runs throughout the movie.It is an admirable effort, and the story did keep me interested until the very end, but I highly doubt I would watch it again.While it looks nice, with a nice score and nice ideas, that is where it is stuck. In the ""nice"" territory. I honestly believe ""I Origins"" had more potential but is only an empty shell of what could have been. It occasionally reminded me of other low budget films that actually touched me, such as the brilliant ""Primer"" or the somewhat interesting ""Coherence"", with a touch of Terrence Mallick.The performances are certainly not bad but the narrative never seems to elevate itself to its full potential, making this a one-time viewing for me.It's not bad, not to be avoided, but nothing special neither.",I Origins

The acting is OK, the pacing is okayish, the shaky cam annoyed me at times, but the general visual style of the movie is pretty slick, and the dialogue - apart from the times they try to sound like scientists - is definitely above average.4/10 - good conversation starter, since it tackles interesting topics, but ultimately a mediocre movie that tries too hard to come across as clever.",I Origins

91,emilyelizabeth1283,I Origins,7,3 August 2014,"For me this movie, written and directed by Mike Cahill, was all about actor Michael Pitt. The premise of the story and the characters were fascinating, but I feel like the dialogue and explication for the science driving partners Ian (Pitt) and Karen, played by Brit Marling, could have gone more in depth. There are some interesting recurring shots, like the arc shots which follow Ian's gaze as he discovers the eyes that will impact his life so profoundly. In the first shot, the eyes are reflected in the windows of the bus Ian has just gotten off of. Upon seeing the reflection the arc follows his turn-around to arrive at the giant billboard advertising a French perfume under the eyes. And the second, which mimics the first, I won't tell you about because it would give away too much.The movie centers around Ian, a scientist, who meets a mysterious woman at a party. Their connection is made not so much with words, but with looks, gestures. Ian studies eyes and seeks to find a scientific explanation for the complexity of the eye, that which many defend as proof of a spiritual world, or higher power. He asks the woman if he can take a picture of her eyes. He is captivated by them, and they stick in his mind long after she has gone.One of the most beautiful scenes in the movie is the re-connection of these two at random. There are no words involved. She moves. He moves. They communicate in a unique way that seems otherworldly, their relationship's strength is built upon this serendipitous magic that seems to flow between them. Their only issue stems from her strong belief in a spiritual world. He is a staunch scientist in the vein of facts and data. He believes only in ""proof."" ""Why are you trying so hard to disprove god?"" asks his lover, Sofi, played elegantly by Astrid Berges-Frisbey. He responds that the question is irrelevant, who has ever ""proved"" there is a god to be dis-proved? In a climactic scene between the two, he attacks this aspect of her specifically, accusing her of being a child, living in a dream world.Michael Pitt demonstrates a natural coolness, exudes it even, in every line and movement. Especially in the intimate scenes with Sofi, subtle facial expressions and hand gestures remind me a lot of James Spader, whose unique body language has never waned. Pitt has an interesting face anyway, but the way he is able to bring his character to life by a look and movement of an eyebrow is a rare thing that is always a wonderful discovery with an actor I'm just coming to be familiar with.I first watched Michael Pitt as Mason Verger in Hannibal. The body language caught my eye and he instantly became one of the most interesting characters in the show. His style contributed in a creepy, weird way that is very effective as the mad playboy Verger, but this style is also recognizable in the sly, boyish presentation of Ian. His embarrassed laugh and tone of voice fit his character, but also identify him as the unique and not-easily-forgotten performer whose style pervades any role.When Sofi is lost once more, Ian finds comfort in the friendship of like-minded lab partner Karen, and soon a discovery is made that will change their lives forever. Someone living halfway across the world apparently has the same iris pattern as Sofi, something that is supposed to be impossible. With encouragement from Karen, Ian flies to India to investigate this discovery. If the two women are connected somehow, it would mean opening the possibility of spiritual existence, of human connection that goes beyond the physical and mortal realm.The movie unfolds in a well-paced and interesting manner. I was so interested in premise and storyline throughout, but I did not feel the movie delivered fully on the profound observations presented. I wanted to know more about the scientists' motivation, why was he so stubborn in his ideas? What is Sofi's background and why is she spiritual? I wanted to see more of the goings-on in the lab. The jumps made towards the latter half of the movie seemed rushed and strained my ability to suspend disbelief.Ultimately the movie satisfied me in large part due to both Michael Pitt and Brit Marling's performances. It was the subtle, beautiful aspects of the shooting that made the movie something special. The shaky cam coupled with the performance by the young lovers Pitt and Berges-Frisbey gave the movie a level of realness that is hard to reach, especially at the pace at which the relationship evolves. The ending is appropriate and sweetly terse, augmented with a bit of Radiohead to round everything up, leaving ultimate resolutions with the viewer to ponder for a few seconds through an unhurried dissolve.",I Origins
92,MrMowji,Targeting your beliefs,2,25 September 2017,"I like the battle between religion and science, but in an unbiased way. This movie tries ""to bias"" (as the child's name) your beliefs. If you want something to be believed by people, use facts. I'm not sure what was the purpose of writer, but here, we are watching a possible and not-yet-proved way that spirits exist. That's not good.It doesn't explain how a spirit can change before resurrection. As we see, Salomina's personality is different from Sofi's. How's that? If they share the same spirit in their bodies, how come that Salomina failed the test? On the other hand, the spirit should at least remember Ian's face.Just referencing to a kid that scares from an elevator isn't scientific.They concluded that two eyes can be exactly the same, so can the brains. I couldn't find a relation between these results and existence of the spirit. How does spirit shape the eyes or brains? Is there a one-to-one relationship between eyes/brains shape and spirits? I can accept that two brains may process in the same way. They perhaps need the exact same structure. It even makes more sense when we see that Tobias passes its three tests but Salommina which is older that Tobias (and perhaps some years of living, geographical difference and her lifestyle has changed it's personality and the way he thinks or perefer things) fails.So many questions are not answered.

And the easter egg at the end gave me goosebumps.Have to say though the test wasn't perfectly designed as the test result could potentially be tainted by cash incentives.He shouldn't say ""right""/""wrong"" for the girl's answers as we can see she got a bit worried getting the wrong answers half way through the test (or it could be the camera work, what am I talking about .. this is not a documentary, but still).He shouldn't have taken the girl to an expensive hotel room and fed the girl her favorite food before the test because if the girl has been living in a poor condition she would probably do anything to please just so she could get this luxury treatment again.Same thing could be said for the defining moment - the elevator and crying scene, which could be still understood as the fact that she doesn't want to go back to that poor life again.But anyways, as a movie it is powerful enough to spark the curiosity, drag me along and Make me write this review after watching.

Personally, I enjoyed pretty much everything about it. The characters felt very real to me, enough to make me teary a couple of times. The nature of lab work was also realistically portrayed, capturing the willingness of researchers to put months of work into often fruitless explorations. My only (minor) complaint is that Sophie could have used more character development, because she comes across as a bit of a one-trick pony. Maybe the writer thought making her mysterious would help sell the whole soulmate angle. However, giving the couple something more than just sex in common would have served much better. Then again, maybe that's the point - is it destiny or just hormones?i think the ending is open to some interpretation. I thought it depicted the lead character's journey into greater open mindedness, whereas my friend chose to see it as more of a spiritual awakening. It's one of those things you have to decide for yourself I guess.",I Origins

The characters felt real, wasn't forced. Would watch again. Raised a Catholic, I'm surrounded by people of this faith but I grew up enjoying science as well and found it very difficult to believe in both at the same time. Science won me over and now I'm an agnostic. Sometimes I'm full atheist, but this movie just settled it for me. With current science, I cannot completely prove or disprove the existence of a higher being, an afterlife, or reincarnation. I do not believe in any one religion. I have my own and it incorporates all the good aspects of several religions. I Origins does not fight strongly for religion or for science. It just gets you thinking.

Unfortunately this feeling didn't hold up too far. The dialogues and concepts are good but the movie is filled with a lot of weird coincidences that are supposed to be meaningful but just feel artificial. Romance plays a huge part in this story and because of it the movie drags a lot.The movie is slow paced from beginning to end and most of the romance scenes feel like filler. The movie becomes increasingly slow to the point I was begging for it to end.Overall, it would be a much more enjoyable if shortened to, let's say, 45 minutes max. But if you don't mind romance-filled-long-slow movies, the concepts within this one may be worth your time.",I Origins
106,lexxtoronto,A thought provoking movie but somewhat inaccurate,8,4 May 2016,"It's a nice, thought provoking and sad movie. I know this is just a movie and many things are done for cinematographic, artistic purposes but if anyone is interested in inaccuracies in this movie, here they are.(1) In her subsequent reincarnation she won't be afraid of elevators because of how she died, she died very quickly so she didn't have time to realize what happened. If a person nearly drowned they will remember this experience and the fear of water MIGHT be carried into the next re-birth.(2) Reincarnated people can be very different biologically, it's a totally new physical body with different fingerprints and eye patterns, they don't bring in any physical features from previous lives.(3) Souls are not reborn immediately after death except probably for newborns, some children and some rare cases in adults. Usually for adults it may take anywhere from tens to hundreds of years to get reborn. A person sheds their physical body when it's damaged or worn out, after that soul's new body is an emotional body made out of our emotions, experiences. After that it's a turn for a mental body. When the mental body wears out a soul will be reborn. So it takes time.And here are accurate pieces of information (1) Yes all souls will be eventually reborn except for those who achieve full enlightenment - they can also be reborn if they choose to but regular souls don't have a choice, they are forced to. There are various degrees of enlightenment unless you are fully enlightened you will still be reborn.(2) Yes you can be born in another country, have a different gender or you can even be reborn into another time. Time for reincarnation is not linear, if someone dies in 2016 it is very possible to be reborn in 1634 or 2342, it is unpredictable - the notion of time exists in our three dimensional physical world, the Universe is timeless.(3) Remember the scene with 11.11?

I made curious about to find the owner of those eyes. The thing is that I expect a little more beautiful women as the owner of those eyes, but she is much talented and passionate actress. I am pretty sure that the death of the women made every viewers frustrate. Because it was a quick and the women cut in two, also the casting at that stage definitely made the viewer into that terrific situation.

Lots of little visual clues on the sets which tried to set the scene which unfortunately was already being crow-barred in via the script.Random characters appear and allude to having a part to play but unfortunately nothing happens, just points to the director or scriptwriter running out of ideas.Don't get me wrong it's a decent movie and fairly interesting but there are so many holes in the science and the faith based arguments it's a bit over the top. Also the part where the protagonist just takes a small Indian girl off the streets in a taxi then into hotel into his bedroom, humm I think that's the only part of the whole film I had to question myself..I mean really? not one person said anything and the main chap thought this was a perfectly normal thing to do.....very strange.OK film worth a watch but anyone who says this is a fantastic film really needs to watch more films.

Some said it was scientifically based and others said it was based on pseudoscience. In the mist of such an enigma, I just had to watch this movie - figuring that I could always stop watching if it was just too bad.Fact is that the movie was excellent. It had everything that many bad movies lack, such as a good, captivating, and entertaining story; good writing, good cinematography, and good acting. Truth be told, it should rate about seven or eight stars, but I chose to give it ten to negate the obviously biased negative reviews. I can only conclude that the negative reviewers have an agenda or a belief system that the premise of this movie contradicts. As a scientist, I can say that the science presented is fundamentally sound, and as a believer in God I can say that the spiritualism is sound as well.

If something actually happens later on in the film it happens too late.the characters are too dull to care about and the story is nonexistent. Michael Pitt usually picks better films. This is a case of a film trying to be artistic without any compelling story or character elements.

118,The_Cake_of_Roth,Interesting idea... execution lacking,6,20 March 2015,"I've thought about this film quite bit after watching it, so there's certainly something fundamentally compelling about it conceptually, but the execution was lacking for me. The movie feels like an ending with a movie attached in front of it. It's like Cahill started with this idea and struggled to flesh it out into a feature film, so everything that happens before the final half hour or so feels dramatically inert and overly distended. It almost feels like a movie that was written in reverse.I like the sense of unpredictability that the film has... you don't know where it's going, but it takes too long for the film's conceptual backbone to emerge. The film raises these questions about spirituality vs. science... but doesn't really have anything particularly interesting say. It ends up being kind of hokey, with some occasionally atrocious dialogue: ""Maybe the eye is a window into the soul,"" ""My atoms have always loved your atoms.""",I Origins
119,jds10011,Wanted - expected - better,6,4 October 2015,"I like what Brit Marling and Cahill try to do, and that they are making their films. This one could have used a more mature touch - perhaps an adviser to help them avoid a level of pretentiousness that pervades the entire movie.One way this is on display is the movement of the camera and/or some of the camera angles. More of a problem is the too-frequent setting of a dark room or night or some place that is dark, for no reason that adds to the story other than the unnecessary and obvious 'young filmmaker making a moody film' statement. My opinion of the story arc and some of the writing is that it is not nearly so profound as the writer obviously hoped it to be (or as some other reviewers interpreted). It is simplistic and shallow, actually, and pretends toward profundity, with very little substance underlying the heavy layers of melodrama.Ms. Marling is better than this material - she struggles to make her lines meaningful and real, and to avoid the pretentiousness that is written into some of them. Mr. Pitt displays a range that rivals peeling wallpaper. His modeling background shows through here, with his persistent one blank look. He did have different glasses, at least once, though.

What you need is a really original story, lots of creativity, good direction and honest performances of good actors. Being myself a molecular biologist, I really liked that the laboratory was very realistic; without the tons of unnecessary or unrelated equipment that are usually shown in movies, just because they look pretty with lots of blinking color lights. It helps me accept the fantastic parts of the plot. To finish I want to say that it is true that there are several scientific holes in the plot, but this is a Fantasy movie not a National Geographic's documentary; so please, do not expect a premise like ""The eyes are the reflection of the soul"" to be scientifically substantiated at the end, as if it was a paper submitted to Science or PNAS.

Even the main characters are like the opposites: The science man vs. the spiritual woman.Besides, there are a lot of symbolical meanings of the objects to explain the ""holy"" meaning of things. For instance, opening the door at the end of the film represents opening yourself to the other side of the world just like Sofi said in the bedroom scene.And also the obvious elevator scene which represents the main connection between the indian girl and Sofi can be explained in this way too.These scenes are very impressive of course, however in general, the whole plot changes when Sofi dies in the middle of the movie. That's why the first part of the film feels like a romantic movie but the second part is a scientific adventure movie which is absolutely weird.I wish that the storytelling of the movie was based on a more strict and direct narrative.

The characters and settings are great in it, the love story was surprising (especially when they had sex in the first 10 minutes of the movie!), then it changes completely from a love story. The movie isn't very predictable in most places, which is a definite plus. My biggest problems with the movie are: 1) the over-done science vs. religion theme, I've heard it all, I don't care anymore. It just feeds the stereotype that all scientists are out to get your religion and disprove God. 2) not enough time spent developing Sofi. This may actually be a good thing for the story, but I felt like a HAD to know more about this girl that was so important, and maybe that is why it is done correctly. 3) the non-ending of the film. Vague, abrupt endings can work for some movies, but for this one, just left a kinda eh feeling. What happens to the little girl? She was homeless! Did he just leave her and go back home? Leave her at the shelter/found another home? Adopt her? The thing with the 11's was very interesting, but never touched upon again. I thought this was how he was going to find the little girl but I was wrong. Not explaining why the 11-thing worked was a great move that kept the movie going (so many movies get bogged down in explaining things I don't care about, if I wanted a movie about explaining things I would watch a documentary). How the lab tech was introduced was brilliantly done.

127,philippsiam,Moving eye opener - mine were wet,10,19 July 2014,"The biggest flaw in I Origins is its predictability. Perhaps this is due to the trailer leaving very little of the plot development to the imagination. Yet, having said that, I still found myself moved even to tears by several scenes in this emotional roller-coaster of a film. I'm admittedly a junkie for supernatural themed films (Ghost is a favorite of mine) and this film's attack on a sort of mentality that holds that science must equal atheism in its strictest form won me over after some hesitation. I think the numerous bad reviews of this film by mainstream critics come from those who hold some version of this aforementioned mentality, and took offense at the premise of this film, but for anyone either truly open minded, or else already convinced that there is more to life than meets the eye (pun intended), this film is a true joy, albeit a joy born of great suffering.A scientist who spends his life trying to disprove God and intelligent design (I'm all for science and learning, and am NOT religious at all, but what satisfaction anyone could achieve by trying to deny the existence of omnipresent Love and Knowledge is beyond me - but I digress) meets a woman who seems to exist within a deeper realm of direct being - i.e. she seems to live with a connection to Love and Knowledge that the scientist only strives for. They fall in love. Things happen and their relationship is no more. Life goes on and strange things happen. Many people took great umbrage with the remaining development of the film, considering the concept too wild or far fetched, when in actuality it is a natural concept that (at least in a symbolic sense) would be more surprising if it were not true than if it was. For feel good entertainment value I give this film ten stars. Is it actually a perfect film? No. No film is perfect. But those who will not love this film would not love it under any revisions because it is not a film for such people.

The main lead is Ian Gray played beautifully and flawlessly by Micheal Pitt. Ian Gray is studying the evolution of human eyes with his Lab Partner( played beautifully by Brit Marling). He fell in love with Sofi who has a very beautiful pair of eyes. But as the movie progresses we can find that there are dissimilarities between Sofi and Ian. Sofi believes in God but Ian doesn't.The real interest begins after 1 hour. Every person has a unique iris pattern but as you watch the movie you will get to know that the fact is wrong.My favorite part is when Ian and Priya have a conversation about Dala lama's answer to the question ""What would you do if something scientific disproved your religious beliefs?"". And he said, after much thought, ""I would look at all the papers. I'd take a look at all the research and really try to understand things. And in the end, if it was clear that the scientific evidence disproved my spiritual beliefs, I would change my beliefs."" . What a mindblowing answer.I am not telling much more about the movie because I don't want to ruin it for anyone. I am recommending everyone to watch I Origins.

Also it features one of my favorite songs by Radiohead, one of my favorite bands. I will say, I can see some of the criticism regarding some scenes. An example being the death scene was over the top even if it was relevant to the end of the movie. I thought it was a bit of a cheap way to setup a narrative. The acting was top notch, Stephen Yeun of Walking Dead fame gave a very good understated performance as the best friend. Basically the film asks you to consider science vs spirituality, but if you try to read more into it than this basic question then it will fail. While evolution, creation, various religious teachings etc. are all part of the conversation, the movie isn't asking those questions. It simply narrates one man's story of what he believes and how his experiences change those beliefs. I believe many critics incorrectly thought it was asking deeper questions ,and therefore, reviewed negatively. If you already believe strongly in one side or the other, than this movie will probably not make an impact on you, and again I don't think it was meant to.",I Origins

I don't know if they have ever lost someone young, but they manage to express these feelings in a very accurate way. Also in ''Another Earth'', they give what could be psychological solutions for people who remain damaged for the rest of their lives after a loss. When I watched ''Another Earth'' I had only suffered loss of relationships and I still found myself. Only a meeting with yourself can save you. It is not as easy to apply when someone dies... In ''I Origins'' it really gives the only solution that could make life bearable after losing someone young... knowing for sure that their conscience goes on and continues living, more than any survival of the spirit or other notions we use to explain the passing of someone dear, knowing that they go on to live on Earth....",I Origins

144,elizdere,"Soulful blend of science, religion, and romance",8,18 June 2016,"I Origins is ultimately a satisfying film. It delves into issues of science, religion, philosophy, and love in a very appealing way. The main character, Ian, played by Michael Pitt, is a young scientist studying the eye, at least partly to answer the evolution vs God question. He meets Sofi (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), a unique-eyed free spirit whom he immediately falls head over heels for, but also clashes with. The combination of their romance, advances in science, and some odd coincidences eventually causes him to explore his own beliefs. The film has some really beautiful moments and opens up some great discussions about how much one can really know about the universe. The actors all play their parts well and the film utilizes some lovely music. The one criticism would be that the movie feels like two separate stories - the first half and the second half - and while both are intriguing, writer- director Mike Cahill takes a while to connect the two. The first half feels more romantic and philosophical while the later section takes a left turn into science fiction with an almost thriller tone. The ending manages to bring it all together in a cathartic way, though the scene after the credits throws the paranoid sci-fi feeling back in the mix, as if Cahill, unlike his protagonist, still cannot reconcile his romanticism with his scientific cynicism. Still, if you liked his previous film, Another Earth (also starring Brit Marling), you likely enjoy this one.",I Origins

I do not normally rate or review movies with this only the second one ever.That being said; This movie is fantastic. From start to finish. There is no action, no stunning visual effects or car chases. This movie is not a huge blockbuster, nor is it conventional Hollywood crap I am so accustomed to watching. This is everything I normally avoid in a movie. That being said, I am so happy I watched this and I do not think I will ever forget it. In short, this fill moved me. I teared up. This film made me think. it is still making me think. If I had to categorize it I would say it is spiritual and thought provoking. I will watch this again, and maybe again and again.The cast is delightful and very normal. No fancy costumes or woman dressed to the nine covered in make-up. It is a spiritual film based on the backs of scientists who believe in data and facts and what they can prove, only to be lead to question facts with belief. Science and religion have always been on two different sides and the spectrum and this movie attempts to bridge that gap and does an amazing job at doing so. This story is as original a plot line as you can get nowadays. As I said this movie has touched me and in a very small way I am changed forever now that I have seen it.

It is one of the most surprising pieces of screen writing I've seen in a long time. Not in the sense of there being dramatic revelations and aha- moments, but rather the twists and turns that keep happening throughout that transform the entire story, its premise, and in some sense even its genre several times.I'm sure it's not for everyone, and that said script dynamics to some are only confusing, but I'm just happy that what I expected to be yet another small-setting science fiction story continuously kept surprising. Thanks to great casting, cinematography and music, this was all in all a very enjoyable experience and I think anyone even remotely into science fiction should see it.Some themes of science vs. religion, logic vs. intuition, etc. can be a bit tiresome in this as well as in any movie, but I still think I Origins plays in the clever league with movies such as Primer and Coherence rather than your average mainstream.",I Origins

154,sdoell,Good but with problems,7,2 January 2015,"To enjoy many good stories, you have to suspend disbelief. I enjoyed I Origins but would like to address some problems in execution rather than in the overall theme.The overall suspense of finding the answer to the question of life and reincarnation overwhelmingly understated the agnostic, anti-theist, or atheist cases. This can be forgiven given that romance is much harder to portray with dead-sober rationals like these.The filmmaker wisely chose to end the story with affirmation of the main character's existential beliefs without hard proof. This is essential to films like these. If they completely resolved the philosophical dilemma, the film would have been panned.The most glaring error lies with the testing method he used on the young Indian girl with the same eyes as his ex-girlfriend. It was utterly unscientific from the start. Others have pointed out small errors in the plot and science of the film but this one is almost unforgivable. When he asks her to choose one out of three pictures, he relays if it is correct or incorrect to his wife which is obvious psychological manipulation of the girl. This would invalidate the test results. At the end, the girl even asks if she did poorly on the test clearly revealing the case. I can accept the better than 33% test results but the error in testing methodology left a sour taste in my mouth.In hindsight, I realize it was done to allow quick analysis of the results thereby moving the story forward without extra scenes or dialogue. I have yet to determine whether or not it is acceptable. I will let it go. It's a movie, not a scientific treatise. I Origins is worth a watch.",I Origins

160,annie_honeys,About Sofi,10,25 July 2015,"The film casts an enchanting spell that hovers over the mind of the viewers for days, a sentiment that what a mysterious wonderful soulful creature Sofi was, a beloved spirit who we lost and who might (or might not) find her again. The last time I was carried away by such a strong sentiment is when finished reading Emily Bronte's wuthering heights, but for a film to sketch a character as equally soulful and enchanting as Catherine earnshaw is in itself remarkable achievement. And Sofi doesn't even speak as much. The most powerful scene of the film is when sofi and Karen meet for the first time. We along with Ian sense through sofi's reaction that there's sth wrong. For the first time in film history, we get a sense that one of the character in the film, the girl that claims herself enlightened by a higher sense (despite we were never told sofi is religious), knew what will happen to her, and Karen will be the one to replace her. It suddenly becomes obvious that sofi alone is aware of the film's plot and it is in that moment from watching her knowing it, we audience get the clue, that sth romantic might happen between Karen and Ian, though clearly at that stage it hasn't yet started to take shape. Sofi, thus, becomes herself an artist, having access to a knowledge exclusive to the creator of the film: in that sense, she is special, and enlightened. But none of this was made explicitly through the camera, we only knew it in retrospection when the film ended. She is the seer, and we sees after her. In that scene in the lab, Sofi regards Karen with a sense of bitterness and sadness, an ambiguous hostility but not so strong as jealousy or hate. It is out of a knowing that what will happen happens and that her end is coming and their story will begin. It is almost like a passive acceptance, a guarded tolerance.We audience have no sense of any chemistry going on between Ian and Karen until that moment, because we are all too taken away by the romance between sofi and Ian to notice anyone else. We know it all through sofi's eyes. It took us by surprise. The film is amazing in that it conceals sofi's phantasmagoria in a tantalizing romantic make-belief. Like Ian, we smile when she said it was she sent out the signs for Ian to find her because we take her words romantically, not for real; Like Ian, we take her insistence on marrying him on that particular day of her death as her usually childish behavior; Like Ian, we joke about her serious talk about her wish of being cremated after death; Also, like Ian, we know so much about her as well as little about her, -- she never talks about her parents and origin, she was like a passenger, just passing by this world. Like Ian, we are fascinated by her broad spiritual vision whereas remains secretly doubtful about it as well - - she could be just another naive child talking wild for all we know, and Ian indeed believed so after married with the same scientific mind of Karen. Like Ian, we struggled not to open that door that let to another world, and sofi is that string of light sifting through. However, in the end, the radiant of her spirit just bursting through, doors opened. The film ended with Ian holding the child that has sofi's eyes walks through the door to a radiating pool of lightness. Here, again, the director cleverly withholds the answer yet reveals it by its concealing: The little girl keep making wrong matches to sofi's preferences, but could it because she's conscious of Ian's upset of her making mistakes jeopardize her instinct? the little girl shouts sth we don't understand when the elevator comes which clearly Ian takes as a sign of her connection to the cause of sofi's death, but could it simply because she is afraid of Ian's about to let her go? possible. But Ian must be aware of all those too. After all, it is not because the fear little girl gave out when the elevator came, it is because Ian directly looked into those eyes of sofi that convert him into this belief: it is her after all. It is a feeling, no need of proof. and the film almost gave us a no show, but invite us to feel Ian must have felt in that instant through that long shot of mutual eye contact. We realize, maybe not right at that moment but later when the film is over, that sofi is right all along, and that we finally make sense of her, understand her with such fierce a clarity, and came the overwhelming feeling that we once had her around, had her misunderstood and lost her . It must be a thousand times worse a revelation for Ian. The girl may or may not be her is no longer the matter in the end. The director has already made Ian and the audience a believer by the film's end. The eyes of sofi (originally means for wisdom)seal on our soul forever. and What a beautiful pair of eyes! The most remarkable thing is the soul of the film, sofi, dies at not even close to one third of the film and the director just carry on the rest of the film as a revelation in her awake. And by the end, we are indeed conversed.",I Origins

The sad thing about this movie is that it already won the Alfred P. Sloan prize based on it's ""scientific"" merit....don't get me started on that, the science in this movie is nothing more than loosely woven pseudoscience. In the paraphrased words of my cousin, ""It seems like it was an article written in the early 1900s about the concept of 'the eyes are the mirror to the soul' for some pulp magazine by someone who wanted to write a scientific story about it but didn't have enough scientific knowledge to do it,but did it anyway, and then someone found this story and decided to make a movie about it with pretentious and really shaky cinematography."" Not to mention that in this movie, a white rich guy is able to go to India and pluck a little girl off the streets and take her to a hotel to question her without that being addressed at all in the film as being incredibly problematic. Or how they sexualized the main female in a stereotypical ""wise because she has an accent and attractive because she's not from here"" way, giving her no real depth or wants or motivations beyond the main male role and her efforts to convince him in some spiritual belief of hers. To top that off, the beginning of the movie involves the lead literally stalking this woman and it's shown to be okay because apparently she was just playing hard to get and wanted him to stalk her.There was also this weird subplot where there was some religious leader at the hotel he goes to, the same hotel where he takes the abducted Indian girl and questions her, and for a minute I was thinking the storyline of the movie was going to turn around and that the main character would be arrested for child abduction. But nope, the whole appearance of this character had absolutely no relevance to the story and was a total waste of time.And worse, 150 people were wait-listed for this movie.

I also struggled with the big holes in the research, with much more that my scientist half wanted to explore in this idea, such as finding 3, 4, 5 or even 20 more subjects whose eye patterns matched. Or taking Tobias to Boise Idaho and seeing what else, if anything, he connected with.And as someone who is a spiritualist by choice, the exploration of the unknown, including reincarnation and past lives was at best fleeting, and very unsatisfying. What might the implications of this research be for our understanding of the world, how might these experiences translate to a new life or what else might be transferred? Or maybe even just, what's it like to have this connection? What is the experience of this like?

168,stephentheh,"Good story idea, very poor character development/execution",5,16 July 2014,"I wanted to like this movie, after enjoying the director's previous film ""Another Earth,"" but this one just seemed half-baked.Major character flaws with the main character Ian who repeatedly states he only believes in the scientific process and in data, suddenly acting according to superstitious numerology following the number 11 to try and track down this girl he slept with once and now is actively stalking. Long story short, his stalking is not confronted by either his subject nor the people at his workplace who see it plainly, and the numerology aspect is dropped as soon as it's brought up.Moving on, the women characters in the film are pretty one-dimensional, with Ian's first ""wife""/stalking subject Sofi being a stereotypical foreign whimsical sex goddess who entreats him to believe in the supernatural because love or whatever, but her beliefs aren't ever explored or defined in the slightest, and he still goes through with ""marrying"" her even though they don't really see eye to eye at all. Pun intended.The marriage, by the way, is ridiculous. They're both adults and show up at a city office to get married completely oblivious to how marriage works. So whimsical, so romantic! They then exchange rings anyway and proclaim themselves married. So whimsical, so romantic! Skipping a bad scene at the lab, his new ""wife"" dies the same day in an elevator accident. So whimsical, so disposable! His second wife and lab assistant Karen seems to latch onto Ian as soon as Sofi dies, because clearly this stalker is marriage material (she even caught him creeping on Sofi earlier in the film, but rather than be repulsed by it oh whatever). Years later, his science book comes out based on what seems in the film to be mostly her work done while he was out stalking, but whatever, he becomes famous and she becomes pregnant because that's what she's there for I guess.Oh, and forget about the Bechdel Test, I'm pretty sure this film fails that.Moving on, the film's climax is when Karen, the scientific type, entreats him to go to India to track down/stalk this girl who might be the reincarnation of his first wife because they share the same eyes. Because that's what a rationally/scientifically minded wife would do. This after some other doctor runs a test on their son for autism but really she wasn't testing for autism but for reincarnation, because that's what doctors do in real life. Guess what though, this doctor is also promptly discarded in the plot even though you'd think maybe duder would have wanted to follow up with her on their shared hypothesis-slash-lunacy.Weeks after Ian arrives in India, he finally finds the 7-year-old girl, brings her back to his hotel room unchallenged (because that's what you do with your plot when you're a lazy writer) and runs a test to see if she remembers her previous life as his ""wife."" Are you rolling your eyes yet?Well, surprise, she fails the test, and he feels foolish. Then they go to take the elevator back downstairs again and the girl breaks down crying and they hug and apparently that disproves science so The End! It's the feel-good disaster of the summer.I actually liked the idea of science and religion being put to the test, but the execution of this film, its poor character development, and people doing what no real person would do make this just sort of fall apart. There's still some very nice feel-good moments that are pulled off successfully, but there's so much bad to overlook it's not really worth it.",I Origins

There are two main reasons : First , the director managed to mix a scientific topic with a romantic story that ends up giving the film a more powerful meaning . The second reason responds to people like me who do not want to see the standard romantic movie with a classic happy ending. The film begins with a love that is not so credible , it seems to be perfect, but as the film progresses, we see that its beautifully imperfect and that's all the main theme of the movie for me , that finding perfection should not be the focus of research, but it must be the pursuit of evolution that led us to what we are today.The only problem I have seen in the film was not connected properly and left unfinished some of the short stories in the main plot(the scene of the number eleven).

The last straw for me occurred very early in the film when the main character bought a lottery ticket. Stupid people who watch stupid movies buy lottery tickets, but scientists don't. If you're over twelve and made it through high school, don't waste your time on this pathetic attempt at profundity. It's not even bad enough to be laughable, which means at least for me, it had zero entertainment value. The fact that this movie is getting decent reviews just reinforces my belief that the US just keeps getting dumber. I don't know who the target audience is, but even my fifteen year old daughter knew the ""science"" had all the authenticity of a superhero movie.

Loved the concept and the cast, movie could be slightly edited to move faster but what a trip! It presents itself as an intelligent broad appeal release, not the typical indie-low budget-gritty product of Sundance. I like more mainstream movies, and loved this movie so my guess is that will resonate with a very large audience when released. The love story is so convincing that casts a haunting spell in the rest of the movie, and the scientific discovery (don't want to spoil the story) is so cool and full of heart that if true in real life would completely change the way we look at life and relationships. Kudos to Fox Searchlight, they seem to be on a roll with award winning titles and out of the box, but mainstream appealing movies.",I Origins

However I decided to give it a shot with the hopes of perhaps at the very least being entertained.From where the movie starts it ends in quite a different place than expected. The character development is superb and the narrative exquisite.A good movie is characterized by many different metrics.

179,rapaul-208-984415,"Excellent, thought provoking, with a harsh twist",8,9 January 2015,"I am a hard-core materialist scientist (physicist) yet am open to evidence that could threaten my world-view--as any good scientist should be. I am therefore not quite as arrogant about my view as the protagonist in this movie, a molecular biologist who is both atheist and rejecting of any kind of understanding of an imagined spirit world or possibility of reincarnation. Yet, his scientific openness and his injured heart get the better of him.Having just attended a week-long seminar discussing (with scepticism) and contemplating the existence of gods, spirits and the afterlife, I was primed for this movie--it was amazingly apropos. It is well acted, well developed, any predictability does not detract from enjoyment. Other than the one harsh twist, I would recommend it without reservation. See the Parental Guide and my comment below.The movie is in two parts: First, our scientist hero is with his passionate lover where heart and head are in conflict, since she is a believer and he is not. Her explanations and attempts to get him to open to possibilities are cogent and thought provoking. Then the harsh twist. Slight Spoiler Alert--but necessary to avoid too much pain: The ParentalGuide says: A person is cut in half due to faulty machinery. When our hero and his lover are stuck in an elevator, with a small opening out of which they could crawl, we are now prepared for the worst. Yet, there is enough suspense about it that when they finally come out of the elevator, we think it is okay. But it is not. I advise that once they get into the elevator an even slightly queasy viewer (like me) simply skip over. It is too much to take.More slight spoiling, but not much: Then the second half of the movie takes up with his heart and head together: he is (predictably) with his lab partner wife as years pass. Now they are led into a discovery of reincarnation. However, they are both scientists, hence the discovery is evidence-based, not mere speculative philosophy or religion. The first half was good, and this half is great--although a scientist is writing. Highly recommended for anyone open but sceptical. Stay open, stay sceptical.",I Origins

He discovered a few bugs here and there, but he also found nice references. Anyways, this is my opinion. I really loved the aesthetic filming and the suitable setting. The ways the mood of the movie changed after ""plot points"" were interesting to watch. The love scenes were also dazzling and delicate. Each of them was unique, and real at the same time. The contrast between Ian and Sofi's ""beliefs"" was very intriguing. There were some nice punchlines and metaphors, but at the same time, some of them were rather vague and/or cliché. (I'm not gonna complain because this whole issue is pretty vague!) Overall, I dig the dialogues! You could easily identify the character archetypes. But at the same time, the way each incident, discovery, and phenomenon helped each person's development was tangible and amusing. Sofi's death for example. And the way it impacted Ian's life. It was a huge turning point. The ""lab day"" was the day that Ian ""won"" and ""lost"". In my opinion, the finest aspect about this movie was the state of turmoil and bewilderment. It was thoroughly implemented in the film. So many people disliked the movie because of the controversial closure. I believe that you shouldn't watch this movie looking for an ""epic plot twist"" or for your ""beliefs"" to be approved. The point about this movie is not the ending or the ""conclusion"". There will never be an answer. That's why I was low-key disappointed with how spirituality hit the final strike. But honestly, I couldn't really think of a better ending, since ""religion and spirituality"" wasn't even utterly approved. I believe that this film was about the thought-process of the characters and their pragmatic and tangible feelings, thoughts, and reactions.

It's kind of hard to describe it, because you just have to feel it by yourself.
It's a very sensitive, emotional, deep and the original one.
If you believe in coincidences and sometimes you are confused/surprised by the things, which happens to you every day and those coincidences started to have a meaning for you, you should believe in your intuition. Because it really has a meaning and something, which can't be explained. I think, that there are some things, which you can't really explain with science. Maybe it's a sign of the dreamer, but still. We are all some kind of dreamers in our minds. And it depends on us, if we want to believe on it or we will just try to explain it with science.
I guess, that many of people has something strange in their life, when they were just confused by their own mind. Have you ever met a person for the first time and felt somehow strange, that you know this person for a very long time? Or maybe you have 'your' number, which leads you every day no matter what? What about other coincidences, when you are just standing and trying to understand what just happened? Everything has a meaning.

193,krisvasileva-43841,Offensive to my intelligence,2,24 October 2020,"I'll try to be brief here. This hipster movie was so offensive and distasteful that I had to create an account and rate it.
1. How very gross and stupid is to make that death scene. It is painted in my memory and I cannot possibly find any meaning in it. Except for cheap trills.
2. Brit Marling's character finds her husband sniffing some french perfume secretly while touching himself thinking of his dead gf, and she's OK with it.
3. The movie starts with 1st person narration and then it forgets about it.
4. The notion of spirituality is just words and nothing else. What do the characters mean by spirit world? Those studios and crews seem to lack basic minimal knowledge of those concepts.not a single spiritual writer or idea was mentioned.
5. The baby scene was creepy. What happened with that research? What's with the dead guy's family? Ian finds them then nothing. Why did they put those scenes at all?
6. Creepy creepy main character takes the girl to his room and nothing seems to be wrong with that.
7. And finally , my main problem with that nonsense movie is the French girl, who is the ultimate stock character. She is lacking any features and depth. She is some sort of wild manic pixie dream girl that speaks random new age crap. And the guy is falling for that? No, no, let's be honest here she's just sexually open dressed with miniskirts and knee high sock. She's french ,no parents, no education, no boundaries. She's having her time. Until she doesn't.

195,kellaurm,Iris this could have been different..,6,17 December 2020,"This movie has some interesting guts, but it is missing the bones needed for the plot and character development to really carry out the message of the film. The ideas are not new, and some of them are illogical, but I love the notion of science being put into question; not in favour of a higher power, but merely for improving upon itself. Still as Carl Sagan put it:
""Humans may crave absolute certainty; they may aspire to it; they may pretend ... to have attained it. But the history of science-by far the most successful claim to knowledge accessible to humans-teaches that the most we can hope for is successive improvement in our understanding, learning from our mistakes, an asymptotic approach to the Universe, but with the proviso that absolute certainty will always elude us.""
Therefore, it's kind of maddening that the only reliable response to uncertainty is to keep seeking more uncertainty, and to not even for a second entertain the idea that faith is merely the belief in that which is uncertain.
I liked that Sofi questions Ian's innate fear in moving beyond his own belief system. Her character while a little shallow, does pose him some probing questions. Why is he so intent on disproving that there might be a God? Why are atheists or people grounded in science so intent on creating a world in which everything is certain and within the limits of whatever parameters we set up? Isn't there beauty in the whole, without the reduction of everything into its parts. Is a snowflake as mesmerizing if we reduce to to mere frozen falling ice?
We've all become so riddled by what we don't know, placed in to two groups: People who consider something greater at play, or people who spend their lives trying to reduce it all into neat and tidy scientific explanations. Could it be that we aren't so divided after all, that the centre of the Venn is simply a lack of knowing and the unsettling nature it instills in all of us.The movie explores beautiful ideas and ideals. Reincarnation and soul mates, love and grief. I say beautiful, because although other reviewers had problems with Ian abandoning his scientific ideals for numerology at the very sight of an attractive female, I found that this further cemented the cognitive dissonance that comes with strong beliefs on either side. He is suddenly moved by the all encompassing force that is love, yet still surprised by his curiosity in someone who sees the world completely differently and with such wonder.I really disliked the vapid character development and the unrealistic plot developments. I feel that marrying Karen was a way to bury his grief, and I feel that his relationship with Sofi was never fully developed. Instead they could have developed both relationships alongside one another to showcase the dichotomy between science and spirit. There were some heart wrenching moments and I was moved by some of the possible answers to the questions posed.I do enjoy the idea interconnectedness and this theme did get woven into the framework of the film overall, like when Ian says to Sofi ""When the big bang happened, all the atoms in the universe, they were all smashed together into one little dot that exploded outward. ... So my atoms have known your atoms and they've always known your atoms. My atoms have always loved your atoms.""He may not have seen her a life partner, but it did not change the fact that he did indeed love her, and that she forever left her mark on him.There aren't many films that really explore the spirit and soul in love, and what is love, if not some pheromones mixed with a little crazy blind faith?",I Origins

It's obvious that the script is written by someone who knows absolutely nothing about science and tries to hide it by being mysterious. It's not working. Why are you people reviewing this movie as being good? You are all morons and deserve your life being hidden by religious mist.Even if I would buy this movie's premise, I'd still have reservations. Why would Ian and Karen not speak to the scientist woman who tested their child? Why would they investigate what she showed them and not try to speak to her about what is going on? Which is just an example off the top of my head after seeing it. Don't waste your time. Unless you want some humor. Or if you're a moron. Then please watch it. It might change your life.

This is not a sci-fi flick, the sci- fi elements in it are next to noting, and the tag is so overkill it deserves the grade. This is a straight up drama, overly involved with itself. Life is hard, I get it. It is also diverse. The movie has a tough time remembering that. Not a drama fan here, but can watch if implemented with other genres (think Interstellar, American Beauty)..

How can this be a religious flick?Just enjoy the show my friend... no more religion, we're so sorry.1:15:00 in, and oie, one of the lead roles suddenly believes in religion for no explainable reason other than to drive the plot, which has now crumbled, ever forward, toward Sunday school.Your choice of a Cesar's things to Caesar Salad, or an unlimited amount of Breadsticks and Fish, oui misure?Now you're forced to choose something else entirely, as after this point, the religion is thrust down your throat nearly every scene, until at 1:26:00 we're faced with a religious debate between our scientist and some lady that logically pummels him using illogical reasoning, and clearly, somehow, the music tells us that she pwns him with something that is apparently supposed to make logical sense but keep in mind this is a work of fiction.It is apparent that this moment is ""the point"" of watching the movie, because from this second on, you can practically describe every next scene in complete detail.

Of course there is but its the simplicity of beauty just like life, you see through it and start to absorb it fully and cherish it, care and love it... that is if you truly love a good film!

Not the most famous ones, but beautiful and excellently selected for their roles. Script - I think its genius. At a first glance may seem just the best, but it is much deeper than that. All the issues raised and the way they were provided for the audience is something magnificent.

If you really look into the movie and try to get the very idea of it, there is just no chance that you'll stay untouched.

211,Moviegirlxyz,I thought this movie was awesome!,10,27 January 2014,"Spoiler alert. I was apparently at the same showing as the previous reviewer who did not enjoy this movie. I was one of the 150 wait listed and just barely got in to the sold out show. Only ten on the wait list got in. I am so glad I did because this turned out to be my favorite film at Sundance - I liked it even better than Whiplash which won the Grand Jury Dramatic prize and Audience award.It had a similar impact on me as did the movie, Contact. It asks what if? It explores the intersection of the spiritual and science - just as Contact did. The science of biometrics is relatively new and I can imagine a growing data base of biometric eye scan data where supposedly, there can only be one signature per person just like fingerprints. If that is so, then what might it mean if duplicates are found? What might it mean if a duplicate is found of a deceased person? What if a person who has a duplicate of a deceased person's eye scan also has a deep, unconscious memory of things in the deceased person's life? This was not a perfect movie - left hanging was what should be done about a severe breech of ethics on the part of a medical doctor who wanted to examine the protagonist's child on the ""pretense"" of following up on early signs of autism. Also, the protagonist had a serendipitous experience with the number 11, the meaning of which was never resolved.Still, I expect this movie will generate a lot of dialog and buzz as more and more people see it.Great movie.",I Origins

The science started to mingle in with a bit infatuation and romance and I almost fell off my chair in horror and sadness with the scenes around the 45minute mark which had me fixated in the plot.As most films do, if you watch them carefully enough, drop the hints to the ending but with this in a good way and the ending did an absolutely amazing job of building you up, then knocking you down and the film finished with me crying more than I have ever with any film.I love this film so much and I would like to thank the writer and director Mike Carhill for this and I now plan to watch the rest of his films.

It's not over-reaching, excessively trying to convince you. Not is it too fast paced - a blur of cut scenes and CGI. It is halting, taking its time, letting the story and its implications sink in. The director also treats the audience with a respect so rare these days. Not trying to explain every single detail, letting us work things on our own.The overlap of two opposing ideas - science and faith - is cleverly and maturely handled, giving the movie a balance.

222,nikkigrossman,Absolutely beautiful film that is still resonating a full day later,9,27 June 2014,"Saw I, Origins last night at a pre-screening in NYC and absolutely fell in love with the film. It moved at a pace that I felt was perfect for the amount of pertinent information the viewer was being provided relevant to the story line. The shots, locations, and overall cinematography was quite beautiful as well - not quite a 10, but at no point was I NOT satisfied with the camera work so I'll give it a solid 8 on that end.With respect to the concept in general -- WOW! A full 24 hours later and I am still going over the ""WHAT IF"" of what this film proposes. I don't want to give too many spoilers on the overall message of the film, but man, what a beautiful world we would live in if there was any truth to this film's suggestion.I have seen quite a few mixed reviews regarding the film - i was even nervous going into it based on rotten tomatoes -- but I can't express enough how absolutely beautiful the message, the visuals, the dialogue, and the feeling you walk out of the theater with are.The reviewer who said it was a waste of 2 hours, hofeling-ruby - initially i agreed w/ you that the religious leaders role was a bit confusing but much like the entire premise of this film, the purpose of the character seems to have escaped you. The character served simply as a distraction to the viewer at a very integral moment toward the end of the film. Had the character not been awkward and someone anyone in their right mind would want to avoid - then Ian and the girl would not have taken an alternative method to get up to the hotel room. The same purpose is served in the awkwardness the viewer feels when seeing a man and a young child walking hand and hand into a hotel. You are forced as a viewer at that moment to focus solely on the discomfort of what you're looking at-- and as a result, you miss something that is right in front of your face in the camera shot. That same something comes into play shortly thereafter during the film's ultimate climax. I can't think of a better way for the director to have redirected our minds than the use of this otherwise purposeless character.Kudos to Mike Cahill",I Origins

This movie is so obviously just a tool used for transhumanist agenda predictive programming. I'm not a religious man but I hate the way it deems religious people as childish and on the flip side it bolsters the stereotype that all atheists are god hating. Also is it just me or does the main character seem a little too hipsterish and angsty to be a scientist. The character development is good if they intended to make the main character look like a complete asshole the guys girlfriend is horribly mutilated right before his eyes and what two weeks later he's already screwing the only other female character in the movie. The science is all wrong as well. Evolution isn't something that can be replicated by the flip of a few genes in a petri dish. The acting is okay but nothing special. The cinematography is at least decent and the movie has some interesting ideas and concepts going for it. But the characters are all contrived except for the female scientist.

The end did not have the impact I expect the writers/directors thought it might. Just ended up being mildly engaging but mostly boring. The acting was average at best. Watched this movie with 8 other people. All had similar views. If the primary driver for a movie is to entertain, then quite simply this movie is a fail.

230,p-dimitrov-10,Beautiful yet all kinds of controversial,7,27 December 2014,"Viewers are divided - some love the film, others don't. The ones who enjoy it perhaps do so because of it's beauty and nice dark tone. The viewer is immediately transported to a universe completely different from ours - a bubble of selected moments in the world of a handful of characters none of whom have a clear background. While this may incline some viewers to think characters are two-dimensional, (which is a legitimate criticism), the story still works, so perhaps this was intentional or even if not, it doesn't harm the plot that much because the main purpose of the film (other than to make money and make the name of everyone involved, of course, let's not forget that,) is to spread a heartwarming message. It all goes on. Nobody truly disappears. Many viewers, however, will feel unease which goes beyond the basic mechanics of filmmaking and into the realm of the social. The main character is quite wealthy and gets to travel around the world in hopes of proving a wild theory (which by the way is not a realistic pursuit for an academic), while his young lover is a poor confused, possibly uneducated woman who conveniently dies to give way to his perfect life and then transforms to an even poorer person, which the main can conduct experiments on. There's also a brief moment of strange promiscuity at the beginning. It is beautifully done and showcases the sporadic character of Sofi, but it will cause a lot of negative reviews with the loss of stars being attributed to something else - whatever's at hand. Also, whenever the scientific and the spiritual clash, scientists never ever take the side of the divine with such blind faith. Ian's reaction to the eye repeating would have been 1. there's a glitch in the software, 2. if eyes appear again, then they are not as unique as we thought (not immediately deducting that it must be supernatural), 3. ... and that would happen early on, he will know very well that the 11s or any other 'sign' is pure coincidence, since all of us, but especially scientists, grow out of their self-centered specialness early on. Still, because we know so little about Ian, it can become consistent given the appropriate back story. My main issue with the premise of the film is that even if considered legitimate, it's not as spectacular as one would presume. It was a stroke of genius to make a spiritual phenomenon impossible to prove with science, but given the wide variety of socioeconomic backgrounds souls jump to and from, the world would be exactly the same, inhabited by almost unique people who have some simple emotional reactions to trauma from past lives. A much more intense and truly sci-fi plot would have been gathering information on these associations and using them in some way. (yes, actually, why is this film sci fi? It's definitely closer to fantasy). All in all, the film is good. It sells comfort and it does it well. The final scene was truly moving even without three-dimensional characters. Overall, well executed and therefore a 7/10 from me. But don't trust critics, see it for yourself. Chances are if you are an academic you won't like it very much, but if a part of you is a filmmaker or writer, you will appreciate the way it plays with your feelings.",I Origins
231,online-206-403779,"none needed, read another persons...",4,7 January 2015,"To me everything starts and ends with the story...the screenplay.If that is lacking in depth in any way, it will taint the rest of the film, unless you are a complete genius director AND editor...so I will begin by saying the story was lacking.The more films I watch the more I realize that the most important aspect of story is the character development...their journey, point A to point Z and the believability of how they got there.The most important aspect of character for the individuals in the audience is to identify - to feel for the characters in some way - Good feelings or bad feelings...doesn't matter, just make the viewer feel the character by identifying.so having said all that...I stopped the movie about halfway in and realized I didn't feel connected to either main characters. Even when the french model lover died...yes it was horrifying, but I didn't feel the loss. I did feel somewhat for Brit Marlings character, but that soon wore off as the movie progressed.This wasn't a character driven film...it was concept driven, which is fine, especially one with a cool concept as it had, but no matter what the driving force is behind a film, you have to reel me in (no pun intended, but cute none the less :) ) with characters that move me, ones I can identify with. I need nuance..and its not up to the actors to provide that, it has to be in the story and through the direction...The actors were all competent and have shown brilliance in this film at moments and other films they've played in...so its not their job to create nuance, its their job to respond with nuance, if its in the story, and in the direction.The Story itself seemed unsure of what its main theme was, it kept bouncing from the evolution of the eye and the concept of perceptions, to the star crossed love interest of two seeming opposites, to the idea of reincarnation...Please pick two and stick with that, go deep into them! If you want a film that deals with all three of these same ideas and does an excellent job...go see The Fountain! IM not going to bash the science cause it would take too long to research even near as much as the writer did, but I'm guessing there was some creative license..Im totally OK with creative license.The shooting was well done in general and at times truly beautiful.The editing was good, solid.If you try to create a concept and plot driven film, it better be spot on, and keep me on my seat.If you try to create a character driven film I better be able to feel for the characters, and identify with them...really get to know them.I Origins did neither. And it did neither for a whopping hour and 40 minutes! If you want a good study into a film that doesn't really work, but has some beautiful shots and cool concept then watch it as an education...If you want a film that grabs you early on, brings you into their world, makes you love the characters, or love to hate them, and sends you on your way satisfied...then pass on this one.",I Origins
232,dtw57,Really loved it...,9,17 January 2015,"In July 2014 I was driving a tiny rental car from Pennsylvania to Michigan on a solo business trip. About three hours into the drive, somewhere in the vicinity of Toledo, OH, I dialed up an episode of the podcast, ""The Q&A with Jeff Goldsmith"", a show mostly about screen writing. The episode I chose randomly was an interview with Mike Cahill, Writer-Director of I Origins. For 80 minutes I listened to Jeff interview Mike about various aspects of the development and execution of this movie. The concept really intrigued me and I was impressed by Cahill's approach to the creative process. I've been very anxious to see the finished product ever since.Today I finally saw I Origins in the Red Box and immediately rented it. Based on what I came away with after listening to the podcast, I had high hopes for this movie. I prepared myself to be disappointed, but it didn't happen. I thought the actors performances were excellent and the cinematography was beautiful. If you get on board with the concept, this movie will really take you on an emotional ride.Time well spent. Thanks Mike Cahill.",I Origins
233,smsavage32,Fox news writes a sci-fi.,1,24 January 2015,"Suspension of disbelief is a key element for any story.Which makes I Origins horrible for anyone who understands anything about biology. Yes... this is sci-fi and as such does not need to be accurate in any way shape or form. But, because this is set in what is expected to be a real world lab doing real-world science, the apparently deliberate twisting of how evolution work is detrimental to suspension of disbelief. I say ""deliberate"" because the twisting of evolutionary science reads like a who's who list of Christian anti-evolutionary propaganda. All of which is presented as if real scientists would be using anti- evolutionary ideas in their biological research instead of real science.A ""Master switch"" in the genetic code that can ""turn on"" the growth of an eye in a creature that hasn't already evolved one so that it doesn't need an ""intelligent designer""? Really? However, for those who know nothing about evolution or are convinced that what they pass off as evolution on Sunday mornings is real, their suspension of disbelief will be unharmed.In other areas, the character's motives appear random, and the personality's fall into two categories:A. The wise, sane, calm, and generally helpful people who believe in God.B. The erratic, quick to anger, and generally selfish people who do not believe in God.As one would expect from a film that uses anti-evolution talking points as the bases of ""science"", the random motives are all coming from the godless characters who fly into fits of anger for absolute no reason whatsoever.Lastly, (and I'm being deliberately vague here so that I don't include a spoiler) the actions of the main character at the end of the movie would only make sense to those who are religious in some way or another.I am giving this movie only 1 star ONLY because I feel that science is important to the world and this movie does a good job misinforming people of what science is and how science works. (Sci-fi considerations considered)Not withstanding my one star rating, I would say that this movie would be great for those who go to church regularly. It will validate their world view quite well.",I Origins
234,dj_wyorks,I Origins ...what did you HONESTLY like about it?,3,13 February 2015,"Now i'm going to be really truthful here, as a biotechnologist (by trade) I must evaluate this film on what my head said and my 'lazy' film arse said.The film took too long in getting 'moving', although if you consider a shag on a toilet brilliant, then watch it again as he nor her pulls down their 'tommorow's washing.'How he 'hooked up' with the lady he just 'bonked' on a toilet, it's stretching the imagination of social media. No model would seriously tell the general public where she/he has coffee on a regular basis.The end was simply a disappointment, it left me thinking how much else the people behind the film could have arranged to answer the many questions the film brought up.The film goes down in my opinion as a so-so film, as there wasn't anything memorable about the film I could talk to somebody in say ten years time; I will have totally forgotten i ever watched it.",I Origins
235,brandnkyl,Thought provoking!,7,17 February 2015,"I've read a couple reviews on here and it seems that people are over thinking the thing about the numbers. The numbers were never very important, when they discuss the numbers she said ""I was sending them to you"", meaning she was also searching for him (not literally). So when he puts the billboard up searching for her, he is sending his....erm mental probe? out to her. Who knows she may have been following a white rabbit. The numbers were not important what was is that they had a connection and they were willing the other person to find them. Sorry it just really bugged me that people were complaining about something trivial when the whole movie is about forgetting the data and go on faith.",I Origins
236,roebies,Gets you thinking about your soul,10,13 June 2015,"Some people may say there's no actual meaning to the religious man in the hotel: wroooong it's just a man he encounters who happens to be his complete opposite. Later in the film they use that man as a reason for Ian to take the stairs. He was waiting for the elevator and that was the reason Ian took the stairs with Salomina. Also some say the characters have no dept: that Sofi is just a shallow hot foreign girl. She is alternative, believes in spiritual things and is YOUNG. Also she is a (eye)model who lives in a completely different country than where she came from. Of course she seems shallow, because if spirituality means nothing to you, her character is not deep either. Her personality is childish and a bit naive (for those who are more on Ian's side of opinion) and that is why she seems shallow. Which she is not. Also the thing with the elevens and so... Ian might not believe in religion or spiritual worlds but that doesn't mean he isn't a tiny bit superstitious. Believing in God and believing in faith is something very different. That doesn't make the character shaky..Just wanted to react on some reviews, which wasn't possible directly. So did it this way :)CONCLUSION I loved the movie. Absolutely beautiful. Maybe not completely scientifically right: I have absolutely no idea. I think Sofi made a beautiful point in the lab: The worms can't see or feel the light, although it is there all around them, consuming them. I am not a religious person but she was right: we don't have proof there ISN'T a God. We probably have more proof of there actually being something than there being nothing. Stay open-minded people :)",I Origins
237,kaichuenlim,Really? You're going with an argument answered in the first edition of Origin of Species?,1,31 August 2015,"My first thoughts was that I wanted to strangle that girl throughout the film for every single straw-man and logical fallacy she built and used. Ooooh no senses, we have something we call Science to make up for our inability to sense something, we use devices to detect that thing's effect on the world around us, that entire, ""What if there's a spirit realm like light and we're just blind.""Sorry, fallacies make me unreasonably angry.As my summary says, this film's opening premise has already been debunked, by Charles Darwin himself.This already shows just how much, or how biased the research the writer put into this film. Well acted and paced hilarious misrepresentation of atheistic thought.",I Origins
238,jcarr-68964,"A very engaging, human and flawlessly written film",10,15 July 2015,"It has been a long time since I've come across a film that I enjoyed this much. It moved me to write me first review here. The writing, especially the dialogue and a few subtle yet effective visual connections, convey the story beautifully without trying to hit you over the head or being preachy.As far as the plot goes, it is admittedly a bit of a stretch that an ocular biologist would be so obsessed with disproving religion rather than just advancing scientific inquiry. That being said, the device works to set up the ""there's so much we don't understand"" premise. The best trait of the plot is its uncluttered nature. It stays on target and does not over reach or attempt to over explain; it merely unfolds.I particularly like the fact that it invests more than half the movie in the character set up, which I understand some people do not like. In this way it feels more like a good book. This is particularly true of the import placed on the connection Ian and Sofie have even though they're connection is necessarily instant. Without the investment the impact would not be the same. The wisdom and faith of children and the innocent premise in the face of all sensory proof to the contrary, complete with the cycle of life elements were weaved in flawlessly. The viewer can easily connect some of these parts to feelings or experiences in their own lives and feel validated for having stopped and noticing and even pondering them from time to time. It asks you to think and feel in equal measure and as most good movies do, resolves itself with subtle beauty. I highly recommend this movie and look forward towards seeing other work by Mike Cahill.",I Origins
239,bobbysvm,great movie,10,5 December 2015,excellent movie .watching with pain and astonishment. somebody negatively reviewed this movie about religion and science. this movie is about struggle between chance and faith. this is not a movie about fight between science and religion.very carefully filmed from one scene to another scene. all the characters did very well. the director did the unique work. I think director did a lot of work to create this movie. filmed in different parts .music composed for this movie is also very good.music created according to the scenes and with intellectual touch . very interesting story from starting to end. I felt so fortunate to see this movie.,I Origins
240,jmartinez-69106,not a movie for all,10,4 January 2016,"The best movie of last the couple of years.Plot that is totally unpredictable.Acting that seems not like action but real persons.A soundtrack that stays with you.In the end the movie is about you and what would you do if confronted with your beliefs being dashed?Not for everyone.Could that man in the elevator have been ""The Man""? After the credits and the project was starting to run, why were the obvious evil persons not showing up as a reincarnation?? Should't they have returned to get it right the next time?",I Origins
241,BryantFootesJr,Inspirational movie and a masterpiece in my eye's,10,15 January 2016,"If you're looking for a film that has breath taking cinematography and an amazing story, this is a great movie to see. For viewers that are not believers of the spiritual world, I recommend it to you. It will change your views on the topic and jump-start the gears in your head into deep thought. For all others that are believes of the spiritual world this movie will push you to think deeper into your beliefs and ultimately bring you closer to your divine beliefs. The first time I saw this I was completely blown away and could not wait to share it with others.This film contains deep symbolism in the imagery and deep philosophical dialogue. If you are looking to embark on a philosophical journey this is it. The acting was great and kept me fully engaged. This is the movie that inspired me to pursue a career in filmmaking.",I Origins
242,terrysuki,Sci Fi???,1,16 March 2020,"This ridiculous movie is nothing more than a chick flick masquerading as ""Sci Fi"". It's about as ""Sci Fi"" as my last bowel movement, and as ""deep"" as one of Peppa Pig's muddy puddles! And not even as scientifically literate as Peppa Pig! If you're into New Age rubbish and the kind of low IQ trash peddled by the likes of Deepack Chopra then you'll love this nonsense.
If, on the other hand, you're a science fiction fan, scientifically literate to at least UK secondary school level, then this is not for you.

If you want to believe #spoiler .... that the girl remembers the lift from a previous life you can.

244,jillmackay-18454,"Great themes, inconsistent delivery",5,16 July 2016,"My vote would have been much higher if it weren't for the ridiculously violent and graphic death of Sonja. It doesn't fit with the rest of the film, and actually detracts significantly from it. One minute I'm watching a thoughtful film that explores some great themes like science vs. faith, the next minute, I thought I was watching a horror film (e.g. Resident Evil....). I knew in advance from the trailer what the story was about therefore that she dies death was not a surprise. Plus there was a significant about of foreshadowing that lead to that moment so it was not unexpected. However, HOW it happened was simultaneously violent yet unrealistic. It was excessively dramatic and generally off-putting. It ruined the rest of the movie for me because I couldn't get the image out of my head.",I Origins
245,romania_corina,I origins,10,6 November 2016,"<< I origins >> is a wonderful and complex sci-fi romance about a skeptical biologist who is fascinated by the human eye and their uniqueness. At a costume party he meets Sofi and becomes obsessed with her green eyes. Eventually , they begin a wild and passionate relationship that is going to change completely his vision of the world. This is definitely one of my all-time favorite movies that I can watch several times and still find new and inspiring elements. The cast is wonderfully chosen and the dialogues are impressive. Another strong point of the movie is the outstanding soundtrack which leaves you with a warm feeling long after the end of the story. I would strongly recommend this film to those who enjoy intriguing debates between science and religion.",I Origins
246,benolard,Much feelings,7,8 November 2016,"For sure that's a movie which won't let you untroubled. Probably it is better not to know anything about the movie before watching it. For it has surprising (and sometimes sad) moments and takes paths you don't expect at first. The way it is shoot is very poetic, many shots are beautiful and even a little ""ethereal"", let's say. It made me feel like the movie was some sort of dream. In addition the actors are doing their job quite well, so you're never took outside this strange experience. Still, this is not perfect, the movie open the thinking for a lot of things without any real and clear conclusion. Sure it fits the general atmosphere of the movie. But in the end, you ask yourself ""Did the director had clear thought in mind for this or that ?""Anyway, it is certainly a good experience and I recommend it ! Especially if you want to discover something unusual and different from mainstream movies.",I Origins

248,gregoryjharrison,Not impressed with the story but good acting,3,21 April 2017,"So the beginning was good and cute....and then out of nowhere they killed off the most likable character extremely unnecessarily. What's even worse is that although she was in the start of the film she doesn't have a place in the IMDb synopsis, probably because of how irrelevant she became. Me and my brother stopped watching after she died because it was so uncalled for, I understand when show's like The Walking Dead kill off main characters to show us how hard their life is but it really winds me up when the producers feel the need to include it in these movies where it just isn't needed. It ruined the whole film for me, it was as though she was introduced to be killed off.The way she died was awful as well, instead of having her legs crushed off couldn't they have just let the elevator fall so we don't have to see all that gore. I don't understand why they felt the need to kill her off anyway and it was horrible that the movie moved so quickly afterwards...Ian gets together with his lab partner, they publish a book, they become famous and have a child...then it starts to slow down a little. Why change the pace like that? It's so annoying. I am really disappointed because of how it well it was going.The reason I gave this film 3 stars is because although they unnecessarily killed off the sweetest character the acting was good. I would have much preferred the film if they didn't kill her and allowed the relationship to blossom. It would have been a lot better being a romance than a sci-fi that feels the need to include this random death.RIP Sofi",I Origins
