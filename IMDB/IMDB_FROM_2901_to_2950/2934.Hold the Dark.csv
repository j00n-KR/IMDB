0,Leofwine_draca,Challenging,8,7 October 2018,"The third recent picture from director Jeremy Saulnier, following on from his BLUE RUIN and GREEN ROOM (two films I thought were excellent), HOLD THE DARK is a tougher, more challenging picture that takes more effort from the viewer going in. This is no longer a simple, pared-down revenge thriller like his previous pictures, but something more subtle and less clearly-defined. The excellent Jeffrey Wright plays a wolf expert who arrives in a small Alaskan town to investigate a child taken by a wolf pack. He soon discovers that he's in a place populated by some very disturbed individuals indeed. Saulnier's film is a slow burner that commands close attention and is very satisfying despite providing no easy answers. As ever, long stretches are broken by sudden, shocking twists and bursts of violence that'll have you wincing. There's at least one jaw-dropping set-piece and some great acting from the likes of James Badge Dale and Alexander Skarsgard. The ending fizzles very slightly, but overall HOLD THE DARK is a fresh, engaging picture that reminded me of the similarly dark Korean picture THE WAILING.",Hold the Dark
1,SnoopyStyle,a bit muddled,5,12 October 2018,"Medora Slone's young son was taken by wolves. He's not the only one. She recruits wolf expert Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright) to hunt down the wolf responsible. Her husband Vernon (Alexander Skarsgård) returns from serving a disturbing tour in Iraq.It's dark. It's grumpy. It's mumbled silence. The story telling is a bit jagged. The movie should center solely on Jeffrey Wright and he should be more active. A lot of times, he is the wise black guy trying to help the mostly white people. It's an old trope of the magical black man. He should have more enterprise. I want Wright to be a bright shining star rather than a pin light in the murky sky. There is one memorable big shoot out action scene. I question some of the action of the cops. I would think they try to flank the one gun position which only one guy attempts. The good aspect comes from the power of the gun. The bullets can punch through which is more realistic and scarier. It heightens the tension. Overall, I do like Wright and the dark moodiness but not the jagged and muddled story telling.",Hold the Dark
2,nogodnomasters,Anchorage is not Alaska,8,17 October 2018,"Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright) is an author on wolves. He is contacted by Medora Slone (Riley Keough) who lives in northern Alaska and that is all she knows. Her son was taken by a wolf and she wants Mr. Core to hunt down the wolf. Medora is a bit spacey, but Core agrees. Her husband Vernon (Alexander Skarsgård) is fighting overseas in ""not a real war."" He is eerily quiet and a man of extreme action. At 35 minutes we get the first twist, followed by another one 15 minutes later. The twists is what holds your attention. There is a lot of local things about the dark sky, being born ""unnatural"" and using wolf's oil as a cure. It also discusses savaging. It is the type of film that could have been adopted to the Louisiana Bayou. Not for everyone and I am not sure I understood the theme or the ending. Guide: F-word.

3,kosmasp,Or don't ... whatever works,7,17 April 2019,"While not as gripping as The Grey or rather focused I should say, this has quite some momentum. The acting is really something to behold and the story and characters are really out there (no pun intended). So while this may feel to uncertain or mysterious to some (you might have more questions about the whole thing after it is over than you had before), it might be exactly what others might have been looking for.Characters are very weird and I reckon you could also call them sketchy. There is an aura surrounding them and there is mythological strands woven into many things. If you are into that sort of thing and believe in certain things, the movie gives you freedom to read certain things into it. So in that regard the movie is rich and deep - but will it be enough to also be entertaining enough for the viewer? That I can't answer for you",Hold the Dark
4,classicsoncall,"""I can see you need to let the wolf out a little.""",7,1 June 2020,"Ahh, if only I'd read the book first! A number of reviewers for the movie here on IMDb explain details that aren't made readily apparent in the movie, which on reflection make perfect sense, but are mentioned only briefly and casually in the picture so it's almost impossible to make the connection. I think the film could have been scripted to add a little more understanding of the relationship between Medora (Riley Keough) and Vernon (Alexander Skarsgård) Slone, because knowing their actual relationship would have added a lot of clarity to the story, if not a creepiness factor added to the proceedings. I did get engaged in the picture, but when it came to the very ending, I had the same kind of reaction as I did with ""No Country For Old Men"", which leaves the viewer with a huge question mark hanging over one's head. What I can tell you about movies cast with Native American individuals, I get the biggest kick out of the names of the players. This one had Julian Black Antelope as the renegade Yup'ik Cheeon, and a supporting cast that included Joseph Whitebird, Tantoo Cardinal and Karen Powderface. You can't get more authentic that that.",Hold the Dark

Silly people who have subscribed to Nerflix are ready to watch any item available, without checking first if they are made for them. Proposing such a masterpiece to those dudes is like giving caviar to pigs; it's a very complex film, that I have myself not entirely followed and I measure how much it deserves to be seen at least three or four times.

7,Aaron1375,Did I miss something?,6,9 October 2018,"I see this movie is a bit polarizing here on IMDB as some people describe it as a masterpiece and it is only us stupid Americans that do not understand its brilliance while others hate it saying it is a pointless movie with virtually no plot. Where do I fall in? I say it was an interesting movie that does fall apart due to the fact it literally had a non-ending. Seriously, us Americans may not be as smart as you Europeans, but this film literally had no ending, any idiot could see that. Oh, and by the way, movies here in America are made with explosives and all that stuff and pretty much dumbed down for European and other foreign lands so take that for what it is worth. I enjoyed aspects of this film very much and I thought it was racing towards some thrilling conclusion, but it seems to me someone did not know how they wanted this thing to end. Either the director did not like the original ending in the book, or the book had a really anticlimactic end to it and the director didn't want to change it (yes, this film is based on a book).So, the story has a woman whose son is apparently killed by a wolf writing to a man who has written a book about a wolf he had tracked and killed. He comes to the very isolated community to at first try to reason with the woman, but then decides to try and hunt the wolf; however, he is not there one day before this woman is acting very strangely. Her husband is injured in the Middle East and he too behaves a bit strangely. At first, one thinks that perhaps they are just in shock over the loss of their son, but soon the wolf hunter learns that the boy was killed by his mother and she goes on the run setting off a violent pursuit by the husband who kills anyone in his way while the hunter looks on stunned by the violence that begins to rule the day. The film at times seemed as if something supernatural was going on, and that could be the case, but I cannot say for sure because the movie just kind of ends without any type of real resolution. The film is about a descent into darkness where the husband and wife seem to be becoming more animal like in nature and me and my fiance started to think that perhaps the wife was a werewolf and she wanted the hunter to kill her, but then the husband comes in and starts killing everyone who had nothing to do with his son's death. Apparently, in the book the wife and husband were also brother and sister; however, this is not as clear in the film as only a couple of clues hinted at this relationship between the two. Still doesn't explain their motives or the lack of an ending.So, it was an interesting watch and I would have scored the film higher, but the ending totally came out of nowhere and was so anticlimactic that it ruined all that had preceded it. I am curious to read the book now just to see if it too ended in such a fashion, or what I would hope to find something that brings closure to the story. I was watching this and then the film ended and both me and my fiance were like, ""WTH!"" Made me think the thing ended prematurely or something. Still, good acting, good setting, this film just needed some work in terms of the story and the finish.",Hold the Dark

Riley Keough plays the troubled mother and Alexander Skarsgård her taciturn husband coming home from Iraq. James Badge Dale appears as the local sheriff while Julian Black Antelope is on hand as a curious AmerIndian named Cheeon.""Hold the Dark"" (2018) is a combination mystery/drama/adventure/thriller/horror. It's original, unpredictable and dead serious with elements of movies like ""The Grey"" (2011), ""Runaway Train"" (1985), ""Wendigo"" (2001), ""The Frozen Ground"" (2013), ""The North Star"" (1996), ""Joyride"" (1977) and ""The Edge"" (1997), not to mention a ""Apocalypse Now"" (or Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness) and even a little from the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, albeit without the goofiness. Imagine if the band Agalloch made a movie and that's pretty much ""Hold the Dark"" (there's even a snippet from an Agalloch-like band in the movie).It's based on the book by William Giraldi and some viewers have complained that key revelations weren't obvious enough in the film. Well, I never read the book and wasn't able to figure out these revelations, but this didn't prevent me from appreciating this artistic nigh masterpiece. Afterward, I looked-up the revelations and they put the pieces of the puzzle together; yet the clues are all there (in the movie) if you watch closely. My wife watched the film separately and WAS able to glean these revelations. But, again, not being able to figure out every detail did NOT prevent me from valuing this great movie.The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada (Lethbridge & Calgary), and Morocco.GRADE: A-/A",Hold the Dark
9,trashgang,great atmosphere,9,6 January 2019,"Available on Netflix, my father-in-law told me to go watch this one. He assured me it was great but a flick not for everybody. After seeing it I must agree.For me this was a great movie made by Netflix. Just like Apostle (2018) this is on teh bloody side and sometimes it even comes in the gory area. It's nbot a horror, but it do has some creepy moments. I liked this a lot due the place it takes place and the excellent performance by Alexander Skarsgård. What he delivers here is really top notch. Perfect casting. I can't say what it's all about because I would have to spoil a lot but if you can dig mysterious flicks with an edgy side and gory effects then this is a must see. Again, many disliked it by that reason but the score, the acting and the atmosphere throughout this flick made it for me one of the best movies of 2018!

10,sddavis63,A Long And Ponderous Anti-Thriller,2,16 February 2019,"To give credit where credit is due, director Jeremy Saulnier uses the darkness of an Alaskan winter and the loneliness of the Alaskan wilderness to very good effect to create a sense of bleakness and emptiness. The truly unfortunate thing is that aside from that I can't think of anything about this that's redeeming. It's long and ponderous. The pacing is terrible; the story is a muddle that really just left me baffled. It starts as the search for a missing child. Bailey has apparently been taken by wolves in a remote Alaskan town, and his mother (Riley Keogh) hires a hunter (Jeffrey Wright) to track down the wolf and kill it. But the story eventually morphs into a murder mystery - but one with no real explanation that I could figure out. In addition to its mostly long and ponderous story there are some moments of graphic violence thrown in - but they don't really add much to the story except making it even more confusing (if that's possible.) I have to confess that when this came to a merciful (if completely unsatisfying) end I was relieved, and regretted that I had wasted two hours of my life with it. ""Hold The Dark"" is billed as a thriller, but to be perfectly honest I'd say it's the very epitome of an anti-thriller! (2/10)",Hold the Dark
11,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Gets the atmosphere just right, but doesn't really form into a satisfying whole",7,9 October 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRussell Core (Jeffrey Wright) is a retired survivalist and Iraq war veteran, who has been called to the snowy climbs of Alaska by Melora Slone (Riley Keough), a local woman whose young son has gone missing. She has no hope of getting her son back, she simply wants Core to find the wolf that took him (???!!!??? I know) and exact revenge (hope he finds the right wolf.) But when Melora's husband Vernon (Alexander Skarsgard), a man deeply damaged by his experiences in Iraq, returns home, events are plunged into a terrifying and sinister spiral, where nothing is as it seems.While undoubtedly sights of natural beauty and wonder, snow covered regions, especially those in mountain locations, still provide really effective backdrops for dark, moody thrillers, from the Coen Brother's Fargo to Stephen King's Misery. Hold the Dark, director Jeremy Saulnier's second feature after the dismal 2005 heavy metal thriller Green Room, continues this tradition, albeit to mixed effect. The set up is just right, and the air of mystery does work, but the execution and the eventual outcome decidedly fail to give it the resolution it deserves.Saulnier definitely doesn't skimp on the dark moodiness, and drenches his film in a blacked out, uncompromising glare that fills it with little hope or happiness. He also denies it pretty much anything in the way of humour or light relief, displaying characters that are consumed with regret and cynicism. The only vaguely uplifting thing is some wonderful overhead cinematography of the Alaskan mountains. In that sense it does what it says on the tin, the only trouble is a nonsensical set up that doesn't survive scrutiny (even if it has come from the mouth of a grieving mother) and a baffling ending that fails to adequately resolve something you've invested over two hours of your time in.It's infinitely better than Saulnier's last film, and it's faults do not crush its strengths, but Hold the Dark is a film with everything on the surface right, but some problems beneath the foundations that threaten to crash it all down. ***",Hold the Dark
12,ThomasDrufke,Plotting and Strange Narrative Choices,5,17 October 2018,"Surprisingly, the great Jeremy Saulnier didn't have a color in the title of 'Hold the Dark'. After the brilliant films Blue Ruin and Green Room, I thought for sure he would continue his good luck with another similar title. I guess in a way, Hold the Dark is referring to something visual (it's just based in Darkness not an actual color). But joking aside, I was exciting for this film, especially because all I had to do was pop on the TV and turn on Netflix. Does it live up to my expectations? I honestly can't say it does. What began as a fascinating premise about young children being mysteriously taken by Wolves in a remote Alaskan village, turned into a chaotic cult film about some other ideas that I simply just did not find all that interesting. I tend to love snowy films, specifically ones that deal with crime. It's just the genre I gravitate to. But Hold the Dark takes far too many detours and seemingly unexplainable choices to make for one confusing and convoluted narrative. Again tho, the performances and visuals/cinematography are marvelous. Just incredible to watch. But for me, it's not enough to persuade me to come around on some things that did not make much sense.5.9/10",Hold the Dark
13,Platypuschow,"Hold the Dark: I get the criticism, to an extent anyway",4,29 December 2018,"Hold the Dark is a bone of contention for Netflix users, the community seems thoroughly torn and I found myself pushing it up my watchlist because it was recommended to me.Upon reading reviews from the IMDB community the constants were a belief that the movie has no purpose, no ending and nothing is resolved. I disagree entirely and think that without coming across as some type of arrogant pseudo intellectual movie fan that they didn't understand it. Hold the Dark has several layers, and I get the impression that people missed out on a few critical plot points that weren't spoon fed but tantalizingly revealed over the course of the movie.So sure the movie is fairly clever, it just isn't very good. Despite a beautiful setting, Wright & Skarsgard putting in fantastic performances and all these wonderful little nuances that I believe people missed its just not that engaging.I'm saddened by this as it was certainly a movie I wanted to enjoy, I simply couldn't. For this reason I get the criticism to an extent, but would advise that people who didn't ""Get it"" either watch it again or use a spoiler site to explain it to them.The Good:Incredible settingStrong performancesQuite cleverly constructedThe Bad:Fails to really engage the viewerThings I Learnt From This Movie:All movies set in Alaska are actually filmed in CanadaAlexander Skarsgård is one of the most underutilized actors in HollywoodSoup choice is important even during the worst pain and strife",Hold the Dark

15,tomgillespie2002,Peppered with brilliance but Saulnier's weakest film to date,6,7 October 2018,"Whether you appreciate his genre-hopping and wince-inducingly violent movies or not, nobody could ever accuse director Jeremy Saulnier of lacking ambition. From the grisly, low-budget revenge picture Blue Ruin to the greasy punks/neo-Nazi stand-off of Green Room, Saulnier has always demonstrated the will to subvert our expectations, to carry us off into seemingly safe territory before slapping us across the face with a moment of utter savagery. It seems strange then, that Saulnier's most ambitious movie to date, the Alaskan-set 'mystery' Hold the Dark, debuted on the small screen via Netflix. The word mystery is in inverted commas because this is one of a few genres Hold the Dark dips its toes into, making for an unsettling and surprising film, but also a frustrating and confusing one. The scope is noticeably broader than Saulnier's previous efforts as the action hops between different continents and viewpoints, but Saulnier and writer Macon Blair fail to maintain a firm grasp of the story.In a small town out in the Alaskan wilderness a few children have gone missing - suspected of being taken away by wolves - and Bailey Sloane is the latest to disappear. His mother, Medora (Riley Keough) writes to Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright), a naturalist who has written a book about his experiences killing a wolf, in the hope that he will hunt down the animals responsible. He agrees, curious of Medora's motivations, and the two damaged, introverted characters form a quiet bond through shared loneliness. Meanwhile, Medora's husband Vernon (Alexander Skarsgard), a soldier fighting in Afghanistan (the film takes place in 2004), is notified of his son's abduction. His own wife describes him as an animal, and we quickly understand why. A towering, fearsome figure, Vernon is a man who believes that murder is wholly justified, even necessary, when it comes to protecting the ones you love. When he arrives in town, all hell breaks loose, attracting the attention of the unprepared and unequipped local police force, led by chief Donald Marium (James Badge Dale).The synopsis is vague because to reveal any more would be to spoil the film's most interesting aspect, its sheer unpredictability. The first hour draws you in with its sombre and almost threatening atmosphere, as it seems to set up a familiar man vs beast scenario, and the ethical conundrums that come with it. It then takes a sharp, violent turn with a riveting set-piece that comes out of nowhere, and from then on you won't have a clue where you're heading. The main problem is that the film doesn't seem to know either, and when we finally arrive at a certain destination in the story, we don't really know where we are. The clashing tones and genre switches of Saulnier's previous movies felt organic and exciting, but the pieces don't quite fit together in Hold the Dark. If you were to view individual scenes, there's some great work here. Saulnier understands how to grab your attention and execute moments of brutality that don't feel gratuitous or exploitative, and an extended shoot-out that successfully blends horror and action is the film's most shocking and memorable moment. Wright is terrific too, but his pained whispers aren't enough to save this from being Saulnier's weakest film to date, made all the more frustrating by the fact that there are moments of brilliance throughout.",Hold the Dark
16,zkonedog,One Of The Worst Films I Have Ever Seen,1,3 January 2019,"Rarely do I ever start a film and not finish it. I respect the medium too much and want to give a movie a chance to tell its entire story. From time to time, however, something is so bad (boring, low-quality, or otherwise) that I have absolutely no desire to continue with it. That's exactly what happened in ""Hold The Dark"".For a nominal plot summary, this Netflix original sees Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright) summoned to the Alaskan wilderness to search for presumably a pack of wolves that has been kidnapping children. When he arrives, however, he finds that the mystery of the Alaskan village may lie deeper than simple wild animals.The major problem with ""Hold The Dark"" is that for nearly an hour of runtime (when I tapped out), absolutely nothing happens save for long shots of the Alaskan tundra and some dialogue about Native American mysticism that is in no way compelling. I have no problems with ""slow"" films if character development or setup is taking place, but even that doesn't transpire. It truly is an hour of nothingness that had those around me succumbing to sleep almost instantly.I'm disappointed that an actor with the pedigree (especially recently with Westworld) of Wright would attach himself to such a project. I know that Netflix is constantly luring more big-time actors to star in their original content, but even the most accomplished thespian couldn't make headway with this plodder.Netflix is starting to have as many critical ""hits"" as ""misses"" these days, but this is one to avoid at all costs (unless perhaps your passion in life is outdoor cinematography). I can't comment on ""how it all turns out"" because I didn't make it to the end, but I can confidently say that no matter what would have transpired in the final 50 minutes, it would not have rectified the boringness of the ""front nine"".",Hold the Dark
17,eddie_baggins,A slow and emotionally cold thriller,5,2 October 2018,"After two solid thriller's in the last few years, that included the critically lauded and audience favourite Green Room, hype has been growing around upcoming director Jeremy Saulnier and his unique sensibilities in crafting mood, tension and outbursts of sensory assaulting violence.In light of this, there was growing interest in the filmmaker's adaptation of William Giraldi novel Hold the Dark, the directors highest profile and biggest budget release yet that has been championed by its distributer Netflix as one of the streaming giants premiere releases of the year.Unfortunately for Netflix and its director, Hold the Dark becomes a rather frustrating experience, made worse by the fact there is so much to like here and in many ways the film is close to being quite good, failing however to take the steps needed to make this become a reality, not just an unachieved possibility.Fans of Saulnier's previous works will instantly feel at home with Dark's slowly paced and well-filmed batch of thrills that takes its time in telling the story of Jeffrey Wright's wolf expert and writer Russell Core getting drawn into an increasingly ominous child disappearance case, that includes Riley Keough's depressed mother Medora Slone, Alexander Skarsgard as Medora's husband and war veteran Vernon and James Badge Dale's kindly local policeman Donald Marium, who all operate and live in the harsh surrounds of an icy Alaskan small town.It's an intriguing set-up and a great location for such a mystery to take place in, one that allows Saulnier and his DOP Magnus Nordenhof Jonck to capture some stunning and memorable imagery, yet the methodically snail-paced approach, the often quiet whisperings of the cast and the at times frustrating blurry motivations and insights of its narrative hold Dark back from becoming the film it could've been.Dark is a film with some great individual sequences, that includes a sojourn to the Middle East and a classily staged shoot out, that while completely over the top and unbelievable is a great showcase for Saulnier's growing talents behind the camera and this is a film that features some solid turns from its cast, that's anchored by Wright who always excels when given the chance to take a lead role but it's still not enough to fully immerse us in this world that seems so open to being explored further.From Core's dealings and experiences with studying wolves and searching for the Slone's boy, themes of racism and social injustices around the natives that live in the small community and the relationship between Medora and Vernon, Dark fails in giving these the airtime they deserve (which from my understanding is similar to the book on which it is based) but it's still a shame that Saulnier and his long time screenwriting collaborator Macon Blair failed to maximise these facets of the narrative.Final Say - Solid and memorable moments are to be found within Hold the Dark, including its stunning location and surrounds but this is a rather icy affair that fails to invest us into its story that unfortunately keeps us at an arm's length distance throughout, making Saulnier's film another disappointing Netflix outing.2 ½ incompetent shooters out of 5",Hold the Dark

Meanwhile the woman's soldier husband, played by Alexander Skarsgard, has just been wounded in some Middle Eastern country & is shipped back home to hear the news of his son. After a fruitless investigation, Wright finds the mother gone & her son's body in the basement of her home suggesting she killed him which when coupled w/the returning veteran instigates a series of violent acts that really end up adding up to nothing. Some pseudo Native American justice comes into play as the soldier & his Indian buddy decide to hunt the fled woman but plow through many bodies to get there. There is some potent scenes but having an empty cypher who just watches the events transpiring around him w/o affecting any change makes him a non-starter as a protagonist.

24,jadepietro,Dim,5,16 October 2018,"GRADE: C THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A murder mystery that doesn't hold up.JIM'S REVIEW: Hold the Dark doesn't hold together very well as a film. Its mystery remains one, long after the end credits roll. While there is much to admire in some scenes, the overall plot is muddled and characters and their actions are murky. When they begin to talk in the abstract and metaphysically about their lives, we know it will be a long winter's night for those people on and off the screen, namely us moviegoers.A child (or three) have disappeared in a strange Alaskan village with the prime suspect being a pack of wolves. A distraught mother calls an nature author (huh?) to help locate her missing boy. His father returns from war to solve the mystery himself by any means possible. And the body count climbs as do the suggested supernatural possibilities.The film is high on atmospheric touches and low on logical plot lines. The action is paced so slowly and so is most of the line delivery. Story-wise, everything is episodic and choppy, and Macon Blair's screenplay never comes to terms with any solid narrative structure. Director Jeremy Saulnier stages some scenes most effectively. The film's highlight is a long graphically violent shoot-out that occurs at the midway point which shows a young director's talent on creating suspense and his almost obscene delight in wallowing in gore while proving the irrationality of supporting the 2nd Amendment. (Some advice for future movies...of which, I hope, there will be a fine future, Mr. Saulnier : Lesson One...Less is More...and, Lesson 2: Substance Matters as Well as Style.)The cast is left stranded in the wilderness. Only James Badge Dale as the sheriff has any real depth. Jeffrey Wright plays the writer and he spend most of the movie looking agape or running away from danger. (He should have run away from this script.) Why his character stays with these odd citizens and is the most unanswered question of many. The talented Alexander Skarsgård broods well but he is being stereotyped as an evil presence which seems second nature to him now. Riley Keough plays Medora, a role that seems incomplete and an enigma throughout the movie.Hold the Dark gets lost in the dark and should have been much better with all the talent involved.",Hold the Dark

""Hold The Dark"" is a pitch black, violent, existential drama where ambiguity is legion and human nature is primal. It's a well crafted film, bringing allegory directly to the fore. However, with a plot that is obfuscating the film buckles a little under the director's ambition. Its value can be derived by those who listen and watch carefully and account for its many themes.

27,arungeorge13,Warning: Your level of amusement depends on your exposure to the source material! [+51%],5,29 August 2020,"As someone who enjoyed director Saulnier's previous works, Hold The Dark was a letdown. It's a possibility that I didn't enjoy the film as much because the screenplay wasn't written by Saulnier but by his longtime collaborator (and actor) Macon Blair. Tonally, it felt all over the place. There are elements of crime, action, and drama with shades of folk horror. As opposed to Saulnier's previous flicks, the stylistic elements are limited to the icy Alaskan landscape, a lengthy and well-crafted shootout sequence, and a couple of creepy, ritualistic wolf masks.This is a film that benefits hugely if the viewer has already been exposed to the source material (William Giraldi's book of the same name). If you're watching the film as an uninformed viewer (like I did), there's a good chance that its wolfy metaphors or its incestuous subplot or its vague ending will not leave you flushed. By the time the credits start rolling, one gets the feeling that Hold the Dark was all about big ideas that struggled to strike a chord. The ambiguity behind the killings that take place in the film is mentioned in an exchange between the protagonist and another character - they're bound not to fit into the experience of others (but this is too much, no?).I should have read up a little on Inuit mythology prior to seeing the film and maybe, just maybe, it all would have made slightly more sense to me. Right now, Hold The Dark feels like an incoherent mess in my head. I guess I'll simply wait for a more straightforward thriller from Jeremy Saulnier (that's written by him).",Hold the Dark

I literally had to look up a breakdown of the film because I had no idea where I missed the point of the film.The only reasons I am giving this 4 stars are due to how well it was filmed, it was well acted and the fact that I was interested enough to keep hanging in there waiting for the big reveal.

It may lead him to harm.This spellbinding and unconventional thriller takes unexpected twists and combines myth with crime noir and the outdoors. Perfectly cast, Hold the Dark is visceral, delightfully raw and enthralling.

She had a good character to work with but her performance was too over the place and constructed. You could truly see her acting wheels turning. Usually a good actress, here she was not too good.
The true star of the film is the fantastic cinematography and a adequate score. The problem the film had was the screenplay. It had a great story and a great start but then it lost steam when the film concentrated too much on its violence and graphics.

It focuses more on developing tension and atmosphere than plot. This obviously causes a problem, in which setting and tone contradict plot and characters. Basically, screenplay which is adapted from W. Giraldi's novel (of the same name) does not provide enough emotional ground. It is a slightly overlong movie, which have an ending that isn't satisfying and which does not delve much into characters thoughts, so we come to care less about its story as it solemnly trudges toward its expected finale.

54,TuesdayThe17th,Like a grim and relentless fairy tale,10,2 April 2020,"This is another very good movie from Jeremy Saulnier, director of ""Blue Ruin"" and possibly my all time favorite thriller/horror, ""Green Room"". I am very appreciative of modern horror movies but I do still like the old ones. I have over 3000 horror/thrillers on dvd and blu ray and about 85% of them are from the year 2000 and later. This gives an idea of the depth of appreciation I have and the wide variety i have seen on film. There is a certain intensity in the violence that Saulnier brings to the screen that is like no other. ""Blue Ruin"", ""Green Room"", and ""Hold the Dark"" all have extreme violence in very realistic ways. All three exhibit thoroughly intense headshots. I can always see how stuff is done in movies but the work of Saulnier takes the cake in that there is some violence that looks too real to be faked lol. ""Hold the Dark"" is gritty, dark, scary, and highly entertaining. Jefferey Wright commands the screen in somewhat of a breakout performance. The run time is long and the movie moves along at a slow pace but there is enough intrigue and mystery to keep you engrossed through out. Just when it may seem to get boring, we are treated with an exceptional series of events or a jaw dropping kill scene. The kill scenes are displaced perfectly and they are all very effective. Macon Blair is obviously in this as he is close with Saulnier and his kill scene is scary and realistic. Alexander Skarsgard plays a very scary character and it was nice to see him in a role like this again because ever since ""True Blood"" his characters have been far from intimidating. Between ""Hold the Dark"" and ""The Kill Team"", he has been rejuvenated as a true villain and a force to be reckoned with. I loved the direction in ""Hold the Dark"" as only a third way through it seems like all that can be done has been done, but then it is followed by an explosive second act that ends in one of the best shoot out scenes ever put to film. Knowing of Saulnier's humble beginnings gives me assurance that I too can make it in the industry.

For me, this is a bad thing in a movie, if the viewer has to go and read in other places what was going on and what wasn't told in the movie from the original story, this is a bad a adaptation. It's not that there was thought to give to the movie, it's justs facts that are not told, and you can only guess watching the movie, if you're really atentive to detail.

She asks him to travel to the rural village where she lives to find and kill the wolves who killed the children, because apparently he wrote a story about doing something similar in the past. For reasons never explained, he just goes ahead and hikes on out to her remote village, even though the first thing he tells her is that wolves aren't evil and he won't commit to killing them.During his visit he uncovers some tragic events and reports them to the police. Then as he is about to leave, the ladies husband, a soldier, returns from his military service and loses his mind. He and his friends set about slaughtering half of Alaska for reasons that, to put it charitably, are not very well defined. A good portion of the movie is just watching the soldier/husband and his friend move from place to place killing anything that moves.Little if any of the ""mysterious"" stuff introduced in various odd conversations is ever explained, the dialogue is awful, and good god there's way too many people silently staring into the camera.

58,Come-and-Review,An atmospheric success that is far from perfect,6,28 September 2018,"I can't clearly determine what ""Hold the dark"" is: a sophisticated film that seems mindless or a mindless thriller that seems sophisticated. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable view.Hold the dark is complex: partly a thriller, partly a mystery film, partly a crime film. 
It reminds me of many films and tv shows: Prisoners, No Country for Old Men, The Grey, Twin Peaks and True Detective. Visually, Hold the dark is one of those films that I wish I could see on a big screen rather than online. It's photography and alaskan scenery are often gorgeous.
Generally, from a technical point of view, including in terms of acting, it is outstanding.It is an atmospheric success: the eerie, dark theme of the film is almost palpable.
There isn't any unnecessary dialogue and silence is overall well handled.
It is a film filled with rural mysticism, a very peculiar subject, which often leads to such utterly irrational events that sometimes seem blatantly stupid. 
This often made me question whether it's because of the director's style (I haven't seen other movies from Saulnier), because I missed something, because of the mystic subtheme or because the plot is simply at times stupid. I myself don't like the term 'poor writing' used in many reviews, but while watching ""Hold the dark"" the thought often popped to my mind. There are several scenes of violence, changes of heart, actions that character do that seem nonsensical. The worst part is that probably they were intented to be so 'mindless', but the film seemed to lack something that confirms this. This aspect is what provides the mixed feelings I'm trying to express.I can't resolutely give a high rating to this movie.

For instance, the entire plot has a lot of potential, and in many ways that potential is reached. ""Hold the Dark""'s main star Jeremy Wright should also be noted for his low-key, but highly talented, performance in a film that struggles with any of the characters leaving a lasting impression at all. And when talking about impressions, I get the feeling that Saulnier had a vision very different from writer Macon Blair. While the plot is solid, with occasional actions scenes (such as the dragged out shootout), the gloomy, desolate visual esthetics overrides this in combination with unnecessary silent scenes that gives me the sense that Saulnier desires deeper meanings in the movie and vivid reflections from its audience. Apart from a twist towards the end, ""Hold the Dark"" feels nothing but shallow and with so much potential - from both cast and story - it is a shame it didn't hit the mark.",Hold the Dark

Many will be compelled by the shock and abruptness of some scenes even if they didn't care for or understand the film. But for others, the film is powerful & gripping from start to finish. I'm not familiar with Saulnier's work but I will definitely look him up. The story is from a book by William Giraldi that has high-praise. The atmosphere is a character of its own, and the actors are all commendable. Some people think it's about madness but they weren't watching carefully enough, or perhaps they aren't able to interpret the mysticism for lack of belief or familiarity.",Hold the Dark
63,Condemned-Soul,"'Hold the Dark' holds all the right pieces, but drifts away into incoherent ambiguity",6,29 September 2018,"Anyone who caught a glimpse of the trailer would be certain a genre-meshing treat was on the cards, but 'Hold the Dark' fails to fulfil on that eerie expectation by the time the anti-climactic ending happens.The film stars Jeffrey Wright as a retired naturalist and wolf expert lured into an intriguing mystery about the disappearance of a young boy - supposedly taken by wolves. The setting imbues a sense of foreboding, an aesthetic the story deserves, at least initially. But the further into the narrative you go, the more everything blurs. The mystery goes from dark adventure to crime thriller with undertones of supernatural/occult themes that not only don't gel with the outset, but also don't unravel into anything that makes sense. You can tell that 'Hold the Dark' has the right recipe, but the ingredients are all under-cooked, and the result is never as tasty as the trailers promise. The landscapes and visuals are undeniably the film's greatest strength, but there's only so long that the beautifully rendered, ice-cold bleak winter setting can keep you engaged before you need some narrative sustenance to satisfy curiosity. More an art film than an adventure, 'Hold the Dark' has a couple of lively sequences courtesy of bursts of violence that punctuate the monotonous pace, but because the plot isn't as tantalising as it should be, just like the setting, it feels rather empty before proceedings slow down again. The final impression is something you realise sustained your curiosity, attempted to test intellect, but failed to conclude events properly; ultimately leaving you baffled and disappointed.6/10",Hold the Dark
64,nebk,Terrific,8,28 September 2018,Hold The Dark is a highly atmospheric and gritty mystery thriller in which a wolf expert and author called Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright) is invited by a grieving mother and goes to Alaska in order to hunt down a wolf that supposedly killed her son. It turns out that there is much more to the story and the plot thickens when the boy is found dead from strangulation and not a wolf attack. The story becomes even more complex with the arrival of the child's father Vernon Slone (Alexander Skarsgard) who is determined to avenge his son and will eliminate anyone standing in his way. The acting was top notch from the main cast as well as the supporting actors. The cinematography was beautiful with some breathtaking shots of Alaska. Even though the pace was slow at times the twists in the story are unexpected and very brutal and even more effective because of the sudden way that they occur. Certain elements of the film border on the mystical though and there are some aspects of the movie that remain unexplained and as such may not appeal to anyone looking for a neat Hollywood ending. Overall a great film though and worth a watch if one is willing to pay attention to the dialogue and storyline.,Hold the Dark
65,Craig_McPherson,Something incomprehensible this way comes,5,1 October 2018,"I've never been overly fond of ""art house"" movies. I've watched more than my fair share and while I ardently admire certain such qualities in commercial films, particularly in areas such as cinematography and atmosphere, other attributes tend not to blend as well with mass market fare.Such is the case with Netflix's Hold the Dark, the adaptation of William Giraldi's novel of the same title.Atmosphere and beautiful cinematography are two of this film's strong points, however Director Jeremy Saulnier and screenwriter Macon Blair's approach to the murder mystery narrative leaves a lot to be desired. In this regard their artsy approach of ""let's leave things open to audience interpretation"" completely undermines what should have been a crackerjack entry in the mystery genre.
Using the magnificent scenery of Alaska as a backdrop, it tells a completely disjointed story of a wildlife naturalist and author (Jeffrey Wright of Westworld and Casino Royale fame) who responds to a written request from a woman in a remote village whose son was the most recent of three children carried away by a pack of wolves to track down and kill the pack.From there the film sidetracks to Iraq, and then back to Alaska. I won't give too much away, suffice to say up to this point things fairly make sense. It's only when the woman's husband returns home from his deployment that things go squirrely and fast.Suffice to say that the wolf hunt is jettisoned in favor of a more intriguing premise, but that, in turn is sabotaged by a several WTF moments in the script. After viewing I had no problem inserting various interpretations for events, and the motivations of key characters, but it left me feeling the screenwriter and director were just being lazy and letting the viewer do their job, rather than tell a sound story. If I wanted mysticism I'd read a book by Carlos Castaneda, not turn to Netflix.There's a lot to like here, but in the end you will probably feel like you've been cheated when it counted most. Watch for yourself and decide.",Hold the Dark
66,bushtony,"And, so...what was it about...?",3,1 October 2018,"There are certain attractive and intriguing elements at play here. A bleak, isolated, poverty-stricken community beyond the fringes of civilisation, surrounded by snowy mountains, forests and packs of wolves. Missing children and grieving parents. A psychologically damaged naturalist, writer and wolf expert. A dogged local sheriff. A veteran of the Iraq conflict who is a stone-cold killer of men. His wife who appears to have murdered their son and blamed it on the animals. Native American mythology surrounding wolves and spirits and stuff. Cinematography is good, perfectly capturing and visually depicting a harsh and barren world teetering on the brink of implosion. The atmosphere of doom and foreboding, of barely glimpsed danger on the periphery of vision, is communicated effectively. All in all, a promising set-up. Attractive and intriguing elements at play.It unravels quickly into an incoherent mess, lacking any clarity or indication of what might be going on or why. There are hints of supernatural forces in the story, of shared or inherited psychosis, but the characters and their motivation are never discernible through a chilly morass of mumbled and whispered cryptic dialogue and impenetrable expressionless stares into the void. At time it is slow and ponderous, which wouldn't automatically be such a bad thing, providing the slow burn and the pondering signposted something meaningful, revealed something that triggers understanding. It doesn't.Over half way in there is an action-packed and well-choreographed sequence of mass slaughter, wherein a disaffected and implicated villager unloads on the local police force with a belt-fed machine gun. Why is never really explained. Frustration, boredom, revenge for something, who knows? And am I wrong in thinking that armed police should possess some meagre proficiency with firearms and been trained to use them? Ten or fifteen coppers fail to hit a static man-sized target a few metres away who never changes position. That aside, it's a thrilling ten minutes of mayhem that does liven things up, but nevertheless feels a bit misplaced.Perhaps the underpinning concept was to make a movie that was deliberately inexplicable, that old chestnut of leaving it up to the viewer to reach their own conclusions as to what was going on or why and what it all means in the end. Ambiguity, hints, clues and cues can work well when utilised by skilled craftsmen - Kubrick's ""The Shining,"" for instance springs to mind. It can be entertaining and fun. But the bulk of this offering is murky, indistinct and fatally flawed in a narrative sense. And in the end frustrates and alienates.Maybe the makers will one day provide some pointers on the subject, to help out middling dullards like me.

This movie is like spending hours aligning dominoes but never bothering to push them over. There is strong background story building but it never leads into the explanation for the plot.This movie is about a mother and a father who are actually sister and brother. That much the film does make clear. Why did the mother kill her child? No one ever knows. Why do they walk around wearing masks? No one ever explains. What's with burying the child in the ice and then unearthing him? Why is the Solder's Native friend gunning down police with an M60? We get it they didn't do much to find your lost child and it made you despise the police but really? Why did the boys father feel the need to kill everyone he came in contact with but let the hunter live? There's not much explanation of anything in this film so take what you will of it. What I gathered is that the Mother was ashamed of their incest child and her relationship with her brother so she killed him and ran away from her life. The Father learns about his sons death after returning home and sets out to find his wife. He blames the old woman for not stopping his wife from killing their son since she knows how uneasy the mother was about their incestuous relationship. So he kills her and then he sets out to find his Wife and kills anyone that can tell his whereabouts. He finds his Wife at the place they made love together and he tries to kill her but he loves her too much to do so. Instead they kiss and make up and head off to live their lives. The hunter is a witness to their story as that is his only role to survive and tell their story as he says that was the reason he was summoned there to tell the mothers story. They ""spared"" him just so he could do just that. WHY? is telling their story so important? Who knows. There is a scene where the hunter is in a hut being treated of his wounds and see's a woman that is out of place and it is of course the mother of the incestuous couple. Ok... but why? She adds nothing to the story.If it weren't for the Polaroid photos of them as kids, the mother saying she always knew her husband and the old guy saying that there was a woman there that looked just like him than you'd never really put 2 and 2 together.I guess for a movie where so many people die in such violent and brutal ways you just want it to make sense other than the Mother and Father are sociopaths with no emotions except for each other.",Hold the Dark

While it had some very well Executed shot composition and nature settings, it's bogged down by an extremely dull slow moving plot that isn't very substantial. Jeremy Saulnier really showed immense promise with Blue Ruin's brutally intense thriller, but has now missed the mark imo with the mediocre green room and now hold the dark.

73,boris_unanimate,Hold Your Breath,7,1 October 2018,"Let's not get ahead of ourselves, shall we? For some time, I have been watching movies mostly based on the screenwriter and director, which often proves to be a good choice when it comes to accomplished screenwriters and directors. It helps you follow your favorite moviemakers based on your favorite style and type of movie. Jeremy Saulnier and Macon Blair are responsible for some of my favorite unusual movies, like Blue Ruin, Green Room, I Don't Feel At Home In This World Anymore and Murder Party. These are not your regular movies, with Hollywood-y stories that appeal to the masses; these are movies that resemble real life and real consequences. 
I Watched Hold the Dark on Netflix, and I felt like the movie took its time to get going, which is a Blair trait like no other. You really get to feel the atmosphere and what this is about, instead of watching high-paced action and thrilling stories. This is how art imitates life - slowly finding its target and then drilling into its flesh, until you feel sick and disgusted by it. Rarely will you watch a Saulnier movie and feel great afterwards. This is not a movie for cinephiles that seek great cinematography or impactful plots; this is for people who enjoy a good movie that gives you a taste of reality... without holding back.
In the end, most Saulnier and Blair movies end on a positive note, with a spark of hope. It is never as dark as it actually would be in real life, but it is far from the Hollywood dreams the industry wants to sell. I rather watch this type of movie than fake fantasies.

I am someone who reads a ton, so I will always defend films based on books, but when you make a film, it should to an extent stand on its own. If I NEED to read the book to understand the film? That's bad film making imo.It's beautifully shot, it's very well acted, I loved the lead wolf hunter guy...but it was just too...goofy. It was strange, not in a great, ""Jacobs Ladder/Requiem for a dream"" strange ...just...it felt nonsensical.The hunter has no idea of the boys name, appearance or anything to even know if he's found him. The Dad murders (although deserved) a fellow soldier and just walks away, the mom appears to be absolute bananas, with no job or help, yet seems to support herself just fine by being ...crazy I guess...? and nothing ever comes of it, and we have people I guess turning into wolves. Keep in mind the movie is played VERY straight, it's not meant to be humorous or a horror film at all.The closest thing it resembles is a weird dream you could have, but not in a good way....just in the way that many dreams just make no sense ...I also could be slightly bitter because going in, a review site said ""if you love werewolf movies, check it out.""

79,CelluloidDog,The Dark Already Came,6,29 November 2018,"A novel turned movie where unfortunately both fall short. I didn't read the novel but watched the film. And then I read background on the novel and reviews. So I actually got a very good grasp of the plot (which confused most people). Overall, it falls tantalizingly short of a dark, gothic thriller but somewhere in the realm of psycho-thrillers that lack soul. It's a beautifully filmed film in the cold wilderness of Alaska with fairly good acting. But it really falls short after that. The main criticism of viewers is the unclear plot. Director Jeremy Saulnier does a stylist job but one that has too many holes. He later explains he intentionally left a few holes in the boat but on the other hand, you don't want the boat to sink. And it does sink a bit in this case. Jeffrey Wright does much of the superb acting but most of the rest of the acting is limited and somber. Julian Black Antelope plays Cheeon in a dramatic mid-point standoff but aside from that, it's plain. One can explain the dark secrets of the couple (Medora and Vernon) but in the whole context of the film, many things don't make much sense. Why does Cheeon go on the spree? What's the sense of first two cops getting killed? So if secrets are to be kept, why go to extremes? It's not the irrationality or dark side of human nature that needs to be coherent but rather what path the director wants to take. There are similar such movies that take a more coherent path. This one walks in mud, not even snow. The final unclear secret, why drag the body at the end? What purpose does that serve? The wolves live more coherent sensible lives, so the comparison of wolves and human isn't quite valid for this film. That theme supposedly keeps the film (and book) together but it fails. It's a fascinating analogy but its comparing apples and oranges in particular, when your humans don't really act like wolves. So this film claims to make sense if one has insight from the novel but neither actually make much sense. On another note, the novel received good but not great reviews from readers. Critics liked the book and movie more than readers or filmgoers. That says the critics were probably off the mark. Or both book and movie critics were in an obfuscated dimension. One has to question whether the author (William Giraldi) or director really understood what they were doing. It's stylish and Wright does a fine acting lead but the rest of the film is a cold Alaskan mountain fog.",Hold the Dark

In HOLD THE DARK, Netflix takes its big budget and films a story set in Alaska (although it was filmed in Canada), and successfully shows us the cold, unforgiving, man vs. Nature landscape. That's where the good elements of the movie end.Fans of 21st century James Bond movies will recognize an older Felix character, played by actor Jeffrey Wright, as an author who wrote about wolves. He is asked to come to Alaska to help a grieving mother hunt down the wolves who supposedly took her young son from her.Once this initial storyline is established, the movie seems to run on endless tangents, from a wounded war veteran who comes home to Alaska, to the search for the grieving mother who, as it turns out, has her son's body buried in her house, to the demented friend of the same woman's husband, who feels it necessary to open fire with a machine gun on to police officers who came to talk to him, to the author's encounter with wolves in the wild, etc. Etc.These tangents are unable to keep the story cohesive, and leave the audience wondering what they just watched.",Hold the Dark

The writers left it open for interpretation even though they hinted at the overall theme. They were evil shrouded in darkness from when they were young. That was hinted at all through the movie. The dad look for ""wolves all"" to heal him because he was sick and ""unnatural"". The unknown is shrouded in the native legends in that area of Alaska. If you paid attention to the Iraq moments you could tell he was unnaturally emotionless toward killing. First his buddy on the road said he was a ""meat eater"" and then killing the US soldier that was raping that woman. No emotion. The wife was pissed he ""left"" and killing the kid would bring him back in her mind and it did. Were they always like this? We're they wolves or shapeshifters? Again, interpretation. Remeber the old man said they looked Nordic so, could they be some kind of wolf gods or something? Interpretation. At the end the tribal kid said ""they spared you"". Someone asked why they took his boots and that was simple. The tribe knew about those two and she took the boots to give them back. Remeber they were the fathers boots. He was spared to tell the story, the whole reason she brought him there. It was a little frustrating to not give a bit more in areas, like what was the wolf legends in the area?

He goes, she comes (on)--cue the fast-forward button.Soon, Cole (Wright) and the police chief Marium (James Dale Badge, whom I know from the superb 2010 mini-series 'Rubicon') are trying to sort out the disappearance of the aforementioned mom, her disaffected husband (furloughed from the armed forces) who starts a muderous spree with the aid of another disaffected guy, a Native who has stockpiled a truly marvelous cache of ammo.

From what I read here at IMDB, we are not heading to a clear conclusion, but I can't give anything away since I have 30 minutes to go as I write this. There are obvious problems with the script: what started as a compelling outdoor scenic hunt-investigation turned into a Pekinpah tribute bloodbath. We don't know why any of the characters behave or react as they do, but, from what I have seen on ALASKA STATE TROOPERS, anyone who tangles with the local authorities soon finds immense heat bearing down.

Indigenous twist & theme.Hubby and wifey are Nordic looking human wolves as in Indigenous lore (play on local white wolves). Wolf hunter comes out to find them, he does. Hubby and his bud (not wifey, Indigenous bud), kill almost every cop within a 100 miles plus a few others for good measure. Wifey after killing their son flees, actually playing hard to get, but hubby finds her and wolf hunter them. Naturally he gets arrow shot but survives because he spared real wolves earlier in the show; hence, the human wolves return the favor. That's because they were ""savaging"" like the real wolves did a cub in the show because they were stressed (understatement of the decade w.r.t. the human wolves).Indigenous snow mobilers find our wounded wolf hunter and say he was spared.Circle closed.I liked the scenery in this Nordic Noir, sorry, Alaskan Indigenous Noir movie...too bad you could not make out much of it for the ""noir"".Different, off the wall is why I kept watching and I liked it.",Hold the Dark

100,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,Holds your patience in the Dark,7,19 September 2018,"The basic premise of Jeremy Saulnier's adaptation of Hold the Dark takes place in Alaska where wolf expert Russell Core has arrived to investigate the disappearance of a child claimed by his mother to have been taken from the very animal Core studies. From there Core discovers that the wolves may be the least of his concern. The film is interesting through its dark atmospheric tone and gorgeous yet haunting cinematography of the wild landscape. As with any other of his, the violence is very sudden and brutal. It sneaks up behind you and leaves you in gasp from the site of it. While the body count is way higher and on a much bigger canvas, it lacks the self-contained momentum of Green Room and Blue Ruin. The pacing felt very inconsistent at times especially as it seems it never quiet matches the shocking shootout scene that happens in the middle act. Both Jeffrey Wright and Alexander Skarsgard get to show great character work in their performances. Wright shows Core as a man whom is sympathetic towards wolves as he sees their behaviour isn't intentionally evil but is disturbed and often times terrified of what horrifying acts human beings themselves do throughout the story. And Skarsgard as the missing boy's veteran father Vernon brings an intensity and intimidating presence while still conveying there is still a little bit of humanity left in him to understand his motivations. While the characters are certainly compelling, the vaguely defined supernatural element makes the story's direction feel too plot heavy and less compelling. The story is very much an exploration of how human behaviour can be more vicious then nature itself. While the conclusion makes sense thematically, it can feel anti-climatic depending on how much you are invested in the themes.Hold the Dark I wouldn't call a disappointment but does not live up to the quality of his past films.

Also why the need to kill all those people if he just wanted to hook up with her in the cave, he knew where she was so why even go to the mine as if he was looking for her. Also that cop, yeah the one that got all those other cops killed and then himself. The guy with the 50 cal, first the cop had ample opportunity to take him out when talking to him at the door but no, he tells him all the other cops are green and he'll go easy on him ect, this is a guy that has already been involved in the execution of two cops, nonsense. Then the other cops hide behind car doors when been shot at with armored piercing rounds, come on. There was a lot of foolish carry on going on, things that in reality would never happen.

The grizzled writer is pretty likable and I found myself rooting for him, but the rest of the characters were just weird or caricatures instead of fleshed out characters. 
It had a sort of X Files feel at first which drew me in, but left me wanting. I was hoping the kids were stolen by wolves because the wolves were skinwalkers or shapeshifters or something, but it's never more than hinted at.

107,markkbranson,"Watch, Read Comments, Watch Again, then Decide",9,11 February 2019,"I am sorry fo the long and, perhaps, confusing title of this commentary on ""Hold the Dark"" (2018). I title this piece in this manner because of my response to this film: it is compelling, confusing, and extremely cinematic. Allow me a chance to explain these three responses.Compelling: the piece is compelling on lots of fronts. The story is intriquing where a child is disappeared in the Alaskan wilds and the distraught mom calls a world expert to exact her revenge. The story is also compelling because it can be seen as a ""neo-Western,"" e.g. conflict between civilization and the frontier. And this movie plays wonderfully as straight mythos: male & female caught in an eternal conflict of life, death, rebirth. Each of these stories play well and compelled me to watch this twice (as stated in the title).Confusing: the confusion comes from several aspects of this film. First that comes to mind is motivation: why do things happen the way they do (of course, a mythological approach does not worry about this question). What the hell does the referense to the ""sky"" mean? How do I respond to Alexander Skarsgård's character--do I like him, hate him, pity him, cheer for him, hope for him? And the same is true about Jeffrey Wright. I am pleased by the last scene of reconciliation and by the promise of know all, yet this image is dashed with the cut to the end title. Each of these questions compelled me to watch this film twice (as stated in the title).Cinematic: nature in the Alaskan wilderness is nearly a character here and certainly is cinematic at the hands of the director, Jeremy Saulnier. Consider the contrasts of black, white and shades of grades, particular on the flight looking fot the missing mother (Riley Keough.) The threat of THE dark (I used this signifier purposefully) is always near by and reinforced with low key lighting, as well as the actions of the characters. This image is reinforced cinematically with the brief interlude in the Middle East where Skarsgard is stationed after leaving wife and son. Even here, the darkness is present though the skyies are blindingly bright (not how one solider comments that Skarsgard is a ""meat-eater."") This cinematic tour de force complled me to watch the film a second time.Bottom line: do what my title suggests: watch, read, watch a second time (I am plannin on my third some time this week) and then decide what you want about this film. I am unfamilier with Saulnier's work, but this film certainly compels me to add him to my watch list, too!",Hold the Dark

Go read those.But if this movie is in fact to be taken as an allegory, then really none of the involvement of any outsiders is necessary.Why call in Jeffrey Wright's wolf expert? And coming to be the focus of a police manhunt is a stupid move. The male & female antagonists (in whichever description you wish to give them) could have just completed their objective without killing anyone else, except perhaps some of the indigenous characters who were privy to and/or influencing the activity.The center piece of an armed standoff is spectacular, but pointless to the end result.

This story is so shockingly badly told that it required people who've read the book writing reviews on here to explain what was supposed to be happening in the film. Check out the first few (most rated) reviews here if you don't believe me.Worse, even those people who've read the book are forced to admit that the film just skipped over major plot points and characters. Other plot points are presented in such obtuse and indirect fashion as to only be intelligible if you already know the story.All of which leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the people who made this film don't even have a basic grasp of storytelling, like listening to a toddler try to tell a long, complex story, but they keep leaving out important events, characters, and connections.Can you call it good acting when whatever the actor is trying to convey is entirely unintelligible? You could tell me they absolutely nailed it, and all I could do is shrug and say, ""If you say so."" You could likewise tell me they got it completely wrong, didn't portray a single emotion realistically, and I'd still have to shrug. When the plot and motives are unintelligible, the acting can't possibly make sense.As for the ""tone"" some people are praising, they could have played the Hamster Dance through the entire film and it would have fit with the unintelligible story exactly as perfectly. As with the acting, if your storytelling is not making sense, other elements can't possibly be in sync with a nonexistent theme.This film is painfully paced, utterly boring, completely lacking an ending, and so badly told that it literally doesn't make sense on its face.

115,grantbullert,"Beautiful, but Empty",7,6 January 2019,"""Hold the Dark"" is a slow film with excellent moments, but a few too many questions are left unanswered.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The script is the biggest issue with this film. There seems to be a lack of direction throughout the film, and we are not given enough information about many things. Because of this, we don't care as much about the thing we should care more about. The direction of Jeremy Saulnier is decent. He gets good performances out of his actors, but spends too much time trying to be mysterious instead of just presenting a story. *Editing/Cinematography: The film editing is decent. It doesn't draw much attention to itself, but it is also very formulaic feeling. The work of cinematographer Magnus Nordenhof Jønck is beautiful, but it is a pity he did not have more of a coherent story to work with. But he deserves congratulations on his stunning work, which occasionally distracted me from how lackluster the script was. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is average. It feels real enough but never draws us further into the story. The acting is wonderful, for the most part. Jeffrey Wright gives a strong performance, as well as Alexander Skarsgård. Together, they carry this film through. But James Badge Dale gave a strong performance as well. *Music/Sound: These two categories are fairly unnoticeable. They did their part, nothing more, nothing less. *Production Design/Special Effects: The film feels quite real thanks to these two categories. The costume and sets are well executed. The special effects are fairly grounded and do not step over their bounds.*Conclusion: ""Hold the Dark"" is a well made film in terms of production value.

128,parkerrodney,"Love it or hate it, but don't attack either side",6,30 December 2018,"Hold the DarkWhenever a review is titled ""Don't listen to the bad Reviews"" I immediately seek out the two things, the bad reviews and the flawed logic and reasoning in the review entitled, ""don't listen to the bad Reviews.""People say, if you don't understand the movie or the ending, read the book. Gee, I thought the whole purpose of a movie was minimally to produce a coherent story from beginning to end. People say don't listen to the bad reviews. The words used to describe this movie run the gamut from amazing, beautifully done, to stinker, terrible waste of time. Moreover, the ratings range from 1 star to 10 stars. I try not to read reviews before I write mine as not to be influenced. I will state however, that after an hour into the movie, I had reached the conclusion that Hold the Dark, though gripping, was not to be one of my favorites, nor was it one of my least favorites. The story line was fine though unnecessarily evasive and tedious. The subject matter darker than I typically like, and I found the violence excessive and gratuitous, all of which led to a slow, and at times, a painfully slow movie. These are facts to which real metrics can be aligned.But, favorite or not, what was sad were the condescending remarks of pity and contempt by those who felt the movie was a ten. These reviews, 28 of the 588 reviews conducted, placed the film on a cinematic pedestal, and then in some instances proceeded to make unknowable claims about viewers that didn't agree with their 10 assessment. Further, they made spurious and obnoxious claims about the intellect, rather than the content, of those reviews that did not align with their minority assessment.Hmm, curious I thought. A movie review is an argument therefore it must adhere to the rules of an argument. In making an argument, when you attack a person or a group of people and not their arguments, you're generally losing the argument. There are far too many comments that attack the reviewer and in doing so fail to negate the claims of others who rate the movie less than a ten. The reviews below 7 are legitimate and cannot be discounted. Incidentally, these reviews do not attack the intellect of the reviewer who rated the movie a ten, because they do not have to, the film was rated as 1 star by 198 reviewers. If 7 stars is a passing grade, then only about 140 reviews gave it a passing grade.Hold the Dark is not the worst movie in the world, but it ain't Pulp Fiction either. In making a movie in Alaska with wolves and an indigenous culture, the movie starts from a place of scenic beauty which you almost can't screw up.Bottom line, you're either gonna like this movie or not. It's clearly not for everyone, but don't buy into the logical fallacy that ""it went over peoples head,"" or that some people don't have the intellect to even know what a good film is. Enjoy it or not, just be clear about why you do either. Form your own opinion, and don't listen to bad arguments. There are over 330 forms of flawed logic.

131,julesfdelorme,"The Best Movie that you won't like, or understand...",10,24 October 2018,"Hold The DarkI'm going to recommend a film to you that you will not enjoy, that you probably won't understand, at least not completely, and yet which you should definitely watch if you are a fan of great film.And Hold The Dark is a great film. In my opinion a truly great film.Starring Jeffrey Wright, one of those superb actors whose name you probably can never remember, if you ever knew it in the first place, who has a habit of being in very good and often great work, Alexander Skarsgard, the only acting Skarsgard who is generally not known for great work, generally he's just a pretty face and muscular body, but he gives one of his finest performances here, nuanced and understated (It almost makes up for Tarzan), James Badge Dale, whose career in television mirrors Wright's on a smaller scale, and Riley Keough, who I've never heard of before this, but if she pursues more work like this I feel we shall come to know as a very serious and very gifted actor. Directed by Jeremy Saulnier, who gave us equally wonderful, exasperating and difficult films with Blue Ruin and Green Room (If you haven't seen either of those films, I would highly recommend you do, for the same reasons as I do Hold The Dark), based on the book by William Giraldi (Which I now absolutely have to read.), Hold The Dark is one of those rare films that does not pander in any way and assumes that your smart enough to keep up.I have now watched Hold The Dark twice. Because it was so good and because I had to watch it a second type just to make a little more sense of it.Hold The Dark challenged me. And I am a long way from stupid or lazy.On the surface of it, Hold The Dark, may not appear to be Film Noir, but it definitely is, in the very best sense of the genre. It is a film that aims very high. It holds up as it's model films like Chinatown, The Big Sleep and Blade Runner, and it comes very close to it's mark.Like the afore mentioned films, Hold The Dark, does not try to impress us right away. It is the kind of film that truly resonates and haunts. You may not like it right away. You may not get it right away.But you will remember Hold The Dark.This film is dark. It is almost unspeakably violent. It is confounding and more than a little difficult to watch.It is also hauntingly beautiful and deeply meaningful, more like a painting or a poem than like a movie.It uses it's Alaskan setting to mirror the starkness and unspeakable mystery of it's story about lost children, wolves and wounds that never quite heal. It walks on that razors edge between reality and myth with such wondrous balance that you are never quite sure which is which, or for that matter, it there is actually a difference.Hold The Dark is quite simply the best film that you almost certainly will not enjoy or completely understand.It is not entertainment.It never allows itself to be something as trivial as entertainment.If that's what you're looking for, if that's all your looking for, stay away from Hold The Dark.But if you're looking for something more, something that moves you in ways that you won't, can't and perhaps shouldn't completely understand, then find this film on Netflix.Watch it.Watch it more than once.
Let it seep into your unconscious the way you would a great painting or a great poem.You may not end up agreeing with me that this is a truly great film.But ask yourself this when your finished watching this film:Can you get it out of your head?Can you forget Hold The Dark?Or does it haunt you in ways that you cannot fully encapsulate in mere words?And does that not define it as some kind of art?You almost certainly will not enjoy Hold The Dark?You probably won't be able to understand it completely.But that does not in any way diminish it's horrible beauty.And that does not in any way mean that you should deny yourself the experience of having watched Hold The Dark.This may seem like I'm damning this film with faint praise.But that is not at all my intention.My intention is the praise Hold The Dark.As one hell of damned good film.In every sense and meaning of that phrase.",Hold the Dark
132,martinlucas-469-207968,What a shame,3,2 October 2018,"In line with most comments that appear on the internet lately, viewers' reviews of films, particularly Netflix offerings, seem to alternate between ecstasy and crushing rejection. Reviewers often seem to confuse their personal response with an objective assessment.

""So, trying to be a bit more balanced.. I loved Blue Ruin and Green Room but am disappointed with this one. It's apparently based on a book but the various shocks and incomprehensible actions feel more like they were dreamed up by the writers just to keep us involved.

Many of scenes were so dark you couldn't see anything. Conversations were so cryptic I was wondering whether subtitles might help. All of this led to a complete lack of interest in the bloodbath. Basically Alexander Skarsgard killed people, end of movie. To be fair, there are one or two nice shots of wolves and a lovely shot of some snow covered mountains for a brief moment.

He's solidified himself as one of my favorite directors due to how absolutely solid his last two films were, they're among my favorite films of all time. If you enjoy Jeremy's directing, you'll definitely enjoy this film as well. Jeremy's strengths are at their strongest here. Unrelenting, Unexpected and unforgiving violence. Breathtaking cinematography. Nerve wracking suspense, and his ability to completely subvert expectations are all extremely present and shining. Him and Macon Blair's ""less is more"" writing works great with the dark and dreadful atmosphere surrounding the film. I wholeheartedly disagree that the film was slow in any way. Although the pacing is occasionally inconsistent, I was never once bored and constantly within Saulnier's grip through each and every scene. Personally, my only real issue is that ""less is more"" seems to be a tactic also applied to the story itself, creating more questions than answers and leading to a conclusion that wasn't quite as satisfying as it probably needed to be.

144,nadblaster,Kinda like Alien III but in Alaska,6,2 October 2018,"This movie is dense, unintelligible, takes itself way too seriously and ultimately tells a story that eventually leaves you scratching your head. At first viewing, I saw a pretentious, opaque movie the likes of which I haven't seen since the old CBC broadcasts of weird foreign films at midnight. After watching it again I started to see things that make sense in the end but you don't notice on your first viewing, and I found myself enjoying it much, much more as a result. Which is exactly how I felt about Alien III - at first blush it's a dumb, self-absorbed vanity piece, and on subsequent viewings you start to ""get it"".Outside of that it's got some excellent production values, some of the best gun-related special effects I've seen in movies, mostly great acting, a really egotistical writer and an otherwise okay movie - the second time around. Your first viewing isn't going to impress you though.",Hold the Dark
145,theroscoevine,I liked it for what it was,6,10 October 2018,"Since some of the people writing the horrible reviews complained about not understanding the movie, I'll give my take. The lead character played by Jeffrey Wright, the naturalist, is tormented by the dark moments of his past. These include estrangement from his daughter and ex-wife. He also had an incident which he wrote about in his book in which he was put in a position where he had to kill a female wolf. He felt bad about that at the time, and I think it had been haunting him and contributing to his difficult history.I think, near the end of the movie, when one of the characters tells him ""they spared you.... they spared you"", it could be assumed that the speaker was referring to the people who had wounded him but did not kill him, choosing instead to leave him for dead, but in reality, I think the speaker was referring to the wolves who were very close by and staring at him laying in the snow bleeding, but they did not attack. The wolves sparing the main character was symbolic of forgiveness and redemption for him in spite of his previous killing of one of theirs. The daughter being reunited with him at the end of the movie was to show that she is able to forgive him, also.I did have some issues with the movie, particularly at the beginning, because I really did not like the acting or speaking tone of both main characters for the first 10 or 15 minutes. Riley Keough and Jeffrey Wright both had dead pan monotones in all their spoken lines, and it just seemed off and weird. It was some very strange characterization, and I did not really understand what the movie was going for with that. It actually seemed quite cheap and amateurish, but I don't expect that from Jeremy Saulnier, whose work I have enjoyed quite a bit, so I didn't know what to make of it. Maybe the subdued tone of the main characters was supposed to emulate the snowy wilderness of the movies setting? I have no idea.Interestingly, I didn't actually realize this was the same director, but I figured it out after I recognized Macon Blair from Blue Ruin, and it especially made a lot of sense once everybody started getting shot. This movie is very bloody and violent in several moments. I really like violent movies, and Saulnier does a great job with them.For what it's worth, Blue Ruin and Green Room were both much more interesting and fun to watch, I still like this one OK. It was not pointless or a waste of time like many have claimed. You have to give it the benefit of the doubt and realize that the movie was telling a story about a lonely man with an unhappy past, being asked, even forced, to revisit some of the ills that had made him the way he was.Special note: I'm super glad I did not watch this movie with my wife, because she would've absolutely hated it.",Hold the Dark
146,opiaterein,"A bleak, unsatisfying, beautiful bloodbath.",8,31 October 2018,"I once saw Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room described as something you should watch knowing as little about it as possible. I would say the same is true of Hold the Dark. (I didn't realize until I was well into writing this review that Hold the Dark is also a Jeremy Saulnier film. This is so hilariously and devastatingly appropriate I actually wasn't surprised at all.) The plot description describing a mother looking for revenge after her son is taken by wolves tells very little of the story, but the rest of the story should unfold before you naturally in all its chilling, terrible glory.Another reviewer said this film has no plot. At the risk of sounding unkind, that person is a moron. Having a simple plot and having no plot are not the same thing.

Saulneir, similar to other creative/innovative directors, ended up creating a slightly above average Netflix film debut. The atmosphere of the film is impressive, Saulneir has always excelled in that department. The rest of the thriller is, well, not thrilling. The different pieces don't come together to create a cohesive whole. There are plenty of obscurities that you get to figure out on your own through close observation.

No dialogue is wasted and just as the audience is piecing together seemingly throw-away lines from earlier with later developments, new plot points emerge.Hold The Dark will not be for everyone, but fans of the duo's preceding projects and those of a mind to reflect during and after the film will find this a rewarding endeavour.",Hold the Dark

Just absolutely sick!,1,19 October 2018,"With Hollywood constantly browbeating us, preaching to us about their ""high standard"" morality, i.e. defending women's equality; preaching against the violation of women; advocating ""no borders, more love"", one should question how such high-browned, moral people could produce such depraved films like this one! But on the contrary: if we only look closely, we can clearly see that what is in the minds and hearts of the movie industry is a pleasure in depravity of every kind. If the movie industry is soooo concerned with creating a better world, why put out trash like this? I thought this would be a movie about rescuing a lost child; instead, it's a movie with no plot - just one montage of bloody, savage violence with no reason but two horribly sick, depraved individuals who get away with it. Justice is never seen by the viewers. But even if we did, the movie would still be a useless, offensive, unworthy piece that should never have seen the light of day.One good thing comes out of seeing this film, for me, anyway.... I got one very strong message from this film: We need to begin holding these film makers, actors and actresses more accountable. We need to research every film before paying to see it. We need to stop supporting the production of movies and television programs of this ilk. Watching them holds no worth to humanity. If Hollywood wants to make a better world, they need to make better movies with less violence, less depravity. It tells a lot about what type of people make films like this; it also tells a lot about people who actually support films like this and enjoy them.

Riley Keough is enchanting and eerie with an air of uncertainty. Skarsgaard puts in a real confident performance maybe the best I've seen from him. 
The movie does a great job in portraying the harshness of the terrain the locals live in without making things seem overly bleak. 
The glory shots of the Calgary mountains and forests throughout are a real treat. This is not a happy movie but it is certainly good.
More of a thriller than a drama in my eyes, unexpected twists here and there and some very violent scenes.
It is a fairly long movie and demands a person's full attention. Not one for light drama movie lovers.
The reasons for me giving it a 7 out of 10 and not higher is due to the feeling of some of the dialogue being a bit unnecessary, 15 to 20 minutes could have been taken out of it no problem. Also some scenes were almost a little too real and dark I had to look away.

His first film ""Murder Party"" is a unique dark comedy that I think really set the tone for his career. He's always made movies that go against convention. Blue Ruin is a revenge film with no catharsis. Green Room is a horror movie where who lives and dies is almost arbitrary, and Hold the Dark is a mystery where the mystery and the resolution is unclear.The movie is stunningly bleak, the performances are all top notch, and there's a midpoint shootout that is harrowing to watch.I guess when it comes down to it, I just don't find the dialogue here very compelling, or any of the characters either.

171,lubegiant,It's like being stranded at a used car lot: a Promise turns to Disappointment in no time,4,14 October 2018,"Amazingly, the blogosphere is abuzz with this film, some of the more inspired critics even have the gall to compare it to ""The Revenant,' and not to the latter's advantage. ""Hold The Dark"" is more sinister, more mysterious, more brutal, say they. The story is way darker, goes the shtick, the characters are better written, more sophisticated and multi-polar than the Iñárritu's carefully thought-out personalities...
Well, let me be the first to say that both movies are pure BS from the story standpoint, but at least ""The Revenant"" offers an exposition, development, high point (culmination), and resolution. Besides, it raises some healthy laughs when a guy with an open fracture on his leg rides a horse. Hard...
""Hold The Dark,"" is pegged a thriller, so it strives to thrill, which it does. Rest assured, you'll encounter some top-tier lunacies that would make you salivate for a grand finale a-la the ""red wedding."" Sadly, the film ends right in the middle of everything when you're just about ready for a bathroom break before the good guys start poking holes in maniacs. The cliffhanger is so shameless that it should've made some of the die-hard netflickers cancel their accounts.

172,leoocampo,A Scenic Trip to I'm Not Sure Where,7,3 November 2018,"Well, shot, and a pleasure to watch. Visually compelling and moving.The action, for what action there is, is gritty with no glamour nor glory, just the unbridaled reality of violence and its results.There are interesting characters and a story that keeps you engaged. You won't figure out the plot 10 minutes in and just feel along for the ride. On the other hand, I don't think I ever figured out the plot at all. I was just left asking ""why"" a lot and finding murky answers if any.At least two of our main characters are not just mysterious, but perplexing. A mother who initially seems to seek vengeance on a wolf for taking her son, but then it seems actually strangled the child herself. A father who is a strange and illogical mix of sociopath and honor-bound hero. A family friend who is helping the father in a Bronson-esk blood-bath of vengeance, the vast majority of the victims of which are actually innocent bystanders who seem only either tangentially-involved or unfortunate enough to be in the way. In most cases, the body-count is made up of people just unlucky enough to be there and for which there seems no clear reason for our character to harm... and yet he does, with neither mercy, nor pity, nor hesitation, nor humanity.At several points, you may find yourself wondering if these characters truly are all human or possibly something ... else. But the story never really takes a supernatural turn, or even strongly implies it... there's just the occasional and very vague suggestions of something that could possibly be monstrous in the literal sense. But it's never confirmed that I could tell, nor even implied really. All we ever get shown or told for sure is the monstrosity of the actions of the characters. Perhaps that's the point? I couldn't tell you.This is a strange story and an even stranger film that dodges between rather than bending across genres. At times, it feels akin to a wild-country film like The Grey. At other times, it's a character-driven drama about grief and loss. Then there's the element that feels very much like a mystery or a thriller as you keep expecting the puzzle pieces to eventually align in some final state that makes it all take a definite shape and form. Then there's the gritty gun play that make it seem to share more soul with Fargo or No Country For Old Men than anything else. Even a moment or two where it's a war film in the Tradition of Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, or Generation Kill. But in the back and between all those moments is always a dark, haunting, but subtle element that bounces back and forth between slasher / serial killer flick (the masks, the murders and their victims, the stalking) and almost-but-not-quite lycanthropy.I have no idea what to make of this film and cannot judge how much I like it very easily as I feel more confused than intrigued, but the experience was enjoyable and it's confusion never becomes outright frustrating even though it also never gives you something ponderous enough quite warrant all the inevitable pondering you're left with by the end. Maybe I'll have a different opinion as this one is allowed time to marinate into my brain a bit more.",Hold the Dark

I like a good thriller, but when a movie leaves you hanging because it didn't give you all of the information, that's

174,mikialama,A key to the head scratcher,7,6 October 2018,"Beautiful scenery, excellent acting, thought-provoking story. However, this film is so wrapped up in itself, it fails to remember it has an audience to satisfy. In performance art films, audience is an integral part of what takes place, and the filmmaker has an obligation to provide the means for authentic interaction. The problem with ""Hold the Dark"" is that it is so obtuse, it frustrates viewers, rather than making a connection. Imho, if the viewer understands the film's central metaphor of humans as wild animals, particularly wolves, most of the confusion evaporates. Certainly the clues are there, but they are buried.
Consider the following and then see if your understanding of the film is re-framed:
The entire film is set in Alaska, a giant metaphor for wilderness and wildness beyond the usual veneer of human civilization. When the writer/wolf expert invited to a tiny Northern Alaska village tells the woman who has invited him there that his daughter is in Anchorage, she tells him ""that's not the real Alaska down there"", implying it's too civilized. The woman is Medora Sloan, whose son has been taken, she says, by wolves. Oddly in her letter invitation, she has told the wolf expert she wants him to find the wolf that took her child, but not to kill it. 
Later, when asked how she met her husband Vernon Sloan, she says she never met him,but that he was just in every memory she has ever had, implying they are from the same clan, family, even perhaps brother and sister and have followed wolf mating practices which can include incest. 
Even later, Medora assumes a wolf identity by donning a wolf mask when she tries to seduce the writer. And she tries to get him to strangle her as a part of foreplay, reminiscent of the biting and violence that accompanies actual wolf mating rituals.
Meanwhile, in Iraq, Vernon dispatches insurgents and friendlies with equal ""cold-bloodedness"", prompting an observer to call him a ""real meat-eater"". (Interesting: Medora, the wife's name, is also the name of a town known as North Dakota's top tourist attraction which was originally founded as a meat-packing plant). And in a flashback, Vernon and son Bailey sit near the meat of a carcass of a freshly killed deer as he asks, ""How did that feel?"" Did that feel good?"" Bailey agrees that it did. 
Eventually, the writer discovers Bailey's body of hidden in the house, dead from strangulation not wolves, and Medora is missing. Not long after that, he has the opportunity to see a wolf pack eating a dead pup, and we learn that's a common occurence when food is short or there is ""something wrong"" with the pups. BIG hint. 
When Vernon comes home from Iraq because the son has died, he is equally ruthless in dispatching anyone he sees as weak or unable to adequately perform their duties-the way a wolf pack will dispatch a sick member.
There is also an exchange in which Vernon visits an Indian hunter who tells him they met when Vernon was a boy and that HIS father had wanted ""wolf's oil"" from the hunter in order to help Vernon who had something about him that was ""unnatural"" and ""not right"", implying something also was wrong with Vernon's son Bailey as well. 
This visit comes just after Sloan has been at a tiny hotel where his wife had stayed two nights before. The proprietor tells him the sheets have not been changed. Vernon enters the room, kneels by the bed, buries his head in the sheets, inhaling Medora's scent deeply with surprising longing rather than sadness or anger.
Vernon also has a bond with a First Nations man who has lost a daughter to wolves...a possible hint that the incest practices of wolf-packs are at work in more families in the village than just that of the Sloans. And, true to pack behavior, the friend chooses pack over non-pack when he goes to extremes to protect and support Vernon as he begins his hunt for Medora.
 In contrast, Vernon kills an old woman who has broken the law of pack-first and she actually whines submissively as he stands over her, ready to strike the fatal blow. 
Things fall into place even more when Vernon, wearing a wolf mask on finding Medora, begins to strangle her-which then turns into making love. 
As for why the two dig up their son's remains and take the body with them? Recall the wolves eating the pups? Yep.
Equipped with some of those insights, one should be able to not just more fully understand the balance of the film but also, hopefully, enjoy it.",Hold the Dark

Second, the movie is slow and wastes long periods going on side tangents that have nothing to do with developing the story line. Which brings us to the plot, or lack of one. We still have no idea why Vern is such a physcopath or why his wife did what she did. I kept hoping this miserable plot would somehow get tied all together in the final scene but that was just as mindless as the rest. She just keeps babbling about the sky.

This was a slow-burn but well worth the wait. I'm not spoiling anything, and having not read the book, see if you're as surprised about the ending as I was.
This movie really has something to say about the frontier of Alaska, and really sets the atmosphere for the seclusion one can feel; how its socioeconomic works, how its climate and time zone makes it so brutal, how beautiful its ecosystem is, how it demands reverence, and the culture of a land that everyone seems to forget about are some of the main themes. If you ever saw Alexander Skarsgård in the 2011 remake of ""Straw Dogs, know how commanding and terrifying he can be on screen; this film only amplified his presence and did so in such a foreboding fashion, and you never see it coming.

Humans consider themselves superior to wolves because humans are not wild and can reason, right? But do wolves instinctively kill for the sake of killing? Or is there a moral code embedded in their nature, unlike ours, but misunderstood, because, after all, they're ""wild""? Or is there some aberration, something in-between, part human, part wolf, something mystical, understood only by the indigenous people of Alaska?This time, I was completely captivated by this film.

Hold the dark is another kind of thriller, set in Alaska and it projects a supernatural feel to it even from the beginning. What kept me glued to the screen was the setting, the score and the potential story that wasn't actually developed in a linear way. Its pace was very polarized as well, fast paced at times, especially during the ""action"" scenes and slow in the development of the main story/mystery involving the child's disappearance. The acting was very good and the script, although lacking a proper closure, had some good moments. I remember some very nice lines and conversations throughout the films, lines that make you think about darkness, loneliness, relationships (there's a kind of twist about the couple as well) and kindred spirits. Cinematography wise, the movie has some very nice shot scenes and good composition especially for a ""tv movie"".

The scenery is stunning and the acting for the most part exemplary. But what made this a standout was the fact that the viewer is constantly wrong-footed. More than once I was left wide-eyed with wonder - I never saw THAT coming. It's also one of the few movies I'll look forward to watching again.

I mean, it's ok to leave out story parts and let the audience fill in the blanks, but you ripped out practically the entire story to the point that the movie no longer has a plot.

If you want dark, disturbing and unsettling, then I highly recommend True Detective Season 1.This film is really three films in one and each part is too weak to justify a hard sell.Part one has you thinking this film is about Wolves and missing children but you will soon discover this is a red herring, and that the wolves inclusion in this film boils down to one scene which is later used as a metaphor to describe why adults kill their young. It is loose at best as a metaphor, at worst, is lazy writing and simply lends itself to the incoherent feel of this film.Part two basically builds up to the mass extermination of the local police department. It is gratuitous for the sake of gratuity. The explanation for this massacre is weak and again, it only adds to the disjointed feeling of the film.Part three is basically the father of the missing boy, hunting down his ""wife"". This ends up being hugely anticlimactic and dissatisfying.I think this film is trying to be way too clever, trying to hit the viewer hard with three separate punches, but each punch is wayward and clumsy.The film did hold my attention as it is fairly original and the scenery is quite captivating, but overall, if you are pushed for time, I would give this a swerve and only watch it if you are having trouble sleeping.The acting by Jeffrey Wright, Alexander Skarsgard, Riley Keogh and James Badge Dale is excellent and the direction is superb.

242,MuckyMuckMan73,An ambiguous murder mystery that won't be for everyone,8,29 September 2018,"Last night's movie viewing was Jeremy Saulnier's latest and highly anticipated film Hold The Dark. Off the back of Blue Ruin and Green Room, Saulnier has garnered himself a reputation as a director to follow. Hold The Dark tells the story about Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright), author of a book about his experience with wolves, who is requested by Medora Sloane, the mother of a boy who was taken by wolves to hunt the wolf that took her son. Straight off the bat things don't seem clear cut. There is a feeling that something sinister is lurking in the background with the help of the brooding film score by Brooke and Will Blair. We are then transported to Iraq and introduced to the father of the boy, soldier Vernon Sloane (Alexander Skarsgård) who is an icy cold killing machine but is injured and returns home upon hearing about his son. As the film progresses it is obvious what we are watching isn't going to be a no-brainer of a film. We have to work things out for ourselves. Clues are given to us and we need to string the clues together to make sense of what we are watching. There is abiguity throughout which won't suit people that need things spelling out to them. Things are said that don't make sense on first viewing so it's a film that deserves repeat viewings which in my opinion is great as I will discover something new on each viewing. I did have a slight niggle with the uneven pacing and the unsatisfying ubrupt ending but as a whole I enjoyed the movie immensely. The performances from Wright and Skarsgård are both excellent and a major highlight of the film as was the incredible cinematography from Jønck. He captured the isolation and beautiful Alaskan scenery perfectly. Saulnier's direction is taut and keeps the narrative moving. The shoot out scene is particularly well handled.

In the end, the twins wander off into the wilderness to live in secret and have another child to start over with. The first son's death is eventually simply accepted and the two move on. The mom provides them supplies. Throughout the movie there are implications about Medora messing with evil and such, and it's primarily because of her relationship with her brother and their child. She was instructed to kill her own child (I think by the wolf killer guy if I remember correctly), and she did. The wolf masks were more like curses in the book.

The plot made no sense, as in character motivation, other than ""psychopaths gonna psychopath"". And the senseless plot took a long time to unroll. And I kind of agree with most of the specific negative points made by a lot of other reviewers on this page. But... I didn't hate it. The atmosphere, acting, cinematography were all on point and it had a strange compelling quality that convinced the viewer -or this one at least- to stay with it to the end. Not Saulnier's best film, despite obviously having a relatively large budget compared to the other two. In fact, his weakest. But not quite as bad as most of the reviews.",Hold the Dark
263,Random3,"The film is more concerned with tone, atmosphere and theme than it is with character or plot.",7,29 September 2018,"I loved Green Room, but this was a very different movie. I don't really know what to make of it, because it is a film that doesn't have much of a plot, has characters that rarely speak, and is quite a slow burn. This is the kind of film that if you half-watch whilst doing something else, you would almost certainly hate it.So the setup for the film doesn't matter really because within the first 20 minutes it has gone off those rails, but the setup is that a woman's child has been taken by wolves (the third child in the town to have gone missing) and so she writes a letter to a wildlife expert and author to come to Alaska and hunt down the wolves that did it. The film takes so many twists and turns very suddenly and abruptly that by the time it ends you kinda forget that this is how it started. The film is more concerned with tone, atmosphere and theme than it is with character or plot.As expected the film is pretty damn violent. Not quite Green Room-level, but when it happens you feel it. It also happens very abruptly and suddenly, with little to no hint that anything is about to happen.Overall the film reminded me of so many other films, but stands on its own as something unlike any of them. It had elements of Wind River, The VVitch, The Grey and Prisoners, but it really is a unique movie. It is somewhere between a 6/10 and a 7/10 for me but it is interesting and unique enough for me to say 7/10 for now. Definitely need to rewatch it.",Hold the Dark

265,lamerok,Solid psychological horror film with excellent acting and cinematography,8,1 October 2018,"I don't quite understand all of the very negative reviews. I had no expectation when I started watching this but I love Jeffrey Wright and Alexander Skarsgard and I like atmospheric movies so I thought I would give it a try and I was not disappointed. Wright and Skarsgard were both great in this film and I thought all of the other actors were top notch and the production values were consistently very high. It was suspenseful throughout and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I gather that the main complaint are: (1) that it was too slow and (2) that the plot did not make sense. Firstly, yes it was slow, but I found it to be deliberately paced and suspenseful and it never lost my interest. I would describe this as a psychological horror film or a thriller. It is definitely a character driven film. If you don't like that sort of thing then this film is probably not for you. Secondly, I thought the plot made about as much sense as any horror film. Some of the main characters do not behave rationally and it is never explained whether they are just crazy or if there is a supernatural explanation. That did not bother me as I am happy to come to my own conclusion. I thought that this film definitely had interesting characters who sometimes behaved in unexpected and ambiguous ways but that there was some internal logic to their behaviour that I felt I could understand. That said, the most compelling elements of this film were the atmosphere and the acting rather than the story.At the end of the day I enjoyed the film and if you like Jeffrey Wright and Alexander Skarsgard you may enjoy this film as well.",Hold the Dark

283,ThatGuyReviews,"Jeremy Saulnier's ""Worst"" is Still Some of the Best",7,27 November 2018,"Hold the Dark is only Jeremy Saulnier's fourth full-length directorial endeavor and continues to prove why his name should be synonymous with mastery of the craft. While this film holds no candle to Green Room or Blue Ruin, I personally believe it manages to surpass Murder Party and still acts as a terrific piece of cinema that is only garnering so much criticism because it does not match the expected standard Saulnier has set for himself.
Hold the Dark, at its core, is an exploration of human nature and our animalistic roots. While more subtle with the taboos it covers than its literary counterpart, the film still tackles moralistic quandaries of our innate senses of right and wrong versus those we have developed as a society. The film is visually stunning, with some great sprawling shots of the Alaskan wilderness that really set up the isolation of the setting. In addition, some shots set in the Middle East are even more striking for their disparate appearance. The acting in this movie, while perhaps too off-putting for some, is another tremendous achievement with Skarsgård and Black Antelope delivering amazing performances as the chilling antagonists. Riley Keough and Jeffrey Wright, while still amazing, seemed slightly less intentionally off-kilter and their characters were surely less well-developed, with certain threads being lost in the fold.
Still, on a technical level, every aspect of this movie was, at least, good. The costumes and set design especially were of note. The film does suffer somewhat for its confusing and sometimes forgetful script. Hold the Dark does not guide you by the hand in trying to piece together the puzzles it has laid out and, at times, this can be a great detriment as it often seems that it was not for lack of understanding, but rather that certain elements were never expanded upon properly. A subplot regarding Core's relationship with his daughter never really comes full circle, nor is it explained what caused the divide. Similarly, the intriguing dynamics of the Sloane family are never really explored, only hinted at. Despite some frustrating aspects such as these, the film still holds up to scrutiny and is perhaps the most beautiful Netflix original released so far. I recommend going in with an open mind and making a decision for yourself on this one, as such a personal movie evokes a very individual response from each viewer.Hold the Dark Letter Grade: B",Hold the Dark

This is not an easy story. The motivations of all (aside from the lead cop) are ONLY hinted at. So you cannot watch this movie without taking EVERYTHING as clues to why. Why the murder? Why the villagers versus the city dwellers and their police? Why the divisions within the village, among those who grew up together? Etc. Every weapon, every photo, every comment speaks to them.Those who want a simple A-to-Z plot with a clear and ""just"" resolution will be understandably disappointed. And I rated it just a 7 myself because, as those who read the book probably know, a few characters are so opaque as to be almost useless without a novel's detail.

311,Polar-Night,"Basically, style over substance.",6,28 September 2018,"Just because one is a fan of the director (Saulnier), or the actors, does not mean that you have to force yourself to like a mediocre movie. There were a lot of people who did not like the novel because of its violence and open ending, but if they would watch the movie, they would have loved the book!
There are so many explanations given in the novel that the violence never feels gratuitous by juxtaposing man vs nature, underlining incest, how the Natives keep together, their myths, sins.... Medora and Vernon are actually twins, and there father killed himself because he could not heal Vernon's ""unnatural"" state, whose death also explains the many senseless murders he is perpetrating. 
Medora is angry that Vernon left her although promising that he would never do so, so she avenges herself by killing their son, whose ""sickness"" is due to his bloodline.. 
So many explanations left out, also the ending which tells how the Slones live in the wilderniss in an hidden igloo, Medora again pregnant.The movie suffers from the poor editing, simple narrative and absurd dialogues. I wished someone else, maybe from Alaska or Canada would have directed this movie with respect to the Natives, and the strange couple who should have been in the foreground of the movie, and not Core or Det. Marium. (Thinking of Kim Nguyen, e.g.)
There is actually so much mysticism, folklore, forbidden sins and telepathic bond in this old, and desolate village. The book also discloses why Medora got the wolf mask, and how it changed her. 
In the movie, the only scene between the couple is at the end, and they absolutely have no chemistry... which is a real shame.
Slone's animalistic nature was told many times in the novel, as in the inn when he sleeps in the bed where Medora slept. He smells and licks the bed, then masturbates. In the end, they also have animalistic and nude sex in the hot spring while Core lies there in pain. 
All of that was left out... the first half of the movie could have been shortened so that the second half could focus on the relationship and the mystery surrounding the village and the couple.Also, there was absolutely no need to show te rape scene in the beginning in Iraq. It is an artistic and stylistic decision how to proceed this scene, but one could have shown how the soldier chases the girl, but showing the rape in a close shot should have been left out, it is traumatizng and totally takes the attention from the next scene where Slone gets injured, as it is hard at that moment to care for him.I love slow-paced indie movies, especially when it has beautiful landscape or animal shots, however this movie suffers enormously from the lack of character motivation and development, no intense scenes (besides the shootout) and no facial expressions of the characters. The emphasis should have been on the Slones, their family, Cheeon (Julian Black Antelope IS SUCH A GREAT ACTOR!!!!), and the shaman Illanaq (Tantoo Cardinal awesomeness).
Shame. I have watched two Q&A videos on youtube after the premieres of that movie, and Saulnier states that they left many things unexplained but he himself was puzzled, and added that he wanted to show realism but also kept the mystery of what the characters believe, and that he just wanted to direct and not really focused on the plot... basically, style over substance!
Well, that's not how you approach a movie with a 30+million budget. Netflix,really, should not allow so much creative freedom to directors.

319,Buzz-talk,More questions than answers,3,27 October 2018,"Saulnier sets up a wide establishing shot of a harsh snow covered landscape. The bleak Alaskan village with its dilapidated homes sits innocuously against a white back drop of snow. The dark brooding sound track creates a feeling of quiet despair which is maintained throughout the film. Medora Slone (Riley Keough) is a desperate woman who lives a solitary existence waiting for her husband to return home from war. Although her character doesn't have much screen time her performance is convincing as a disturbed, emotionally traumatized mother. Russel Core (Jeffrey Wright) is a published wildlife expert who is estranged from his own daughter but seeks some kind of redemption.During the first part of the film the story shifts from the desolate wilderness of Alaska to the deserts of Iraq. Vernon Slone (Alexander Skarsgård) is quickly established as a cold individual who relentlessly pursues his own justice at any cost. Meanwhile Russel Core discovers an uncomfortable truth about the young boys killer and helps the local police. Towards the end of the first act the focus shifts to Vernon Slone when he returns from the Iraq war following an injury. Confronted with the profound grief of losing his son he decides to take matters in to his own hands. Now the film changes tempo as Vernon Slone goes on a killing spree aided briefly by his long term friend Cheeon (Julian Black Antelope).When the police chief Donald Marium (James Badge Dale) and Russel Core find a trail of carnage at the coroners they return to the village to find some answers. This brings the film to the climactic set piece. Marium visits Cheeon to ask him some questions but he doesn't cooperate. This scene produces a brutal shoot out which could quite easily have come from Heat. Saulnier doesn't shy away from the visceral realism of people being wounded and killed as Cheeon showers police with bullets from a machine gun. Eventually things end much as can be expected with dead bodies scattered on the snow. But there is no denying the raw power of this scene which leaves the third act feeling lukewarm in comparison.After the aforementioned criscendo the film returns to the wilderness which shares center stage once again. At this point the lead characters feel dispensable as Slone continues to hunt for the killer of his son leaving dead bodies in his wake. Discarding elderly natives and old friends who help him like used paper towels. Slone performs each killing with all the emotional verve of Michael Myers from Halloween, killing indiscriminately like a man possessed. In fact this is the only explanation for such carnage. A man who is possessed by an evil wolf spirit. But despite this fact the film still feels like it flounders in its attempt.Saulnier sets the mood of this film with Consummate professionalism but the narrative feels lost as the film progresses. What starts as a nature, survivalist tale becomes a mixture of violent art house horror sprinkled with elements of The Revenant. But no oscar nomination here. As the film progresses the performances feel underwhelming as the quiet insanity and ancient curse of the Alaskan natives takes hold of the main character.Hold the dark should have been a suspenseful thriller. But the slow pacing of this film and lack of direction in the third act made it meander. It has all the right ingredients to create an art house horror and some solid performances but the story leaves you feeling unsatisfied. The bleak location and cinematography help to create a dark and unforgiving narrative, but the film plods to its eventual ending with more questions than answers.",Hold the Dark

She and the 'wolf hunter' are having the most obnoxiously phony conversation I've ever witnessed (that's hyperbole of course). Here are a few examples of the stilted conversations:Him: You met your husband in the village?
Her: I didn't meet him anywhere. I knew him my own life. I don't have a memory he isn't in. Him: To go to war
Her: Someone on the radio said it's not a real war (whisper, glazy look)Her: He said he'd never leave me. Words can be worthless like that. (Whisper whisper)The term 'The child' has been dropped in several times as well. #awfulHe: but you were (pause) happy here (pause) once

Was going to stop watching right at the beginning when the buffalo is in the road. Alaska Fish and Game says there are about 900 bison in the entire, huge state. Doubt that one would stand around so you have to slowly drive past it like in Yellowstone. And if I'm going to nitpick - there's a dead elk being hauled off. No elk on the mainland in AK - only on a couple of SE islands. And the boy's body - was that a basement? They don't really do basements up there with the permafrost even if they are below the Arctic Circle (since above there would be no sun on winter solstice). And wolves don't attack people - even children. Wolf guy says very rare, but never is more accurate.

The main plot point with which the movie hooks you is never explained and you can also remove it from the plot and nothing changes. 
The other characters act as filler content exept for the couple. 
Bad directors trying to make something artsy citing ""brilliant cinematography"" as their main selling point. It's just lazy and incompetent film making. 
Anyway, a lot of dark undertones, pointless plot. The movie leaves you wanting, not for a decent ending but for a movie.

374,HailPaimon_,Saulnier's trademark violence and craftsmanship make for an atmospheric genre thriller,6,29 September 2018,"Don't go in expecting Green Room. This film is more of an atmospheric, slow burn with occasional bursts of intensity rather than a straightforward thriller.Some of the plot elements and how they are handled will turn people off but the craftsmanship here is impossible to ignore. The performances are for the most part strong and the visuals are beautifully bleak. The violence is explosive and disturbing. Fans of Saulnier, and fans of genre in general, will find a lot appreciate here.Those who want things wrapped up neatly may be disappointed, as the themes the film deals with, along with how it presents them, warrants a second watch. It's not necessarily a story with a satisfying conclusion and no loose ends. Some of the ambiguity felt unnecessary and could have been handled better, but the script is overall solid, if a bit of a mixed bag.Overall the film's story gets its message across, regarding the exploration of the line between human and animal, and the feral tendencies we bury deep in ourselves. It could have used a bit of cleanup getting there, but it's still a strongly crafted film above all else.6/10.",Hold the Dark

I have to disagree with most of the negative reviews here and I'm forced to assume they completely missed the central theme. This review is best meant for those who have seen it, as I can explain a few things that most people missed.Long story short, the couple in the movie are twins, but also live as husband and wife. She mentions it in the beginning when Core asks her how they met, she responds by saying she always knew him and doesn't have a memory without him. Also, the family picture in the drawer illustrated 2 kids the same age. There were other hints as well such as the Inn keeper mentioning their similar looks. Creepy, I know. Another thing people may have missed is the metaphor of the wolves sacrificing the pup for the pack to survive in correlation with Medora killing her own to survive ""the darkness"" of her reality.It's a layered movie and one that is very dark and eerie, more so than Wind River in my opinion. My only complaint is that it could have been chopped and/or edited maybe 10 to 15 minutes. Nonetheless it deserves better user reviews",Hold the Dark

I didn't find ANY of the characters particularly likeable, and I don't think I was supposed to. I did, however, find them interesting and memorable.
This isn't a story that is going to explain everything, or as some reviewers have pointed out, anything at all. It's widely open to interpretation from the moment it starts all the way to the end. For me, the movie was explained in the words of the female lead talking about her husband, who left her to go to war. ""I don't have a memory that doesn't have him in it. He said he'd never leave me. Words like that shouldn't be worthless."" The way she delivers those lines hit me like a ton of bricks. I think everything that happened here is rooted in those three sentences. There are some things I would have liked to see that I didn't, but I am tempted now to read the book and see if some of those questions are answered regarding backstory.

I realize that they are strange or ""unnatural"", as they are of the same...clan, bloodline or whatever and so was their son...so she killed him, to save him ""from the dark"" I guess. They try to make connections with the children's deaths to a wolves killing one of their own pups. The naturalist says wolves do this when stressed. Still, the film makers elude to some deeper, darker supernatural happenings, but never, EVER reveal any answers to the ever mounting questions. Why were the other two children murdered? Did the same women kill all the children? If so, why did Vernon's Eskimo buddy help him kill a bunch of police? He obviously has a problem with the kids dying ""No future without the children"". Why did his kids body not get buried? Why exactly does this Eskimo hate cops so much? Because the cops didn't find the other kids or try hard enough when everyone in town knows something or did nothing? Why did they bury the kid in the snow? Is he coming back to life later? Why did she detour to the mine camp if she was ultimately going to the hot spring a few hours hike from her home? To see the old man, get boots and leave the mask? Why did the father have beef with the old witch? She didn't kill his kid. Why did he ultimately NOT kill his wife after all this time and all this revenge carnage to both go unbury their dead son to walk off, hand in hand, with his corpse, to who knows where? That's not a payoff!!! Listen, like I said, I'm all for open interpretation and having to think a little, but this is just sloppy and ultimately leads to confusion and frustration.

No, I didn't read the novel and certainly don't plan to now that I've seen what they made of it, but if anyone asked what the actors' motivations are, it would have to be to showcase the blood spatter explosion special effects skills of the technical crew. And while we're on the subject, how is it that the police lieutenant and the lead character saunter home for a quiet family dinner after what would have been one of the most spectacular police gun battles in American history? Yeah, they seemed a bit down after a difficult day at work, but no intense after-action debriefings? No media clamor? No up the wazoo police paperwork? Note to casting: Just because you like the physical appearance of one of the leads, please don't make him and his dramatic foil look almost exactly the same. In short, one of those movies that demonstrates why Netflix needs to get over itself and ask ""What Would Irving Thalberg Do?"" before serving up overwrought yet underbaked cinematic casseroles to the global subscribing public.",Hold the Dark

436,bobbyb-49040,Worth the watch,8,7 June 2020,"I found this film engaging, and very violent.
The storyline begins with the disappearance of a young boy playing outside in an Alaskan winter setting, assumed to be the prey of a wolf, although we don't see the actual attack.
We then see the distraught mother call a wild ecologist and author, whom has studied wolves and came across a wolf, which he was forced to kill. The woman writes him and explains why she needs his help. He makes the trip to Alaska and the young mother asks him to find and kill the responsible killer wolf.
This is where the movie splits and takes on parallel stories of the people involved and others in the area., some very violent.
After a little nudity and weirdness between the mother and the author/hunter, he begins his hunt and comes across a pack of wolves 'savaging'; eating a pup for survival of the pack when the wolves are starving, or stressed.
This is the foundarion of the entire movie; killing ones own species, when stressed, and half-mad, or worse, due to stress in their environment.

Personally I love it when a movie allows me the space to make it 'mine'.
I don't need or even want to 'understand' what the makers mean.
With 'Hold The Dark' I deeply felt that the movie allows us to glimpse our own 'Dark', which we all hold, in whatever form.
That makes it a great film.
That, and the fact it was beautifully shot.
I did not read the book, but I found enough clues in the story to let the director guide me ever closer to the universal 'Dark', also in myself.
That way I could identify with the main characters on a deeper layer than with the most predictable 'Good vs. Bad' or 'Revenge & Justice' movies, however 'thrilling'.
Once you allow yourself to let go of the one-dimensional need 'to get it', the heart-shattering beauty of this film is a mirror to the often terrible, primal choices mankind has been making, searching for honest ways to deal with our often cruel or impossible 'Fate'.

Alas, this most recent attempt at filmmaking is a step backwards. While Jeffrey Wright offers a heartbreaking performance and the scenery is breathtaking, the overall picture is marred by a little too much self-indulgence on the part of the creative team. With a bloated runtime exceeding 2 hours, one has to question how much story there really is to tell. The plot seems to trod along and go nowhere with very capable actors filling scenes that add nothing to the plot. There is a secondary story between the main character and his daughter that adds nothing and takes up more time that could have been spent explaining the overall mystery, which devolves into unnecessary bloodshed. If you're looking for a snowy, wilderness thriller/adventure, check out the much more sublime Revenant or the underrated Charles Martin Smith vehicle Never Cry Wolf.",Hold the Dark

455,ClaviculaNox,Beautifully Captivating,9,1 October 2018,"There are so much negative reviews but it's really beautiful. Most of the reviews written is because they didn't understand the plot of the movie or what it represents.
It's a deeply dark movie on so many levels. 
It's a story inside a story, the mother killed her son because she was living in the dark. As her husband is her brother. Incist. 
And there are many implications and hints across the movie that shows that ""indirectly.""
The scene when he was looking for his wife in the hotel, the woman said ""you both have the same eyes and same hair""
The Indian hunter said ""your father said you are unnatural.""
The pictures inside the drawe, the second picture shows a bow and a girl sitting as a family by lake. 
The wolf mask, they both had it. Medora talks early on about the ""Dark"" that comes at night, a suffocating absence of light that represents the unknown and seems to alter those around them. Simply put, the Dark is a name given to the line between humanity and ferality; in the movie, we see in this desolate landscape the humanity of wolves and the wolves in humanity.
In the movie, this unspoken incestuous relationship and its thrust for survival is the plot key motivator. Indeed, it's why Medora killed their son - the act clearly parallels the wolves eating their own pup to keep the pack alive, with her trying to keep it going ahead of her husband's return - and explains Vern's conflicted hunt, outwardly powered by revenge but internally the part of something much more primal (as Russell says very early on, revenge is not nature's way).

Then she takes a bath in a terribly dark scene, I couldn't make out anything for a bit (iPhone indoors) and she whispers worse than I have ever heard in a movie. There are captions but why do you have to totally depend on them? What kind of lousy filmmaking is this? It struck me as pretentious.

After watching this movie for two hours and being left wondering what the heck even happened, I resorted to the comments to find that this movie was based off a book that explains things much better. I love movies based on books and comparing the two for similarities and differences. However, I feel that if a book is good enough to warrant a movie adaptation, the movie needs to be able to hold its own and be followed by those who haven't read the books. This movie falls FAR from that standard. There was absolutely no way that a viewer was going to be satisfied with the ending or even be able to follow the storyline.I did pick up on the guy that said the husband/wife look alike as well as the picture of the two of them as children on the dock. But it seems like a more obvious/likely plot point that the two of them grew up in the same Scandinavian town as childhood friends, got married and maybe did something that caused them to flee. Twins? Not where my brain would automatically jump. The mom at the end? Never would have known. So many random plots twisted into a hot mess that is supposed to be a story.

478,jribeiro739,Read the book after. Then watch again. Ending explained.,8,23 November 2018,"After watching Hold The Dark I felt compelled to read the novel by William Giraldi. After my first time watching the movie I was really left with many questions that needed answering. The movie was well shot and every scene seemed to keep me wondering how the movie would come to an end. After reading the novel I then understood the movie in its entirety. Here is the movie explained.The Slones are twins! Throughout the movie there is always mention of how similar they look or how they have shared a long past. Medora in the beginning of the movie when answering Core about how long she knew him says ""I can not remember a memory without him in it."" When Vernon is ruffling through clues in the cardboard box as to where Medora might be there is a picture of a little boy and girl sitting on a dock. A picture of him and her, brother and sister. While in the motel where Vernon sleeps in the same room where Medora did, the receptionist mentions how they look similar and have a ""Scandinavian"" look. The man who sold wolfs oil to Vernon's dad also mentions how they have similar eyes and a similar nose. Them being twins is revealed in the book where the mother of Medora and Vernon helps Core at the end. When Core sees her face he then realized that she was the mother and that they were twins. Although they do show this in the movie it is not explained that she is the mother and that they are twins.The use of the mask by both Vernon and Medora releases the ""wolf"" inside of them. Whenever there is a scene where the mask is worn, it ends up violent or deranged. In the book an elder gives the mask to Medora while she is pregnant with Bailey. She says that Medora must kill the baby for it will be sick. Despite Medora and Vernon's reluctance to listen to the elder, (Vernon actually kills her) Medora keeps the mask.There is so much explained in the book then in the movie. The silent but ever bonding relationship between Vernon and Cheeon. The history of Medora and Vernon's father (whom actually commit suicide). How infanticide has been a regular occurrence in the past among primates and mammals.Of course there is also much that is not explained and left to the viewer to decide.Overall I feel the movie was consistent with the themes and characters protracted in the novel. The film like the novel, was captivating and left you wanting more. I don't feel the low reviews that this film has received in IMDB by some viewers is just.

484,jonathan-kronheimer,One for the masochists and people that think they know what cinema is.,1,6 December 2018,"There's a difference between being artistic and being vague. An artist will have a clear idea about the message they wish to convey, and I don't think that's the case with the director of this film. So his film is vague, and it feels like he's relying on the audience to discover some meaning within this tangled mess of badly edited shots rather than showing them clear paths of interpretation and then letting them decide for themselves what the meaning of the film should be.Now I'll talk about the screenplay. The dialogue is terrible. It's a combination of the acting and the directing as well, but the dialogue is nothing but dry, stilted, and wooden, and I realize this is intentional, but it doesn't come off well at all. The characters are also held completely at arms length, partly because they all speak in the same cold monotone that I just described, but really the killer of this film is that never are the character's motivations made clear. People just do things completely without provocation, with no logic, and if there is a logic it's never made clear to the viewer (so there may as well be none). And usually the things people do is horrifically violent. I'm all for a Tarantino film, a Scorsese film; I have no issue with blood and guts, as long as I can see a reason for it to be in the film. This film, with its insistent lack of clarification, presents only the violence with no justification, and as I've explained, that justification must come from character motives, not from the director explaining his choices in an interview.Another part of writing a screenplay is pacing, and this film has no pacing (at all). A slow film can be well paced. I'll use David Fincher's Zodiac as an example of a well paced film: the characters are so well crafted that Fincher is able to easily manipulate the tension level of the film. the audience won't care about the actuall murders themselves, they will care about Graysmith's development, obsession, and eventual catharsis, and his character steadily changes of over the course of the film, creating for a smooth, long arch that ends with a brilliant emotional climax. This film is lumpy and misshapen, with all the tension being given away early on. The high-point of tension in the film comes right before the half-way point, and from there, the film tries to keep itself afloat but can't. A shootout scene at about half-way seems to take an age, while really I can't see how it moves along the plot in any way, and it seems to have no long-lasting effect on the characters (because again, they only express themselves through staccato sentences and worried looks).I will give the film a point for visual merits; this film is beautifully shot. BUT that don't mean a damn thing if the screenplay is terrible. So no, I will not give this film anything other than one star, because I'd rather watch a badly-shot film telling a thoughtful story than a wonderful collection of images that have nothing to say. Anyone that likes this film is either a masochists that enjoy spending a couple hours forcing themselves to watch terrible movies, or they're someone that has confused vagueness with artistry, and they think that there is a world of meaning underneath the thick slathering of guts that coats this film; they will try their best to find it, but they never will because it's not there. If they do find a meaning, it's one that they have fabricated themselves, not one that the writer/director has placed there for the audience to find. And you may say it's the audience's interpretation that matters, and i agree that in an open-ended film, it's really the viewer that will give the film a message, but in order for an end to be open, there must be a structure to begin with, and it's that structure that this film doesn't have.

489,Wanderbru,"a step in the dark by Saulnier, after the bright ones into blue ruin and green room",5,24 August 2020,"Saulnier's clan disappointed me here. This movie is definetely a step back from The blue ruin and The green room. While these had a well thought screenplay that managed to trigger all the thrill while remaining credible, this movie spreads entirely around violence scenes that don't really make any sense: rather than building step by step a nerve-cracking suspense and then letting it explode in extraviolent killing scenes, it's the abrupt and unexplained gun shots that come out of nowhere killing someone here and someone there that build the entire plot. Saulnier, as most of us, likes guns, we know this. But here he let them do everything. the absurd scene where Coonah massacres the entire police departement in his frontyard is particularly stupid and disturbing.
the movie works because guns and violence always work, but it's really cheap cinematography. Throwing in some random symbolysm (man = wolf) and foreshadowing a pagan form of religiosity that embodies the darkness, primitiveness and ferocity of human mind, doesn't really save it. Nor the beautiful photography of the astounding wild enviroments and the visionariety of some shots (the wolf mask of Vernon are impressive). We know Saulnier aims for pure entertainment, we are not supposed to over-research some hidden meaning we may have missed at first to bail this movie out.

Which I got and the book is amazing.
Even though there are these acts of brutal violence that catch you off guard, the film has a meditative quality - the scenery and the sound design and the music is enticing. There's an undercurrent of menace and anticipation that would seemingly counter that but somehow they work. I loved the performances of Jeffrey Wright and Alexander Skarsgård. They play off each other beautifully. Alexander Skarsgård has locked down the cold and calculated nature of Vernon Slone and you don't know what he will do, he is so cold and affectless. It's brilliant.
I have a few problems with the film with respect to the Indigenous elements. Firstly, that they didn't cast Yup'ik characters with Yup'ik or Inuit actors. They cast Indigenous actors but not actors who are Indigenous to this area of Alaska. Secondly, I personally really enjoy throat singing so I was happy to hear it in the film, but they used it over the menacing parts to underscore the evil and violence which is just incredibly problematic. I feel like this film could have been great if they had a Yup'ik advisor in the production meetings. Indigenous people aren't interchangeable. When you have Indigenous characters who play vital roles in the story, I think the crew should respect the distinct culture of the people they are portraying.",Hold the Dark

A really small and remote place forgotten and avoided by government and authorities with mainly indegenous inhabitants.The book writer was called to action by one of the missing kid's mother whom offers a place to stay while her husband fights in the Afeghan war.By looking to the villagers and due to extreme weather conditions as well as influenced by the plot I was lead to believe this movie would be about werewolves or serial killers - no, this movie is about grief and revenge. One of the many ways to deal with grief.Acting is great, sounds and effects are amazingly realistic and my only complaint is that there are some questions left unanswered.I know this a book adaptation which only got more interested in the book for the details in the story that I felt were missing in the movie. The main characters were well developed as the actors are experienced enough to push the story into darker places but lots of secondary characters could add more passion and meaning to the sometimes shallow excuses used to exploit an action scene.

I do enjoy movies that make you work a little but I don't think this one gave you all the tools to put everything together. An extra scene or two, even a couple of extra lines of dialogue could have made this one so much clearer/better. It was that close.",Hold the Dark

567,silicon_requiem,Jeffrey Wright is excellent but overall baffling film,3,28 December 2018,"Having read other reviews it appears the book sheds a lot of light on what is simply baffling in the film, particularly the last thirty minutes or so. Art direction, aesthetics and so forth are great and Jeffrey Wright is excellent, but as a final product I was left simply wondering what I had just watched and why any of it had happened. Why does Vernon go on a killing spree, which everyone assumes is a vendetta murder parade only to forgive the woman that he is hunting? Why is there so much killing for so little reason? He could have recovered the body of his son and found his wife before the cops without having to murder pretty much everyone he comes across. The more you pull at the threads of plot the more the film unravels which is sad because it has so much going for it but the story telling falls apart in the final sequences and you are left questioning why everything happened leading up to it. Apparently the book sheds light on some of these issues such as the couple being twin siblings (hinted at in film but never explained) but on it's own the film fails badly to construct a coherent story and instead leaves hollow questions and not much else at it's conclusion.",Hold the Dark

Intriguing but bare-boned, minimalist concept, sure; but no real story. Did someone say ""Book?""

He brings a stoic gravity to every role he plays, and it really serves him in this role as the survivor protagonist.I was skeptical of Riley Keough, but she really brought it for this role. She's weird, wracked with complicated emotions, and fully immersed in her role.Alexander Skarsgård plays a force of nature that is given almost no dialogue but an incredible amount of physical drama. He plays this role stoic, imposing and dangerous and it's impressive.The film itself is full of incredible craft as well. Great cinematography. Very complex scene building. All of which is a testament to the talent of Saulnier
and the production crew he put together for this piece.Unless you're watching for it, the worst horror in the story isn't obvious, and I think that context is what some of these folks who didn't like the film missed.The drama and story feels torn out of a western gothic movie like the Searchers or No Country for Old Men.

I read some of the reviews of the movie, and I can understand that some people were confused and irritated by the confusing storyline. You sat and waited for the bomb to drop all through the movie, although there were some hints in the movie that suggested certain motives for why some characters acted the way they did. Things were left unexplained, and I think that was what made the movie great. Because of this, there was tension through out the whole movie. If you haven't figured out why the characters acted like they did, watch it again and give it a new shot. I won't spoil it. I can say that Alexander Skarsgård clearly was a psycopath.

604,osbornese,Took me a minute,8,9 October 2018,"At first I had the same thought everyone else did and that was ""What the Hell am I watching"". But this movie has a lot of deep meaning to it... The two main characters I believe are twins. When the wolf killer comes to see Medora she she tells him it's about surviving there. She talks about when the dark comes and how lonely it is. I think that since the ppl of the town were so isolated. It's so lonely and cold and dark, that they became unnaturally close. Twins they say are closer anyway but coupled with the isolation I believe they fell in love. I think they would run away in secret at first but ppl knew, and in a weird way they understood. I think some characters, like the medicine woman, knew it wasn't right but they understood the loneliness that drive them to it. The villagers... they were like a wolf pack, doing what they had to survive. Vernon's bff that got shot up, it was illyded that his wife left him and his daughter. I believe he too may have taken to his daughter hence his understanding with Vernon. Within that pack of the village was the singular pack of Medora and Vernon... she knew the solstice was coming and couldn't bare it without Vernon away at war. I think that's why she killer her son, to bring him home. That's where the wolf hunter compared the pack eating the cubs to survive to Medora killing her son. I'm not sure why everyone wanted the wolf hunter to live, maybe to tell the story? Or maybe bc they equate the darkness and the evil with wolfs? I think the wolf thing was more symbiotic than physical. And so since he was a wolf hunter he was a killer of evil?

The cinematography is exquisite, it's use of minimalistic, practical lighting works wonders with the sound, with the camera work and movement maintaining a constant level of mystery within the characters and environment. Where the narrative is not exactly complex or 'deep', it is enjoyable to watch, to try and understand the incredibly weird set of antagonist characters, both incredibly violent with an almost possessed madness that instructs their crimes. The pacing is slow, yet deliberate, in areas it is relaxing to watch, even though there are some tense moments.

I really enjoyed the whole filmSPOILER ALERT COMING UP GOR THE NEGATIVE REVIEWERS!.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................When Russell tries to beat Vernon to Medora's location, he's wounded with an arrow. He then watches the husband try to strangle his wife, but when she removes Vernon's mask, they begin to kiss, proving that despite the death of their son, they missed and still love each other. As Russell fades out of consciousness, the documentarian realizes the truth thanks to past conversations with the mother. Their family were outcasts in the village, and when he asked Medora where she met Vernon, she told him they knew each other all their life.
Russell discerns they're brother and sister, recalling the family photos he saw when they were kids, and their stark resemblance, being of Norse blood with bright blue eyes. Medora was living with this darkness herself which she didn't want Bailey to inherit. It was guilt that he was the product of incest, and she sacrificed him so this darkness from her and Vernon, something she construed to be evil, would not pass down to the boy.",Hold the Dark

630,DylanHoff88,Completely empty,4,23 October 2018,"This was a film that ultimately could have been a very engaging and visceral experience, due to the film's simple revenge plot, decent cast and a setting which could potentially provide for a variety of interesting visuals and cinematography. Unfortunately this opportunity is completely wasted on a shallow script. This film seemed to be aiming to be a revenge thriller type film (similar to The Revenant), however the way in which this story and its characters are presented just felt incredibly empty. The film just plods along from scene to scene with no real interesting character interaction or dialogue, this combined with the film's slow pacing really makes for an extremely engaging experience. I don't mind slow pacing in storytelling at all, in fact some of favorite films are slow paced, however what's essential when telling a story in a slow paced manner is to either give something for the audience to chew in terms of substance and concept or provide some sense of dramatic effect that entices the audience to want to keep watching. The way in which this film is paced gives of the sense that the director was trying to create some form of suspense and tension, however it was very poorly executed as none of the scenes felt like they were building up to anything. The only scenes that are of actual consequence to the narrative don't happen to the last twenty minutes of the film.What adds even more to the emptiness of this film how the characters are written. None of the characters felt in the slightest bit well defined at all. The film follow's Jeffery Wright's character as the protagonist, however throughout the entirety of the film you learn almost nothing about his character other than the fact that he has a daughter, which I guess is the only reason as to why should connect to him in any way according to this script. The large majority of the film is presented through his perspective yet we as the audience are given no sense of character development to allow us to better understand him and thus attach to him, his character just feels really plain and uninteresting and doesn't seem to have any sort of distinct personality or character. All the other characters in the film are either given minimal screen time or die in the first scene they're in. These poorly written and undefined characters is what in turn causes the problem of what should be a simple plot to then become needlessly complicated and confusing, because throughout the whole film you're constantly questioning why these characters are doing what they're doing because you never really understand their motivations.The only real positives I could find in this film were the practical effects for the gore and violence, and some of the visuals. The film was for the most part was well shot, some of the landscape wide angle shots of Alaskan scenery made for some very aesthetically pleasing visuals, although it was nothing mind-blowing.Overall this film just felt like a waste of time. There was nothing of substance to be found in the film's plot and no likable or interesting characters, it was just really boring.4/10",Hold the Dark

634,suren-149-241598,A Violent Unforgiving Pseudo Supernatural Thriller,5,29 September 2018,"I wanted to like this movie, despite the fact that Netflix Movies are now where once good directors come to die.There's a great shootout scene with a guy who's a lot like Danny Trejo except taller, bigger and meaner. That would be the highlight of the film.The rest is violence and cinematic meditations on killing comprised of good and bad people dying for good and bad and sometimes no reasons other than they got in the way. No answers will be find here which is the chief frustration for the viewer.A Nordic forbidden love incest story gets t-boned by shapeshifting Druidic shaman skin walker / white walker mythology that sadly never amounts to more than a hill of beans. So much great production value is wasted on a vile film that wants to be a dark, yet redemptive western, yet no one feels truly redeemed, and is instead an extremely bleak, almost nihilistic thriller where the good guys all die because something's wrong with the sky.Personally, I hate pseudo supernatural films that only enjoy jerking off to (or with) tribal folklore and appropriations of ancient legends, and this one only gets as far as a wolf mask on a man that makes him more of a killer, except he's the same exact amount of killer without the mask for most of the film. The mask, the folklore, the incest narrative and all the wolf behavior is ultimately wasted. You do not care about anyone and in the end hope for either an explanation, supernatural confirmation or transformation, or at the very least a glorified death for the Nordic incest couple, but instead we are given nothing except some strange unfulfilling and ultimately unearned redemption for our poor scared and scarred grizzled wolf man writer.5/10 - Great production value, some good and some terrible acting, but ultimately mediocre writing which is now the hallmark of all Netflix Movies.

I think the plot up till climax when protagonist and antagonist faces eachother has some decent potential to give a nice pay off, after watching a hole movie with the underlying tone of something mysterious being held away from the viewer intentionally. A wife who claims wolves took her child and calling a professor of wolves to come hunt them down, even though he seems to have little to no experience with hunting. The locals with aboriginal origin, being kind of spiritual but in no way depicted as such. The violent turn of event which seem to escalate for sake of violence and has no real impact on the main characters. I did like the way Sheriff died, unexpected and you only just started to care for the to soon to be father. With the indirect form of information giving to the viewer a payoff that gave hints to the how's and why's surely was expected.
Why the mother chose to kill her son. Why the farther decided to kill half the police force just to get to his wife, so he could not avenge his son but be with her? Where they going to eat the child at the end? Why was something wrong with the sky? 
3/10 great potential, no payoff, too vague to interpret, the lack of information didn't serve as depth but rather the opposite. An incredible dull climax and even more disappointing ending. Will add that Jeffrey Wright did an overall decent acting, i imagine he was giving as little as the viewer was giving to work with.Alexander Skarsgård a expressionless psychopath, even though it might be realistic, it didn't do anything good for this type of movie.James Badge Dale delivered a solid Sheriff role, likable and genuine, though his role didn't offer much depth or charisma.

Lastly, of course, some books are exceedingly well written but are butchered by a film director and crew (at worst) or otherwise fall short of the mark. Whether William Giraldi's book is a masterful piece of prose I do not know as I have not read it. However, Jeremy Saulnier's offering of two hours (plus) left a lot to be desired. Although beautifully filmed in terms of scenery, special effects and acting ability, the plot was bewildering (leaving many questions unanswered) and the pace overly slow for the most part. The action scenes (which are disturbing in their own right) were what kept me hanging on to the end of the film, never knowing quite what would be round the next corner in terms of shock and plot!

Was I frustrated at parts during my first watch? Yes. Did I have to look up what the movie was about? Yes. But did I, overall, enjoy the movie? Yes. I enjoyed it quite a bit once I threw out my preconceived notions of what I thought this film would be.Hold the Dark is the third film directed by Jeremy Saulnier. It stars the always fantastic Jeffrey Wright as Russell Core, a wolf expert and author who receives a letter from a grieving mother who asks him to come hunt the wolves who took her son. This takes him to northern Alaska where he, as well as the audience, soon find that things are not as they seem.This is where the movie shifts from being another well directed mostly conventional thriller film from Saulnier to something more metaphoric and packed with heavy-handed symbolism. If you're familiar with the director's previous work and went into this movie expecting more of the same this can feel a bit like you're being put through the wringer. You expect the movie to explain itself to you but then it simply ends. Like Saulnier's other films it is incredibly hyperviolent. And the more I think about it, the more sense This movie is a dark look into the human id, what connects us to animals. Alexander Skarsgaard's character is taken over by his animal side, the dark, while Jeffrey Wright's character resists it and retains his humanity through to the end of the film. The dialogue is well written and the direction is stellar. This is a film that is packed to the brim with incredible moments, albeit mostly towards the latter half.There's just some directors who people permit to have an artistic lisence and some that don't. David Lynch and David Cronenberg are directors who are allowed to experiment and toy with conventional story telling and people will eat up anything they put out without a second thought. But when a director who doesn't have the same artistic licence attempts something in a similar vein, it will be decried for the same reasons that people heap praise on those two directors for. Often by the same people it seems. I can better explain this movie than I can explain Mulhalland Drive. Does that make this a superior movie? Not necessarily, as these types of movies are truely in the eye of the beholder. It's a lot harder to quantify what makes these types of movies good. If you liked it you liked it, if you hated it you hated it.To summarize, I really did enjoy this movie, despite some flaws. Sure, people say that if you have to look up what a movie is about then it must not have been a very good movie. Yeah, I'm sure these people fully understood movies like Donnie Darko and Eraserhead on their first watch too. I really wanted to give this movie an 8 or a 9 but I had to knock it down to a 7 as this movie does have issues and there are a couple of scenes, especially towards the beginning, that I wish had been trimmed down. It's one of those movies that's hard to recommend though, as it's hard to pin down who the audience for this will be. But, I think Jeffrey Wright got as close as anybody will in an interview he did with Newsweek:""If you like to be freaked out and taken on an epic journey it's a nice home for you.""",Hold the Dark

Jeez! Do you smart-asses hit 'submit' after creating your masterpiece reviews and then dance around the room in glee at how sophisticated you sound and how everyone in the universe will now know with absolute certainty exactly how intelligent and witty you all are? Is this a major source of pride in your life? That must be it. It's one thing to not like something and express that but it's another thing entirely to berate anything so viscerally simply so you can let the world know you're so damn brilliant. Thank you so much for enlightening the rest of us idiots out here who just don't understand movies and cinema on the same level as you do. Where would we be without your keen insight? 
OK, I had to say that. People just piss me off when they so obviously use these forums to make themselves sound so cool. You realize you just sound like someone that nobody ever wants to watch a movie with, let alone socialize, right?
OK, for my review: I actually liked Hold the Dark quite a bit. I don't see how anyone can say this was boring or had no twists or turns the viewer didn't see coming. BS! Did you fall asleep? This film is loaded with them! Maybe I'm just incredibly naive (let me have it, I know you will) but I was really stunned by more than a few moments I did not see coming. Yes, this is a slow, brooding, Alaskan film but it's anything but boring. The slow pace sets you up perfectly for what's around the corner but you can't possibly see coming. If you tell me you saw it coming when those first two cops got capped, you're lying. That was truly a ""WTF?"" moment. I love those in good movie. 
I totally agree that Hold the Dark is less than all-revealing in it's story line but that's actually OK with me. Sometimes really good fiction should do that, especially when it deals with really dark, intense, possibly super-natural subject matter as this does. They could have spelled it out for us, sure, but where's the fun in having that done every single time? And why do you need everything spelled out for you in big crayon letters all the time anyway? Ever ask yourself that question?

They just seem to drag you into waiting for the conflict to happen or the revolution of the story to show up and then you get faced with the fact that the movie has ended while you are at the same emotional/intellectual tone as when it started. You feel that you have wasted hours of your time for nothing. You even get to feel worse for the man hours and money that have been spent on such a great production while having such a weak story.Having that said, I have to say that I feel shocked to see the difference between Netflix's series and their movies. Their series are usually great hits with such amazing stories while their movies are the absolute opposite.Finally, If netflix is ever going to improve on their movies, they need to understand that we as viewers do not like to stay under suspense or mystery for extended periods. You need to give the viewer some answers thru out the movie.

The director imagines a bunch of cool scenes and sequences that he'd like to include in the movie... stuff like a guy staring down a wolf. A spooky blood ritual over a coffin. A wounded cop getting dragged out of overwhelming gunfire. They get some very skilled people to handle the scenery and camera and costumes, and some decent actors.Then, they just completely forget to bother with anything like a story or plot. The director just loosely crams these scenes together, one after the other, without and reasoning or logical motivation to justify them. There's no dialogue to explain these events. No development or emotions or clues. They are just random things that happen. It's like a robot who doesn't understand empathy or emotions just generated a movie based on sequences from other movies. ""We'll present the audience with these familiar cliches that cause emotions. The audience will feel these emotions. Man fumbling for gun while wolf charges him = they will feel suspense. Cops getting shot out of the blue = they will feel shock. People wearing masks and acting weird = they will feel creeped out. Wolves eating a baby wolf = they will feel revusion. After enough emotions are felt, we will end the movie. This will be a good movie.""They come up with all these mysteries, and try to do that thing where ""we don't explain anything because it will be thought provoking and you can fill in your own blanks"". But if you explain literally NOTHING then it doesn't provoke thought, it provokes irritation and confusion.Why did this woman kill her kid? Why TF invite a random author she doesn't know to ""hunt"" an imaginary wolf she knows didn't kill her son? She can get away with the ""wolves took him"" story if she didn't allow a stranger into her house to find the corpse. Why save the corpse anyway?Why try to seduce him, in the most creepy awkward way possible?Why just leave suddenly, giving the stranger the opportunity to discover the body and making herself a fugitive?Eric from True Blood - why is he a nice guy in 50% of the scenes (stopping a rape, saving/sparing poor Bernard) and a random murderous asshole in the other 50% (killing the dude near the inn, shooting those cops)?Why even kill those cops? So they won't capture the woman I guess? OK but if you kill cops, more cops come after you. Unless, I suppose, all 20 of them gather in this little 30 square foot patch of ground in front of a totally immobile machine gun and allow themselves to mowed down.Why is this machine gun psycho helping eric and willing to die for him, was there even one throwaway line explaining this, that I missed? Why did the cop not arrest him, before he had a chance to hole up?Why does the one cop not immediately shoot this obviously deranged guy who just murdered a dozen cops, a guy who clearly is holding a handgun?Why murder the old guy near the inn? Why do a probably-fatal shot on Bernard, then save him? Why does he just passively sit there and not try to reason with the guy, or ask him why?What's the point of the indian healing ritual, if they were just gonna take him to a proper hospital? The damn arrow should have punctured his lung (and who doesn't want a nice smoke under those conditions?)... no cop is gonna hold off on taking that guy to a hospital so that indian women can give him the tickle ceremony.Did his estranged daughter get from wherever to alaska in the few hours it took between them recovering him from the cave, and him waking up? The wolves aren't gonna eat him while he's lying there wounded and they're starving? Are we supposed to guess they're skaarsgard and his wife or something?

A.S. is convincingly robotic as the injured returning war vet bent on making things right in his stark and twisted mind - taking everything out on everybody. But you get the feeling that he was like that before he even left for the war. I really liked Jeffrey Wright in this - haven't seen too much of him elsewhere. Deliberate and almost witnessing the events as if he was the one watching the movie. The setting and locales contribute superbly to the feeling of physical loneliness and emotional desolation.

Anyway, there are some good scenes in which one person is firing a large-caliber automatic weapon and slaying human beings.

767,johnmkmitchell,An Exploration On How Curiosity Kills The Cat,8,9 October 2018,"If you are a fan of thrilling mystery, do not pass Hold The Dark. It is a meticulously crafted movie with a non-linear narrative, not quite in the league of Westworld. It rewards viewers who pay attention, which might be to the movies detriment. But for those who are able to piece together the puzzle pieces chewed up by wolves, there is a pleasant reward. Hold The Dark as directed Jeremy Saulnier; Blue Ruin, Murder Party, and Green Room, manages to capture the claustrophobic nature of emptiness and seclusion in a state that is larger than Texas. The Alaskan landscape serves as the backdrop and through costume design, set design, glorious acting, and fantastic cinematography create the illusion of the bitter bite of cold; even beneath your blankets. We as the audience get to revel in imagery, misery, and mystery that surrounds a small Alaskan village that is on a one way trip to a ghost town. Of course we as an outsider to the village's mysteries follow the more relatable character portrayed by the talented Jeffrey Wright; playing Russell Core.Russell Core, aside from being an author and animal behaviorist, is an outsider to the village and we are allowed to experience the movie through his experiences. Because of this, the movie does feel slow at times as conversations happen that hide hints, tips, and lore throughout this movie. At times it feels like a conversation that one would ""zone out"" on and missed an important question your wife, husband, teacher, or business peers had asked. With that said, even the most innocuous of conversations can reveal more than one really wants to know.The movie isn't about in your face thrill and tension but rather the mystery and question; Why? That isn't to say the movie doesn't have its thrills but one might find themselves asking that one question over and over. Hold the Dark amounts to a twisted Alice In Wonderland scenario where instead of nonsensical words we are hit with foreign culture, traditions, and murder. Alice or Russell Core, is squarely in the center of it trying to survive just as we as the audience survive to find the answer to the question of the unknown.",Hold the Dark

774,kaseygriffin,This movie is very unrealistic and didn't make any sense.,2,16 October 2018,"Right off the bat, this movie is weird. The second I get invited to some weird lady's house and she comes out of the bathroom naked, wearing a wolf mask and whispering weird things, I'm getting the hell out of there. I don't understand why the old man stayed. There are a lot of other things wrong with this movie as well.First of all, how does nobody smell that dead body in the basement? Those things absolutely wreak. And the whole incest thing made zero sense until I legitimately had to google the end of the movie. Luckily, somebody who had read the book gave me some answers that the movie left out. It was also dumb how the witch-doctor lady knew about it all along, but never decided to tell anyone. She could've saved all of those lives, including her own, from those sociopaths.The scene that upset me the most though was how the native man effortlessly killed the entire police force with absolutely no cover. He was set up in a second-story window, in a wooden house (not bulletproof), coverless, just firing away and mowing down officers. A one-armed child could've made that shot and you're telling me 10+ tactically trained cops couldn't? The police even had long guns and cover, while the native man had zero cover and was standing still. In the real world, the police would've ended that threat in a matter of seconds.The description was nothing like the actual plot either. I was excited for a wolf hunter movie, not a twisted incest killfest between two siblings that like to wear wolf masks. Very disappointing.",Hold the Dark

James Badge Dale's sheriff character is likable; but after the massacre, several men dead or wounded, going on a dangerous journey the following day with one rifle, without FBI is a big stretch.Perhaps this movie would have benefited from blending a malevolent alien presence into the story line ... a Dreamcatcher lite (would have least kept me awake).",Hold the Dark

However, the author losses himself in believing his movie/story makes sence. People never truly know their work that they put so much time into is TERRIBLE unless someone tells them it is. Saying the movie is good or descent because actors are great and the environment is wonderful; isent enough to Really make a movie. The story is cool with a kind of ware-wolf but not really story.
