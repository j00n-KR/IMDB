0,MartinHafer,"Now that I'm older, I can definitely relate to Edgar!",7,11 December 2019,"When I was six, I went to see ""The Aristocats"" in the theater and enjoyed it thoroughly. Now, almost 50 years later, I'm seeing it for the second time....and not surprisingly my reaction is a tad different. This review is intended for older audiences. Kids will love it....adult probably will like it.The story begins with a crazy rich lady meeting with her lawyer to draw up a will. She wants to give her money to her four cats...and, if anything should happen to them, the butler, Edgar, will get the money. Naturally, Edgar overhears this and plans of getting rid of the cats once and for all. Unfortunately for him, while he does catnap the cats, they escape and the film consists of the mother cat and her three kittens making their way back home. An alley cat, O'Malley, befriends these pampered pets and helps them on their journey.As an adult, I noticed a lot of stuff kids probably won't care about very much. The biggest thing I noticed was how poor the animation was compared to most other Disney cartoons. While the cats were animated well, the cats' owner looked pretty garish and hurredly drawn. The same goes for some of the other characters. The animation marks the low point for Disney for full-length films and looks unfinished and ugly at times. The other thing I noticed is how simple the story is--too simple. The cats are stolen, the cats return....and the rest seemed like filler. Overall, not a big film at all...it was enjoyable. But it's also one of the least of the Disney 'classic' films...if not the least. I'd place it among ""The Rescuers Down Under"" quality-wise.By the way, I mentioned this in the summary. But as an adult, I actually could sympathize with Edgar. After all, some balmy old lady leaving her fortune to her cats is pretty dopey!",The Aristocats
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the better Disney movies after the Jungle Book,9,27 February 2009,"The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all, Everybody wants to be a Cat is a classic and the title song is brilliantly sung by Gigi's Maurice Chavelier. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.(a good thing)The plot(about a greedy butler and a fortune, reminds me of Bailey's Billions) was a little unoriginal, but worked very well, and the script was really funny, especially the fights between the kittens. They remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. My favourite scene was the chase of Edgar with the two dogs, who were always fighting about who was the leader. The voice talents were a delight, most notably Phil Harris, whom I recognised from the Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor, from the Rescuers. The supporting characters, namely Scat Cat, were also well done. In conclusion, a really pleasant film, that is definitely underrated. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",The Aristocats
2,SnoopyStyle,fun and light old school,7,6 October 2017,"It's pre-war Paris. Duchess is a well groomed cat with three kittens; Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse. Man servant Edgar overhears their loving elderly owner Madame Adelaide Bonfamille changing her will. She plans to leave her estate to the cats with Edgar as her heir after the cats' death. He decides to abandon the cats in the country. Stray cat Thomas O'Malley falls for Duchess and leads the family back to Paris.The song and music is big band and jazzy. It's the waning years of old school Disney animation. It is fun and light but lacks any long-lasting drama. The old school feel fits the time period and setting of the story. It doesn't have the big iconic tune although a couple of them are pretty catchy. The cats are cute. Edgar is a functional villain but the movie needs a more immediate villain in the middle while he is separated from the cats. There should be an animal villain hunting the family to heighten the drama. There is a stretch between being abandoned and returning to face Edgar where the movie lacks any tension. In any case, the movie has a good nature light fluffiness that is quite appealing.",The Aristocats
3,mark.waltz,The end of Walt's legacy.,6,27 April 2016,"Enjoyable for what it is, ""The AristoCrats"" simply for me brings back memories of seeing it when it first came out. I recalled the rather pretentious butler, Edgar, the kindly madame (who still looked like Cinderella's step-mother even if she was sweet), the fatherless kittens of ""Duchess"" and all the other assorted animals who came in and out of the slight story-two pranksterish country hounds, two overly helpful but ultimately bossy geese, a suspicious horse, a lovable mouse, and of course the various alley cats of all backgrounds who had a penchant for Le Jazz Hot. Seen 46 years later, it took me back to the small neighborhood theater that my parents dropped my siblings and I off at for 90 minutes while they went grocery shopping, and the line-up of Disney re-releases, this one being in first run and the others accompanying it as part of a children's matinée theater festival.Sweet sounding Eva Gabor is the lovable and classy Duchess whose three kittens look as if they could all have had different dads. Where the father is never is explained, and when Phil Harris joins their group after nasty Edgar dumps the cat family in the French countryside, it is obvious that Gabor has romance on her mind with this new potential Popsicle. Edgar has overheard Madame indicate that her money will go to her cats with him as executor, and in order to get his hands on her money faster decides to dispose of the cat family. With his tiny little hat popping off his huge, fat head every time his motorcycle has a back-fire, Edgar takes them out of Paris, looses them thanks to the chasing of the hound dogs, and must return when he realizes that there is evidence which could expose his plot. By this time, the cats are on their way back to Paris with the help of the very Irish Harris, and they meet up with his pals, led by Scatman Crothers' ""Scat Cat"" who leads a bunch of alley cats in the big musical number ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"".Going from pooh bear to tiny house mouse, Sterling Holloway is a lovable little rodent who is good friends with the classy felines and goes out of his way to find them and expose the nasty Edgar. He even risks being eaten, and that makes him perhaps the most endearing of all the non-cat animals. ""Beverly Hillbillies"" co-star Nancy Kulp's voice is recognizable as the horse whom Edgar naively confesses his scheme to, and there are other familiar voices as well. Disney as a studio would continue to make animated films over the next decade, and other than just being moderate hits, nothing of great importance would come along until they decided to musicalize some children's classics. But as Disney's last personally supervised animated film, ""The AristoCats"" was a footnote after 33 years of feature films that the master had his finger on. Every great Disney film needs a great villain, and in the case of the pompous Edgar, he's more of a comic buffoon than a truly evil human. He certainly gets his come-uppance, but he's basically just a gay version of Cruella de Vil from ""101 Dalmations"" and not really all that threatening when compared to the Wicked Queen, Wicked Stepmother, Malificent or later scary villains like Ursula, Jafar and Hades. This probably plays better for children than it does adults, being rather silly and juvenile in spots, but does have a few adult references that might go over the heads of pre-teen children yet be picked up instantly by grown-ups. It was great going down memory lane again with one of the few Disney animated films that I saw during its initial run, but I believe that this won't be on my repeat viewing list.",The Aristocats
4,gavin6942,Pretty Bland,6,23 November 2014,"With the help of a smooth talking tomcat (Phil Harris), a family of Parisian felines set to inherit a fortune from their owner try to make it back home after a jealous butler kidnaps them and leaves them in the country.This film may have been great in its day, but it just does not hold up well. The plot is pretty basic (almost non-existent), the characters are just average, with the male lead being incredibly sexist (and the female lead somehow enjoying it). The father of the kittens is never explained, and leads the viewer to imagine the horrible circumstances that lead to their birth...The music is alright, and the voice talent is very good (with many returning for the superior ""Rescuers""). There is never a bad time for Scatman Crothers. But the film does not age that great, and if it were to be remade would require quite the makeover for Thomas O'Malley.",The Aristocats
5,jboothmillard,The Aristocats,7,20 June 2005,"I remember seeing this Walt Disney Pictures film as a kid, and I was looking forward to seeing it again to see what I'd think, from director Wolfgang Reitherman (One Hundred and One Dalmatians, The Jungle Book). Basically, set in 1910 Paris, pampered house-cat Duchess (The Rescuers' Eva Gabor) and her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin) are loved by their owner Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley). However, when greedy butler Edgar Balthazar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) hears that they will inherit her fortune when she is gone, he kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. They need to find their way, and they have street-wise, smooth-talking alley cat Thomas O'Malley (The Jungle Book's Phil Harris) to help them. While Thomas, Duchess and the kittens hang out with the likes of Scat Cat (The Shining's Scatman Crothers) and his gang, Edgar is trying to retrace his steps and make sure no-one finds incriminating evidence. When Edgar eventually catches the cats returning home, it is up to Roquefort the mouse (Winnie the Pooh's Sterling Holloway) to get O'Malley and his gang to help. In the end, Egdar gets himself trapped inside a trunk heading to Timbuktu, Africa, and O'Malley gets to stay with Duchess and the kittens. Also starring Monica Evans as Abigail Gabble and Carole Shelley as Amelia Gabble. The animation is reasonable, but it Harris that makes this a real treat, he is just as he was being Baloo, and his co-star Gabor is a good voice too. It also that memorable jazzy song by Harris and Crothers, ""Everybody Wants To Be a Cat"" that makes it worth a viewing, it is a fun cartoon adventure. Very good!",The Aristocats
6,Tweekums,An underrated classic from Disney,9,12 July 2019,"This Disney animation is set in early twentieth century France where a wealthy Parisian woman who has decided that her cat, Duchess, along with her three kittens, Berlioz, Marie and Toulouse will inherit her wealth. They are to be looked after by butler Edgar and he will inherit when they are gone... but when he overhears this he decides he can't wait so slips sleeping pills into the cats' food and drives them far into the country. When they awaken they have no idea where they are but passing alley cat, Thomas O'Malley, offers to help them return to Paris. Along the way home they get into a number of scrapes as well as meeting a pair of helpful geese and O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his jazz playing associates. While this is going on the cats' friend Roquefort, a mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse learn what happened and Edgar realises he has left potentially incriminating evidence in the countryside.I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but since Disney rarely disappoints I decided to give it a go. I'm glad that I did as it was a lot of fun. The story provided plenty of laughs cute characters, excitement that shouldn't be too scary for younger viewers, a touch of romance and a villain who is more comical than fearsome. The story moves at a good pace and at just under eighty minutes doesn't overstay its welcome. There are a few songs of which he jazz number 'Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' was easily the most entertaining. There are plenty of amusing moments; my favourites involve Edgar and two hounds he has trouble with in the countryside. The animation is really good with beautifully detailed backgrounds and fine character designs. The voice cast do an impressive job of bringing the characters to life. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching for fans of Disney or of animated films in general.",The Aristocats

8,moonspinner55,"Fine Disney animation at odds with slapstick treatment, mundane script...",4,19 October 2007,"A French feline and her three kittens are cat-napped by the scheming butler of a wealthy Parisian Madame; enter a ""hep cat"" from the wrong side of the tracks. 1962's independently-produced ""Gay Purr-ee"" was groovier, and Disney's own ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""101 Dalmatians"" covered this ground (with dogs) with much more spirit--not to mention better songs--so ""The Aristocats"" was already second-best on three counts: story, presentation and music. The movie is at odds with itself over how far to go with its comedy: at one point, the butler on his motorcycle drives into the base of a windmill and moves the structure a few feet before crashing through the other side. It's Saturday morning TV slapstick, lumpy with comic relief that might only tickle indiscriminating children. ** from ****",The Aristocats
9,michaelRokeefe,Not the usual Disney instant classic.,7,28 February 2015,"Think: feline version of LADY and the TRAMP. Usual entertaining Disney animation feature; but not the instant classic as so many during Walt Disney's lifetime. (I believe this is the first completed feature following his death.) Grand, beautiful and pampered pussy Duchess(Eva Gabor)leaves all her earthly possessions to her three kittens in her will.(Duchess might have really made the rounds by looking at her three different looking offspring.) A clause states whats left of the fortune goes to the butler Edgar(Roddy Maude-Roxby)in the event the cats don't survive. Greedy Edgar dumps them out in the country in hopes they will never find their way back home. But coming to their aid is alley cat Thomas O'Malley(Phil Harris).ARISTOCATS is family fun with high quality cinematography and directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. Maurice Chevalier sings the title song. And Harris sings a tune called ""Thomas O'Malley Cat"". A diverse group of actors lend their voices to supplement the cast: Sterling Holloway, Pat Buttram, Nancy Culp, George Lindsay, Scatman Crothers, Lord Tim Hudson and Hermoine Baddeley.",The Aristocats
10,Bunuel1976,"THE ARISTOCATS (Wolfgang Reitherman, 1970) ***",7,15 January 2009,"Walt Disney's 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output. The main problem is that, on the surface, the film seems merely to be the feline version of either LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961) both of which are certainly more beloved by fans Even so, being both an animation and cat lover, I dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of Paris by a wealthy lady (Hermione Baddeley)'s greedy butler. Luckily, they meet a streetwise alley cat (Phil Harris) who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs; meanwhile at home, Edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets. Legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in French) and Scatman's band indulge in a breezy number ""Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat"".",The Aristocats
11,grantss,Kids will love it,6,25 August 2014,"Kids will love it, but adults might find it so-so. Not anywhere near as good as Wolfgang Reitherman's previous movie, The Jungle Book. Story is quite basic, even dull at times. Music is okay but not great. Certainly not in The Jungle Book's league.This said, it has many sweet moments. It is shortish - 70 minutes long.Animation is also different to The Jungle Book, though this is not necessarily a bad thing. Here the animations seem more like water colour paintings than cartoons, which gives the movie a more artistic impression. With Paris as the setting, it works well.Voice performances are good, and well-cast. Phil Harris, who played Baloo in The Jungle Book, is back, as O'Malley The Alley Cat, and does a great job.",The Aristocats
12,view_and_review,Clap for the AristoCats,7,5 July 2020,"Not that I'm a Disney buff or Disney connoisseur, but I'm surprised I hadn't seen this movie before. More still, I'm not even familiar with it. There are many Disney movies that I haven't seen, though I've heard of them.""The AristoCats"" is more like a feline version of ""Lady and the Tramp"" IMO. The wealthy cats, with Duchess (Eva Gabor) being the matriarch, were dumped in an unsavory part of France as a means of preventing them from inheriting the riches of their owner. There, Duchess met an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris) who was from a totally different world than she.""The AristoCats"" is a little funny, a little lively, and doesn't get nearly as dark, down, or depressing as some of their newer films. They always end on a happy note, but it seems nowadays they have to take the viewer about as low as possible before raising their spirits. The cats hit low, yes, but they stayed just above saddeningly low.",The Aristocats

Edgar the greedy butler doesn't much care for this news so he kidnaps the feline family and abandons them in the country. Duchess the feline mother and her three daring children are eventually joined by an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley. Simple plot and very undemanding with a slapstick violent climax common in these films. One must question the mental stability of a person who leaves her estate to animals. Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman with dazzling colorful animation. Eva Gabor voices Duchess, whom like any mother cares for her children and their safety. Phil Harris voices Thomas O'Malley who is a rather simple character with an uplifting attitude that churns romantic vibes at Duchess. Scatman Crothers voices Scat Cat who leads his Jazz playing band of cats that sing ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat."" He will be recruited by O'Malley to fight against Edgar. Sterling Holloway voices a loyal mouse whom assists the cats. Roddy Maude-Roxby voices the villain butler Edgar who provides some humour with his downfall.

16,StevePulaski,Sweet without being to saccharine and romantic without being too mawkish,8,1 March 2016,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Lizz Rutter for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" Disney's The Aristocats is such a charming, almost compelling story that I wished the narrative didn't need to interrupt itself so sporadically with jazz-fueled musical numbers amongst not only cats, but dogs and a variety of other animals. The musical interjections, that push this Disney film over the edge into being a full-blown musical like most of their films in this respective era, unfortunately disrupts the magic these feline characters manage to conjure up when they are just trying to sift their way through their poor circumstance.The result, as one can expect, is a film that you say ""aww"" to over a dozen times and a film that has you either tapping your foot or rocking your legs in melodic harmony with the music. The Aristocats is a simplistic story, concerning a wealthy woman named Madame Adelaide (voiced by Hermione Baddeley) in 1910 Paris that has just signed a will granting her lavish estate to her cat Dutchess (Eva Gabor) and her three kittens. This move greatly upsets her jealous, hot-headed English butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), who has slaved away at serving Madame Adelaide for years and has ostensibly gotten nothing in return. As a result, Edgar conjures up a plan to get rid of the cats so when Adelaide dies, he can inherit the estate. He rounds up the four cats and throws them into the street, where the four homebody felines must learn to survive in order to be reconnected with their Madame.On the long, rainy, and uncertain road back home, Duchess meets a gentle feral cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who has been living off the land for many years. O'Malley is kind to Duchess, as he recognizes their predicament, but most important to note is how well he responds to her kittens, playing with them and assisting them whenever they need it. Both him and Duchess strike up an affable relationship as the gang tries to get back home, but not without a few musical numbers slowing them down along the way.The Aristocats, in a strange way, could almost be seen as a parable for single parent-dating or ""getting back out there,"" especially for a woman who has children, which is no easy process. The film showcases such a challenge with admirable conviction and a willingness to have long stretches without musical numbers or any kind of distractions in order to allow this relationship to build. For an animated film in the modern day, even some of the best ones stamped with the Disney or Disney Pixar approval can't help but feel a bit scatterbrained in some sense, stepping over their toes to try and cover all the bases in subplots, character relations, and cause-and-effect relationships that are questionably worthy of being a focus in said film.The Aristocats was birthed in a time when animation took a more relaxed and reserved approach, which is why we could see Duchess, O'Malley, and Duchess's kittens do everything from hop aboard a train to meet two snobby swans in a river below a bridge. This kind of fluid, real-time focus on the characters makes the process and narrative development all the more natural. Of course, the film cuts back to Madame Adelaide desperately trying to find her cats, along with Edgar's conniving plan to make sure the furry beasts will never come home, and the jazzy musical numbers occasionally get in the way of a film that's already extremely short (a mere seventy-eight minutes). However, nothing truly distracts from The Aristocats being simple, effervescent entertainment with a plethora of fun characters, a timely moral, and, okay, some pretty catchy jazz numbers as well.Voiced by: Edna Gabor, Phil Harris, Hermione Baddeley, and Roddy Maude-Roxby.

17,Smells_Like_Cheese,Everybody wants to be a cat!,9,1 September 2004,"AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I just loved so much as a kid. Still to this day I can't resist watching it, it's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs. I really miss the animation films like AristoCats, they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very witty and clever, the story was just so wonderful. This film is just beyond irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecio's, lol, it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting.Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children. But when the lady feels it's time to make her will, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of Thomas O'Malley, they head back home to their lady, but learn the coolness of being a skat cat.The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I feel is a bit over looked. I would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families, it could be enjoyed by anyone. The songs and story is just memorable. I will always join in for the movies best song ""Everybody wants to be a cat"", such a great tune. I also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were just so cute. This is a terrific film, please watch it, you won't be disappointed.9/10",The Aristocats
18,MovieAddict2016,If you don't love this movie you probably deserve to die.,5,15 August 2006,"I'm joking again. I actually would encourage people to dislike this film. I find it average at best. As a Disney picture, it's a shameless rip-off of ""101 Dalmations"" - only instead of dogs, it's with cats. ""AristoCATS"" -- ha, ha! How clever I wonder how long it took them to come up with that one.Basically the Disney formula is in place - animals on the run from a deranged weirdo who has a strange obsession with animals and wants them dead. In this case it's the butler of a rich woman who has left her estate and belongings to the possession of her cat upon death. The butler decides to get rid of the cat and her new kittens and then have himself be put in the will. It's actually rather dark because he kidnaps the cats and plans for them to die in the wild, but they meet up with a street cat who teaches them the ways of the ""real world."" If you think this plot is incredibly stupid and far-fetched then you are probably right. But as a children's film you can hardly blame it for being utterly nonsensical and not bearing any sense of reality.If you are a Disney enthusiast you will find something to enjoy here. Some of the musical performances are fun. But it's not a remarkable film or one that is particularly memorable from Disney's canon.",The Aristocats
19,lasttimeisaw,The AristoCats,7,29 April 2013,"A Paris-setting Disney traditional animation from 1970, THE ARISTOCATS does present a foreign-looking style of a 2-dimensional continental outlook and tell us a not-so-adventurous little vignette of a fairytale, a personification of animals (cats, dogs, a rat, a horse and geese), the story is about a gentrified quartet of pet cats (a mother with her three offering), who are outcast into the wild by a reprobate butler since they are in his way to inheritance of a wealthy Madame (the pets' owner). Soon they will meet their alleycat counterpart, a very gentleman-like one (male, of course), they enjoy a stint of adventures and a great big band revelry, then return home and sabotage the butler's scheme, easy and simple. Running within a succinct 78 minutes, this animation epitomises nearly every trademark of Disney, a children-prone narrative, an illuminating storyline, adorably main characters with quirky sidekicks, cartoony villains and most significantly an unerringly happy ending. But what's more conspicuous in this Walt Disney's last output is the music renditions, French chanson led by Maurice Chevalier's title song from the opening credits, marches with classical-adaptive show tunes and bookends with a Jazz-infused razzle-dazzle, all is done in nifty set pieces and nimble workmanship. Also the benign caricatures of bourgeois French (for example, the mother cat keeps claiming they're more than pets to their Madame, who will be totally alone in the world without them, although it may be the truth, but her tone of snobbish does niggle me quite a bit) and gormless British (the twin geese and their uncle) are simultaneously entertaining and cringeworthy. The voice cast is mellifluously solid, my own pick is Scatman Holloway's Scat Cat (a reincarnation and tribute of Louis Armstrong), while the action sequences between the butler and the two bandit dogs (Napoleon and Lafayette) are the high moment of the film, idiotic, yes, but masterfully concocted and slickly edited nonetheless, which nowadays has been substituted by grandiose spectacles in the mainstream animation branch. So, for me ruefully it has been too late to watch this film for the first time at my awkward adult age, it is pure fun but the aftertaste is also fun-sized, no soul-searching commentary could be extracted, after all, it is a bona fide Disney fare, it you dig the franchise, for sure you will like it.",The Aristocats

A family of Parisian cats are set to inherit the fortune of a wealthy Madame, but was kidnapped by a jealous butler, who left the cats in the countryside. Trying to find their way back home, the family of four encounter an adventurous alley cat, who tries to help them return home and reclaim their fortune.The setting is very upscale, as aristocracy is emphasized in this film. The animation is not as colorful or vibrant as earlier Disney films, and the plot and story are not as exciting or intriguing; it has a slow, lazy feel and pace to it. But, there are some nice action scenes, including the part where the animals confront the butler. The romance between the Thomas O'Malley and Duchess cat characters have some great chemistry. My favorite scene is the ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat"" song sequence - very catchy, jazzy and swinging of a performance!

22,Lejink,Purr-ty good,6,2 December 2012,"Yet another pleasant if less than original Disney animation family entertainment, with instead of 101 Dalmatians we get four cute cats (plus one) on the run, trying to escape the machinations of a nefarious butler who sees his way to a rich inheritance blocked by his rich mistress's preference for her cats over him.The déjà-vu feelings kick in even more with the familiar Disney vocal talents of Phil (Baloo) Harris, Eva Gabor and even Scatman Crothers taking prominence, plus even the background music has shades of ""Baby Elephant Walk"" and ""The Pink Panther"" at times, while themain ""rough with the smooth"" romance of O'Malley the alley-cat and posh-paws Duchess looks back to the studio's own ""The Lady And The Tramp"".As ever there are cute scenes involving the three kittens and a friendly mouse, some entertaining chase scenes, a nick-of-time rescue and of course a happy ending. The music is fine, especially the two big tunes ""O'Malley The Alley-Cat"" and ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat"", which gets a full jazz work-out courtesy of Crothers and band. There's even a touch of topical psychedelic colouring at one point.The animation is mostly fine, especially the depiction of famous Parisian landmarks although I detected some issues with speech-synchronisation. But yet again, Disney studios prove themselves purveyors of pleasant animated feature-fun, even if I wouldn't rank ""The Aristocats"" as best in show.",The Aristocats
23,ElMaruecan82,"I'm the reviewer, I say when the film is good ... it's good ...",8,21 September 2012,"What was with Walt Disney and cats: they are wicked and vengeful in ""Pluto's Judgment Day"", innocent and playful in ""The Three Orphan Kittens"" and ""Pinocchio"", but then you got Lucifer in ""Cinderella"" and the Siamese Cats in ""Lady and the Tramp"". Maybe it's not surprising coming up from an artist whose most iconic creation is a mouse well, whatever was between Walt Disney and cats, it thankfully ended when he approved the making of ""The AristoCats"" (he unfortunately wouldn't live up to see the film).And that's how the first film made after Walt Disney's death featured an all cats' cast, in an animal-centred world in the same vein than the previous ""Jungle Book"". Yet, despite their lasting popularity, ""The Aristocats"", ""Robin Hood"", ""The Rescuers"" or ""The Fox and the Hound"" were hardly masterpieces. Indeed, there is a reason why people talked of a Disney Renaissance in 1989 when ""The Little Mermaid"" was released. ""The AristoCats"" is entertaining and fun but it was still carrying the mark of the 60's, with that sort of sketchy animation that reminds more of an elaborated story board than a complete cartoon.Is the rough look distracting? Yes, when it does remind that Golden Age is over, that no movie would ever equal in beauty such treasures as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" or ""Pinocchio"" (or even ""Lady and the Tramp"") and maybe no, because on its own, it gives a sort of artistic touch and originality that remain pleasant to the eyes. The fact that the story takes place in Paris, circa 1910, seems to fit the draft look, as Paris must have been the most drawn town in the world. The sketches are amusedly displayed during the opening credits sequence, just like for ""Robin Hood"" three years later. This kind of experiment is risky but works if you have a good story.The story: an old aristocratic woman, Madame de Bonnefamille, decided to leave her fortune to her female cat Duchess and her three kittens Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse, If anything happened to them, Edgar, the butler would inherit the fortune. Hearing the conversation between his mistress and her lawyer, Edgar reveals his true villainous face and decides to get rid of the cats. The film is based on a true story but borrows more plot elements from other Disney classics, a villain motivated by greed although not as wicked and evil as Cruella De Vil, the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley, in fact, the whole picture plays like a feline version of ""Lady and the Tramp"" with the jazzy and swingy mood of ""The Jungle Book"".However, the deja-vu feeling operates more on the technical aspect. Many sequences notably the party with the alley cats is like shot-by-shot retaken from ""The Jungle Book""'s monkey part and the dance in ""Robin Hood"", Lady Cluck and Little John's duo is exactly like King Louie and Baloo, and Marian has the same dance movements than Marie. These lazy bits of drawings stroke me when I was a kid, now, I don't pay much attention to it, probably distracted by the memory of Uma Thurman swaying her hips like Marie during the twist dance contest in ""Pulp Fiction"" (if only for having inspired the iconic scene, ""The AristoCats"" deserved to exist). And while I'm writing, I have the catchy 'Everybody wants to be a cat' sung by Scatman Crothers in mind and the extraordinary piano falling through the building's floors and I feel like I should be more enthusiastic.Like every Disney classic, ""The AristoCats"" has a great deal of music, starting with the opening songs sung by Maurice Chevalier. I'm not familiar with all his work, but I know he's an eternal icon of the famous 'Gay Paris', (in the cheerful meaning) with his boater hat and eternal smile, he embodied this French joie de vivre and it would have been an unforgettable omission not to have him sing for ""The AristoCats"" (he sings in the French version, 'naturellement') . He died in 1972, but I hope his hardcore fans have a soft spot for his last but significant contribution to the film industry. And this is –I guess- the secret of ""The Aristocats"", its appeal relies more on the little details than the story itself, without peripheral characters, the film would have probably drown in its own cuteness.And that's why even a cat-themed film needed dogs. It's a masterstroke to have inserted Napoleon and Lafayette, one of the craziest and most endearing pairing from any Disney film. Both would be featured in two extraordinary chase scenes involving poor Edgar. When the first chase next to the old mill starts, it's the first bit of action of the film and a classic slapstick moment (with a clever allusion to ""Mary Poppins""), your trust on the film is reinforced, at the second chase, its comical repetition at best. Such simple things are essential because they establish the difference between a good film and a great film. ""The Fox and the Hound"" had a screwball chase moment too, but it involved serious characters while the goofy ones were stuck in a lousy worm-catching subplot. Comic relieves ask for exuberance, over the top and hilarious moments. Lafayette and Napoleon elevate ""The AristoCats"" into its classic status despite minor flaws.Besides, they contributes to one of the most original and memorable Disney films' endings, when the two dogs starts howling in a sort of discotheque ambiance and realizing it's the end, Napoleon solemnly declares  ""Wait a minute. I'm the leader, I say when it's the end.  (and after it bumps into his head)  it's the end"". If ""The Aristocats"" is a plate with the music as dressing, well, take Napoleon and LaFayette as the salt and pepper that gives the film all its flavor. Having said that, ""Bon Appétit""!",The Aristocats
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Jazz paws.,7,25 July 2020,"'The AristoCats (1970)' is, essentially, more of the same from Disney, as generally enjoyable as it is individually unremarkable. Don't get me wrong, it's a good time. The scratchy animation meshes well with its feline characters and the plot does a decent job of keeping you invested in its central adventure. There are a couple of catchy tunes and some fun set-pieces, too. Overall, though, the movie is fairly paint-by-numbers. It follows a group of cats who must get back to their wealthy owner after they're thrown out by a greedy butler. It feels like several earlier Disney features, with only a mild spin on the formula. It does have some slightly intriguing elements, however. For example, the baddie is somewhat meek here, his machinations never quite playing out as planned, and this is an interesting angle for such a character. He puts our heroes in genuine danger and it's enjoyable to see him eventually meet his match, but he seems rather more polite than most of the studio's other foes and, as such, is slightly unmemorable. Another unique aspect is the jazz inflection of the score, which keeps you bopping along with the incredibly colourful music sequences. As can perhaps be expected, there are some unfortunate racial stereotypes. Thankfully, these aren't dwelled upon too much. In the end, the movie is an entertaining and well-animated adventure that doesn't so much stand-out from Disney's repertoire as fit in nicely with some of its better outputs. 7/10",The Aristocats

Her nefarious, Prince Charles-lookalike butler overhears her plans and schemes to have the cats disappeared. He drugs them, for some reason, and dumps them in the countryside.

He's basically a feline Baloo. He's even voiced by Phil Harris. Along the way they meet various characters and eventually confront the Butler who plotted against them.If it sounds familiar that's because it's basically a rewritten version of Disney's Jungle Book.

Madame writes her will along with her eccentric lawyer, and decides to leave her vast wealth to her beloved cats. Her dedicated butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears this, and, outraged at being left out of the will, kidnaps the cats and leaves them stranded in the countryside. Frightened and alone, they come across a charming drifter cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who teaches the privileged cats about the joys of being a wanderer.Apart from the obvious similarities to Disney's previous efforts, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and 101 Dalmatians (1961), there are two things about The Aristocats that troubled me. The first is the plot, that paints clumsy butler Edgar as the villain. Of course, dumping a family of cats in the countryside to die isn't the nicest thing to do, but after hearing the woman he's dedicated his life to leave her fortune to a bunch of f*****g cats, you can kind of sympathise with the poor guy. The other is the ending, that sees (spoiler ahead!) lovable tramp O'Malley welcomed into the aristocracy - shiny collar and all - because it seems the upper classes just won't have any individuality in their midst.This was the final film Walt Disney greenlit before his death in 1966, and one that had five of Disney's so-called Nine Old Men on animating duties. It could be seen as one the final 'classic' animated films that Disney produced before they experienced a difficult decade or so, and it does retain that warm, familiar feeling that the likes of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) lacked (although they are certainly considered amongst Disney's best achievements). The songs are wonderful, particularly the standout Everybody Wants To Be a Cat, headed by Scatman Crothers and featuring one of Disney's funniest casually- racist characters.

Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, it features a soundtrack composed by George Bruns.We are probably facing one of the most underrated films of Disney Studios. It has a simple script, based on an inheritance dispute between a butler and a family of cats. The voice actors are good and the work of designers is great. The use of softer tones, combined with a firm but discreet pencil, make it very elegant and charming. The film has some important moral messages: the union of the family, as well as help to those in peril, are values ​​visible in the way the cats help each other. On the other hand, the adverse consequences that the butler suffers show the children the punishment for his envy and greed. In the film, the ""dating"" between Duchess and O'Malley recalls the dating scenes made twenty years earlier for ""The Lady and the Tramp"".One of the most appreciated features of this film is the soundtrack, which contains a number of interesting musical moments, from the song of Siamese cats to the song that kittens sing at the piano.

33,southdavid,And I'm Feline Good.,7,20 April 2021,"Another one from the alphabetical run through Disney Plus, ""The Aristocats"" is one that I do have a little bit of history with, in the sense I'd seen it a few times before, but remembered almost nothing about the plot. I found that, despite aging references, this was a lot of fun.Retired singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (Hermoine Baddeley) plans to leave her house and fortune to her cat Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three kittens Berlioz (Dean Clark), Marie (Liz English) and Toulouse (Gary Dublin). This is very disappointing for her Butler, Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) who had hoped to inherit the estate and indeed would, should something happen to the cats. Driven by greed, Edgar snatches the felines and releases them into the French countryside, confident that he's seen the last of them - but with the aid of streetwise alley cat O'Malley (Phil Harris) the family head back to the city.Whilst I don't have the love in my heart that I have for other Disney productions, I did feel like there was plenty to enjoy about ""The Aristocats"". I liked the animation. There's a rough, sketchy hand drawn style to the film that made up for in dynamism what it lacked in polish. The vocal performances are good, with a lot of classic Disney voice actors being utilised. Phil Harris, obviously, and Eva Gabor, who would return for ""The Rescuers"". George Lindsey and Pat Buttram would reappear in various other films, as would Bill Thompson, whose career with Disney went back as far as ""Pinocchio"". Two people leaving though would be the Sherman brothers, as the film marks the last animated Disney feature they would work on for 30 years. They left on a positive note though, convincing Maurice Chevalier to come out of retirement to sing the title song, and the whole cast to perform on the Jazzy and memorable ""Ev'rybody Wants to be a Cat"".Indeed, it's the Jazz references that age the film now, but that energy and ethos prop up a story that is perhaps a little undercooked and lacking in some more interesting beats. Compared to some of the other films in Disney's history, it's certainly not top of the tree, but as I'm finding these films are a mixed bag and so far, ""The Aristocats"" is one of the more watchable ones.",The Aristocats
34,Vartiainen,Inferior mixture,5,3 August 2015,"What would you get if you took both Lady and the Tramp and 101 Dalmatians, smashed them together and made it about cats to avoid being completely obvious about it. In a word, this movie. It has the pampered household pet meeting a scamp, it has animals being stolen for lucrative purposes, it has chases and hiding, it has a romantic moonlit night... it basically has all the good parts from both films, but because they're so obviously borrowed, you can't really get into it.The film has its upsides, though, certainly. It's a Disney film after all. The music for one is pretty sweet, with jazzy tunes and one true classic in Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat. Plus, the two main characters, Duchess and O'Malley, while painfully similar to Lady and the Tramp, are at least interesting to follow, whereas the three children have no personalities of their own, aside from one of them being a female.Furthermore, the film's plot is full of holes, the villain is one of the least interesting Disney villains I've ever seen, the film is nothing more than a sequence of uninteresting side characters met one after another, the conclusion has no stages and as a whole it simply lacks effort.The Aristocats is perfectly fine as a children's film. It's not offensive in any way, the animation is nice, the music is nice and there's no reason why your kids wouldn't love it.

'The AristoCats (1970),' directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, was the twentieth film in Disney's official canon, and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France in 1910. In the mansion of the elderly Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (voiced by Hermione Baddeley), her loving feline pets  including Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens  are the most important residents. When the bumbling butler, Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), learns that the cats stand to inherit the old lady's entire fortune, he sets about disposing of the pets, dumping them in the countryside far from the big city. Lost and confused, Duchess and her children strike up an acquaintance with a sweet-talking alley cat, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them the way home.Animation-wise, 'The AristoCats' isn't anything particularly notable, with much earlier Disney films such as 'Snow White' and 'Fantasia (1940),' demonstrating a similar, or even superior, visual style. However, the story is interesting and exciting  particularly for younger audiences, I'll wager  and the musical numbers {which I wish were more numerous} are terrific. For the sake of trivia, I'll name my two favourite songs as ""Thomas O'Malley Cat"" and ""Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat,"" the latter of which is a psychedelic throwback to the late 60s, with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colours, led by a trendy feline called the Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The family's journey back to Paris is eventful and adventurous, and we meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble {two talkative geese}, Uncle Waldo {the pair's drunken relative}, Georges Hautecourt {Madam Bonfamille's ancient but sprightly lawyer} and Napoleon and Lafayette {two dim-witted hound dogs with a hunger for the butler's rump}.",The Aristocats

Five days ago, I had the opportunity of watching this movie again in a friend's house, and I could pay more attention about the story and the similarities that this movie has with ''The Lady and the Tramp'' and also ''101 dalmatians''. The ''Lady and the Tramp'' similarity is pretty obvious: The fact that Duchess is a high society cat, identical as ''Lady'' and O'Malley is from the streets like Tramp, as well as the last scene where all the cats are together as a family and Adelaide takes a picture of them together. From the ''101 dalmatians'', The delivery van in ''The Aristocats'' is similar to the moving van in ''101 Dalmatians'', as well as the pets being stolen for the pet napper's benefit and Napoleon, a dog that seems very similar to another dog from ''101 Dalmatians''.The story is a little bit silly, in the sense of Adelaide leaving all her money to her cats a little bit ridiculous, but since it is a cartoon made for kids, we should not judge it so much. And a very cool thing: everything is hand-drawn!The plot: In 1910 France,a retired opera singer Adelaide Bonfamille, is a very rich woman who lives in a mansion with her cats( Duchess and her three kittens Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse) and her butler called Edgar. One day, when Adelaide wants to settle her will with her lawyer, she decides to leave all her money to her cats, since she doesn't have family.The problem is that Edgar hears that,and wanting the fortune for himself, he decides to get a rid of the cats, leaving them away from their home. Edgar's plan is not totally successful, since he is attacked by dogs, but he lets Duchess and the kittens in the middle of nowhere.

42,zsenorsock,Me-OW!,6,4 July 2012,"It seems like most people on this site really love this film. I really don't want to diss it, but to me there are some really great elements but they are overcome by the film's major flaws.I loved the vocal characterizations. Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, George Lindsey, Pat Buttram, Sterling Holloway, the women who did the geese, all outstanding. The animation is terrific. The journey from the country back to Paris is a series of wonderful scenes. I wish they'd concentrated more on that part.The biggest problem with the film is the villain, Edgar. Yes, he is amusing. But that's not the villain's role. Edgar is clearly playing the usual role of the villain's sidekick or goofy henchman. The villain is supposed to be something of a challenge to defeat and a real threat. Edgar is neither. So Thomas O'Malley is left with little to defeat. A hero can only be as good as the villain is bad and Edgar is too goofy to be a real threat.The Sherman Brothers also let us down. After a promising opening with Maurice Chavalier (did anyone sing this after seeing the movie? Most Sherman Brothers songs audience go home singing) we get nothing memorable. Even the ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"" is sadly, flat. Perhaps if Louis Armstrong had actually done the role of Scat Cat he might have turned it into something but instead Scatman Crothers is given the unenviable task of replacing Satchmo. As anyone, he falls short of the goal.The script also lets the Aristocats down at the oddest times. The scene where Edgar tries to get rid of the cats and faces off with Napoleon and Lafayette plays like a Warner cartoon, not Disney. There is no sense of danger or real threat to the cats. Compare this to the horror of Pinochio finding himself turning into a donkey on Pleasure Island. Then what should be a heartwarming scene where Dutchess and the kittens are reunited with their mistress is skipped entirely. That should have been a great moment in the film, instead its a hole.Again, there's much to like about this film but I think ""The AristoCats"" severely missed Walt who I can't help but think would have demanded more and made changes to bring out more of the heart and the danger that would have made this a real adventure instead of just a animated cat film for kids.",The Aristocats
43,mike48128,A Watchable Treat!,9,2 May 2020,"Which Leonard Maltin called ""forgettable""? I would put ""The Fox and the Hound"" in that category. Very fast moving and short (70 min.) Relativity non-violent, as Edgar the Butler only manages to give the cat's ""a good night's sleep"" and nothing else. Most memorable for Edgar's escapades with the two hound dogs while attempting to recover his lost hat, sidecar, umbrella, etc. so he won't be implicated in the ""catnapping"". Somewhat similar in story-line to ""101 Dalmatians"", as there is a long, perilous journey back home to safety. Cruela-De-Ville is a great villain. Even her sports car is evil. Also known for the village dog's ""twilight bark"" Great character acting, especially by Eva Gabor as ""Duchess"", the mother cat. Only a few songs, notably the well-animated musical sequence ""Everybody Want to be a Cat"". with Phil Harris and Scatman Cruthers. Also, a truly annoying song ""Cruella De-Ville"". A great ending worthy of a good Disney feature. The two bumbling henchmen never really hurt the 99 puppies. A good moneymaker, released 3 times to the theater!",The Aristocats

45,Sirus_the_Virus,My favorite of the Disney classics.,10,3 September 2009,"The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too. I'd be devastated of some old bag who I'd been working with for so many years just decides to give her will to the cats. I'd of killed them also. I don't even like cats, so I wouldn't give a damn. I think that The Aristorcats is so funny and cute. There are many characters that are hilarious, like Edgar. The Aristorcats is my favorite of the Disney classics, and that's final.

46,IonicBreezeMachine,"It's essentially a cut and paste of elements of 101 Dalmatians and Lady and the Tramp, but it's so energized and fun it's easy to overlook.",7,18 September 2021,"In Paris 1910, mother cat Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three kittens Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse (Dean Clark, Liz English, and Gary Dubin respectively) live with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley), and her English butler, Edgar(Roddy Maude-Roxby). When Madame invites her lawyer and oldest friend, Georges (Charles Lane), to discuss her Will Edgar overhears and learns he will only inherit Madame's fortune once the cats pass on. Unwilling to wait, Edgar arranges to have Duchess and the kittens drugged with sleeping pills intent on abandoning them in the French countryside. With Duchess and her kittens lost, they come across a chance encounter with wandering alley cat, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who becomes smitten with Duchess and grows to like her kittens and volunteers himself to help them back to Paris.Based on the book, ""The Aristocats"" by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, was originally envisioned as the basis for a two part episode on Disney's Wonderful World of Color where it underwent a number of revisions and versions that were rejected for various reasons before it was decided to tailor the story as an animated feature. The film upon its release in 1970 proved enormously successful with high grosses in the United States, Great Britain, and France where it proved to be the most popular film that year. While The Aristocats isn't a particularly ambitious movie, it does exude an infectious likability and energy that's hard not to get wrapped up in.At its core, The Aristocats is pretty similar to Disney's other animal based animated features, 101 Dalmatians and Lady and the Tramp, taking the comic caper plot from the former and the romance element from the latter. While both elements are integrated well together, the movie doesn't carry the same level of edge as 101 Dalmatians nor does it carry the same emotional resonance as Lady and the Tramp. While Eva Gabor and Phil Harris are both engaging leads, their romance stays at pretty much the same note throughout the entire film with even the typical third act breakup not really differing all that much in tone and execution from the rest of the film. The comedy and stakes are also pale slightly in comparison to 101 Dalmatians thanks to the movie having a villain who just isn't as reprehensible as Curella de Vil down to the fact that unlike Curella he isn't trying to kill the titular characters just send them somewhere else. While Edgar does work well as a straight man in some comic sequences, he doesn't work all that well as a villain and originally he was intended to have a partner in Madame's maid who was deleted from the script and the character might've been allowed to shine a bit more if he were part of a villainous duo.With that said the elements on display are quite good Eva Gabor and Phil Harris throw themselves into their performances, even if Harris is distractingly noticeable calling to mind his Baloo performance, and the rest of the cast is well done as well. Sterling Holloway makes an always welcome performances as Roquefort the mouse, Scatman Crothers, Thurl Ravenscroft, and Paul Winchell do enjoyable work as a ""swinging"" gang of alley cats who are friends of O'Malley, but by far the best characters in the movie are Pat Buttram and George Lindsey playing farm dogs Napoleon and Lafayette who are constant thorns in Edgar's side and proved so popular with the writing staff an additional scene was scripted to give them more to do (best decision made for the movie in my opinion). The scenes where Napoleon and Lafayette chase Edgar are expertly time with pitch perfect timing on the animation coupled with the flawless vocal delivery of both actors, with George Lindsey's utterance of alliterative ""Beddy Bye Basket"" being particularly funny.Aristocats doesn't aspire for much, but what it sets out to do it does well. With an eclectic cast of characters who are all unique and memorable, and some humorous moments that really land, it's safe to say I enjoyed my viewing. The movie doesn't match the intensity or edge present in 101 Dalmatians, nor does it match the emotional or stylistic significance of Lady and the Tramp, but it is pleasant viewing.",The Aristocats

48,Stampsfightclub,Funny if not as preaching entertaining Disney picture,7,11 January 2009,"A group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler.The Aristocats is regarded as one of Walt Disney's finest 2D animations with its charming script and cool characters, but it doesn't quite have the magic that created Snow White or the Jungle Book.The slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin.The young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry, the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with.Not the funniest Disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments, especially involving the Cats and the Dogs. The representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing.The story, after the boring beginning, is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be. There are hardly any lapses and no dull moments. The journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring, not to mention two very strange British swans.With Disney, you always get a strong meaningful message. With the Jungle Book it is where you belong, with Beauty and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. However with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing. The film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough; it seems very far fetched and irrelevant.My sister and I found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the Jungle Book cast.Despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message, this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to.",The Aristocats
49,DarthBill,Everybody Wants To Be A Cat,7,23 September 2006,"Plot in a nutshell - Duchess (voice of Eva Gabor) is the well polished single mother cat of three little kittens. When their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler Edgar when the cats pass on. Edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy Duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, Duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who did the voice of the big bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); after making a pass at Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to escort them back home, with Duchess genuinely falling for O'Malley as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and mayhem ensues, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his brother cats from the streets and Edgar. Also features appearances by British geese, American southern hound dogs (what they were doing in France is anyone's guess), a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from ""Alice In Wonderland"" (he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh) and a horse. Sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable Disney venture. Features the memorable ""Everybody Wants To Be A Cat"" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known to 1980s fans as the voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if this was being made now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the divide between well bred & well fed Duchess and the street born O'Malley.",The Aristocats
50,Animany94,Boring.,5,4 October 2017,"The older I get, the more I realise how boring and lazy this Disney feature is. I am not saying that it is plain bad, but it really is forgettable. The only thing about it I really enjoyed was the ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"" scene and Thomas O'Malley's song. Okay, when Edgar meets these dogs, things get a little exciting, but that's it. It also has one of Disney's most dull and forgettable villains in the greedy butler Edgar. Not to talk about the many of the other side characters, which are merely shown one time in the film and then oddly appears at the very end to sing ""Everybody..."". Not that the characters are all just bad or unlikeable, they are just forgettable. I felt bored by listening to their voices.Definitely not one of my favorite Disney features.",The Aristocats

52,Atreyu_II,Overlooked?,7,4 July 2007,"The 20th animated Disney classic is often criticized by many people as ""mediocre"" or poor in quality, but it is a good movie.Despite being extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest Disney classics. It is full of hilarious (some of them, hysterical) moments.Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain but a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he is so funny.Every scene with Edgar and the two stupid hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll ever see, especially the one when Edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. That is hysterical!But the classic humor doesn't just come from Edgar or the hound dogs. Other characters have their moments as well.About the quality subject, it isn't perfect, but remains on a high level. Even after Walt Disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to Walt's spirit and ""The Aristocats"" is one of those examples. They no longer make them like this!As usual, legendary Disney actors voice the characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram.The characters are generally cool: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her 3 kittens, the mouse Roquefort, the alley cats, the English geese, the hound dogs and the horse. The human characters are included as well: the eccentric and kind retired Opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the comic Madame's old lawyer Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself!About the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs such as Thomas O'Malley's theme (but I can't remember its name), ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"" and ""The Aristocats"" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example.This movie takes place in Paris (France), in the year of 1910.

53,rebeljenn,VERY Cute but poor story,4,9 November 2005,"The Aristocats is a cute Disney animation with irresistible cartoon kittens, but this film suffers from a poor storyline. Not even the cute kittens can save this film from the poor storyline. The characters are also not as memorable (and the plot not as satisfying) as other Disney films. Most of my impression of this film is from the eyes of an adult. (I wanted to but never had the opportunity to see this film when I was younger, although I probably *would have* loved it because it featured cats - instead of dogs.)

55,Mightyzebra,The main characters are lot like people - only they are cats...,7,2 March 2008,"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film. It mentions alcohol*, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack ""tresspassing"" humans and it shows a male cat called (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas) O' Malley, fancying a female cat, in a surprisingly human and adult way.As a cartoon film - or just a film in general, I feel this is pretty good quality - the storyline and characters are especially good. The film (in general) is set in France and you meet a family of cats - the mother Duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the kind (rich) old woman who adores the cats, the butler Edgar and an old man (who has CLEARLY lost his marbles) called George. The kind old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it. He is INCREDIBLY cross with this - and has an evil scheme in mind...A very cute film for every age - enjoy ""Aristocats""!*Not including ""Basil the Great Mouse Detective"" and a few others maybe which I cannot think of at the moment.",The Aristocats

61,elicopperman,"It is Pretty Meh, but It Does Have its Charm",5,15 September 2018,"This was the first ever animated Disney film to be made without Walt since his passing in 1966, although he did approve of it. However, considering the master had passed on, it also meant that those at the company had no proper direction without his involvement. This resulted in a decade and a half of films that ranged from decent to flat out embarrassing, and this film is one of them. I will admit I did enjoy the film as a child, but looking back on it, it has many noticeable problems.The biggest offense to be given to The Aristocats has to be the general setup. Considering that the cat, Duchess, and her kittens are inheriting their owner Madame Bonfamille's inheritance, it makes Bonfamille's mindset rather questionable. As for the story structure itself, it's a rather episodic format in which the street cat Thomas O'Malley helps Duchess and her kittens find their way home after the butler Edgar catnaps them, while meeting all sorts of idiosyncratic characters. These scenes can be entertaining, but they either come off as bombastic, distracting, or even unnecessary. In fact, when you get down to it, nothing of true substance happens in this film, the narrative is that straightforward.Another poor aspect of the movie is how pathetic of an antagonist Edgar is. He does accomplish getting rid of the cats, but the fact that he never once goes back to see if they're truly dead makes him rather incompetent. Had he peaked back at the cats and saw them dead from his perspective, it'd pay off better than him accidentally dropping them off and forgetting to make sure they died. Sure he does retrieve some of his own evidence, but it's only an excuse to see the dogs again, and this is where the movie gets sluggish. I know these dogs were beloved by the staff and their first appearance was very hysterical, but their second appearance just wastes time that should've been spent on Edgar realizing that the cats survived and needing to finish the job. At least it would've given the movie more suspense.Now in terms of positivity, I will admit that the film has just enough charming qualities to keep it from being bad. The most gorgeous aspect of the film is how atmospheric the French aesthetics are, with lush Parisian backgrounds and an accordion conducted score. Also, while Thomas O'Malley is similar to Baloo from The Jungle Book (down to having the same voice actor), he does make for a pretty likable protagonist with enough charisma to hold the film over. Duchess herself comes off as very polite and respectful in spite of her urgency to get back home, whilst also being very selfless and caring more for others than herself. Even the romance between Duchess and O'Malley feels very genuine from their chemistry and attractive charms alone. As for the kittens themselves, they can either be annoying from their rambunctious antics or cute from their sweat minded personas.In addition, the remaining supporting characters are kind of a mix. Roquefort is a very admirable mouse who tries to help the cats despite his size. O'Malley's cat group do serve a bigger role in the climax making them more than just comic reliefs. The geese, Abigail and Amelia, do come off as a little too giddy for my tastes, but at least they rescue O'Malley, so hats off to them. But finally, the most memorable part of the whole film is the song Everybody Wants to be a Cat. While Scales and Arpeggios and Thomas O'Malley do give decent insight to the main characters, this song is so catchy and upbeat that it really helps spicen up an already dull movie. Even though the jazzy tone doesn't fit with the film's timeline, it's still one heck of a tune that will never leave your head.In conclusion, while The Aristocats does suffer from a lack of creativity, a weak story and a few absent minded characters, the smooth atmosphere, majority of likable characters and entertaining songs do make it somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me. This is a movie you either love, hate or are neutral towards it, and while I do see why many find it to be one of the weaker Disney films, I do have a soft spot for it nonetheless. It may not be a movie I'd want to put on religiously, but if I ever wanted to see an average albeit harmless animated film set in France, I'd give it another view. Hey, at least it's better than giving your money to your cats in real life, right?",The Aristocats
62,richieandsam,"A good movie, but it was missing some Disney magic.",6,29 June 2013,"THE ARISTOCATSThis film is good, but it is not as good as a lot of the other Disney classics... but it is also not the worst.The movie is about a wealthy lady who loves her cat and her 3 kittens so much that she writes her will out to the cats. When the butler hears this, he decides that the cats have to go. Once the cats have been dumped. They have to find their way back home to Paris with the help of an alley cat named O'Malley.At the beginning of the movie, I was thinking that the animation was not as good in this one compared to some of the earlier ones.There were some great characters and some really funny moments. My favourite characters were Napoleon & Lafayette. They were funny.Some of the voice talents were recognisable instantly. Phil Harris & Sterling Holloway were the main 2 that I recognised straight away. Phil has done a lot of Disney voices... but i think his most famous was Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book. Sterling has also done a lot of voices, but I think his most famous is Winnie the Pooh.I also really like Pat Buttram's voice... he has done a few voices and every time I recognise his voice and it makes me laugh.The songs in this film are OK... they are not really as catchy as some of the other classic songs. But they got my feet tapping.I will give this film 6 out of 10.It is a good movie, but there was not really anything memorable in it.

How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse. As always, it's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the Disney magic: Phil Harris is brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is... well... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old hounds Napoleon and Lafayette into a couple of bumbling Southern-fried rednecks. Their scenes with Edgar, and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band, are classic. Most striking about seeing The Aristocats now is how deeply Disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970. Perhaps the nostalgic, dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are fussier (a pity) and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in more recent efforts such as Aladdin.",The Aristocats
69,Stompgal_87,Perhaps the best Disney film from the 1970s,9,31 July 2013,"I saw this film when it was re-released in the cinema when I was a child and I really enjoyed it then. In fact, I still enjoy it as an adult.Like most Disney films from the 1960s to 1980s, the animation style is sketchy and often flickery, in spite of it being smoother when the cat band members walk in silhouette towards the end of 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' while the backgrounds are beautifully drawn, especially the interior of Madam's mansion, the surroundings of Paris and the countryside, although the backgrounds at night are not quite as colourful as the ones I've already mentioned. The character designs are generally detailed but Roquefort was the most simplistic of them all. As for the music, most of the songs were catchy and memorable, particularly 'The Aristocats (along with the simple opening sequence),' 'Scales and Arpeggios,' 'Thomas O'Malley' and 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat,' while the background music was authentic in some parts and jazzy in others. The storyline is unique to other Disney films since nobody dies and it is not quite as bittersweet as some of Disney's earlier efforts (e.g. 'Dumbo') but it contains humour such as Edgar's use of the phrase, ""straight from the horse's mouth"" much to Frou-Frou's annoyance and the ending between Napoleon and Lafayette and the sentiment of the romance between Duchess and Thomas O'Malley. I also liked the transitions between the scenes where Duchess is concerned about Madam getting worried about her and the kittens and Madam discovering their disappearance in one scene and looking out of the window all forlorn in another. Edgar is a bumbling villain if not as sinister as the likes of Ursula, Jafar and Cruella DeVill, Madam is caring, Duchess is a doting mother, Berlioz and Toulouse are boisterous (I loved Toulouse's commando-type jumping actions) and Marie is adorable. The geese are amusing as well and Thomas is suave. I also liked the voice acting and the play fight scene between the kittens.Overall, this is a rather fun romp from the Disney Classics canon with very catchy music, appealing characters and a witty, sharp and sometimes moving storyline. 9/10.",The Aristocats

And if you love cats, you'll fall in love with Paris and the French countryside settings. And enjoy the gags and the songs...Everybody wants to be a cat here... You'll love it !",The Aristocats

72,Ginger87,I Love Those Cats,10,23 August 2004,"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old.  Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with.  I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano.  In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much.  All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw.  The Ally cat had a great voice!My favorite part of the movie is when the kittens are playing the piano. That part is adorable.  I also enjoy their journey home.  It's incredible. This is one of the best Disney films I ever saw and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it.  I give this film 10/10 stars.",The Aristocats
73,tequila101,A Little Film with Huge Hopes to Please Anyone,8,20 January 2011,"The film's story is very simple. A retired singing woman decides that when she dies, she will give her enormous fortune to her cats. Her butler Edgar isn't too happy with this and he cat naps the cats and leaves them in a ditch. A wise street cat later helps Dutchess and her small kittens to get back home safely. Nice and sound..... Not if Edgar can help it XD.Definitely one of my favorite Disney films. All the acting voices are well done, the story is short and sweet and the atmosphere of the film's premise is good at times as it changes.I've always got a favorite character in a Disney film and mine would be Edgar because he's a smart idiot who has been triggered to being a victim of not getting the enormous fortune. People see him as a villain but I see him as something else. He's greedy.All sums up. 8.3/10",The Aristocats

He did other enjoyable films like ""Jungle Book"", ""101 Dalmatians"" or ""Robin Hood"", but somehow Aristocats is the most enjoyable, even if it's very simple. It just works: We have cute kittens, we have a love story like in ""Lady and the Tramp"" in Duchesse and Tom O'Malley, we have a Mouse seeking the help of a gang of street-cats, we have two English geese on their Euro-trip, we have a delightfully inapt villain and two ferocious (if old) dogs, and we have a lot of really good songs and music and playful animation. There's simply nothing not to like about this film, and it's as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was small and saw it on the big screen. And that's the biggest compliment I can make to this masterwork!",The Aristocats
76,crosswalkx,"The worst Disney movie where Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is the real villain, I feel sorry for Edgar the Butler",1,31 August 2019,"I have seen The Aristocats and I do not like the plot, The selfish high society Duchess is a spoiled witch. She's in a way a real Disney villain. While the greedy Butler Edgar is pushed aside from her will I feel really sorry for Edgar who was just doing his job and Adelaide is ungrateful and shoves him aside.This film starts off with Madame Adelaide who plans on giving her money to her cats which is stupid and doesn't make sense as cats can't handle money or would never use it, the Butler is upset and decides to kidnap the cats and drop them off in the countryside. The Duchess meets Thomas O'Malley and falls in love.Is Duchess the cat a widow or did her husband cat divorce her or run on on her? I'm interested in her former husband cat. I did like the 3 little kittens, I liked the 2 lady geese and her drunk uncle. I didn't like the 2 dogs attacking Edgar he could've gotten into a motorcycle accident. The cats hitch a truck ride and have to get off, they fall in the river, meets 2 geese and walks all the way to Paris. They meet the homeless cats called The Scat Cat band living in an abandoned house. The Duchess and her 3 cats go home only to be sacked by Edgar who plans on sending them to Timbuktu but the mean cats gang up on him and he gets sent off to Timbuktu Africa. And the mean Madame Adelaide decides to exclude Edgar from her will and give it to the cats.Seriously how the heck are the 5 cats going to inherit her will. And why would she allow the homeless cats to inherit her mansion? Especially the scat cat gang, they would vandalize and wreck her home and make it a dump, Madame Adelaide was very selfish she only cared about herself and didn't care for Edgar the Butler. Also she really didn't care about her 4 cats, she didn't think about how they would live get their food, water, going to the bathroom, she really has neglected her kittens, Seriously her neighbors would've called the animal pound and the land estate would've taken her mansion away and give it to a different butler given this is in the 1910s.This movie needs to either be remade so Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is the villain and have Edgar actually be a hero who made bad choices and have him go to the police and file a lawsuit against Madame Adelaide for mistreatment on his job payment wages and have him take over the mansion where he can have his own pets and also maybe send some money to charity.Or this movie needs a sequel to pick up where the ending left off and have Edgar either call for help and they open up the trunk to free him or show him in Timbuktu where he's stranded in Africa and he has to travel back to France and then he could contact the Estate and have them sue Madame Adelaide for mistreatment and have her evicted or kicked out of her mansion or Edgar have Madame sent to a nursing home and the 5 cats would be homeless and would have to live at the Scat Cat abandoned house or the 5 cats would be be Edgars house pets. That would've been a better remake or sequel.Also there's the Norte Dame Cathedral which has caught on fire in 2019. There's also the Paris Tower. I did like the songs but that was about it. The rest of the movie was horrible.The original ending was horrible and it ended in a cliffhanger where Edgar is shipped away to Timbuktu, did he suffocate? Also do we get to meet African people in the village? I want to know, I definitely make a fan fiction video where Madame Adelaide is the lady villain and Edgar has to file a lawsuit against her and have the police evict her from her home. And also file a lawsuit against the Farmer dog owners who's 2 dogs attacked him. That would be a better story.",The Aristocats
77,datautisticgamer-74853,"Even I, a person who has little experience with cats, want to be a cat",7,1 May 2016,"The AristoCats is just another movie that offers a mix of charm, entertainment, and some dull, boring moments. Officially the first film of the Dark Age, there is plenty to go around for music, characters (interesting to see Duchess have a Hungarian accent, courtesy of Eva Gabor), and a workable, understandable amount of intentionally cute scenes. Despite that, there are still plenty of flaws in the story execution, in a way that my interest was swiftly dropping as a casual movie attender (I had to force myself to go through all of it as a critic). I personally found the timing of the re-engagement moments to be quite precise, with the sometimes hilarious antics of Lafayette and Napoleon hitting at the moment that I was about to get up. I might consider it a style, featuring several ups and downs to initially make the audience want to leave, but then transforming into psychological captivation. I was somewhat annoyed by this, though the movie is overall worth a viewing. It might not be suitable for those who despise cats (like Angry Grandpa), so be warned.",The Aristocats

If I see a Disney cartoon movie on the shelf, I will probably give it a skip and not watch it. So, it was very surprising that I decided to watch it for free on the television on the Disney channel. I'm only 11 turning 12, and I was a bit immature, just like any other person in between 10 and 14, however anyway, my parents wanted to watch it, and I thought, hey, why don't I? So, I watched it with my parents. Not being a fan of cats, I would of expected it to be terrible. But surprisingly, no! I have no idea why I liked it, I just did! It's one of those movies where you can't explain why you like it, but you seem to like it anyway. The movie was just really good! Although I rated it a 9/10, I actually think it should have a 8.1/10. A good classic movie, I guess. Great movie for kids. I'm settling on 8.1/10.",The Aristocats

You've seen it all before..and heard it before. But even a fairly decent cast can't elevate this up from being anything more than a piece of Disney tripe, and it's way below par in overall quality to its other out-pourings. I found it extremely boring. Recommended for the kiddies, perhaps...if you are an adult, find a good book to read instead.",The Aristocats
81,SimonHeide,"Cats, humor, jazz and a hilarious Villain.",9,23 November 2008,"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings. One of the best scene contains him being chased by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is great and like in ""the Jungle Book"" you have scenes that is almost ""musical"" in the sense that the story doesn't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance. And of course we like, that the score is quite Jazzy.And of course it's not only me but also my children who love this one.Regards SimonPs.

82,Cephyran,"Not the best, but not the worst...",8,13 September 2004,"I have to say, out of Disney's roster, Aristocats is not the best they've ever done. However, it certainly isn't the worst. The story is shallow at best, and only two tiny components stand to redeem the movie.The first is the music. I'd say the musical numbers draw more entertainment than the bulk of the film, as I can still enjoy them, even though I am beyond a juvenile age where anything colorful and loud can occupy me.The second is the pair of farmdogs. Those two are more colorful, more interesting characters than any of the cats in the movie. They give the movie an occasional comedic break it needs from time to time.Overall, I'd recommend this movie if you're trying to keep a six-year-old's attention on one thing for an hour. But as far as quality entertainment, I would recommend an older Disney film like Pinnochio, or Snow White.",The Aristocats
83,AnnieLola,Charming for most kids but a few jarring notes for adults,8,30 April 2014,"This is a pretty well-crafted film for the young and uncritical watcher, full of amusing characters, and with a villain who is not particularly scary or evil; he's almost just a victim of circumstances. I'm glad that so many people have enjoyed this film without reservations and remember it fondly. Coming to a first viewing as an adult, there were points that gave me pause.For a story set in France there seem to be rather few characters who sound French-- but I suppose the idea is that American children will more readily connect with familiar accents. Eva Gabor's elegantly Continental Duchess seems right at home, but somehow her kittens turned out pure USA. Well, these aren't the things that matter to kids.It's too bad that the period setting wasn't developed further; the music in many period pieces is inoffensively anachronistic, but putting jazz into 1910, at the height of the ragtime era, seems like a wasted opportunity. It wouldn't have been too hard to concoct a fun gang of cats who played snappy rags.Giving the 'hepcats' identities largely through nationality isn't so bad (again, not many French in this Paris), but the 'Chinese' cat?!! I know other reviewers must have commented on this notorious racial faux pas. 'Shun Gon' appears to be a Siamese, but with the squinty eyes, buck teeth and broken English more typical of a wartime anti-Japanese propaganda cartoon. He even plays piano with chopsticks, just in case we hadn't already gotten the joke about those quaint, funny Far-East types. Evidently at the Disney studio, even in 1970, all Asians were alike-- and were caricatures. How could any major organization based in California be so oblivious to the presence and feelings of the many Chinese, Japanese and Thai Californians, not to mention those living elsewhere? For shame! At least 'Shun Gon' has little closeup screen time, though his lyrics in ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"" are memorably lame orientalisms: ""Shanghai, Hong Kong, Egg Foo Yong! Hya ha ha ha ha ha! Fortune cookie always wrong! Hya ha ha!"" Well, enough about that.As an animated feature rather than a cartoon, the world of ""The Aristocats"" largely functions close to the real laws of physics, so it seemed a startling departure when the overtaxed piano at Scat Cat's jam session falls through the floor, and then each successive floor below before coming to rest. I hope that was a deserted building! (with a harp in it?) Who'd be repairing the damage? Luckily O'Malley would soon be moving out.Then there's dear Madame; she seems to have become unhinged by her experiences, for at the end she announces her intention of taking in EVERY STRAY CAT IN Paris. Yes, but-- Well, just picture it! And spaying/neutering wasn't the custom then; surplus kittens were simply put into a sack and drowned. But of course Madame wouldn't permit that. One tries to imagine the scene a few years hence...But still, for the young and uncritical watcher this is a film to enjoy. Why spoil it with too much grownup reality?",The Aristocats

86,StartingAllOver14,"A fun, cute and entertaining Cat-Classic",8,18 July 2009,"""The Aristocats"" is classic Disney at it's best. It's not considered as the ultimate Disney classic along side the more well-known Disney-films, but it's a well-made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a Disney classic. ""Aristocats"" is certainly a sure kids-pleaser, cause it has all the components for a fun kids film. I'll liked it very much as a kid. I'm not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults, who could watch Disney classics for the nostalgia sake, but I still enjoy this film as an young adult.Storywise, ""Aristocats"" may not be so complex or innovative, but it doesn't matter. This film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa, which ""Aristocats"" certainly shows. The characters make the film; they're all likable, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction with each other. The voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley and etc). A misconception could have been the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette, since they're showstoppers and haven't so much to do with the actual story, but fortunately they're fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold.""Aristocats"" is both entertaining and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. The animation style and look fits perfectly for the film's French surroundings (especially the city of Paris looks greats). The character animation and design is great. And the songs are really catchy too. My favorite is ""Scale and Arpeggios"", but the title song is a cute song, along with ""Thomas O'Malley Cat"" and the memorable show-stopper ""Everybody Want's To Be A Cat"". And the score by George Burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations.Overall, ""Aristocats"" is in my opinion the best Disney cartoon from the 70's and it's a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered. So what you're waiting for? Do your self a favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves to be in their memories.",The Aristocats

And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm. Plus, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain isn't all that scary. It's perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can't like it. If Snoop was here, I'm sure he would say the same thing. Yeah. Dig those CRAZY cats, man.",The Aristocats
89,joliefille411,As Dispirited as it is Dispiriting,4,2 July 2010,"There are days when I am convinced that the Universe knows deep down what is best for me. This was most recently evidenced when the VCR ate my copy of Aristocats and promptly died, thus taking my retrospective project hostage. Now whether it was the toxic nature of the film that killed the player or the independent actions of the player to commit such a noble act on behalf of my senses, who can really say? Nevertheless, I managed to overcome all obstacles to bare my mind one more time to the spiraling saga of the ""lost years"" of Disney.Frankly, Aristocats seems a step back (if there can be one) from its predecessors. The animation is even more scratchy: pencil lines streak the characters with unprecedented gusto. Madame holds the unfortunate distinction of being one of the ugliest drawn characters Disney has ever spewed out, though none of her costars are beauty queens by a long shot. The only really successful character is Georges because his scratchy, wavering persona works in harmony with the style.The story is a shambles as well. I can't even give the film a heads up for being in Paris, for there's nothing remotely Parisian about it with the exception of the title sequence showcasing Maurice Chevallier (who by his presence makes that the best sequence of the whole film and nothing even happens during it). It's as if all the faults of the Jungle Book were given a shot of heroin and told to run with it. Jazzy music a few decades too early and enough beatnik to make me wonder if Woodstock was happening around the corner. Everybody wants to be a cat was so terribly out of context- the strobe-lights, drum kits, scatting, drug references and occasionally raunchy (for Disney) lyrics were jarring and unpleasant on the palette. We cannot even get away from cloying child characters, though thankfully, we respect the human- animal interaction boundaries this time. I have to say the only things remotely charming in this film were the odious comic relief in the form of the country dogs and, to a lesser extent, the British geese. Two things that had absolutely nothing to do with the story, but were obvious fillers since the producers saw what was essential could in no way stand on its own.If you can't have interesting leads or music or a good plot, the least you can do is offer up an entertaining foe. However, Edgar is undeniably the worst villain in the Disney canon- not remotely clever enough to be a believable menace. Seriously- his math and reasoning aren't even junior high level, he decides to kill the cats before the benefactor even dies (therefore not only not speeding up his inheritance a minute, but also allowing her the opportunity to adopt even younger cats) and he drugs them when they would have trusted him enough to let him stuff him in a sack (as he actually DID in the last act). To top it off, he's not a serious physical threat or, especially condemning, remotely funny. Even Robin Hood managed to scrape up a villain who could do one of those!Not to say that there are no redeeming qualities. Though Everybody Wants to Be a Cat bugs me in context, it is not entirely offensive to the ears and is quite catchy. Eva Gabor and Phil Harris are great, though they were both better in other Disney roles- him as Baloo and her as Miss Bianca. Maurice Chevallier coats the opening with his characteristic lovable frenchiness- the one place that takes advantage of the Parisian setting. Speaking of settings, though the character animation was quite hideous, the backgrounds were lovely- especially at times where they became almost soggy and washed out. It is, after all, still Disney.Everybody, even manic Disneylovers, has a certain film they unleash all their scorn and frustration on. Aristocats is mine, partly because its ugly and lackluster in the long line of progressively uglier and lacklust(ier) films, but mostly because by this point it seemed like they just didn't care. Previous efforts has been misguided and faltered in some way or another, but never had there been such an obvious abandonment before, though I'll reserve my judgement on the after a while yet.Quote of the film: Uncle Waldo- ""Prime Country Goose A la Provencale, stuffed with chestnuts""...?

93,Ryan_Barbakins,The Aristocats: The Most Underrated Disney Film,8,4 August 2019,"The Aristocats is a hilarious and heartwarming Disney delight that gets a bad wrap. Maybe I'm bias because I watched this movie so much as a kid, but even as I re-watch it not, I realize just how care-free and fun this movie is.
The plot of the movie shows just that. This movie is about an aristocrat who puts her cats as her inherits in her will before her butler. Right off the bat, we see how hilariously odd this occurrence is, which makes the audience digest the movie in a lighter-tone. What I'm trying to say is that the movie knew exactly what tone to set and how to.
I find this movie much more entertaining than many older Disney movies, most likely because it nailed its comedy. It seemed to focus on using random occurrences and out of the ordinary situations to make the audience laugh ie: the dogs attacking Edgar, O Mally jumping on the ""Magic Carpet"", and the entirety of the 'Everybody Wants to be a Cat' sequence. The two dogs attacking Edgar seems to be the highlight of the comedy, not even because they are attacking him, but because they are 2 great characters put together. Their dialogue leaves you on edge and will make you to laugh out loud numerous times.
Finally, one of the greatest things about this movie is the music! The soundtrack is so catchy, and entertaining to listen to. It is defiantly a step up from Disney's older slower songs. Everybody Wants to be a Cat is by far one of the greatest Disney songs ever. It is long, catchy, exciting, and layered with sections that give the song dynamics. The lyrics are both funny, and interesting as a cat's perspective on life.
To conclude this quite possibly contriversial review, The Aristocats is a funny, delightful, and care-free Disney film that is criminally underrated.",The Aristocats

The story is good, the characters are very entertaining (all of them without any exception) and not to forget there is so much funny scenes in it (the scenes with the dogs and butler Edgar are hilarious!).

The songs, including ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"", are lively and upbeat. The voice cast is excellent, with Eva Gabor(who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney's THE RESCUERS films) as Duchess, Phil Harris(Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters.

Instead of aristocrats you get aristocats. +25 for creative movie titleThe characters are well developed and funny. Thomas O'Malley is the tramp and Duchess is the lady.

Well this movie doesn't need to be perfect unlike Snow White and Cinderella, but it's just the way I like it. +21 for animationThe plot is simple, but excellent.

101,scgary66,"Not among's Disney's very best, but still enjoyable",8,25 May 2002,"The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney himself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, I believe, the only animated Disney film since the 1940's which is NOT based on an earlier book or other work, but is rather an original story). As others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in Lady and the Tramp and the kidnapping/journey home story in 101 Dalmatians.But to overcome this flaw, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the Disney animated films of the previous 10-15 years: Phil Harris (from The Jungle Book) voicing one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film with another here with Scatman Crothers. The quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from ""Dalmatians"" (with some nice nods to French Impressionism, it appears), and the villain here (the butler) is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well. (This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats, and the butler's ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs (with great voice work by Pat Buttram and George ""Goober"" Lindsey""). The various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen ""Tramp"" and ""Dalmatians."" The cats' owner, while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in Sleeping Beauty, bears none of that character's nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous.The real strength of the film is the voice work; after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in The Jungle Book, the tactic is continued strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor (who would do a very similar character in the later film The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp. All are excellent here, particularly Harris and Gabor in the leads. The character animation is as excellent as one would expect, showing a variety of emotions well.Smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes (an escape from the path of a speeding train, a near-drowning by one of the children), but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly. Overall, there's very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other Disney classics.One minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are depicted among the jazz-performing cats in supposedly 1910 Paris; one can't help but wonder why the story wasn't set solidly in the present, other than the great deal Paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time. It really would have made more sense that way.The songs, while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed, are not particularly memorable. Nonetheless, the general energy applied here, the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses. Far from the greatness of classic ""10""s such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite up to the ""9""s one might give to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is probably a rather marginal 8 of 10; perhaps a 7.",The Aristocats
102,MyNeighborFanboy,Disney's Death Knell,5,26 October 2010,"Following Walt Disney's death, the studio was left rather lost as to  how to proceed. Though Disney relied on many deeply talented story  artists, concept artists, animators, and the like, his input had been  so tightly woven into the storytelling in Disney's work that merely his  shifting focus to other projects had caused the films to suffer.  Following his death, all the producers and director Wolfgang Reitherman  could think to do was imitate what had worked in the past.  Thus, we have The Aristocats, a straight lift of story elements from  101 Dalmations and The Lady and the Tramp that forgot to steal any of  the heart or innovation from either. The story, detailing the exploits  of a bunch of cats who just want to laze about and inherit a lot of  money for doing nothing, is unique for one reason alone. Though there  are many Disney movies in which the villain is more likable than the  protagonist, The Aristocats is the only one that made actively root for  the villain for purely moral reasons. See, Edgar, our ""villainous""  Butler, tries to do away with the cats some old hag is going to leave  all her money to so that he, the man who worked under the crazy witch  his entire life, can get some goddamn compensation. A  slapstick-triggered hitch in his plan causes the cats to be left by a  river bank instead, whereupon they jump into action and immediately  whine and cloy for a while until Phil Harris comes by and gets them to  actually do something.  And then there's lots of lame episodes with forgettable side characters  that I barely remember that mainly serve to pad out the thin plot to  feature length. Such fun moments are fine when the character is  actually entertaining, but, alas there's very little of that here  (though Scatman Crothers is always fun to watch...er, hear). The songs  by the normally exemplary Sherman Bros. are fine, but I struggle to  recall even one lyric or melody as I type this out. Anyway, Edgar gets  shipped off to Timbuktu, Phil Harris gets groomed into an aristocrat  because there's no room for individuality in the upper classes, and we  leave wanting to trample those annoying cats into the ground on our way  out.  Perhaps it isn't an AWFUL film, but it's so hard to care for the  characters we're supposed to fret for that what transpires basically  leaves us feeling like robotic husks that'll pump money into the Disney  machine even if the actual auteur himself is long gone.  Despite my indifference to the project as a whole, I was surprised to  find a few points that worked. Edgar, for all his bumbling and lack of  intimidating qualities, is great fun as a character, with some  ingenious comic animation by Milt Kahl (those who consider him a cold,  technical animator should look at this neglected piece that really  shows off the man's sense of humor). I can't help wondering whether the  story would have worked a lot better from his point of view. Kahl also  animates the Lawyer character, who doesn't get much screen time but  steals every scene he's in. Unfortunately, the other Disney animators  don't impress as much. Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, for all their  genius, really worked best when they had a good concept for a character  they could sink their teeth into. Their work here is technically adept,  but as empty as the prissy, vapid cats they're forced to work with.  There's really not much else to say. It's a safe, commercial work from  a studio trying to gather itself together after Disney's death.  Producers with far less vision began to grab hold of the animators,  cutting corners and cobbling together hackneyed concepts that would  make a buck and nothing else. There's not the amount of rampant copied  animation that there would be in the next Disney project, but the  opening credits (in which animation from the body is reused for no  reason other than cost cutting) is a grim sign of things to come.  I think it's around this point that American animation essentially dies  for years, and Disney's next project wouldn't help a bit.",The Aristocats
103,flavia_cj,"When Aristocats was made, Uncle Walt certainly turned in the grave.",1,8 May 2016,"I'll receive many fingers down, but I need to say that this is by far the worst traditional Disney animation ever. ""Oliver & Company"" (1988) and ""The Black Cauldron""(1985) seems like a ""Spirited Away"" in the side of Aristocats.The only good and inspired thing about Aristocats is the musical sequence ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"". Only this. Let's look at the rest:The characters are awfully dull. O'Malley is just a cat version of Tramp. Duchess is a sympathetic character though, but only she can't save the movie. The animation is just terrible, full of recycled scenes, and low quality xerography, compared with ""101 Dalmatians"" (1961) and ""Jungle Book""(1967). ""Robin Hood""(1973) also had a poor animation, but compensated this with a more entertaining and funny story to follow. But what's the story of Aristocats? It's a rip-off of ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""101 Dalmatians"" version cats. The plot is dull, full of random and unbearably tedious moments, like Edgar being chased by generic dogs, and the group of cats talking with annoying geese, that not even a child with 7 years would have the patience to finish watching. Do you remember Cruella Devil, a woman who wanted to kill 99 puppies Dalmatians for wear their skin? Yes, she's a true villain. But in Aristocats, we have Edgar, the most dumb villain I've ever seen in my life. Why the heck Edgar decided get rid of the cats BEFORE Madame Bonfamille die? And why the heck he gave sleeping pills to cats and went to a other place, when he simply could arrest all cats in a bag and drown them? With these questions, we can see how Edgar is a dumb villain and how fragile and nonsense is the script of this film.",The Aristocats

105,Centaurus3,1st out of 8 in the Dark Era,5,28 April 2013,"Three years after the gigantic hit ""The Jungle Book"", Walt Disney's final green-lit animated movie was released, called ""The Aristocats"". This movie is the beginning of the era where the quality and impact of the animated films went downhill, known as the ""Dark Era"".The story is very basic. An aristocratic cat owner is planning her will and writes that all of her kittens will receive her money. The butler overheads this and kidnaps the cats to put them in the middle of nowhere. The cats then have to return home.The characters aren't annoying, but they are extremely boring and cutesy. Duchess is the classy, sophisticated mother cat, Thomas is the suave charmer and an alley cat, Duchess' children each have a talent; the red one can paint, the black one can play jazz music, and the white girl kitten can sing and is exactly like her mother. Edgar is the silliest villain to come out of Disney. The characters could have been extremely likable, but there is not enough time for their personalities to show and expand on.This soundtrack also has a jazz-like theme to it. Most of the songs are not that memorable, except for ""Everybody Wants to be A Cat"", which is a fun, catchy song. The title song does not really stand out, and ""Scales and Appegios"" is a cute song.Th xerography in this movie looks really bad. You see the sketch marks on every frame, and they don't even try to clean up and polish the sketchiness. Some of the characters movements Re very choppy, and the entire film looks extremely cheap. This is one of WDAS weakest animated films, but not the worst.With thin and boring plot and characters, one memorable song, and bad animation, this is one of the weaker movies in the canon. Adults and kids have a big chance of getting bored, but if you want a cutesy kids movie, this one you might like.",The Aristocats

107,wildanimals,Hard not to like,7,15 April 2008,"After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak. The animation and backgrounds are a bit scratchy in places, typical of Disney's 70s films, but it does have a rustic, old fashioned charm about it.The Aristocats strongest points are the characters, the music and the humour. The music is very memorable - try getting 'Everybody Wants To Be A Cat' out your head in a hurry! The songs are written by the Sherman Brothers, who also did the music for The Jungle Book. There was one song called 'She Never Felt Alone' that was going to be in the film, but sadly didn't make it into the final feature. It is a shame, because I think it would have fit in very well.The characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris, and is basically Baloo in a feline form. Eva Gabor gives Duchess this warm and maternal feel and the kitten's voices actually sound like children, and not an actor imitating the voice of a child. The secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities. Edgar, the 'villainous' butler plays a similar role to Cruella De Vil, but he's more comical than scary, often ending up in funny situations. Even though he's the bad guy, he's still lovable all the same.The two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really had me cracking up, along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like the dogs, who tend to argue over who is 'the leader.' I could go on, but I won't spoil it. But I can tell you, The Aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humour.The bottom line - The Aristocats might not be Disney's crowning achievement, or even their strongest film from the 70s (that award is a tie between The Rescuers and The Many Adventures of Whinnie the Pooh). But it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain. If you are looking for a dazzling work of art, you might be better off watching Bambi. But if you want a fun night in, The Aristocats is the way to go. It is a charming and lovable film and it's impossible to dislike. Enjoy! (And besides, it's good to have a film where cats aren't seen as the villains).",The Aristocats
108,guyincognito1,Possibly one of the best Disney films ever.,9,21 January 2012,"This is a film that is incredibly underrated. At the tender age of two, I went through a fanatical phase of watching The Aristocats again and again, at least twice a day; a craze that still makes sense to me now. This is an incredibly simple storyline that works wonders with both kids and adults, and I was shocked to learn that it was only given 6.9 on this website (IMDB), rated lower than The Fox and the Hound, which is nowhere near as brilliant (despite still being good). Although some of the elements hark back to previous Disney hits, the ideas (for the most part) remain original and very enjoyable. Phil Harris, who also lends his dulcet tones to Little John in Robin Hood, and Baloo the Bear in The Jungle Book, plays the classic low-born hero in this romantic journey of self-discovery and fighting to get back home. It is also very funny, with the three main comedy characters (Napoleon, Lafayette and Roquefort) being excellently distributed throughout the film. In addition to this, the evil character, in this case a resentful butler, is not too scary, and has just the right balance of maliciousness and humour. The addition of swing to the ensemble makes this a film that few can rival. The originality of Cats (universally cute creatures) in Paris (a centre of romance and culture) is unrivalled. 'Everybody wants to be a cat'? After that, I certainly do!",The Aristocats
109,zillion29,Probably One of Disney's Worst Features,3,22 February 2008,"This movie is disappointing on so many levels. Much like the more recent Ratatouille, it seems to be a children's film hijacked and saddled with a slew of themes and environments better suited for octogenarians. Even in 1970, I doubt there were many 5 year olds who ached for jazz-loving bohemian cats in belle epoch Paris. It is immediately apparent that the Disney folks (on their own for the first time since Walt croaked) were lost - it takes almost 8 or 9 minutes for ANYTHING even remotely interesting to a child to occur. A five year old will be ready to leave before the disc has been spinning more than a few minutes. And it never goes anywhere. It never really tugs your heartstrings and instead wallows in this strange slapstick humor that undermines the drama. Perhaps most disappointing is the quality of the animation. It sports a rough look - almost like they just took practice sheets and frantically turned them into cels. You can practically see the pencil lines appearing.

Don't let the sweet, playful cats fool you into thinking the movie's for the little ones. Everyone will enjoy it. One of the movie's best qualities is the characters.

Eva Gabor's sweet, soft-spoken, accented voice is a perfect fit for the refined Dutchess. The kittens, while voiced by less famous people, definitely don't fall short; their voices to enhance their characters, from prissy Marie, too tough-guy Toulose, to musical Berlioz. Napoleon and Laffayette are hysterical.This movie is a musical jam-packed with catchy songs. ""Thomas O'Malley"" and the instant classic "" Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"" are timeless songs with swinging lyrics and rhythm.

112,annekehensley,"Cute and nostalgic, but not Disney's best classic",7,13 June 2019,"Yes, I know, this was a different time period and movies since then have gotten substantially better, but I still want to be blunt: The AristoCats isn't the best that was there. I LOVED it, don't get me wrong, all the songs and characters were adorable and I had a great time throughout. But it feels less like a movie and more like a really long, entertaining but otherwise silly cartoon.The entire time, I would think about how these scenes in the movie all sort of felt ""looney-toon-esque,"" dare I say it, and while that isn't a bad thing in the long run, it does affect how the movie portrays itself. There's not too much of a message, there isn't many heart-gripping or tense scenes in the movie, and its not overly complicated in terms of plot. But its cute! And its fun, great for kids, and is totally fine to watch as a quick period of entertainment. Again, its like a really long cartoon, and thats fine.But lets be honest, there are better Disney classics out there. This movie is similar in plot to Lady and the Tramp, a movie I'd much prefer over Aristocats any day (no offense, kitties), and there are also movies like Dalmations and the Lion King and overall handfuls of 2D animated classics that outrun Aristocats by miles.

This movie sincerely misses Walt Disney, it seems like a failed copy of what the creators believed Walt would do. It pulls from 101 Dalmatians but misses the creativity and effort put behind that film. The film contains poor characters without any distinctive qualities. The story itself is bland and already done better in 101 Dalmatians. Thomas O'Malley is a clear Baloo recreation. The Villain has bland motivation and comes off as incompetent which doesn't match the characters deviant actions. I found the scenes containing Hautecourt and Lafayette were the most enjoyable parts of the film. These are the only scenes containing any energy and excitement.

123,Michaelnafekh,"""It isn't Beethoven, mama, but it sure bounces!""",7,10 October 2013,"Berlioz said it right! Though this movie was not-by any means-the best movie Disney has come out with, it definitely had a sort of bounce to it that kept me until the end- even going to the extents of making me consider watching it again! Though the story line was rather linear and predictable, the events that transpired along the way, coupled with a lovable set of characters and some great tunes, kept things lively. However, if I was rating this movie for its characters and music alone, I'd have given it more then 7/10. The only real drawbacks to this otherwise wonderful film can be found in two main areas: The animation and the mediocre child singers. The animation was a bit sketchy throughout the movie, especially when it came to moments of action and close ups. I am aware, however, that this was originally created in the 70s, a time when the traditional, hand- drawn methods were prevalent. This does not excuse the artists behind the less than satisfactory performance, however, especially when it's compared to the stellar performance, say, of the Fox and the Hound and Bambi.Moving onDisney has a good reputation for some pretty amazing child singers, so I was disappointed by the ones in The Aristocats. Sure, they were excellent voice actors, but the same praise cannot be given to their singing, butchered further by the lower quality audio recordings of the time period. With that in mind, however, the adult singers in the movie were ear candy. But now, onto the good stuff!Maybe it was because of their diverse accents, but I must admit, each and every character, whether they be primary, secondary, or just tagging along for the ride, were portrayed amazingly. Though the majority of these characters were cut-and-paste stereotypes, their dialogue kept them afloat. With that in mind, however, there is some racial stereotyping, so if you're easily offended, don't watch this movie! Normally, I dislike static characters, but because their script was so cleaver and natural, I found myself laughing at their clichés instead of weeping, which is a good thing! Secondly, the music-heavily inspired by swing and jazz-was exceptional, and the song 'Everybody Wants to be a Cat' will most defiantly be stuck in my head for days to come. The overtures and subtle orchestral pieces residing or bridging each scene-living up to Disney's unprecedented standards-were top notch as well!And that concludes it!

The writers/producers/director completely nailed this one.....yeah, nailed it to the wall.xoxo~Wolly~xoxo",The Aristocats
125,Stormsheep,Review number one,6,27 April 2020,"Disclaimer : I'm French and I want to improve my English skills. So I write reviews about the movies or tv shows I watched recently or not. Don't hesitate to correct me. It would be a great pleasure to read you and improve my written.Before to watch this Disney movie I just listened few musics of this on Youtube. That's why I already knew few characters like Berlioz or Marie, but I didn't know the ins and outs of the story.I really be surprised of the quality of this 70's movie. I didn't feel the time passed, the eighty minutes was very fast. The main characters Berlioz, Toulouse, Marie and Duchesse were adorable. You don't want that they suffer and you don't understand why the majordomo was jealous about them.Okay, there was an inheritance in stakes but I think it's a too easy problematic for the movie. To my point, the characters were not develop enough and the story is most destined to a child public.All in all, it's a good movie that you can watch rapidly and easily with kids, but if you didn't already watch this movie I don't recommend you to watch The AristoCats alone.Thank you for you attention.",The Aristocats
126,ebersocats,It's a charming animated motion picture especially for cat lovers.,10,18 May 2003,"I really enjoyed this movie and I usually don't like animated pictures. But I thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming. There is a good song called ""Everybody wants to be a cat,"" that is a lot of fun. It has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film.",The Aristocats
127,AlwaysBelieve,Hugely Underrated,9,20 November 2009,"I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind. The music is superb - my disabled son always insists that I lift him up and dance with him to ""Everybody wants to be Cat"" this says it all. And ""Thomas O'Malley"" is just as enjoyable.I'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats! And yes, it does take a few of its cues from ""101 Dalmations"", and maybe ""The Lady and the Tramp"" (It's been a long time since I've seen that, so I'm not going to compare them), and while ""101 Dalmations"" is better in some ways, for me ""The Aristocats"" is far more enjoyable. Isn't that what these films are about? Apart from ""Peter Pan"" (now that is a 10/10 film), this is my favourite Disney film. My 7 year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film.Superb!",The Aristocats
128,basilfan,Cute & fluffy film.,9,17 February 2004,"Engaging characters, nice animation, dynamite songs...all this and cute kitties, too. There's a lot of excellent humor, but no real menace, so don't worry about your little ones. The two farm dogs steal the show, even though they only appear in two scenes. The artwork has a linear quality that may put off some people, but I find it charming.",The Aristocats
129,xareereyes,The Aristocats,9,14 October 2015,"The movie The Aristocats is great movie. Its the theme is mostly adventure. There is the mom Duchess with her three little children Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz. Edgar the butler, makes them fall asleep with some medicine. Then proceeds to take them away but in the process drops them trying to escape some dogs. The basket of cats falls near a stream by the bridge. Once awoken they hid in the basket, while it rains. I'm the morning they meet Thomas O'Malley. He agreed to help them get to Paris. Other than helping them, Tomas saved the children a few times from being left behind, drowned, or falling off of something. When they were getting close to Paris they started liking each other more. Duchess was sad she could not bring him but Madame would be worried. My analysis is that this is an perfect example of how good is at work in this greedy world. It also gives an example of that a very kind person would help. But in real life there are very few people that would do that. Most people would be like the butler and throw the kittens out just so they could inherit some money. It an example of the trials of life. The cats have to go thought some complicated stuff to get to Paris but they also make some great memories. I really think this is a good movie it has a lot of hidden messages that different people will get out of it. It's so kind how some they meat would help them and show them parts of the world they haven't seen",The Aristocats
130,Chaimster,Not entirely worthy of the Disney moniker,6,19 August 2005,"The Aristocats is at once arguably one of the last great Disney animated features. It too can be seen as a harbinger of the likes of Fritz The Cat. However aside from O'Malley's swooning for a hit of that ""sweet stuff,"" and his off screen roll in the hay with Duchess punctuated with ""what a finale!"" this film lags behind its predecessors both narratively and artistically. There is some very nice background art. The animation style is often just above a pencil test and while it aesthetically hearkens to 101 Dalmations, there's no real over-stylized flamboyance or flair that Dalmations toyed with so beautifully. While the two hounds are culturally out of place (hobo southerners in the middle of the French countryside?) they do demonstrate some of the best animation in the film, with nice attention to volumes and follow through of movement. There is otherwise some rather untidy treatment of ink and paint here, and not just that which could be chalked up to a matter of style but rather, well just sloppy. A couple walk cycles have the characters so against-the-animation-rules gliding along, completely ignoring the rhythm of their gate. The musical numbers seem more of an excuse to have fun on screen than serving to carry the narrative along in any meaningful or for that matter, useful way.",The Aristocats
