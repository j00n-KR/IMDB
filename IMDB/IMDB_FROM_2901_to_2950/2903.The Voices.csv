0,SnoopyStyle,black comedy with no big laughs,6,28 October 2015,"Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) is a seemingly happy guy in the town of Milton. Dr. Warren (Jacki Weaver) is his court-appointed psychiatrist. He likes Fiona (Gemma Arterton) from work but she doesn't like him back. The problem is that he sees things and hear voices from animals. He's delusionally obsessed with Fiona but Lisa (Anna Kendrick) is the one who actually likes him.Reynolds gets to play an odd guy. He has an opportunity to play a truly scary guy but he doesn't do that until the end. This is a lot of quirky black comedy but not actually funny. It could be a horror but it's not anything scary. If Reynolds plays him more quietly, he could be scarier and intensely creepy. The animals and the talking heads could also be weirder. It has some interesting quirkiness but it could be better. It has to choose to be either truly quirky like the closing credits or be an odd quirky scary horror.",The Voices
1,Prismark10,Pet Sounds,6,23 June 2019,The Voices is a black comedy/horror film about mental illness and not taking your medication.Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) is an upbeat nerdy guy working at a factory in a small town. He has had disturbing issues in his childhood. He needs to see a psychiatrist Dr Warren (Jacki Weaver) and take his medication. Failure to do so is a breach of his release orders.As Jerry is not taking his medication he can hear voices from his pets. Mr Whiskers the sinister cat and Bosco his docile dog. When Jerry takes an English expat Fiona (Gemma Arterton) to dinner he accidentally runs over a deer and then accidentally kills Fiona.Unfortunately Jerry cuts up her body and puts her head in the fridge. Jerry hallucinates Fiona's head talking to him and she demands a companion in the fridge. Now Jerry has an eye on Lisa (Anna Kendrick) who has a crush on Gerry. Pretty soon the heads in the fridge mount up.Jerry mostly sees the world in a demented clinical way. Bosco acts as his conscious. It is only when Jerry takes his pills that he sees his scuzzy blood soaked flat with rotting flesh.The Voices is a grotesque offbeat dark comedy/horror hybrid. Reynolds cannot pull of being the weird nerdy guy convincingly. He also provides the voices of his pets. He actually does a good Scots accent.The film tries too hard to be quirky and I thought it had an unsatisfying conclusion. I also found the violence misogynistic. All the violence is against women. It did at least provide an insightful look at a possible outlook of a serial killer.,The Voices
2,nogodnomasters,MY CAT MADE ME DO IT,6,6 December 2018,"Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) works in a small town factory. He is an outsider to the group, but well liked. He also hears voices, mostly from his pets, when he is off his medication. Jerry likes the voices and prefers to be off of his meds. Jerry likes Fiona (Gemma Arterton) who doesn't return the love. Jerry however is like by Lisa (Anna Kendrick) which would have been my first choice.The movie starts out pretty decent, with Mr Whiskers catching the best lines. However, it is Ryan Reynolds and once the film gets past the point of no return , the black comedy drops off at a point where it should pick up.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",The Voices
3,kosmasp,I can hear them too,10,31 December 2014,"Well only those in the movie that is of course. Not reading about them or the movie as is my usual procedure, for better or worse, before watching a movie, proved good for this one. To say this was a surprise would be an understatement, even though we got told that the movie was received very well in other cities where the Festival went before coming to our town. A promise kept in that case.We have a weird sense of humor and it's really dark. You might not like that sort of ""comedy"", but if you do, you will cherish and love this. There is no denying that this is unique and the character (our main protagonist), is somewhat likable ... which is key to the movie. But even if you don't like him (ever/from the start), the movie offers a lot for you to enjoy",The Voices
4,gavin6942,Fairly Amusing Horror-Romance,6,8 January 2015,"Likable Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) stumbles innocently into the role of a killer, guided along the way by his evil talking cat and benevolent talking dog.Reading other reviews, you will find words like ""genre-bending"" or ""a mess"", and indeed, the film is a bit uneven. The tone shifts a bit here and there, though it really is not all that bothersome and others seem to complain too loud.Although Gemma Arterton has been great in the past, she just does not make the character of Fiona even remotely likable. She is supposed to be the love interest of Jerry, but there is just nothing about her that suggests chemistry. Anna Kendrick, on the other hand, is excellent, and it is great to see that she has been maintaining a high profile after ""Up In The Air"". She might have been the only actor to escape ""Twilight"" unscathed.Reynolds should be praised for his range of voices (the cat sounds like Craig Ferguson and the dog sounds like Gary Busey). This could have been a weak point, but he instead elevates it to the next level. He also has the right personality to take a story that seems to combine the Son of Sam and ""Master and Margarita"" and make it fun.If nothing else, there is a Chinese Elvis, and this may be the only movie able to claim that.",The Voices
5,paul_haakonsen,Pretend everything's fine...,6,6 June 2016,"While I can't really claim to be a fan of Ryan Reynold's and his later work with all the superheroes and stuff, then I still decided to sit down and watch ""The Voices"". Why? Well, it was the cat that made me do it! No, seriously, it was the trailer for it, which seemed interesting.And the movie proved to hold up to the promise of the trailer in every sense and then some. Because ""The Voices"" turned out to be a wonderfully enjoyable dark comedy with a morbid and pseudo-gory twist to it. And this weird combination at the hands of director Marjane Satrapi turned out to be a creative force to be reckoned with.The story is about Jerry (played by Ryan Reynolds), a social misfit of sorts who is living isolated and alone, with only his cat and dog to keep him company. He is deeply traumatized by a childhood event revolving around the death of his mother. When Jerry stops taking his medication, he is empowered to do things prior prohibited to him, but it comes with a price; his dog, Bosco, and cat, Mr. Whiskers, are talking to him.There is a good amount of dark comedy to the story told in ""The Voices"", and it does have a macabre enough twist to it that it actually caters well enough to fans (like myself) of the horror genre. However, it is the phenomenal performance of Ryan Reynolds here that really carries the movie, and also the fabulous dialogue throughout the movie. Especially the cat, Mr. Whiskers, he was just all-out-hilarious.""The Voices"" is somewhat of a different movie, and it may not fall well in everyone's liking. I, however, enjoyed it and found it to be every bit as good as I had hoped it would. ""The Voices"" is a movie that I can strongly recommend that you take the time to watch, especially if you enjoy dark comedies with a hint of the macabre and grotesque.",The Voices
6,grantss,"Great - dark, edgy, thought-provoking and sad",8,23 June 2016,"Jerry works in a toy factory in a small town. He is incredibly nice but this exterior hides a few dark secrets. He has mental issues and was committed to an asylum for several years. The mental issues manifest themselves mainly through him hearing voices - his cat, Mr Whiskers, and dog, Bosco, talk to him. Until now, this has not resulted in any problems for him, but the cat is quite malevolent. Then he gets stood up on a date, with catastrophic consequences.Billed as a comedy, this is hardly that. It is quirkily funny at times, especially in the cat's dialogue, but this is a secondary feature of the movie. At its heart it's a dark drama, a look into the mind of someone who is not mentally stable. His intentions are good but the voices, representing, in the case of the cat, the worst parts of his nature, drive him to do bad things. Quite sad too, seeing how someone can be driven to evil deeds by inner forces that he doesn't fully understand and can't control. All the time he is doing these deeds, you sort of feel sorry for Jerry.Great work by Ryan Reynolds in the lead role. He is solid as Jerry but then also provides the voices of the cat and dog, and that is where he shows great talent. I would not have known it was him unless I saw it in the credits.Good support from Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick, Jacki Weaver and Ella Smith.",The Voices
7,view_and_review,Strange Movie to be Appreciated,6,12 February 2016,"""The Voices"" has nothing to do with Usher, C-Lo and singing contestants. It has everything to do with a Donnie Darko type character named Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) whose cat and dog speak to him. To use a non-technical term: he was nuttier than a fruitcake.The movie was a strange one. Jerry is an affable character that seems harmless enough but he can't help but make the wrong decisions due to the voices. Because he seems so innocent and kind you want good for him but you also realize that he's a danger to himself and everyone else. It's such a vicious dichotomy: A.) allow this lovable guy who's been dealt a bad hand to live out his life. B.) lock him up ASAP.Ryan Reynolds does a good job playing the pill rejecting, court therapist seeing guy that's seeking to be normal. The setting, the small town of Milton, is very cozy and perfect for this movie. There is some real unexpected humor in the movie, primarily from the cat. Ultimately the movie is about dealing. We all have voices--positive, negative, indifferent--but for the majority of us those voices come in the form of thoughts that must be weighed using the balance of our good judgment. Jerry has lost that ability and the thoughts become audible voices that are given complete authority over him.It is a strange movie that has to be appreciated for its strangeness.",The Voices
8,deloudelouvain,"Ryan Reynolds nailed it here, very enjoyable movie, much better than expected.",9,20 August 2020,"To be honest I didn't have high expectations for this movie as Ryan Reynolds isn't my favorite actor but credit where credit is due he nailed it here, in fact I thought this was his best performance yet. To my surprise he did all the voice-overs, I would never have guessed that (I even waited for the end credits to clarify who did the voices for Mr. Whiskers, Bosco (voice), the deer and the bunny monkey). The conversations between him, his cat and dog were hilarious, much better than the usual speaking animals we sometimes get. The story itself was also very good, nothing beats a good story about a schizophrenic. It was interesting to follow, with some good humorous moments and some bloody gory parts. It's a dark comedy, one of the better ones if you want my opinion. Anna Kendrick and Gemma Arterton were the eye candy of this movie, both have a funny bone and added something special to this comedy. So if you like to wander in the mind of a schizophrenic combined with some humor The Voices will definitely suit you. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and will for sure watch it again in the future.",The Voices
9,KineticSeoul,"Not much black comedy, but still worth a watch",6,12 August 2015,"This is a alright black comedy that revolves around a psychopath named Jerry played by Ryan Reynolds. The guy is going to nail it as Deadpool in the upcoming Marvel movie. This isn't a laugh out loud black comedy, but it does have that comedic vibe going for it. Mainly because of how the characters act, the cinematography and vibe. So the plot is about this really likable and nice guy that hears voices from dogs, cats and from dead talking heads. The film almost feels like it's looking through the head of a psychopath serial killer in this lala fantasy world. This film actually shows the mindset of sane people as well, because reality can be tough to handle for anyone sometimes. And some may need a vice to cope with that before coming back to reality. Ryan Reynolds did a really good job portraying this socially awkward oddball that goes on a psychotic meltdown. The character might be a psychopathic killer but he is a killer with a consciouse. I am not sure if this fits as a comedy (maybe diabolical humor), it just doesn't go in a overly serious direction. The writing is pretty decent and Ryan Reynolds makes this film work, it just didn't have that uncomfortable humor I was looking for. When it comes to mentaly unstable serial killer films, this one doesn't really stand out all that much whe it comes to the plot. However the way it transition from the lala world to reality and blending of it together was done in a quite unique fashion in this. It's a concept that has been done before but I did like how it was done in this film. I am now looking forward to the Deadpool movie mainly to see how Ryan Reynolds plays the crazy merc with the mouth.6/10",The Voices
10,Hellmant,"The highlight of the movie, is Ryan Reynolds' performance.",8,27 March 2015,"'THE VOICES': Four Stars (Out of Five)A dark comedy/thriller starring Ryan Reynolds as a schizophrenic (but extremely upbeat) man, with an office crush; that goes disturbingly wrong. The film also costars Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick and Jacki Weaver. It was directed by Marjane Satrapi and written by Michael R. Perry. I found it to be oddly interesting and bizarrely entertaining, but also extremely disturbing.Jerry (Reynolds) is a cheerful (and very positive) guy, who works at a bathtub factory. He lives alone, above a bowling alley, and often hallucinates that his cat and dog are talking to him; they also sometimes convince him to do things he really doesn't want to do. Jerry lost his mother (Valerie Koch), due to similar mental issues (at a very young age), and he's been assigned a psychiatrist, named Dr. Warren (Weaver), because of it. He also has a huge crush on an office coworker, named Fiona (Arterton). Things begin to go horribly wrong, one night, when Jerry asks Fiona out on a date, and she stands him up.The movie is pretty much all shown through Jerry's eyes. So even though horrific things keep happening, throughout the film, it mostly maintains a pretty positive and upbeat tone. This makes for a very strange, disturbing and darkly comedic film. I'm really torn about how I actually feel about it, because it kind of bothered me (in a lot of ways). Still it's very interesting, in very strange ways, and also pretty entertaining, in just as weird ways. The highlight of the movie, is Ryan Reynolds' performance; he's pretty much never been better. The rest of the cast is good as well, which makes me really wonder how the filmmakers were able to attract such a talented, and very likable, cast. It's definitely worth seeing, if you can handle this kind of really dark horror/comedy.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/QD4MXl8lkDU",The Voices

12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A unique black comedy that balances total silliness with proper darkness.,7,5 March 2018,"'The Voices (2015)' is a black comedy of the darkest proportions, walking on a razor-sharp tightrope where even the slightest breeze could mean the difference between total silliness and utter seriousness in a way which makes the opposite elements stick out like sore, misshapen and misjudged thumbs. Thankfully, the piece manages to pull its contrasting elements together remarkably well without pulling any punches or picking the wrong moments to place an ill-informed gag, aside from the finale dance number which comes out of left field and feels much sillier in tone than anything preceding it. It's an odd flick to get on board with, though, and surely won't be for everyone. 7/10",The Voices
13,bowmanblue,It's raining (murderous) cats and dogs,8,28 August 2015,"Ryan Reynolds – often thought of as one of those actors who gets by on his looks over his acting ability. Not true. He's actually pretty good (and I've been saying that since I saw him in 'The Nines.' Here, he plays 'Jerry' – a lovable factory worker who everyone gets on with. Unfortunately –for the afore-mentioned 'everybody' – he's also completely insane. His primary flaw (besides his traumatic childhood which you'll learn more about if you watch the film) is that he's lonely and, because of this, he's started lying to his psychiatrist about taking his medication. And, without his pills, he's started hearing voices.Throughout the film you'll see the world through Jerry's eyes where more than just the TV talks, namely his cat and dog – both of which give him dubious advice to put it mildly. And, without medication, it's not long before Jerry's actions start becoming more and more dark – to the point of murderous.It would be quiet easy to despise Jerry for his actions, but, as you'll see, he really is as much of a victim as those who die at his hands. It's not so much a case as you'll be rooting for a killer as you'll be hoping he finds some sort of happiness (or professional help that actually HELPS him!) in his depressed life.Plus it's funny. Okay, so grisly and horrific murder is never really a laughing matter, but the fact that all the violence is – technically – orchestrated by an evil talking cat and dog does go some way to lighten the mood. If there is a definition of a 'black comedy' then this is definitely it! You don't have to like horror or drama, just dark humour. That's the key to enjoying this film. It's as tragic as it's funny and there are many occasions where you won't know whether to laugh or cry. It'll never be mainstream as it's too dark for big screen success. I advise watching it and then enjoying the fact that you'll probably be the only person among your circle of friends who's seen it. Spread the word – it's good (gory) fun.",The Voices
14,dromasca,a horror movie packed in a box of chocolates,7,10 October 2020,"Marjane Satrapi bought her fame with the formidable ""Persepolis"", one of those books that promoted comics at the most serious artistic level, a largely autobiographical story describing the author's childhood during the Islamic revolution in Iran. After bringing this book to screen into an excellent animated film, Satrapi began a career as an actors feature films director, experimenting in different genres. 'The Voices' made in 2014 is the result of one of these experiments. It's a movie that may mislead if you look at the poster and even after watching about a quarter of it. It starts as a sweet romantic comedy in an American town. It continues in something completely different, gloomy and decadent, and those who are afraid of spoilers should better stop reading here. Fans of political correctness and those who are really scared by horror movies can also give up. The rest are invited to join the adventure.The story takes place in a very typical American town, where the main attractions are the bowling alley and the burgers and Chinese restaurants. Jerry (Ryan Reynolds), the hero of the film, works in a factory that packs something in big boxes, stacks them and ships them. Jerry looks good, he's a nice guy, the girls in the accounting and finance departments compete to be chosen by him for a date, and even his weirdness of talking loud with his dog and cat its (very cued pets, by the way) when coming home does not seem something to worry about, after all this happens all the time in the Disney studio movies. Maybe we should be a little worried about his regular visits to the psychologist, but she (excellently played by Jacki Weaver) seems more psychotic than her patient, a situation which often happens in reality. For me at least it was a surprise when the story went crazy. Really badly crazy.I liked the way Marjane Satrapi tells the story. It's a black comedy, a horror movie packaged as a romantic comedy with talking animals. When the romance and the voices of the animals turn out to be the visions of a serial killer, the viewer understands that everything until then was a very well executed convention. Fragments of reality are interspersed, but the vision remains that of the hero. If we are to look for a classic reference, then it would be Hitchcock's 'Psycho' if it had been filmed from the perspective of Norman Bates. Even when blood starts to flow, we are not allowed to completely enter the horror mood because it's then only that the romance between Jerry and Lisa begins, and Ryan Reynolds and Anna Kendrick are the perfect actors for a romantic comedy. The cinematography and the sets are excellently designed, and the bowling alley on the floor of which the hero's home is located has a chance to become a cult film setting. Don't make the mistake of leaving viewing when everything seems to be over, because the ending and the credits provide another commercial packaging for the horror story, that of a musical. Is the musical 'The Voices' in preparation for Broadway? I would not be that surprised.",The Voices

Jerry (Reynolds) is a likable, quiet and polite worker. He stays to himself and is pretty much limited to conversations with his pets. When he develops a crush on Fiona (Arterton) he is excited that she agrees to meet him for a date. When she doesn't show Jerry's true personality comes out. This is a difficult movie to recommend. I liked it and laughed some but it is very , very dark. Most comedies about murder and death are dark but Ryan Reynolds is such a likable guy that it really adds to the experience and tone of the movie.

16,westsideschl,A Different Approach,7,21 April 2015,"Perhaps a good part of the negative reviews stems from an expectation of either another cute talking animals movie for all ages or perhaps, or for the opposite category of viewer, a formula horror/slasher film. At first I was in that first group of viewers, impressed with the quality of the CGI of talking animals (as well as Ryan's versatility in voicing those critters) then transported to the second strand of viewers when the knifing began and I had to make a leap of consciousness/expectation to the dark side - a challenge mid-film. But, my understanding came in rewinding to Fiona's death scene in the forest in trying to figure out why she was bloodied on bare earth one day then a day later angelically dead with white flowers growing around her (the white flowered dress also added to the revelation). The film presents a psychologically disturbed individual's (Ryan as Jerry) view of what's happening (taking animals and heads), alternating with reality which included what he saw when he took his medication. The film tries to show, in it's clever way, the life of someone who can pass as ""normal"" yet be dangerously psychotic or schizophrenic. For more stars I would have finished in a tone consistent with rest of the film such as the alternate ending shown in special features. Also worth watching in special features is how the CGI was created and Ryan practicing his character voices.",The Voices
17,851222,Good dark comedy,8,12 April 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Voices"" (2014) is a darkly funny comedy thriller. This is a very well made film, because this genre is difficult to pull of successfully. Script is good, there are some funny moments, but most of them come from R rating and it's ""free of speech"". Acting was solid, pacing directing very good, at running time 1 h 40 min this movie doesn't drag and is involving from start till finish.Overall, ""The Voices"" is a good black R rated comedy.

18,sol-,Blame the Cat,7,3 October 2017,"Always smiling, upbeat and cheerful, a young factory worker casually hides the fact that he imagines his pets speaking to him; things take a macabre turn though as his spiteful cat leads him astray in this very dark black comedy from Marjane Satrapi, who also helmed the equally fascinating 'Persepolis'. Satrapi includes some great touches, such as contrasting shots of what the protagonist's world looks like when he is on and off medication and the subtle special effects used to make the cat and dog's mouths move makes his one-way conversations with them eerily realistic. The film's best asset though is the casting of Ryan Reynolds in the lead role. It's a performance that has been compared to Anthony Perkins in 'Psycho' with good reason; both are equally boyish, affable characters who we cannot help but sympathise with slightly no matter what they do. The film does, however, walk some very fine lines - not only in terms of good/bad taste, but also the way mental illness is sort of parodied - and it is easy to understand why the film has been less than well-received by some. For those not easily offended and interested in something weird, unusual and daringly different, this is an easy recommendation. It is also a motion picture best entered into with as few expectations as possible since a fair bit of its uncanny nature comes from unexpected directions.",The Voices
19,merklekranz,"Original idea for a ""dark comedy"" well executed ........",7,16 June 2016,"""The Voices"" certainly is not the first ""black comedy"" to have body parts stowed in a refrigerator. ""Ms. 45"" immediately comes to mind. In that film, Thana kills perverts, chops them up, and then disposes of the bodies piecemeal. In ""The Voices"", Ryan Reynolds keeps the heads in the refrigerator and talks to them. He also holds conversations with his pet dog and cat, who are constantly giving Reynolds advice about his serial killing. If you appreciate ""dark comedy"", then this is one not to miss. I'll even go so far as to suggest potential ""cult status"". It's original, funny, and well acted. There is no nudity and the gore is mostly off screen, but the film is entertaining in a morbid sort of way. Remember what the cat ""Mr. Whiskers"" said, when he suggested the killing continue. ""We could always get a bigger refrigerator."" - MERK",The Voices
20,Floated2,Unusual take on dark comedies,9,9 April 2016,"The voices is another lower independent film starring Reynolds. In the film, he truly captures the idea that Jerry is a man forced down a road of violence by things that he cannot control. He is a unique serial killer in that he so wants normalcy, companionship and happiness. The joy in Reynolds' eyes when he is shown human kindness by other co- workers (Gemma Arterton & Anna Kendrick) is as key to this performance as the insanity that other actors would have focused on and turned into scenery chewing. Reynolds uses his natural charm to great effect here. The voices has some similarities with American Psycho with Christian Bale, as both characters have some similar traits. Or an older film which has been somewhat forgotten is the Cable Guy starring Jim Carrey. Overall, the Voices is not a film for everyone and can be easily seen as unstable for those expecting different results. It is entertaining throughout and offers some twists.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 08/09/17' The Voices is a highly entertaining dark comedy. The film isn't meant to be taken as serious as some people are criticizing it, as we realize what is being shown is within the range of the character, which is why the film is titled ""The Voices"". By the end, everything makes more sense as there are some clues. As a further rewatch 11.26.20' enjoyed this film more so as one payed closer attention to detail and found more subtle clues and hints. Would enjoy Ryan Reynolds to do more dark comedy type films like this in the future. Still a hidden gem. Rating changed from 7 to 9.",The Voices
21,eddie_baggins,"Awkward and uneven, Reynolds saves the day",2,18 December 2015,"Some movies just have that ""wow"" factor, that little something that makes your jaw drop and your mind race. It's a rare thing for movies in this day and age to have that extra special something which makes the Voices an extraordinary feat as it has an abundance of ""wow"" moments with one little problem, there the wrong kind of wow moments!An incredibly inept mix of dark comedy and out right lunacy, that the Voices was even made is a wow enough moment, as its tonal shifts between a wannabe funny and violent journey into the mind of Ryan Reynolds annoyingly scattered Jerry and some strange kind of horror fable are totally misjudged.Once listed as one of the great un-made scripts floating around Hollywood in the famed Black List announcements, the Voices quite clearly at one stage led a life of much potential and promise but the finished product as directed by Persepolis filmmaker Marjane Satrapi is just not in any way shape or form a good film and is yet another poor decision by Ryan Reynolds that continues his ability to put his name to dire projects even though he gives it his all here.Reynolds Jerry is a downright nasty little man and someone we as an audience just can't in any way, shape or form warm to. His transformation from creepy yet in an off-putting way pleasant factory worker to crazed murderer who likes to keep the heads of his victims in his fridge is a bizarre and seedy trip made worse by his interactions with his creepy pets Bosco the dog and Mr. Whiskers the evil cat.The major selling point to the film is that these pets lead poor old Jerry down an increasingly murky path but all we get is a lot of foul mouthed rants and weird conversations that don't in anyway make the film a better experience and they feel in the end underutilised and uneven much like the fact that for some reason Gemma Arterton's Fiona and Anna Kendrick's Lisa would even bother to give deranged Jerry the time of day let alone spend time alone with him.Reynolds gives this film his all and at times he almost makes the films weirdness work (even voicing the animals of the tale) yet The Voices is a seriously misguided and dull affair that is all at once creepy, unlikeable and most tellingly neither funny or scary and is saved somewhat by one of the better end credits sequences in some time. An out and out misfire, it's hard to know why anyone here bothered especially Satrapi who on the back of Persepolis should know a thing or two about making a decent film.1 misused Tupperware container out of 5",The Voices
22,leonblackwood,Watchable but completely bonkers. 4/10,4,19 July 2015,"Review: What a crazy movie! The storyline is completely mad but funny, in a weird type of way and it's really unpredictable. Its about a psychopathic man called Jerry who works in a bathtub factory and takes a fancy to one of his work colleagues. After a whole, he plucks up the courage to ask the girl out but she's not really keen on him. When she finally agrees to go out with him on a date, he goes home and he talks to his cat and dog about how he should impress her. The cat is a vicious, mean animal who gets Jerry to do bad things but the dog has a kind heart and he tries to guide him down the correct path. His psychiatrist prescribes him pills so he doesn't hear the voices but the drugs make him quite depressed so he doesn't take them. When he goes to meet his date at a restaurant, he ends up sitting there all night waiting for her to turn up but she decides to go to a Karaoke bar with her friends instead. On the way home he bumps into her in the street and she asks for some help because her car has broken down. He then gives her a lift home and they end up in a car accident because a deer steps in the middle of the road. After taking the deer's life, because the deer told him to, the girl makes a run for her life and Jerry mistakingly takes her life after slipping in the woods. From there the movie goes completely crazy because he goes on a killing spree, with the help of his talking pets. His victims heads end up in his fridge and they also talk to him so he's getting different advice from everyone, which sends him mad. Its hard to say if I enjoyed this movie because the storyline is totally out there. Ryan Reynolds plays the psychopathic role quite well, along with the geeky innocent side to the character. It does go a bit too far after a while because his victims were getting murdered for silly reasons and the dance scene at the end really didn't make any sense. Maybe he found his happy place! Anyway, it's worth a watch just for its warped humour and his psychotic behaviour but you do have do be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. Watchable but strange!Round-Up: Ryan Reynolds has made way too many flops recently and this one really didn't help. Green Lantern was a terrible film and it really got slatted by the critics and R.I.P.D lost a lot of money at the box office because it was pretty awful. Safe House made a healthy profit, mainly because of Denzel Washington but Unlikely Hero and Chaos Theory were hardly heard of. He has made some small appearances in Ted and A Million Ways To Die In The West but he has failed in most of his major roles. At 38 years old and with a few major movies in the pipeline, like Self/less, Woman In Gold and Captive, I hope that his career makes a turn for the best. This movie was directed by Marjane Satprati from Iran who has only directed another three small films in her career called Persepolis, Chicken With Plums and the Gangs of the Jotas, which I have never heard of before. She managed to show a different side to Ryan Reynolds but the storyline was really strange and really not for everyone's taste. She did have a good cast with Ryan as the lead and Anna Kendrick and Gemma Arterton as his victims but I still found it hard to watch after a while.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $400,000 (Terrible!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/horrors about a troubled man who gets persuaded by his cat and dog to commit murders. 4/10",The Voices
23,digitalbeachbum,I knew the ending within the first five minutes,1,9 August 2020,"A 100% predictable movie within the first five minutes.I was watching the movie and when Jerry is getting dressed he is talking with Bosco. There is something that he says which sums everything up for the entire movie with one single sentence.I wish writers would pick up on this foreshadowing because it ruins the movie for some people. Removing that one line is a game changer from (1) star to possibly a (6) star movie.I like Ryan Reynolds, as an actor, but he plays the same person just with different intensities. You can actually see Van Wilder and Deadpool in this movie if you listen carefully.The ending was exactly how I thought it would end.",The Voices
24,jtindahouse,Too dark to really work,6,7 December 2015,"'The Voices' is a very dark movie indeed. Talking animals, Ryan Reynolds and Anna Kendrick would not lead you to believe things could be this bleak, but they certainly are. The end credits are done in quite a bizarre '40 Year Old Virgin' type way and I realised afterwards that this was necessary so the audience didn't leave the cinema completely depressed. Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a comedy (or at least supposed to be) at the heart of things but director Marjane Satrapi certainly pushed things to the dramatic extent she possibly could. Did this help the film? No, I think it was pushed too far to the point where it was no longer really fun to watch.Reynolds is very much the centrepiece of the film. He plays his character along with voicing all the animals and is in almost every single scene. His character is very sombre, overly polite and not a lot of fun (just think the polar opposite of 'Van Wilder'). His voice work with the animals was impressive, I had no idea until afterwards he had done them and had even thought to myself to look up who had done the voice of the cat because it was done so well. He does his best to carry this film to greater things but even he can't really pull it off. The comedy layer simply wasn't strong enough and the film suffers consequently. Simply hiring funny actors isn't enough, you have to give them something to work with as well.",The Voices
25,jadavix,Tonal irregularities,6,30 March 2018,"""The Voices"" is an odd horror-comedy type thing that isn't scary or funny or thrilling or much of anything. It's the fairly typical story about a boy-next-door who is also a mentally unstable killer. He has a crush on a beautiful office employee, played by Gemma Arterton, though another employee - Anna Kendrick - has a crush on him. His pets talk to him - a dog and a cat - and his psychiatrist, played by legendary Australian actress Jacki Weaver, has prescribed him antipsychotic medication that he refuses to take.You know that somebody's going to get killed, and then someone will find out who killed who and also get killed, and the body count will rise. The movie takes an ironic, light-hearted tone in regards to this activity; it's not a horror movie or even a thriller, really. It's also not funny at all, unless you think the sight of a talking dog and cat is amusing by default. The cat swears a fair bit, so some people might be amused by that, I guess.What is uncomfortable and unnecessary is that the movie adds a troubling backstory for the Ryan Reynolds character which doesn't fit at all with the silly tone of the movie. This is an explanation for his insanity that would fit in a gritty true-crime pic, not a deliberately ridiculous horror-comedy.The climax is also just not that interesting. It's quite predictable, like the rest of the movie, and I think they should have added something unexpected or interesting in there - aside from the awful song-and-dance number over the end credits.I'm not really sure what the makers of ""The Voices"" wanted to achieve with this movie. It gives the impression that they didn't know how to handle the light-hearted tone, or what the purpose of such a tone in a story like this is. The tone needs to clash with the content, but here they're both flat, they lie down and die, which is almost what the movie made me feel like doing.",The Voices
26,dfranzen70,Good thing your pets don't actually talk...,5,19 October 2017,"Ryan Reynolds plays a warehouse worker who has conversations with his cat and his dog. Weird enough on its own, but in this case Reynolds' Jerry is seeing a shrink, is off his meds, and is told to do pretty horrible things by his pets.Jerry a hard worker with a fine reputation, falls for a coworker named Fiona (Emma Arterton). When she stands him up for a date – sort of a miscommunication – tragedy ensues. And then when other coworkers (like Anna Kendrick) enter the mix, more tragedy ensues.The movie's tone shifts an awful lot. Sometimes it's slapstick comedy – look, talking animals using profanity! – but other times it's a pretty serious, deadpan horror movie. I mean, there's a plethora of blood and guts. Think of this as a predecessor of sorts to TV's Dexter. Bodies are chopped up. Jerry's madness is at turns amusing and horrifying.Fun fact: Reynolds himself does the voices of his cat (Mr. Whiskers) and his dog (Bosco) – and they don't sound much like Reynolds' normal voice. Mr. Whiskers appears to be Scottish, and Bosco has a Southern drawl. But as they're both aspects of Jerry's damaged psyche, so there's a little bit of him in there.Jerry's descent into utter madness (juxtaposed with his endless smile and optimism) is fun to watch, and Reynolds does a fine job. He gets some able support from Arterton and Kendrick, too. But it all adds up to a movie that doesn't strike a consistent tone, thus just missing its mark.",The Voices
27,GiraffeDoor,One of the few truly original and unique movies.,8,8 April 2020,"You know, it's kind of crazy how little marketing this got. I would have had no awareness of this movie at all if I hadn't delibarately watched a compilation of trailors to upcoming movies, and then I saw or heard nothing about before stumbling across on a streaming service.And it's directed by Majane ""Persepolis"" Satrapi too, I mean...this movie is strange before we even begin...A terrifying movie.It feels like a comedy in the way it's scripted and visualized albeit a dark one and this is how I chose to access it at first. It really had no other choice since the (very convincing) talking animals plus a serious tone would just be risible.Ryan Reynold's interprets a very rich protagonist that holds a lot of the movie. He manages to be sympathetic in the depiction of mental illness. He's a little bit old school coocoo bananas in the performance at times but I am content to say this is as sensitive depiction of psychological as we could hope for.Handled with a sense of humor, seeing into this victim's mental prison is vivid and poignant and really helps one to understand why some people do not want to take their medication as their mind problems are not only a path to destruction but also a way they cope with a cold, bleak world conveyed with with magnificent visual flare.The ending will polarize. I personally think it was perfect.",The Voices
28,estebangonzalez10,Ryan Reynolds like you've never seen him before,7,15 March 2015,"""Do you ever hear voices?""The Voices is a bizarre dark comedy starring Ryan Reynolds in one of his best performances to date. It is directed by Marjane Satrapi who's better known for her Iranian Oscar nominated animated film Persepolis. The Voices takes a common element from animated films and applies it in a dark way here in this live action movie. We can all recall the classic angel and devil scenes in the Tom and Jerry cartoons where the voices tell the character what to do. Satrapi takes that familiar premise and applies it extremely well here as Reynolds's character speaks to his pets. His dog, Bosco representing the angel, while his cat, Mr. Whiskers represents the devil. They are both voiced distinctly by Reynolds in a humorous way. Despite having some serious psychological issues, Reynolds' character is likable and we get to see things through his perspective. Satrapi does a great job of making sure we identify with his isolated character before presenting the world as it actually is instead of through his eyes. The Voices has some tonal shifts and does become a bit less interesting towards the final act, but the buildup is rather engaging and funny. Having Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick, and Jacki Weaver in the supporting cast is always a huge addition and they all deliver solid performances. The Voices is one of those films that has its flaws, but despite it all feels unique and inventive as you never quite know what direction the film is going to go to next. It's a quirky film that benefits from a strong and memorable performance from Reynolds who manages to make his character likable despite the horrible things he does. Ryan Reynolds is Jerry, a quirky but charming guy who falls for one of the employees at the bathtub factory he works at. He seems likable, but it is easy to see that there is something off about him. His crush is played by Gemma Arterton who doesn't seem too interested in him. She works in the accounting department along with Lisa (Anna Kendrick) and Alison (Ella Smith), whom she likes to spend time with after work. One night they invite Jerry along and Lisa seems to have a liking for him, but he insists on courting Fiona (Gemma Arterton). One night she stands him up for a date and things take an interesting turn. Jerry isn't a very social person, but we get to see him interact with his pets at home. Jacki Weaver plays his psychiatrist, Dr. Warren, who tries to help him in his attempts of courting Fiona but reminds him he mustn't stop taking his pills. The Voices is offbeat and some tonal shifts may take you out of the movie, but it works thanks to Reynolds performance. His schizophrenic behavior is a good explanation as to why the film seems to change gears from dark comedic moments to horror. His voice work is impressive and it lightens up the mood in an otherwise dark film. Satrapi has managed to direct a unique film which is hard to categorize because it switches gears on us. The greatest thing about The Voices is how well Satrapi manages to portray the world through Reynolds' eyes during one moment and then present things how they really are in the next. Despite losing some of its appeal during the final act, I still enjoyed this and found Reynolds performance to be worth recommending. It's messy, but at the same time remains stylish and inventive.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Voices

This is one of those flicks (for me) that popped up out of nowhere and I had never heard of it nor knew what to expect in the story. First this is not a laugh out loud comedy but instead it's an OMG smile on your face type story because it just gets more and more bizarre as the film progresses.If you choose to watch this movie (and please do) keep an eye on Jerry's apartment above the abandoned bowling alley. Director: Marjane Satrapi & Writer: Michael R. Perry really knew how to get your full attention.

Brilliant!!",10,22 April 2021,"Its another film that people just didnt get, actually some did but it should have been a hit. I actually would have loved to see a sequel it easily could be accomplished. Anyway Ryan Reynolds is an example of what people call a God given talent, I'm agnostic but let's just use that description. He has a comedic edge even when dramatic and it's a rare find. The only actor I can compare him to is Cary grant. The looks, charm, spontaneous humor and wit. And above all charisma!! It shines here as he makes you like and get to know his character who is suffering from a mental disorder or multiple disorders yet seems normal at times. The dark humor just adds to the beauty of this film. But make no mistake it's all Ryan Reynolds!! BRILLIANT!!!",The Voices

Ryan Reynolds plays our anti-hero who is a warehouse schlub working in the packing department but not really connecting to anyone. Once going cold turkey from his medication, he tries hard connecting with any girl that'll have him but the end results are usually disastrous. Shot w/a candy colored vision of dreams run amok, this film could've gone anywhere instead of the obvious murderous rampage we end up in.

35,AudioFileZ,A Comedy Whose Darkness Too Often Exceeded It's Humor,4,16 February 2015,"While there's sure to be those who find a kind of brilliant mixture of ""uber-dark"" comedy here it's simply hard to say more will than won't. Perhaps it's the fact that serial killing at the hand of a schizophrenic psychopath whose cat tells him to murder isn't, under any circumstance, funny.The primary vehicle is the meant to be absurd voices from the ""good and bad"" inner-self as depicted as coming from Jerry's (Ryan Reynolds) cat, Mr. Whiskers, and dog, Bosco. This is how Jerry's mental illness is personified. And, yes, it could be funnybut, it falls flat against the murdering which ensues. The movie builds Jerry into a person we want to believe doesn't want to kill because he's shown as likable and wanting to be a person with meaningful relationships who contributes to society. But, even with a sad sack back-story his character can't achieve any kind of sympathy to soften up the viewer to actually relax and laugh.In the final analysis the comedy doesn't pull it's intended hat-trick of making the truly disturbing behavior funnyas if it was forcing a kind of hard sale that a ""bright"" off-center crazed caricature of a killer was both arty and comedic. No sale here. Ryan Reynolds needs a reboot alright as even with his solid performance (the writing is the problem) this is just a bad movie that reaches for Avant-Gardie dark comedy originality only to be disturbingly offensive. If there's something funny about a schizophrenic serial killer (the intended outcome?) The Voices never got there.",The Voices
36,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Look at Mental Illness and Medication with a Dark Twist,8,11 February 2020,"This was a film that I remember when it was coming out, but then it kind of just disappeared. When I got into listening to horror movie podcasts, this one would pop up periodically and I added it to my list of films to check out. I finally did when for my podcast, I decided for the month of February to do two episodes that featured a woman director. The synopsis is a likable guy pursues his office crush with the help of his evil talking pets, but things turn sinister when she stands him up for a date.Now this synopsis was a bit misleading. We are in the town of Milton, which is quite odd if I'm going to be honest as our introduction to it is somewhat surreal. There is music accompanying it, the town isn't very big and it is based around this factory that does bathroom fixtures. Working there is Jerry (Ryan Reynolds). He's called over by his boss, Dennis Kowalski (Paul Chadhidi), and invited to help plan their company barbeque. Through their conversation, we learn that Jerry has a court appointed psychologist.Jerry goes home to his pets, Mr. Whiskers the cat and Bosco the dog. The problem is that they're talking to him. Mr. Whiskers has a Scottish accent and both are actually done by Reynolds. He tells them about being picked for helping plan this where Bosco is happy, much like any dog would be, and Mr. Whiskers thinks it is stupid.Also on this committee is Fiona (Gemma Arterton) who Jerry has a crush on, along with John (Adi Shankar), Dave (Sam Spruell) and Sheryl (Alessa Kordeck). Fiona comes back to the meeting while Jerry is cleaning up to ask a question about the equipment and Jerry thinks he hears her say that she can come up to her department any time. The picnic is fun and Jerry comes up later to ask Fiona out. Lisa (Anna Kendrick) has a crush on him and asks him to join them for a drink. She wants him to take her home after, but instead he ends up driving Fiona home. He asks her out again on this drive and she reluctantly agrees. She ends up blowing him off though.Her car won't start and it is raining out. By happenstance, Jerry is passing by when Fiona needs help. She tries to make it up, but they end up hitting a deer and he kills it to put it out of his misery. This scares Fiona who flees into the woods. He runs after her and accidentally kills her. When he goes home, Mr. Whiskers tells him what he has to do so he doesn't get into trouble. His therapist Dr. Warren (Jacki Weaver) tries to help and get him to take his medication, but he has to face reality if he does that and his reality is much worse than he realizes.If you've listened to me before, you'd know that when it comes to horror/comedies I can be quite leery of them. This one actually really works for me. I like how we build the mystery and story of what is going on here. We get subtly introduced that Jerry has mental issues. He isn't very stable and despite how normal he looks, he has issues fitting in. I think that Reynolds ability at comedy plays on that pretty well here.To delve more into this character, we learn through flashbacks and things that he says, his mother was from Germany and she was given an ultimatum by his father to stay there or come with him. This caused her to breakdown mentally to where she self-harmed himself and forced a young Jerry to do something traumatic. Now that he's out of the hospital and trying to live a normal life, there's an interesting commentary on medication and something that seems quite real why some people don't take it. He doesn't feel like himself, he never really had any friends so by taking his medication he would lose the voices he's projecting that are his animals. It is kind of heartbreaking to be honest.I also feel bad for him in that being that he's socially awkward, he doesn't realize that Fiona isn't really interested in him or that Lisa is really interested in him. It does take some time to come to terms with the latter, in that Lisa is better for him and it really builds to what happens in the end even more to make it such a stronger fall from grace and much more impactful. There's also an interesting commentary about religion here, being that this is in the town of Milton, Jerry calls Fiona an angel at one point and we see her that. Plus he's asking about the angels from the bible who all have names and there's a hint to the end of the joke through the name of the town and their most famous work.It seems like next I should shift over to talking about the acting. If you couldn't tell, I think that the acting for this is pretty strong. I thought Reynolds does a great job at being this awkward guy who is good looking, but is so messed up from his past. This makes an intriguing look at nature vs. nurture. There's a history of mental illness here so he definitely has the genetics not being in his favor. Going even farther though, there's a traumatic event that happens to him that sends him over the edge. I'm so glad the choice was made to have him doing all of the voices, as he realizes they're all from his head so it should be a variation of his voice. The Scottish one though had me losing it as I'm a big fan of Mr. Whiskers. I thought that Arterton was solid as the English lady he's in love with, but she's low key mean to him. He doesn't realize though which makes it worse. I found Kendrick to be adorable and she is such a good character here. It really helps to build the impact of it as well. I also thought that Weaver, Ella Smith, Chadhidi and the rest did well for what was needed.That will take me to the pacing, which I thought was fine. You don't see a lot of horror comedies that run as long as this one does. This comes in at 103 minutes, but it really didn't feel like it. There was a point where something happened that I wasn't sure how they were going to continue and I actually liked where it went. I do think it could have been trimmed a bit. I'm not taking any points off though as I never was bored and I liked where it ended up. The ending credit sequence was quite odd and actually made me happy in an odd way if you really think about it.Moving to the effects of this movie, I thought they were well done. The blood looked real as well as the bit of gore that we get. There are actually a lot of subtle things that are done though as well. The way that Jerry sees his life is different when he's on and off his medications. I like getting these glimpses as it makes this so much better overall for me. There is a bit of CGI when it comes to making the animals talk. I don't hate it as it worked and since this from the mind of a sick man, I'm more forgiving. I would say that the cinematography was solid as well.Now with that said, I ended up really digging this movie. For being a horror comedy, it really explores things much deeper than I was expecting. The depth of Jerry was quite interesting to me while looking at his mental illness. Him wanting to fit in and just find his place is sad with how things that turn out. The acting really brought this to life. It does run a bit long, but I was there for the ride for sure. The effects were really good across the board, going more practical than CGI, but I didn't have an issue with either. I thought this was shot well overall and the soundtrack wasn't my favorite. It fit the tone for the movie though. My rating here would be that this was a good movie for sure and would recommend giving this a viewing.",The Voices
37,robertemerald,Quirky things-go-horribly-wrong movie,7,31 October 2019,"2014 was also the year that Miss Meadows appeared. Both that movie and The Voices are similar in their approaches, as each begins with a premise of innocence which is gradually eroded. Both rely on the performance and charm of the lead. Ryan Reynolds does a good job as the helpful childlike employee, reminding me a little of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, though with less exuberance and ultimately far less gravity. The Voices is an easy movie to watch, the story is relatively uncomplicated, and early on the lead is very likeable and you want him to do alright. When it comes undone you hope he'll find a way out. I think it says a lot about how the mentally ill are far less responsible for crimes than the rest of us.Just a side note about Miss Meadows: Initially I struggled to remember the name of that movie. Had I not recalled that there was a ""Miss"" in the title I would never have found it, despite describing both the plot and the dvd cover in detail at several search sites. If ever you find you really like a 'lesser' movie (ie, not a blockbuster), then my suggestion is that you make a quick note of it, because if you forget the title you may well be in for a very frustrating time indeed.",The Voices
38,Seraphion,Nice balance between comedy and horror,6,7 February 2015,"Jerry works at the packing and shipping division at a company. One day he meets the girl from accounting, Fiona, who he immediately likes. He goes home and shares his thoughtswith his pets, Bosco the dog and Mr. Whiskers the cat. Apparently Jerry has a mental condition. Fiona asks Jerry to come by at the accounting office where he meets Lisa and Allison. One day Jerry asks Fiona on a date at a restaurant. Fiona softly avoids his request by messaging his phone. She instead goes for karaoke with Lisa and Allison. But on her way home Fiona finds her car is broken and accidentally runs into Jerry. He takes her home, but on the road a deer randomly crosses the road and crashes into Jerry's car. His condition kicks in, making Jerry kill the deer. Fiona runs in fear and Jerry catches her and accidentally kills her. At his pets' suggestion, Jerry returns the next day and chops down Fiona's body to little pieces. He stores Fiona's head in the fridge. Soon Fiona's head also speaks to him, demanding Jerry to kill again to give her a friend in the fridge. Jerry gets close to Lisa until they spend a night at Lisa's place. As a surprise visit, Lisa comes to Jerry's place but then she finds out the remains of Jerry's late night activity with Fiona's body. So Jerry kills her too. Allison gets the rumors about Jerry's horrific childhood past. When she goes to his place, Jerry also kills her. Allison's colleagues get more suspicious about Jerry and they also go to Jerry's place. They call the police on him. Jerry has kidnapped his own psychiatrist. When the police storms into his house and accidentally sets the place on fire, Jerry manages to sneak into the basement and evaded capture. But then he makes his choice to not to obey the voices inside his head, in the form of the voices of his pets especially Mr. Whiskers, to escape and kill again.The story nicely balances the weight between the comedy and the horror elements. It starts out modest enough as another small town factory worker tale but then it kind of slams the main issue just as the main character goes home and speaks with his pets. Though it doesn't have any significant twist or turn, making the story quite predictable, but it kind of finishes the movie well enough by having the lead character to take the right choice.The source of the humor is mainly focused on the voices inside Jerry's head. The thing with Mr. Whiskers who speaks as the Scottish gangster type versus Bosco who speaks as the retarded but pure and honest Southerner makes the dialog between Jerry and them very funny. Mr. Whiskers' swearing and Bosco's act of swallowing all the verbal abuses is quite literally the only thing that makes this movie humorous.The horror side feels like the other side of the coin in this movie. It feels lingering even when the movie is being comedic. This is especially true after Jerry suddenly pulls out a knife at the deer's request. When Jerry keeps Fiona's head and starts chatting with it, things change into the more laid back horror mood where things would go comedic at the same time as Jerry gets his hands dirty. Having Jerry flashes back to his childhood when his mental problems began doesn't seem to be necessary in my opinion.The acting overall is actually good. Ryan Reynolds is indeed commendable for his three parts in this movie; as Jerry himself, and as the voice actors for Jerry's pets Mr. Whiskers and Bosco. He did very well in depicting the three different characters and coming up with the different voices that at first I didn't notice that it was him at those animal voices. Gemma Arterton played just enough to add the hottie catch angle to the story. On the other hand, with more than three movie released in 2014 Anna Kendrick seems to be very busy. Yet while performance is not special, she managed to keep them quite consistent in quality over those movies.My opinion for The Voices (2014) is that it deserves a 6 out of 10 score. A recommendation is just a so-so from me. It is a nice play of balance between comedy and horror, and can be quite an entertainment, but I don't think it will worthy the money for cinema tickets.",The Voices

Although i am not very fond of Ryan Reynolds, he was kind of descent in this movie but nothing spectacular about it. Script is based by crazy guy on a probation trying to make thins right in his life, but can't escape his delusional skin and go even crazier and scarier than ever. It is not a very new concept if you have in mind that movies of psychological horrors were very popular in the 80's, such as Maniac or Fear City or Psycho and etc. Although movie is not bad, i mean when i started to watch and story started to unravels it was like comedy in beginning but after some scenes it became pretty scary and even gruesome at some sights.In my opinion the whole show was stolen by Anna Kendrick, she was just amazing in her role of a supportive co-worker and lover, that i almost fell in love with her instantly. She was acting like she is very spontaneous and not even acting, it was magnificent performance to me. She deserves much better credit in this movie, but i must say all crew here is pretty descent starting with Ryan, Gemma and Jacki etc. In conclusion, this movie is nothing spectacular and already seen from various years till now, plot is just similar to 80's flicks.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",The Voices
40,Sergeant_Tibbs,I'll take my comedy black.,7,26 August 2015,"I can just see the look on people's faces who read this script. It's a do or die type concept, but it doesn't surprise me that The Voices found itself on the Black List's most liked unmade screenplays list for a couple years before going into production. Building its own heightened world and dark but sweet language, it's lucky to be paired with such vision from director Marjane Satrapi and the production design. However, it's a film that just goes too far and that's where it loses me, especially to the point where it writes itself into a corner and the only solution is a bizarre satiric musical number. At times it feels like it's going dark for the sake of it rather than to serve its simple theme of isolation and insanity. But there's still a lot of delight before The Voices goes in over its head. Ryan Reynolds has a good opportunity to stretch his legs after an impressive turnout in Buried, also disappearing into the role of voicing the pets.

First up: 'The voices'.Ryan Reynolds is technically a very good actor, but somehow I'm not always convinced; there's something slick about him that I find hard to shake. And when he plays a complex part in a film that has to balance between thriller, horror, comedy and drama, it doesn't make things easier. Gemma Arterton and Anna Kendrick respectively play the carefree bombshell and the sweet wallflower, and do so convincingly.The story is a refreshing take on the lone serial killer theme, with hilarious (underplayed and original) use of a talking dog and cat. It has a serious side to it, also, and there's a little gore and suspense, too. But the question always is, when there's so much going on, does it all come together as a whole? And I must say it hardly did, though it's an admirable effort, still.A good 6 out of 10.",The Voices

46,Pumpkin_Man,A Weird Quirky Horror Comedy That Grows on You!!!,8,5 September 2015,"The more I thought about it, the more I realized I really liked this movie. It's a dark comedy with horror elements. Ryan Reynolds' character is very similar to Norman Bates from 'Psycho' He's obviously very unstable, but there's something charming about him and you begin to sympathize with him. For a movie about a psycho hearing his cat, dog, and decapitated heads talking to him, it was made very well. Jerry is a lonely man who lives with his two pets; Mr. Whiskers the cat, and Bosco the dog. He sees a psychiatrist and works at a bathtub factory. He begins falling in love with a British woman named Fiona. After an awkward date, Jerry accidentally hits a deer and imagines that the deer talks and asks him to end his life. Fiona tries to run, but Jerry goes after her and accidentally stabs her with a knife. He cuts her up, and places her head in his refrigerator. He begins seeing her head talking to him, along with the cat and the dog. Things only get worse for him, as Fiona's dead head asks him to kill again so she can have someone to talk to. If you like weird quirky dark humored comedies, you'll enjoy THE VOICES!!!",The Voices
47,areatw,"Absolutely bonkers, just how I like my comedies",7,29 December 2019,"'The Voices' is a light-hearted black comedy designed to appeal to people who enjoy ridiculous, nonsensical, barking mad (excuse the pun) films that are so stupid they're funny. I'm absolutely one of those people and I thought this film was great - definitely one of the best black comedies I've watched in a long time.Unless I'm mistaken, this is the first Ryan Reynolds comedy I've seen other than the Deadpool films, which I didn't like at all. Any doubts I had though quickly went away as he was very funny in this film and worked well with the jokes and content.I don't know what it is about absurd, 'out there' comedies that appeals to me, but 'The Voices' was right up my street. Maybe I'm just immature. Whatever it is, I enjoyed this film.",The Voices
48,brchthethird,Ryan Reynolds is a Norman Bates for the 21st century,8,5 March 2015,"For some reason Ryan Reynolds hasn't really taken off as a movie star, but I can't really see why. He has the good looks and he has a likable personality. Maybe it has to do with GREEN LANTERN? (not the best movie, but I still enjoyed it). Well, this time teamed up with director Marjane Satrapi (PERSEPOLIS) in her English-language debut, Ryan Reynolds delivers what is probably the best performance of his career. He plays Jerry, a rather unassuming (but subtly creepy) guy who works at a faucet and fixture warehouse in a small town. Everything seems alright on the surface, but deep inside Jerry has some problems. Aside from a troubled childhood, he also hears voices inside his head, and these voices tell him to do things...bad things. I'll just say that for those looking for a lighthearted comedy, this isn't it. THE VOICES goes to some pretty dark places, but manages to balance the tone fairly evenly between comedy and shock, of which there is plenty. But most importantly, Jerry is a guy you actually care about. Despite his...issues, he really wants to do the right thing and live a normal life. Too bad that his cat Mr. Whiskers is more influential than his goodhearted dog Bosco. Across the board, all of the performances were excellent. You have Anna Kendrick and Gemma Arterton who play a couple of Jerry's coworkers, and Jacki Weaver plays his court-appointed psychiatrist. They could have been developed a little more, but this is mostly Ryan Reynold's show and boy does he deliver! From a technical standpoint, I thought the cinematography and production design lent a sort of fairy-tale quality to the film, and the color scheme which had a lot of pinks and oranges provided a nice contrast with dark subject material. As far as the gory stuff is concerned, they don't show a whole lot, instead opting for some pretty gruesome sound design. Often the power of suggestion is more effective than actually showing violent acts. And, in this case, it actually works in the film's favor because Jerry can remain just as likable when you don't actually see him kill people most of the time. If there's any weaknesses to the film, it's that it doesn't really try anything new or revolutionary in its approach to the whole ""loveable serial killer"" thing. Almost nothing that happens in this movie is unpredictable in some way, with one big exception which I'll leave for you to experience on your own should you choose to watch this. Overall I enjoyed this a lot, mainly because I'm drawn to oddball films like this, but also because I haven't seen Ryan Reynolds this good in, well, forever. For lovers of dark comedies, I'd say THE VOICES is a must-see.",The Voices

51,gregsrants,Great Dark Comedy,7,9 March 2015,"Jerry is your typical next door neighbor type. That is, if you next door neighbor hears voices through his two pets which lead him to homicidal tendencies. Like I said – your typical next door neighbor type.Played with simplistic precision by actor Ryan Reynolds, Jerry is not without issues stemming from his youth. Via flashbacks we learn of an encounter with his mother that has seemingly scarred Jerry into his adult life. Still, with the help of prescription drugs via his psychiatrist (played by Academy Award nominee Jackie Weaver), Jerry is able to adapt as best he can into society and has recently acquired work at a local factory where he falls for co-workers Fiona (Gemma Arterton) and soon later, Lisa (Anna Kendrick).Unfortunately, the two women thrust into Jerry's lives have no inclination that Jerry has psychotic snaps and routinely talks to his two pets – a cat named Mr. Whiskers and a dog named Bosco. Any pet owner will confess that talking to their pets is not uncommon, but Jerry's pets talk back and give him advice particularly on how to act with his new friends. It is Mr. Whiskers that is the homicidal voice of the two. The foul mouthed feline encourages Jerry to act violently after an accident leaves Fiona dead in a remote area of forest and upon advice from his four pawed pet, Jerry dismembers the body leaving the head in his refrigerator. The severed head also talks to Jerry and it's longing for companionship amongst the milk and dairy products of the top shelf prompt Jerry to further his homicidal instincts which lead to some dark comic moments that are saturated with a solemn sadness.Reynolds relishes the role (side note: how can Reynolds continue to look like he is fresh out of high school?) with the entire premise landing on his shoulders. Play it too much like Van Wilder and the film falls into groan-worthy territory. Play it too serious and the film would be an uneven mix of Patrick Bateman meeting Milo & Otis. But Reynolds hits his target and the direction of Marjane Satrapi allows the film to enter zones of discomfort but brings things back to the heart of Jerry which is conflicted and terribly confused.There are not enough dark comedies surrounding head chopping serial killers so The Voices was a treat outside of the mediocrity that crams our viewing schedule.

The only thing I knew about the film is that it contained talking animals. If you hear a film contains talking animals you tend to think you are about to watch a cute family film. The Voices is definitely not a cute family film! I notice the overview of the film says that Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) is a likable guy. Right from the start of the film I think it's fair to say that he's a bit odd. Jerry has a crush on Fiona (Gemma Arterton) from Accounts, but is also battling mental health issues.The film can definitely be placed comfortably in the black comedy genre. Whilst it isn't fantastic it is never boring and does have a couple of genuinely funny scenes. Anna Kendrick is also really good as Lisa.

The premise works best as a dark comedy but the movie gets really depressing as it goes a lot into the character's actual suffering with schizophrenia. It becomes at different times a drama, a grisly horror film, and a cartoony surreal fantasy. I don't know. This is a really hard sell. I guess I can appreciate it's honesty in actually acknowledging schizophrenia and mental health problems but then they've sort of shot themselves in the foot as it cannot work then as a dark comedy. I don't want to laugh at schizophrenic hallucinations being portrayed as a cartoon in one scene and then seeing Reynolds with his therapist in agony in another. I think what the film should have done is start off with the comedic effect and then have it wear off as it goes into the seriousness of the situation. It doesn't. The film ends with a big dance number where Reynolds dances with Jesus and his victims.",The Voices
56,rubenm,"Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est?",7,17 March 2015,"I had a rather hard time assessing this movie. I hesitated because on the one hand it's so bizarre that it's almost getting ridiculous, and on the other hand it's so audacious and bold that it's really one of a kind. I am inclined towards the latter. Sure, there are scenes that are a bit ridiculous. Hearing the main character starting a conversation with his cat is a bit unorthodox, to say the least. But that's nothing compared to the conversations with severed heads and wounded deer, later on in the film. Also, from the start it's not immediately clear what kind of film this is. There are surreal parts, some things are satirical, there are bloody scenes verging on horror, and there is the psychological aspect. This psychological theme is the most important and the most original characteristic of the film. The speaking animals symbolize the different dimensions in the personality of a schizophrenic serial killer. What I liked very much, is that director Marjane Satrapi wants us to understand his mind. Jerry, the lead character, doesn't really want to kill the girls he dates, he only wants to lead a normal life and be liked by them. But he isn't able to control some parts in his mind, urging him to indulge in killing. Satrapi could have told this in a 'normal' way. But the choice to include speaking animals in the film, and severed heads that go on living, and lots of other weird things, give the film a strange, unique feel. It's a film that's ashamed of nothing, that doesn't shy away from anything. Every idea that came up in Satrapi's mind is made into a scene, it seems. The result is a film that's not perfect. But what it lacks in perfection, is compensated with an abundance of wild ideas and stylistic versatility.",The Voices

So, naturally, I was excited to see ""The Voices."" Sometimes dark comedies have problems with shifting tones as the film will go from dark comedy to drama or horror. Often, these shifts are chaotic and very jarring but ""The Voices"" blended these shift in tones so perfectly that it felt like a natural evolution and was almost unnoticeable. The story goes from being silly and quirky at the beginning to being something far more dramatic and far darker at the end but it never felt like the film was suddenly jumping genres. Thanks to terrific writing and excellent directing, the film flowed exceptionally well and made for a very entertaining experience for me.

Ryan Reynolds hears voices in his head which he projects through his Cat and Dog. It's a pretty sick story, made sicker by how colorful the whole film is.

It all seems real to him, but we as the viewer and the other in the films catches a glimpse sometimes of the reality, he actually knows it is not all right, but he feels better in his fantasy world. The film makers have tried to make a comedy out of this, but it doesn't actually work as a comedy, I think it works as a serious film about a person with problems and yes it is better with a bit of humor, but they actually ruined it at the end for me. They could have kept is as a serious film with bad things happening because of the illness (and the stupid talking cat and dog), they could have kept it in the dark comedy and never tried to make it fun, but more weird, actually the ending ruins it. The last dancing part was too much, I hate happy endings, just for the sake of keeping it fun, let the dog and cat say goodbye and then have the credits roll over the white background, boom much better ending.I found it very good, dark and weird fun all up until the end, my character is given based on the ending not being the way they have it, but ending the way I wrote it :)",The Voices
61,MattBrady099,Crazy but understandable Reynolds,7,20 February 2015,"Who every thought that a movie starring Ryan Reynolds where he talks to his pets like Doctor Dolittle that tell him to kill people would actually make a pretty damn enjoyable film.The story is about are main character Jerry who is a likable bachelor living in a seemingly normal apartment along with his dog, Bosco, and his cat, Mr. Whiskers. But under his innocent facade lies the minds of killer - thanks to the advice he gets from his evil cat, even while his benevolent dog tries to steer him right.I don't think I'm the only one who thought this movie was going to bad and extremely laughable, I mean look at the plot for this movie and you may think to yourself ""Wow this is going so awful but at least I'm going to laugh of how bad the movie is"". That was my prediction before seeing the film and after seeing it I was surprise of how much of the film I took seriously and didn't really laugh much. The movie would be a lot funny if Nicolas Cage was cast for this role it will be the best comedy in years because we all know the kind of acting style Cage users in his movies which makes them comedy gold.Ryan Reynolds is the kind of person that I feel sorry for, I mean give the guy a break his past movies got poor ratings and most of his films flopped hard at the box office. He seems like a really nice guy in real life judging by his interviews, and that's why he fitted the role so perfectly has this nice, lonely and also insane killer. What Reynolds got so well about his character is how he can switch personality, one minute his nice and the next his insane. Good work Ryan.The director of this movie Marjane Satrapi who previously did a film called Persepolis which I think not a lot of people saw, which is a shame really because it's a great movie. Satrapi directed this movie with style and a sense of passion from other films or TV shows to make this movie and the main character, because through out the movie I got that mix of Doctor Dolittle and that Elijah Wood film Maniac. She directed the movie and she actually made the whole film for me serious. Nice one Marjane Satrapi. The movie itself is beyond weird and strange, but it's the kind of strange that I look at and accept the strangeness because well I think the world and people are strange, because we are just ants living on a floating rock in the big galaxy, think about that.For problems these only some like: With out giving anything away, the ending to this movie has to be the biggest What The F*** moment that I had.

A movie that shows us the point of view of a serial killer. I would say it's a film I've always wanted to see but I believe I have. I've just never seen it pulled off so well.'The Voices' centers around Ryan Reynolds character, Jerry. A schizophrenic hollow of a man trying to force his way back to a ""normal"" life. Reynolds pulls off the best performance of his career and quite possibly the best of the year. (as of right now) As incredibly dynamic as Reynolds Performance is the supporting cast is where this film falters most. The usually impressive cast Often comes across bored or lazy. It's very subtle things that cause this. Such as, a heavily drawn in breath, followed by a glance in an odd direction. As to say, I'm sick of this. Let me go home. Kinda like when someone makes an outrageous request at the end of a shift. Besides the sometimes iffy supporting cast performances, the characters they portray are also poorly developed. If rounded at all. I suppose this works out since they almost all end up tasting the bitter brine of death. All of which are done off by the highly likable Jerry. Jerry is what makes 'The Voices' click. He is the most accessible psychopath ever put to the big screen. The writing on this character (and this character alone) is immaculate. It so effortlessly creates a villain that never actually is the villain. He's lovable, awkward, and above all, highly disturbed. This is mainly due to a horrid childhood. Which is mentioned a spare few times in the film. Yet, in the short time is uses 'The Voices' drives home quite possibly the worst childhood a middle class kid could have.The film is incredibly unique with Its lighthearted tone, intensely unsettling lead and wickedly dark humor.

I can't see how this rates as dark comedy, aside from a few Disney like effects to show the dream word Reynolds inhabits.Even though the setting is America, the film was made in Germany and the rather bizarre feel to it seems geared more to Germanic tastes than Americans. Also, the date may say 2014 but Reynolds seems quite young here looking as he did in Van Wilder making me wonder how long this film has been sitting on a shelf waiting for a distributor.In the end you ask yourself how did a big name cast such as this wind up in Germany making in essence a cheap rather plot less slasher film?",The Voices

71,solojere,The Credits are the Best Part,5,23 April 2020,"This movie is a really mixed bag. Some things work really well, and others just don't make any sense at all. So, I will break down my thoughtsPros:
The credits are amazing and diffidently worth re-watching.
The first death came out of nowhere.
Anna Kendrick did great with what she was given.
The revelation about Jerry's childhood is heartbreaking.
Ryan Reynolds did pretty good with what he was given.
The talking heads were funny at first.Cons:
The acting from all the minor characters was terrible. Like you would've thought they got random people off the street to be in this movie.
The voices of the animals were so annoying and sounded like a rip off of Mike Myers. It was like Ryan Reynolds was auditioning for the next Austin Powers 4.
Gemma Arterton's character was a terrible person, but the film acts like we should care about her.
The characters are all idiots. No one ever calls the cops or even acknowledges that people are disappearing that it. No one realizes that Jerry has mental health problems even though it is super obvious he's not all there. No one ever bothered to do a background check on Jerry. Every character besides Jerry makes the worst possible decision, and it's just too unbelievable.
The plot is painfully predictable and slow. There also is no tension as there is never really a feeling that Jerry is going to get caught or the other characters are going to getaway.
Anna Kendrick's skills as an actor are largely wasted. Her character is one denominational and only likes Jerry bassed on his physical looks. And she is so desperate to hook up with him that it comes across as pathetic. To the point, I just wanted to scream at her character.
Also (spoiler) You never kill Anna Kendrick!!
Finally, I know I said the credits are the best part, but overall the ending is underwhelming, and I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel. I was just like that's it?So overall, I would say this movie is a 5 out of 10. It has a lot of problems, but it's worth watching once if for no other reason then to see Anna Kendrick. .",The Voices

I really didn't know what to expect before seeing this film but boy was i pleasantly surprised by what i saw. One thing this film does really well is that when it turns dark, it turns really dark really fast and then it somehow manages to instantly lighten the mood and make you laugh. The comedic elements in this film worked really well and got me to laugh pretty much every time and for a film that gets so dark and depressing at multiple times it is a very good accomplishment. Ryan Reynolds was incredible in this movie, he absolutely nailed his role of a person who is very damaged but also oblivious to what he is doing and has done. It was one of his best performances and was just amazing on screen, which makes me more excited to see his future films. The supporting cast was very good also, especially Anna Kendrick, she also put in an awesome performance and cant wait to see more from her. The overall plot was very well written, there were so many hilarious twists and turns that made this film very unpredictable and a fun experience. In the end i absolutely loved this film, not only did it provide a very dark story it also provided plenty of moments to laugh at and had a very pleasant blend of the two, making this film my favourite of 2015 so far. - 8.6",The Voices
74,stevepat99,"Dark, depressed, shallow study of good looking Ryan psycho guy",1,22 February 2015,"This film tries to be way too many things. Ryan from the get-go does not play any sort of average likable Joe. At least from our viewing point it is clear from the start that Ryan is playing one very sick puppy while surrounded by voices, we know all too well are his and his alone, coming from his four legged friends. The synopsis mentions that the story""...takes a sudden, murderous turn..."" but, as noted, from the start we know this is one very sick guy. The synopsis also mentions his court appointed shrink and then there are the 'meds' he is not taking. What is lacking is any real story other then a known psycho going psycho. No back story, no character development, no drama, no suspense and so not for me entertaining. Slasher shocks, OK on that one but not enough for this viewer. This was way too close to garish headlines involving the next door neighbor harboring a murderous psycho pastime. There is very little if anything funny in this film. Cat and dog mouthing a deranged killer's words does not reach the funny bone. All in all a dark, humorless, murderous mess.",The Voices
75,rprince-832-6294,An overall pretty fun dark comedy!,7,14 February 2015,"-The Voices (2015) movie review: -The Voices is a dark comedy about a likable, yet somewhat challenged guy, played by Ryan Reynolds, who tries to win over the affections of one of his coworkers. The only problem is that he is a complete sociopath who hears voices coming from his cat, his dog, a dear, and a head.-I like dark comedies, so yeah, I enjoyed a film about an evil cat manipulating a crazy guy to kill people.-The story was original. To say the least. And it is hard to tell what is going to happen, so that was a plus.-The pace was good, but it did have some trouble wrapping up.-The acting was good. Ryan Reynolds did a pretty fun/good job. He also voiced all the animals, which I did not know until the end. Props for accents. Gemma Arterton was good, and it was nice seeing her in a normal role. And Anna Kendrick was good too.-The characters are all pretty likable. Although you do feel bad for Ryan Reynolds character. And you feel bad for the cat being your favorite character, because he's a manipulative jerk. He's such a funny character though! -There was not a lot of music, but the music that was there was very Tarantino-esque.-There were a few moments where I was like 'Nope. They added that for dramatic effect.' So that took me out of it a bit. There was another moment I was hesitant about, with a very questionable depiction of Jesus, but then I remembered the character was crazy, so yeah.-The Voices would be PG-13, except it is rated-R because of the cat. Really, the cat curses through much of the film, which I found pretty accurate and funny since no other characters do. Just the cat. There is come violence, but most of it is off-screen, and although it suggests one scene, there is no nudity or anything.-The Voices had some things I did not like as much, but all-in-all I had a lot of fun with this dark comedy. If you like dark comedies, The Voices is totally worth checking out for like $6 or under or something. $5 bin. I'll stick with that.",The Voices
76,maximovlE,Utterly Reynolds,10,30 September 2020,"I always try to watch movies, when I can, without knowing anything about them. It's not easy, but on this occasion I managed it. I didn't even know it was Ryan Reynolds until I saw him on the screen. I knew literally nothing.Something about the titles had me expecting it to be low budget and rubbish. That's usually the way when there are multiple cheap extended logo things all shoehorned in before the movie. Then the words on the screen, no decent movie does that any more.Then... is that Ryan Reynolds? Yes, yes it is! Ok, maybe its gonna be good. Ryan Reynolds never does a bad film.I completely expected to be laughing through this movie from that point on. For a while I did, right up until the deer scene. Suddenly I was sat with my mouth wide open staring at the screen and wondering what on earth I was watching.Continuously after that point I was glued to this movie more than any movie in a long while. Nothing in this movie is predictable, and every part of it keeps you wanting to see what's next.As much as I despise the term 'fan,' I am a Ryan Reynolds fan. I like everything I've seen him in and don't think there's much I haven't seen now. So I can't help wondering if, had there been another actor in the lead of this movie, whether I would have liked it at all, because Ryan really did make this character extremely likeable, in a way that only he could. He seems to manage to keep that Ryan charm and yet still very much become the part no matter what that part is.The support in Gemma Arterton & Anna Kendrick was also a great casting. Both actresses were superb and fitted in perfectly. The dynamic between the three seemed completely natural.I'm clearly trying to justify myself here because I feel I shouldn't have liked this movie at all. But I did. Very much so. So watch it, just... not with the kids.",The Voices
77,palavitsinis,No no no! Don't waste your time on this.,1,16 April 2015,"A story about Schizophrenia? No, that's not it. I really sat down and read some of the other reviews before putting mine in writing, just to be on the safe side and be impartial. So, after reading some, I can surely say that this was a really really horrible movie. A waste of my time from the beginning to the end. Lousy depiction from Ryan Reynolds. Lousy acting. I did not see any black humor whatsoever, apart from a couple of scenes that were actually funny. Apart from that, the script was junk with no interesting findings or characters. Schizophrenia is not as simple as that. It's not as superficial and it's not as funny. He completely failed to get across the nature of someone having to cope with this disease. Lousy ending to the movie as well. All the other actors were also boring to death. Plot holes were occurring again and again. Photography was OK, but other than that, the movie had no climax, no ups and downs, nothing. It was amazingly flat and uninteresting, keeping you questioning why you chose to see it in the first place. I am not a person to stop a movie once it has started. I have done it with 2-3 over a period of 20 years and this one almost became the fourth one... I am really really sorry that I have wasted my time with this movie.

78,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.,7,9 November 2015,"The Voices (Australian DVD Release)Looking at this title, it's got nothing to do with the popular reality television show but I can admit that this film won't be everyone's cup of tea unless you love your comedies to be dark and really have an adult tone to it. This film features not only a great performance by Ryan Reynolds, but it features a good attempt in terms of story, character development and production value.The film follows an upbeat man named Jerry (Reynolds ) who works at a bathtub factory, and lives in a modified apartment above a bowling alley with his dog Bosco and his cat, Mr. Whiskers (both voiced by Reynolds). Jerry is a man with an innocent, almost child-like demeanour, and suffers from delusions and hallucinations that manifest in the form of his pets talking to him. Bosco often represents his good intentions while Mr. Whiskers represents his more violent nature. One day, his manager compliments his hard work and chooses him to help organize an employee barbecue, and he gladly accepts the opportunity to work with a British woman named Fiona (Gemma Arterton) who Jerry has an awkward crush on. The following day he asks her out on a date. She initially agrees, though with reluctance, but then stands him up to go to a karaoke party with two other girls who work with her in the accounting department at work. From there, it takes Jerry further into his psychological personality and challenges him to embrace his 'sinister' side while fighting to know what his happiness is.What I could take from the film is the fact that the story's protagonist can be seen as a likable or hated character, either way we can see that his journey explores into his dark past and yet at times during the film we are given moments of dark humour; especially from his pets who engage with Jerry with social conversations about whether to be good (Bosco) or to be truly sinister in the world (Mr Whiskers) and at times Jerry himself in the social world. Reynolds is given a really great role and with the script (written by Michael R. Perry) his character is given close detail in development and personality. The supporting cast features the talents of Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick and fellow Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (from Silver Linings Playbook) and more, they are given great moments and they handle themselves well in the film, aiding in the darkly tale of Jerry's schizophrenia.Looking at now direction and production value, it's directed by graphic novelist Iranian-born French Marjane Satrapi who gives the film a fairy tale vibe but for adults and exploring the themes of schizophrenia, identity, love and the will to be the better or worse man. Having know for her illustrative works and children's books. Satrapi's take on the genre is truly great but it won't be taken afar if the viewer doesn't like his or her films dark and yet comedic. Cinematography is dark and convincing like if it's a horror film thanks to Maxime Alexandre (The Hills Have Eyes, P2), he manages to make the darker side of Jerry's personality really grim and can balance the lighter side to Jerry's good persona.Overall, The Voices is funny, dark, driven to that balance horror and comedy with such aplomb you forget that what's happening on the screen isn't exactly healthy or good. Thanks to the talents of it's director, screenwriter and wonderful cast, it's worth a look into if you admire darkly themed comedy/horrors with adult tones and themes.3.5/5 - Nick",The Voices
79,paul_3-960-896774,The funny phantasmagorical serial killer movie,8,9 March 2015,"A minute after the trailer for The Voices started I wanted to see the film. So I was waiting for it to premiere in Paris. I hoped that more of the cast would come but I was glad to see Marjane Satrapi. I know Reynolds is shooting Deadpool so he gets a pass, as for Aterton I know she has her musical but London is a mere two hour train ride away she could have made an effort. Anyway, Satrapi quickly spoke about how the movie came about. Persepolis and her Oscar nomination for it changed her life. Her American agent offered a lot of projects that she wasn't feeling but to me it sounds like they sort of put her in a box. But The Voices was different and refreshing from what she had dine so far, so she went for it and in my opinion it was a good decision.The movie is hilarious, quirky and very entertaining. The Voices could be a mix between Dexter and a good comedy. It's charming and pulls you into the madness with a wicked sense of humor. The director did an amazing job in delivering a good horrish comedy. I expected the comedy but I was surprised by how dark and depressing the movie gets. The focus shifts between reality and fantasy, which makes for very colorful shots that lightens the mood. Bosco, the dog, and Mr. Whiskers, the cat, are just gems. They are the movie's representation of the devil and the angel appearing over a cartoon character's shoulders. They simply steal the movie, that's how funny they are. So The Voices is colorful and dark at the same time. It gets real but it's fun. It has a very serious mental illness at the center of it but there are a lot of hilarious twists that gives a unique look at Schizophrenia.Ryan Reynolds is amazing as the sweet-faced, socially awkward Jerry. He gave an amazing performance in this film in all of his roles, because he has several in this movie, he's really good. He showed a nice range in his acting ability. The cast in general elevated the movie. Gemma Aterton, Anna Kendrick, Jacki Weaver were all great in the movie, they each brought something to the table and made the experience worthwhile. @wornoutspines",The Voices
80,AscendeSuperius,An absolutely tragic film I am confused about,6,18 September 2021,"In a way it was really odd. Given its perspective of the antagonist, it makes one so conflicted. On one hand he has done unspeakable horrors, but at the same time you see how it isn't really his fault but the circumstances that he was put in that drove him to insanity, it makes one pity him. Moreover, given his already broken mind, you see his perspective on things, complicated by his garbled mind. This all culminates in a unique and interesting albeit jumbled watch.However, this film does has many places for example. The most glaring for example, is the lack of any proper development of anyone other than the main guy. While I understand where this is coming from, his lackluster development does leaves one wanting for more, especially for greater emphasis to be placed on the victims for a more balanced storyline.",The Voices

82,DanLives1980,"Oh, The Irony...",9,15 July 2015,"The irony of watching a movie and thinking to yourself ""you couldn't make this up!"" S many Ryan Reynolds movies have pained me over the years, mostly because he should be the type of guy who can do no wrong, but so many of his films are badly received, unlike this one which is criminally underlooked.Not only will I hail this as his best film (until Deadpool), it's also got to be his best acting to date, and then the movie is so surreal - drawing a comedy and psycho thriller parallel and yet never allowing those lines to truly cross - that watching it might make you question your own sanity. I know I did! To cut it short, because to analyse it would take forever (and ruin it for you) 'The Voices' is a weird blend of 'Psycho', 'Dexter,' 'The Evil Dead' and 'Pushing Daisies' with the same colourful and cheerful yet eerie disposition of the latter and also of that other rare oddity of late 'Small Apartments.' It's a very small film that benefits from its smallness while sporting the talents of Reynolds, Gemma Arterton and Anna Kendrick to name a few and is so seamlessly directed, written and filmed that you'd think it's simple enough to follow, but that's where it surprises you with curve-balls aplenty.If you want a movie that will strike you dumb with disbelief and yet will entertain so much that you just have to watch to the end, this is for you.Pleasantly surprised!",The Voices
83,just_in_case,They didn't make it for you.,6,2 January 2016,"I think film is a lot like art. There's films that are made for you. You know like Fast and furious or Independence Day or hell the new Star Wars movie. Its like a group of people were paid to make a movie to sell to people who would want to see that kind of movie. The best ones are ones that are that the production team wanted to make anyway and are happy to do it. You know like avatar or aliens or anything made by Pixar since the Disney take over. Then there's movies like Pacific Rim or Looper or Usual Suspects. A team wants to make a movie finds money to make it and they want to make a movie you can enjoy and they can sit down and watch with you and ask ""Hey man what'd you think what should I do differently next time?"".The voices isn't either of those. Some people got together and made a movie because they wanted to. I'd bet anything they fully expected it to fail and that wasn't the point. I think this was a kind of trial run and somehow Ryan Reynolds got involved because he's been testing himself and at the same time building his portfolio of characters he can play.The cinematography is great the acting is great, the story is mostly good. This is a respectable film that can't even be called Indie or microbudget. On the surface its fine. You're going to leave unsatisfied and a little disappointed, but of capable of telling people it sucks. The film just lacked a twist or revelation that gives you something think about. Ryan has a gradually breakdown throughout the film, you get some story and reason and clearly some people die. Then the movie ends. Thats it. Sadly this is not Silence of the lambs or Serial Mom. There's just nothing explosive or climactic about it. Its just kind of funny and kind of sad and then its over. Nothing more to say except ""wow"" on Ryan Reynolds part. After seeing chaos and buried and the one where his daughter is kidnapped(sorry title eludes me) he once again shows us hes a perfect everyman and in a bad way.

I like dark and twisted humor, so I figured this would be right up my alley. Unfortunately, the movie only managed to get the dark and twisted part. It failed at the humor. The tone shifted from goofy to serious too often for it to be funny. It didn't know what it wanted to be. It would try and be funny after coming off a serious scene and the shift in tone really ruined the movie. It was so jarring every time it happened. That was actually the only problem. Shame it destroyed the movie. It could have been so good. I will say this, however. The foul mouthed cat in this movie cracked me up a little. He's not a exceptionally hilarious character, but seeing a cat swear a lot and talk about how killing things made him feel alive made me chuckle.

However, I slightly disagree that the film has been named a comedy, as I was not tickled in a laugh out loud situation what so ever. Although, the film is not a total loss yet, we still find an intriguing and absorbing story that will keep the viewer to the very end.Sadly I cannot judge the critics who have described the film to be 'overwhelmingly dislike-able'. I think this is a film which may look attractive in the trailers but let the audience down at the end. On the other hand, the film to me looks like the possible scenario, and world that real life mental serial killers may lead.

His two main communicators are his dog and his cat... And they're like a couple of good and bad angels perched on his shoulders... The canine compliments him and wants him to live a good and honest life, whereas the feline belittles him at every opportunity and tries to convince him to kill for pleasure. Judging by the poster, guess who he chooses to listen to?At first, I thought 'Voices' was going to be a simple minded fun comedy about a nerdy Doctor Dolittle character... Well, it turns out the laughs are several shades blacker than that, and you'd have to be a sick man indeed to find some of this material funny. (Hmm... should I call the mental hospital now)? But it's almost surprisingly poignant... As we find out about Jerry's past, we discover his mother had a similar affliction, and his father hated both of them. And one day he found himself out in the community... No real support... Free to indulge his murderous delusions.A withering dismissal of America's policy towards the mentally ill? Or just a mildly disturbing dark comedy about a troubled life?

It's crazy that Jerry was so crazy and psychotic, but because of Reynolds great acting, the character was still very likeable, even when he was chopping people (who didn't deserve to die) to bits. When things go bad for Jerry, you sympathize with him, even though he's a maniac. Speaking of maniac, this movie kinda reminded me of a comedic version of Maniac.

I didn't watch that many movies about serial killers so please forgive me if I say that Jerry is one of the best in my list. Dexter will always hold first place in my mind but just like Dexter no matter what you feel about serial killers both these characters make you feel sorry for them. I mean given their background they were doomed from the start. I do wish that Jerry didn't have to kill Lisa and they lived happily ever after with him disposing of the body of his previous victim and taking his pills that stops his psychotic episodes but this was more realistic.

89,drael64,A twisted and lacking in insight meditation without much comedy,5,6 April 2015,"I am not really sure what to say having watched this film.The acting is great. The lead is spectacularly creepy and innocent at the same time.The plot is quirky, odd. Unlike say death at a funeral, this for me misses most of the laughs, apart from the odd quirky chuckle.And at the same time, it makes some unsightful inferences about schizophrenia. The fear for one is lacking. The niavety and shadowed thinking is without dramatic substance. Perhaps this suits a lighter comedic style, but it at the same time smears mud on a phenomena already poorly understood and feared.In short, as an aside (because its also not very funny IMO, and lacking in stylistic cohesion or direction) this film is deeply offensive to those with mental illness. Which ranks probably a lot worse than hating on Jewish people, given what those people and their families often go through. The best lines of the movie, about the voices everyone hears, caused me to raise this from a 4, to a 5. Those where the best lines of the movie. Indeed, if that had been a dramatic focus (again confused direction/style), it could have been amazing. Perhaps the writers should have written a light hearted but thought provoking exploration of mind, in a set-up or context they better understood personally. Maybe a 'mental break', or something a little more related to their own experiences. It's always better to write about something you understand. A city where you live. A life you lead, or that of a person you know well. It's clear the writers knew little about their subject material. It could have been both funny, and expanding. As it is, its either funny to those without much taste (IMO), or kind of horrific to those with empathy or life experience (with the odd laugh when it occasionally hits a proper dark comedy note).",The Voices

This is dark comedy at some of its finest. It's meant to be disturbing while also making you feel guilty for laughing at the film's irony. It's great. I wouldn't recommend it to certain people that may be effected by the strain of serious mental illness, whether it's loved ones of people that suffer from afflictions or the actual people suffering from them... I don't think thats it's intended audience. But I will say that even though this comedy is dark, and sometimes disturbing, it does help one understand the insane logic of people suffering from certain types of delusions and hallucinations. That's what gives it a great suspenseful horror vibe. A very nice blending of genres. Ryan Reynolds gives a great performance as a lovable naive insane person. He's very well cast here. The direction is great in this movie. I love seeing movies directed by women because their films always feel super fresh, because, let's face it, there are way more men directing movies out there than women, which is kind of bull crap. Seeing films from a different perspective is awesome, and this film really feels original in its design. I thought it was pretty great. The end credit sequence might have been a little too much for my taste... but I see why they did it that way. Not really a complaint, but it might be nice to see something light hearted that didn't quite go on as long in the movies end. Still a great movie and a great ending.

93,kaaber-2,A very good year for Ryan Reynolds,10,2 August 2018,"Egoyan's ""The Captive"" together with ""The Voices"" from that same year, 2014, are very fine examples of Reynold's less-is-more style of acting. While in ""Captive"" he seems to be doing almost nothing and is disguised behind a full beard, Reynolds reverts to his boy-next-door appearance in ""The Voices"", and switches effortlessly from comedy into tragedy, or rather: he underplays comedy and turns it into tragedy - a very, very hard thing to do, and he comes through with flying colours. One scene deserves a special mention. His reaction to the two-minute psycho-analysis delivered by his therapist who is talking for dear life while tied up on the hood of his car; serial killer Jerry's cathartic moment. It is absolutely priceless.
Of course, Reynolds is greatly assisted by a great script and a wonderful cast. Even the animals are good. The film as such is a gem, and the Bollywood-like ending is reminiscent of Dennis Potter's very sombre depression-era jukebox musical ""Pennies from Heaven"".",The Voices

This is certainly not for everyone, the comedy in this one is very dark and if you like that you will definitely be enjoying yourself. The film starts off nice and slow and then takes quite a dark turn, well quite a few actually and merges comedy, schizophrenia and bloody violence in a very original way. Acting from Ryan Reynolds is really good as he managed to portray this crazy character in such a way that it is really hard not to like him despite his mind going completely off the rails and him doing horrible things to some really nice people.

Man, when is Ryan Reynolds going to be good in a good movie, instead of good in junk? He's pretty good in this, but it's an awkward genre (comedy with serial killing? Can't think of one that actually worked). Great work by Gemma Arterton (so good she takes you right out of the comedy to wrenching horror), with Anne Kendrick who is so personable and nice. All of them wasted in this misguided effort.It would be hard to ID the blame for the mess this film is. There were some genuinely funny moments (Ryan Reynolds almost can't not be funny), but then there would be a jarring change of tone to slasher horror and well-acted scenes of people suffering their last moments. And then some none-bloody stuff that was cleverly done and authentically creepy. And then it would veer back to some slasher film, while the end credits, an almost Bollywood dance number with a little Christian mockery, feel like WTF filler.I saw a comedian tell a joke once that went: ""They captured this serial killer and he said the Voices made him kill all those people. I've always wondered, why don't the voices say 'Go Dancing?' "" That would have been a movie worth seeing. This, on the other hand, was a waste of my time, and sadly for the talented people on screen, a waste of their time, too. AVOID.",The Voices
99,MoviesReviews101,Verdict: Delightfully Dark Comedy,8,19 March 2015,"The Voices is one of the few comedies I have seen recently that actually made me laugh and that is simply down to the story being able to come off looking serious but use the ideas in a comic tone. We get a very good thriller that tackles serious mental health problems and we also get very real characters that have social problems, misleading woman thinking it is alright to lead a man on and an over flirty person who thinks everyone could be good. Mixing them together we see how normal life can be but add in the two pets who if this was a cartoon one would be an angel the other the devil in a situation where people actually double think before acting. I think this story will go down as one of the better ones of the year and will certainly appeal to the right audience. (8/10)Actor ReviewRyan Reynolds: Jerry the disturbed man who hears voices from his pets, he tries to fall in love with a co-worker but things don't get well and he accidentally kills her. Jerry has to figure out what to do before getting involved with another employee Lisa. Ryan also provides the voices for all the animals including Mr Whiskers the cat and Bosco the dog who try to help him make decisions in his life. Ryan gives a great performance showing his full range of emotions and comic timing throughout this film. (9/10)Gemma Arterton: Fiona co-worker who leads Jerry along because she thinks she is better than everyone else. She uses Jerry when she needs to and ends up getting killed by him, before continuing to talk to him from beyond the grave. Gemma gives a good performance in a supporting role. (7/10)Anna Kendrick: Lisa co-worker who is interested in Jerry and ends up getting involved with him and she could be the one to get him to solve the problems he is having. Anna goes well in the supporting role playing a character we are used to seeing her in. (7/10)Jacki Weaver: Dr Warren who is Jerry therapist who is trying to make sure that he stays strong through the mental health problems he is suffering through. Jacki does well in the supporting role. (7/10)Support Cast: The Voices doesn't have the biggest supporting cast we only have the odd appearance from fellow co-workers.Director Review: Marjane Satrapi – Marjane does a great job directing this dark comedy that really works on so many different levels. (8/10)Comedy: The Voices has a brilliant level of comedy used throughout mostly in the dark level though. (8/10) Crime: The Voices enters into a crime world once Jerry starts killing people even if they are accidental at first. (8/10) Thriller: The Voices really does keep you guessing as you don't know how Jerry can keep getting away with what he has done as well as guessing who will die next. (9/10) Settings: The Voices puts us in a small town showing how everyone knows everyone else and when people start going missing no one knows who to suspect. (8/10) Suggestion: The Voices is going to be a film I suggest seeing but if you don't like dark comedy you won't like this one. (Watch) Best Part: Bosco thinking Jerry has crossed a line. Worst Part: It won't be the right film for certain people. Funniest Scene: Bosco hearing the door knocking.Believability: No (0/10) Chances of Tears: No (0/10) Chances of Sequel: No Post Credits Scene: NoOscar Chances: No Runtime: 1 Hour 43 MinutesOverall: I honestly have to say this is one of the funniest films I have seen in recent years, it manages to become a dark version of Doctor Dolittle but maintain the humour.Check out more reviews at http://moviesreview101.com/",The Voices
100,CrisMovieCorner,Reynolds at his best!,8,11 July 2015,"Firstly let's start with the cast, the decision to cast Ryan Reynolds in role was an inspired one he is a truly talented actor that not many people get the chance to see actually act. His roles in ""Buried"" and ""Safe House"" I can't recommend any higher, same goes for this, playing Jerry Hickfang he disturbingly felt at home. Reynolds played the character so well that there was times the viewer is dragged in deep into illusion of lost connection with reality. Gemma Arterton and Anna Kendrick play Hickfang's unwilling accomplices, Arterton was a wonderful comedic break from the dark story Kendrick on the other hand I personally struggle to enjoy not sure what it is, this time she has won me over playing the smitten Lisa she was a fun addition to the cast. Then we get to Reynolds voicing Bosco the dog and Mr Whiskers obviously the cat, some of the lines for these characters were so hilariously executed by Reynolds you actually fall in love with them even if Mr Whiskers is a bit on the naughty side. The entire cast were thoroughly enjoyable.This is the first film I have seen by director Marjane Satrapi and if this if anything to go by I am quiet sure I will be following her career for a long time. She blends perfectly the highs and lows of a Jerry's struggle between reality and imagination, be it from the belly laughs you get from Mr Whiskers and Bosco to the rock bottom lows of Jerry's realisation of the real world. Satrapi succeeds in keeping you entertained from start to end, in regards to the end don't skip the credits you're in for a wonderfully funny treat which I did not expect but loved.Onto the story, people constantly complain about Hollywood being lazy and constantly remaking the same stuff, this film is certainly NOT the case. Writer Michael R Perry (""The River"" TV show & ""Paranormal Activity 2"") really excels in making something new and fresh his character development and witty written conversations between Jerry and his pets were incredible, not only did he write something extremely funny, he writes a script in which we really get to see Reynolds perform his best role to date in my opinion.Overall, I found the film to be wonderfully funny was a brilliant mix of dark and light Comedy, Marjane Satrapi does very well at blending the two into one cohesive mix. This film is the perfect film for any fan of the black comedy genre, everything coming together from Reynolds superb performance, to the pacing of the film to hilarious retorts by Mr Whiskers and Bosco you're in for 103 minutes of pure fun. In short I absolutely loved this film, I couldn't recommend it any higher to Reynolds fans or just Comedy/Horror lovers in general. Plus it gives us an insight into what Reynolds can do with a disturbed character with a warped view of reality, *cough* Deadpool *cough*.",The Voices
101,TheBarleyGuy,Effective and darkly funny.,7,18 December 2015,"Having already proved that she could combine drama and comedy with her comic, and animated film Persopolis, I was fairly sure this would at the very least be a competently made movie. Fortunately, my faith in Marjane Satrapi was well placed, and even Ryan Reynolds managed to surprise me in this one. Admittedly, there were one or two jokes in the movie that I could have done with out. Prison rape being the subject of one of those jokes. Overall though, the tone and feel kinda worked.Reynolds gives a surprisingly good performance as Jerry, Mr. Whiskers and Boscoe (yes, he voices his pets in this one, which totally makes sense) and his portrayal of a guy on the brink of his full psychotic break is really effective. A lot of the time he has this goofy innocence to him, but there are a few moments of real anger that remind you how dangerous this man really is. Particularly near the end when Jerry returns to his psychiatrists office, there is something really tense and frightening about it, and that scene really brought the movie home for me.One thing that might have been interesting would have been seeing more of the reality of Jerry's world. We see how disgusting and awful his apartment is when he takes his medication and returns to the real world, but it was hard to know if that reality extended into the rest of his life or not. The medication gave his life a rosy glow and everything seemed pretty good, so it might have been interesting to see that play out in his work place. With that said, it was effective enough in telling the story, and I'm not all that upset about it.Anna Kendrick is great, and adorable, as Lisa and Gemma Arterton is very enjoyable too. Plus, you can't ignore the great presence that is Jackie Weaver (Stoker). The whole cast turns in pretty solid performances honestly, even the dog and cat actors are great.It does suffer from the stumbling block of trying to make your main character both likable and a serial killer, and as a result a weird line is walked between him being evil and not. His first two killings start off as accidents that he ""fixes"", and so they do try and make sure you don't hate him, even though it's clear that he is deranged and a murderer.Overall though, the movie does work with the dark tone it sets, and manages to be a pretty fun black comedy. Reynolds is charming, it's pretty well directed, and his performance as himself and all of his delusions was an interesting thing to watch. Check it out.www.barleydoeshorror.com",The Voices
102,sforrester-3,I liked it.,8,5 May 2015,"I wasn't expecting a great deal from this but was pleasantly surprised. I do like Ryan Reynolds and I think he played this perfectly, giving the slightly comedic element whilst still portraying someone suffering from extreme mental health problems. Showing us the difference between the medicated and unmedicated character was well done and although there were one or two points I would question, overall the balance was handled well. I liked that the character had a well thought out back story and his desire to be ""normal"" as well as the torture that he couldn't be really came across. I would give this one a go if you enjoy quirky films with a bit of an edge.",The Voices
103,ArdentViewer,Pointless,4,20 February 2017,"I wanted to like this movie. Ryan Reynolds is usually quite appealing. He is a great actor, but even he couldn't save this pointless film. The premise was interesting and the opening was promising, but the film fell flat for me after Fiona's demise. He was connecting with Lisa, but then she was killed, and Allison soon followed suit. And for what? There's only so much you can get out of hoarding (which, by the way, was never explained), dismembered body parts, and blood and guts smeared everywhere. The talking dog and cat were frankly obnoxious, and the psychiatrist was useless. You know the patient's history and know how important the meds are, and yet you halfheartedly ask him if he is taking them? You note that he appears troubled and do nothing. No follow-through. Why even bother having the character? And I kept waiting for some sort of resolution at the end, but it never happened. He *finally* gets caught at the 11th hour. Okay. You'd think someone might have connected the dots a bit sooner given his obvious feelings for Fiona and his suspicious behavior following her disappearance. Lisa knew how he felt, as did Allison, but no one was concerned? And the cops weren't, either? And at the end, Jerry allowed himself to die, and awoke to a song-and- dance routine with his dead mother and the girls he killed? This was ridiculous, not funny. The film was worthless.",The Voices
104,dimbost,"a too serious of a story and take to be put in ""dark comedy"" didn't work",5,5 June 2015,"The Voices tries to tackle a serious issue schizophrenia with some comedic moments so as to not turn away its viewers. Just like Death at funeral (England)or 50/50 are good example of dark comedy. The Voices is not. I gave it 5 stars for effort and Ryan's Acting.The film's story is about schizophrenic guy who likes a girl and decides to way off his pills to live in a happy place instead of the dark, sad world that he is in. For most part we are shown the happy place instead of the real world, but we are then thrown into the real world for few seconds of his state of mind, and it is disturbing. Also as much as the movie tries to sway us to make Ryan a likable and a sorry character for which we want to forgive, it fails and we end up just hating this character and are left sitting there waiting for the film to finish and for him to get caught. The only ones that you feel sorry for are the pets, as in the instance when we are shown the real world we see the Dog and Cat almost be hugging each other while in close proximity with their own feces. Clearly showing signs of being mistreated by or simply not cared for by their master.The Acting by Ryan is great, and there are some average acting moment by other Actors, but not to much to say that this was a poor movie, however the only downfall is the way the film tried to incorporate its horror and comedy into the film through shock and gore.",The Voices

This is a seriously dark and disturbing movie which delves into the mind of a deranged serial killer. What disturbs me equally as much is the way this film is marketed and advertised. It's made to look more like a comedy but I can assure you that there is nothing funny about this movie. It's Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer on Ecstasy. There is nothing enjoyable about this film. It's very well made and I can believe that this is how someone with this kind of mental illness sees the world and lives their life but don't be fooled but the sugar coating given to the poster and the trailer.,The Voices
107,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,One of the Best Movies Of The Year,8,26 May 2015,"The Voices is a dark comedy starring Ryan Reynolds, Gemma Arterton and Anna Kendricks. It is directed by Marjane Satrapi and is written by Michael R. Perry. The Voices is about a schizophrenic man, Jerry(Ryan Reynolds), who constantly hears voices, sometimes from animals and sometimes from inanimate objects like socks. He currently works at a bathtub factory and loves his life. All is well until he falls head over heels in love with a co-worker, Fiona(Gemma Arterton). And that is precisely where things go insanely funny, sad, exciting and most prominent of all enthralling. Lead by a stellar, award worthy performance, by Ryan Reynolds this movie amazed me. Before hand I believed Reynolds was a novelty actor and I hope with this movie he pushes himself for the gold(Oscar). Equally good if not better was the writing. Since the whole movie surrounds a schizophrenics activities with his ""voices,"" it was crucial that these small conversations with a cat or with a dog be entertaining and God be my witness they were. It is practically how amazingly funny some of these scenes are. Before I give my final rating I just wanted to state this is a dark and morbid comedy so if you don't like these American Psycho kinds of movies you're going to hate this.

With the help of his court-appointed psychiatrist, he pursues his office crush. However, the relationship takes a sudden murderous turn when he listens guided by his evil talking cat and benevolent talking dog.This movie is like Psycho for a new generation. It has a unique blend of comedy, horror, heartbreak and suspense which keeps you wanting more. Ryan Reynolds gives one of his best performances in a while. He turns on the charm and the fear, to the point where he becomes Jerry and you are whisked away into the mind and madness of the character. Ryan Reynolds also does the voices of the talking animals which are unforgettable and Reynolds is amazing as each one.The story is similar to ones we have seen before but The Voices has a unique charm about it. With just the right blend of horror and comedy, I felt like I couldn't get enough of this film. Marjane Satrapi did a amazing job directing The Voices. The change between reality and what Jerry perceives when he is not on his meds is stunning, fun and freighting all at once.The Voices is a fun and twisted movie which is another reason to look for uncommon independed films.

This is one of those movies when you watch it you will want to stop the movie and regret not stopping it. The serial killer keeps human heads in his refrigerator.

I didn't come close to laughing in the movie.",The Voices
115,rosanna-83335,Strangely truthful in some ways,9,10 June 2020,"First Ryan Reynolds is brilliant in this role. The depiction of the good guy just in a bad psychological situation and the navigation between the two states of mind were brilliantly portrayed.
RR suffers from psychosis. He may be scizophreniac but frankly does not show any other symptoms. He basically hears voices (dog who represents his ""good"" self and cat the ""bad"" self) and has hallucinations. Typically when he is off his meds like he is most of the movie everything is beautiful and smells good while on the meds, he sees reality. The viewer sees the world as he sees it.
Our main character is basically a good guy he hates his meds as his vision of the world without them is so much nicer. I know for having had a friend who was on Th is type of meds that she would say the same. She also stopped taking them. She also missed her visions and talking to her ""friends"" (She was not dangerous). He wants to stay good but there is that part of him that wants to be bad. In most it would be subconscious and would never cause the person to become a murderer but in his case and in some real cases the subconscious has taken shape and the person no longer understands or has a real grip on reality so when that voice is constantly telling them they need to kill or do bad things they may fight it but some people like our protagonist end up following the voice. That is all very serious but This film is made with plenty of humour and comedic moments mixed in with some gorey bits. It's not scary but it's not your family comedy for sure. It's a light horror comedy. I really enjoyed it and fully recommend it.",The Voices

It is deeply disturbing and I feel like whoever wrote it needs some serious help. It was an unfunny, gruesome, dark, twisted, poorly written, disturbing steaming pile of garbage. There was an extreme lack of character development. The acting was awful. The writing was attempting to be funny, but was instead just deeply disturbing. The plot was all over the place. The sets made no sense. It was a random hodgepodge of disturbing and borderline demonic scenes that were in no way relatable and included no deep underlying messages.

117,lizshotter-19401,Good and bad,8,23 June 2019,"This film is a surprisingly accurate portrayal of someone who experiences voices and unusual beliefs. But it's disappointing that it portrays people with mental health problems going on to murder people. Having worked with people who live with the conditions shown (schizophrenia, dissociative identity, depression) they're more often a threat to themselves. The scarier people I've worked with, who've never been diagnosed with anything, have been the ones who've committed vicious murders. But ryan Reynolds is excellent in his portrayal, particularly as he played the voices of the animals. The part where he starts taking his meds and can see life as it actually is was very poignant. Many of the guys I work with say they miss their voices and unusual beliefs, as they've helped them with some really tough parts of their lives, but they're (rightfully?) forced to take their meds. It was a funny, sad and acerbic film and I thought it really went under the radar when it came out.",The Voices

As usual, Ryan Rynolds is a likable lead. His performance and portrayal of mental illness really sticks out with some good exploration of his twisted past and bleak every day reality, originating a simpathetic character that needs help more than condemnation. The movie is greatly elevated by Rynolds performance, almost a solo one, especially looking at the rather flat supporting characters.

Preferably alive.This is one of those films where quality goes up and down from scene to scene like a roller coaster. Except that in this case its somehow appropriate and fitting because it is about a mental illness. In some scenes you see Ryan's character not take med's and what things really look like, and then you understand why he stops taking them.This would have made for a probably OK B-budget horror slasher.

120,death-hawk1,Americans Succeed at Black Comedy?,6,19 June 2015,"Previously I have never seen an American film billed as a 'Black Comedy' which succeeded to fulfill on its promise. Anything described as a black comedy and coming from America could only ever be a tragedy when viewed and would be thus vastly disappointing in my opinion. This compared of course to British comedies of the same vein, for example the final series of 'Blackadder' or 'Sean of the Dead.' However 'The Voices' managed to deliver a definite comic element despite the grisly subject matter and tragedy of mental illness.Ryan Reynolds convincingly performs the well meaning, bemused yet dangerously unstable Jerry as well as delivering great voice acting for all the ""voices"" by which Jerry is tormented. Reynolds is supported by a cast of competent actors and the plot isn't complicated enough to detract from the sad situation in which Jerry finds himself or the darkly sinister comedy which pervades the film.Hopefully this heralds a new era in American film making and we can see new films of this ilk in the near future.In summary, a light hearted if dark film with some confident if not brilliant acting throughout. A solid 6.5/10. Not bad for a comedy.",The Voices
121,ghostjunk,He's a great guy. Just ask his pets!,7,18 July 2015,"Jerry's just your average guy. He works a 9 to 5, owns a trailer home and has 2 talking pets. Aside from his regular therapy sessions and, well, the talking pets, I guess you could say he leads a pretty simple life. Or at least things used to be this way, until he falls in love with his beautiful co-worker, sending him down a very twisted and violent path.Marking her live-action directorial debut, Marjane Satrapi wastes no time proving she's a force to be reckoned with outside her roots in animation. Seldom do we see someone take on such a controversial script and present it with so much style, inventiveness and strong attention to detail. From the simple yet effective use of animation in the title sequence to the seamless use of colors through the sets and wardrobes, no subtleties are missed towards creating its offbeat tones. This can't go without mentioning the clever use of practical effects and her choice to use real animals rather than take the easy route of creating them with CGI. As bizarre as some of the scenes can be, The Voices has enough artistic integrity infused in its core to attain a sense of believability that helps you stay engaged the whole way through.I suppose it's safe to say that a lot of things contributed to the quality of this film, but it obviously wouldn't have worked without the amazing talents of Ryan Reynolds. Not only does he flawlessly lend his voice to the hilarious taking animals, he somehow manages to bring a genuine likability to his roll as the world's nicest serial killer. Thankfully our socially awkward protagonist is given just enough character development for us to truly understand where he's coming from and why he's so, well, weird.At no point does the story ever try to hide the grim violent reality behind all of the quirky humor it predominantly portrays either. Nor does it ever lose its balance in tone and fall victim of an identity crisis, like most dark comedies tend to do. The Voices might be a little too bizarre for most, but regardless of how people feel about it, there's no question that this is one provocative screenplay that will gain lots of well-deserved attention.",The Voices

Ryan's performance completely made this movie and he brought so much appeal to it, and that's all that matters.

The heavenly scene at the end gives no insight, no lessons learned, just let's all be happy no matter how many sick things this man has done.

There is no doubt that Jerry is bat guano crazy, and he really should be stopped...but you don't want to see him harmed.It's too real and surreal at the same time...and the closing credits are fantastic.I get why people might hate it. It is very polarizing but charming as well. There's no way to properly convey the essence of this movie. You'll just have to see it for yourself.

126,leonthesleepy,We all hear the voices sometimes...,10,29 December 2015,"What is The Voices? Its a darkly funny, hilarious film that has a surprising amount of emotional depth and empathy. It is also a criminally underrated movie, that is one of the real surprises from 2014. One of my favorite things about it was discovering what kind of film this really was, so i will be VERY vague in this review.Ryan Reynolds stars as Jerry, a sweet but awkward man working in a toilet factory. One day he works up the courage to pursue his office crush. Oh, and of course, he hears voices.The performances here are uniformly excellent, with Reynolds in particular doing some of his best work to date. I admit i never though much about him as an actor but here, he is equal parts hopelessly naive, infectiously upbeat, and tragic as Jerry. Thats all i will say about that.Suffice to say, the movie deals with coming to terms with reality, and The Voices takes a very interesting approach in telling this sort of story. Its not a direction i have seen done often and it pulls it off brilliantly, without ever shying away from the hard moments. Because make no mistake, it can be disturbing in an understated way.It stays true to the character of Jerry to the end, and despite its subject matter, it was a blast to watch! Its a smale scale movie that hits hard and has some surprising emotional depth to it.If you can take some violence, and are open to trying something new, DO NOT give this one a miss! Its a real gem of a movie.",The Voices

We all know that it started from the Hitchcock movie Psycho (I mean the horror psychological movies) . For the acting of him and Gemma and Ana Kendrick I give nine out of ten because all of them acted brilliantly. Gemma did not got a chance to act for a long duration but she did great. Ana is as usual nice . But in my opinion this movie will be remembered for Ryan's performance. I do not know why it got an average rating , should have got more numbers . I think it's a lost treasure but there are many examples of movies like that where although actors and actresses did great , movie got an average rating .",The Voices
128,alan-lohf,What the......,1,21 June 2019,"Okay, I give in. What was Ryan Reynolds thinking when he signed up for this lemon? This film is absolute garbage. A guy talks to his cat and dog, who talk back, dismembers women for no clearly discernible reason and puts their heads in his refrigerator. That makes sense .... actually, no it doesn't! Is this a horror film? Well, it makes no attempt to shock or terrify, so that's a no. Is it a comedy? It that was the intention, it didn't just miss the bulls-eye, it missed the entire dart board! At the risk of repeating myself, this film is drivel - avoid it, your time would be better spent watching paint dry!",The Voices
129,mattwilde123,The Voices,8,6 March 2017,"'The Voices' is a very dark comedy from graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi. It tells the story of a man named Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) who works in a bathtub factory. Jerry continuously sees a psychiatrist (Jacki Weaver) as he tries to live a normal life whilst dealing with his mental afflictions. He decides to pursue his office crush (Gemma Arterton) but soon finds himself in a murderous situation when she fails to reciprocate his advances. Jerry's schizophrenia means that he hears voices specifically from his pets who give him help and advice.Satrapi directs the piece with a surprisingly heartfelt and empathetic way. The lack of colour and light (such as when Jerry is on his limiting medication) contrast really well with the scenes where the main character is free and feels at peace. There are very graphic scenes of murder which highlight the brutality of his actions reminding the audience of the morality of Jerry's actions. The music is also very fitting and turns drastically into a horror- themed score when the drama switches.The screenplay is funny in a lot of places. Before I watched the film, I thought I would find similarities with HBO's 'Dexter' as it deals with a likable killer whilst also being humorous. But, after watching, I feel that the film owes a lot to Mary Harron's 'American Psycho' as it shares similar themes of delusion and indulgence. However, the dialogue was a bit forced at times and I usually find myself cringing when watching a British actress (in this case Gemma Arterton) having to read lines written in a very stereotypical way.Ryan Reynolds is fantastic as the main character and really makes the audience feel for his character. Reynolds completely embodies the main character's innocence and is a genuinely nice man. Even more impressive is the fact that Reynolds also performs voices for his pets which include a Scottish cat and a Texan dog. I had a slight problem with other members of the cast who I felt were not quite up to the standard that Reynolds set although Jacki Weaver was great as his psychiatrist and Anna Kendrick did a good job at playing his love interest.Overall, I feel that 'The Voices' was a surprisingly good film. It was funny and very well acted. 'The Voices' is a little hidden gem that a lot of people who are fans of small and strange indie comedies would love. My final rating is 4 stars.",The Voices
130,blossoms-733-387580,Movies about killing women aren't that funny,4,28 February 2015,"I was sickened by the violence against and victimization of women. Had Ryan Reynolds played a serial killer who targeted African American men we would be up in arms about this film being racist and persecuting a minority group. So, why is it okay for his character to kill women? I am deeply disappointed that a Hollywood celebrity of his stature doesn't have the decency and good sense to recognize the sexism in the plot of this story. Women are already victimized in daily life--put into hospitals by violent boyfriends and husbands, applying for restraining orders against stalkers in the thousands, and living in fear of rape and murder. As women we are already forced to navigate through a violent world where female medical students are gang- raped and killed and we are afraid to walk on streets at night. This kind of movie adds insult to injury in its cavalier depiction of murdering and dismembering women. I have yet to see a film about a female serial killer who dismembers men, chops them up, and puts them into ziplock containers. It is only fair. I'll retract this review when I see men butchered up by a woman in such an off-handed way. Until then Reynolds and these production companies need some serious training in sensitivity.",The Voices
131,blinkchester,Reigning Cats & Dogs,8,20 March 2015,"Dark Comedy, Horror, Satirical, ironic and twisted These are just some of the words which can be used to describe Marjane Satrapi's genre bender. After appearing on a list of the best unmade screenplays in 2009, The Voices see's the light of day in 2015.Ryan Reynolds plays Jerry, a schizophrenic loser, a boy trapped inside a man's body, struggling to fit in within a town of averages. An average job in a bathtub factory in a town in which very little ever happens leads to very surreal events. Reynolds is turning out to be one of Hollywood's forgotten stars, turning in a fantastic performance. Deranged yet sympathetic. He is supported by Gemma Arterton, superbly playing the 'office fit' Fiona. Arterton deftly switches between the confident curvaceous leaders of the account ladies, to the vulnerable Brit a long way from home. Even better is Anna Kendrick, as the less noticeable account girl, Lisa. Lisa is everything Fiona is not, she is safe, trusting and passive.This may not be the type of film you would expect to find two of Hollywood's leading ladies in, but nothing about The Voices is straightforward. The plot unfolds through Jerry's deranged viewpoint, blurring the lines between imagination and reality. In Jerry's reality his animals talk to him, cleverly representing the struggle within his personality. Without looking to spoil any surprises, Jerry may be responsible for many evil acts, but this struggle shows him less evil but more sympathetic. Jerry continues to spiral out of control and it is only when we get a glimpse of reality, we see the tortured soul, living above an abandoned bowling alley, away from any human contact and still suffering from aggressive contact from his past.I have heard The Voices described as funny. This is not necessarily misleading advertising. There may not be too many laugh out loud jokes, but the situational comedy is fantastic. The closing credits expertly round off a surreal exaggeration of laughter, but also a touching exploration of mental health.It is no surprise that Reynold's campaigned to lead this film. It will leave you feeling a little uneasy and very unsure. If you're thinking of watching this one, ask your dog first Or maybe your cat",The Voices
132,storm_mica,"Very dark, bitter-sweet journey",8,8 November 2015,"I must admit I loved parts of this movie and other parts I hated; which is not to say they were bad, I simply didn't like some parts because of the emotions they brought to the surface. The voices is a very dark comedy; there were parts which were completely laugh out loud funny (eg: many of mister whiskers' lines) and other parts were tragically serious. I am not a Ryan Reynolds fan (at all) but this could have changed my mind completely, I didn't realise that he had done the voices until I read about it here. Jackie Weaver was outstanding as the psychiatrist American accent and all.What I found outstanding about this movie is that it has very few of the dumbed-down, pathetic and predictable traits of the trite drivel Hollywood peddle as ""comedy"". There was no comparison really. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a thought-provoking, less than predictable adult-oriented movie (ie: people who aren't offended by adult concepts and the f-word).",The Voices
133,scurvytoon,The cat made me write this review,10,9 February 2015,"I've always liked Ryan Reynolds starting with his early Canadian work but even having read the tag line, never in a million years did I see this one coming. What a wonderful surprise. The Voices is a brilliant film about schizophrenia that balances horror and comedy with such aplomb you forget that what's happening on the screen isn't exactly healthy or good. Gemma Arterton joins Mr Whiskers and Bosco in some of the most entertaining internal conflicts to be shown on screen in years. Mr Whiskers hilariously confirms our deepest and darkest fears about cats while Bosco is the voice of reason. Let's be clear about this, Jerry is deeply disturbed and he needs help but that doesn't keep you from being sucked into his strange world. His life in the real world at the bathtub factory hides a whole lot of crazy going on in his head. Jerry at his core is happy there and he likes his co workers, too bad about the little accident that starts it all going down hill.If you like your comedy strange, you too will be a fan of this film. From the basic premise of talking animals to the happy joy joy feeling Jerry gets when his ""problems"" seem to go away, all the way to the end you will be smiling at how good the story is. And what an end, you know it's going there and you know it's all for the best, he's after all a good guy and does the only thing he can. His reward? well you have to watch all the way to the end. But I do promise you this, you'll be wanting to dance to very possibly the most uplifting song since somebody serenaded a man eating plant.Don't let this one pass you by.",The Voices

135,michaelprescott-00547,Deeply unsettling and strange,7,7 April 2021,"I have to appreciate the sheer strangeness of this movie, even if I'm not sure I actually enjoyed it. I'm not even sure it was meant to be enjoyed.While not especially gory by the standards of this type of film, ""The Voices"" includes some imagery that I found profoundly disturbing - chiefly those plastic containers Ryan Reynolds so carefully stacks in his apartment. I almost turned the thing off at that point. But I stuck with it, and I guess I'm glad I did, though I could have done without the goofy, over-the-top sequence that plays under the closing credits.Many others have commented on the clever shifts and pointed contrasts between Reynolds' delusional world view and the ugly reality of his circumstances. What I've found interesting is trying to determine just where his hallucinations end.At one point, he sees a news report that his first victim's body has been found in the woods. The end of the report is clearly hallucinated; the sheriff directly addresses Reynolds through the TV. But when I thought about it afterward, it hit me that the entire news story, from start to finish, must be a hallucination. Reynolds did not leave the body in the woods, so it could not have been found there. All the stuff about the police searching for a serial killer is Reynolds' fantasy. (In fact, there's little indication anyone is even concerned about the missing woman.)Later, after Reynolds has killed two women, one of his' female coworkers comes to check on him. Naturally he kills her, too. I took this to be a real event. But now I have to wonder if the entire incident happened only in his mind. After all, it makes no sense for the coworker to show up at his place; she already knows that two of her colleagues are missing and that Reynolds may be mentally disturbed. So does she actually go there? Or does he just imagine the third murder? How much of what happens on screen ever ""really"" happens at all?Any film that makes you dwell on these questions for a couple of days is worth a watch - if you have the stomach for it. (Those plastic containers ...) Whether it's a ""good movie"" or not is hard to say, but it does stay with you.",The Voices

138,Wrighthead,Simplistic and unrealistic.,2,13 December 2017,This movie had all the right elements on paper but failed to execute many of them well. Look out for Dr. Warren's (Jacki Weaver) monologue towards the end of the film but be prepared to be let down by hammy character acting and a childish plot before you get there.An example of something this film did well was the contrast of perception in Jerry's (Ryan Reynolds) apartment but they could have taken that trope further. I disliked the naive view of Psychology/Medication as it gave the film unrealistic and childish plot progression (it clearly wasn't researched).Overall I wouldn't recommend paying for this movie.

The change of perspective through Jerry's world-view when he is on medication and when not is haunting.This film imparts a disturbing, depressing, graphic horror view into the mind of a psychopath.

A movie group I'm part of wanted to watch it, and this time I doubt I'll be forgetting it again. I don't remember being this moved by it the first watch (my score went from a ""7"" to a ""9""), but it is truly a brilliant film in a class of its own, as it is the perfect blend of horror, comedy, and docudrama, showcasing the struggles the severely mentally ill go through - both on and off of meds - and tugs at the heartstrings in a way that no serial killer in cinema ever has. One thing I remembered about the movie was how much I originally hated the ending (which lead to the drop in scoring), but this time I really see the beauty in it and appreciate it for what it is. For someone who once worked for a community mental health center, there has never been a movie that made me feel so much sorrow for what some of the individuals who came through our doors must have felt (at least on the more shallow end of the spectrum), and this movie will remain a favorite of mine in the dark comedy genre for many years to come.",The Voices

Everyone is happy, and everyone likes him (well, maybe Mr. Whiskers isn't happy, but then Mr. Whiskers is evil). At his core, he is a good person, as personified by his dog, Bosco. However, Bosco can't stop the awful things that happen to Jerry, and Jerry sinks further and further into his illness.This may be the most brilliant performance I've seen Ryan Reynolds give. This kid can act, and since he is also Mr. Whiskers and Bosco, it is one hell of an act. The CG is great in that these are the best talking animals ever.It's more dark than funny, but the funny is hysterical. If you are looking for just funny, this movie is probably not for you.

The story is balanced and builds up very well , I particularly liked the portrayals between meditated reality and non meditated delusional phase, also the background of the character comes out pretty well without following a resume pattern.It is definitely not a classic blood-gore and gloomy horror movie, it is more of a psychological portrayal of the mind of a disturbed guy.Definitely worth your time, especially if you like Ryan Reynolds, this a shining gem of his acting.",The Voices

Now Mr. Reynolds isn't the best actor in the world but this was even beneath his very modest talents. The art direction was abysmal. The direction lacked direction...how ironic.

It's funny without making you laugh all the time, more just delighted by what you're watching. It's scary in the right moments, absurd in the right moments, sad in the right moments. I loved the tone of the film, it's almost like it could sometimes be a musical, but it isn't (except for the credits scene), it's almost a thriller, but it's comedic enough to not get quite there, it's got a really interesting psychological premise, it makes you feel for the character of Jerry even when he's doing horrible things. You feel bad that he's doing those things but almost not really for the victim but for him because you know what doing those things is doing to him as well. 
This just really hit all the buttons I like in a movie like this. I'm extremely impressed with all the voices Ryan does (I didn't realize it was him because it truly sounds nothing like him at all). Ryan did fantastic in this movie, he was awkward, charming, funny, embarrassing, scary, intense, sad, etc. he did it all and did it very well. 
The director did a fantastic job with the whole thing, I really also liked the scene where our perception of the world shifts with Jerry's and we see the horror he's really living. It was definitely unique to me and I liked that insight going forward for the rest of the movie. It also makes you question his perception of the fact that his kills were ""accidents"" - was that true or is that how he's able to justify himself? Great movie, I continually watch it, and I completely recommend it to everyone. So good!!",The Voices

I bought this movie at Best Buy out of pure curiosity. I did not expect the roller coaster of ideas this movie present us with. This film is a incredible comedic look at a ""psychopath"".Jerry(Ryan Reynolds) hears voices in his head and he sees them through his cat(Mr.Whiskers) and his dog(Bosco). Already getting pretty whacked. His dog is more of his moral compass through all the events taking place. His cat is more of his sadistic insane side that tried to get him to do bad things. I wouldn't want to spoil anything so as to not ruin the movie, so I won't continue. But, the performances in this movie are incredible. Anna Kendrick was wonderful as Lisa the awkward girl in Accounting. And Ryan Reynolds...Ryan Reynolds wasn't the same guy. He was this awkward guy in a shipping yard. Almost every interaction with him and someone was cringe worthy. This was not the guy from Drive. Although not the same movie, this film closely resembles American Psycho. though its humor was a little more evident and ""comedic"" for lack of a better term, than American Psycho. But the similarities are prevelent. This movie is a definite watch it to anyone that likes a little crazy in their films. 9/10",The Voices
168,b-connal,Schizophrenic and confused,6,22 March 2015,"A macabre left field comic horror which misses the mark either as a comedy or horror. A part homage to Norman Bates the film is as schizophrenic and as confused as its main character. Lacking the directional commitment to a clear vision the film is an entertaining curiosity rather than a future cult classic. The end credits further reinforce the point that the film wanted to be more brazen and more stylised but ultimately highlights only the uncertainty of the previous 104 minutes.Ryan Reynolds certainly carries the appearance of Norman Bates and in the past has shown his comedic nous but in The Voices never really convinces - whether this is due to the material, direction or lacklustre performance - you feel he is let down as the film never builds convincingly from a entertaining premise (which tires quickly).One small aside is the name of the town and the mention of Lucifer gives the movie a hint of Paradise Lost (i assume intentional) which makes the end credits more interesting and a very different meaning to the film.

169,jc74868,The Ending was a Total Let Down to a Very Entertaining Film,5,2 November 2016,"This is a difficult movie to either recommend, or totally pan. I gave it a chance on Hulu, and even though I'm not sure how to feel about it overall, it has stayed with me because of all its great moments. First of all, it's not for everyone. It is not a big budget blockbuster, and has a very unique, Indie, treatment in all respects. The Voices is very politically incorrect, and some may just not think the treatment of mental illness is funny at all. But, if you like quirky, different stories, and have an actual sense of humor, even for very ghastly subject matter, you'll love it...maybe you'll feel ripped off by the ending though. To me, it sorta had a low-budget production approach to ""American Psycho"" in a lower-middle class setting. Some aspects of The Voices gave me pause to reflect on some actual serial killers, Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy come to mind, and how they operated for years, right under many people's noses just because they were attractive, and/or just so unassuming. The lead character is just likable. Everything around him seems so peachy, lovely to the absurd, or is it really?The Voices has some very grim, dark, truly twisted moments. However, it does a very clever job at making you smile and even laugh out loud at the very next turn. While most of the movie left me more entertained than I've been in some time, the ending was a huge, baffling disappointment: it just seemed like they ran out of patience and said ""let's just end this thing a la a Simpson's Halloween skit"". Other's may think the ending was just as entertaining as the rest of the film...maybe if you just reeeally like Ryan Reynolds or other the characters, you'll be down with it. But, I think most reasonable people will just be like ""well, hmm...OK then, I guess"" I'd give it 7 stars for being a refreshingly unique, crazy, darkly comic Indie delight through most of its run...2 stars for the junk ending.",The Voices

Everything is very well handcrafted and directed, the actors are excellent, the pictures, the single scenes are professionally well made, the intention is intelligent, the movie makes you think about the these kind of sick or ill persons.But in the end I can not see any sense behind the way the movie was made and tries to put some message to the viewer. Shall we understand these persons and their intentions? Shall we take it as regular, normal. And shall we be entertained by a movie about this serious issue? I think no! I would like to read something about it; I would like to see a good documentary made about the subject, but not in this way, in the frame of a storytelling dark comedy. The issue is too serious for it. But the scene, when the girl comes in the house and sees how the shizophrenic really is living, thats excellent.All the way through the film I felt not comfortable looking at the theme, because in my opinion there is a big gap between the possible message of the film and the finalization as a intented dark comedy movie.On the other hand, as I said, the acting, the single scenes, the pictures (camera), the conversations they are really good. So I would give the director, the cameramen another chance to make an entertaining movie about another subject. Maybe a real comedy, horror film or thriller. But not something in between.

And even though his character is a complete psycho, you get a sense of how he is not the one controlling his urges, and you get some sympathy for the guy.

There are many ways this film stands out from the rest, from its story to its direction, to its, well, everything before it.

181,street_trash,The Voices (2014),8,2 June 2016,"(Perhaps mild spoilers)The Voices, directed by Marjane Satrapi, presents itself from the very beginning as a zany film with a questionable over the top opening sequence and carries on with an incredibly pitch black sense of humour. Initially, a film revolving around a man and his pets sounds harmless enough - however, surprisingly, this has a very interesting and unique take on mental illness and the troubling events that can happen if a sickness goes untreated.Ryan Reynolds stars as Jerry, a pleasant and mild-mannered factory worker living in America. Living in an apartment above an abandoned bowling alley with his cat Mr Whiskers and his dog Bosco, the audience is shown pretty quickly that Jerry seemingly appears normal enough on the surface, however when he finds himself alone at home, things get a little strange. You see, Jerry talks to his pets - which is something many of us can relate to - although I'm willing to bet that your pets never speak back. Jerry's pets do, and they often encourage him to give in to his darker instincts and do bad things to people. Think of it as a good conscience vs bad conscience - or in this case good dog vs evil cat. Jerry is conflicted as he doesn't want to do anything bad, yet it seems these things will tend to happen around him no matter what he does and how good of a person he tries to be.If this wasn't already triggering alarm sounds, the viewer is shown quite early on that Jerry sees a psychiatrist and how he dances around her questions by not being able to give honest answers - especially when she asks if he hears ""voices"". Also the struggles of whether or not he should take his medication for his illness shows the dire consequences of what could happen when someone that recognises they're unlike other people chooses to keep their problems a secret, or run away from them. Jerry often confides in his pets about his constant struggles and it's clear he is frightened of being overwhelmingly alone if he takes his medication. Ultimately it's the fear of losing the voices and comforting fantasy that makes him resist taking them.Reynolds has obviously starred in many films over the course of his career, but his performance of Jerry seems to be a very strange, but unique challenge. It seems that no matter how far gone inside his own mind Jerry has vanished, the audience is still able to feel sympathetic and caring, regardless of what wrongs he may be doing. Not only does Reynolds play as Jerry, but he also portrays the voices of several other characters, all of whom he must interact with during various parts of the film. Along for the ride, Gemma Arterton and Anna Kendrick star as Jerry's brief love interests during the film and although Kendrick is the more memorable and humble character, Arterton delivers more laughs. Jackie Weaver also stars as Jerry's psychiatrist, however it's unfortunate that her character is underused and wasted until well into the final act of the film.The Voices switches from incredibly dark scenes of dealing with untreated schizophrenia to amusing moments featuring a foul mouthed Scottish talking cat in a matter of seconds and admittedly it is quite difficult to keep up with at times. Although the film starts off with a more wacky and comical start, it's around the halfway point where the story begins to change and the audience is able to see the vast contrast between Jerry's perspective on his life and the way everyone else can see the world. There's one sequence that springs to mind immediately that shows just how delusional Jerry has become over time and it's a truly shocking scene that actually alters the entire tone of the film. There's also some traumatic childhood memories that perhaps drag on longer than was necessary, as it comes across as a rather forced way to try and explain Jerry's actions further.Despite the struggle to balance an even and consistent tone, The Voices still remains to be quite the mind trip. In a horror film aspect the violence and gore is kept at a minimal or off screen and the truly scary parts of this are more focused on delving inside the mind of a deranged individual. Reynolds did a tremendous job with the various roles and being able to juggle such a deeply disturbed yet sympathetic character shows real talent. I say this a lot, but this film definitely (and this time I mean definitely) will not be for everyone - but if you're willing to open your mind to something a bit different, maybe it'll be worth the worth. Also, again - it features a tabby cat with a Scottish accent and a vulgar mouth.",The Voices

185,cfish-4,An empathetic story about schizophrenia,8,6 February 2015,"Of all the psych thrillers I watch, this movie is the most empathetic look. It tells us how far we have come to demystify mental illness. The protagonist Jerry is schizophrenic and hallucinating, but as least he's not a paranoid (e.g. twelve monkeys) And he's actually somewhat aware that he hallucinates. And we see the story through Jerry's narrative. We could see why he didn't want to take his medications. We learned about the traumatic events that brought Jerry the conclusion that he must kill. We learn about his version of love. The story takes the audience through an empathetic journal within his mind. The darkness of the mind often bring out sick sense of humor as a coping mechanism. Comedians are some of the darkest people out there. I don't think I laughed much watching this movie, but I feel the sadness of understanding Jerry's hopeless being. I have to agree with other reviewers that the trailer could be misleading because it doesn't give an inkling about how dark the story is. But I think it's a good story nonetheless. It explains how the mentally ill could see and understand the world different from the healthy. Death, for example, is understood very differently from Jerry's perspective. To him, death means love. We could how he came to this conclusion from his trauma. Some reviewers balk at the poor logic - to me, they are the lucky people who have never experienced serious mental illness. Good for them. To those other people with more openness and empathy, I hope the story tells them that the logical thing to do depends on the context of one's understanding of the world. It's a sad story of hopelessness, but in a way, also makes me feel empathy, love and warmth for the protagonist.",The Voices

189,steve-mason66,Thoroughly enjoyable,7,10 February 2015,"I thought this movie was very good. I have never been a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds, but here he plays the part perfectly, Jerry is a confused guy who hears voices if he doesn't take his medication, notably from his dog and cat, who at times tell him conflicting things which confuses him even more. At heart Jerry is a likable, good guy working hard in the packing department, and tries desperately to join in and be liked by his fellow workers. His first victim was an accident, but spurred on by his cat, he kills again, all the time knowing it is wrong but can not seem to ignore the cat. He keeps the severed heads of his victims in the fridge, and like the cat and dog, they talk to him. When he doesn't take his medication we see the reality of things, his home is a mess piled high with rubbish and boxes with blood stains everywhere. So there are essentially two worlds, the world as he sees it without medication, and the one when he is medicated. He knows that taking his meds will help him by blocking out the voices, on the other hand he likes to talk to the cat, dog and severed heads, so he is torn between the two worlds. Yes he wants to get better, but he also knows that doing so he would lose the company of his pets (and the heads) Ryan plays this part very well and we can see the struggle he has with himself. We also learn that his mother suffered the same condition, and there are flashback moments with his mother as well as his childhood, which has bad memories for him. It is a very good movie, and you really feel for jerry. The only thing that spoilt it for me was the end credits, it went from being a dark comedy to a happy jolly dance number in, I presume heaven.

194,perkolatorproductions,He Wouldn't Hurt a Fly... (Quick Review and Film Theory),9,29 September 2015,"In short, if you enjoy dark comedies, catchy original music and fantastic comedic and dramatic performances from just about everyone involved, chiefly the surprisingly spectacular Reynolds, Kendrick and Arterton, watch the movie first and come back for my brief film fan theory/explanation. The only complaint I have are my personal feelings for the ending sequence which was still quite good in its own right.If you've already seen it, a (SPOILER) filled discussion will proceed now. Starting with my reason for disliking the ambiguous ending. It's basically because I still kind of hoped he'd make it and get closure. Or just be hospitalized because Jerry still seemed to be a good person at heart who went through major mental trauma and sincerely needed help.Furthermore, for those who didn't get the references both in the film itself as well as the title of this review, this movie has more than a few similarities to the 1960 Hitchcock classic, Psycho. From the way that Reynold's ""Jerry"" is traumatized by his mother's death/assisted suicide, to his inheritance of his victim's personalities through multiple personality disorder, to his habit of keeping the deceased around for creepy midnight chats, Norman and Jerry could be the proverbial twins from hell. Or could their relationship go even further? My understanding of the film is that The Voices is a spiritual successor, expanded origin to and continuation of the story of Norman Bates, the mad, maniacal, murderous manager of the Bates Motel. Not only do characters in The Voices make several direct references to the film, such as Ella Smith's Alison karaoke rapping about Norman Bates and Jerry's step-dad straight up calling him a psycho when he says he wishes Jerry and his mother were never born. But just watch Ryan Reynold's and Anthony Perkins' performances side by side, both their appearances and mannerisms are eerily nigh on indistinguishable.My speculation of how this might have come to pass starts after Norman was apprehended by the police at the end of Psycho. He was arrested during a time when insane asylums for insanity pleas, which Bates certainly would've taken, in legal trials were still very prevalent. So, all he'd have to do was escape the asylum or take his pills to be out on good behavior, like a ""good boy"" which Jerry's favorite hallucination, his dog and Norman's mother both say many times.Then he simply relocates to a quiet town, like Milton, and just tries to fit in hold back the urge to return to his schizophrenic, psychotic patterns. However, once Jerry/Norman performs his first comeback killing, albeit on accident, the brighter side of his split conscience (Rosco) begins to lose against the darker side (Mr. Whiskers). After he's forced to put Anna, the one girl he ever really loved, out of her misery, Rosco abandons him, leaving only Mr. Whiskers behind, then Jerry's empathetic emotional connection to those around him finally snaps entirely and he starts acting like a straight up psycho again.Anyways, I'm not going to be sleeping much tonight after coming to an understanding that I've watched way too many horror movies in my lifetime haha. I hope you've all enjoyed, or at least been interested by my input, sleep tight and don't let the bed flies bite haha, peace!",The Voices

197,fixxinet,Why Jerry was unable to control the voices ?,10,5 June 2015,"First off, this is one of the cleverest comedies in years from Hollywood, considering the moronicanization of the comedy genre. But it takes thoughtful people to appreciate it and those limited in time and development will not be able to.Of course the film is a genre mix with crime but lets focus here a little on the primary character : Jerry. As only a hobbyist psychologist I am certainly unaware of the actual number of people in real life that have reached the state that Jerry had in this movie. I.e someone who is actively losing the ability to maintain a balance between his dark and light worlds ( depicted in the movie via the dog and cat voices ) and ends up killing his co- workers. I do follow European and US news channels ( although I don't read the crime sections ) and can say that certainly a real-life crime event like that would be a breaking-news candidate at most mainstream media. What better than a real-life tragedy to keep their viewer or reader based occupied from what really concerns and makes actual difference? But I can't remember any stories like that. All there is on today is : Next elections, ongoing war in pretty much the whole of Asia; the stupid and moronic Russua-US cold war rhetoric and of course every single update on what Fortune 500 + corporations have been coming up with, things like self driving cars, drones, new curvy smart phones, smart watches, and what not.But the Jerry character. The guy ended up in a very very dark state, overwhelmed by his ""cat"" voice, lost grasp of good and bad. He was a clinical case of confusion. How far his case is from most of ordinary people in today's life on Earth ? Is he different than you ? Absolutely !. Most people's reasoning is complex enough to calculate that killing a second person you work with is pretty much a certain police detention ( if lucky to survive the detention ) and then immediately followed by state execution or life jail sentence . ( Of course the first killing was a crime on its own, but it was less severe because more or less it was an incident )So Jerry was too stupid to be able to find a solution in his life even though one was being presented to him in the face of the blonde office girl that liked him. Their romance was a typical social situation not unlike ones we are experiencing on a daily basis at work, at the pub, etc. Many people are facing such seemingly ordinary social situations each of which interconnects into our brain and combines with our current and past experiences, over and over, time after time, state after state. In Jerry's case he had reached a state which he was unable to process. And that was not such a hard state to solve, yet one which requires a healthy and moral early educational system in society.Jerry was also confused about what was the best thing to do. He had lost the ability to differentiate between good and bad, between dark and light. How do you know whether you are walking the light or dark path ? Perhaps you walk the light path while acutely aware of the Dark force with ability to defend against it.. almost like a Jedi Knight. Or perhaps you are like the cat. Rationally aware of your psychopathic personality but clever enough to keep you safe from getting as stupid as Jerry?

198,crazycar-539-616417,disgusting,1,14 April 2015,My rating of 1 is one too many. wouldve rated 0 if i could. This movie isn't funny-its gross. there's no humor whatsoever. there's only blood-lots of it. i find it hard to imagine anyone taking any sort of enjoyment from this movie. utter waste of my time-the movie makers should be sued! The acting is quite good while the cast is good quite good. Jemma Arterton is always something to look forward to.

It's a great movie to start with if you want to try to watch darker comedies. Before watching John Waters or movies like Man Bites Dog, it's a great start with this movie. Majority of today's audience might find this bull crap, casting Anna Kendrick and Ryan Reynolds which have created a big name in Hollywood but it's great to try and experiment in these kinds of movies.

200,movie-op,Darkly hilarious,9,29 November 2014,"Everyone's favorite director/graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi worked from someone else's material for the first time in The Voices, a dark, weirdly funny story that will appeal to those who enjoyed 2012's genre-bending Cabin in the Woods. Ryan Reynolds stars as Jerry, a sweet but troubled man who has conversations with his cat Mr. Whiskers, his dog Bosco, and the human heads he keeps stored in the fridge. Much credit has to go to screenwriter Michael R. Perry, who manages to make Jerry likable despite his homicidal streak. With much of the story being filtered through Jerry's skewed perception, Satrapi is able to play with the visuals, jumping between what Jerry sees and the reality of his situation to hilarious effect. This is an empathetic film, but first and foremost it's insanely funny. My major take-away from it: never trust Mr. Whiskers.",The Voices

If you just pick one scene from the film, where he were supposed to go on a date with this English girl, but she stood him over for a karaoke night. And on his way home she appears and he ""accidently"" kill her. That was so funny to watch, i would definitely watch it over again. Actually I think I will find it even funnier if i watch it again.

It's definitely not an awful movie. It's actually a very good movie with a very good plot. I was just expecting one thing and got something completely different. This was shelved as a COMEDY at our local video store. Having never seen a dark comedy before, I decided to try it out. Emphasis on the DARK comedy. I'll admit, there were a few funny elements such as the characterizations of Bosco and Mr. Whiskers, and some morbidly funny lines, but nothing else. It's DARK. Dark, dark, dark. The whole thing running through my mind the whole time after he killed Fiona, was that all the blood and gore was still there. There is blood all over his fridge. He is probably eating her body parts. He didn't even try to clean up. For me, that outweighed the ""funny"". I was more horrified than anything after the first hour. (Side note -- how did he not get all of his clothes just completely covered in blood with all the walls in his ""house"" that he leans on that have nasty all over them?)How was Jerry not thrown in a psych ward for life after he killed his mother? And how bad is his psychiatrist? I mean really. ""It's not like you killed anybody!"" ""Uh...it's like that...times three..."" ""What do you mean, Jerry?"" Seriously? What do you mean, Jerry? What do you think? ""Do you have packing tape?"" ""What? Why?"" WHY DO YOU THINK. I feel like it would've been a way better ending if Jerry just died in the fire instead of whatever the hell happened in the credits. I usually hate Ryan Reynolds, but I admit he does crazy well. Almost way too well. I also thought that this was a definitely way shocking roll for Anna Kendrick. She's usually a bit happier.",The Voices

Definitely not a lighthearted, true ""comedy,"" if that's what you're looking for. It gets very (very, very) dark but is incredibly fascinating and believable in its portrayal of the ill mind and distorted perspective of a very troubled man. The writing, acting, directing, production, and cinematography are 👌🏾👌🏾 all superb. And this is quite possibly Reynolds' best performance (or at least of what I've seen of him) yet -- Oscar-worthy.

Not only does Reynolds put on an amazing and at times heartbreaking performance, but he's also frickin hilarious. Most dark comedies only get one of the parts right, dark or comedy. But ""The Voices"" felt that it had managed to blend the two perfectly. And it knew when it was appropriate to be funny and when it needed to take itself seriously. The dialogue is both hilariously and realisitically awkward and as someone who has mental health issues (although not to the extent of Reynolds' character) I can honestly say that this movie represented the struggles of therapy, taking your medicine, and balancing the voices in your head perfectly.

The premise of the film would have made a great film with some really dark humour, which they missed by miles. The dark humour is absent and the film struggles to understand what it's meant to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a poignant observation of mental illness? It's not even an aimless ramble of a film. It feels like it's trying to go somewhere... and doesn't. None of the characters were likable, even Ryan Reynold's character so it was hard to care what was going to happen next.

223,Desmond-Barber,Entertaining dark comedy that missed it's opportunity for greatness,7,7 February 2015,"This is one of those movies that touts itself as a comedy to capture the audience members, but provides something more dark than anyone could anticipate. The movie is setup to lead the viewer into thinking that Jerry, Ryan Reynolds, is a mentally challenged man trying to fit into his mundane job as a factory worker. Jerry is awkward around his coworkers and he has an affection toward one female coworker, Fiona. Naturally, Fiona is hesitant to embrace Jerry's advances; however she finds herself in situation where Jerry ""comes to the rescue"". As he's transporting her home, they get into a car accident hitting a deer and the movie clumsily presents the depths of Jerry's psychosis; having the deer beg Jerry to kill him. Naturally Jerry obliges and Fiona realizes all of her fears and predictably runs away into the woods.You've seen the rest of the movie in other forms after this point; Jerry murders her, draws in another coworker, murders her and murders a third coworker, all in the span of 3-4 days. Jerry confesses to his psychiatrist and the movie basically ends in a predictable manner.The movie reminded me a lot of the novel, ""American Psycho"", in which the main character presents himself as a normal person with a severely psychotic dark side.This movie could have easily been called ""Jerry"" as it's more about Jerry's interaction with reality and what he desires to see. The movie presents the environment from Jerry's perspective, but would have been better served to show you Jerry's psychosis in his blood- stained apartment above an abandoned bowling alley.",The Voices

I can see that it would be useful in helping people understand mental illness, especially schizophrenia, but it just manages to take the joke too far making everything just look ridiculous. I didn't think there was much depth to Reynold's character, he was seemingly shallow, a bit idiotic, and just left me feeling like I didn't understand him. His actions seemed random, ridiculous and without reason. It was obvious that he was torn between listening to his cat or his dog, but their influence on him wasn't really clear. The closing credits confirmed my feeling of dissatisfaction with the terrible song the cast sang. Although light-hearted and made with good intentions, I feel that it was making light of mental illness, and that all you have to do when you're feeling down is to 'sing a happy song', which just seemed completely ridiculous to me.",The Voices

""Genre-bending"" is the polite term employed by publicists, but a less politic word for the film is ""mess."" Frantic stylistic shifts between black-comic whimsy (chatty pets and equally voluble severed heads) and gruesome drama doom this curio, which stars Ryan Reynolds as Jerry, a bathtub-factory worker who at first seems merely a little slow but is gradually revealed to be deeply disturbed. The girls in the office (Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick) seem mildly dismissive but also harbor some affection for Jerry, and though the former stands him up for a date (Jerry's idea of a good time is a Chinese restaurant where an Elvis impersonator does a floor show), after a few drinks she agrees to take a fateful ride with him.Screenwriter Michael R. Perry is one of those unfortunate scribes who thinks one brilliant idea is enough to sustain a movie. The idea is this: Jerry talks to his pets, and they talk back. Mr. Whiskers, the cat, is a foul-mouthed psycho who, in a Scottish brogue, encourages Jerry to become a serial killer, while Bosco, the kind-hearted dog with a dopey Southern accent, tries to steer Jerry into being like him — a ""good boy."" It's a great joke and the early going amounts to a hilarious SNL sketch, but then both Perry and Satrapi flounder for what to do next as the levity disappears for long stretches and sickeningly staged mayhem takes its place.It wouldn't be accurate to call the film a horror comedy because so many scenes are played less like terror-fantasy and more like ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer."" Meanwhile, the plot gets stuck in idle as we wait for the citizenry to get wise to Jerry's string of slayings.

228,Unluckymagpie,An underrated film with a strong performance from Reynolds.,8,6 December 2015,"A truly underrated film. It has a brilliant performance from Ryan Reynolds, in a role that is pretty unusual for him, and allows him to get out of his typical action stereotype, as he really is a great comedic and dramatic actor, when paired with the right script. A curiously sinister yet funny tone that simultaneously makes you want to laugh and throw up, the film is a dark comedy- with emphasis on the DARK- and may not be suited to everyone's tastes, admittedly. It has moments where the gore can be quite, well, gory, and certainly it touches on mental illness in a way that may make some people uncomfortable. However, in my view, the film never makes fun of Jerry, our protagonist. In Reynolds' words, he is ""a serial killer with a heart of gold"", and he still remains a likable character that you root for, even to the end. The film beholds beautiful visuals with great use of colours and very creative ways of showing how Jerry's mind works. I honestly loved it, and recommend it!",The Voices
229,ross-denton,"Challenging film, but just NOT a comedy",8,26 July 2015,"* I guess SPOILER ALERT*I watched this film on a plane where it came categorised as a comedy. I am really at a loss to see how this film could amuse. It amuses in the same way that a Lynch movie amuses: somebody says something incongruent while twisting a knife, or severing an ear. Yes, the more shallow reviewers might see something amusing in the fact that the cat and dog talk to each other in accents. But they are just representations of a homicidal split personality. Yes, there are talking severed heads. But all of this has to be set against (IMHO) a very accurate portrayal of the most severe mental illness. I really didn't know where this was going, but always assumed that there could be no Hollywood happy ending, because Jerry said he wanted to be good, but the foul-mouthed Begbie-esque cat just wouldn't let him. The movie came sharply into focus momentarily when the drugs kicked in, and he saw, clearly (although ironically woozily) what he had done.He tried for happiness with the Kendrick character, but you always knew that without any external support (or possibly drugs) the cat was always going to win. It was again ironic that the characters bonded over a cat, just the wrong one. You always knew that she was going to go to his house, and that nothing good could come of that. But that part wasn't sappy, just inevitable. Loved up people want to be together.The acting was great. Those criticising Reynolds are not seeing the tightrope he walks: Pee Wee Herman likability, but with an even blacker background. Kendrick was good, likable and doomed. Arterton, I assume, was meant to be a cypher: what set him off. Her Dick van Dyke English must have been intended to show vain shallowness, and possibly, but only possibly, deserving of her fate. Weaver was a box ticker that didn't understand what was across the desk from her, and her terror looked quite genuine to me.Not sure about the heaven coda scene. I view it as brushing my teeth after vomiting, it was intended just to take the bad taste away.I'd be interested to hear from clinicians that might understand whether this was an accurate portrayal of the disorder. My guess was that it was.So why call it a comedy? How else do you sell an unremittingly bleak story of mental illness featuring three A-listers?",The Voices
230,The-Meattie_GoesToMooTown,Really Bad Movie,2,28 January 2014,"The movie was bad. It was a highly visual film, but with unlikeable characters, and there was basically no plot other than a guy who's nuts and starts killing people. None of the dialog was particularly clever, and the ""talking pets"" angle was sorely underused (a missed opportunity) - most of the people in the theater laughed when the extent of the pet's humor was that the cat says the ""f"" word every so often in a Scottish accent.There was no mystery, suspense or even emotion at any point in the film. No fear of if this guy would get caught, and no involvement in his emotional plight. It all came off like a dull hipster romp, and the people who are praising it are likely just that (hipsters) Add to that that the movie was way too dark, very off-putting even for a dark comedy (there were no laughs, and no scares) a film that doesn't know what it wants to be except that there is a song and dance sequence at the end where all the dead characters sing around and make the audience go home upbeat... the movie tried way too hard and fell flat on it's face. If you're going to see it because of the talking pet angle, it's like 20 minutes of the film. And then Reynolds starts putting people's heads in the fridge and they talk to him, but they really have nothing interesting to say! Performances were fine, but I seriously gave it 2/10 for it's terrible pacing, barely non-existent storytelling and then not succeeding in any of it's genre attempts - be it comedy or horror or psychological character study.

235,kawaters,One of Ryan Reynolds' best performances!,9,9 February 2015,"The Voices may be one of Ryan Reynolds' best performances. As a huge Reynolds' fan, my thoughts when watching this film were that, in contrast to every other film Ryan has made, this was a Ryan we had never seen before. I have never been unhappy with Ryan's work (except, maybe RIPD), but after watching The Voices, it seemed to me that all I had seen up till now was Ryan playing ""Berg"", basically. Ryan being the funny guy. Even in Super Hero films, Ryan was a comedian with a smart mouth. Yes, he also plays Ryan who is terrified, (Buried), but in this new movie, The Voices, you hardly recognize him. In fact, it is so rare, that on the handful of occasions where Ryan would make a facial expression or use a tone of voice that was familiar, I found myself noting, ""Oh, there's a Ryan expression."" There is a shower scene and die-hard Reynolds' fans will probably find themselves hoping the camera will pan down to his chest (they don't), despite the fact that he is not in his usual ripped condition.I watched the movie twice in a row. I later watched it a third time. Unfortunately, unless you really like black humor, this movie is not something you will want to watch 6 or 7 times. Not because Ryan's performance is less than spectacular, but simply because the movie does not leave you feeling uplifted or warm and happy inside. The end of the film (when they roll the credits), conversely, is one of the best parts of the film. I liken it to Austin Powers. It is truly entertaining and I can't seem to stop rewinding and watching it again. It is a tremendously interesting film that definitely keeps your attention the entire time. I would highly recommend you do not watch the trailers' first. I know better, but never can seem to help myself. I watched the trailers and would definitely recommend that you do not.I would say it is a must-see for anyone at least once!",The Voices

237,richardc1039,a refreshing dark comedy that hits the nail on the head.,10,20 April 2015,"I started watching the voices with low expectations, bus was surprised by the well written, well acted and well shot movie. The story may seem a little absurd to some but as a person who has been close to a similar situation, it's all to real. A close family member was diagnosed with schizophrenia and this had tragic endings as he ended up killing his wife of 25 years, and he has since spoke of voices and demons, so anyone who can say this film is silly or unrealistic obviously has never dealt with such a situation. This movie brought back some very hard memories but also made me laugh out loud, which is quite hard to do with such dark and sensitive subject matter, so anyone who has been close to these sorts of situations will tell you you will either laugh or cry. I also liked the way that Ryan Reynolds character was likable, portrayed as an ill person instead of a bad person. The animal characters also added a nice twist as opposed to just seeing a man spiral out of control in a room alone. If you want to watch a comedy horror, watch Shaun of the dead or idle hands,but if you want to watch a thought provoking,horrific tale, with plenty of laugh out loud moments, this could be for you.",The Voices
238,acetrainerbean,"A Well Acted, Dark Comedy, With Heart",8,22 March 2015,"When I first saw the trailer for the voices I knew I was going to enjoy this movie, but that it would not be for everyone. When I bought my tickets for the film I was expecting to watch a black comedy that would make me laugh out loud but what I did not expect was that the film would take me on a journey into the mind of the broken human psyche. I mean yes I knew the main character heard voices and was killing people but I did not expect to care for this character and empathize with him. The portrayal of the main character ""Jerry"" by Ryan Reynolds is fantastic as in one moment he can make us laugh out loud and in the next instant feel heartbroken about his tragic situation. The film takes on a ""look who's talking"" approach to the voices Jerry is hearing which leads to some hilarious scenes involving a cat, a dog, and a few severed heads. This may sound ridiculous to some but the direction of the film combined with the great acting never makes you feel like you are watching a gimmick or a cheap joke but rather that you, like Jerry are falling further and further into insanity. Although Ryan Reynolds portrayal of Jerry is both funny and harrowing he is not the only character who you will leave the movie thinking about. Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick, and especially Jacki weaver all play their part perfectly.In summation The Voices is a film that will make you burst with laughter, then well up with tears (If you are like my mother) and finally laugh again. I gave this film a 8 out of 10 because it is a film I would not want to watch again, but it is a movie I am glad I saw and one which I will remember in the years to come. Thank you for reading this review it was my first ever review and I apologize in advance if the grammar is off. Have a great day.",The Voices
239,dark-angel-kiss,Fantastic,10,12 April 2015,"I would never have thought this movie to be both so colorful and funny as it is dark and gruesome. Especially the contrast to what is real and what is in his head is beautifully portrayed with not only said colors, but also with imagery that makes you almost feel as if not taking his pills would indeed be the better option for him.It's a slippery slope Ryan's character is heading off, but it never bores to watch his steps going into the wrong direction. Honestly I only watched the movie because the description of a talking cat making him want to murder someone was something that made me laugh. I did not once regret it, would recommend it to anyone.",The Voices
240,SachZmith75,Oh Ryan Reynolds,8,26 April 2015,"Overall I was actually pleased with this film. I hadn't hear much about it prior to seeing it in the video store but it looked kind of interesting. My impression of Ryan Reynolds is that he likes to make a fool out of himself, after all he is playing Deadpool. His acting always seems over the top and has a certain happy go lucky tone to it. his type of acting is why I actually enjoyed this film as a whole. It was almost as if Ryan Reynolds knew this role would fit him so well. A legit crazy mofo with a happy go lucky view of life (that is until he's hit with a dose of life.) I'm used to feeling like Ryan Reynolds takes full control of movies, like he needs to be in the spotlight. In this case is totally payed off for him. My 8 out of 10 rating was based off of the great portrayal of camera angles and unique dialogue. I am a sucker for giving two sides of a story. I love good camera magic.",The Voices

Could be a career crater. Doubt he'd pass Acting 101 with that performance.I don't feel as strongly about Gemma Arterton's and Anna Kendrick's work here.Plot - Dumb and Dumberer is sophisticated and fluid in comparison.

It is definitely not for everyone, the tone is reminiscent of American Psycho and so incredibly dark but also quite humorous. Ryan Reynolds gave an absolutely incredible performance as this troubled man suffering from schizophrenia. I was interested throughout the entire film and totally invested in the characters. It was just long enough and the pacing was really great. This movie has gotten no attention I think because of the very specific genre that it's in. It's a comedy/horror and not everyones cup of tea. Be prepared for some gore and language. This is definitely going to be added to my movie shelf very soon!",The Voices
243,becca_mans,Interesting,8,6 September 2015,"Jerry hears voices. These voices come from his cat and dog, and then later on in the movie, the heads of his victims who he keeps in his fridge. But he's not evil. He's just a sweet guy who is very ill and finds himself in some unfortunate situations. Ryan Renolds did a fantastic portrayal of a mentally ill person who hears voices, it was very well done and didn't belittle or insult schizophrenic people because the majority of the movie is from Jerry's (Ryan Renolds) point of view and it gives the viewer a great understanding of the situation. (however I am not schizophrenic myself and not in the right position to judge whether or not this movie was offensive.)",The Voices

245,Sluggy4000,Better than I expected.,7,21 November 2015,"Ryan Reynolds plays Jerry, an awkward but overly upbeat factory worker who talks to his pet dog and cat. The story follows his first ""accidental"" killing and his struggles with trying to never do it again, his dog acting as his conscience and his cat acting as his murderous urges. When this movie started I admit that I was a bit let down. The movie has a rather poor beginning not really hitting it's stride until about the twenty minute mark. But after that the comedy picks up, and not only that but it actually takes itself more seriously then I thought it would. This by no means is a negative thing however as it doesn't dampen the comedy by doing this, only enhancing it actually. I was surprised by how compelling of a story they managed to tell in this film despite the absurd concept. I never had an truly uncontrollable belly laughs while watching this movie but I did laugh more than I do at most ""comedy"" movies I see nowadays. Something about hearing the dog talk in the dumb voice we all give dogs always managed to make the little jokes that much funnier. Lines such as ""Oh Jerry, you're a good boy. Nobody's gonna rape you"" delivered in a dopey dog voice managed to get convince me that my early doubts were unfounded. The few negatives of this movie was that most of minor actors were bad enough to truly detract from the overall effect of the movie. One of them in particular is what left such a negative taste in my mouth at the beginning of the film. I also thought that the ending went on just 5 minutes too long. It hit this perfect ending spot, bringing closure to the story arc of Jerry and wrapping up the movie with a few questions for you to ponder. Then the movie keeps going and wipes away its well done ending with a literal song and dance number. The Voices was a surprisingly serious comedy that managed to really entertain me and I would heartily recommend it to those who don't mind a bit of gore. 7.5/10",The Voices
246,caligamy,Not so sure about the comedy part but..,9,5 March 2016,"This movie came up on shuffle in Hulu and I thought.. ""a comedy? OK.. never heard of this movie."" Few minutes into it I was getting bored and something about the cleanness of everything seemed really off and I was completely missing the humor part. And then.. things got crazy, literally. An accidental(?) stabbing here, beheading there, arguments with the cat and dog.. and suddenly I couldn't stop watching it. *SPOILER* Once I realized this movie was from the point of view of a schizophrenic serial killer with occasional glimpses of what the reality he was actually in were, it was a pretty damn good watch. This movie made me feel confused whether to feel afraid of Ryan's character, sad for him, laugh at him, or root for his victims.This was very entertaining once everything began to unfold. Slow beginning, gripping middle, and a strange, weird ending.",The Voices
247,evanalexx,Bosco is Evil,10,23 March 2016,"This movie was brilliant in my opinion. I thought the dog was a voice of reason at first, but honestly I believe he's evil. He deluded Jerry into thinking that he was a ""Good Boy"" throughout his rampage. He continuously put down the cat, even though the cat was telling Jerry what he really was. When somebody came to the door, Bosco got Jerry fired up saying ""I got your back"" and ""I'd take a bullet for you"" making him feel safe and not alone. When things hit the fan Bosco ran for it while the cat stayed with Jerry until the bitter end. Loved this insane nonsensical movie. All in all, this was a crazy movie that described mental illness in a funny yet dark manner.",The Voices
248,patriciahendrickson,"Ryan Reynolds personified the ""relatable serial killer""",10,28 April 2016,"I've read a bunch of reviews putting this film down. I have to say, palettes must be unseasoned. This IS a dark comedy if I've ever seen one. It was as funny as it could be, given the topic. Mr whiskers' sense of humor was simply Jerry's understanding of humor. Stemming from his deep down loathing of himself placed by his mother and father's actions. This is why Bosco's influence is less effective, it's a foreign attempt at self talk. ""You're a good boy jerry""Bosco also has the less serious of the two voices. Mr.whiskers has more substance because that's the opinionated emotion that's fed more. Of course it is. The only positive feedback he's ever gotten is from his psycho therapist. You'll see that when they interact in the movie. ""You're a good person jerry"" Bosco is a dog so it changes to ""good boy"" all of these self help mantras are replicated to him through a dog who's voice you just can't take seriously. This touches on how believable it is to Jerry that he actually has a chance at normalcy. A feeling that is confirmed when he's on his medication. His world is full of darkness and uncertainty when he's medicated, he doesn't trust himself to function with so much negativity surrounding himself. So, he does what many schizophrenic patients often do, he goes off the meds and lives in his fantasy. It's easier for Jerry to live in the lie.Back to the comedy... I saw it. Again, from a messed up perspective but it was there. From the butterflies floating around Jerry's head to the ""where's my fu@$ing food, f@ck face?!"" His awkwardness at the meeting for the company picnic..""what, are you running for office, Jerry?"" It's what I would refer to as ""insinuated humor"" it's what Jerry would find funny, as he hasn't been all that exposed to happiness or healthy humor in his childhood interactions. Most importantly, I felt it showed another side to schizophrenia. The side we don't often get. It wasn't simply ""explained"" you experienced it through Jerry's mental state. You saw it develop, the nuances in his condition. The drastic difference between how he saw reality and how others saw his reality. It was intensely different. So much was blocked from his mind, saran wrap stacks against the walls, the bloody lampshades and pools about the house. They were invisible to Jerry because those images didn't compliment his fantasy. That would be too much for him. He threw up the first time he really SAW what he did to Fiona. His psychosis is so bad that it's even able to mask smells. Jerry isn't a bad person, he holds a lot of remorse for his actions but at the same time, he IS broken beyond repair. He realizes that finally and allows himself to slip away. His final act being to spare the world of his ""accidents"" selfless as he knows how to be.All in all, I loved this movie and Ryan Reynolds portrayed this character with such great attention to detail. I forgot he was dead pool while watching this movie. I was lost in his grieving character, I believed he was Jerry. Kudos Ryan Reynolds,you're amazing.",The Voices

I thought Ryan would have some of his sly/clever lines that would make you laugh but that is not this kind of movie. It is dark, but he truly was great in this movie and acted phenomenally. There were times in the movie when it was a little boring but there was some suspense. I was hoping for some kind of twist but there was nothing.

252,uweumberath,This is the movie that made Ryan Reynolds one of my favorite actors,10,29 May 2018,"Ryan Reynolds is best known for playing the pretty boy in various Rom-Com-Movies. The good looking guy who falls in love with a good looking girl after going through a lot of trouble. Sometimes funny, sometimes romantic. But this movie gave him the chance to show a wider range of acting. Playing a psychopath is probably the most challenging role for an actor. But Reynolds did a great job in this movie playing a very strange character, that gets all your sympathy although doing terrible things. I've never felt more sympathy for a psychopath than in this movie. And his female victims (Gemma Arterton and Anna Kendick) make it even better. Very strange movie, but I love it!",The Voices

254,TheEvilBread,A Unique Oddity,8,23 February 2016,"Ryan Reynolds stars as Jerry, a man who has a rather upbeat and Technicolor view on the world, which is expressed solidly through the cinematography. He seems like the typical shy guy you meet who just needs to come out of his shell. However, things are a little morecomplicated than that. Jerry is severely mentally ill, we see him at a therapy session within the first moments of the film, and he admits that he has stopped taking his prescribed anti-psychotic medication for some time now. His Technicolor world is a result of not taking this medication and within it he has hallucinations of his dog, Bosco, and his cat, Mr. Whiskers talking to him in a very odd angel/devil on the shoulder scenario. Bosco represents Jerry's good morality whereas Mr. Whiskers taunts Jerry into becoming a serial killer and giving into his darker impulses, naturally with a Scottish accent. After an accident one night, Jerry ends up killing one of his co-workers and after some persuasion from his cat, he cuts up the body and proceeds to put the head in his refrigerator, right next to the eggs and milk. Of course, in typical film fashion, this begins to snowball and we're left with a disturbingly hilarious story arc as the body count begins to pile up and the missing persons begin to becoming more noticeable.That being said, the film does tackle some serious mental health awareness issues and becomes quite tragic in a sense as Jerry begins to struggle with his own inner demons and tries to convince himself that he's a good person, despite each aspect of his psyche trying to persuade him back and forth between morally correct and psychopath. Ryan Reynolds in the voices Ryan Reynolds is superb in this role; he has always been one of my favourite contemporary actors, not convinced? Go watch The Nines or Buried and it'll change your mind, he has a truly impressive acting range when provided with some worthwhile material and he possesses perfect comedic timing which is expressed thoroughly here. Norman Bates seems to have been a clear direction he was heading for, which is successfully achieved, boyishly charming yet with a clear sadistic side. However, what is particularly interesting is that Ryan Reynolds doesn't just play one character in The Voices, he plays three (four counting another very short voice-over role). The voices of Bosco and Mr. Whiskers are played by Reynolds with accompanying accents, a rather Southern sounding twang for the morally good Bosco and the aforementioned Scottish accent for the evil Mr. Whiskers, which as a Scotsman, I found to be perfectly fitting. Although it's clear as the film goes on that Reynolds is doing the voice over for these characters, you will be debating with yourself for the first initial moments because of how surreal it is to hear the same person playing three separate people in such short bursts within the same scene.Reynolds is not without great co-stars though, joined by Gemma Arterton as the main love interest, Fiona for the beginning of the film before spending the rest of her screen-time as a decapitated head and in numerous Tupperware boxes. Anna Kendrick plays Lisa, who becomes the focus of Jerry's attention as soon as Fiona is out of the picture and Jacki Weaver plays Dr. Warren, Jerry's psychologist and motherly figure in the few scenes she appears. Each co-cast member plays their roles solidly and within tone to the film when necessary, playing both comedic and fearful when required of them.Helming the film is Marjane Strapi who provides very impressing directing skills, spectacular even. The decision to show us both sides of Jerry's reality, the colourful world he experiences when he doesn't take his medication and the dank, sorrowful reality of real life when he's on them is something that truly makes you sympathise with the character, still jabbing with dark comedy but evoking genuine emotion from the audience. The inclusion of graphic violence is also a strong directorial choice, it's significantly more brutal and realistic than that of a typical horror film to the point where the colour contrasts of the violence compliment the vivid 'voices world' colours. Just everything about the film is balanced very impressively, very John Waters and Tim Burton. As stated before, the film is within a world of its own, extremely fascinating at times, we can sympathise with Jerry when he doesn't take his medication because it's then we escape the gloomy, depressing reality of what we know to be our world and escape into a much more vivid one filled with unpredictability and constant entertainment with each new aspect it pulls out from under us. Wouldn't we all choose that kind of world if we could? Except without the psychopathic tendencies, of course.The Voices is a very enjoyable experience and one that I believe I will visit a few more times in order to experience the surrealism and memorable trio of main characters. The cast and crew are a very important foundation for any film and they successfully executed what they aimed to achieve in this case through strong casting, acting and directing. Most importantly, if you have a dark sense of humour, it's going to be right up your street, the best blend of horror and dark comedy I've seen for quite a number of years. Reynolds and Strapi are unforgettable in their roles both in-front and behind the camera, a combo that I hope will team up again for the future.",The Voices

259,camilledabert,Heavily underrated movie,10,1 March 2019,"First thing I'd like to say is that this movie is telling nothing but the personal story of Jerry. Not the life of a serial killer, not the life of a crazy dude gone nuts, no, the story of Jerry's character. And this story isn't a horror movie, not a thriller, not a frucking comedy, it's a full on drama. This movie is SAD. There is NOTHING funny in this, nor is it scary. Unsettling and surprising, yes, but not scary (unless some fake blood is enough to make you tremble, then yes, it's scary). Jerry's character is wonderfully complex, his story, masterfully revealed, bit by bit, is compelling to no end and you genuinely want to love that boy. Like really, he needs some love. But while the writing of this movie is as good as it can be, this film really shines in its filming and acting. both are on point and flawless, serving the story perfectly and succeeding in making you see the world from Jerry's AND others' eyes at the same time which is definitely a performance. Beyond that there's also the few moments when the film really makes you question things like the benefits of the pills for the patient, judging people without knowing them, or that very intelligently worded subject of what makes us sane or insane in the last dialogue between Jerry and his doctor.
Now I won't go into details as it would take me months to rightfully describe everything good with that movie. What I will say however is that it IS a movie to put on your watchlist and PLEASE don't watch it as a comedy or a horror movie because it is neither. It's just the sad story of Jerry, that boy no one ever understood.A lot of people's reaction to this movie is ""wtf have I just watched"", probably mainly because they went in and watched having in mind the idea that this movie was going to scare them or make them laugh. Please don't make the mistake of expecting anything of the sort, and you won't be disappointed.",The Voices
