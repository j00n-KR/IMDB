0,SnoopyStyle,Mol beautiful but portrait limited,5,28 December 2015,"In 1955, Bettie Page (Gretchen Mol) is testifying before a Senate subcommittee on pornography. She's been a star pinup for the notorious underground bondage world. The movie flashes back to 1936 Nashville. She's abused as a teen by her father. Her marriage leads to more abuse. She get gang raped. She runs off to NYC. She tries pageants, modeling and acting. She starts posing for photographers and private groups entering into the world of risqué photography.The tone is slight when the material gives the movie an opportunity to be darker and more daring. Gretchen Mol has always been the beautiful girl who couldn't distinguish herself as a great actress. In that way, she is like Bettie. I wish her performance digs deeper into her personality. Everybody wants to see her naked. I want to see her soul. She is simply a pinup and not much more. The black and white photography is perfunctory. This should be deeper.",The Notorious Bettie Page
1,kosmasp,As real as it can be (for me),8,22 April 2007,"I watched this movie at the International Film Festival in Berlin. I didn't read anything about it or would I say that I knew much about Bettie Page (I knew her name and that she was a Pin-Up). From the title alone I was expecting a documentary about her life. The first few minutes made it clear, that it wasn't. So I thought it was an actual movie with Bettie Page starring in it ...But that wasn't the case either as I realised. Almost ten minutes into the film, I saw an actor that I knew from other films. Films that are recent productions. That is where it hit me. Oh yeah, it's biopic! The movie just got more interesting and I didn't mind, that I went in it, with a (somewhat) false expectation. I like to be surprised, when it comes to movies.Although I don't know Bettie Page as I've written before, I do think that Gretchen Mol did a superb job portraying her. The star and the director (of American Psycho fame) got in front of the crowd and answered questions. I didn't ask anything (I'm pretty sure Gretchen wouldn't have given me her number though), but one guest shot this ludicrous question, about why the movie was so bad (in other words emotionally detached, but that was the point she wanted to achieve, imo)! It did leave Mary Harron (director) speechless for a few seconds, which is normal, so the guy tried to apologize and said that he does like all her other work (too late buddy! ;o) ... and that's the end!",The Notorious Bettie Page
2,rmax304823,What a Nice Kid.,5,20 July 2010,"In the 1890s you couldn't show an ankle, now the internet is awash in explicit sexuality of the most diverse sort. Bettie Page came somewhere in between, like the 1950s, when brassieres were conical and foundation garments (that is, girdles) were the ne plus ultra of sensuality in magazines with titles like ""Tip and Toe"" and ""Black Stockings."" It's probably an interesting story of Bettie Page's rise to fame as a model in these schlock magazines and movies but you won't find it here.What you find here is a rather routine story of a not-so-young girl from Nashville, Tennessee, who isn't ashamed of her body, despite the calumny of her family and the Baptist church She's a kind of Candide among sharks. Good thing too. There are one or two scenes of Gretchen Moll naked, full frontal, and a couple of reenactments of her role in mild S/M movies that ought to turn on the preverts among us and every British man on earth.I don't know why I should bother outlining the story. You could probably write it yourself between snoozes. Bettie, you'll be surprise to find out, relishes the prospect of giving pleasure to others, as long as it preserves her virtue. In fact there is a nicely done scene of Bettie being unwittingly lured into a gang bang as a youth, probably fabricated. Oh, and there's also a suggestion of sexual abuse. Ho hum.Sadly, once she gets into the major leagues, her managers push the envelope too far and she gets into trouble. And all because she's a Rousseauian savage.This is an HBO production. They've come up with some fine, challenging stuff -- Citizen X and others -- but this isn't one of them.I have a poster of Bettie Page on the wall of my hallway. She's not particularly attractive. I'll tell you why it's there. I have a preverted brother who was fond of her. And I have a young lady chat friend who is an Argentinian midget who asked if I knew anything about her. Queries from two such sources were impossible to forget, so I ordered a poster. Haven't looked at it in years.",The Notorious Bettie Page
3,BA_Harrison,A film about Bettie Page: bound to be fun.,8,8 June 2008,"I've no idea whether the real Bettie Page50s 'cheescake' and fetish modelwas as genuinely sweet a gal as she is portrayed in this film by the delightful Gretchen Mol, but there's no denying that this biopic is a fun, entertaining and saucy account of the rise to fame of a cult sex icon.With scenes shot in both black & white and glorious Technicolour, The Notorious Bettie Page perfectly captures an era in which the sexual revolution was in the very early planning stages, and the moral do-gooders in power were still out to protect the public from perversion in all of its many forms.Writer/director Mary Harron's script follows a pretty standard biopic format, beginning by charting the trials and tribulations faced by the young god-fearing Southern gal in her home town (including molestation by her father and an abusive husband), and then follows her career as she moves to New York to become the number one pin-up model of the decade.Harron, perhaps rather naively, depicts her subject as a wide-eyed innocent, always blissfully unaware that what she is doing is considered sinful by many, and, whilst this approach is questionable, Mol's performance is so engaging that it's easy to forgive any possible factual inaccuracies (of course, with the film's star frequently naked or clad in very sexy lingerie, I'm willing to overlook quite a lot!). The film also features a very likable supporting cast, including Lili Taylor, Chris Bauer and Jared Harris.These days (where almost any perversion conceivable is available on the internet), Bettie Page's work is considered by most to be pretty tame stuff, seeming almost quaint and rather charming. However, I can't help but wonder what might have become of Bettie had she embarked on her 'modelling' career in the more extreme climes of the 21st century...",The Notorious Bettie Page
4,moonspinner55,Fill-in-the-blanks biography of the pin-up queen...only occasionally gives us a true sense of time and place,5,16 July 2010,"Gretchen Mol's impeccable casting as the winking, ticklish nudie-cutie Bettie Page could not have been a better choice, but that was the film's biggest inspiration and nothing else here quite measures up. A naïve gal from Tennessee, church-going and raised by a strict mother, hits New York City in 1949 after walking out on her marriage to an abusive soldier. Bettie wins a few modest beauty contests before stepping into her future role as a pin-up model for men's entertainment magazines; with times and tastes quickly changing however, the era of the cheesecake photo passes and Bettie smoothly segues into a harder type of pornography: bondage photos and light S&M shorts. Nothing in this girl's life appears to happen according to a plan...it's all serendipitous. Bettie is asked, ""You wanna try this?"" or ""Can you do something like this?"", and her answer is always, ""Sure, why not!"" To her it was all fun and games, accompanied by a big country smile and an innocent shrug. When her steady fellow points out to her how disreputable her S&M photos are, her answer is to fly off to Miami Beach, where she picks up a muscle-boy and dances under the stars. Are we to assume Bettie was not so sweet and innocent, that she knew exactly what she was doing? A flashback to Page's childhood suggests a certain looseness already forming (also a hint of sexual abuse by a man who appears to be her father). The subplot about a formal investigation into smut-peddlers is a squashy mess, and the black-and-white cinematography is mostly disappointing. Still, Gretchen Mol is something else entirely; creating a genuine character out of this noodle-headed script shows true talent, and she matches up with our memories of the legendary Bettie Page quite nicely. We never feel anything for this Bettie, we're never moved by her sordid ups-and-downs, though that's due to the handling. Mol rises above the sloppy material and gives it more than just a nostalgic kick. She's in the spirit, even if the rest of the picture could certainly use some soul. ** from ****",The Notorious Bettie Page
5,Quinoa1984,"not too surprising it's an HBO film, but a good one nonetheless, with a terrific lead in Moll",7,30 April 2006,"I had a vague idea of who Bettie Page was, partly due to her appearance in the very wee days of Playboy (apparently, when she got her photo taken of her and her Santa hat, just that, she didn't know what the mag was). The movie, co-written and directed by American Psycho's Mary Harron, fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough. A southern belle of a church goer has some bad experiences and leaves them behind to seek better times in New York City, where she gets into modeling, and from there a lot more. Soon, she becomes the underground pin-up sensation, with bondage the obvious (and ""notorious"" of the title) trait attributed to her. The actress Gretchen Moll portrays her, and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could, which is really a lot of the success of the film. She's not a simplistic character, even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable (""well, Adam and Eve were naked, weren't they?"" she comments a couple of times). Apparently, the filmmakers leave out the later years of Page's life and leave off with her in a kind of redemptive period, leaving behind the photo shoots for Jesus.In all, the Notrious Bettie Page is not much more than a kind of usual bio-pic presented by HBO films, albeit this time with the stamina for a feature-film release. The best scenes that Harron captures are Page in her ""questionable"" positions, getting photos of her in over-the-top poses and starring in ridiculous films of whips and chains and leather uniforms. This adds a much needed comic relief to the film's otherwise usual nature. It's not that the story behind it is uninteresting, which involves the government's investigation into the 'smut' that came out of such photos and underground magazines. But there isn't much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at, with Page and her complexities or her relationships or to sex and the fifties. It's all given a really neat black and white look and sometimes it seemed as if Harron was progressing some of the black and white photos to be tinted more as it went along. It's a watchable view if you're not too knowledgeable of Bette Page, and probably for fans too.",The Notorious Bettie Page
6,tavm,The Notorious Bettie Page is an interesting look at the title character's period,9,16 June 2007,"First, I've got to say that the black and white cinematography on the Tennesse and New York scenes and the color ones on Miami have an authentic period feel for the '50s that takes you back to a time that seems so long ago. And Gretchen Mol looks stunningly and uncannily close to the title character in all her attitude and revealing poses. Director/co-writer Mary Harron brings some of the contrasts of attitudes concerning what constitutes obscene material by having the Irving Klaw character mentioning that while some bondage scenes of the Broadway musical Kiss Me, Kate is considered acceptable, his bondage photos are considered too raunchy for mailing for certain customers! Another person who's prosecuting the pictures defends a slave girl scene in a Tarzan movie as being in a ""film meant for families""! Any abuse Ms. Bettie Page suffered growing up is mainly implied though she seems to have mostly a sunny disposition concerning both her career and life. Nice to see Sarah Paulson (Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip) as legendary Playboy photographer Bunny Yeager, Lilly Taylor as Irving's sister Paula, and John Cullum (formerly of Northern Exposure) as a Nashville preacher during Bettie's teen years. If not a complete biographical look at the life of Ms. Page, it's certainly a very compelling look at the times and conventions she lived through. Update-12/12/08: I just found out Ms. Page died. All I can say is, Rest in Peace, Pin-Up Queen.",The Notorious Bettie Page
7,michaelRokeefe,She knew what she wanted. And she thought it was right.,9,1 October 2006,"An HBO Presentation of high caliber. Very interesting and captivating. Gretchen Mol plays Bettie Page, who grew up in a religious family in 1940's Nashville, Tennessee. She loved being photographed and in the 1950's, she became a legendary pinup model. Some of her photos were so provocative that they led to a U.S. Senate investigation into pornography; and targeting her immensely popular fetish poses. Miss Page was just a small town girl that with her winsome ""look"" became an erotic icon that enthralls fans to this very day. Fimed in glorious B & W, with bits of color. Miss Mol IS Bettie Page.The cast also features: David Strathairn, John Cullom, Lili Taylor, Chris Bauer and Cara Seymour.",The Notorious Bettie Page
8,Bunuel1976,"THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE (Mary Harron, 2005) ***",7,15 March 2007,"I knew going in who Betty Page was and what kind of work she did to get her notoriety; it's no surprise that the film is made by a woman but, thankfully, there's no overt feminist statement here - however, neither is there much psychological insight into the woman herself! In fact, for all the (admittedly quaint) transgression involved - and considering the fact that Harron had previously made American PSYCHO (2000) - the film retains a fairly detached viewpoint, which rather betrays its being an HBO-funded project.Even so, Gretchen Mol is very adequate in the lead and the film is nonetheless interesting (especially with the points it makes about censorship vis-a'-vis erotica and vintage Hollywood films, and the trial sequence towards the end which effectively puts the axe to Page's professional 'career' and eventually leads to her spiritual rebirth) and enjoyable (thanks also to a practiced if low-key supporting cast that includes Jared Harris, Lili Taylor, Austin Pendleton and David Straitharn) all the way through.Also notable is its vacillation between black-and-white and color: the former is perhaps too austere to be accurate, but the nostalgic oversaturated palette of the latter is quite effective and gives the footage an admirable home-movie quality.",The Notorious Bettie Page
9,writers_reign,Page-Turner,8,4 August 2006,"This will probably appeal to Nostalgia buffs as much as the dirty-raincoat brigade who would do well to save their money. As someone who had never heard of Bettie Page prior to seeing the film I was 'sold' on it by those reviews which emphasized the period feel and stated clearly that the titillation content was virtually non-existent. Page comes across as one of life's optimists or else stupidity personified. Almost certainly a victim of incest at the hands of her father, she goes on to marry a wife-beater, leaves him and still continues to trust men to the extent of agreeing to go dancing with a perfect stranger she meets in the street only to wind up in the woods supplying sex to a dozen or so men who have paid for the privilege. With those kind of experiences behind them most girls would be forgiven for eschewing male company for the rest of their lives but Page deals with it by becoming a model for 'glamor' magazines. This is, of course, a true story and apparently Ms Page is still very much alive and would presumably let out a squawk if she thought the film-makers were misrepresenting the facts so all I can say is that she was a very remarkable person. There is an outstanding central performance and wonderful attention to period detail. Well worth a look.",The Notorious Bettie Page
10,lastliberal,Neo-con Nightmares,4,1 June 2007,"I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and don't really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.She really didn't think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again.The photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a super part here.Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever.",The Notorious Bettie Page
11,george.schmidt,Mol shines as legendary pin-up queen Bettie Page in a fine biopic.,9,24 April 2006,"THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE (2006) ***1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. Mol shines as legendary pin-up queen Bettie Page in a fine biopic.Gretchen Mol is probably best known for being tauted as The Next-It-Girl a few years ago when no one knew who she was despite an infamous cover story by Vanity Fair among other media dubbings but despite a few co-starring roles here and there her predicted stardom seemed to twinkle less brightly until now. Here as the famous pin-up queen Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is indeed a shining star on the rise.Bettie Page was Tennessee born raised as a God-fearing and family oriented proper girl who seemed to find herself the unwarranted object of lust and affection, as she grew older. A gang-rape that is flashbacked is wisely not graphically depicted nor is the subtle showing of her own father having less- than-decent designs for his own kin which is important to understand how Page managed to escape the possible nightmarish life for a career as an actress by heading to New York City in the 1950s when in fact that was the time and place to be to catch lighting in a bottle. What Page didn't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived.A beautiful raven haired sweetheart with a divine figure, Page is spotted on Coney Island one summer day by a black policeman asking to take her photograph which leads to her posing in his basement and eventually to the studios of Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) who cater their kitschy but considered pornographic stills to a unique clientele: fetish types.Although Page is rather naïve she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control - or at least abides in what is offered her as work in that it is not indecent and she is having fun in her increasingly less-clothed portraits - until a Congressional witch-hunt seeks out a few scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. Talented filmmaker Mary Harron and her screen writing partner Guinevere Turner (""An American Psycho"" and ""I Shot Andy Warhol"") streamline the biopic trappings rather neatly and maybe a bit too hasty in getting at who really was Bettie Page although they do justice in depicting an era of uptightness at its zenith. Large thanks to gifted cinematographer Mott Hopfel for his languorously gorgeous black and white images and also the sprinkled color segments that recall Douglas Sirk films of the era for its melodramatic kindlings. Part feminist treaty and part American dream fulfilled the story chugs along nicely with fine performances by its ensemble including the comical Bauer and Taylor as siblings in smut and Harris having a field day as a fellow fotog with a taste for wine and chatter. It's amusing to see Strathairn in a bit of stunt casting as a senator on a campaign for righteousness after portraying news bulldog Edward R. Murrow in his last outing, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" as an opposite the table role.But hats off to the truly fine talents of Mol as the uninhibited yet deeply morale and most importantly intelligent Bettie Page who lets her child-like innocence beam through her bold nudity and now-considered-tame-and-quaint-borderline- kitschy poses that caught the male fancy for decades and is still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the world overall. Mol is perfect and uncannily resembles her portrait's subject down to her knowing-teasing smile. The real Bettie Page was reportedly not involved with the project but apparently gave her blessing and continues to live a somewhat secluded life that is alluded to in the final moments as to having found Jesus and shirking her 'notorious' image once and for all. A shame since this film oddly embraces the resounding decency imbued within its subject, radiating for all to see in its naked splendor.",The Notorious Bettie Page
12,ferguson-6,Show some Constraints,7,22 April 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.The film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done.The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?",The Notorious Bettie Page
13,gradyharp,A 'little goodie two-shoes' approach to Bettie Page?!,5,17 April 2007,"Writer/director Mary Harron (credits include TV episodes on Six Degrees, Big Love, Six Feet Under, The L Word, and Oz as well as films like American Psycho, I Shot Andy Warhol, Winds of Change) has her story of the 1950s pinup model and bondage photo girl Bettie Page down well. In many aspects of the film she is very creative: she elects to tell Bettie's passage into the world of nude/girlie pix modeling from her Nashville,TN Bible Belt beginnings in terse black and white while meandering comic relief passages are in startling color; she has chosen a superb cast (especially Gretchen Mol inhabiting Bettie Page; she recreates the feeling of the 1950s down to the finest detail.The problem with a biography of a sensation such as Page, despite the probable truth of her attitude toward life and her career, is in the manner in which the story is told. Yes, the smarmy aspects of the scandal which surrounded Page are touched upon are even candy-coated or merely passed over quickly. Mol is terrifically credible (and beautiful!) in her portrayal and she is supported by some fine actors (Lili Taylor and Chris Bauer as the funny-but-naughty brother and sister team who introduced Bettie into the world of S&M/bondage shots and films that resulted in a national investigation of pornography), David Strathairn as Estes Kefauver in charge of the hearings over the scandal, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson and others. But in the end it feels like a film noir without the noir. We end up knowing very little about a rather significant 'figure' in the prolific days of girlie mags.

14,Mr-Fusion,Gretchen Mol was meant to play The Pinup Queen of the Universe,7,30 September 2014,"Bettie Page was the most photographed woman of the '50s, and a look at both her life and the nature of sexuality in America at that time would make for a pretty solid biopic. But at 90 minutes, there's no hope of examining everything. That said, THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE does cover the broad strokes. It's very nicely photographed, in both black and white and a blast of chroma during the Miami period. I loved David Strathairn's bit part as Joseph McCarthy, a nice joke on his Edward R. Murrow performance. And the animated magazine covers was a novel touch; this is a well-produced little movie. But it's the nail-on-the-head casting of Gretchen Mol in the titular role that's the real reason to watch this. Mol is perfect; she's gorgeous and seems to imbue that almost innocent quality of the real-life Page, a woman who wasn't inhibited because she didn't see the harm in taking pictures in less (or no) clothing. I was already a fan of the actress, but to her immense credit, she brings the role to life on the screen. Her work here is top-notch. 7/10",The Notorious Bettie Page

16,KineticSeoul,Decent but not all that entertaining or engrossing,5,9 April 2013,"I never knew anything about or even heard of Bettie Page until I saw this movie. And I think it's decent for a HBO flick but nothing amazing but still a decent watch. Now Bettie Page was America's sensational pin-up girl during the 50's that was notorious for her bondage picks which are pretty tame in today's standards. And the setting is in a period when censorship was very tough, to the point some politicians were claiming that pornographic images are worse than communism. Like the title what drives this movie is the characters of Bettie Page. Although it goes in a straightforward biographical film from how she was a young Christian to how she became a pin-up girl. And Bettie Page is a interesting character and despite her very naive personality she was a likable person. Because despite the hardships she faced and major sexual harassment she got from a young age, she still has this bright and cheerful personality about her. And how she still has kind and friendly nature towards everyone without being bitter despite her circumstances. The directing style is slightly unique as well. It has this retro feel to it and when Bettie is in New York it's black and white to bring about that period feel. And when she is in Miami it's colored but still has that retro visuals. Overall this is a alright watch but nothing all that entertaining or engrossing for a movie about the life of a pin-up girl.

17,cherold,"Vacuous, but Mol is Wonderful",6,13 September 2012,"I never feel a dramatic work is successful if at the end I can't figure out why anyone bothered to make it. And that's my problem with this movie. Sure, Gretchen Mol is wonderful, radiating a natural charm and sense of fun that make you really believe that this girl could become a pin-up obsession, and I like the period photography, but the movie doesn't seem to really be about anything.While this movie is about Bettie Page, it doesn't really tell us anything about her. It tells a little of her life - traumatic incidents, failed relationships, acting aspirations - but Bettie seems to wander around with all the thought of a kitten.There are people in this world who live like that, and Bettie may have been one of them, a girl free of introspection (although reading wikipedia suggests she may have been more complex), but that doesn't excuse the lack of introspection in the movie itself. It's not just that this movie doesn't explain Bettie - some people are inexplicable - or that she has a sudden, unpersuasive change of life at the end, it's that the movie doesn't explain *anything*. It makes no attempt to give context to this 1950s battle against pornography (so mild that now you can find stronger stuff on youtube. Its stock supporting characters never come to life, in spite of the talent of the actors involved. The movie doesn't seem to want to say anything about anything.Why was this movie made?

18,lost-in-limbo,She shocked a generation.,8,29 May 2010,"Sex sells but they weren't ready for the kinkiness. Director Mary Harron (American Psycho, I Shot Andy Warhol) crafts out a respectably diverting, but moving bio-pic on legendary cult pin-up sensation Bettie Page. The narrative follows on through her southern childhood of a religious upbringing with a controlling mother to her quest of being an inspired actress (something and then it took off for her with the modelling jobs, especially her participation in outlawed bondage fetish photographs/and films that would cause a ruckus for their deviant nature and would become a target of a Senate investigation. She was a natural in what she did because she loved what she was doing, and became one of the world's first sex icons and a timeless one too. What really makes this one work is the tremendously radiant and fetching Gretchen Mol who really does sincerely morph into Bettie Page's buxom shape and spirited persona. It's an admirably flawless and confident performance. Some of the forlorn encounters/or dilemmas facing her character could have tipped her over the edge or mentally damaged her, but she always seemed to find some sort strength to pull through it. The rest of the performances are truly fitting. Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor are outstanding as Irving and Paula Klaw who set-up and photographed Page's bondage pictures. An impulsive Jared Harris has fun with his part, and has some amusing scenes with Mol that really open up her character. Sarah Paulson, Cara Seymour and John Cullum are also good. Filmed mostly in black and white, Harron presents an ideal period flavour of the times (the 1950's --- sexual repression) and inserts some provocatively stylised filming techniques and a tuneful jazz score. Maybe not as outrageous as it could have been (well anyhow it would be tame by today's standards), but still its quite quirky and risqué in a tasteful sense with exposing flesh/nudity. Page rightly saw nothing wrong about what she did, just another expressive art form but this did affect her ambitions of becoming a serious actress. The story does seem to loose its way in the last third, as it's dramatic structure becomes choppy and briskly concluded. It was an interesting look at the exploration of sexuality and the growing pop-culture that a society at the time couldn't understand or come to grips with.",The Notorious Bettie Page

21,strong-122-478885,"A ""Nice"" Girl & Her ""Naughty"" Profession",5,24 June 2014,"From a religiously hypocritical up-bringing, to sexual abuse by her father, to being gang-raped in her teens, to a failed marriage, Bettie Page (as a determined, young woman in 1949 with nothing much to lose), then, travelled from her hometown of Nashville to N.Y.C.And when Bettie arrived in The Big Apple full of hopes and dreams, she went from being a failure as a legitimate actress, to appearing in cheesecake magazines, to being a bondage & fetish model in sleazy cinema, to becoming a coyly winking, soft-core pin-up girl.And, finally, things went back around, full-circle, to more religious hypocrisy (ho-hum) with Bettie, now in earnest, arguing the same, old tired crap about morality and the question of Adam & Eve's nakedness.Oh, me! Oh, my! Take my word for it - This ""bio"" film certainly could've been a helluva lot better than it was.As hot & sizzling & tantalizing as this picture should've been, unfortunately, its final product was a pretty damn tame and light-weight look at Page's career as a piece of provocative ""pin-up"" eye-candy throughout the conservative, yet turbulent, 1950s.Though actress Gretchen Mol looked simply sensational (in any stage of undress) throughout the story, I found that due to some very poor scripting decisions the Bettie Page character was presented as being too unbelievably naive in regards to the reality and true nature of the sort of employment that she had landed herself into. And rarely, if ever, did Page, at any time, seem to actually find a moment to completely enjoy the fruits of her obvious celebrity status.At a mere 90 minute running time, this film seemed to actually move along at a literal snail's pace. And contrary to what one might think, its subject matter, though intriguing, just wasn't enough to hold my undivided attention.I don't mean to sound downright sexist here, but I personally think that this picture suffered its greatest deficit by being directed by a woman.It appeared to me that director Mary Harron deliberately tried to white-wash and sanitize the notoriety right out of the Bettie Page character, making her appear to be more of an innocent victim of circumstance rather than an active and knowing participant in the manufacturing of ""smut"".",The Notorious Bettie Page
22,dfranzen70,"Mol fantastic, but movie a little shallow",6,25 October 2006,"Bettie Page, for those of you not in the know, was a famous pinup girl in the forties and fifties. Yes, before the Internet, you young whippersnapper, before even cable TV. Back then, if you wanted to get a peek of some naked breasts, you had to hie thyself to your corner newsstand and furtively buy yourself a copy of what was euphemistically called ""mens"" magazines. Hey, this was before even Playboy; looking at photographs of nekked chicks was seen as truly deviant behavior, and even then the pictures that appeared in those magazines were, by today's standards, quite tame.Page was a naive farmgirl from Kingsport, Tennessee who decided to give acting a try up in New York - and quickly found out that it was those dirty pictures that paid the rent. At first she took the photo gigs as a means to get by while she worked on her acting career, but eventually no one took her seriously as an actress; she was always the ""notorious Bettie Page."" After her softcore career stalled - thanks in no small part to some witchhunting by Congress - Page converted to Christianity, perhaps subconsciously trying to atone for her ""sins."" She's still alive, too, although she's stayed well out of the limelight for a long, long time.Anyway, Gretchen Mol plays her in this movie. Now, most of you might not be familiar with Mol's work, but she typically plays the girlfriend or young wife or any number of small female roles. She played Matt Damon's girl in Rounders, for example, and I found her to be pretty annoying in it, but she also played the love interest in The Thirteenth Floor opposite Craig Bierko, where she was somewhat more palatable. Could be she's on her way up, ready to be discovered via a huge breakout role, and the role of Bettie Page just might be the one. For one thing, Mol really acts in this movie; she's not there just for show, and she can't get by on her cutesy looks alone. In fact, she really disappears into the role; Mol herself is blonde as blonde can be, while Page was famed for her brunette tresses. Squint a little, and you might be able to tell it's Gretchen Mol, but probably not, and that's a sure sign that her acting has swayed you.The movie moves along pretty steadily, flagging only during the courtroom scenes - which are sparse - and maybe a little near the end, but it's all compact and likable. One complaint might be that we don't get to see far beneath the surface of Page's character; what leads her to the decisions she makes? Some of her earliest history is necessarily rushed (the director wants to get to the good stuff of the bondage and nudity), so Page's motivations aren't always well explored. We're left with a superficial treatment of a fascinating character.But luckily, Mol rises above her material, bringing so much of Page's enthusiasm and mystery that you quickly forget about the nuance issue. Plus she looks pretty darn good naked.",The Notorious Bettie Page
23,Chris_Docker,A powerful film on the power of ignorance,9,26 July 2006,"Film can be a looking glass to see the world in a new light. Good Night and Good Luck, for instance, offered parallels to modern judgement-without-evidence and encroachments on freedom. It is easier to examine a moral problem when it is not too close to home: by putting it in a fictional or historic context removed from our immediate situation. With pornography, we consider ourselves 'enlightened' and our forefathers to be hidebound by quaint ideas - usually involving fire and brimstone, but the definition of what is obscene can easily fall prey to ignorance and unscientific interpretation instead of evidence. Bettie Page was a cult icon of an era which included not just McCarthyism but the banning of comics (such as Tales from the Crypt) on the basis that they would turn youths into half-mad juvenile delinquents. This film, developed from key questions raised in her life, poses dilemmas that are as relevant today as back in 1950.Our film opens with two key scenes. In the first, we see well-dressed, respectable looking men in a seedy bookshop. One of them asks for pictures of women in kinky boots and being restrained - then turns out to be an undercover cop conducting a sting. The second scene shows Bettie Page, waiting to be called as a witness, looking quite demure, as if she had just come out of church.The first 50mins are in black & white. Old fashioned film effects such as wipes and fades add to the sense that we are watching a film from bygone years, as do the mannerisms of the cast, skilfully recreated 1950s scenes, contemporaneous slang phrases and the terse dialogue associated with film-making of the period. Archive footage is frequently intercut - which will delight many and irritate others. In keeping with its theme, the movie is almost a collection of different types of photography-in-motion, and the older clips of fabulous beaches and landmarks juxtapose well against Bettie's classic poses hearken back to an age of 'health & nature' magazines . . . although I admit that if you are not captivated by the story you may find the effect a bit choppy.Very soon, we go into flashback. Bettie escapes a Depression Years downtrodden life in Nashville, enlivened only with church singing and soul-saving, and goes alone to make her own way. After her initial success, her modelling work splits into two strands: the mainstream glamour work focussing on her over-the-rainbow smile, and the 'specialist interest' photos involving dressing up in high-heeled boots and light bondage gear. In an earlier audition (reminiscent of a scene with Naomi Watts' character in Mulholland Drive - who was also called Betty), she gives a performance that is full of emotion, contrasting with her normal animated, cheerful (but ultimately bland) day-to-day expression. Is part of her still unfulfilled? Bettie is frequently rejected in auditions once they realise she is the well-known pin-up girl. But we have never been asked to feel sorry for Bettie Page: her abusive childhood is quickly referenced and skipped over; when she is raped by four hometown lads, we see only the threat and then Bettie recovering and surviving, picking herself up in deserted woodland, and putting on the brave face of someone who refuses to lie down and die.Although no nudity is involved, it's Bettie's special interest photos that eventually arouse trouble. When we go back to the court, the opinions of a clergyman on the corrupting influence of such photos are taken as evidence. A psychologist authoritatively says how the photos lead to 'suicide, murder and psychosis' in youngsters who are exposed to them (presumably not in that order). Eventually a star witness explains how his son's life came to an end as a result of such photos - 'being 'trussed up like that'. It is not made clear how being 'trussed up' causes death). The text accompanying a series of Bettie's photographs in a magazine tell how she was forced to endure 'terrible agonies' with the fetish restraints (the audience knows that she actually found them quite hilarious and that the wordings, like the photos themselves, were pure dramatisations). After a 12hr wait, Bettie is told her evidence - she is the one person who could state definitively that she was not photographed in agony - will 'not be required'. The 'horrors' of the photos have been proved.If this all sounds like the dark ages which we have left, consider a recent (2003) incident in which an Ann Summers advert was banned. It said, ""for fashion and passion whip along to your local store,"" with a photograph of a woman's back. She's wearing a bra and thong and her hands are handcuffed behind her back. The lingerie and sex toys company, that targets female consumers (and also supports charities fighting domestic violence) said its adverts aimed, ""to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality."" One might conclude that the prejudice and ignorance of the Betty Page investigations still holds currency.Bettie's religious views are integral to the story, just as the concept of sin is integral to Christianity and contributes to the 'forbidden' nature of sexual enjoyment frequently prevalent in the UK and US - as opposed to the more factual approach found in continental Europe. It could be argued the formulae of sin and redemption, and ""being saved"", are even reflected in mating patterns that perpetuate traditional male dominance. A policeman making a friendly (but sexually motivated) approach to Bettie outside the courtroom offers to 'save' her from loneliness. The knight-in-shining-armour might be chivalrous, but it also assumes a woman in need of rescue.Love it or hate it, The Notorious Bettie Page is an unusual and extraordinary film, and a moral wake-up call for those that heed it. There is excellent ensemble acting, and Gretchen Mol, as Bettie, is remarkable as the whole film succeeds or falls on her powerful performance.",The Notorious Bettie Page
24,EVOL666,"Another Interesting Bio On the ""World's Greatest Pin-Up""...",8,2 October 2006,"I've seen a few of these Bettie bios - and they all primarily cover the same basic material. The main difference is typically the acting and budget level of the film. THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is one of the more ""polished"" of these films, and would be a good intro for anyone interested in some basic background on the woman that many consider to be the ""World's Greatest Pin-up Girl"".Gretchen Mol (competently) plays Bettie during her modeling years - and we follow Bettie as a young girl in a religious town in Tennessee to her move to New York. With her dreams of acting taking a backseat to her career as a pin-up girl and bondage model, Bettie eventually returns to religion and leaves the modeling world to basically disappear into obscurity, until the recent ""revival"" in interest in her and her career.Mol is a believable Bettie and the production of the film overall is well-done. No real new ground to be covered, as most of Bettie's life up til her being ""born again"" is pretty common knowledge - but THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is still an entertaining and informative look into the bondage-queen's life.

25,EUyeshima,Mol's Striking Performance Transcends a Luscious Albeit Skin-Deep Look at a 1950's Icon,7,21 April 2006,"Gretchen Mol so perfectly embodies the title role both physically and dramatically that you can almost forgive the somewhat lackluster treatment of 1950's pin-up model Bettie Page's early life story presented in this 2006 movie. In a deceptively facile performance, the actress successfully submerges her blonde, Nordic beauty to play the naïve, raven-haired Southern girl with a refreshing lack of self-consciousness. Director Mary Harron and screenwriter Guinevere Turner deserve kudos for making a film that does not judge Page's notoriety or provide dime-store psychoanalysis on why she felt comfortable posing for fetish and bondage photos sold under the counter and by mail order. The offset to the filmmakers' approach is that we get is a series of episodes that are intended to show how her persona was formed, all within the context of her guileless acceptance no matter how outwardly outrageous some of the things that are asked of her.The time-spanning plot tracks Page from her abused adolescence in Nashville through a brief first marriage to a life-changing trip to New York that begins her inadvertent modeling career while she attempts to become a respectable stage actress. Tenaciously holding on to her strong religious beliefs, Page gains the attention of an army of shutterbug club photographers who have her pose in various states of undress. With each new session, she is asked to pose in increasingly deviant situations. As a framing device for the plot, the filmmakers use the 1955 Senate subcommittee hearing headed by Presidential hopeful Estes Kefauver, who is aggressively looking to clean up the pornography industry. In the eye of the media storm is Page, who views her scandalous photos as harmless expressions of her unfulfilled acting career. With a lot of questions left unanswered, the story simply stops at a point soon after her retirement from modeling with no indication of what happens to Page afterward.On the plus side, the movie has a great period look with cinematographer Mott Hupfel bringing out a luscious sheen to the black-and-white camera-work with effective forays into saturated color, in particular, when the story moves to Miami. Other than Mol, Harron seems to encourage her cast to act in the stilted, exaggerated style of movies produced during the 1950's as Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor (who seems to be channeling Thelma Ritter) play the Klaws, a money-minded couple who run the photography studio responsible for most of her pictures; Jared Harris especially oily as bondage expert and magazine publisher John Willie; and David Strathairn in an extended cameo as Kefauver.Above everything else is the intoxicating Mol, who holds the disparate events of Page's life together though her genuinely magnetic quality. Try to take your eyes off her as she unaffectedly poses au natural in the park for a gawking amateur photographer, and you see an actor completely comfortable with herself. But more importantly, look at her as her scandal-ridden reputation weighs on her as others point out how base and lurid her photos are, and you see a beacon into the radical transformation that Page must have experienced. It's a triumphant performance for an actress victimized by premature publicity heralding her as the next big thing nearly a decade earlier. I just wish the rest of the film reflected a little more of the depth that Mol does.",The Notorious Bettie Page
26,fertilecelluloid,Fascinating biopic lacking a dynamic resolution,7,18 April 2006,"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very interesting. Betty, as portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a pleasant, girl-next-door type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly wasn't anything ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight ""community"". Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world. Because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, it's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon.",The Notorious Bettie Page
27,ShootingShark,"Interesting, Touching, Well-Crafted Story Of Quintessential Fifties Pinup Queen",6,3 December 2009,"Bettie Page is a young woman from Tennessee who drifts to New York City in the forties and starts to make a name for herself as a glamour model. When she starts to pose for bondage fetish pictures, it causes ructions in her relationships and she starts to question the value of her vocation in the eyes of her Christian faith.A lot of biopics tend to be about pompous figures from world history, but here's one about someone who was genuinely interesting and lovable. What's most intriguing about Page is that somehow she represents both the glamorous, sexy, fun-lovin' lure of America and the seedy, repressed, puritanical mentality that permeates its society. She's a Bad Girl who was in fact really a Good Girl, and her forthright take-it-or-leave-it attitude towards herself is refreshingly honest and commendable. Mol is fantastic in the lead; with her broad face and blonde curls she doesn't look anything like the real Page, but somehow when she gets the black fringe haircut and starts cheesecake posing for the guys in the house she suddenly blossoms into an amazing dead ringer for the real deal, carefully developing the character's aspirations and doubts. The support cast is good, with fine turns especially from Taylor and Paulson as snappers Paula Klaw and Bunnie Yeager. For whatever reason, Page is popular with women as well as men, and it's refreshing that this film was mostly made by women. Harron's direction is excellent, with nice pacing, mood, comic touches (the recreations of Page's stag loops are wonderful) and terrific juxtaposition of black-and-white New York with colourful Florida. Guinivere Turner's contribution as writer and co-producer is also tremendous. I've always been a huge fan of Page, purely because she was such a striking-looking woman - nobody looked like her or smiled like her. The movie charts her life mostly through her fifties heyday; she had some hard times after that, but her work had a renaissance in the eighties (notably through the character Betty in Dave Stevens' comic The Rocketeer and a fanzine by Greg Theakston) and this movie is a great celebration of her life. She died in 2008. Funded by HBO as a made-for-cable project, but also given a limited theatrical release.",The Notorious Bettie Page
28,nycritic,Venus in the Flesh,8,4 March 2007,"For most of the latter half of the Twentieth century and until today, she has become a myth only exceeded by Marilyn. Entire books have been published about her, mainly photo-books displaying her trademark hairstyle -- raven black, cut in bangs, shoulder-length --, the knowing wink in her blue eyes, the curves in her creamy body, the playfulness of her poses even when they were ""naughty"" and had a sadomasochistic bent, then unheard of and considered perverse. However, not much is truly known of this woman who lives a quiet life out in anonymity (and prefers to, even now that she is an icon). What THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE tries to capture in its 100 minute run is that mystery, if there is one: who was this woman, where she came from, what baggage did she have, her struggles with trying to become a respected actress, her incursion into the world of cheesecake that eventually led to a certain infamy and her conversion into the world of religion. Moving from a textured black and white to a glorious Technicolor palette, Mary Harron's movie is quite a vision... but it's surface and no substance, images without real spirit, which translates into being a moving picture book which includes all of Page's best shots turned into motion. Gretchen Mol dives into the role and leads this movie all by herself, but even then, it's as if she were playacting Page instead of truly embodying her. And that is perhaps, exactly how the real Bettie Page wants it.",The Notorious Bettie Page
29,oneguyrambling,The Notorious B-e-P,6,3 February 2012,"The Notorious BeP reeks of being another gussied up biopic with largely fabricated events or versions only included to justify making the film in the first place. In fact were it not for the nudity I can see little memorable or notorious about this film at all – the same might be said for Ms Page herself.In the 50s America was quite a repressed and puritanical place, and despite all the subsequent changes in attitude and understanding every current affairs show still seems to inform us that this is still the case today.Anything vaguely interesting is quite illegal, especially vaguely interesting sex related things.Everything from now should be read with the following lead off sentence: ""According to the film""  young Bettie Page had a repressed childhood. a rushed marriage failed when her husband treated her with disdain, and often violence. Bettie decided a fresh start was in order and moved to New York. She enrolled in acting classes but when success – and cashflow – wasn't immediately forthcoming a random request to model by a photographer lead her into the industry. Page's innocence meant few inhibitions, and this carefree attitude to nudity – and a beaming smile – lead to more popularity both from readers and lensmen, which in turn created more offers from more varied sources. these ""varied sources"" end up being fetishist stuff including bondage and high heels. Bettie (apparently) adopts the ""what the hey"" attitude and embraces these new fads, giving her all to photographers, even if she didn't understand what people saw in these bizarre new trends.even though she didn't think she was doing anything horribly wrong, Bettie still didn't give full disclosure to her own family.one day a non-industry person opens up and gives Bettie the real public opinion on her antics. Bettie is confused. After all, she never meant to be Notorious.Look the film seemed to me to give a fairly favourable account of Bettie's life and supplied a bunch of alibis and excuses, more or less saying she didn't choose the industry, it chose her. Gretchen Mol is effective as portraying Bettie as somewhat innocent and likable – even if remaining oblivious to what everyone thought for years seems improbable – and yes Gents she does get naked a few times for brief periods.Given that she herself thought the whole thing was a bit of a laugh you could hardly call these scenes hot or erotic though.Similarly as the filmmaker (at least to me) seemed to think making this film warranted excising any sense of Bettie selecting her career path – there are hardly any ""bad eggs"" to be found in an industry that must have been quite seedy and underground even a lifetime ago – thereby claiming the ""nice girl who didn't know any better"" card, I can hardly call it compelling or interesting viewing, but a sanitized version of what actually might have a happened.Final Rating – 5 / 10. For a film begging for notoriety in its very title, and pertaining to the life of a nude and fetish model, this is tame and flaccid, stuff indeed.",The Notorious Bettie Page
30,blott2319-1,Tedious and boring,2,27 March 2021,"I'm starting to think that biopics might not be for me. The Notorious Bettie Page is another in a long line of movies I've watched in this genre that I find tedious and annoying. There doesn't seem to be a point to the movie other than showing that men have been into kinky stuff for more than a century. I didn't even feel like this movie took a stand on whether that's OK or whether it is wrong. The movie was so flat and noncommittal that it managed to be boring. I think part of that also might be the fact that Gretchen Mol didn't bring much to the table. She's an attractive actress, and they have her use a charming southern accent, but I got zero emotion out of her performance. They don't even do a good job of establishing a discernible timeline of events. There was one scene where Bettie walks into a room with a guy she met earlier and they were acting like boyfriend and girlfriend. All I could think was ""I wonder when that happened, and why they didn't find it necessary to tell us about it."" Yet rather than making Bettie Page a 3-dimensional character and digging into her life story, this movie seemed more interested in hitting the highlights of her career one at a time. The Notorious Bettie Page is a dull movie on a subject that should probably never be dull. Even though I wouldn't enjoy the movie much more, this definitely feels like a person that should be featured in an edgy biopic that is polarizing to viewers.

31,hall895,Unexpectedly charming,7,6 February 2007,"Who would have ever thought that a movie about the ""notorious"" bondage queen Bettie Page could turn out to be rather sweet and ultimately very charming? Movies certainly have the capacity to surprise us now and again and The Notorious Bettie Page certainly does that. After watching this film you may come away with the idea that Bettie Page was the quintessential girl next door who just happened to pose for some rather interesting pictures. She may not have been America's Sweetheart but, at least in this film, Bettie Page doesn't come across as being particularly notorious either.This film's charm mostly comes from the terrific performance of Gretchen Mol in the title role. This must certainly have been a rather challenging and not entirely comfortable part to play. But in watching the film you get the sense that Mol is genuinely having a good time playing the part. And that makes it much easier to believe what the movie is trying to sell you, that Bettie Page actually enjoyed her rather unusual career. Or if she didn't enjoy it at least she didn't mind it. She understood it for what it was and realized it was a lot more innocent than it seemed. Certainly a lot more innocent than the government investigators in the film who tried to put a stop to this ""pornography"" would want you to believe. The film provides an honest look at what was considered obscene and often illegal a mere five decades ago. But the movie doesn't take sides, it just lays out the facts and shows you the prevailing attitudes of society at that time. You can decide for yourself whether we were better off then or now.The Notorious Bettie Page is not a perfect movie by any means. The story is a little thin, the plot moves rather slowly at times. Often it seems the story really isn't moving forward, we're just killing time between photo shoots. But in the end, the movie works. The film is beautifully photographed, mostly in black and white with occasional color scenes which seem exceedingly vibrant. Getting a chance to see what government and polite society deemed ""unacceptable"" a mere fifty or so years ago is eye-opening considering the mentality of our world today where seemingly anything goes. The story of the sweet, innocent Southern girl turned pinup goddess is an intriguing one. And the film does a very good job of allowing you to get to know the woman behind the photos. It seems Bettie Page was not at all who you may have thought she was if all you had to judge her on was a glossy photo on a printed page. And Gretchen Mol does a simply fantastic job of bringing this icon to life. The supporting cast does solid work but this is clearly Mol's movie to carry and she is certainly up to the task. She turns in a brilliant performance in what is ultimately a smart, witty, enjoyable and surprisingly charming film.",The Notorious Bettie Page
32,Andy-296,Interesting if conventional biopic of Bettie Page,7,10 January 2010,"An entertaining though somewhat conventional biopic of the famous bondage model from the fifties. Gretchen Mol acquits herself nicely in the title role – even though she looks to be quite a bit taller than Bettie was. As played in this movie, Page was a naive and devoutly Christian girl from Tennessee, who nevertheless, after moving to New York, became the main model of a genre that was considered extremely shocking, not to mention illegal, at the time (of course, by the standards of today's pornography, Bettie's photos look now almost innocent). Why she did so is never quite explained, unless you consider a flashback to a gang rape during her teenage years as a valid explanation. In a final analysis, you probably can't explain why a nice girl agree to model in what was then considered extremely shocking set pieces, except by falling into amateur psychology. Though the religion of her main photographers, Irving and Paula Claw is never mentioned explicitly, it is nevertheless quite obvious - therefore, the most provocative thing in this movie is not the nudity but the subtext of a small town southern Christian girl exploited by callous Jewish pornographers.

33,MrGKB,Satisfied this Page fan...,8,25 June 2006,"...but the general moviegoer's mileage may vary in Mary ""American Psycho"" Harron's stylized look at the American sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal Queen of Curves, Bettie Page.I'll not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of Ms. Page, a prim and proper valedictorian from Nashville, Tennessee, who moved to New York in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the Bondage Queen of the Universe. Nor will I run through the sketchy bio-pic plot of ""The Notorious Bettie Page,"" though I offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film (a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind), improper use of a period camera notwithstanding. Finally, I won't belabor the timely applicability of the film's themes of innocence and perversion, freedom and control, the sacred and the secular; they're there for the viewer to absorb, if they wish. The more things change, the more they stay the same, as the saying goes.What I will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page. Truth is, Mol's face looks almost nothing like Bettie's, nor is she particularly built like Bettie (although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts, and no fool, I!). She doesn't even sport the thick, dark bush that concealed Ms. Page's most intimate charms, but the fact remains that Mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of Bettie Page in every way, shape, and form. It is a bravura ""comeback"" from an undeserved semi-obscurity. I've never met Ms. Page (and sadly, never will, most likely), but I've devoured the photos and videos, and read all the bios and interviews available, bought the trading cards and other odds and ends, and to be honest, lusted for Ms. Page ever since I first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime. Mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as I have come to conceive her, no pun intended, in what I consider to be an Oscar-worthy performance. Liv Tyler could never have matched Mol's shining intensity of characterization in a million years, and I, for one, am grateful she left the project. Not that I'd mind seeing her totally naked, I hasten to add, but I can't imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of Bettie Page.""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is not for everyone, any more than bondage and discipline are. I suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters; legions of devoted Page fans and the curious will see to that. I can only hope that the DVD will be chock full of enough Bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job Mol has done.Beyond that, a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast, especially Lili Taylor and Chris Bauer as Paula and Irving Klaw, whose celebrity photo business was Bettie's doorway to immortality.A final note to the young scribe who opined that Ms. Page had no effect on his generation: take a good look at Madonna's cone brassiere and get back to us. Bettie Page is, whether you know it or not, the true Godmother of fetishwear. Without her, Madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed.",The Notorious Bettie Page
34,johno-21,Gretchen Mol is Bettie Page,7,7 February 2006,"I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by HBO to be shown on their cable network sometime this year. This movie presents Page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and B&D stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50's pinup icon. This film is supposedly based on the book ""The Real Bettie Page"" by Richard Foster. It's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel. I have the book called ""Bettie Page The Life of a Pinup Legend"" that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of Page and I must say that this movie reproduces on film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of those famous photo's very accurately. Mol herself with the Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only does she have the Bettie Page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect. And her body is as close to a replica of Page's as possible. Terrific casting. The story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better. But this is a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it a 7.0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it's viewing when it comes on TV.",The Notorious Bettie Page
35,fwomp,Great Filming/Great History But Poor Scripting,5,19 October 2006,"THE NOTORIOUS BETTY PAIGE is intelligently filmed, using grainy black and white film stock that gives it a period piece feel. And, unfortunately, this is the most notable part of the entire production. Although actress Gretchen Mol does an excellent acting job (even when completely naked), the story fails simply because there's little to no understanding as to Betty's motivations.That Betty Paige was one of the first celebrated pin-ups in the world is well known. Her leather and bondage photos launched her into an underground fetish realm that soon sparked congressional hearings on the matter, too. But it was her infectious innocence that most people comment on and Mol certainly got that aspect down pat. Where the movie blurs is the understanding of Betty's life experiences, and this portion fails miserably thanks to a script lacking such content.For instance  In the beginning of the flick we're with Betty while she sits in church with her mother. From this we are supposed to surmise (I guess) that Betty is fairly pious. But sitting in church does not equate to piety. In fact, Betty is seen flirting with a young boy, so this didn't jive with any sort of religious binding she may have felt towards the end of the movie; she does ""turn to Christianity"" in the end, as history tells us. So everything from her naïve attitudes towards her pictures to her comfort level with nudity didn't make sense in terms of her religious attitudes at the beginning and end.The other portion that is bothersome is the lack of any angst. Betty is so comfortable with what her fetish photo sessions that we don't feel there's any problem with it. We never get outside of Betty (except for the congressional hearings which, again, are lacking any intensity), so never really see what others think of what she's doing, thus giving us no sense of any wrong-doing. The congressional hearings are just barely touch on and give little to no understanding as to how they got started, too.That Betty is possibly molested by her father is also alluded to but never fully explored. The assumption (again, I'm guessing) is that the audience is supposed to make the connection between her childhood abuse and her choice as a sexual icon later in life. But we only see one little snippet (about eight seconds of actual film time) on this topic and then it is summarily dropped.Although the great black and white photography and the fascinating history surrounding this sexual dynamo may be appealing on one level, the fouled-up script makes it too easily forgettable.",The Notorious Bettie Page
36,TheNorthernMonkee,"Well acted, but far too pretentious",1,3 July 2007,"SPOILERS If there is ever any example that one person can indeed make a difference, it is when you examine the evolution of our attitudes to nudity. Whether it is those who exposed more like Bettie Page or porn baron Larry Flint, or those who tried to have it covered up like Mary Whitehouse, the views of society have often been effected by the rare individual.In ""The Notorious Bettie Page"", we get to learn about the enigmatic Ms Page and the ways her liberal attitude to nudity revolutionised the world. A story worth telling, it is also a role superbly played by Gretchen Mol. Yet, for all the decent acting, the film drags excruciatingly, and whilst black and white cinematography is so often used to great effect, here it comes across as pretentious and insulting. Playing on our emotions, the lack of colour tries to force us to feel emotions towards this character, which are at the same time undermined by the plot which tires and bores. The story is simply too much of the same thing and there's remarkably little substance.All in all, ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" could have been something so much better. With some great acting performances and a story worth telling, there is potential there. It is a shame therefore that with a weak script and some truly awful cinematography, it would be such a dire film. If you fancy seeing some good acting, watch this film. Be warned though, it will bore you senseless.",The Notorious Bettie Page

38,Son_of_Mansfield,The Mysterious Bettie Page.,7,16 March 2008,"Gretchen Mol gets under the skin of the pinup queen. She nails the playful Page. Watching her in the buff or dominating her fellow models in knee high boots brings Bettie's photos to life and that is the strength of the film. It's when anything is said that the movie sags thanks to the weak screenplay from Guinevere Turner, writer of Uwe Boll's Bloodrayne. The dialogue is simplistic and there isn't much that happens once we see Bettie getting into the fetish business. The audience, who should be at least somewhat knowledgeable about Page's photos, is never given much insight into the woman herself. The real Bettie Page, who had nothing to do with the film, was less than ecstatic despite this being a love letter to her.",The Notorious Bettie Page
39,DonFishies,The film is nowhere near as strong as Mol's performance,7,4 January 2007,"I am not going to lie. Despite looking interesting, I watched The Notorious Bettie Page because I had heard (and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film), that Gretchen Mol got naked in it. I have never been a fan of Mol, but I cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes. Yes, that may be perverted, but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie, and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be.The film chronicles Bettie Page's (Mol) life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the South, and onto her new life in New York. She wants to be an actress, but she has to pay bills too. After taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach, Page slowly becomes a modeling sensation, and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs.I feel the briefness of the film (just over ninety minutes) is both a curse and blessing for it. On one hand, the film never overstays its welcome. You get to know Page within a few short minutes, and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back. But it curses the film as well, because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on. She just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film. You just sit there, and attempt to absorb it all, and more just comes right at you. It feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film. It begs for longer sequences, and begs more for even longer explanations. It does not feel rushed; it just does not feel all there.Another bit of a fumble, although a bit more of a curiosity, is the use of colour throughout the film. The majority is in black and white, but frequently, splashes and sequences of colour do emerge. But while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on, it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white. It gets confusing, and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on.While it may fumble a bit with the actions, the film stays dead-on with its themes. Page, who I know little to nothing about, is played off innocently, and her world is exactly the same. Save for a few shady characters during her teenage years, everyone she encounters is an innocent, and everything she does has an innocence to it. I never thought I would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved, but here, it truly is something to marvel at. All at once, it is beautiful and innocent. Even the most sexually perverted moments in the film (albeit tame compared to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feeling to them. There is just something about the way Mol's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films. It just feels so natural and so wondrous, that if there were any reason to watch the film, it would be to see the spectacular depictions of Mol's body as she plays Bettie Page.The other reason is Mol herself. As Page, she exemplifies that 1950's Southern belle everyone knows (or can at least imagine). Despite her profession, she is still a normal person, and still looks at herself as being religious. Mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky-cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950's. She plays her with such matter-of-factness that you would be hard-set not to think that Mol was actually Bettie Page herself.Unfortunately, the supporting cast have very little moments to shine, and are totally overshadowed by Mol's wonderful performance. None of them do anything particularly pleasing, and none of them really have that same strength in their role as Mol does. This is not really the fault of the actors, but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with. Many of them are totally recognizable, such as Oscar-nominee David Strathairn (in a role a little too close to one of his better performances), Sarah Paulson (recent Golden Globe nominee for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip), and character actor Lili Taylor, but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay. None of these characters are really developed, and they really just stand as character cut-outs who Mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance.Really, this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity, and for Gretchen Mol's excellent performance of Bettie Page. Everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be. Had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story, this film would have been a much better biographical film. As it stands, it is just a vehicle for Mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress.7/10.",The Notorious Bettie Page
40,dave13-1,Interesting drama is a bit thin on character.,6,30 April 2012,"Bettie Page, pin-up queen, was perhaps the most photographed woman of the 1950s, posing for professional and amateur photographers alike and appearing in men's magazines of all sorts from the mainstream to Playboy and bondage fetish books. The latter brought her to the attention of crusading Sen. Kefauver's committee on pornography, putting an end to her modeling career and her aspirations as an actress. The movie starts with her being called to testify and flashing back through her early years, where we see her as a free spirit who lived to pose for cameras. Despite a religious upbringing, she saw nothing wrong with what she was doing and was consequently puzzled by the strong reactions of those who did. Since this is the central issue of the movie a somewhat deeper probing of her character would seem necessary to reconcile the conflict, but we just don't get it. Despite being front and center in just about every shot in the movie, Bettie emerges simply as a sweet woman who was a little ahead of her time, and not much more.The movie has a nice period look, though, and creates an unusual portrait of professional pornographers as being something other than exploiters. Here they just like to play dress up in fetish costumes and take pictures. The implication, of course, is that the purchasers of such material, not the makers, are the perverts.",The Notorious Bettie Page
41,grendelkhan,A Cliffs Notes version of Bettie's life.,7,29 September 2006,"Although The Notorious Bettie Page is well acted and shot, is is, at best, a Cliffs Notes version of Bettie's biography. The film mainly centers on her work with Irving and Paula Klaw, the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos. It does not detail her life after posing, aside from her religious rebirth. It cites ""The Real Bettie Page"", by Richard Foster as a source, but it ignores Bettie's later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital. The narrow focus of the biography can be debated, but the majority of Bettie's fans and the ""civilians"" would probably be more interested in her modeling career, which is what they get.The film is well acted, with Gretchen Mol faithfully reproducing the look of Bettie, as well as conveying the sweetness that her photos exuded. The character is played as rather naive, a probable byproduct of interviews given by Bettie in recent years. It is more likely that Bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but rationalized it as acting and costumes.The supporting cast is also outstanding, with Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor playing Irving and Paula Klaw, and David Strathairn as Estes Kefauver. The film errs with the character of John Willie, played by Jared Harris. John Willie never met Bettie Page and was not involved in photo shoots with the Klaws. Harris plays Willie a bit like Peter O'Toole, in his more debauched state.Despite the quality of acting, the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth. The story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know Bettie. Much like her photos, it's just an image. It does tend to exaggerate Bettie's notoriety. Her photos were mainly seen in and around New York, in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications. Her real fame came after her photos were reprinted in the late 70's and 80's, and the Cult of Betty Page (as her name was usually spelled) grew. Bettie's greatest exposure (pardon the pun) was in Playboy, appearing in the January 1955 issue (the Christmas photo, which is staged in reverse in the film).The film is well done, if rather shallow. It is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances. It hits the high points of Bettie's life, but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth. The ending is rather a let down. It feels rather abrupt. Still, the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in Bettie, or even the time period. The soundtrack is great, really pulling the viewer into the 1950's. If nothing else, the film stands as a showcase for America's burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its Puritan past. It's also a peek at an icon for both men and women.",The Notorious Bettie Page
42,wrlang,notorious is right,7,6 November 2006,"The Notorious Bettie Page is about the mid 1900s pinup and BDSM star of the same name. I think Gretchen Mol was actually better looking than Bettie Page. Mol did seem to get the character spot on with that innocent sexuality. It's hard to believe that Page was relatively ignorant of the type of people that buy the type of porn she put out, but then she did seem to have a few terrible events in her life to overcome to keep her spirits up. I also find it hard to believe the porn photo shoots were as respectful as they were portrayed. They did some good cinematography moving back and forth between black and white and color. The whole setup was pretty realistic. Considering the subject matter, it was done in good taste.",The Notorious Bettie Page
43,socrates99,"If all movies could do this, filmmakers would be our true heroes",9,22 November 2006,"I remember seeing a pretty tame picture of Bettie Page in the 60s and being unmistakably convinced of her unique perfection. I longed to have a girlfriend just like her, though no one has ever even reminded me of her. I studied her photo but could not make out why she stood out, but the connection was somehow personal. She was certainly beautiful but there are plenty of beautiful women. Was I just a kid infatuated with a particularly well photographed pinup? Now decades later the idea that someone could bring Bettie Page accurately to life seems impossible, and I almost didn't rent this film I was so convinced it would only ruin my image of her. Now having seen this film I am almost speechless. This film is almost achingly perfect and utterly devastating to anyone thinking women can't direct. To my mind there is only one serious flaw in this film which luckily is overwhelmed with all that is right with it: Lili Taylor carries too much baggage with her and almost single-handedly torpedoes this film's more delicate achievements. But on the other hand, Gretchen Mol will shoot to the top of your list of unbelievable women who especially we men need to thank our lucky stars for, for her choice of profession. If she hadn't become an actress, no man could be secure enough to let us guys get to know her. To say she's wonderful in the part is wholly inadequate. She's permanently and quite adoringly etched onto my memory.And when I think that women made this film, I'm a little intimidated. Harron and Turner clearly saw what I saw so many years ago in a black and white photo, and made a film true to that vision. I would have bet no one would have the artistry and sheer karma to duplicate that impossibly lucky photography, but I've been proved quite wrong with this unforgettable film. I don't remember seeing the 'naughtier' pictures of Bettie Page but, for me, she's who Marilyn Monroe is to so many others: a kind of unwitting but undeniable goddess who seems totally inexplicable given the world she was born to. She's proof that greater things are more possible than they seem.",The Notorious Bettie Page
44,gsygsy,triumphing over adversity,5,14 August 2006,"Gretchen Mol gives an inspired, accomplished, endearing performance in the title role. She's supported by a top-drawer team of American character actors, led by Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor. On the technical side, the use of black-and-white versus colour is imaginative and interesting. So far, so good. But the script is over-expository, so much so that it felt like a drama-documentary. Perhaps that's what was intended, but if so the makers should have re-assessed their plan in the face of Mol's charm and subtlety, overcoming as she does the plodding dialogue and heavy-footed structuring. There are dead ends galore - the young Bettie's relationship with her father, for example, is glanced at early, as if it were an explanation for or foundation of something, but it's not alluded to again. Why bother to include it in the first place? Never mind. Mol triumphs over these aesthetic adversities.

45,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,nothing shocking here!,7,23 October 2006,"Although it is a phrase that plagues many an entertainment magazine show, few words could better describe the genuine appeal of ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" than Gretchen Mol was born to play Ms. Page, the famous pin-up queen and classic fetishist fave. Her fully realized performance surpasses even her amazing visual likeness to her.Fortunately her Southern charms and sexual allure are enough to propel the film forward, since much of it plays out like the average biopic that often fill up heavily on facts that flatten any chance of finding a story underneath it all. The story here is a simple coming of age tale, commonly seen in various incarnations throughout the years. A young country girl with a dream of stardom finds an alternate route that leads to controversy and scandal. The interesting thing here is how innocent and downright naive Mol's character remains while freely expressing sexuality in a time of great sexual repression.Overall, the film works mainly because of the care that was taken by director Mary Harron and her team to completely sell the era. This is done through the obvious clothing, hair, and music choices, as well as the impressive use of shooting style and editing techniques common during the time period.",The Notorious Bettie Page
46,come2whereimfrom,saint or sinner?,7,22 August 2006,"Everything about 'girl next door' Bettie Page's pictures by today's standards is pretty tame, but in the time when she was modelling they were quite the opposite. Split between black and white and colour with some great splashes of humour the film tells the all but short story of Bettie's modelling career from swim suits, past nude and up to bondage. The real essence of the portrayal captured so well by Gretchen Moll (if Reese can get an Oscar for June Carter then surely Miss. Moll should be eligible for contention) as Bettie is one of innocence and wonder. Brought up as strict Christian and never losing her naivety, the fact that she is so oblivious to what she is doing, seeing her photo shoots as dressing up and ultimately performance, is what made Bettie such an great model and now icon. It is really a story of dreams; after all she wanted to be an actress and acts when she poses giving the shots an air of fun and an almost frivolous nature. It is testament to her and Gretchen's performance that by the tale end of the film you have almost totally forgotten a horrible act that happened near the beginning, and that was Bettie's power, hypnotising you into losing your troubles and just being mesmerised by her. The forest scene where she strips off completely for the first time is almost garden of Eden like and when she professes that 'weren't Adam and Eve naked after all' it is not just her trying to justify what she does in the eyes of her God, but it is that she really believes it. Adored and hated in equal measure in her lifetime and revered now as the mother of everyone from fetishists to suicide girls this is more about what Bettie (if even unwittingly) changed and how peoples perception became altered by a challenge to the normality they were used to. With elements in common with 'The People vs. Larry Flint' but told from the models point of view, the film closes with actual footage of Page dancing so stupidly it amazes you how anyone could have ever found her remotely offencive.

Though it made the biopic more graceful by concentrating on the earlier times, it would have been more complete had it also included her later, troubled times, punctuated with brushes with the law and institutionalization for schizophrenia, as well as being greatly financially troubled due to not getting royalties for her years of photo-work and celebrity.

48,ScottDMenzel,An interesting biopic about the pin up girl Bettie Page and shows how far we have come in terms of sexuality in America.,8,24 April 2006,"""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of America. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. The type of modeling Bettie Page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a U.S Senate investigation in the 1950s.Walking out of the film, all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s. You can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot, that the footage questioned in ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" seems almost childlike and innocent. Most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when Bettie Page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals. I find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography, it was very tastefully done.To be honest, I was pretty impressed with ""The Notorious Bettie Page,"" I found the film to be very well done and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance. I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s.My only complaint about the film was the running time, there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been. I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival. Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page's life where the film left off. Those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid, the acting was great especially Gretchen, and the writing was good.Mary Harron, who directed ""American Psycho"", which is one of my favorite films, is the director and writer of ""The Notorious Bettie Page."" I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like ""Psycho"", Bettie Page is a character study and a fine one at that. Harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director who I hope will be around for many years to come.Bottom Line: ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is definitely worth a look. It's a very interesting story that shows how far America, as well as the world, has come in terms of pornography. The film also provides a fine performance by Gretchen Mol who literally nails the role of Bettie Page on the head. And top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands. Sadly, this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but I think it's worth checking out.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is a 8/10. It's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in American history.",The Notorious Bettie Page

50,moutonbear25,Naughty & Nice,8,31 May 2006,"THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE Written by Mary Harron & Guinevere Turner Directed by Mary HarronHow do you define a person who has always been between two worlds, one of presumed sin and one of supposed redemption? Especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point. If you're director Mary Harron, you don't shy away from showing the push/pull nature of THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE. You allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of God and the church and the seductive illusion of control and dominance afforded to Page during her years as a pinup model. By doing so, audiences are offered a complex character that is propelled forward by a desire to leave her difficult past with a naive enjoyment in others' lust for her and a struggle to reconcile her image in the eyes of God. Come the right time, it will no longer matter how many eyes are on her because there is only one pair that counts.Shot mostly in black and white (with some unnecessary bursts of color), THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is at times a light, humorous comedy, making the film an enjoyable experience and also one that pokes fun at how seriously people believe in the corruption of pornography. But the delicate hand of the director is more palpably felt during Page's times of despair. Harron is a sensitive, considerate director who does not throw Page's numerous and devastating blows of abuse in the face of her viewer. Instead, she allows the surprisingly effective Gretchen Moll, who plays the title role, the chance to hammer the pain of her character into the viewer with fear in her eyes, exhaustion is her cries and shame on her skin. Whereas most directors, perhaps most male directors, would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her, Harron has too much compassion for her character, her actress and her audience. From fragility, Page learns to trust people again and as more and more photographers fall in love with her image, the more she falls in love with their admiration and the control she has over the gaze. By the time her poses cross over into the realm of soft-core S&M, she has found a way to combine her need to be respected with the objectification she has been accustomed to her whole life.Mary Harron's Bettie Page is a woman who yearns for control over her life and destiny, yet ultimately is always being told where to stand, how to smile and what to wear. When she finally realizes that none of her choices have been her own, she chooses to embrace God and preach his word to those who will listen. The true sadness behind this most important decision is that she is still letting someone else guide her blindly; she just has more faith that this direction will be better for her soul.",The Notorious Bettie Page
51,DJJOEINC,Interesting take on the Bettie Page mythology,8,20 May 2007,The Notorious Bettie Page -a not so standard biopic about the 50s pinup queen Bettie Page.Bettie is played perfectly by Gretchen Moll who manages to capture the innocent sexuality of Page's famous pictures.Using a mixture of black and white and color we see snapshots of Bettie's life that lead her to NYC in the early 50s and to her career in front of cameras.She is a charming southern girl who is deeply religious yet not ashamed of her body.She is flattered by the attention she receives at first- but after awhile the infamy and the contradictions and the political climate cause her a lot of discomfort.The DVD has a BTS featurette and a vintage Bettie striptease.A well done look at the model and also the repressive moral climate of the times.Great cinematography and a stellar cast lead to well spent 90 minutes- with plenty of cheesecake.

52,samseescinema,fails when we realize that the film is only repeating itself with slimier and kinkier occurrences,6,17 April 2006,"The Notorious Bettie Page rating: 2 out of 4The entire premise for The Notorious Bettie Page, I'll admit, is a little out of context for me. I'm simply too young for her to have affected my generation. Going in to the film, while other critics chuckled about the dusty Bettie Page mags they still have tucked away in storage somewhere, I didn't even know who Ms. Page was. So maybe the core effect The Notorious Bettie Page is lost on me. But probably not. Director Mary Harron, you see, is locked in a love affair with shock. Her previous filmsparticularly American Psycholive and die mostly through the gasps and wheezes their shock values present. The method works, but sometimes feels paper thin. This time, however, Harron taps an era that was dynamite shock for its time, and dissects it with a thorough hand. This singular shock stretched over 90 minutes is round and dulled and leaves us only with what lies beneath. And as with most Mary Harron films, what lies beneath can easily be discarded. The film, as you'd guess, is the biopic of Pin-Up Girl of the Universe, Bettie Page (Gretchen Mol). We follow Bettie through her adolescence in the South, up until the end of her career as a nudist and infamous fetish model. The ride begins innocently enough, however, with simple bathing suit photography and beach-front posing. But one door leads to another and soon she's strapping on eight-inch stilettos and whipping another girl's bottom. Playing Bettie Page is the luminous Gretchen Mol. Having never seen a Bettie Page photo before, I can't attest to her authenticity in physique; but I certainly can say that Ms. Mol fits the role written for her in the mostly shapely and curvy of manners. And besides her anatomical advantages, Ms. Mol also does well to employ a supreme naivety to her character. Never once was I skeptical of her childish reasoning that went along with the moral ambiguity of her kink-show modeling career. Her version of Bettie Page is the Southern girl written about in love songs: shyly playful, piously Catholic, not without the syrupy Southern drawl, and--here the stereotype wanders--prancing about in the nude or leather fetish wear. But besides Bettie, the rest of Notorious' characters flit about in a fringe existence. Most of them work only to drag Bettie closer to her inevitable damnation, while the rest work to huffily tell her otherwise. Beyond this, they're only faces. This wouldn't be so bad if Bettie Page was engaging enough to carry Notorious. But she's instead a predictably tedious naivety that blushingly agrees to every proposal. Just as long as it makes the boys happy, she says. That's what God would want, she thinks. Just as long as she's making people happy. We all know where this leads. The film doesn't stray far from this downward spiral process Bettie wraps herself into, and fails when we realize that the film is only repeating itself with slimier and kinkier occurrences. On a technical level, Harron lives up to her own notoriety. She hops about between black and white and color, depending on the time period and locale. Miami is vivid with a fuzzily bright palette, while New York slices fedoras with high contrast black and white. The effect is rewarding in that it reminds us of the time period, working to immerse us further into the shock Bettie's creating. But The Notorious Bettie Page is admittedly flaccid when it comes to its shock factor. I'm willing to concede that those of Ms. Page's generation may relapse into the eye-opening astonishment of the fifties, but for those of us unaware of Bettie Page's reign, Mary Harron's film is just another in a long line of mildly engaging biopics.",The Notorious Bettie Page
53,Robert_Hearth,"""The Pin-Up Sensation That Shocked The Nation."" --- Tagline For ""The Notorious Bettie Page""",9,3 December 2006,"""The Notorious Bettie Page"" (2005) Directed By: Mary Harron Starring: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, & David Strathairn MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for nudity, sexual content and some language) It seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are very posh right now. ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is the latest of these to be released on DVD. It features Gretchen Mol as the world's most famous pin-up model, Bettie Page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color. Unlike ""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"", and ""Finding Neverland"", however, this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the Oscars this year. This movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested. This does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie. In fact, ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie--a solid work of cinema. This film focuses more on Page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. It is filmed with fervor and care and Mary Harron's direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about.Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Whether you know her as an iconor a simple porn staryou know her. She is a woman who had a very profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time. Now, most people know her as one of America's first sex symbols--a legend to many models, especially those of Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines. She lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and Page's bondage-style photos were just the thing to push the American public into an uproar. In fact, the photos launched a full-fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn.The performances in ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol standing out. Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant. I understand that, when she was announced for the role, many people were skeptical. Her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when I think of great performances. Now, it will. She completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance. David Strathairn is fresh off of last year's ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", in which he gave one of 2005's best performances. Here, he gives yet another fine performanceeven though he is slightly underused. I was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only performance I have seen from Lili Taylor was that in ""The Haunting"" (1999). While most people ignored the movie, I found it to be an enjoyable, if not completely shallow, horror movie and I also have always thought that Taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally-distraught Nell. Here, Taylor gives yet another credible performance. She gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of Gretchen Mol.After everything was said and done, I realized that ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" cannot be compared to other biopics, such as ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Walk the Line"". It is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career, from the beginning to the end. Her personal life is briefly implied, but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point. We watch the film knowing that Page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will havebut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life. She is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself. After all, she was an adult model turned Christian missionary. This movie does not over dramatize anything. It could have included fictitious moments of Page sobbing hysterically and begging God to forgive her. It could have shown Page running and screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of her pastand yet it does not. ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" tells a simple story and that is something rare by today's standards. Fortunately, it is quite refreshing.Final Thought: ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography.Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",The Notorious Bettie Page

55,Denno1972,Ultimately unsatisfying,5,8 March 2021,"I knew nothing about Bettie Page before watching this but I am always interested by social history and the story is an interesting one. However for me, there was no real depth to this and I struggled really to psee what the film was trying to tell us. It is not in depth enough to get under the skin of Bettie and only fleetingly tells us the legal and social situation beyond the photographs. The acting is good particularly in the case of the actress playing Betty but ultimately this film was disappointing",The Notorious Bettie Page
56,rotildao,It's Mol than Bettier!,8,21 April 2008,"Beautifully shot in b/w added by a wonderful performance by Mol whose smile strip anyone from any self awareness of any definition of the word shame, or hypocrisy. Bettie Page was natural while posing in nude and it was an unconscious slap in the faces of many fake puritans as well as revealing the real public (unfortunately for human kind, saved Pasolini's work) who bought and sold her work as if the core of things were only in the images, instead of our own minds... once again, north Americans avoiding their ""evil"" side to be exposed... anyways... The script is not strong as the material of the story. One funny thing: was David Strathairn using the voice of Edward R. Murrow or it was just a 2005 déjà vu?",The Notorious Bettie Page
57,LeroyBrown-2,More than a typical biography with a great performance by Gretchen Mol,7,3 February 2009,"Bettie Page was an icon of the '50s, she has been called the pin up queen, the bondage queen among others. She was without doubt one of the most photograph women of the decade gracing countless girlie magazines. She would also gain notoriety for appearing in numerous one reel burlesque films as well as bondage films. Whereas there were hundreds of women who did the same things as Bettie, most of them disappeared into obscurity. Miss Page would have a revival of sorts in the 1970's and cement her position as an icon of the 1950's. This movie ""The Notorious Bettie Page"", is a film biography of Miss Page. In many ways it's a typical biography and in some ways it isn't. Had this been made for Lifetime television it would probably portray Bettie as a victim of men. Early in the movie we see this to be somewhat true. We see her being possibly abused by her father, being married young and having to deal with an abusive husband and going on a car trip with a stranger and nothing good happening. Instead of seeing a broken woman though, as would be a case in a Lifetime movie what emerge is a stronger and more confident Bettie. When she finally make it to New York we see her as a woman not afraid to take on new challenges. It's interesting how this movie portrays the porn industry of that era. We don't see mobsters running things, what we see is a more mom and pop business. Yes it's still a low class industry but one that where the participants actually enjoy being with each other. We don't see Bettie get pushed or threatened to do something against her will. As a matter of fact the threats come more from the Authorities, particularly from politicians who want to make a name for themselves. This is where the movie really divert from what could have been just a typical biography. It shows us the attitude towards sex during that era. There's obviously a demand for it but the authorities continue to have a very restrictive attitude. Bettie and her cohorts are threatened with jail time even though what they were doing was basically tame. In the heart of this movie is Gretchen Mol. She gives a magnificent performance. How the Oscars overlooked her I don't know. I have to admit I have had a crush on Miss Mol for a while now and I thought not only did she looked great in this movie she also showed her acting ability. Yes she did a lot of nudity in this film but what's so remarkable is that she was so at ease in front of the camera pretty much what you see with the real Bettie Page. When she spoke, she spoke with a natural southern accent and even her voice sounded different. I couldn't think of a better actress for the role. Gretchen Mol won me over with her looks a long time ago, this time she won me over with her acting.""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is more than your typical film biography, it shows us the inner strength of a woman and the rather unhealthy attitude toward sex of a particular era. On top of that we get a dazzling performance from a beautiful and talented actress.",The Notorious Bettie Page
58,wd-8,Dull.,2,8 December 2008,"What a dull movie! It's completely linear, boring, and confused. The switching between black- and-white and color is gimmicky, and not used consistently. The acting is fine, but the dialog is OHHHHH so dull.The direction and editing are pedestrian at best.Who cooked up this sad little vignette?Gretchen Moll has a terrific body, truly wonderful, but you can get that kind of excitement on any practically any TV channel these days (at least in the UK).What a sad, sad life poor Bettie seems to have had.",The Notorious Bettie Page
59,agostino-dallas,Gretchen Mol embodied Bettie Page like nothing I have ever wacthed before,8,17 January 2018,"I am a movie goer and I go a lot. I have seen many, many people embodying real people on the big screen but nothing like this. The Oscar is little compared to what she did. The movie is also sharply directed and you don't doubt for a second she is Bettie Page. I am a big fun of pin up girls. I can't help it. I see those 50's and 60's housewives and I am like a kid in a candy store. Bettie might have made some stuff who some people could have found inappropriate but it wasn't sure not pervert, not evil, but she was terribly criticized and probably felt so bad about herself. Men took advantage of her, for a change. Does it ring a bell? Gretchen you're great! So is Bettie.",The Notorious Bettie Page
60,rokcomx,"An era when ""pornographers"" faced a fate far worse than jail",8,21 January 2010,"A show well worth peeping. Starring the woman who played lady cop Annie in the U.S. version of the (woefully underrated) Life on Mars TV show, the Notorious Bettie Page is a pretty good movie. It goes into surprising depth RE the increasingly federalized attempts to legislate all aspects of the sex biz out of existence, as well as covering a lot of Miss Page's (very interesting) personal biographical history. Star Gretchen Mol (who seems to specialize in period pieces - the '70s in Life on Mars, and now the '50s) does well with projecting both innocence and naughtiness. I've met part-time pornographer Bunny Yeager and can vouch that the movie's portrayal is fairly accurate, if a bit superficial - much more could have been done with the motivations behind choosing such an ""outlaw"" endeavor, in a social-status era when jail wasn't anywhere near the worst thing that could result.All in all, tho, a well-done flick --",The Notorious Bettie Page
61,kingbad,Fairly shallow biopic,5,16 September 2005,"Saw this at the Toronto film festival (popular movie, as it was directed by a Canadian). I was disappointed at how it chose to skim over it's main character's motivation in making the controversial fetish and bondage photos and movies that led to her notoriety. It simply wasn't believable that Bettie Page was so galactically stupid that she wasn't aware that her work was targeted toward sexual gratification of fetishists, but was simply ""dressing up in costumes and having fun"". Her constant surprise at being objectified by weirdos really struck a false note with me; also, her intense religious upbringing and mental instability were glossed over or ignored. Gretchen Mol certainly looked the part; however, it doesn't really take a good actress to portray a bad actress.",The Notorious Bettie Page
62,maatmouse-1,The Queen of Pin Up in a delightful movie about her career,8,20 September 2006,"Firstly, I have heard great things about this film, not least among the retro/vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love Bettie Page and it did not disappoint. Shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes, the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of Bettie Page.There are many things I did not know about Page. Firstly, there was the gang rape, later on, there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then glamour pictures, firstly with a camera club peopled with men who can't get enough of her and later with the Klaws, Paula and Irving, who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos, come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people. If only modern pornography producers were like that, perhaps better porn would be a consequence! For the most part, the film is neither a diatribe against the evils of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women. This environment was extremely repressive, perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the 'saturation' effect that we have today, when it comes to pornography. It also appeared to be much less harsh. Page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and doesn't appear to be degraded by it. In many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged (and trying to hold a conversation), brandishing a whip with a flourish, thus exciting the photographers taking her pictures and seen in 'initiation style' girlie bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now.Page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirties for 'Jesus Christ'. Her belief in God and Jesus never goes away, even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been given a 'gift' by God to do 'this thing'. Seeing this film, I am more knowledgeable about Page and in awe at her modesty, beliefs and demeanour. She is one of a kind, compared with the identi-kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can actually say 'There is life after porn'.",The Notorious Bettie Page

My description of this movie is about as deep as the plot.",The Notorious Bettie Page
64,zken,Betty Page why were you the rage?,6,16 April 2006,"I liked this movie because it recreates a time that we can all be nostalgic for-when sex was considered more dangerous than drugs! The film is just as much about the 50's as about Betty. But unfortunately, the film just doesn't hit the theme hard enough. The effect of society's own restrictions on sexual imagery was to create a sensational allure out of what now appears to be quite innocent material. This governmental and religious attitude (where was the Catholic church in this film?) really propelled Hugh Hefner to millions, and literally created the dominance of the porno industry over the Internet. None of these effects are necessarily a good thing in my mind. We now are deluged by porn like there is no tomorrow. The film really missed a chance to tie some of these consequences together. That would have made Betty Page somewhat of a darker character than the film assumes. Why isn't the sex industry debated in this movie? Why aren't these issues talked about in society today? Why is it we accept the fact that America's biggest industrial companies now invest in perversity like it is oil fields? All of this is controversial stuff that the film could have grabbed a hold of. To bad it didn't. It would have made sense if the title really had meant something. Otherwise, seeing the 50's recreated with such charm and seeing the beautiful Ms. Moll are certainly worth the price of admission to this male viewer.",The Notorious Bettie Page
65,asdodge,A poor attempt at a great story and legend,3,21 July 2008,"Sadly, Marry Harron decided to do a fictional account of Bettie Page's life to go along with her own issues with men. As typical in all her work, every major male character is portrayed as weak, bumbling, or twisted. To add to her fiction, she projects ideas and issues that are not true, according to Bettie Page herself. Bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues (though she became a born-again later in life, through the influence of her 3rd husband- a minister). She left it, because she was in her late 30's, her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks. The hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in Bettie's own words and are the director's attempts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots (not handed to her by ""sick"" fetishists). Harron also fails to make a point that Bunny Yeager, who did many famous photo shoots of Bettie, also did many ""naughty"" shoots with Bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film.The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it.",The Notorious Bettie Page
66,MorpheusOne,Not as thorough a biopic as I had hoped.,10,18 October 2021,"I refuse to believe that no one else has noticed this - but, I haven't come across anyone else, so far, who has. Around the time when Bettie Page was becoming known for this kind of photography, DC Comics was publishing Wonder Woman, a comic book about a strong female lead hero who was, & still is, that title character. That character, in the comic, would regularly use the 'Lasso of Truth' to subdue villains, tying them up &, due to its special 'truth serum'-like powers, as they were tied up they were forced to speak the truth about whatever they were asked, specifically by Wonder Woman. This was bondage and sado-masochism! I know that DC Comics, especially of the 1950's, would never have gone for it; but, Bettie Page would have made an excellent Wonder Woman... Especially, this type of Wonder Woman!The best thing about this biopic is Gretchen Moll, hands down. Based on everything that I know about Bettie Page, including what she looked like, her behavior towards other people in general, the anxiousness that she experienced about the kind of photography that she became known for, etc., it's obvious that Gretchen Moll portrayed Bettie Page better than anyone else could have; & not just around the time when this film was made - perhaps ever. The film does not go into enough detail, however, about what happened to Bettie Page after she stepped away from this career. The film does nothing to explore her crash & burn run-in with a landlord that culminated in, supposedly, stabbing three people and Bettie Page being declared mentally unfit to stand trial, her being diagnosed with schizophrenia & ultimately her institutionalization. So, & obviously, the film does not bother to cover her eventual release from institutionalization, nor her retirement. It also does not cover her reaction to her popularity, which she did not know about until after her release back into society. Her popularity surged in the 80's & 90's with the dawn of the modern internet & the abandonment of some aspects of social conservatism; such as the ''Comics Code Authority''...that which was first inflicted upon America, & the comic book industry specifically, during the 1950's & its neo-fascist McCarthyism. It is interesting, too, to recognize that the abandonment of that social conservatism actually began in the early 60's when magazines began publishing content that was actually far, FAR, far racier than anything that Bettie Page herself was ever a part of. (An interesting aspect of the history of publishing touched on at the end of this film.) So, very much so, that by the time Bettie Page was a 'Buy-Bull' thumper such content was common place.Seriously! ...another forty-five minutes could have been added to this film and it would have been a much better film if they had done so!I thought it was odd to see David Strathairn as the senior Congressional representative pushing a Congressional investigation in this film. Around the same time that this film was released he was in 'Good Night & Good Luck', a much better film, as Edward R. Murrow, a role obviously much more suited to his talent as an actor. That role is the absolute antithesis of this one.",The Notorious Bettie Page
67,strain6,Disappointing Given the Subject Matter,5,29 August 2006,"Agatha Christie complained that authors adapting her work for the stage were not cutting out enough. That may be the case here. The film shows us scenes from a life from childhood to a the main character's conversion to Chrisianity. We get no deeper understanding of any phase of her life or anything but a superficial insight into her. In the attempt to show us everything, we see nothing. There were three cliché episodes: a child possibly subbing for mom, a rape, an abusive husband. Was that supposed to explain the choices which made Betty Page notorious? I hope not. It was as if the film-maker couldn't get a handle on the subject or the story. On the plus side were the actors. There were just too many of them.",The Notorious Bettie Page

While the surface of The Notorious Bettie Page is certainly slick and visually engaging, there just seems to be nothing beneath that surface. For all the meticulous recreation of the fifties period, the impression I had was of people ""just dressing up in costumes,"" but never portraying the characters beneath. Considering she is given little to work with in terms of character motivation, Gretchen Mol does a decent job. As to the other actors, it's a bad sign when the process of acting becomes so evident that one is more aware of the actor than the character. Disappointing.",The Notorious Bettie Page
69,thorr97,A Good Snapshot of a Pin-Up Queen,8,4 May 2006,"I've known about Bettie Page for many a year now. The soft-core porn images of her from the 1950's have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today. The ""Bettie Page"" look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then. So I watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with. The result did not disappoint.Among other things, it was hugely entertaining to see the movie's recreation of actual figures like Irving Klaw, John Willie, and Bunny Yeager  all consider trailblazers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual repression and hypocrisy in 1950's America along with a sexuality that, by today's standards, was innocent in the extreme. I particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate Bettie found herself in.I think that Gretchen Mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of Bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter naiveté. Bettie loved to look pretty, loved the attention, saw nothing wrong with nudity, and enjoyed dressing up in ""silly outfits"" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her. To this day she still doesn't understand ""what all the fuss was about"" when it comes to her pictures or the S&M content of them.This isn't to say she's uneducated or too simple to understand it's just that she simply doesn't ""get it"" about fetishism and never will. No harm there. Bettie Page is simply being who she is. The film captured this quite nicely.The social atmosphere of the 1950's depicted by Ms. Harron and written by her along with Guinevere Turner makes me truly glad I live in the day and age that I do. The hypocrisy and repression combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a frighteningly stifling world. The film well captures this and brings to cheering as Bettie endures it all with her unshakeable faith and her unchangeable naiveté.This film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points Ms. Harron attempted and hit them well. I'd recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what effect she had on American culture. For those with such interests, then this film is a must see.",The Notorious Bettie Page
70,adrian_stranik,The resurrection bop,4,9 April 2008,"On the 26th of September 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of Leonie Haddad, a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly. Haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had, in fact, come fresh from The Patton State Mental Hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously. Haddad soon realised that something was 'rotten in Denmark' when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about' seven Gods'. Haddad's fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that ""God has inspired me to kill you"". Haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest. It was a miracle she survived. The lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent, kicking and screaming, back to the laughing academy. Ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity; but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims, but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the 'Queen of the Curve's, the 'Tennessee Tease' and 'Miss Pin Up Girl of the World' - the Notorious Bettie Page. Director Mary Harron, mainly known for 'American Psycho' takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model (played solidly enough by Gretchen Mol) who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks. T.N.B.P is day-glo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950's where Page, with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers, becomes the number one star of pocket sized men's glossies with titles like Wink, Tab and Parade. Her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to God. The overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her father's incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her. Mol plays Page as she seems in her photographs, happy, carefree and fun - even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility. The film ends on the upbeat with Page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages, personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her; avoiding what I think is the essential core of Page's story - rebirth and resurrection. Having emerged from a decade of incarceration Page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980's and that she had become a huge underground icon, during which, many were asking ""whatever happened to Bettie Page"". Her 'mysterious' disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend. When the world's media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines, T.V and being photographed at Playboy parties with the likes of Pamela Anderson and the equally tragic Anna Nicole Smith. She found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her 'glory years' but in the glare of this 'resurrection' it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light. The only notorious thing about The Notorious Bettie Page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious.",The Notorious Bettie Page

The other actors are also very good and congratulations to the casting department who did IMO an excellent job for this movie.

Very good movie, excellent acting by Gretchen Mol and her co-actors. Beware of some full female nudity in this movie. However, this movie never comes even close to porn, according todays standards.

73,bill-987,She's not Michael Jordan,8,22 June 2008,"She's not Michael JordanThink of all the marvelous NBA players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth. Their names might trip as easily off the public's lips as Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume gets turned down a little, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to Michael.I've seen it written that Gretchen Mol's career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 Vanity Fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for Ms. Mol. It was later said that she had been over hyped. I disagree.I still remember that for some time after I saw ""The Devil's Advocate"" in '97 or '98, I would get confused as to which actress played Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mol or Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was the one in ""2 Days in the Valley"" and ""Mighty Joe Young"" and Gretchen Mol was in ""Donnie Brasco"", ""Celebrity"", and ""Rounders"".By the time I had seen ""The Thirteenth Floor"" (Mol) and ""Sweet November"" (Theron), I pretty much had them straightened out but I still put them in the same mental file drawer. Both were highly talented, had sweet faces, similar body types, short blonde hair and so on.Theron, though, was offered more work. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating.In 2003 ""Monster"" was released and from that point until the handing of the Oscar itself, all of filmdom knew who the ""Best Actress"" award was going to. And deservedly so! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real Aileen Wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in Selby's head. And for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive! Unheard of!Then in 2005 ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" was released. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Ms. Theron. It was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing Presidential candidate, nobody came and nobody cared. It was viewed as a continuation of an old tale, once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a ""B"" movie. Ho hum! No, no, no! Wrong! No matter what you may think of the film (and I enjoy films about the fifties) if you pass on this one you'll be missing one of the better performances of that year. Ms. Moll was every bit as much Bettie as Ms. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately Aileen, to the film-going public, is the more sympathetic character. For whatever reason, an amoral, sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a naïve, unsophisticated, uninhibited, religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. Her photos and films never sexual, never pornographic, but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky. There was no sense of realism, only parody. Ms. Moll captured the very essence of the character. She gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film, her body was Bettie's. Her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about Bettie. Cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality. In this film it's all about innocence. Seeing Gretchen/Bettie nude didn't make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. If you pass on this film you'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, shame on the MPAA for giving this an R rating.",The Notorious Bettie Page
74,mellowinman,Really Nice,10,24 August 2009,"I was so happy with this picture. Gretchen Mol is just drop-dead gorgeous. The photography is beautiful. It's a nice, pleasing portrait of a bondage queen; very appealing to the eyes and ears. It's not an earth-shattering portrayal. It doesn't delve deep into Bettie's psyche. And why would it? This woman, this character or actress; I don't know, whether it's Gretchen or Bettie I'm seeing, she just wowed me. It was such and enjoyable experience to see her charisma and charm, unpretentiously shining through while she played sex kitten. And of course, she has an incredible body and smile.All I can say about this film is ""wow!"" I guess it's not for everyone, but I don't have anything bad to say about it. For those smug jerks who wanted some deep portrayal of the life of a pin-up queen, I say, ""shame on you."" Maybe these fools should just enjoy good acting, great cinematography and some really great breasts.I did.",The Notorious Bettie Page
75,bjorkpluto,The movie wasn't deep enough: SPOILERS,6,15 May 2006,"I give this movie a 6 out of 10. I thought that Gretchen Mol was a good choice for Page and she played her well. However, I don't like how Mary Haron and Guinevere Turner made Page out to be an idiot. I find it hard to believe Page was so incredibly naive. Page seemed oblivious to ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. The movie in the beginning alludes to Betty getting raped by her father as a child. However, I think the writers did not peel beneath the surface enough. Then they show Betty about to get gang raped. Again, not saying we needed to see the rape. However, we NEEDED to know how Betty felt a about that traumatic EXPERIENCE. This is my complaint there wasn't e enough TRUTH shown in the film. And the scene with the black photographer was he Betty's lover? Who was he? The movie didn't SHOW ME ENOUGH. I want to SEE the movie and I felt like I was being TOLD. The movie seemed to PUSH the image and message that Betty Page is a nice sweet Southern Girl that got into taking nude photos/pornography and making S&M films. We know Page is not a bad person. However, the filmmakers seemed too TIMID to me, they held back and that HURT THE FILM.",The Notorious Bettie Page
76,pb104-1,"Well-made biopic, but a little thin",7,17 January 2006,"Bettie Page was a icon of the repressed 1950s, when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body. Her acting career went nowhere, but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field. Photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in New York, this made-for-TV (HBO) film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast. The problem is, it's emotionally rather flat. It's difficult to form an attachment to the character, since Bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in. The self-serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time, which slows down the film towards the end. But it's definitely worth watching for the history of the time, and to see the heavy-handed government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties. 7/10",The Notorious Bettie Page
77,IAmMrDexB,Sexy yet fluffy,6,17 August 2016,"Pretty interesting dive into the life and career of Bettie Page. Even though I'm gay myself, I think she is one of my favourite people from the 50s, and I am just as saddened that she has had mental health issues in the past, if not famous for memory, but not now. But religion overshadows any mental health issues in this film. Of course, I understand that she was born again, and I'll admit there are lots of films that focus more on other people's mental health that would be more helpful, (this film does focus on the photo shoots and the controversy surrounding her S&M films) but you CANNOT just end a film without her fame haunting her afterwards. I think it should be impossible to ignore completely, even if brief, but surprisingly, this HBO film doesn't seem to have any acknowledgement of what happened or even the state of her at the time. Somehow charming and sexy in showcasing her beauty and the range of the work she was in, but way way too fluffy to appreciate as a successful adaptation. Deary me!",The Notorious Bettie Page
78,tomhbrand,The Notorious Bettie Page,4,13 November 2006,"When setting out this film, director Mary Harron seemingly had the goal of clearly documenting the progress of Bettie Page's career, from early modelling days to leaving modelling to go back home after the Senate Hearings on Juvenile Delinquency and her religious rediscovery in the 50s, and so intent is she to get all of these facts on screen in the time allowed she seems to have missed out on taking any time to explain anything in depth.When you think of someone who had Page's career you'd think that there would be plenty to discuss, her reasons, decisions, life event, personal traumas, but Harron avoids any kind of personal exploration of the character. In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse, domestic violence and a gang rape, but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again. You get the impression that Harron and Guinevere Turner (co-writer) wanted to gloss over anything that wasn't glamorous and flattering. You go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was, but all you are given is a list of things that she did and recreations of some of her most famous photo shoots.All in all the film really frustrates you as you watch, desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself. How did she balance her religion with her job? What made this young Tennessee girl move from modelling into bondage photography. The film simply shows her going to another modelling agency and putting on whatever she's told, but surely it would have involved some shock and deliberation, this was after all the 50s.It seems to me that Harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by today's standards (Page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions) and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous And although this is true, she never actually makes it seem sordid in the eyes of others. Today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it, but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience. This woman was a central part of a Senate hearing on Juvenile Delinquency, but no one is ever really shown as shocked.Basically I left this film just thinking how tame it was. Harron and Turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer. They come across as two lifelong fans of Miss Page and are desperate to make sure that nothing, absolutely nothing, could possibly put a bad light on their heroine, and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was. (Before and after her career there are reports of her violent nature and mental problems) And all that's left is the string of events that made up her career, without any substance whatsoever behind it.",The Notorious Bettie Page
79,europolismovie,Gory Days,6,7 June 2007,"On the 26th of September 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of Leonie Haddad, a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly. Haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had, in fact, come fresh from The Patton State Mental Hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously. Haddad soon realised that something was 'rotten in Denmark' when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about' seven Gods'. Haddad's fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that ""God has inspired me to kill you"". Haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest. It was a miracle she survived. The lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent, kicking and screaming, back to the laughing academy. Ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity; but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims, but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the 'Queen of the Curve's, the 'Tennessee Tease' and 'Miss Pin Up Girl of the World'  the Notorious Bettie Page. Director Mary Harron, mainly known for 'American Psycho' takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model (played solidly enough by Gretchen Mol) who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks. T.N.B.P is day-glo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the1950's where Page, with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers, becomes the number one star of pocket sized men's glossies with titles like Wink, Tab and Parade. Her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to God. The overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her father's incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her. Mol plays Page as she seems in her photographs, happy, carefree and fun - even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility. The film ends on the upbeat with Page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages, personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her; avoiding what I think is the essential core of Page's story - rebirth and resurrection. Having emerged from a decade of incarceration Page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980's and that she had become a huge underground icon, during which, many were asking ""whatever happened to Bettie Page"". Her 'mysterious' disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend. When the world's media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines, T.V and being photographed at Playboy parties with the likes of Pamela Anderson and the equally tragic Anna Nicole Smith. She found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her 'glory years' but in the glare of this 'resurrection' it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light.The only notorious thing about The Notorious Bettie Page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious.",The Notorious Bettie Page

Nothing outside of superficial attempts to explore any real themes. So the fifties were a very uptight, sexually repressed era? Been done a thousand times in much more thought-provoking ways than this. And for the character of Betty? What about the fact that she was a fairly smart lady just barely missed going to college? What of her aspiring career as an actress that never panned out? What of breaking boundaries in a society where women had very few options and dealing with notoriety as a result? Interesting angles that the film only lightly touches on.",The Notorious Bettie Page

Mistreated by men all her life, yet unable to recognise that the pictures she willingly poses for are for the innocent entertainment of 'classy' gentlemen.It is a film that doesn't seem to know whether it is a banner for free speech and expression, or a diatribe about the nature of sin.

82,Lautremont,Surprisingly and pleasantly sweet and delightful,9,5 April 2006,"Beautifully made with a wonderful performance from Gretchen Moll capturing such a stainless plain happiness in her work, and the recreations of the little movies and the photographs are perfectly made and often hilarious. According to Harron they used film stock that is no longer produced and fifties style studio lighting even for the outside locations to give the colour portions its distinctive look. Bettie Page saw the movie at Hugh Heffner's house (she is now eighty-three) with the producers there, but not the director, in case it got awkward if she didn't like it. She apparently did like it up until the official inquiry, which she found unsettling. Some great costumes too. The idea for the movie started in 1993, but this was worth the wait. The portrait of her never seems to ring false in reference to all those images and snippets of (dreadful) movies that many of us will have already seen. It would make an interesting companion piece with Goodnight and Goodluck, but much more pleasant viewing!",The Notorious Bettie Page
83,ericjhanvey,Can't believe the rating this film has,4,18 February 2013,"I watched this on TV the other night and was really disappointed with it. For me it completely lacked any narrative whatsoever or was it only narrative and no substance. Each scene seemed to be written with the sole purpose of getting to the next one. There was no depth to the characterisation of any of the key figures and I felt that I knew no more about Bettie Page at the end of the film than I did at the beginning. In particular the film seemed to just skirt over her relationships with men, some of which seemed to have lasted for quite considerable lengths of time. This is not a criticism of the actors but the dialogue they were given.On a more positive note Gretchen Mol has IMHO the finest breasts on the planet and we do get to see a fair bit of them.",The Notorious Bettie Page
84,MorrisZapp,Fantastic presentation of Bettie and her times,8,1 November 2006,"This is a great portrayal of the era that the Bettie Page phenomenon came out of, and an honest, non-sensationalized presentation of her story. That's what people are calling a ""thin plot""...too much of the boring existence of real life for them, I guess.They did a fabulous job presenting the smut industry of that era. In today's porn industry, nobody has any pretensions of it being anything but serving a product to satisfy lust. Back then, people knew they were crossing a line of decency, but their mindset was still artistic, or at least they wanted to believe that.So the people who made these magazines, at least the ones Bettie posed for, seem to have been rather nice chaps, mostly. It helps explain why Bettie's pictures always show her to be so genuinely happy and playful; they were making her comfortable and just asking her to be herself. Gretchen Moll captures that eerily well, and she also perfects Bettie's goofy, minced attempts at erotic dancing. I would venture to say that the future will find it hard to separate these recreations from the original surviving footage.The one question I have at this point, is where did the biographical information come from? Isn't the real-life Bettie, supposedly alive and well, reclusive and unwilling to comment on her past? Early in the film they are bold enough to suggest that her father may have molester her as a girl, and that she was gang-raped as a young woman. That gang-rape scene seems to be setting the stage as a life-changing incident, but the story doesn't use it whatsoever...Bettie continues to be friendly and receptive to men's advances as though she's never had any bad experience in her life.One last thing, the Special Features on the DVD contains a real Bettie Page reel from the past. (Is it really? I don't think it is Gretchen Moll's body. They really digitally scrubbed it to raise the production values.) They really found a gem from the past...a scene of Bettie in street clothes undressing in an ordinary small bedroom, shot intimately with a close camera. It goes beyond straight cheesecake because Bettie made a mood study out of it...her face has loneliness and regret on it, which could have been real, but comes off as a great performance.",The Notorious Bettie Page
85,mhusher,The Truth About Sex in America,8,28 September 2005,"Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America, an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner, are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Bettie's life were all the film was concerned about, then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, she accomplishes this goal admirably, holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own ""enlightened"" 21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography.

86,breakingmadkaty,Absolutely amazing movie!,10,12 February 2010,"Now some people when they look at a movie like this might be, this is just sex. The truth is, it is so much more than that. Does it happen to contain nudity? And is the main character a sex symbol? Yes and yes. However, give it a chance, and you'll notice that it is indeed sexy but it's also moving and powerful and way more than porn; i.e: boobs. Gretchen Mol is fantastic as Bettie Page, I can not imagine any other woman portraying the role. And making it clear that this movie is meant for the story of the woman, and not the story of her body, is the fact for the first half hour or so, there isn't even any nudity. Instead the movie is about the life of a symbol and trend setter, Bettie Page. My only complaint with this wonderful movie is it's length, it doesn't dive deep enough, however so many movies telling true stories about people are overly long and in that sense it's massively refreshing to learn about someone in a shorter amount of time and being entertained throughout. Great movie. Rent it or buy it, I'd heavily recommend purchasing it though, this is one you'll definitely want in your collection.

While it does cover the majority of Bettie's young life, it also manages to stay on a mostly focused path which is something most biographical films seem to lack. There is some lovely and alarmingly funny subtext in the dialogue and acting. This film is an excellent break from the Dir. of ""American Psycho,"" and I think this will show through as her best work to date. Oh, and as a cinematography buff, I give this film 100% in the cine dept. It was amazing how well they pulled off a 50s look with modern film stocks. Accolades to the D.O.P.

88,gflip-2,Excellent but tame look at Bettie Page,8,29 November 2006,"Moll is absolutely perfect as Page, and her story is told in a very respectful, dignified way. The Klaw story, as a subplot, is also well done. The main thing missing, as others have noted, is something about what happened to Page after she left the modeling career and found Jesus (again?). Other than that, the direction and acting, in my opinion, were outstanding. *SPOILERS* Something misunderstood by some who have only seen this movie and not Page's actual work, is the work with Klaw. The movie recreates some of the Klaw film scenes using Moll and other modern actresses, in an attempt to convey what she was up to with him. For some reason Harron drastically toned down the intensity of those scenes (buy the actual films to compare), I suppose taming them for general audiences. What you wind up with here are fun, silly, goofy bondage scenes. In reality, the scenes were extremely intense, serious, and tough. I'm not knocking Klaw's work -- it's pure genius. I suppose Harron thought we couldn't handle it, but it does diminish the film. Page's work with Klaw, while not all fun and games to produce, was harmless to us adults,and in my opinion barely pornography. The government's persecution of Klaw was misguided and mean, and we probably lost a lot of his genius work because of it. Nonetheless, don't imagine the girls were having a good time when they made the films -- they got paid to be uncomfortable.",The Notorious Bettie Page

90,scarbiedoll,Bettie fans (and Mary Harron fans) won't be disappointed,10,17 September 2005,"More a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged out biopic, this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie-type film. I think the tendency would be to portray Bettie Page as some sort of sex vixen, like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you've truly looked carefully at Bettie's poses, she always looked happy. Not a ""you wish you could get with me"" haughty look, nor the ""I'm just doing this because my acting career didn't work out"" look of a porn star. And so, the ladies involved with this film (three female producers, a female writer/ director, female co-writer and the lovely Gretchen Mol, who I'm sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence) really captured the idea of a sweet, somewhat naive, southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol' JC wouldn't be too upset with her. Gretchen Mol turns out a career high performance (she may just have the most perfect breasts ever), which I am happy about, because she did have the curse. Several years ago, she made the cover of Vanity Fair when no one really knew who she was, touting her as the next It-girl. And let's be frank, that was a bit presumptuous. I mean unfortunately she has never made it to Gwyneth status, though not for lack of talent. Making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in fickle Hollywood renders you forgettable I'm afraid. If this doesn't put her back on the A-list, well I'll be a monkey's uncle.Intensely private, Bettie herself has not seen the film yet. Bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever floats your boat honey. You were one helluva woman.

The story of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the South who's momma wouldn't let her date until she married, who moved to New York and ended up becoming the most successful pin-up of her age, is driven by an outstanding performance from Gretchen Moll. Her Page can't quite reconcile the pictures that she takes (nobody's allowed to touch, it's all fun and respectful) with the pornography trials and supposed ill-effects that her images have on the world around her.Page has been an inspiration to every burlesque artist since, not just because she had a figure to die for, but because she invested every picture with an innocent sense of fun that was uniquely sexy and simple at the same time.

92,m-theknife,A Brilliant and Innocent Test of the Current Legal Climate,8,9 April 2006,"First, let me say that Notorious is an absolutely charming film, very lovingly rendered of its time and subject(s). Gretchen Mol is utterly, painfully convincing, the very soul of the contradictions smoothly reified by Ms. Page herself. Irving and Paula Klaw are richly drawn as the working-class stiffs they were (having met Paula at Movie Star News in 1990 I can say that Lili Taylor's performance is unimpeachable), and Jared Harris as John Willie (Coutts) is an adoringly debauched genius. Anyone with an interest in the recorded history of American attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie, in a theater preferably, where votes made with dollars count more.Second, I will allow that I am a producer of material similar to that for which the Klaws would become famous, which is no way affects my estimation of Ms. Harron's work as the splendid piece that it is, but does condition my view of Notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order. Ms. Harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion. Along with V for Vendetta, it is a movie about another time for our times.Few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in Notorious (through transcription of the very words uttered in closed Senate committee hearings) is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now. While Ms. Harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film, her faithfulness to the facts, and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them, synchronizes Notorious with the present day. The very acts that Notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the Communications Decency Act, recently brought to the Supreme Court as a First Amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the Bush administration. In other words, the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in Notorious is indictable today by Federal prosecutors in whatever (hostile) jurisdiction they choose. Of course, there were no hearings in the Senate or elsewhere on this matter when the CDA was passed. Of course you know nothing about it, because you don't want people in Peoria telling you what you can and cannot look at (likewise, people in Peoria probably don't want me telling them what they're allowed to view). Of course Notorious will never be indicted. It's Hollywood. It's lawyered up. Countless Klaws will, however, continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic, moral or biological composition much in 50+ years.In addition, Notorious posts no 18 USC 2257 compliance statement, which is mandated by the unnoticed ""earmark"" recently voted into law. If any media contains images of ""sadomasochistic restraint"" it is required to make available (ex warrant) records of age and circumstance of all performers. Notorious fails in this regard also.In addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an (nearly) accurate historical document, Notorious will be the litmus against which the Bush Justice Department is itself judged with respect to the 14th (Equal Protection) Amendment and on perhaps several other Constitutional grounds. In this regard alone, a debt of gratitude is owed Mary Harron. You'll be grateful in any case, Constitutional or otherwise, if you see this film.",The Notorious Bettie Page
93,donandlisanyc,Nororious or safe?,10,16 April 2006,"If this film strikes you (as it did us and, apparently, others departing the theater) as disappointingly thin, it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing. The film faithfully presents us Bettie Page as she probably was: a playful almost-innocent from the rural South whose career as ""the pinup queen of the universe"" was for her just goofy, natural fun. Her eventual moral qualms, religious conversion and sudden departure from nude and bondage modeling are biographically accurate, yet hard to understand given how untroubled she seemed by her livelihood.There are many reasons to see this film even so, not least of which are the amazing b&w noir cinematography of W. Mott Hopfel III (complete with old fashioned wipes and dissolves), the 1950's-faithful acting of the cast under the direction of Mary Harron, pitch-perfect performances by some of our most underrated supporting actors (including Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak), not to mention the Oscar-worthy and technically difficult lead performance of Gretchen Mol.Ms. Mol does several scenes fully naked and most others in amazing period lingerie and ""specialty"" costumes (gloriously assembled by costume designer John A. Dunn), yet she astonishingly maintains Bettie Page's unstudied pleasure in her lush body. To watch Ms. Mol as Ms. Page, an aspiring actress, progressing through degrees of progressively less ""bad"" auditions and student acting scenes is to see a truly fine actress in complete control of her craft.The script does effectively bring us into 1950's America, where childhood sexual abuse, lawless abduction and rape, and the legal suppression of brands of pornography which today seem laughably tame, is a reality. 50's New York is evoked with seamlessly-inter cut news reel footage. 50's Miami comes alive in super-saturated, 16mm-style color. The real Bettie Page seems to scamper, smile and pose before us, and yet the effect is curiously lightweight, barely lewd and not at all dangerous.How odd that bondage's greatest icon should be so lacking in venom, and that this technically excellent biopic should have so little sting.",The Notorious Bettie Page
94,imjdg1,OK Film,6,18 November 2006,"A story about a pornographer and a ""dirty books"" model. Although tame compared to the sleaze of today, the short films Bettie Page starred in were considered quite dirty in the 1950's. So immoral in fact, that Bettie and the pornographer, Irving Klaw, were pursued by the FBI. The maker of this film, unfortunately, imposes his own moral outlook on those days. The result is that this film is not an accurate portrayal of those times. It seems to be more of an apology for the current time's morality, or lack thereof. The very title of this film makes no sense. Bettie Page was in no way ""notorious"" in her day. Actually, she was barely known, except by the raincoat crowd of Times Square. And she is certainly not ""notorious"" in the present, being lionized to her great puzzlement. Bettie Page renounced her participation in this type of activity, and sought a quiet life away from the camera. She lived peacefully with her new found faith, until ""rediscovered"" by modern aficionados. Still, the film does contain many well shot scenes, and the acting is decent.",The Notorious Bettie Page
95,melody216-1,"So, who exactly is Ms. Page anyway?",3,11 July 2007,"Who is Bettie Page? I certainly didn't find out while watching this movie. From what I have gathered from other sources, Ms. Page was highly in demand in the post-world war II period as the queen of ""naughty"" pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts. I never did get to know Bettie, the woman, though. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at. The film glosses over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film, the ""naughty"" pictures. Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of Bettie in her pointy bras, Bettie in her girdle and stockings, Bettie in bondage...etc. The movie slides from black and white to color every time Ms. Page visits Miami Beach. Then back to her shades of gray life in New York we go. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet. When Bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her High School valedictorian by getting an A- rather than an A one can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms. Page's ""naughty"" photos seem in 2007. It is truly sad that seeing a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit wouldn't even get a hit on My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds. I would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd undergarments.",The Notorious Bettie Page

97,dlb91,An insightful look at not only a sex icon but sex itself in 1950's New York,8,7 May 2007,"From film maker Mary Harron, who brought use such films as I shot Andy Warhol and American Psycho, comes the story of Bettie Page, a highly successful 1950's pin-up model, one of the first sex icons in America, and the target of a Senate investigation (based on her bondage photos). This magnificent film tells Pages amazing yet slightly accidental fall into celebrity during 1950's New York as she pursues a career in glamour modelling but as she grows in popularity she begins to delve deeper into the modelling worlds pornographic and bondage scene while still maintaining her faith in God and not seeing any reason why people would have a problem with her choosing to expose her body.Pages story reveals her amazing faith and courage as a woman completely in touch and comfortable with her sexuality and body at a time when sex was a strictly taboo subject and she is fantastically portrayed but Gretchen Mol, whom i personally believe was completely over looked by the Academy and rightful deserved an Oscar nomination for her remarkable portrayal. Harron also directs amazing life into this production and an ensemble cast of actors also gives this biopic its unmissable sense of beauty about a woman whom was loved by many and shall be remembered for ever.",The Notorious Bettie Page
