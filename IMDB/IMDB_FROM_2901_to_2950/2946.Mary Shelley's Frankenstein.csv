0,TheLittleSongbird,"Well designed and well intentioned, but there is something missing...",7,25 July 2009,"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein certainly isn't a terrible film, far from it. In fact, it is a very good one, with some genuinely disturbing moments. I never did like the part when the monster tears out Elizabeth's heart, or any of the two hanging scenes, they disturbed me so much. I also felt there was something missing-Kenneth Branagh assures there is plenty of character development, and attention to detail,which is much appreciated, but sadly the film is a little soulless, and its cumbersome length probably doesn't help. Despite all this, there is much to be praised. The film is well designed, with splendid period detail with a superb score from Patrick Doyle, and benefits also from being fairly faithful to the source material. Kenneth Branagh does a good job directing, and delivers a fine performance as Victor Frankenstein, and Helena Bonham Carter looks beautiful as Elizabeth. Out of the more secondary roles, Tom Hulce is good as Henri Cleval, and Richard Briers gives a believable turn in the role of Felix. The best actor though in the movie, is Robert DeNiro as the monster- while his performance was genuinely terrifying at times, there are others when you feel sorry for him. Overall, a good film, undermined by lack of depth, but the detail and the performances salvage it from sinking into disaster. 7/10 Bethany Cox.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
1,Leofwine_draca,"Sufficiently literary in feel, but it still changes too much from the novel",6,29 August 2016,"Be Warnedthat spoilers lie herein. Branagh's popular spin on the classic work of Gothic literature may stick fairly close to the origins of the story (certainly closer than the Karloff/Cushing adaptations) but it stills throws in far too many changes for my liking; we get a plague of cholera, Victor's mother dying in childbirth, Waldman getting stabbed, Elizabeth returning to life – I can understand why some of the changes, especially the latter, were made, in order to add more drama into what is a part-travelogue, part-letter driven narrative – but others serve no purpose I can think of. For instance, Clerval survives the film, but to what effect? None that I can think of.The film has had a large amount of money spent on it, and the costumes, scenery, make up, and effects are all quite wonderful, aided nicely by an effectively sweeping Gothic score. The problem with this movie, then, lies in the characters and performances of the characters in the film. Although the movie is packed with British thespians, only the two leading men contribute efforts of any worth. Branagh is good, yes, but we're used to him being excellent, so being only good is a letdown. De Niro is great and throws an unusual spin on the emotional character of the Creature; I don't think anyone else could have been quite as convincing as he is here, and the scenes of his ""birth"" are the most moving in the film. I especially like the handling of the creature and the blind hermit (played by Richard Briers), the best bit of the film, without a doubt, but still changes have been made to the original tale (where did the children come from?).Other noted characters – such as Cheri Lunghi and Ian Holm – are so far in the background that they barely register as people, just moving puppets instead. Holm is OTT but even that is swept aside by the orchestra and the bombast of the production. Tom Hulce is particularly bad as laughing-boy Clerval, his character poorly-sketched and inane, a far cry from the imaginative lover of nature portrayed in Shelley's story. John Cleese and Robert Hardy have fun in very minor parts as university lecturers but that's about it. Oh, and then there's Helena Bonham Carter; I usually like this unusual actress, but she's quite terrible in her early role here, and totally unconvincing as happy-go-lucky Elizabeth. Far more effective is her unsettling appearance as the deformed Bride, a bad-taste addition to the book which transforms Victor from a misguided saviour of mankind to a cold and ruthless killer who thinks nothing of sawing his fiancee's head clean off in order to serve his own foul purposes. How could Branagh and co. make such a profound error of judgement in order to throw in a few more ghoulish shocks into their movie? Horrific, maybe, but totally out of character for the earnest scientist.I actually preferred BRAM STOKER'S Dracula to this movie, as it contained more Gothic flavour and atmosphere than this somewhat lacklustre offering, watchable but far from memorable, a fact which is even more galling considering the calibre of those involved.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
2,SnoopyStyle,more overblown costume melodrama than horror,6,20 September 2014,"In 1794, Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) is obsessed with reaching the North Pole. His ship is frozen in and he encounters Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) followed by his monster (Robert De Niro). It's back in 1773 Geneva. His father Baron Frankenstein (Ian Holm) brings home the orphan Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) whom Victor loves as they grow up together. After the death of his mother, he vows to eliminate death. In 1793, he's studying in Ingolstadt under the tutelage of Professor Waldman (John Cleese) and befriends Henry Clerval (Tom Hulce). Waldman is experimenting with electricity inspired by the Chinese. When Waldman dies, Victor steals his notes and tries to create life despite Waldman's warnings.This is more of a costume drama than a horror. There is a fundamental problem with director Kenneth Branagh's vision. It feels like a lifeless melodrama. He's better off to cut out much of the beginning. Most of it is unnecessary other than introducing Helena Bonham Carter and having his mother die. The monster should be the heart of this movie but it takes too long to get there. The grotesque is so close but Branagh holds back. Instead, he's concentrating on making a broad melodrama. This is the shameful part because the experiment and the monster is well done. The overblown melodrama actually fits that part of the movie. The inclusion of the original ice voyage is again unnecessary but at least, it's something different.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
3,Hitchcoc,Perhaps My Favorite Frankenstein,10,6 January 2017,"While there are differences from Mary Shelley's earth-shattering novel, this version is quite true to the author's original. Not only that, the portrayal of the ""monster"" as a sophisticated man is much more true to the creature portrayed in the book. This personage, portrayed by Robert DeNiro, is fully aware of who he is and that he has been betrayed by Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) who throws him out like yesterday's garbage. The monster begins to resent the lives that others have and vows revenge on his creator. There are terrifying scenes of murder and mayhem. But the issue that is so poignant is whether such a creature has a soul; whether something composed of the parts of other humans can see eternity. This is one of the most philosophical portrayals of 19th century ethics I have seen. Excellent sets and mood inducing music.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
4,mark.waltz,Be sure to hide aspirin inside your popcorn!,4,2 November 2016,"Everything in this film is overkill. The blood, running camera blocking, the operatic musical score, the screaming, fire, ice, and the ultimate overkill, death itself. I thought that the usage of a bit of excess in the earlier ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was simply perfect, but what do filmmakers do when they succeed? Try to improve, and while that's admirable, in most cases, they fail miserably. For every ""Sound of Music"", there's a star, and for every ""Deer Hunter"", there's a"" Heaven's Gate"". Even Mel Brooks, brilliantly spoofing the monster legend with ""Young Frankenstein"", became ridiculously silly decades later with ""Dracula, Dead and Loving It"". So it goes to follow that with this monster follow up that may leave you with a migraine. I stand by this, because I saw it and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" in the the after when they were first released in the theater.From the swirling cameras to frenzied special effects, this reminded me of why the second ""Indiana Jones"" film got very mixed reviews. It fails to realize that sometimes, less is more, and don't try to improve on practical perfection unless you are sure that indeed (without ego), it is perfection. This really does have some good things going for it, but a mixture of moods and energies are its failings. There's no denying that both Kenneth Branaugh and Robert DeNiro tried their very best, but the script doesn't flow easily, and too much attention is focused on trying to give DeNiro's monster constant sympathy. Helena Bonham Carter, as Branaugh's life long love, spends much time as the traditional fragile heroine, only coming to life, ironically, when her character is dead. Tom Hulce plays a buffoon medical student, while Ian Holm and Cherie Lunghi are touching as Frankenstein's parents. However, as the mother, Lunghi looks more like his sister, much time scattered past between his childhood and adulthood.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
5,claudio_carvalho,Underrated Version of the Classic Story,8,26 December 2013,"In 1794, in the Arctic Sea, Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) is a man obsessed to reach the North Pole, pushing his crew to the exhaustion. When his ship hits an iceberg, she is stranded in the ice. Out of the blue, Captain Walton and his men overhear a dreadful cry and they see a stranger coming to the ship. He introduces himself as Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) and he tells to the captain the story of his life since he was a little boy in Geneva. Victor is a brilliant student and in love with his stepsister Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), an orphan that was raised by his father Baron Frankenstein (Ian Holm). In 1793, Victor moves to Ingolstadt to join the university and he promises to get married to Elizabeth. In the school, Victor befriends Henry Clerval (Tom Hulce) that becomes his best friend. Victor gets close to Professor Waldman (John Cleese) and decides to create life to cheat death, but Waldman advises him that he should not try this experiment since the result would be an abomination. When Waldman dies, Victor steals his notes and tries to create life. He succeeds and gives life to a strong Creature (Robert De Niro), composed of parts of deceased persons. However he realizes that his experiment is a mistake and he abandons The Creature expecting that it could die alone. however The Creature survives and learns how to read and write, but he is a monster rejected by the society and by his own creator. The Creature decides to revenge from Victor killing everyone that he loves.""Frankenstein"" is an underrated version of the classic story. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, the dramatic story was not well accepted by the professional critics and by many viewers. I saw this movie in 1995 and I have just saw it again on DVD, and it is a great movie that has not aged. Unfortunately I have never read the novel by Mary Shelley to compare with this version that ""is considered the most faithful film adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Frankenstein de Mary Shelley"" (""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"")",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
6,classicsoncall,"""Eventually, the best way to cheat death is to create life!""",6,2 November 2018,"This may be someone's idea of the movie being the best adaptation of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" novel, but you can't prove it by me. It does start out convincingly enough but eventually goes off the rails with the creation of the Bride of Frankenstein using the same method that brought Robert De Niro to life as the Frankenstein Monster. You know, I had to laugh when the actor made his first appearance as the creature. A better choice might have been an unknown talent at the time because De Niro's celebrity comes through and it didn't quite work for me; I just kept seeing a disfigured De Niro in an uncharacteristic role.The thing that made no sense to me was the manner in which Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) decided to bring Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) back to life. Assuming one could use a combination of some liquid suspension and electric eels to shock a dead body back to life, why take the long way around and chop up that body and mesh it with the body parts of another individual? Why not just use the shock treatment on the original subject without mutilating it? And even then, the disfigurement of Elizabeth's face apparently appeared to be done for shock value and no other discernible reason.Perhaps the story's best takeaway is the pathos involved with The Creature bemoaning his fate, a tortured in spirit monster who harbors love and rage in his heart at the same time. In that respect, the picture's finale remains true to the premise of the story, that the creation of human life from the deceased can only result in an abomination. I will say this though, the movie inspired me to seek out the Mary Shelley novel that introduced Victor Frankenstein, et al, to the literary world. No strange coincidence, as the book was on a left over display of Halloween inspired material at my local library. Preferably I would have liked to read the book first before seeing the picture, but in this case, it probably doesn't matter all that much.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
7,gavin6942,The Best Adaptation That I'm Aware Of,7,9 June 2009,"Victor Frankenstein creates a living man from pieces of deceased men. The creature he makes, though, feels abandoned, and soon turns bitter and plots his revenge on Frankenstein. The viewer is torn between its sympathy for the creature and its pity on Frankenstein.Another reviewer has written that this film ""takes a big dump on all previous 'Frankenstein' films from an almighty height."" The language is a little more colorful than I am used to using, but the sentiment is completely accurate. Having read and enjoyed the ""Frankenstein"" novel (though ""Dracula"" is better), it was nice to see a telling on film that didn't wander too far from the script.With Robert De Niro as the creature and Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth, the cast is very impressive. Throw in Ian Holm and a few other acting giants, and this should be a memorable film. Somehow, though, I fear it has fallen through the cracks and has not been recalled by many. Even I was somewhat confused about the DeNiro presence. Everything in this film runs smooth -- the directing, photography, the pace. There's an odd light-hearted moment with the creature and Frankenstein slipping in what is either water or amniotic fluid... that probably could have been cut. Overall, though, this the definitive ""Frankenstein"" adaption.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
8,lee_eisenberg,"from here, the story can go no further",6,15 September 2008,"A common criticism of Kenneth Branagh's version of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" is that Branagh (who plays Victor Frankenstein) focuses too much on lavish sets, as Francis Ford Coppola does with his version of ""Dracula"". True though that may be, we can say that Branagh's version stays faithful to the original novel. I've read the novel, and I would describe it as what Jane Austen would have written had she penned an editorial against science. Seriously, it was a real anti-science screed.So, while the movie suffers under its own pomp, it does also show the monster's (Robert DeNiro) side of the story. Probably what makes the movie slightly hard to take seriously - so to speak - is the presence of people like John Cleese and Tom Hulce (Pinto in ""Animal House"").But overall, I recommend the movie. It's mostly a good way to see an authentic adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. A look at the dangers of taking out ambitions too far. In case you're wondering why the monster looks as he does here, Universal Pictures has the more famous image copyrighted.Also starring Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm and Aidan Quinn.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
9,jboothmillard,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,4,27 June 2005,"The novel by Mary Shelley has been remade and reversioned numerous times, the Boris Karloff version is obviously the most famous, this version directed by Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Hamlet, Thor, Cinderella) is probably the one that sticks closest to the source material. Basically Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) grow up in Geneva with his adopted sister Elizabeth Lavenza (Helena Bonham Carter), who becomes the love of his life. Victor's mother dies, whilst giving birth to his brother William, he vows as a scientist to find a way to conquer death, he studies at university in Ingolstadt, where he befriends Henry Clerval (Amadeus's Tom Hulce) and finds a mentor in Professor Waldman (John Cleese). Victor comes to believe the only way to cheat death is to create life, Professor Waldman warns him not to follow through with his theory, as it is an ""abomination"", after Waldman is murdered, Victor takes his notes and begins work on his creation. Victor makes a creature using dead body parts from various sources, including Waldman's murderer and Waldman's own brain, Victor becomes obsessed with his work, and does not stop during the cholera breakout, he even sends away a concerned Elizabeth. Victor finally completes his work, and brings his creation to life, but soon after recoils in horror at what he has done, and renounces his experiment. The Creature (Robert De Niro), hideously deformed with facial and bodily scars and stitching, escapes and runs into the wilderness, with Victor's coat and journal, he spends months living in a family's barn without their knowledge. During this time the creature learns to read and speak, he tries to get closer to the family anonymously helping them, and converses with the blind Grandfather (Richard Briers), but the returning family chase the creature away and abandon the cottage, the creature reads the journal of Frankenstein, learns of his creation and vows revenge. Victor believes the creature is dead, and returns to Geneva to marry Elizabeth, the family is devastated when his younger brother William is murdered, servant Justine (Trevyn McDowell) is framed for the crime and hanged by a lynch mob. The creature approaches Victor, demanding to meet him, the creature demands that Victor make a companion for him, promising that if he does he and his mate will disappear, Victor does gather his tools he used before, but he refuses to use the body of Justine, breaking his promise, the creature vows revenge. Victor and Elizabeth are married and takes precautions when they go on honeymoon, but the creature accesses Elizabeth's bedroom and kills her, in desperation Victor races to bring her back to life, stitching her back together, with Justine's body parts. He is successful and Elizabeth awakens as a reanimated creature, the happy reunion is brief, as the creature appears, Elizabeth approaches him, then she is horrified to realise what she has become, Victor and the monster fight for her affections, but Elizabeth commits suicide, setting herself on fire, and causing the mansion to burn to the ground. Victor has been telling this story to ship Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn), leading an expedition to reach the North Pole, Victor has been searching for the creature to kill him, he dies of pneumonia, the creature finds him and weeps, in the end a funeral is held, the creature takes the torch for cremation, and burns himself alive with Victor's body. Also starring Sir Ian Holm as Baron Frankenstein, Robert Hardy as Professor Krempe, Cherie Lunghi as Caroline Beaufort Frankenstein, Celia Imrie as Mrs. Moritz, Hugh Bonneville as Schiller and Jim Carter as Executioner. Branagh directs fine, and casting himself as the mad doctor he does fine also, Francis Ford Coppola assists producing, De Niro does give a good moving performance as the man-made monster, and the supporting cast including Hulce, Carter and Cleese are suitable. The creation of the creature is indeed the most spectacular scene, and the special effects and make-up serve their purpose well, I think the only problems are that, though faithful to the novel, it is not as frightening (or ways funny like the 1931 classic) as it should be, it is more about the design and content, not enough heart and soul, but overall it's not a terrible horror film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Production Design. Okay!",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
10,ccthemovieman-1,Deserves To Be Appreciated,9,16 October 2005,"I didn't appreciate this film until the second viewing, when I saw it on widescreen. Three viewings later, I have nothing but the highest regard for this Frankenstein rendition which is still, as other reviewers have pointed out, the most underrated of movies.One MUST see this on widescreen DVD to full appreciate the incredible visuals. But this film is a lot more than eye candy. Supposedly, it was very close to Mary Shelley's book, which is the best compliment you can give it.I liked the fact that the ""monster"" could talk and comprehend and, frankly, I liked the revenge factor and fact the monster decided his fate, not hysterical townsfolk as in the original Boris Karloff film (which has a sadder ending.)This version, in my humble opinion, also had a more appropriate ending: the monster and his creator both dying together.All the main characters acted the way you would think they would, meaning there was no ridiculousness here, as so often is the case in horror films. In other words, there was great realism put in a story that is a famous far-fetched-type of tale. To be fair, there are some scenes in which you wonder how the monster got where he did (inside homes, etc.) without being seen....so, to say there weren't SOME credibility issues would not be true...but overall, no complaints here.I'd like to put a quick plug in here for the music, too. Wonderful sweeping classic music complements the astounding visuals. Add an involving story that is tough to put down once you start viewing, and you have one of the most undeservedly-panned movies of our time.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Hint: costumed horror epics are hardly the place. This is a highly unpleasant, indifferent take on the infamous story of Victorian-age madman who brings a corpse to life. Lumpy, overlong, both unsettling AND boring, Branagh doesn't even try to keep this thing on track. His own performance as the insane doctor is frenetic and uneven, and, puzzlingly, self-admiring.

14,Coventry,It's Alive  but not lively!,6,18 February 2008,"During the early 90's, generally not the greatest period for horror cinema, there was a short but nevertheless noticeable revival of the genre's most classic & legendary stories. Apart from Kenneth Brannagh's modern update of the Frankenstein novella, there also was Francis Ford Coppola's interpretation of ""Dracula"" (undeniably the most famous one of the bunch) and the unsuccessful re-telling of the ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" story in ""Mary Reilly"". These modern versions benefited from superior production values and all-star casts; yet personally I can't say I was a big supporter of the initiative. They're all fine films, no arguments there, but they somehow feel like an excuse for younger horror fans to simply neglect the 'dated' black-and-white originals. The 1930's versions of these tales still form the standard, as far as I'm concerned, and they remain fundamental viewing if you desire to call yourself a fan of the stories. That being said, Brannagh's interpretation of Frankenstein is obviously a good and visually striking cinematic effort, but it honestly won't impress you that much if you're familiar with versions from past eras. Much more than the other aforementioned titles, it too often feels like Kenneth Brannagh intended to bring the ultimate version of ""Frankenstein"" and therefore it occasionally feels preposterous and overly obtrusive. Also, and in spite of some really engrossing moments (especially during the last half hour), the director puts the emphasis too much on the sentimental aspects and nearly not enough on the petrifying side of the story. Quite a lot of footage is dedicated to Victor Frankenstein's private life. His role as obsessed scientist is always second to his role as concerned and romantically tormented patriarch of the Frankenstein clan and therefore Brannagh can't hold a candle to the performances of previous Victor Frankensteins like, say, Colin Clive or Peter Cushing. Even the creature as well, albeit masterfully depicted by no less than Robert De Niro, can't seem to find the right balance between frights and pity; something that showed almost naturally in the older versions. A lot of material feels like unnecessary padding and slows down the pace whereas the essential parts of the film are not strong enough to rescue the wholesome. The settings and costumes are deeply impressive, as is the whole new make-up job on the Frankenstein monster (Robert De Niro's mutilated face is likely to shock and repulse the more squeamish viewers amongst us), but the film overall fails in the department of substance. Some highly acclaimed actors are offered too little character depth to work with, like Ian Holm as Frankenstein's father and John Cleese as his reluctant mentor, and others can't bear the heavy burden that comes with the character, like Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Brannagh himself. I would easily recommend ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", but only for the terrific illustration of decors and make-up and, foremost, only after having seen the ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935)",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
15,Hey_Sweden,"Kenneth Branagh's ""Frankenstein"".",7,5 April 2012,"Actor / director Kenneth Branagh's film of the literary classic certainly offers all of the things that a big budget, major studio production can afford. This is very large scale stuff, melodramatic to a fault, with admittedly eye popping sets and costumes and booming music by Patrick Doyle. The movie isn't exactly subtle about its messages, either, as it shows the price that men pay for their obsessions. The wraparound serves as a cautionary tale to intrepid sea captain Walton (Aidan Quinn), as he and his crew run into Victor F. (Branagh), in hot pursuit of his creation (Robert De Niro), while on their way to the North Pole. Victor relates his entire tragic story to Walton, as he yearned to go beyond standard teachings and probe the mysteries of life and death, eventually contriving his own being, who does not take kindly to what he sees as an act of abandonment. The creature becomes determined to get back at Victor any way he can, forcing the creator to face up to the problems that he had caused. (At least in this adaptation, co-written by Steph Lady and Frank Darabont, our mad scientist had nothing but the best intentions and has the good sense to be racked with guilt, rather than creating a miracle for the sake of his own ego.) The movie does have good energy, to be sure, although there are times that the camera is moving too much for the movie's own good. The acting is very sincere from all involved. One doesn't exactly ever forget who's playing the creature, and he won't make anyone forget Karloff, but De Niro still doesn't really do a bad job at all, and he does sell the sense of rage and passion of the character. In fact, his scenes as the creature learns to speak and makes a connection with an old blind man (Richard Briers) are the best in the movie, and it's at this point that the movie truly becomes involving. Branagh, who looks pretty good running around with no top on, makes Victor a multi dimensional, flawed yet compelling protagonist, and the supporting cast is superb, with Tom Hulce as Henry, Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth, Ian Holm as Victor's father, John Cleese, in an impressive dramatic performance, as Professor Waldman, and Robert Hardy as Professor Krempe. The atmosphere is undeniable (those scenes on the ice floes are full of foreboding) and, importantly, the story does build to an emotional peak, getting better as it goes along and delivering a whopper of an ending. While this adaptation may not attain the classic status enjoyed by the 1931 Universal film or even the 1957 Hammer version, it's reasonably entertaining and amounts to a fairly well paced two hour & three minute long study of one man's folly and need to accept responsibility.

16,Doylenf,Visually impressive but still a disappointment...,6,11 October 2010,"KENNETH BRANAGH gives dramatic Shakespearean treatment to Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN, playing every scene as if he's in a Greek tragedy of tremendous depth. His over-the-top histrionics become increasingly overwhelming as the film goes on and on, badly needing some tightening in story structure. Instead, it comes across vividly in bits and pieces, stitched together much the way the monster itself was created by Victor Frankenstein.There are genuinely frightful moments with creepiness made more effective by Patrick Doyle's score, but there are equally moments that serve no purpose in the story and are there simply for shock effect, such as the mother's death during childbirth.ROBERT DiNIRO has to suffer beneath extravagantly scarred make-up but does a creditable job as the creature. Despite the realistic make-up, he's never as scary as Boris Karloff in the original Universal film nor does he ever overact the role the way Branagh does with Victor Frankenstein.HELENA BONHAM CARTER is fine as Elizabeth and has some shocking moments toward the film's climax. Visually the film has some majestic photography and the special effects for the fire scenes are both realistic and gruesome.This may be a more faithful rendering of the ""Frankenstein"" tale, but due to clumsy story structure and length, it's never tight enough to produce the kind of thrills it was after.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
17,CinemaSerf,"Good, but a touch too much self-indulgence from Branagh.",6,9 August 2020,"This could have been a far better interpretation of the wonderful story of the man-monster but it lacks potency. Frequently a problem when one of the stars is also the director; the focus becomes a bit blurred and in this - despite the super performance of Robert de Niro in the title role - the result is a rather meandering story devoid of the usual swathe of emotions ""Frankenstein"" usually evokes. Aiden Quinn is ""Walton"" an explorer obsessed with reaching the North Pole. When his ship collides with an iceberg, they are stranded only to encounter ""Victor"" (Kenneth Branagh) who proceeds to regale them with his story of how he, as a brilliant student attempted to cheat death by creating a creature restored from death. The scientist succeeds, but rejects his abhorrent creation to the elements expecting it to perish. It doesn't and is soon on it's own path of revenge on it's creator and on those whom he loves. To it's credit, it has none of the bolt-through-the-neck stuff; it is closer to the original story and has little of the James Whale to it; but it also lacks soul and ""humanity"". On paper, a great cast should have added depth to the story, but somehow there is just too much going on, the story is allowed to meander and the empathy and pity normally felt for the monster just saps away leaving us with quite an hollow shell of a recollection. The imagery is great, though - from the costumes and make-up through to the menacing lighting; all contributing well to the aesthetic of this tale of late 18th century science and morality. It's worth a watch, but this is still story that cinema needs to do more justice to.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
18,poolandrews,"""The best way to cheat death...is to create life"" - Victor Frankenstein.",6,18 April 2005,"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein begins with some scrolling text that reads 'the dawn of the Nineteenth Century. A world on the brink of revolutionary change. Alongside political and social upheaval, scientific advances that would profoundly change the lives of all. The lust for knowledge had never been greater. Among the pioneers, Captain Robert Walton, an explorer, obsessed with reaching the North Pole. As the prize drew closer his voyage would uncover a story to strike terror in the hearts of all who would venture into the unknown...' An on screen caption informs us that it's the 'Artic Sea 1794', a boat is tossed about by giant waves during a ferocious storm. The crew spot an iceberg, despite their best attempts the boat becomes grounded on an icepack & completely frozen unable to move. Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) orders his men to free the vessel. As they work a shadowy figure walks towards them out of the mist, it's a Dr. Victor Frankenstein (co-producer & director Kenneth Branagh). But there is also something else out there, something both hideous & dangerous. Inside the Captain's quarters Frankenstein begins to tell a tale, a tragic & unbelievable tale... A tale which starts in 'Geneva 1773', Victor lives in a very big posh house & is the young teenage son of famous physician Baron Frankenstein (Ian Holm) & his wife Caroline (Cherie Lunghi) who also have an adopted daughter named Elizabeth (Helena Boham Carter) & a natural daughter named Justine (Trevyn McDowell). 'Three years later', Victor is studying to become a Doctor, like his Father. His Mother is expecting a baby but dies during childbirth, this is Victor's first experience of death & leaves a big impression on him. Victor & his adopted sister Elizabeth are now engaged to be married after Victor returns from University to further his education & research. Now it's 'Ingolstadt 1793', Victor arrives at the University of Ingolstadt & almost immediately upsets one of his teachers Professor Krempe (Robert Hardy) with his unorthodox ideas, another teacher named Professor Waldman (John Cleese) looks & listens on in the shadows. Victor befriends another medical student named Henry Clerval (Tom Hulce) as he continues to upset the establishment with his ideas. Professor Waldman decides to have words with Victor, Waldman also shows him some of his experiments that regard the re-animation of dead tissue with electricity. Victor is fascinated & when Waldman is murdered he finds his notes & decides to save Waldman's brain by transplanting it into another body & bringing it back to life. Victor succeeds, but only in creating a twisted vengeful creature (associate producer Robert De Niro) with only one thing on his newly transplanted mind, revenge against the man who created him... Starring, co-produced & directed by Kenneth Branagh I thought this was a good solid adaptation of Mary Shelley's famous novel Frankenstein by screenwriter's Steph Lady & Frank Darabont. It has wonderful production design credited to Tim Harvey, Frankenstein's laboratory equipment & dark brooding Gothic surroundings have surely never looked better. The Swiss locations look beautiful as well. I didn't think the cinematography by Roger Pratt was particularly special though & the film as a whole looked a little flat & unadventurous. The acting is good by all concerned, although Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth didn't impress me as much as everyone else (sorry Helena!). Robert De Niro as the monster is terrific, he looks just like I would imagine a crudely stitched together man would look like in reality helped greatly by the impressive make-up effects De Niro is buried under. Unfortunately Frankenstein has a great opening half that is well paced, interesting & entertaining but a poor second half that just goes nowhere fast. After Frankenstein has created his monster character motivations & actions are somewhat underdeveloped. To be honest not much actually happens during the second half, although one or two moments keep things moving along & helped to maintain my waining interest throughout the two hour running time. And that's another problem, it's far too long & this film could have done with being edited down by at least twenty minutes, I mean the opening & closing sequences that bookend the film are unnecessary in my opinion so that's ten minutes straight away Mr. Branagh! There isn't much gore in it, a ripped out heart, some gruesome looking cadavers & some stitching with needle & thread. There are also a couple of graphic hangings, too. Overall a good horror with maybe a little to many soap-opera melodramatics for my liking & a definite poorer second half than first. Certainly worth a watch & I'd imagine it would be pretty easy to find a cheap copy somewhere or watch it on T.V. for free, not bad at all.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

What a mess. Less a movie and more two hours of people yelling and beating their chests about things. There's barely a single reaction that a character has in this movie that is not over the top. No one displays emotions subtly and no performances are subdued. Everything is overwrought and frenzied and, frankly, unpleasant to watch.You would think an actor with the talent of Kenneth Branagh would direct with some restraint but damned if he doesn't approach the film like he's setting fire to curtains in a theater and laughing while the people run for their lives. And his acting! I love this guy in so many roles but here he's running around like Tommy Wiseau starring in A Streetcar Named Desire. The only interesting parts of the movie are when Robert DeNiro's monster is around, particularly the few times he's interacting with Branagh. And it's not because DeNiro is objectively 'good' in this (he's not; he stinks to high heaven), it's just that it's so bizarrely fascinating to watch two fine actors using entirely different approaches and arriving at the same terrible result.I really didn't like this. As a horror movie, it's nothing to get worked up about outside of a few feeble attempts at violence and gore. As an adaptation of Shelley's novel, it's more faithful than any version I've seen to date. Whether that's good or not, I'm not really sure. All I know is the finished result is disappointing, mainly due to Branagh's directing everyone, including himself, to act insane.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Scary, graphic and quite good version of the story",7,2 July 2005,"Let me start off stating that I've never read the original novel by Mary Shelley(though from what I hear, this is one of the most accurate versions, as far as film goes). This is a very good story of how man tries to 'beat' or fight death, and of how a lack of concern for the repercussions of your actions can come back and haunt you later. The main problem with it, however, is that it comes off heavy-handed and grand, seemingly attempting to be more than it is. The dramatic music seems overdone, as does much of the dialog. But for what it is, it's quite good. There are plenty of jump-scares, and the violence is well-done and effective. The plot is well-written and interesting. The pacing seems a tad odd, at times off, but mostly works to the film's advantage. The acting is great, in particular DeNiro as the Creature. It's an unusual role for him, but when you think of how much effort he puts into each and every performance, it makes perfect sense. The characters are well-written and credible. The film is thoroughly entertaining and well-made, though it does occasionally become too heavy-handed and Branagh is at times self-important. In the end, I would guess you'd be better off reading the novel... but if you feel like watching a fairly good visual presentation of it, this film would be a good choice. I recommend this to fans of anyone involved in the production of it, and possibly of the original book. Don't expect it to follow the novel word-by-word, though. 7/10",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
21,view_and_review,Frankenstein's Turn,6,19 August 2020,"In 1992 we got a romanticized version of Dracula. It seems that its success brought two like-minded movies in 1994: ""Wolf"" and ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."" Neither of them reached the acclaim level of ""Bram Stokers' Dracula.""""Frankenstein"" seemed too rushed. It was a big expensive production with a more than adequate budget. It had the look and feel as if they had to cut down a three hour movie to two. Things developed too quickly which made the key characters seem as though they were overly emotional and driven without a substantial motive.All the proper elements were there for the movie to be as good as ""Dracula"": the budget, the cast, the set, and the story. If they could've slowed things down just a tad then the movie would've been so much better.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
22,AlsExGal,The when-not-if sequel to ...,6,21 May 2020,"... Francis Coppola's hit with Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), and which sank quickly at the theaters for not following in its parent's footsteps--Coppola had other projects, tried to give it to another director, and ended up with one of Kenneth Branagh's first few attempts at non-Shakespeare movies, which Coppola later tried to distance himself from. It's also one of the most omnipresent of the Sony/Columbia Orphans, just about every-darn-where on streaming (if your service has ""Gattaca"", ""Fifth Element"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Last Action Hero"", ""Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"" and ""Dracula"", rest assured this one will be nearby), and I'd thought I should finally get around to streaming it just to be curious about why it hadn't lived up to its pedigree in the theaters.It's actually not bad, now that we know what to expect: Branagh's since moved away from Shakespeare (after ""Hamlet"", he could never get another one back in theaters), and now specializes in gloriously overproduced period epics with costume/production-design abandon. Back in 1994, we didn't think of Ken as ""the director of Marvel's Thor and Disney's live-action Cinderella"", but now that we do, it's a full-tilt exercise in period-production budget. Like Coppola's film, the idea was to (claim to) go back and explore the themes of the original novel, and Ken's performance and Frank Darabont's script does a good job with that, showing Victor Frankenstein as a privileged rich-kid medical student destroying everything for his one personal obsession, in a Regency-steampunk lab powered by electric eels instead of Universal-Horror lightning. Robert DeNiro is intended to play the monster, and does a good job with the book's idea of a verbose creature who questions his own existence, but he's playing it a little too DeNiro--With just a few stitch-scars and a big cloak, he comes off not so much as an unearthly creation, but more like the escaped criminal that Pip met at the beginning of ""Great Expectations"".It's good viewing if you take the movie at its own face value--There's one scene that deliberately tries to copy Coppola's abstract, dreamlike ""Dracula"" style, presumably to give in to Francis's complaints, and it sticks out from the rest of the movie like a sore thumb. The movie goes at Branagh's own wildly enthusiastic cosplay pace, and like his Hamlet movie, Ken's default style seems to be, when in doubt, shoot the scene Big. The story's attempt to top itself at every plot point does start going a little overwrought by the climax, but we realize that while he may not have made a Coppola followup, what he's done is create the world's most expensive Hammer film...Which is not always a bad thing.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

His performance carries the whole film, and he makes a believable titular character and shows raw emotion throughout.De Niro, however, is not what you'd expect. I was expecting a Max Cady'Bickle sort of monster, but here, ironically enough, he is the most human character in the whole movie.The film gets lost a little in the final third, and the added 'treat' of the Bride is mis-handled and not really necessary (haven't read the book, sorry) and takes the film in a different direction.All in all, it's a beautiful film to look at, with some great performances, but it can drag at times.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
24,Wuchakk,"Gothic mania with Kenneth Branagh, Robert DeNiro and Helena Bonham Carter",7,12 March 2014,"Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version of the oft-filmed Frankenstein story was the most faithful to Mary Shelley's 1818 novel up to that point, which explains its name. It features fine actors and looks great (sets, costumes, locations, etc). There are several quality scenes, like the creature's time spent with the peasant family where his unseen help is taken for a ""good spirit of the woods.""The first time I viewed the movie I was a little turned off by its manic style. People are introduced, scenes flash by, times shift and the soundtrack blares, which struck me as overdone. The characters seemed so melodramatic at times, emoting, yelling, running, confronting, fighting, dying: ""Ahhhhhh!!"" ""NoooOOOOOoooooo!!!"" I just wanted them to stop, take their meds, and chill for 5-10 minutes. I've since read Shelley's book and watched the even more faithful version, Hallmark's ""Frankenstein"" (2004) with Luke Goss playing the creature, which runs almost 3 hours.Seeing this version again I appreciated it more and was able to see how Branagh provides a nice balance between the hyper moments and more subdued sequences. If it sometimes seems too manic it's because Branagh tried to cram the bulk of the novel into 2 hours. On the positive side, this makes it play better for those who prefer constant thrills, melodrama, etc. The 2004 version has almost another hour to play with and is more subdued and brooding. This one's more of a ""blockbuster.""Speaking of the 2004 rendition, the creature is more faithful to the book (with long black hair and white teeth), but he's also too handsome in a dark gothic way, resembling Type O Negative's Peter Steele. The creature in this version removes the hair and opts for a more gruesome depiction, which fits Victor's description of the creature as ""hideous."" In any case, De Niro does a fine job in the role.My favorite part is when the monster finds sanctuary with the rural family, unbeknownst to them. It helps the viewer get to know the creature and have compassion on his plight, but soon all sympathy is pretty much lost. On the other hand, he IS a 'monster'; and he has an interesting discussion with Victor in his remote glacial dwelling in the high country, which helps explain his actions. The locket-framing sequence is lame, but that was a weak point of the novel as well.While this version and the 2004 one are the most faithful to Shelley's book, they each omit parts and change certain things. For instance, both omit Victor's traveling to Scotland and, later, Ireland, which was a good call. This version alters a certain character's death to a lynching while in the novel it was court-ordered hanging. Regardless, I enjoyed the surprise plot turn in the last act, which I'm not going to give away. And the tragic ending is well executed.""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" is similar to ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) in that they both look awesome and were produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Any problems are due to translating convoluted 19th century gothic horror classics to modern cinema.The film runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in England (Shepperton Studios) and the Swiss Alps.GRADE: B+",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Robert DeNiro gave a brilliant performance as the Creature almost unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein but I was confused by why he abandoned his creation perhaps he realized his abomination. Shelley was way ahead in writing about how man wants to play and be God but not realizing the consequences. The film has a strong supporting cast with recognizable British actors and actresses. Helena Bonham Carter is great as Elizabeth but don't forget Ian Holm as Victor's father or Cherie Lunghi as his mother.

27,JamesHitchcock,One of the Great Modern Myths,8,22 December 2012,"In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" rather than simply ""Frankenstein"". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity.Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like ""Godfather II"" and ""Taxi Driver"", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. ""King of Comedy"", ""The Mission"" and ""Cape Fear"" were all examples of this power, and ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of ""heritage drama"" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in ""Frankenstein"" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word ""myth"" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably ""Much Ado about Nothing"" and ""Hamlet"", but it runs them a close second. 8/10",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,"One of the best horror stories of all time, truly a wonderful movie",9,29 July 2002,"In the 90's there was a string of remakes following the classic universal monsters: Dracula(Bram Stoker's Dracula), The Wolf Man(Wolf), The Mummy(The Mummy) and Frankenstein(Mary Shelley's Frankenstein). Sadly this is a more overlooked remake that I feel is a very strong movie. Not to deny any praise to the original Frankenstein from the 30's, Boris Karloff's performance is still one of the best and it's still a very scary movie. But there was no Frankenstein film to come out that would remain true to it's original story. In high school we read Frankenstein and it brought up so many interesting conflicts, where do you draw the line between living and playing God? Was Victor responsible for Elizabeth's death? Was the creature really a monster or just a victim? Kenneth Branagh took on this story and did an absolutely wonderful job.Victor Frankenstein is the son of the wealthy Baron and Caroline Frankenstein. At one point in his childhood Victor's parents adopted Elizabeth, who would become the love of Victor's life. Years later Victor's mother dies giving birth to his brother William. Sometime before going off to the university, a grief-stricken Victor vows on his mother's grave that he will find a way to conquer death. On the night of his graduation Victor and Elizabeth promised to wed when Victor returns from his studies. He finds a friend in Henry Clerval and a mentor. Victor comes to believe that the only way to cheat death is to create life. Victor spends months in his apartment working on creating a living, breathing creature. Using dead body parts from various sources, he begins piecing a creature together. Late one night Victor finally gives his creation life, but he recoils from it in horror and renounces his experiments. But it might be too late for him to take back what he shouldn't have messed with in the first place.Robert DeNiro did a great job playing The Creature, what a heartbreaking role to take on and he plays it with such amazing sympathy. He says to Victor ""Did you ever consider the consequences of your actions? You made me, and you left me to die. Who am I?"" and you seriously feel so much for him, he is the true victim. As in the book and not in the original movie, Victor does feel like a God when he is doing his experiments, but when he succeeds, he regrets it immediately. Kenneth did a wonderful job taking on this complicated man who isn't evil by any means but a victim of his own intelligence and wanting to cheat death. The supporting cast is wonderful with Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Hulce. The film can be a little over the top at times playing like a soap opera, but when I read the book, that's how I felt about the story as well. The sets, the costumes and the make are just incredible. Frankenstein is an underrated gem and deserves a better look.

In a roundabout way, it's similar to the Universal Classics because The Monster or Creature is created by Frankenstein and becomes abandoned and lonely for ""someone like him"" - a bride - but that's about as far as the similarities go. The Creature himself is more similar in looks to the classic Hammer Horror ""Frankenstein"" with Christopher Lee than any of the Universal Horror Classic 'Monsters' (Karloff, Chaney, Lugosi & Strange).As far as the story goes Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) has a good take on the tale but not nearly as good as Universal or Hammer Horror films.

De Niro or ""It"" or ""the Creature"" as he's known in the movie has his body kidnapped by one of Prof. Waldeman's fanatical students Vic Frankenstein, Kenneth Branagh. Vic wants to continue the Professor's experiments of creating life out of dead matter. And in him being as dead as you can get De Niro is the perfect candidate. Vic getting body parts from a dozen or so other cadavers and sewing them together has De Niro brought back to life. unfortunately he develops a severe identity crisis by not knowing just which of the people that he's made off he is? He also being nameless becomes the precursor of the famous Clint Eastwood ""Spaghetti Western"" character ""The Man With No Name"". For his creator Vic forgot to Christen or name him thus he's always known and referred to in the movie as ""The Creature""! I don't think we're even told what De Niro's character's name in ""Frankenstein"" was before he was executed?Like Tavis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" the Creature considers himself ""God's lonely Man"" and yearns for a mate, Cybill Shepherd's Besty from the movie Taxi Driver?, to fill his idle time as well as give him a normal life. It wants Vic to provide him with a woman by creating one out of human spare parts like Vic created him.

Now with the Creature all alone in the world he immolates himself on a floating sheet of ice together with the dead Vic who throughout the movie It had a love/hate relationship with.The movie is way over-the-top in the gore department even for a horror flick with all kinds of weirdos like the Creature and Vic and Pro. Waldeman as well as Vic's step-sister, I think?, Elizabeth, Helena Bonhan Carter, whom he marries. And it's her whom The Creature later kills in order to get Vic to bring her back to life and make her his ""Bride"". There was also the crazed ship captain in the beginning and end of the movie who's obsession to find a passage to the North Pole was more important to him then his life as well as the lives of the members of his expedition.

32,Robert_duder,Despite a terrific cast this Frankenstein demands yawns and not screams,5,16 September 2007,"I like Kenneth Branagh I think he is a terrific actor and probably a gifted film maker. I have seem him in some truly magnificent roles but he has this experience and tendency to make this brilliant, lavish epic Shakespearean type stories and to try and put that element to something like Frankenstein, even if that was Mary Shelley's intention, just didn't work. Frankenstein has been portrayed in many different Hollywood films and always as a piece of Horror or action/Horror and I respect Branagh for trying to change that and go back to the more classic literary aspect but I don't think it's what people want and to try and make this story that way is not going to work. Even in trying to make the story more dramatic and important the film turned out to be far less about the creature that was created, and more about Victor Frankenstein and his existence and life and how this situation effected him and I thought that wasn't really the moral that should have been aimed at. I honestly had thought the film would be a lot more visually captivating than it was, I mean it had it's moments and there was definitely the element of darkness and this bleak existence around it but it still wasn't stunningly done with special effects.I have no doubt that directing and starring is no easy feat and I respect any person who can do that. Kenneth Branagh's performance of Victor Frankenstein is wild and over zealous I think. He has moments of complete insanity that are a little over done. I think he really did sink his heart and soul into this project but just maybe got a little carried away but perhaps that is how he wanted Victor portrayed. Robert De Niro...what on earth do you say about Bobby De Niro. I mean the man could do anything and I'd watch him endlessly do it. De Niro plays none other than the Creature itself and does a pretty decent job at it. I find him almost tamed compared to Branagh's wild performance but there is no doubt that he is violent and merciless and you do feel the necessary empathy for the creature, just not as deeply as I would have hoped. To be completely honest I think Helena Bonham Carter as Branagh's love interest is ridiculous. She looks hideous with her enormous hair and dark dresses and thick make up, and her and Branagh look ridiculous together. She has no real emotion to the story and the very important love story is a joke basically. Tom Hulce plays a small, rather unimportant role as Branagh's friend in school and later partner but never really does anything significant.Where I think Mary Shelley's Frankenstein really loses it's steam is that the film is boring. Instead of utilizing all the greatest parts of the legendary story it drags on and on and goes over the same issues over and over again and never really makes you care about the characters. In fact the whole thing feels kind of campy when you're said and done and it's not meant to. I think the goal was to make this classic seem real and vivid and instead a lot of time it seems like a big joke. You never really feel the right emotions for any of the characters including Branagh's Frankenstein or De Niro's creature, or Bonham Carter's jilted lover, or anyone. Clocking in at over two hours Branagh tried to make an epic out of what should be more of a nicely little packaged thriller, monster movie with perhaps more of an emotional tie. Instead this one is a sleeper if I've ever seen one. 5/10",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
33,Cineanalyst,Dancing Frankenstein,8,26 August 2018,"After re-reading Mary Shelley's story, I've sought out a bunch of Frankenstein films--something I previously did with Bram Stoker's book. Like its predecessor, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), this film places the author of the original source in the film's title, and both films are highly stylized adaptations that diverge significantly from their novels, especially by adding romance. Producer of this film and director of the prior one, Francis Ford Coppola handed this project off to Kenneth Branagh and, based on the 1992 film, which I have mixed feelings for, I'm glad he did. As also demonstrated by his Shakespeare productions, Branagh shows an appreciation for the themes of his source material and in adapting them cinematically. Moreover, he manages to stitch it together with the (seemingly obligatory) movie romance, which is what killed Coppola's ""Dracula.""Thematically, which I think is the important thing--as opposed to story particulars, Branagh's film is the more faithful to its source. For his romance, Coppola took the reincarnation romance device from prior Dracula movies--mainly the 1974 TV movie of the same name by Dan Curtis. This also led to the inflation of Dracula being the historical Vlad the Impaler, a connection that was only speculated by Van Helsing in a couple sentences in the long-winded novel. The reincarnation romance is entirely absent in Stoker's ""Dracula,"" who was a decidedly non-romantic and villainous figure. Shelley's book and monster is comparatively more tender and passionately philosophical, which in that respect lends itself better to romance movie conflation, despite vampires being an easy allegory for sex.For this, ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" expands the character of Elizabeth, as well as Professor Waldman earlier on, for a similar teacher-pupil relationship that's every bit as romantic in its passionate scientific dialogue despite its platonic nature. For a modern movie, I dare say this is an improvement on the source; ironically, despite being written by a woman, the female characters in ""Frankenstein"" are mostly passive, including Elizabeth and Justine, and with one mother being dead and the other a wretch. Dracula movies usually have the opposite problem: whereas Stoker features a heroine who becomes a leader and surrogate storyteller within the story, the film adaptations, including Coppola's, reduce her to a damsel in distress or a concubine of the Count. The only distasteful consequence of this film's approach in this regard is that the character of Henry Clerval is reduced here to the stupid friend type of comic relief that's more at home in bad rom-coms.This film features and understands the doppelgänger theme, of man's drive and the risks of progress, between Frankenstein and Walton, a framing device usually absent in adaptations, without over-burdening the film with the epistolary plot of the novel, and the movie, as with the book, still contains narratives from the perspective of three different characters: Walton, Frankenstein and his creature. Frankenstein's journal here also compensates for the condensing. Also unlike most Frankenstein films, the creation scenes don't prominently feature lightning, but lightning does have a more playful part in an earlier scene here. In fact, there's quite a bit of play early on, especially between Victor and his mother and Elizabeth, which helps to establish women as active participants in this romantic adaptation. It also helps that the female lead is portrayed by a strong actress, Helena Bonham Carter, for once.Much of the playing involves dancing. It's an odd addition to a Frankenstein adaptation, but it perfectly suits its operatically cinematic style, with camera movements that swoop through the action, as well as the brisk pacing and score, which some have derided as ""loud,"" but I find entirely welcome. The sets, including the large ballroom and staircase, also fit into this design. The visual motif of dancing camerawork serves an interesting function when it returns in the creation scenes, as well as Victor's use of dance to jog the memory of his Bride, and even the film's mob scenes play out like grand operatic numbers. In the laboratory scenes, Frankenstein employs electric eels coming from a hanging balloon sack into a filled tub. A key ingredient for this Frankenstein, also, is embryonic fluid, which he steals along with the usual body parts. As Caroline Joan S. Picart (""The Cinematic Rebirth of Frankenstein"") has also mentioned, Victor and the camera's dance-like movements during creation strongly imply sexual acts, which is further evidenced by the the sack and eels standing in for a scrotum and semen, as they provide a mother-less birth to the homunculi in the womb-like tub filled with embryonic fluid. The scenes are also much more akin to natural birth--physical and messy--than those in the 1931 iteration and its many imitators.Robert De Niro's creature is also good. He's not as eloquent as Shelley's version, but he's more articulate than Boris Karloff's and his many imitators, while still retaining the misunderstood childlike nature of Karloff's monster. I also like the addition of the film tradition of ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" which helps to expand woman's role in this creation myth. The 1935 sequel is the closest of the Universal classic horror films to depict a fleshed out female character, which couldn't be done by simply adapting the novel, and, instead, was only realized by inserting the source's author in the story and realizing the unfulfilled promise of Shelley's Frankenstein.(Note: There's a mirror shot of Frankenstein after he becomes horrified at his creation.)",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Frankenstein movie, not a Santa Claus movie! We see all the events that led up to this.It seems to take too long for the monster to appear. I have never read the original novel, but I did read this play version and it seems to be pretty faithful. The full title IS ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"".

37,filipemanuelneto,"An effort to be faithful to the book, but presumption and self-importance bothers too much.",8,22 August 2017,"When the young Mary Shelley wrote ""Frankenstein"", she would be far from imagining the impact that it would have. There are literally dozens of films that address that story but cinema never succeeded in making a film that reproduce original novel. This film is the one that comes closest to the book, although it also presents changes. Many are very positive but some of them have no obvious purpose and should have been avoided. For example, the character Clerval was so ignored that he virtually became a prop in the plot, as well as the majority of Frankenstein's family. Even so, its a meritorious effort and worthy of congratulations. Despite this, the public is often mistaken in the judgment that makes of this film. As the name ""Frankenstein"" is strongly associated with horror, public is led to think that this is just another horror film when its actually a drama. The deception leads some public, who seeks horror, to be disappointed with what they find but, let me stress this, this problem lies in the public and not in the film. We should try to understand a movie for what it is, not what we expected to find.In addition to this effort to be faithful to the book, the film presents excellent filming locations, although some sets may have been better and more faithful to the period in which the story was placed. Frankenstein House hall, for example, with that huge staircase, absurdly disagrees with the location chosen for the exteriors. Costumes, on the other hand, seem more acceptable and historically accurate. The cast is very strong. Of course, with so many stars, a lot of them didn't have the proper time to shine. Kenneth Branagh is very good in the lead, although sometimes theatrical and unnatural; Tom Hulce was mediocre in the role of Clerval because his character was very mistreated by the writer; Ian Holm and Helena Bonham Carter were OK; John Cleese, Robert Hardy and Trevyn McDowell fulfilled but didn't delight us; Robert De Niro did the most striking work in a melodramatic, intense, powerful and psychological portrait of a character who, in other films, was merely an instrument of horror.Despite these merits, the film has a big flaw: it's too melodramatic, full of presumption, self-importance and aspirations of greatness. The emphatic dialogues and attitudes are very theatrical. Soundtrack is magnificent but its too insistent, permanent and likes to appear too much. The movie is very good but it's far from being an epic, and the problem lies in the fact that it looks like it wanted to be. And no one really likes excessive vanity.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Unlike other productions which portray the creature as a horrible, despicable monster, this movie attempts, with some success, to show the creature as a victim of circumstances. Although at some points in the movie the dialogue is ridiculous, Robert De Niro's performance as the creature is credible. What is not credible, however, are the performances of the other members of the cast. Victor Frankenstein is hysterical and his lady something of a shrill. They inspire little sympathy and the horrible acts perpetrated by the creature are almost glossed over to the point that one can reasonably ask: what is all the fuss about? The creature had a right to be upset. After all, he didn't asked to be manufactured. But plausibility is stretched to the limit by asking the audience to believe that such a foolish, emotionally labile man as Victor Frankenstein could actually have the ability to create life from death ... and then do it AGAIN?",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
41,ackstasis,"""If you deny me my wedding night... I shall be with you on yours!""",8,20 September 2007,"After sitting down and watching Kenneth Branagh's 'Frankenstein' for the first time, I find myself thoroughly bemused. His 1994 adaptation of Mary Shelley's famous novel met with pure venom on its original release, and is now widely regarded as nothing more than a failure, and yet it is brilliant. Having read and loved ""Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus"" just a few weeks ago, I came to realise how James Whale's 1931 film  despite being a cinematic masterpiece  had completely butchered Shelley's original story, and had permanently distorted how the general public viewed the Frankenstein tale. Thus, Kenneth Branagh took it upon himself to craft a worthy adaptation to a remarkable novel, creating a visually-stunning, highly-theatrical, gripping, wildly over-the-top tragedy that is largely faithful to its source material. Basically, it's the version I'd been yearning to see.Branagh portrays the ill-fated Victor Frankenstein, whose heartfelt bid for eternal glory ends in his losing everybody he cares about. Despite what others have voiced, I thought that he was excellent in the role. Robert De Niro lends his mighty talents to the Creature (and the filmmakers make a point of declaring that, in fact, the monster doesn't have a name), an immense, horrific, repulsive abomination of nature, whose hopeless existence nonetheless commands a certain sense of pity. Helena Bonham Carter is very good as Elizabeth, Victor's devoted life-long love (and adopted sister). Competent supporting performances also come from Ian Holm as Baron Frankenstein, Tom Hulce as good friend Henry Clerval and John Cleese completely unrecognisable as Professor Waldman (or, at least, I never noticed that it was him).Kenneth Branagh comes from a background in theatre, and so it's no surprise to see that he plays the story as a sort of theatrical Gothic melodrama, and he overplays Victor just the right amount. For those striving for realism, this might just seem silly and contrived, but, if you consider the fantastic nature of the plot, it is probably the most reliable direction to steer. At times, however, the director seems unsure as to exactly what genre he wishes his film to be, and it occasionally seesaws between straight horror, swashbuckling adventure and high camp. The sequence in which Victor succeeds in resurrecting Elizabeth from the dead (the one major deviance from the original novel) seems like something that might have sprung from the mind of Tim Burton, and, aside from demonstrating the phenomenal make-up work, it is much too cheesy to fit in with the tone of the rest of the film.I'm in two minds about Robert De Niro's performance as the Creature. When I was reading the book, I imagined that his creation would be a terrifying appearance, with the resultant monster a nasty, repulsive indignation towards Mankind. Instead, the Creature was simply pathetic; I can't imagine anything more morbidly wretched than Victor frantically wrestling his creation's lifeless form within a pool of amniotic fluid. Nevertheless, even given a limited vocabulary, De Niro commands attention from the audience, with his character's waverings between sensitivity and malevolence leaving us with conflicting emotions towards him. All in all, Kenneth Branagh's 'Frankenstein' is an excellent adaptation of literature's first great work of science-fiction, which is as respectful to the source material as it is visual stunning. Roger Pratt's cinematography is simply exquisite, particularly his sweeping aerial photography of the Swiss Alps. Visual effects are integrated well, complementing the story but never overshadowing it. For fans of Mary Shelley's novel, I can't help but recommend it.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
42,smatysia,Decent adaptation of Shelley; Could have been better,7,19 August 2001,"A fairly good adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. You know, Jules Verne is often credited for inventing science fiction, but one has to acknowledge Shelley, whose book predates Verne's by 20-30 years. Anyway, it's been about 20 years since I read ""Frankenstein"" so I'm not completely up on all the details. It seems that the first half of the movie stayed reasonably close to the novel. There were some significant changes later. To adapt the book, some sort of arctic scenes were necessary. Branagh was OK as Victor Frankenstein. Ian Holm and Tom Hulce did nicely in small parts. I didn't even recognize John Cleese. Helena Bonham Carter, as usual, turned in an excellent performance in a period piece. Her beauty helped the film a lot, and the contrast between that look and her later incarnation showed the suffering of the ""Creature"" even more than De Niro's look. De Niro was great in this film. The problems with the film were due to the script and adaptation. I think that De Niro rasped his lines plenty well enough to disguise his usual Brooklynese. And anyway, who can complain about De Niro's accent, when all the other Swiss and German characters spoke with British accents? I thought the film could have better portrayed one aspect of the book, the eloquence of the creature. There were a few flashes of that, but Shelley's creature came to speak like a very well-educated man. Branagh emphasized the suffering of the creature, which is, of course, also essential to the story. Overall, this film is well worth seeing, but probably not worth buying. Grade: B-",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
43,barnabyrudge,"Disappointing version which tries to be faithful to the original story, but fails to ever really get going.",5,6 November 2005,"Actor-director Kenneth Branagh made big noises about the fact that his version of the Frankenstein story follows the Mary Shelley novel more closely than previous ones. However his claims were a touch misleading, as there had already been two very faithful TV movie adaptations, the first being Frankenstein: The True Story (made in 1973 with James Mason), the second Frankenstein: The Real Story (made in 1992 with Patrick Bergin). What Branagh was probably trying to get at was the fact that the two most successful cinematic versions of the story (the 1931 Universal release and the 1957 Hammer classic The Curse Of Frankenstein) were not particularly true to the original source material. This 1994 adaptation does, however, try to stick to the plot and themes of the Mary Shelley story. Unfortunately, for all its respect and accuracy towards it origins, it still emerges a disappointing movie. There's no real sense of terror, mood nor atmosphere.Arctic explorer Captain Walton (Aidan Quinn) comes across Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) wandering in the frozen wastelands. Walton takes Frankenstein aboard his ship, where the latter sets about recounting the amazing story of how he came to be there.A young and brilliant science student whose mother died during child birth, Frankenstein recently created and brought to life a man-like creature (Robert De Niro). However, the creature later escaped and fled into the neighbouring forests. Having spent time observing people and seeing seeing what it means to be human - especially the very ""human"" emotion of love - the creature returns to demand that Frankenstein create a second, female creature that will become its mate. By this point, Frankenstein has developed serious misgivings about the whole experiment and refuses to agree to the creature's demands. Angered, the creature seeks it vengeance by tracking down and killing Frankenstein's friends and family, while leaving the man himself alive to wallow in guilt over the terrible beast he has unleashed upon mankind. Realising the creature's plan, Frankenstein leads his monstrous creation into the Arctic wilderness where he plans to destroy both it and himself.While the film looks suitably impressive, thanks to Tim Harvey's production design and Roger Pratt's rich photography, it has no real heart. It's just a cold and uninvolving affair, filled with scenes and performances that seem generally staid and unenthusiastic. De Niro is the only actor who really does himself justice, giving a thoughtful and physically commanding performance as the creature. Branagh is not convincing as Frankenstein (he is clearly more suited to Shakesperean roles, and lacks the chilling believability of, say, Peter Cushing); the usually-dependable Tom Hulce gets too little screen-time as Frankenstein's friend Henry Clerval; and Helena Bonham Carter's scenes as Frankenstein's adopted sister Elizabeth are too overwrought, giving the actress no hope of developing an appealing characterisation. The best scene in the film is easily the part where De Niro's character comes to life, but at most points this is a totally unfrightening movie. All the effort and energy has gone into the designs, little into the film's more horrifying aspects. All things considered, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a disappointment which, while watchable, should have been much better considering all the time, money and talent that has been thrown at it.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

The reviews were mixed, some critics hated Branagh's film-making style or the way De Niro looked as the creature. There's some flaws in the storytelling and Branagh's camera work might be a bit too much for some tastes. The performances are highlight here and they give their 100 %. The actors played their roles effectively, especially in the supporting cast like Tom Hulce, Bohnam Carter, Ian Holm and Clesse. The monster also looks different than most Hollywood movies. Since filmmaker Five Time Oscar-Winner:Francis Ford Coppola was probably looking for the same success for Bram Stoker's Dracula.

DVD's only extras are an production booklet and trailers. This movie went on to have an cult following, nonetheless and it went on to be one of the most underrated horror/fantasy films of the 1990's. This one of the better adaptations of this classic tale and it is certainly not the worst one yet. Patrick Doyle's (Carlito's Way, Much Ado About Nothing, Needful Things) music score is one of the stand-outs here. De Niro also worked as the associate producer. This film received an Oscar Nominated for Best Make-Up. Screenplay by Steph Lady and Frank Darabont (The Green Mile, The Mist, The Shawshank Redemption). Darabont disowned the film, when Branagh did many uncredited re-writes of the script. For it's all flaws, this is certainly worth seeing. (****/*****).",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

The main image that stuck with me is Kenneth Branagh running around his laboratory shirtless, pulling levels and chains while the body swings around frantically-- it's like a scene from an action movie. So half of the movie is silly stuff like that. But then there are some genuinely upsetting moments, the most obvious being when the monster pulls Elizabeth's heart out. I remember seeing that in the theater and thinking this was one of the most messed up movies I'd ever seen. Not to mention Elizabeth lighting herself on fire and bring the whole estate down with her. Those two sequences are still effective, but most of the rest is just a melodramatic period piece. I can't imagine a horror movie fan watching this today and being satisfied.

47,dworldeater,Horrible,3,12 January 2017,"The film, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a big budget snoozefest that is a boring watch and a really poorly made movie. While the film is sharp looking and the period costumes and sets look great, the film is hard to watch. The film is way too long and self indulgent on the part of director/leading actor Kenneth Branagh. The film is more horrible than horror and lacks the proper tone or narrative to pull this material off. There is a lot of stuff that should have been on the cutting room floor and a more subtle approach to this would have gone a long way to making this a better film. In this instance, less would have been more. Instead, Brangh thought big and the film is a terrible disjointed mess. This epic piece of big budget garbage has little in the way of horror and is more of a period melodrama with bad storytelling, big scale swashbuckling action, a bombastic score and hammy acting. None of which does the material any favors and is a pretentious mess. In addition to dropping the ball with the direction of the film, Kenneth Branagh stunk it up big time with his lousy performance as lead Victor Frankenstein. But don't just take my word for it. Both screenwriter Frank Darabond and producer Francis Ford Coppala have each come out publicly to disavow the film. The film flopped in the US when it was originally released theatrically and had Francis Ford Coppala directed it as planned it would have been a much better film and a companion piece to his awesome Bram Stoker's Dracula.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
48,adamjohns-42575,"Once good, now bad?",2,14 August 2020,"When I first watched this film I remember being amazed at how good it was and thinking what a brilliant and original version of the story they had made (According to the Trivia section it's just a mashup of all the others that went before it). It's funny what 26 years can do for an opinion and while it is still, probably, the best version of Mary's classic that I have personally seen, it is now somewhat over the top, badly directed and performed by a mostly theatrical cast, who seemed to have struggled to leave the stage behind and therefore are unable to tone down their portrayal in a more convincing and believable way as we expect from films today. Not only that, but it is so rushed and I don't know why? They could quite easily have made it a longer film and enabled better pacing. Even my ageing Mother commented that there was no real flow to it.
I think Robert deserves a mention for his delivery of ""The Monster"" however, as it wasn't until the credits came up, when I first watched it, that I even knew that it was him (Before IMDB) and he did a good job, apart from a few obviously bad directions he had been given by Ken.
Weirdly enough, the comic actor John Cleese gave one of the other best performances along with Robert Hardy, Ian Holm and Richard Briers, but you can't mess with actors of that calibre.
Helena, of course, played Helena as she has in every film before and every film that has followed since, while Kenneth seemed to be rehearsing for the exaggerated character of Gilderoy Lockhart (Harry Potter 2), certainly for the first 45 minutes at least.Overall, I would describe it as quite hammy and the closest of the other Frankenstein films that I can compare it with is the farcical ""Young Frankenstein"".
As with most Book to Films it does make me want to read the story in order to build my own idea of how things should be and what Mrs Shelley was actually saying, but you can't deny, even from watching this film, that the story is a great one to start with.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

50,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Grand retelling of this classic story,8,15 August 2019,"I remember when this film came out. It was on the heels of Bram Stoker's Dracula that was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. This was also produced by him as they tried to go grander in the retelling of these classic stories. I know I saw this film when it first came out, but didn't remember a lot of it in my rewatch right after college. It had been almost close to a decade before checking it out here. My synopsis is when the brilliant, but unorthodox scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) rejects the artificial man that he's created escapes and later swears revenge.For this film, we start in the North Pole on a ship that is looking for a passage there. The year is 1794 and the man runs into issues when he's caught in a storm that strands his ship on the ice. The captain is Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn), who wants to push on, but they have to wait for the ice to break. There is then weird yelling heard in the distance. Capt. Walton and his men then encounter Victor. He's taken aboard and telling them they need to flee, that there is a phantom that will kill them. Robert is determined and asks Victor to tell him his story.This goes back to when Victor was a boy. He's living with his mother, Cherie Lunghi, and father, Ian Holm. A young girl, whose mother passed away and named Elizabeth, is going to live with them. Victor's mother is pregnant and dies in childbirth. This happens though when Victor is an adult and Elizabeth has grown into Helena Bonham Carter. The family is distraught, but Victor makes it his life journey to conquer death.Victor expresses his love to Elizabeth before heading to Ingolstadt to study medicine. He befriends Henry (Tom Hulce) and makes an enemy of a professor, Krempe (Robert Hardy). He secretly befriends another one, Waldman (John Cleese), who is working on an experiment to overcome death. When Waldman dies in an accident with a sharp featured man, Robert De Niro, Victor steals his notes and starts to conduct the experiments.He shuns those around him, including Elizabeth. She travels to Ingolstadt to see him, just as a breakout of cholera hits, quarantining the city. Victor throws himself into his experiments and goes about finishing what Waldman started. He is able to bring life to his creature, which is played by De Niro as well. Victor has a change of heart and tries to kill his creature. It flees before he can though.The two end up living two completely different lives. Victor goes back home to marry Elizabeth. The Creature becomes the 'spirit of the forest', living in a barn of a family. He does things to help and actually 'remembers' how to read. When this living situation is ruined, he decides it is time to face his creator with an ultimatum. He wants a mate so he can experience life and not be alone. This requires Victor to break his word and go back to his research.Now something I have to commend this version is that they stayed pretty faithful to the novel in that they played out most of the major parts that I can remember. I do really like that aspect of it. It's been some time since reading that novel, but I'm glad this version kept together what the original Universal split into two different films. They did include here some new things as well.For one, I don't mind giving Victor a reason to try to conquer death. He was very close to his mother and that really affects him when she passes. On top of this, there's something that happens on his wedding night that he again foolishly decides that he needs to go back to his experiments. I actually would say that Victor is the villain in this film. He tries to play God, creates life and then decides that he doesn't want it to live. Elizabeth and his professors try to talk him out of it, but he persists.Next I want to talk about the Creature. He's such a tragic character to me. He didn't ask to be born. He is shunned by the townspeople and called a monster at every turn. It is actually a look at how bad society is, as they aren't giving him a chance due to his looks. He really just wants to have someone to love him and can't find that. I don't blame him for the change and trying to ruin the life of Victor, as he tries to get everything when this creation has nothing. I also like the idea that there could be residual memories in the parts which allows it to learn to play the recorder and read so quickly, especially with the brain that is used to revive it. It actually explains a lot for something I don't recall being in the novel and adds something to this film. Plus for a long film, having those aspects prevents it from lingering on things.There are some issues I had with the film. I did not care for the concept that electric eels are used to bring things back. This is a good idea; I don't mind that, my problem is the giant balloon thing that they're kept in during the experiment. It is more logical way of doing it to ensure the body is getting the electricity that is needs. Another issue I had was we saw all the preparation that was needed the first time. For the second go around, he just magically has it all on hand during his wedding night. I get that it would bog down the film, but I don't really like that it is just too convenient.To move to the pacing next, this film actually for its 2 hour running time, really doesn't drag at all for me. We move through the different plot-points of Victor learning and then applying what he has. My favorite part though is showing the duality of the Creature and Victor as they're living separate lives. I think by showing it that way, it is way more impactful to what the Creature decides to do, by humanizing him. I do like the ending as it is pretty much in line with the novel and fitting for humans to face their own morality.The acting of the film I think is pretty amazing. De Niro I think is great as the Creature. He's an actor that I feel later in his career is given a bad rap and we forgot how good he can be. His portrayal here is menacing, but with a touch of tragedy at the existence he is forced to live. There's a lot without talking and he is quite profound as he remembers to read. Branagh is good as Victor. I believe his thirst for knowledge and his level of obsession with his studies. Hulce is solid in his supporting role. I really liked Carter as well as Victor's love interest. She really does ground and somewhat humanize this kind of jerk of a doctor. I thought the rest of the cast did round out the film for what was needed as well, with shout outs to Holm, Cleese and Hardy.As for the effects of the film, I think they're really good as well. I love the look of the Creature. It is way more realistic that what we got in some of the classics. They also make it look ugly in a much different way. There is another creature later in the film as well that I liked. I'm not entirely sure why multiple parts were used for her, but I won't hold it against the film too much. I don't mind the computer generated effects, as that really doesn't affect the film too much. I do think the effects are solid and it is shot very well.Now with that said, I think this is a really good adaptation to the classic tale from Mary Shelley. I like some of the additions to it and keeping most of the events together here. There are some minor plot-holes I have issues with. I think that despite its longer run time, it still moves at a good pace and I never got bored. The acting really creates the duality of two characters, one with it all and one with nothing. It really becomes a tragedy through this. The effects of the Creature are really good and the rest are solid as well. The soundtrack really doesn't stand out aside from an old man playing a recorder and then the Creature doing it later. There is some classic music playing at a party, which does fit for the realism. Overall I'd say this is a good film and one of the better adaptations out there. It does stick with the motif of the period piece for sure. This one despite being darker than the Universal version, I still would recommend to all audiences. It's a classic gothic horror tale with some interesting themes.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
51,Samiam3,THIS is Frankenstein,8,23 February 2009,"For those who are loyal to the classic Boris Karloff portrayal of Frankenstein's monster, this film will make you red with anger. Aside from that, this is a rather brilliant movie. It is not a horror film, it is more of a Gothic drama. The story comes to life with Kenneth Branagh's theatrical mind, and he keeps tight pacing all the way, never plodding for a moment. The acting is decent from everybody, and the movie is full of illustrious camera work, set design, and haunting music. What stands out more than anything however is Dr. Frankenstein's monster.Robert De Nero's performance is unique, because instead of being a mindless hulk, he plays the monster as more of a human being who can talk, think, and even read. He he does not just kill at random, this creature has a purpose which is revenge on his creator for making him an ugly figure. The monster portrayal is the part of the film where it can get controversial. One of the problems with treating him this way is that there is a lacking fear factor. While he may be cunning and villainous, there is no great sense of monstrosity to him. In fairness, one could say that this creature sort of has a life of his own and should probably not be compared to the original Frankenstein monster. The make up job on De Niro is sensational, and it really deemphasizes his mole. He is a whole new kind of Frankenstein.Kenneth Branagh's film does not fully honor Mary Shelley's classic masterpiece, but it feels engaging and fresh, and it shines new light on one of the most memorable literary creations of the 19th century.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
52,Spleen,How could this possibly be unpopular? Here's one or two ideas ...,9,13 July 1999,"It was a mistake to call this ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein""; partly because titles of that sort are manifestly silly, partly because it revived fading memories of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", a wretched movie if ever there was one. The title helped people to think of this film as a turkey.  As a matter of fact it did quite well at the box office in some places (notably Britain). It would have done better still had it not been for the mesmeric spell that the North American box office casts over the rest of the world.This is Branagh at his best - and he is one of the world's greatest directors.  Two scenes are notable in particular.  The scene where Frankenstein is brought to life threw aside all the old (and not very effective) imagery and started from scratch: the result is beautiful (in a disgusting sort of way) as well as convincing.  And the mob lynching around the middle is a masterpiece.  Branagh clearly took the time to understand how a mob works.  There are no flaming torches or upraised pitchforks in sight; no dutifully shouted Gilbert-and-Sullivan chorus (""Kill him!"" ""Yes, kill him!"")  The mob's victim never stands a chance.  We understand why, and we feel the helplessness of it all.But both these scenes are just instances that shine more brightly than the rest.  A sense of obsession and drive is built up from the beginning and sweeps like a wave to the end; and the whole, every frame of it, is gorgeously and grimly shot.  You should be warned that people complain about Branagh's acting, the soundtrack, and the pacing.  I don't know what to say to such people.  I could understand it if they attacked the film where it was weakest. I am mystified when they attack its strengths.  Without the feverish feel - an essential part of the Frankenstein myth - this would be just another safe, dull and forgettable science fantasy.  Perhaps that's what people wanted.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
53,mhorg2018,"Not perfect, but OK.",5,17 August 2018,"A decent, if not perfect adaptation of the Novel, is more true to the material than any other. It does take some liberties, but it is worth watching.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
54,bkrauser-81-311064,Dr. Frazzled Frankenstein,6,6 December 2013,"Aside from Young Frankenstein (1974), I have never actually seen a movie based on the titular doctor. I have never seen the 1931 Boris Karloff version nor Andy Warhol's 1973 adaptation. In fact, I have never even read the novel. Yet the mythos of the character is so ingrained in our culture that the story is known by almost all. Dr. Frankenstein, a gifted but brash scientist digs up an assemblage of body parts and reanimates them to create a monster he regrets.In this adaptation, The story is told by Dr. Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) to Captain Walton (Aidan Quinn), a man looking to make a name for himself by reaching the North Pole. Frankenstein's major impetus for creating life after death stems from the death of his mother giving birth to his younger brother and his major love interest is his adopted sister Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). My guess is family is important to him.While in medical school he befriends a young medical student named Henry (Tom Hulce) and professor Waldman (John Cleese) with similar fascinations with ""alternative medicine"". Waldman warns Frankenstein not to venture further down the rabbit-hole but of course he does and nearly dies of exhaustion attempting to bring his experiments to reality. Once the monster (Robert De Niro) is brought to life, the doctor balks at his experiment and immediately regrets everything he has worked for. The monster however wonders away carrying with it the doctor's journal so naturally the only logical thing to do would be to just forget all about it.Naturally, as with virtually all movies, the bad guy gets his just desserts and we all learn an important lesson on the folly of scientific exploration and achievement. You heard me, the folly of scientific exploration; because progress is an incredible evil that must be stopped or else risk unleashing horrible monsters that will inherit the earth. Its not like Frankenstein could have done a few things differently like have a protocol for destroying the monster then studying it to find where he went wrong. Or failing that he could have always locked the door to make sure his monster doesn't escape.Not that anything really went wrong to begin with. The monster was capable of cognitive thought and motor skills, could speak, read, write and play the flute. It didn't perform ""Puttin' On the Ritz"" but had the song been around in the 1700's I bet he could sing it. Additionally, at the beginning of his second life, he was capable of kindness, mercy, and sympathy. The only bad thing about the monster was his ugly mug. For that reason the good doctor gave up on his project, lamented over what a terrible thing he has done and collapsed sobbing on his pillow like a girl who wasn't asked to the prom. Question: You made your creature out of random decaying body parts, did you expect it to look like Megan Fox? The rest of the story follows the monster who wonders around for a while before he begins to plot his revenge against the doctor with relentless flair. Frankenstein meanwhile gets caught up in period-piece melodrama complete with lavish sets, high society gatherings and Ian Holm. Eventually things turn tragic then just plain gory and at the end of the tale, Captain Walton turns his ship around so he may live to be brazen another day.To be fair the main message of Frankenstein has been around for ages. The Matrix and Terminator imagine worlds where our hubris creates machines that take over the world. A much better (and underrated) adaptation of the story, Splice (2009) involves a similar creation who is begotten by two impertinent scientists who look to achieve practical purposes like curing disease.Conquering death does have its practical purposes I guess but hypothesizing ""in order to cure death we must create life,"" is like saying in order to stop war we need to build better weapons. Furthermore the psychology of the creature and the scientists involved are important factors in the decision making processes in Splice. Frankenstein leaves many of those nuances unexplored leaving you with a good looking movie that seems too frazzled to be impacting.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
55,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Despite a miscast monster and some serious issues with the break-neck pacing, ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" still delivers as a solid take on the classic tale of horror.",7,12 October 2016,"Ask a random group of people for a list of the most recognizable faces of horror, and chances are the name ""Frankenstein"" will appear somewhat on that list. And why shouldn't it? Since the creation of the characters near 200 years ago, Frankenstein (or more correctly ""Frankenstein's monster"") has become an icon of not only horror, but of popular culture in general. With dozens of film adaptations, spin- off works, comics, video games and other examples in just about every other conceivable medium, the story of Victor Frankenstein and his monster is the stuff of legend!One of the more peculiar entries in this vast franchise however has to be director Kenneth Branagh's hotly debated and polarizing 1994 adaptation ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."" Conceived of as a sort-of sibling to Francis Ford Coppola's popular 90's ""Dracula"" feature, the film was subject to some behind-the-scenes drama and was met with mixed reception from critics and fans alike. But beyond all of the drama and second guessing, does the film itself work? Beyond the he-said, she-said... is it a good movie when it all comes down to it?...pretty much. It's not the best of the adaptations based around the story, and believe me, it has problems a plenty. But I can't say it was a failure, and if you asked, I'd have to admit that when it comes to ""Frankenstein"" on screen... it's pretty good.We all know the story. A brilliant doctor who is trying to find the cure to death itself. The monster he creates in his attempts to discover the key to creating life. And the tragedy to follow. What sets this particular take on the tale apart is the sheer thrills of director Branagh's (who also stars) visual direction and the wide and varied cast that populates the story. And for the most part, they are the highlights here.Branagh's got a keen visual sense, this much is evident from his vast array of work. Everything from his Shakespeare adaptations to even his more mainstream work like the Marvel Studios flick ""Thor"" oozes his kinetic and hyper-real style. And that's on full-display here. I get the feeling that Branagh is trying to mold the film to reflect the manic excitement of Victor himself, and I do think it's an interesting new way to present the story. With flowing camera-work, tilted angles and wild editing, you really get the feeling of how obsessed Frankenstein is in his attempts to create life and how it all implodes around him due to the unforeseen circumstances of his experiments. It's almost shot more akin to a high-stakes action picture than a tale of Gothic horror, but it works for the most part. Although it can be an occasional detriment during the slower scenes of character and story development. Something co-writer Frank Darabont has bemoaned in some interviews, as he viewed the film as a slower and more dramatic character piece. Still, I think that Branagh's wild eye meshes well with the story being told. He just needs to stop drinking so much caffeine during the slower and more deliberate scenes!The cast is a great deal of fun. Branagh makes for a wonderfully crazed new Victor with the giddiness and the excitement of a schoolboy who simply cannot deal with personal tragedy. Helena Bonham Carter makes for a fantastic Elizabeth, despite often being relegated to the sidelines and you really do root for her and Victor's relationship. Classic actor Tom Hulce is a blast as Victor's best friend. And supporting roles by the likes of John Cleese and Ian Holm are all exceptionally well cast.Then there's the monster. Oh boy. Look, I love Robert De Niro, and I'm sure if I wasn't as aware of him as I am that I'd like his version of the monster even more... but there's no getting around it. When you watch the film, you're not seeing a tragic figure of a monster who feels betrayed and abandoned. You're seeing Robert De Niro under heavy makeup. He's trying his hardest and it's a decent performance, but I can't help but feel it's a major miscast because it's so distracting and once or twice it will take you out of the movie.Beyond that, the production is top notch. Patrick Doyle's dark score is haunting and tragic, and is among my favorites of the decade. Roger Pratt's cinematography is absolutely stunning and is lush and wild and dreary and all things that the story call for. Magnificent work. Tim Harvey and James Acheson deliver a splendid one-two punch with their work in production and costume design, giving everything a realistic but stylish flair to augment Victor's crazed energy. (Don't get me started on Victor's fantastic laboratory set!) And all others involved are on-game in the best of ways.The only major aspect of the production I must question is the editing, which in conjunction with Branagh's deranged visuals causes many a problem and is where the film loses some points. This is just a psychotically edited movie. Yes, I understand the purpose behind it... but it feels disjointed and scattershot as a result, with far too many scenes beginning and ending on a whim without proper establishment or payoff, and some cutting that feels sloppy due to the editor and Branagh trying to fit in as many angles and shots as possible. It's a big problem here and I get the feeling that it's where the film will lose a lot of people.Still, for my money, the excellent cast and visually arresting direction trump these issues for the most part. It may have benefited from more deliberate pacing and a different choice of monster... but it's not a bad film for these issues. Merely a troubled one.And so, I'm giving ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Worth seeing for fans looking for a slightly different spin on the iconic classic.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
56,fntstcplnt,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994),4,26 October 2019,"Directed by Kenneth Branagh. Starring Kenneth Branagh, Helena Bonham Carter, Robert De Niro, Tom Hulce, Ian Holm, John Cleese, Trevyn McDowell, Aidan Quinn, Richard Briers, Robert Hardy, Celia Imrie, Cherie Lunghi, Ryan Smith. (R)A couple years after ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" we get ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" a Gothic melodrama far more faithful in spirit to the book (if not so much in plotting) than any major film version to come before it. Branagh's directorial hand is overwrought and frantic, full of actorly histrionics and unfocused visual energy, every gesture a strike of lightning; that technique may have worked for his sensationally stylish ""Dead Again,"" but its application here suffocates the understated, philosophical nature of Shelley's source material. De Niro suitably brings pathos to his role as the doctor's creation (he's uneven but occasionally excellent) while Branagh swings for the fences and earns laughs, not sympathy; one of the only cast members to refrain from over-acting at some point is Cleese (in a small role), who sounds nothing like Basil Fawlty and looks an awful lot like Billy Connelly. Makeup effects and production design are top-notch--it's a good-looking picture, to be sure, or at least it would be if the camera stopped soaring, swooping and spinning so often. The best scene by far is when De Niro helps a poor family and shares a gentle, thoughtful conversation with the blind patriarch; the second best is when Branagh scribbles down a passage in his journal and then immediately announces that he will be destroying said journal and all its contents in the morning (surely the page appreciated the attention paid to it prior to its execution).42/100",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
57,pyrocitor,Not your typical horror film - much much better,9,21 July 2004,"(spoilers herein)I saw this movie for the first time, in the dark solitude of my attic late at night. (I was trying to create a scary atmosphere for maximum effect) To my surprise, though, after it finished, I wasn't very frightened, but very emotionally drained. I had expected Frankenstein to be your classic, everyday, lame horror film which you only watch to get some cheap thrills, and see some horrible overacting. I didn't find it so at all.This movie was, there is no other word for it, beautifully done - a powerful, dynamic story of how man attempts to achieve greatness, but ends up ruining their lives and the lives of others as a result. I have not read Mary Shelley's book, but if it has half the emotional effect of this movie, I'll consider it time well spent!What really surprised me though, was that this wasn't a horror film in the traditional sense of the word - it wasn't so that the monster would jump out and the audience would scream. It was more about how the audience would slowly writhe as they realize the tortured motivations of the creature and what he's willing to do as consequence.Kenneth Branagh brought this movie together wonderfully, with both his directing and powerful, memorable acting as the tormented Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein is somewhat obsessed with death, after losing his mother at an early age, so he attempts to create a new form of artificial life, derived from various body parts of corpses: a life which cannot be so easily extinguished, and is superior to normal human life in every aspect. (except, perhaps, looking normal) However, he soon learns that it's not good to muck around with creating life, when his creation attacks him, and he abandons it. The creature, although initially showing signs of being a sympathetic and caring soul, quickly learns that the ways of man are harsh and judgmental, so he swears revenge on his creator for bringing him into this world of isolation.The 'creature', was played absolutely masterfully by Robert De Niro. Before Frankenstein, the only movies I had seen with him were Analyze This and Analyze That, and those were comedies, so it was difficult to see his skills as a serious actor, but in playing Frankenstein's creation he created a character that is confused, alone, hostile, manipulative and clever: a very conflicted anti-hero. The scene at the end at Victor Frankenstein's funeral left me in shock by the sheer aura he projects - mixed hatred with compassion and confusion. In my opinion, his best moment is when he meets the ship's captain who asks him 'Who are you?' and the creature nods to his dead creator and responds 'He never gave me a name.' If nobody felt the power in that line, then I don't know what to say to them. I think De Niro deserved an Oscar, or at least a nomination for this role.The supporting cast is also very good, with Helena Bonham Carter doing a wonderful and chilling job as Frankenstein's wife (another one who I think should have gotten an Oscar nod), and John Cleese (in probably the only downright serious role in his career) being very creepy as Frankenstein's mentor, who realized before that the moral implications of his kind of work cannot be lived with. Ian Holm as Baron Frankenstein was also good, but sadly, his part was underused. It would have been nice to see more of this great actor in this movie alongside all these other great actors. This isn't really a problem for the film as a whole: Holm played a relatively minor character, but I have a lot of respect for his acting skills, and I would have liked to see more of them in this movie.This is probably one of the most powerful and draining movies I've ever seen in my life; I was so impressed by it that I had to run out and buy the DVD right away. I realize this film has many critics, who claim that it is 'seriously flawed' - I really can't understand what they're talking about. I guess some people are harder to please than others, but I find it almost impossible to find anything wrong with this film. Perhaps it was expected that it would be more your traditional horror film, but it really wasn't a horror movie - it was a character movie. It's true that there were some disgusting parts (I won't go into specifics, but you can probably get the idea), but they seemed to merely add to the mood of the movie, and increase your revulsion that Victor Frankenstein would have thought of creating such a monstrosity. For anyone who needs a good, powerful movie that'll leave you drained and thoughtful, this is THE movie for you!-9/10",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
58,TheUnknown837-1,gives us too much and not enough,4,7 March 2009,"When it comes to literature, Mary Shelley's Gothic novel Frankenstein is one of the more significant titles to appear. Not only is it memorable in the fact that it was written by a woman in a time when women were considered the lesser of the two sexes, but it also set up new standards for science-fiction and horror that were expanded even further with following plays and ultimately the 1931 James Whale film of the same name, which featured Boris Karloff as the mutinous, growling monster created from dead bodies fused with electricity. Most of the criticism of the 1931 film focuses on the fact that it is only very loosely faithful to Mary Shelley's original novel. This 1994 adaptation, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, is by far, much more adhering to the text, but that does not make it a better film. I didn't think the 1931 Frankenstein was a great film, but it was still twice the entertainment that Branagh's is.The plot is the same one we're all familiar with. A young man (Kenneth Branagh) mad with the passion to create a living being in his own image recklessly instills life into a humanoid made from the bodies of dead men and creates a hapless, but unnaturally durable creature played uncharacteristically by Robert De Niro and before long, his mistake of playing God soon leads to chaos and people near to him fall victim and before long, he soon takes the responsibility of purging the creature under his own wing. But then there's the element that not all of us are familiar with. That the creature has a mind and a heart of its own and that it wants to meet its creator again, with some requests of its own.I do appreciate director/star Branagh's will to stick with Mary Shelley's original novel, but what I did not appreciate was his failure at supplying us with an appreciable motion picture that ultimately turned out to be nothing more than pointless and forgettable.Like Roger Ebert said in his television review of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Kenneth Branagh has a habit of going over the top with his movies and this is another example. There are many scenes in this movie that are way too explosive, way too loud, and way too graphic to satisfy us such as this rather bloody and fast-moving stillbirth scene early in the picture that did not serve any real purpose in the story than just to give us something to look at.That's what this movie really is. Just something to look at. It's a good-looking movie. The cinematography is crystal-clear and beautiful, the set design and art direction is fabulous, the scenery is entrancing, it feels as if we were looking into an actual world far distant and different from our own. But what Mary Shelley's Frankenstein fails to give us is substance and story and development and in stead focuses on its visual impact, which again, goes way over the hill. In short, it gives us too much and not enough. And as a result, its two-hour running time causes it to overstay its welcome. There are scenes that go on for too long and were not necessary and there are scenes that go by too quickly, but were necessary. And with a movie like this, once the audience starts to lose interest, the look of the film doesn't amount to a hill of beans anymore.Are there any positive aspects to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein? Yes, there are. And some of them are quite powerful. Number one, Robert De Niro was fantastic as Frankenstein's creature. De Niro does not rely on his grotesque-looking makeup to give the impression of a troubled creature, but instead embraces and surpasses it with his performance and there were some scenes where I actually felt a little moved because he was so great in the movie. The creature, like in the novel, is not the big lumbering green-skinned monster with electrodes emerging from its neck and mindlessly attacking people in rage. Here we have a sympathetic and tragic living being with feelings and emotions and a mind equal to that of a man's. De Niro gives us the most impressive Frankenstein's creature we have seen yet, even better than the Boris Karloff performance from the original. And that was a classic image. Unfortunately, De Niro is not seen enough and Branagh is seen too much and unfortunately Branagh is playing a very dull Victor Frankenstein.That's another thing I might as well mention. Apart from De Niro, we have no interesting characters. Gene Siskel noted that Helena Bonham Carter's character as well as the others were treated mostly as props in the background and he was correct with his criticisms. I did not connect with any of the characters except for the creature and in a movie like this, that is imperative otherwise you're quickly losing interest.Bottom line, this is a real shame. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a major missed opportunity. It's a well-acted, good-looking movie that I was still thoroughly bored with and unfortunately cannot suspend my disbelief and negative attitude toward the film to give it any recommendation except to those who want to see a faithful movie based on Mary Shelley's Gothic classic.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

60,ElijahCSkuggs,Not as bad as people say...,6,10 December 2007,"FRANKENSTEIN is one of the most creative and historically prominent stories in literature, and after scores of recreations, Kenneth Branagh has decided to give it a try.KB's version is a melodramatic exercise in overacting and great make-up. With theater actors galore, some good set designs, and one or two corsets, this film had the passion and the budget to deliver. And it did, but just partially.Victor Frankenstein, after the passing of his mother, makes an ode to himself to become a successful doctor and search out medical truth through what every means necessary. This leads him to follow in a predecessors footsteps, by continuing work that would inevitably rebuild life.He grows a little mad, and before he knows it, literally, he has a super strong corpse puzzle, who is just a little confused as to what he is and how to act. Frankenstein decides to reject his creation, only to be awoken by his new pal the next morning. The ""monster"" escapes, learns the truth of his life, and swears revenge.Robert De Niro is pretty bad ass at times as the creation, especially one scene where he stands outside a burning cabin, and Helen Bonham Carter is great as well, but both suffer from the occasional ham and cheese, as does the whole of the film(a certain scene with a storm cloud), and you just have to shake your head and laugh.It's not really gory, and not that violent or graphic either, but I guess the subject matter and Kenneth Branagh's chest hair is reason enough to merit an R rating.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
61,KnightsofNi11,Not great but it's watchable,6,22 March 2011,"It's no secret that Mr. Kenneth Branagh loves him some adaptation. He has directed numerous adaptations from Shakespearian plays and is quite good at it. But in 1994 he decided to take a different approach to adaptation and adapt a slightly more modern, yet still classic, story. This was Mary Shelley's chilling novel Frankenstein. He put together a strong cast, obviously including himself, and got himself a nice budget of 45 million dollars to make his film. The result isn't terrible, but it isn't that great either. It is a vastly different telling of the Frankenstein story compared to the brilliant 1931 film from James Whale. It tells of Victor Frankenstein, an intelligent young man who has a very promising future in the field of medicine. But that changes when his mother dies and he embarks on a maddening quest to bring the dead back to life. After practically going insane he does so, but instead of creating a man he creates a monster. And after neglecting his horrific creation, it escapes and swears revenge on its creator. This is a very odd story and it is one that strangely combines romance and horror into an unfortunately disjointed film.If I could fix this film in just one way and one way only, I would have it slow the hell down! This movie starts with a slow brooding intro in the arctic when we meet Victor Frankenstein who is being chased by his monster. He meets some sailors whose ship is stuck in the ice and they take him in. Frankenstein recounts everything that led up to this point to the ship's captain and the film flashes back many years earlier where the Frankenstein's and their friends are all introduced. From here the movie just takes off, throwing so much storyline at you, not taking time to develop anything fully. Relationships are established and the film just moves on. Major plot points occur and the film gets right on through them and on to the next thing. It is a frustratingly rampant film that just I constantly felt needed to just tone it down a bit and develop this story at a normal and more accessible pace. I'm not saying the film moves too fast to comprehend, but it definitely moves too fast to connect.But if you break the film down and just take the story as it comes, it isn't bad. The setup to the creation of the monster is uselessly long and moments get a bit irritating and you sometimes wish the film would move on, which is ironic considering this film zips through its plot at breakneck speeds. I was really getting tired of the film before the monster was finally introduced, and then the film picked up a bit. Like I said, it is a completely different telling of the Frankenstein story, so that was interesting. The development of the monster character obviously moves a little too fast, staying true to everything else about the film, but it does tell an interesting story. Moments of the film get a little boring but keep its flow moving. The last half hour of this film really made me start to rethink my opinions about the film I had had up until then. The ending is great and very dramatic. You can tell the film has been trying to build up to this moment and that sort of failed, but the ending itself is very entertaining. The film does cram all of its themes of life, death, love, and rebirth into the end and it gets a little sloppy, but the story itself wraps up quite nicely.Artistically this is a pretty nice looking film. The monster is designed well and Robert De Niro's makeup is very grotesque, but it's somewhat amusing knowing that it's Robert De Niro of all people under all that. Branagh shows his knowledge of how to direct a film here, and there are a lot of cool tracking shots and hauntingly beautiful frames. But some of it does go into excess at times and after a while you can get tired of all the dizzying tracking shots spinning around characters as they deliver lines with plenty of melodrama. But it's important not to confuse melodrama with bad acting. The acting here is actually really good, albeit cheesy because of a melodramatic script. Branagh is great as Victor Frankenstein and has some really cool scenes. De Niro as the monster is... well, different. It's not bad but it's very strange to watch the monster learn to speak and write, beginning with not knowing anything to speaking fluently and eloquently in what seems like no time at all. Then of course there's the always strange and always magnificent Helena Bonham Carter who does a great job in this film as Frankenstein's love, Elizabeth. She manages to make melodrama easy to watch, rather than painful.There are a number of things that saved this film from being truly awful. If not for the good acting and nice camera-work this film could have been unbearable. This film tells a story with some interesting themes and some creative aspects, but it just wasn't told as well as it could have been. The pacing issue is probably my biggest complaint, but it's just not a film that is made all that well. It tries to be good, and I say that because I know Branagh is a skilled director with a lot of respect towards filmmaking and how to do it. Frankenstein just missed the mark on a number of things, making it just another film that I will surely forget about soon.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
62,esteban1747,New Frankenstein with human feelings,7,24 December 2002,"If you saw the former Monster of Frankenstein played by Boris Karloff compared to this new one played by Robert De Niro, you will see enormous differences between both. Karloff's one is more horror while De Niro's is more literate, he is able to listen, to think, to read and to discover who is the bad doer. In any case, everyone is free to choose any of them. If you are looking for pure horror, then take Karloff, but if you want to see more reasonable film then De Niro is the choice. This film gives the opportunity to reason, in fact the bad is not the monster but his creator, and the film came at the time when some scientists are looking for human cloning not paying enough attention to the problems of ethics of this issue.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
63,qormi,Could Have Been Scarier,7,20 July 2010,"My first impression was that this was a very good film. Then later on, I had some misgivings. Robert DeNiro was, as usual, brilliant. The rest of the cast wasn't - their characters were caught up in the big weakness of the majority of period pieces - stilted, unrealistic dialogue. This is a very big flaw, as it took away the horror that would have been manifested if you were lulled into believing that these characters had any credibility at all. Instead, they were all one dimensional and paper thin. Because you cannot connect with any of the characters (bad acting, stilted dialogue), you don't feel much emotion, even when shocking violence is perpetrated. No amount of gore could make this overly fast-paced and ultimately unrealistic film seem real.The fact that Dr. Frankenstein relied on electric eels for his electrical source seemed silly. The fact that both the Frankenstein monster and the reanimated bride had stitches all over their faces was never explained. The whole thing with the arctic seemed ludicrous. Victor Frankenstein had every opportunity to shoot the monster, yet never got around to it.The 1931 Boris Kharloff version was superior in the sense that it had suspense. This element was lacking here. Also, the Frankenstein monster of 1931, with the swollen head, forehead stitches, and bolted neck was much more frightening. Kharloff outdid Deniro here.All in all, a potentially great film ruined by banal dialogue and overacting.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
64,timdalton007,The Best Film Version Of Frankenstein Yet And A Massivly Underrated Film,9,6 February 2007,"When it comes to the film versions of the classic novel by MAry Shelly, they simply don't come any better then this one. Kenneth Branagh, the actor/director of 1989's Henry V and 1993's Much Ado About Nothing, proved he could take classic material and bring it to life in a new and fresh way. And this film certainly is not a disappointment. How this film got the bad reputation it has received is beyond me.Branagh plays the lead role of the young brilliant Doctor Victor Frnakenstein. As he as proved time and time again, there is virtually no role that he can't play. He is the perfect Victor whose naive views of life and death eventually lead to him creating the creature. Branagh is virtually flawless and never fails to get a moment just right. The true star of the film isn't Branagh however it's Robert De Niro as the creature. De Niro's version of the creature might not be physically terrifying but if you've read the novel you realize the looks of the creature are perfect for the character. The evil and horror of the creature lies not in his appearance as we've trained throughout decades of other Frankenstien movies but in his actions. This is certainly true of the creature of this film who goes from being the misunderstood creation to vengeful creature and by the end back to being sympathetic. It's a journey from the novel that gives this version more depth then every other version I've seen.The rest of the cast is top notch for the most part. The only real dud of the supporting cast is Helena Bonham Carter as the love interest Elizabeth. She spends most of the film being a complete bimbo for lack of a better word although she does get one incredible moment at the end with her death and shortly lived resurrection ending in a literally fiery end. The rest of the supporting cast fills out there roles perfectly. Tom Hulce is terrific as Victor's friend Henry and he becomes the ignored voice of reason throughout much of the film. Ian Holm is at his usual best as Victor's father and it is a real shame we don't see more of him in the film. Add on to them short appearances by Aidan Quinn as the explorer Walton, Richard Briers as a blind man the creature encounters who treats him kindly, and John Clesse as the Professor who inspires Victor's creation. As I said, a top notch supporting cast. The rest of the film lives up to the standards set by the cast. The sets are of the appropriate styling for the film and fit perfectly. The special effects are excellent especially with the sequence where Victor creates the monster and later resurrects Elizabeth. Patrick Doyle's score adds the atmosphere immensely and his score for this film is certainly amonst his finest works to date.The script is the msot faithful of adaptations despite of, or rather because of, many changes to the stroy. Elizabeth's resurrection and firey death is a prefect example. But these changes are all done in the style of the novel and actually act to supplement the material taken from the novel. Otherwise the script is a terrific adaptation of the classic novel.With a terrific cast, terrific sets, good effects, an excellent musical score, and a top notch script from a classic, this version of Frankenstein delivers. Kenneth Barangh has one again succeeded in creating another masterpiece of modern film-making. This one doens't deserve it's bad repuation and shouldn't be missed!",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
65,elicopperman,"Decent Adaptation, Mediocre Movie",5,31 October 2017,"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's 1818 novel, Frankenstein, is to this day considered to be one of the greatest horror novels of all time due to it's clever dialogue, dark tone, elements of the macabre, and the moral of how science should never take away the dignity of anyone. Even though there have been so many film adaptations, none of them were ever really faithful to the book and were more well known in pop culture. But then in 1994, director/writer/actor Kenneth Branagh came out with his own dramatic horror film adaptation of the novel and was ambitious to make it as faithful to the source material as possible. Unfortunately, just because you're ambitious with something doesn't mean everything will go the way you plan, and that's where the movie sinks under.The formula is all there, Victor Frankenstein wants to learn the ways of bringing the dead back to life after a tragic death in his family, but the process he uses ends up being both amazing and horrifying and leads him further into madness. Sadly, the movie feels too convoluted with a straight-forward plot getting twisted with constant plot points, unnecessary and forced attempts at being depressing and scary, and too much time spent on the titular character to give any other characters a chance to shine. It seems to be so overambitious with capturing what made the book work that it feels less subtle about it, and ends up feeling more artsy and operatic which doesn't fit well. But the worst and most ridiculous part of it all would be the altered ending, which nearly ruined the whole movie. Without giving away too much, let's just say that Victor Frankenstein was more crazy about his fiancée than you think.Admittedly, the film does stay faithful to the book sometimes without really spitting in it's face, like Victor's reasoning of performing galvanism, the monster learning that people fear him the hard way, and how Victor gets to meet Robert Walton. However, several other times it makes it's own little alterations that can range from weird to flat out dumb, like how Victor and Henry met and the death of Victor's mother. It doesn't help that the changes they made really affected the characters, both mentally and physically. Victor is still the insane and desperate yet tragic inventor from the book, but Clerval is not well acknowledged, Elizabeth is dull and uninteresting, the monster is still the same but feels less gruesome and more amateurish, and the film will often show a character more (like Justine's mom) than the novel did. It just goes to show that sometimes, things can go in a manner more unintentional than you planned out.As for the aspects of filmmaking, while it does go style over substance some of the time, the sets, backgrounds, and effects still look pretty impressive and quite artsy. This is one of the film's ambitious efforts that actually payed off, even the soundtrack gives the film some suspense and feel of drama. The acting is another story; where some like director Kenneth Branagh, Robert DeNiro, Tom Hulce and Richard Briers do give off pretty believable and charismatic performances, others like Helena Bonham Carter, Aidan Quinn, Trevyn McDowell and John Cleese range from decent, to boring, to less serious and more awkward and goofy, which does not fit the tone of the movie this should be. Also, since the pace can get a little dull, even some of the gorgeous sites start to look the same after a while. When the film gets bloody and graphic, it also works well, but even some of the blood looks pretty fake and sleazy.At the end of the day, it feels like Kenneth Branagh was so ambitious to make his adaptation as faithful as possible to Shelley's novel that he intentionally got some right and unintentionally failed ridiculously at other points. The film has it's similarities that do treat the novel with respect, along with some gorgeous sets, a nice music score, and some depth and drama here and there, yet the differences (some not having much of a point btw) overshadow the similarities complete with hit or miss acting, forced attempts at sad moments(with one exception), and one of the dumbest endings ever seen on film. In a sense, the movie is like focusing more on design than writing: Sure it looks like you really put some sweet time and effort in accomplishing the former, but the ladder really needs some improvement. Now I'm starting to see why the 1930s Frankenstein movies are seen as the superior films, even though they're not faithful adaptations, they work as subtly emotional and powerful movies on their own without going overboard in their style.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
66,frankblack-79961,Viewing it after 20+ years has changed my opinion.,6,31 October 2020,"When this first came out I thought it was a masterpiece. I was also a young man and had not experienced too many films yet. While this is still probably the best Frankenstein film IMO, in a recent viewing I was shocked to find that I really didn't hold it as high of regard as I did. Branaghs acting is way over the too and quite ridiculous even. I saw many things in the plot lines that are what I call lazy screenplay writing. Certain events were so forced by the charachters unrealistic actions that a lot of this film seemed quite silly. Deniro is really the main reason to watch the film. His performance was still quite good IMO. All in all this was a pleasant memory that didn't hold water for me personally with a more mature mindset. Still some great stuff in the film though.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
67,domino1003,A Pretty Little Mess,6,6 May 2005,"On the footsteps of the success of Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula, someone got the bright idea of bringing Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to life. Under the direction of Kenneth Branagh (Who also plays Victor), the story starts when Victor is found barely alive in the frozen wastes of the Artic, where Robert Walden (Aidan Quinn) is on his own quest. Victor tells the captain about the price he payed for exploring things that should be left alone. Victor, spurred by the death of his mother, is determined to defeat death. With the reluctant help of Professor Waldman (John Cleese, in a surprising dramatic turn) and his friend Henry Clerval (Tom Hulce), he creates a creature and, upon his first look at him, abandons him. The Creature (Robert De Niro)only wants to be loved and not feared, but seeing that every person he meets is repulsed by him, decides to seek revenge upon the man that created him. Victor soon learns that the price for knowledge is high, and that those who he loves will fall victim to his obsession.The film drags in the first part, but once the creature and Frankenstein meet, the action picks up a bit. There is some graphic moments (Elizabeth's death was brutal). It is as close to the book as any typical adaption can be. The visuals are nice, but a bit dizzying in some parts (Especially when Victor was busy creating things.). A good companion piece to ""Bram Stoker's Dracula.""",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Overwrought, gore-ridden depiction of the classic Frankenstein saga is a major disappointment when it's less faithful to the narrative source. As usual, Branagh (who stars as the mad doctor) keeps the camera constantly moving through a nightmarish, frantic style.

It goes in the same category as From Hell, they are both too sophisticated and beautiful to be JUST horror films. The cleverness of this film and its sheer radiance must throw some people off.  Robert De Niro is the creature!  De Niro gives the foul beast a soul of his own.  De Niro's performance brings out genuine pity, sorrow, and most importantly, fear.

72,stills-6,A failure,4,26 July 2000,"I applaud Branagh for taking on this work and getting into the guts of Victor Frankenstein. There are 20 minutes of really excellent filmmaking and some innovative visual images. The problem is that the rest of it is so terrible. Despite a mesmerizing performance from Robert De Niro as the unnamed monster, the movie falls flat almost everywhere. Carter is irredemably terrible; Branagh as the Dr. is uninspired whenever he is out of his laboratory; but the real mistake in this film is the storytelling - there were several points where I just wanted to ask: ""What?"" You want to pull Branagh aside and tell him that his fulcrum plot point is so poorly explained and so hollow that the rest of the movie becomes truly pointless.I'm a fan of his Shakespeare adaptations, but I have to say that this movie is just a failure.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
73,GirishGowda,The Road to Hell is Paved With Good Intentions,4,5 August 2013,"Victor Frankenstein is inspired to become a doctor by the tragic death of his mother during childbirth. With the help of his mentor's notes and plenty of necessary human parts, he creates an artificial life form. Victor rejects the artificial man he just created due the horrifying outlook of the creature. He tries to kill it and promises to change his own nature for the better. The monster escapes and later swears revenge.Among the many remakes and reboots of horror classics in the 90's, this one was brought to screen by Kenneth Branagh along with superlative actors such as De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese and Tom Hulce among others. Branagh obviously wanted to class up the epic horror story and so goes for the emotional touch instead of pure horror. Helena and De Niro gave amazing performances, but they are hampered by the hamfisted writing and direction. After a great start to his character where he was totally immersed in it, you can see De Niro almost giving up by the end. Branagh who also plays the lead as Victor Frankenstein is overzealous and an unsympathetic character even when he tries his hardest to make you empathize with him.At the end of the day, the Frankenstein is pretentious, yet flat and uninspiring. There's melodrama and then there's the parody of a melodrama. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category even with all its good intentions. There were several times where I unintentionally burst out laughing. I haven't read the novel, but this movie sure doesn't deserve to put up Mary Shelley's name and tarnish her reputation.4/10",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
74,shoobe01-1,"Too bonkers, too much for the format.",6,16 January 2020,"Really good to see a more authentic adaptation, but there's a hell of a lot going on for a single film. This is why we have adaptations, and trilogies. Edit, or negotiate for more.The Arctic wrapper is way too rushed for us to care about, is purely a wrapper, with no mid-film callouts so when it comes back it's very odd. And it was always about providing a tediously-explicit moralizing to the tale. We don't need it now, or we need it to be different than what was shown. Worst part of the whole thing.There's a LOT of time spent introducing us to Victor and Elizabeth, his house, his studies, the tragedy of his mother, etc.So much, that once you get past John Cleese's /extremely/ good and ponderous bit, the entire film feels rushed. It literally feels like it's a 6 part miniseries condensed to a film, that there are 20 minute expository chunks I am missing, and it gets more accelerated as it goes on.Some of the best parts of the middle-ish is a moderately faithfull telling of The Creature's Narrative, but it's interrupted, and too fast. He grows a lot here and having him just say ""I read your journal"" later is cheating. It's a film, show us!DeNiro is against type, and the makeup FX are great, but his performance is more stunt than great. Inconsistent. He breaks into sounding DeNiro here and there even.Branagh is about as good as he's ever been. Most acting is terrific, a few supporting roles seem to have not been worked out enough. Ian Holm is just sorta There, when he should be a force, not just on film but in Victor's life.Oh, and bonkers. It has segments of odd film work, quick cuts, vastly over the top amounts of blood, etc. The creature birthing scene I guess you'd call it looks like a gag reel as they fall down what, a dozen times?

75,jrfranklin01,An Abominable Science,7,12 September 2004,"Kenneth Branagh does a superb job acting and directing this film about a grisly consequence that was born from the industrial age of science. The young and unconventional Dr. Frankenstein (Branagh) challenges passe teachings of medicine in the hopes to uncover new and exciting methods to assist patients. But in his unsated struggle to discover and help lead a medical renaissance, he starts up the abandoned work of one of his professors who gave it up years ago because it lead to abomination. But Dr. Frankenstein refuses to listen to the cautions of his associates. He equips a laboratory and prepares himself to do the unimaginable - piece together a human being a bring it to life.Meanwhile Frankenstein is carrying on a relationship with his adopted sister, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), which I must admit was a bit disgusting, despite the accepted incestuous relationships during that time. When his experiment threatens his relationship with Elizabeth and threatens his own health, Frankenstein abandons the work, all but convinced that the abomination he created would perish on its own. But some horrible acts just never go away and soon come back to darken your door. And this is exactly what happens when ""The Monster"" (Robert De Niro) pays a visit to his maker. He demands to have a bride of his own, created just a he was, imperfect and grotesque so that he would not feel physically inferior or horrendous. When Frankenstein refuses, The Monster takes matters into his own hands in a gruesome act of vengeance.In the end, we see how some things once done, can never be undone. And how the consequences of what we do can disastrous effects. This film adds a bit of poetic justice to the quite believable acts of ""noble"" doctors who acted in the name of science without considering the morality and humane repercussions of their work.

76,Vampenguin,Good but flawed,7,18 June 2006,"I went into this with very few expectations, simply because I didn't know what to expect. I must say it turned out to be a decent flick, but rather hit-and-miss in places.The plot is a classic one, and it is handled very well here. The message is made quite obvious, and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, I do wish that they would have been more subtle about it. It also suffers from some very bad writing, with many very poor lines. Still, it's an interesting account of the story.The actors are, for the most part, very good. Branagh does a great job on both sides of the camera, but he really shines here as an actor. He does a fantastic job as Victor. As for DeNiro, I'm somewhat torn. He gave a great performance as the Creature, however I'm not sure that I liked how the character was portrayed. He was a very uneven character, who seemed to change his entire mindset on the drop of a dime. Perhaps this was intentional, but if so it wasn't handled very well.One thing that I rarely comment on about of movie is the score, though I feel the need to mention it here. A good, though generic, score, I was very annoyed at how intrusive it could be. It seemed very out of place most of the time.Finally, the pacing was very uneven. It moved along at a good clip most of the time, but was almost unbearably slow in the middle.Despite it's flaws, this is a pretty good film.

77,CountVladDracula,Good film but not as faithful to the novel as it likes to claim,8,1 November 2012,"This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim.2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled.3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark.4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out.If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature.Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies.My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it.2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known ""Bride of Frankenstein"" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature.3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie.4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie.5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described.6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
78,Tin Man-5,The greatest movie ever made!,10,2 May 1999,"I'm not kidding. ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" is the finest film ever made, and I think it should be ranked up there with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Casablanca,"" movies which have earned the right to be called masterpieces.It's an incredible film. Branagh takes the story of Frankenstein to a new level: the camera doesn't want to slow down, scenes are choppy, and a lot of it is so fast-moving, the viewer is left utterly confused. And that's the point Branagh was trying to make. The book was written from a nightmare, and Branagh was trying to film it so that it would come across as that: one long huge, nightmare. It works great.Branagh also inserts themes of child abandonment and warnings about trying to learn things about nature better left understood. In fact, he takes ever single aspect of the Shelley novel seriously, and because of this, he paints it in some vivid colors that no Frankenstein film has ever dared to do before. He takes the erotic sensuality of the novel seriously (probably inspired by Mary and Percy's own love affair), he takes the text seriously, and he takes the morals and values seriously. Morals that viewers can and will relate to.The camera angles and feverish soundtrack are awesome as well-- ""M.S. Frankenstein"" is beautiful film. The performances are also over-the-top. The biggest bow goes to DeNiro as the Creature, but Tom Hulce, Helena Bohnam Carter, Adian Quinn, and Branagh himself give top notch performances as well.All in all, this is the finest film ever made, and it is suitable for all tastes: horror, drama, or romance lovers should flock to see this.On a scale of one to ten, this film gets a three trillion.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
79,R_O_U_S,Underrated masterpiece,9,26 January 2004,"One of Branagh's more maligned works, though for the life of me I can't see why.  Sticking closer to the book than to any preconcieved notions of Boris Karloff (perhaps that's why), this injects true horror into the story of a medical student who brings a corpse to life.  If you don't like melodrama then maybe it's not the thing for you, but this deserves a far better reputation than it has.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
80,arturmachado-29588,Great Gothic ambiance,7,23 August 2017,"Another adaptation of the classic with great Gothic ambiance, an epic story (although it takes a little while at first to establish the introduction) and convincing performances. The scenery and costumes are stunning. Kenneth Branagh performs and plays the role of Dr. Victor Frankenstein; Robert De Niro has charisma as the Monster and Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth, the bride of Frankenstein - I never thought I'd say it - is very beautiful in this film. I think, however, that Branagh could have been more restrained in his acting and on the use of the rotating camera, or at least not to rotate it so quickly; moreover, during the end of the film the special effects did not convince me, taking a little of the immersion. Anyway, for those who like cinema with story and emotion I strongly recommend this movie; I think it's underrated, but also cannot give it more than 7/10.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Heck nobody ever talked about it or compared it to or mentioned it with Frankenstein of any period Nosferatu no Boris Karloff No not even Albert and Costello's version this movie is so gosh darn silly that it has been put back into the deepest darkest part of forget it ville Hollywood.Now Remember i'm watching this rat bait twenty years after it was made.man oh man some things get better with time but not DE Niro as Big Frank or should i say stanky Franky and then they tried to jam two Frankenstein movie's into one BY dragging the bride out. Wait one thing was better.Now i can see it digitally i can easily jump from space to space as i watched it.Well every real actor in Hollywood needs to have one classic monster film on the resume.I just saw the new 2014 Frankenstein that looks like a spin off of the underworld vampire sequels not much better than this just more smoke and mirrors.Well 20 long years have past you know every real actor in Hollywood needs at least one classic horror film on the resume.Well thank you Bobby De Niro and god bless you you have done it all and there is still more to come.,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
82,Danimal-7,Vastly underappreciated,10,24 August 1999,"The Frankenstein storyline is well familiar to most of us.  Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) makes a scientific breakthrough by which he can create a living creature from the pieces of the dead.  In this version, Frankenstein abandons his creation, thinking it dead, but it lives and follows him to seek its revenge for his uncaring treatment of it.All of the many good film treatments of the Frankenstein story depend on evoking the audience's sympathy for the Creature.  Frankenstein himself is usually portrayed as a gibbering madman or a callously evil genius.  The brilliance of Branagh's version is that it evokes sympathy for both the Creature and the Doctor.  Branagh's Frankenstein is a classic example of a man whose road to hell was paved with the best of intentions; he is a well-meaning physician whose ambition is to defeat death, and who fails to see the potential consequences until it is too late.  Branagh plays him with all the feverish intensity the role calls for.  DeNiro's Creature is not Karloff's child-in-a-man's-body, but more an adolescent with an adolescent's need for compassion and with an adolescent's rage at being rejected for his appearance.But the strength of the movie is not so much the characters as the energy and pacing as, slowly at first, then faster and faster, everything in Frankenstein's life falls to pieces, with his horror slowly growing as he realizes that it has all been his own fault.  Patrick Doyle's frenetic, pounding score adds immeasurably to this atmosphere of slowly building disaster.  Most of the camera shots are deliciously powerful: Frankenstein scaling a mountain in pursuit of his creation, the Creature as a black speck crossing a field of snow in search of his revenge, the Creature's bloodstained hand gripping a block of ice, the ecstasy of Frankenstein's culminating experiment.  Make no mistake, this movie is unapologetic, pulse-pounding entertainment.FRANKENSTEIN has been condemned as excessively gory.  It is not.  There are only two scenes that splash any appreciable amount of blood around.  By modern horror movie standards, the gore level is quite tame.This movie presents genuine, sympathetic characters that you can care about, in welcome contrast to the conventional interchangeable teen-age characters that appear in most horror movies for no apparent purpose other than to die. It is never slow or boring for a second.  I cannot explain its unpopularity except that apparently some people were expecting another HENRY V instead of this colorful, entertaining, and poignant take on the Frankenstein story.Rating: **** out of ****.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
83,malcp,"Die Monster , Die!",5,22 October 2012,"Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on ""significant"" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one.

84,raymond_chandler,Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein Will Live Forever,9,22 August 2015,"The Creature is arguably the single most recognized horror icon of the 20th Century, and I am referring specifically to the Karloff/James Whale/Jack Pierce Creature. Various actors of both great and obscure repute have assayed the role, but it belongs to Boris Karloff. This is incontestable. Karloff's iconic and definitive performance as the Creature is inextricably linked to the character itself throughout popular culture.My deal is that I really really like the Shelley novel, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein actually improves the closing chapters in a way that is unique, to my knowledge. It is remarkably faithful to the book most of the time. Frank Darabont shared a Saturn Award nomination for Best Writing with Steph Lady, who has only one other credit on IMDb. Patrick Doyle contributed a score that is by turns heroic, lighthearted, romantic, and chilling. It emphasizes the story with an amiable insistence that recalls the original music composed for the great silent films.People rip on Kenneth Branagh for his apparent egotism. Victor Frankenstein is an huge egotist. How else to explain his obstinate belief that he alone can defeat Death? Victor sacrifices everything he once held dear at the altar of vainglorious willfulness. I feel that Branagh's feverish direction gives epic material an operatic flair.The love story between Victor and Elizabeth is truly moving. Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter famously began a five-year romance during production that ended Branagh's marriage to Emma Thompson. Their infatuation is evident in the way Carter teases him playfully, and when Branagh gazes upon her rapturously. <<<<<<<<<< Start ""SPOILER"" >>>>>>>>>> IMO, the choice to have him revive Elizabeth and her to then take her own life is brilliant, and makes Darabont/Branagh's ending a complete inversion of Bride of Frankenstein's ending. Helena Bonham Carter's acting in these scenes is absolutely gut-wrenching. The ending so fried my circuits in the theater that I thought I was literally having an hallucination. It knocked me to the ground, kicked me, and then stuck a hot poker in my ear. I was scared and fascinated by what I was seeing THAT much. The film left me dazed, like after an excellent concert. <<<<<<<<<< End ""SPOILER"" >>>>>>>>>> That departure from the 1818 novel is what cinches Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as my favorite all-time adaptation, in spite of the flaws that I describe below.Downers are the head-scratching miscasting of De Niro (who does a fine job, nonetheless), and the decision to make the makeup realistic and understated as opposed to grotesque and terrifying. Branagh literally made everything in the movie larger than life except the Creature itself, which is the opposite of Shelley. I still adore the film regardless, and the scene where the Creature lures William with the flute is etched in my memory. ""Elizabeth...say my name.""",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

(I think Christopher Lee hated this movie and equally class-dripping Bram Stoker's Dracula because he felt that they were competing in the same area.) There's the classic monsters (Robert DeNiro!), the period sets, the lovely heroines in the lovely period costumes, the beautiful and suitably turbulent score...

Do you think movies are sometimes better than the book? Than this movie is for you. Never have I seen a more disturbingly terrible translation of book to movie than in this case. The acting was more than sub par, the scenery outlandish, and not for one second was it ever terrifying. These are the kind of movies you'd leave, or throw your popcorn at. The worst part about it all was that DeNiro's makeup and version of the Monster was promising, but cut short behind a muddle of boredom and sped up story, if only to put a beautiful book into two hours of over dramaticized slaughtering that only came to an end when the fast forward button or skip scene button would be pressed, just to get me out of the anger I felt towards specific scenes.See the original Frankenstein. Sure, it doesn't follow the book and is more based on a play than this version, but the acting is strong, and Karloff's monster, though silent, is a much more believable being.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
87,pettyfog,"Schizo school of film ""art""",4,13 January 2001,"While I don't think of Branagh as a ""Jackass"" as said by another reviewer, his directing of this film is surely an indicator of his ego.I havent even read a professional review of this yet and dont recall them but I can see what they didnt like about it.The medium of cinema is STILL about telling a story and Branagh set about trying to create ""Film Art"" without paying much attention to story line. He expects the audience to make assumptions and suspend disbelief while he plays on their ""esthetic tastes"" and emotional sides.Simply put, there are too many plotlines that don't make sense.  The father of the little girl chases the monster out tho it's obvious that he DIDNT hurt Grandfather, the villagers' lynching of the maid just because she had the boy's medal. Yet when Branagh sets off to kill the monster, on encountering him, sits down to a heart to heart with him. THEN he ignore's the monster's threats even after he has proved he kills for revenge.
Makes for cinematic ""beauty"" but as a storyline.. on a par with ""Killer Tomatos"".Yep, the professional reviewers were right, in fact the film is dreck. What a waste of acting talent, and it's all Director Branagh's fault.4 1/2 out of 10",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
88,pete36,Pretty bad,3,1 October 2016,"As much as I love Kenneth Branagh as an actor, most of the movies he directed leave quite a lot to be desired. This one is no exception : a near-hysterical version of the classic Frankenstein tale.Apparently the movie follows quite closely the original book by Mary Shelley (hence the title) but instead of a classic horror movie you get a version that most likely seems to be directed by Michael Bay. The swirling camera, the super fast editing, actors who do not talk but but shout the whole time as if they're on a stage, it all results in a head pain-inducing out-of-control carousel of flashy images and sounds.Francis Coppola, who was the producer, wasn't at all pleased with the finished product and even demanded to edit out the first half hour. Branagh didn't comply (he had better listened to the master)and the movie was released under The Zoetrope badge, instead of ""Frans Ford Coppola presents"". Whenever that happens it means that Coppola simply disavowed the movie as a whole.Branagh did go on to direct other movies with varying results including some (minor) successes like his monumental version of ""Hamlet"" and the swordandsorcery tale ""Thor"". But the rest of his directorial efforts (except his very first one ""Henry V"") is best to be forgotten. But he remains a brilliant actor !",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

After reading the novel and falling in love with the actual story, it occured to me that the old movie Frankenstein was very different then the original novel.

DeNiro was very good as the Wretch or Creature as it says in the credits. If you have read this book or want to get into Frankenstein see this movie along with the original Frankenstein movie I feel this is a strong movie and is very well done. the acting is superb if you liked the original chances are you will enjoy this.

91,joliefille411,"Seriously, what were they thinking?",1,26 April 2007,"Wow, this film is so inaccurate on so many levels. I read the book in 12th grade, and I can't say I liked the story, but that is not my beef with this movie. Why call it MARY SHELLY'S Frankenstein if its not based on her novel? The inclusion of the author's name implies more accuracy, not less.Okay, why is Frankenstein dancing on the mountains with his half-sister and a lightening pole? He was a medical student because of his mothers death, not a random science enthusiast. His mother also died from illness, not childbirth. Frankenstein's friend Henry was from his hometown, not his school. And why did Kenneth Branagh feel the need to slick himself up in goo for the monster-making scene? Also, there was no need for the sex scene, unless it was just to ""spice up"" the movie, as Frankenstein and Elizabeth never had a chance to consummate their marriage. And what was with the whole trial-gone-awry!?? It was supposed to be an unfair trail, not a mob-gone-mad and throwing the girl off a cliff. Why was the monster going to secret meetings in ice caves? But the MOST ridiculous part was when Frankenstein tried to regenerate Elizabeth. She's DEAD and should stay that way! Why could he not make the one girl with the perfectly fine body come to life, but magically when he hacks off her head and stick's on his lovers, she sparks to life. And was it necessary to shave half her head in the process? The longer this movie went on, the more i just wanted to laugh. It went so far off base, it shouldn't have even been called Frankenstein, let alone dared to include the author's name as if she'd given personal approval. Unless of course, he knew it was so far removed, people wouldn't recognize and confuse it with Bob Smith's Frankenstein.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

His portrayal is also more educated than most. Kenneth Branagh brought artistic flair to this incarnation, and has stood the test of time. Its an excellent drama.

93,spencejoshua-22736,Almost a great film!,6,17 September 2020,"This film is so far removed from the book that it only makes sense to critique it on its own merit. The amount of work that Kenneth Branagh poured into this project was huge. Directing and starring in a film with such a large scope. His portrayal as Victor Frankenstein was specifically interesting. I thought he would be more solemn, unapproachable or insane , but Branagh decided to go with a very melodramatic character instead. At times this flamboyant figure retracted from the story. Actually, most of the characters had a similar personality and delivery. It was more like watching a play.The film felt a little long to me. I'm thinking that too much footage from Victor's younger years was included. Everything seemed rushed. Even the delivery of the script came across as rushed. The screenplay had holes......some of the plot didn't fit together as well as it should have.Fortunately, I did enjoy Robert De Niro's performance as the monster. The cinematography, the sets and filming locations were all great. There were some unique images. I believe my favorite was when the reanimated Elizabeth set herself on fire and ran through the mansion. I thought that was phenomenal.Overall, it was a decent film that was almost a great film. I would watch it again.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
94,two-rivers,The Folly of Progress,8,8 January 2006,"Kenneth Branagh wanted to create a more faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel, but it is far from being accurate. Too often he lets himself guide by pure sensationalism, he seems convinced that by filming more spectacular scenes than to be found either in the original novel or in the earlier film versions, he will attract a wide mass audience and thus push through his ideological message.For instance Justine, the servant girl adopted by the Frankenstein family, is convicted without a trial and spectacularly hanged by a furious mob, pushing her downwards from a high building with her head tied to a rope. There is not even time to interview her, whereas in the novel she is forced to confess and sentenced to death in spite of passionate appeals by Victor and Elizabeth. However, the Branagh treatment does not seem to make much sense in terms of character development, as Justine has not been convincingly introduced into the film plot. She just has not had enough scenes before as to have become really known to the movie audience, and therefore her violent death won't cause too much emotional involvement.A reasonable condensation of events and the omission of apparently superfluous details is a major problem in any adaptation of huge literary works. Branagh chose to cut down considerably the period of time that the Creature spends in the pigsty hiding from his host family near Ingolstadt. These people are now just poor peasants, and by no means French noblemen on the refuge, as in Shelley's version. And the attractive Arab lady, in love with young Felix, obviously has to disappear altogether from the plot.The idea of Branagh was, of course, not to concentrate too much on the fate of the Creature but to highlight the folly of the scientist instead. And, indeed, to strike out at scientific progress as a whole. ""Did you consider the consequences of your actions?"" is one of the key questions the Creature asks a befuddled Frankenstein. Of course, he did not think about it all, he was just overwhelmed by his desire to overcome death, following the sad loss of his mother. The same way, innumerable scientists of the recent history, not only in the field of genetic engineering, might be carried away by the emotional impact of their inventions and discoveries without reflecting on possible ill effects.Warning about the dangers of genetic modification might be one concern of the film. However, Kenneth Branagh has much more on his mind. This is proved by the inclusion of the ""Arctic frame"", not fully understood by some critics (""the movie is bracketed with an unnecessary prologue and epilogue"", says even Roger Ebert). Here an explorer is heading north on his attempt to be the first man at the Pole. He is so determined that even an impending mutiny by his crew cannot put him off. It is only after having heard Victor's story and after having seen the hideous Creature with his own eyes that his mind slowly illuminates. He has seen to what folly the unleashed forces of scientific progress can lead to. The funeral pyre on the ice, in which the Creature burns his life away, finally leads to his decisive insight: the men must sail home instead of striving onwards. The same should be said to modern science and its followers.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

It offered a great story, and finale which lacks in most movies.I loved the Lon Chaney ""Frankenstein"", and loved this one too!  DeNiro was interestingly cast as the monster.  Branagh as Dr. Frankenstein was the most engaging of all, being devastated by deaths all around him and wanting to stop death.  It's really a story of playing God, but also having the ability and intelligence to do it ---- and to have the intelligence to see it was not the greatest decision ever made.  It's just a love story, bottom line. Wouldn't we want to bring someone back from the dead so we can spend more time with them?  Branagh never got the credit he deserved for this movie.

103,theblackscythe,A Head scratching Rendition of a Master Work From An Otherwise Acclaimed Filmmaker,1,11 May 2014,"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is among the most influential books on modern culture ever. It is most widely remembered for the 1931 James Whale adaptation, an undisputed masterpiece. There have been several other adaptations of the novel, notably the series produced by ""Hammer Films"". Kenneth Brahnagh is a beloved director known for his adaptations of Shakespeare's plays, he is also generally loved for his work.So why does this film fail on every worthwhile level? Well...Firstly, it is clear that the romantic style of Mary Shelly's novel is out of Brahnagh's comfort zone for a start. Frankenstein is a hard book to adapt as it is mainly told through first person narration. In addition this narration is long winded and (unlike the timeless writing of Shakespeare) is a clear product of the era, likely seeming ridiculous and overindulgent to modern viewers. Therefore the vehemently loyal adaptation of the novel, characteristic of Brahnagh, fails to work and leads to some ridiculous scenarios. James Whale correctly overhauled the books plot, only leaving the initial concept and key themes intact, to fit the story to the medium of film. Brahnagh does not, to unintentionally hilarious effect.'Brother and Sister no longer' Elizabeth moans on her wedding night to her husband. I cannot believe this line was kept in the film, or written in to begin with.Despite this however, Brahnagh chooses to detail the creation of the creature, unlike the text. This is done in hilariously overblown fashion, complete with tacky womb symbolism and logic bending plot-holes (how he move that equipment into his small apartment? How did he keep the eels fed and alive? Did he need help? etc.). This, to me, shows a lack of understanding of the subtlety of the novel and a desire for forced visual flair, ruined by the poor and jumbled production design throughout the film.The acting and script are also appalling. I have given the most glaring example of the horrid script, however this issue is present throughout the running time. The acting exacerbates the issue. Brahnagh is also out of his depth in terms of acting in the title role, with a lack of emotional depth and unconvincing facial expression. The supporting and background actors are similarly weak. The elephant in the room however is Robert De Niro as the creature itself. This is among the most egregious examples of miscasting ever. De Niro's charisma is buries under make-up, his personal flair and improvised dialogue (best seen in his collaborations with Martin Scorsese has clearly been removed by Brahnagh as to not interfere with his vision/loyalty to the text. De Niro is not a particularly physical actor, in terms of portraying animal-esk movements and communicating with little dialogue, and his expressions fail compared to the legendary Boris Karloff. In short, the acting is a trainwreck onscreeen.In conclusion, it is clear that this film was a misguided disaster. Bragnagh went on to better work, the Whale version remains better remembered, the novel is still a classic, and De Niro's career was quickly placed back on track by Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.This film is little more than a foot note in the histories of all these icons, defiantly for the best. 1/10.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
104,averjee,More than a simple genre flick,7,25 March 1999,"Well-filmed adaptation of May Shelley's novella, with Kenneth Branagh's trademark broad cinematic strokes, vital camera motions and visual flair.A lot of people didn't appreciate it for what it was - not a campy horror film like previous versions of the book, but a pretty faithful adaptation of it, full of grand philosophizing and romantic idealism.Robert De Niro is the troubled Creature, and Branagh is the obsessed Dr. Frankenstein who is eventually reviled by his blasphemous creation. Frankly, I didn't understand why Dr. Frankenstein would so quickly turn against the usefulness of the daring scientific method that allows him to achieve a scientific breakthrough of Promoethean propoetions. Part of the problem is that Branagh makes the doctors who object to creating a new life seem like old fuddy-duddies - you can't help but sympathize with Frankenstein's goals. So why Frankenstein tries to wipe out the Creature, rather than fixing its defects, is unclear.The film is feverish and florid, with more heart than head, but largely succeeds in bringing an engaging visual excitement to the story.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Instead, we are confronted with a never-ending set of silly face-masks. That the guy had been stitched together from a variety of sources could still be somehow explained. Though, a good doctor like Victor could have done better. Plus: Is there no healing of scarfs over time? Obviously, there was someone here infatuated by ugly masks. And more illogical: the complete, beautiful, Elisabeth completely hacked up and stitched together again in a harrowing style. For no other reason than to make her live again?Even the captain, depicted as a mindless crack had second thoughts. Why did nobody stop Branagh from messing up a potential master piece?",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
106,Erichnathanbennett,This Frankenstein movie has a lot of meaning,7,19 July 2010,"This movie really did surprise me. My friend told me it was really scary. I watched and I thought how can a creature who can barely walk, always holds his arms out, and always yells when he's approaching someone so it'll give them a chance to run away (based on the old Frankenstein movie). I did not expect the creature be able to run, have super strength, and talk. After I saw this I learned that this movie was based off the book. That this movie is a closer description of what the book is than the older one. And I'm afraid that the original Frankenstein with the bulb on his head filled with electricity, the nails in his neck, and even one of the most famous lines ever ""It's alive,"" isn't in the book. It was all Hollywood at work. So trust me with better effects and it actually being true to the book this movie is way better than the original.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

To someone else they may say, for a 20s horror flick everything was executed just fine, as for me and growing up in a different era it lacked everything that makes a horror movie in my understanding. A horror movie to me is more intense, more off screen gut twisting scenes. I felt because Frankenstein didn't have the qualities of a Jason movie or a van helsing movie it didn't reach my interest. Now, if I had to think of a part that was interesting it will be when the man walked down the street with his lifeless daughter in his hand.

Watching him as the Monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a real treat. He remains recognizably Bobby De Niro, but he manages to bring to the part nuances of emotion---and aggression---that are utterly different from his other work, before and since.Alas, the rest of the film (plot, script, acting) is exactly the sort of thing that has put us to sleep in innumerable mawkish Victorian romances and melodramas. With some careful pick-and-choosing, and despite a good dash of Hollywood, the plot is acceptably close to Mary Shelley's novel, but creating a compelling cinematic version of the novel is a different matter. De Niro has, maybe, 20 minutes onscreen. 'Tain't enough. Best line: ""Don't bother to scream.""Add one full ratings point for Kenneth Branagh's earnest effort to avoid giving this movie a feel-good ending. Subtract half a point for failing.

112,blowfly13,NOT Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,3,3 April 2011,"Oh my. Again I ask, why do Hollywood writer have the hubris to think they can improve on the classics? I suppose this awful movie is CLOSER to Mary Shelley's book than usual, but the changes just completely ruin it.One huge problem is Elizabeth. In the book she is a minor character, and passive, and quiet. I guess because Elizabeth is played by the ubiquitous Helena Bonham Carter, the writers felt that they had to turn her into a fiesty independent woman who takes on a role nearly equal to Victor's. It's not a good change. The very worst part is what Victor does with her at the end - this most assuredly was NOT in the book, and it's just gratuitously disgusting. Since the movie is billed specifically as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, enormous changes in plot are just massively irritating.Another huge and ruinous change is that in the movie, Victor actually accepts responsibility and feels remorse for what he has done. One of the main contributors to the extreme pathos of the book is that Victor does NOT accept responsibility, and he does NOT feel remorse, in any noticeable way. He hates the creature. He has no sympathy for it. In the movie, Victor is given a good reason for not making the monster's companion. In the book, Victor creates the companion for the monster, then rips her apart in front of the monster, because he feels the monster is evil - which of course he would not have been, had Victor not abandoned him from the beginning. I guess the idiot Hollywood writers felt Victor needed to be humanized, but they were wrong. In the book, the true monster IS Victor. In the movie, there is no monster. There's just a guy who made an unfortunate mistake.The casting of Robert DeNiro was terrible. It would have been better to use someone unknown. DeNiro just isn't good at this role; he just doesn't fit. Also you're aware the whole time that it IS DeNiro, which is distracting.All in all, just a really awful movie. If you want to know Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, you'll have to read the book. Bring tissues, as you will be much more moved than you could ever be by this silly flick.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Thankfully he avoided the excessively philosophically thinking, eloquent and educated monster that was utterly incredible in the original book, but the one moment of reflection between him and Frankenstein in the ice-cave simply did not ring true. There was a poor understanding of the big screen. And some ridiculously comic moments that were too staged. See Bonham Carter running across the lawn to meet Frankie's horse, just makes you ask why he did not ride up to the house? Then after the monster has harvested the field of turnips, the camera pans to De Nero's face in - to let us all know who did it - just looks so pantomime and silly.

The birth scene is ridiculous and the endless jump cuts as Branagh tries to manhandle Deniro's bloody naked body...laugh out funny. And I'm a fan of KB's work. But this humorless and jumbled attempt at gussing up the original is a missed opportunity. Deniro does as good as can be expected under the uninspiring stitched make up, but he's still Bobby Deniro as The Monster. Why not stick to Mary Shelly's story?

I think it was slightly ahead of it's time and, if it came out today, it would be widely celebrated. This film is a great adaptation of Mary Shelley's unforgettable tale of playing God. Unlike it's predecessors, the monster is not a monster, there are no bolts in his neck just scarred flesh. The ""monster"" of this film is made quite human by De Niro who plays the part with the curiosity and innocence of a child. The ability to make the audience sympathize with such a grotesque character is an enormous feat and that alone makes this film respectable. It's actually difficult to decide who to root for at times. Then there's the special effects which are, for the most part, excellent. The climactic fire sequence still amazes me when I watch it. This films only downfall in my eyes, is it's over dramatization of events. Sometimes you find yourself thinking, OK, calm down enough is enough it's just too over-the-top.

122,JadeEagle224,"Starts off so perfectly, then, suddenly, goes astray. (Spoilers)",7,19 January 2003,"Kenneth Branagh took on quite a challenge with this film: How do you top the original movie which, while it hardly captured Mary Shelley's book, was so well made for its time?  And, how do you overcome the fact that, for over 60 years, your audience has been ingrained with the image of a bolted-templed, grunting monster as professor Frankenstein's creation, rather than Shelley's patch-work man?  Kenneth Branagh's solution is perfect: leave the old classic behind, and instead, follow the book.  If only he had followed through until the end, this movie could have been spectacular. 
Unfortunately, Branagh took artistic license with the ending, and flawed his masterpiece.  But, the rest of the movie was too good to be completely overlooked because of a bad ending.  I love Branagh's portrayal of Professor Frankenstein.  He is brilliant, passionate, and sometimes visceral. Handsome, in a scruffy sort of way (I never did buy the squeaky-clean, neat Frankenstein).  I have always admired the talent of the classically-trained Branagh.  DeNiro stepped out of his typical mobster character to play a Creature (*not* monster) which is the closest portrayal I have seen to Mary Shelley's creation.  I was actually impressed with DeNiro's performance because he was able to disguise himself.  When I heard he was cast as the Creature, I half-expected the mobster DeNiro to appear.  Luckily, he did not.  And, yes, you sympathized with the Creature.  He was created, then discarded to survive without guidance.  An ugly quilt of a man.  I enjoyed the chemistry between Frankenstein and Elizabeth.  Their love is very believable.  I'm glad they chose to delve into the development of the relationship from adoptive brother and sister to lovers.  This movie (until the end) is darkly and beautifully rich in Mary Shelley's writings.
At one point, I say Branagh even improved upon Shelley's work.  The character Justine is wrongfully accused of murder.  In the book, to prevent further discord, she is forced to falsely admit her guilt and is hanged. Branagh turned this instead into a lynching by an angry mob in the heat of the moment.  A much more acceptable scenario, in my opinion.  
But, just as the audience is swept away but the brilliance of the film, after Elizabeth is killed, the movie loses its way.  As I watched, I remember mentally screaming, ""No! No! You were doing so well!  Stay with the book!""  I was very disappointed with the conclusion of this work of art. That having been said, this is still an intelligent, very well made movie. You'll appreciate it more if you've read the book.  My rating:  7/10, because it was a fabulous movie sans ending.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

124,ferretpossum,The Hallmark Channel Would Be Proud,4,26 September 2005,"Good lord. With Francis Ford Coppola, Kenneth Branagh and Robert De Niro on board I think we could have expected better than this movie, seemingly stitched-together as badly as the monster himself from snippets from Mary Shelley's novel, snippets from the 30's movies and snippets from the Hallmark movie of the week.Yes, the production values and the style is as hackneyed as anything you'd see on that channel between 1 and 4pm any weekday. The sets are as stagey as you'd expect from someone who's trodden the boards as often as KB, but what I didn't expect was the overwrought acting and frankly awful scripting from Frank Darabont (of Shawshank Redemption).Take the creation scene - surely a set-piece of the movie and pivotal in that we should see Victor move from triumph at his successful experiment to horror in what he's created. It goes like this... Victor breaks open the creation chamber, frees the monster and the two of them spend a good minute slipping and falling over in amniotic goop like Stan and Ollie after a pie-fight. Then (somehow) the monster gets tangled up in the washing line (or something) and is hoist to the ceiling. It is at this point the Victor undergoes his conversion from uber-scientist to moralistic buffoon IN FIVE SECONDS FLAT. ""What have I DONE?"" he wails.My reaction was this: What brought THAT on?? The monster doesn't kill anyone, he doesn't smash anything, he's no uglier than when Victor stitched him together - why does Frankenstein suddenly turn against his creation? The answer folks, is because the story calls for it and the screenwriter was too lazy to explain why. This is the sort of thing that leads me to reach for the fast forward button.The story from then on is pretty predictable, apart from the plot elements that are too daft for words. The monster demands a mate, so Victor makes him one out of his own dead girlfriend, causing a rather obvious love triangle. Why? Because the story called for it and the screenwriter was... oh never mind, you get the idea.I'm making it sound worse than it really is. It's not AWFUL. When the monster and Victor debate in an ice-chasm it reaches into the philosophical core of the book, which has never really been attempted before. However, it's too little, too late - by that time I was already bored. Better to go back to the book, or even better to James Whales' movies - what they lacked in faithfulness to the book they at least made up for with imagination - something sorely lacking here.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
125,Spanner-9,"Engaging, thoughtful film.",9,8 January 2001,"**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS WHAT MAY BE DEFINED AS SPOILERS**This film is made by the incredibly powerful performances of Robert DeNiro and Kenneth Branagh. They bring an intelligent style to not a  simple gore-fest horror story but a relevant and symbolic questioning of an age-old philisophical problem: Should science take the place of God?Branagh brings his own style to the role of Victor Frankenstein with great effect-he is a sympathetic character who has the best of intentions but does not understand the complexities of his actions until it is too late. But it is Oscar-winner DeNiro that steals the show as the pitiful creature. He has a commanding screen presence as well as a yearning, inquisitive look that virtually demands empathy. The days of a flat-headed giant with bolts in its head are over and this creature is much more believable (for lack of a better word). The creature is (as one user stated in a previous review) almost like an adolescent. It needs guidence and understanding. The scene which depicts the creature taking refuge in the barn of a family is one of the most memorable of the movie. The only person that the creature can relate to is the only one that listens-a kindly old blind man, until it is chased off by the man's son.On top of all of this, Branagh's direction is, as always, impeccable. He captures the mood of Shelley's novel. The music and photography combine to create the intensity which is one of this film's many distinguishing features.Mention must be made of the fine supporting performances. Helena Bonham Carter is mesmerising as Elizabeth. Ian Holm, Aidan Quinn and John Cleese also provide reliable perfomances.If you are looking for a gore-fest, this film is not for you.

128,nymeria-meliae,Shouldn't be called Mary Shelley's,4,22 October 2015,Nothing like the book so why call it Mary Shelley's? Victor Frankenstein is primarily a chemist and keeps the process of animating a body secret. There are no dead body parts and there is no electricity in the books. Rather it is suggestive that the body is created by Victor and the animation process is a chemical process rather than electrical process... although it does not say for certain how the 'monster' is constructed.This film owes more to early Hollywood and Hammer than it does to Mary Shelley. Also my impression of Victor Frankenstein in the books is that he is an incredibly private person. The 'monster' is created by himself over a long period of time and in deep secrecy and after its creation Victor becomes even more withdrawn in himself. I felt that this film does not portray Victor in this light. By all means keep the film's original title as Frankenstein as a homage to the films of old but to make arrogant claims that it resembles the book suggests to me that the director or the studio officials who decided to change the name to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein have not read the book but instead have relied on watching the earlier film versions of the story.,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
129,that_ealing_feeling,Too faithful for its own good,4,30 October 2008,"Like its near-contemporary Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein achieves the impressive feat of being every bit as dull as its source novel. It may well be the most faithful/least unfaithful version ever filmed (which isn't saying much), but what it's faithful to, in mood and spirit if not always in detail, is one of the dreariest examples of the unreadably dreary Gothic novels of the early 19th century. It aims at seriousness, but reaches only a solemn kind of silliness; lacking any sense of the ridiculous, it often stumbles into unintentional hilarity. Long-winded dialogue, eccentric casting and pedestrian cinematography - there isn't a single shot that would make a still worth framing - all contribute their lifeless parts to a monster that should never have been made. The unpretentious but supremely cinematic Universal Frankensteins of the 1930s and 1940s offer much more entertainment, not to mention art and even poetry, than this crashing bore of a film.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
130,JSmith125,"The reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein""",6,28 October 2012,"Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein."" It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of ""Frankenstein."" For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be ""inspired by"" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong.The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's ""ugly,"" as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more ""traditional"" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better.There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of ""Frankenstein.""

Although based on one of the all time greatest 'releasing the inner human monster' and 'pay for your affronts to God' stories, the movie was merely an expensive costume drama like those being produced by the dozen at BBC's studios. Almost every frame of the movie is composed in a theatrical style and so much effort is put into making everything looking perfect that most of the times it just looks silly. Like the way the lab is set up: Nobody (except a movie character and maybe Willy Wonka) would make such a stupidly intricate transport system for the simple task of getting a 100 kg item into a tub. (And for the record: This is a poorly built loft, still no one cares when the floor i flooded by huge washes of water.) Or the drape of Elisabeth flowing (like that of Drakula) when being carried up the stairs, even though they had raced back by horse becoming moist and roughened (and no way the fabric was even big enough to flow like that). These are just a few of many examples throughout the film.For most of the movie, the acting and the characters are OK, that is when they are not overacting into parody. Something that is a bit too frequent. At times it seems obvious that parts are missing, and there is also a poor balance between making boring scenes way too long and shortening the more interesting events. It seems like the film has been cut way too heavily.

135,oldbollweevil,Why do people resent Kenneth Branagh so much?,7,2 July 2001,"**WARNING:  CONTAINS SPOILERS**I've never been able to understand why people resent Kenneth Branagh so much.  To my mind, he's a fine actor, a very good director, and his failures in each area are more than made up for by his ambition--when he screws up it's because he's tried for something magnificent that proves to be just out of his reach.  As opposed to most people, who can screw up on things that aren't worth achieving in the first place.  But there seem to be a lot of people that just hate Branagh--that go out of their way to be annoyed by him.  I just don't get it. This film was produced by Francis Coppola and American Zoetrope, and his Dracula cohort James V. Hart, and it shares that movie's aim of trying to make a film true to the literary spirit and themes of the original novel.  That said, in feel and approach it's very much Kenneth Branagh's movie.  In place of the baroque immersion in setting and atmosphere that Coppola usually brings to a project (particularly Dracula), we get the fantastic energy that Branagh pours into his work. It really is the first Frankenstein movie to capture the Romantic spirit of Shelley's book.  The frequent appearance of fire (especially the scene of the monster holding aloft the torch at the end) remind one of the book's subitle:  The Modern Prometheus. And Branagh's portrayal of Victor embodies all the promise and hubris of Shelley's protagonist. And at the same time, the film manages to be a really good Gothic horror flick, too.  The lab setup is wonderfully imagined--everything one could want from a mad scientist's lab circa 1794--and some of the scenes are among the weirdest and most horrifying ever filmed.  Horrifying in the old-school sense, the feeling that you're watching Something That Should Not Be.  I'm thinking of Victor's weird dance in the amniotic fluid with the newly reanimated monster, still unable to stand.  It goes on forever, while the viewer becomes more and more aghast at what is being shown.  Then there's the climax, where he reanimates his bride, and the viewer realizes he's truly gone mad. The movie manages that rare trick of being two things at once:  an intellectually satisfying literary movie and a ripping good adventure Performances:  Branagh's great.  Helena Bonham-Carter is also superb--her post-reanimation scene alone is worth the price of admission.  She must have had a lot of fun doing that.  Tom Hulce is fantastic as usual in a bit part.  And John Cleese is astoundingly good in his cameo. The only real problem with this movie is Robert DeNiro. Physically, he's perfect for the role--a more monstery-looking Frankenstein's monster you couldn't ask for.  But once he learns to speak, it's Brooklyn, and it just about ruins the movie.  For this film to work the monster has to be alternately horrifying and poetic--you have to believe that under all those scars and stitches is a sensitive, wounded soul.  But every time DeNiro speaks it sounds like he's saying ""You lookin' at me?!"" even if he isn't.  The accent ruins it.  The monster's utterances are essential to the book, but I think it would have been preferable in the movie to have him remain mute, rather than let DeNiro speak. If you can get around that, though, it's a fine movie. 7/10",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
136,B_a_S_t_A_r_D,Underwhelming,4,12 August 2006,"Branagh's Frankenstein, for all of its flaws and imperfections, is undeniably interesting. Given Branagh's history and Shakespearian background, it is surprising that his adaptation of Mary Shelley's pioneering sci fi horror is orchestrated the way it has been. Infamous for his incredibly accurate and rear-numbingly long interpretation of ""Hamlet,"" Kenneth Branagh isn't a name usually associated with making changes and taking dramatic liberties with film adaptations of classic works. In ""Frankenstein,"" this is exactly what he has done. Some of the changes are indeed welcome. Victor Frankenstein's obsession with his ""project"" is well played out by Branagh, and the addition of a strain on his relationship with Elizabeth is a dramatic necessity. Most of Shelley's formal, almost poetic dialogue has been discarded in favour of a more realistic sounding script, unfortunately likely to cater for the less literature - orientated of audiences. Nevertheless, this works well and compliments the late eighteenth century set piece to a high degree. It makes the film more believable and the characters more susceptible to empathy whereas a direct script may not have worked in a film for mainstream audiences. Whilst these and other changes are minor and do not harm the adaptation with artistic license, there are too many key omissions and additions that do just that. In the sequence wherein Robert De Niro's ""Creature"" begins learning human abilities such as reading, communication and emotion, the ever so relevant works of literature which he reads in the novel are absent. In Shelley's text, the Creature reads ""Paradise Lost,"" a novel telling the story of Adam and Eve's struggle upon leaving Eden into the imperfect real world. The parallels between Adam from ""Paradise Lost"" and ""Frankenstein's"" Creature are many. Both have been forced into the world by a creator who has turned his back on them, Frankenstein in the eponymous novel, and God in ""Paradise Lost"". Both must learn to adapt to this new world whilst struggling to come to terms with their harsh dismissal from that of their birth givers. While not essential to the plot, a nod to that work of literature would have been welcome. Also missing, and far more damaging to Branagh's doomed movie, is the tremendous sense of loss and loneliness that drives the novel. In Shelley's text, Victor often reflects on the passing of a better life and the doom and gloom that his failed experiment has brought him. He loses all his cherished loved ones in such a short time and it completely destroys his spirits. Branagh made a fatal error in omitting this, one which renders the character of Victor as less amiable than he could have been and ultimately severs the emotion this film creates. Whilst (despite the dismissal of certain themes and sub plots) ""Frankenstein"" is somewhat a faithful adaptation, the ""Wedding Night"" sequence takes huge liberties and is completely unnecessary. Victor barely mourns his wife's death (which, prior to the reanimation, is extremely faithful to the book) before chopping her to pieces in order to bring her to life. This scene, completely absent from Shelley's novel, is clearly done for no other reason than to shock audiences. The idea that Victor would spend his life married to a living corpse is repulsive. Shelley's Victor would not consider this, seeing as he regards his creation as a ""Demon."" It is an utterly ridiculous ending, although it does highlight the issue of who the real evil is. Surely Victor cannot assume his creation is evil if he is willing to marry a similar creation. Ridiculous ending aside, the film could have been saved by strong performances from its lead players. Unfortunately, excluding Branagh, these are not present. Tom Hulce is almost emotionless and undesirable as Henry Clerval, who Shelley intended as an optimistic and joy bringing presence whose death (again completely left out in this interpretation) utterly cripples Victor emotionally. Helena Bonham Carter's Elizabeth is also unconvincing, failing to strike empathy and sympathy into audiences, whilst De Niro's curiously Italian - American Creature is underwhelming and gives the impression that De Niro is having as much fun playing the creature as we are watching him. Overall, ""Frankenstein's"" under-performing leads, glaring omissions and unnecessary additions (not to mention atrocious lighting and a ridiculously out of place soundtrack) make this film almost impossible to enjoy or indeed take seriously. Unfortunately, seriousness is exactly what makes the Novel so impacting.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
137,Roberto Lorenz,Circulatory disturbance!What's new?,5,21 February 2002,"Firstly: You feel Mary Shelley and her novel when you watch this movie. But this is not as favorable as it seem.The set-decoration and the costumes are too sterile and face.Helena Bonham Carter's hair style...should she be the monster?Sometimes the dialogues are schmaltzy and exaggerated: Frankenstein's ""Bring her back!"" at the beginning; Henry's ""No!"" after Elizabeth's rebirth; Captain Walton's ""Home"" at the end;... How obtrusive and sentimental.But there are a few masterful scenes, for example the moments when Justine hangs or Frankenstein gives birth to his dead Elisabeth. The power of this scenes succeed through the excellent string-addicted musical score. It gives ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" its face. Patrick Doyle's soundtrack is beautiful, haunting and thrilling. Almost too good for this film.The end? It is worn, but -fortunately- there is one. This film gets the same standpoint like all the other Frankenstein-movies and the novel: A human being should not play God. Wow!But if Mary Shelley or Kenneth Branagh make such commandments, don't they play God?Thanks",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
138,NorthEgg,awful... just awful,1,26 October 2003,"This was the first Frankenstein movie I've ever watched, and lucky me, I got to see the one directed by the most egomaniacal overacting ugly and untalented man that England has ever produced... that's right, Mr. Branagh. Ever noticed how he plays the lead in ALL of his movies? And since he couldn't play Othello, for obvious reasons, he played Iago!
That aside, the movie lacked in many other areas. Pieces of the plot, for instance. Must've run away when they saw the director... It's like he tried to squeeze an entire, well developed novel (and it's questionable as to whether the novel was well developed at all) into a 2 hour movie.
And the melodrama! It was almost as if I was watching a soap opera. Too much of the cliche ""As God is my witness, I'll never let another human die again!"" People talking to themselves, reading out loud as they're writing letters, lack of narration... these are all very amateur directoral choices. ""Hmmm, can't think of a way to get the plot across, so I'll have my characters just say it out loud!"" Very, very poor.So, between Kenneth Branagh's ugly mug, plot holes, and horribly acted melodrama, this movie is a BIG loser. At least I didn't pay for it. It came on cable.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
139,nevsky41,What was Brannagh on when he made this?,2,5 June 2004,"I cannot begin to express how awful this movie is. The entire thing feels like a train gone out of control. Brannagh uses bizarre camera moves, slams on the gas for some scenes and floors the brake for others, making the movie feel very disjointed and very stop and go. Unnecessary usage of the fish-eye lens also shows up for no apparent reason at least once to my recollection.
Brannagh completely ignores the entire idea of exposition and just throws things at the audience and hopes we don't question them. Examples - Where did Victor get what had to be about 100 gallons of amniotic fluid? And how did he keep them viable while accumulating them? What was the point of lightning experiment? (It seems thrown out there for no real reason.) How does Victor get to the Creature's location of the mountaintop while keeping his hair perfectly coiffed? How did he climb that mountain in such a short amount of time? If he never intended to use it again, why did he move his equipment back to the house, and why have an elaborate pulley system already installed for it? How did he get another 100 gallons of amniotic fluid when he flips out and decides to resurrect Elizabeth? Since there was no real damage to Elizabeth's head, why did he stitch her face up? Also, not really a question, but the electric eels took me three viewings to understand what they were supposed to be; very poor explanation of a key plot element. Also, the climax with Elizabeth being reanimated, and subsequently igniting herself, is easily one of the dumbest scenes ever filmed.Just a bad movie all around. The only thing that is watchable is the Creature's speech in the ice cave, but I can never sit through the movie to get to that point. DeNiro is completely wasted with a godawful script and director. Had Francis Ford Coppola directed this, maybe it could have been better executed, along the lines of his ""Dracula"" film, two years earlier. As it is, DeNiro's performance is the only saving grace to this mess, and really, after the ice cave speech, DeNiro's performance is boiled down to angry grumbles and bled of any semblance of the intellect he shows in the ice cave speech. A complete waste of America's greatest actor.Also, though John Cleese's role is not intended to be humorous, he seems like he stepped right out of a Monty Python sketch. (The monkey's hand doesn't help.) Ian Holm is wasted as well, as is Tom Hulce, who seemed to think he was still playing Mozart. Overall, an awful bit of drek that has a few flashes of quality provided by DeNiro, but the movie ultimately collapses under the weight of it's own stupidity and frantic, out-of-control-train pace.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
140,richardscd,Another Great Film from Kenneth Branagh,7,4 March 2004,"While many people seem to scorn this film, I found it wonderfully enjoyable.  Like the great Orson Welles, He stars in, and directs, many of his movies.  This one in particular shows some of his more excentric, if not marketable, passions in filmmaking that make movie buffs and connaisseurs alike enjoy this stylized and emotional film.Yes, it is melodramatic.  Yes, the acting is often over the top.  But what many critics of this film fail to recognize is that this is precisly the point.  By staying very true to the source material(until the Elizabeth thing) and the significant changes that WERE made are clear evidence of this.  The book was melodramatic.  What Kenneth Branagh does here is stay true to the spirit of the classic gothic novel.  The great close-ups define the characters, and through them you can understand them.  Do not mistake stylization for poor film-making, because this is a wonderfully made and presented film, that if understood captivates you from the first spoken words(a quote from Mary Shelly, setting up the stylization) to the last frame.Know what you're getting into, a passionatly made film about what drives one to both excel and what drives one to madness, and the dangers of excess beyond reason.  If you have read the book, regardless of whether you liked it or not,see this movie.  You will love what they have retained, and will embrace what they've changed.  this is not a film(not a movie, a film) for everyone.

141,blackwalnut,An Embarrassment,1,1 March 2001,"When Cinemafantastique interviewed Kenneth Branagh on his recently-released version of Frankenstein, the writer asked Branagh to describe his viewpoint, his thematic slant on the story. Quite a natural question for a film maker to be asked, as the notions of theme and point of view are not optional, they are mandatory. A director must decide beforehand on the ideas he wishes to set forth, and craft the means to set them forth clearly. When dealing with a classic, oft-filmed work, he must choose a new slant, and exploit themes that have not been emphasized before (at least, in quite that way), if his work is to be at all original.Branagh's breezy response was something on the order of, ""I didn't really have a theme in mind, I just wanted to tell a good story.""This is precisely why Branagh's version fails: is an unanchored, misguided mess. Herewith is a barely coherent hash of styles, a series of boneheaded choices (a snotty Helena B. Carter as the ""liberated"" Elizabeth Frankenstein), a tangle of hanging threads -- beautiful clothes with no one in them; beautiful sets that form a backdrop to utter nonsense.And it is dreadfully miscast. Branagh's ego trip as Dr. Frankenstein aside, the worst performance of all is that of Robert DiNiro as his creature. In this role, DiNiro proves that Pauline Kael was right all along. For years, Ms. Kael kept telling us that this mediocre talent was considered a great actor just because everyone said he was. In other words, he had been in the right place at the right time, and had stumbled into his undeserved reputation by pure chance. (Check out the way he sleeps through his role in Casino.) The spectacle of Frankenstein's creature mumbling in that repellent, thick New Yorkese is really one of the sorriest moments in all of filmdom -- there is simply no excuse for such a thing. Did anyone bother to tell him the story is set in Switzerland? I saw this movie in New York, at an East Side theater, and the audience was giggling nervously every time DiNiro opened his mouth. Why nervously? Because they ""know"" DiNiro is a ""great"" actor... Because they were embarrassed, pure and simple.And they should have been. Branagh's desire to ""tell a good story,"" while arrogantly disregarding the most basic elements of storytelling, quite naturally produced the opposite effect. In short, it produced an embarrassment.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Two time Academy Award winner Robert DeNiro co-stars as The Creature, Helena Bonham-Carter co-stars as Elizabeth, and Tom Hulce co-stars as Henry Clerval, Victor's friend (a part that is usually combined with another character). Patrick Doyle (Branagh's collaborator) provides the music, and as always, his contribution is a huge part of the film. Academy Award winner Francis Ford Coppola produces the motion picture.Contains mild spoilers.Yes, this version also takes certain liberties with the source material, but like Bram Stoker's Dracula, these serve to expand the source material and do not hurt the movie in any way. However, I am curious about one thing: Why were scenes in the trailer and television spots cut from the film? It is always annoying when that occurs, but the least that can be done is to put those scenes on the DVD, and explain why they were eliminated from the final cut of the picture.As always in Kenneth Branagh's films, this one is well acted, well written and well directed.Rated R for horrific images.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

It is a cinematic adaptation which only loosely follows the bone-dry skeleton of the Romantic novelthat is, its only claim to being ""Mary Shelley's"" Frankenstein is the inclusion of various details which other treatments ignored entirely. This however, does not mean that it does the neglected material any justice.The most unfair damage which this treatment does to the original is to remove all the romance and replace it with a lot of Hollywood bluster. For any of you who have read the novel, the way in which various characters in this movie grab each other by the cuffs and go about rudely thrusting one another against hard surfaces will seem quite alien. Gone are the lonely, wistful men of Shelley's novel. In their place are savage, violent, and intemperate movie machos.The second most criminal offense which this film does to the novel on which it was based is to digress into lengthy, fictitious elaborations upon the story. Frankenstein's education bares no resemblance to his own account in the novel it is a movie in and of itself a regular ""young Frankenstein."" What this movie lacks in intellectual and creative honesty it attempts to make up for with ""period authenticity,"" occasionally dwelling upon the studio's research into the day's scientific foibles rather than furthering the plot. Every time the ""cholera epidemic"" or ""quarantine"" is mentioned, you'll know that the film is striving desperately at a historical correlation with more vigor than it attempts to translate Shelley's novel. The actors and actresses want you to believe that they have assumed a character from a different time but really they sound completely and utterly like themselves. Branagh should be ashamed of himself for his work here there isn't a romantic bone in his performance throughout. Such work belongs on the stage floor of a shoddy, incestuous English playhouse where actors rapidly spout their lines like barking dogs who never once heard of meter, or the use of a ""light touch."" Branagh, and his studio, who have brought us many filmic (though schlock) productions of Shakespeare, have woefully underestimated the average horror fan. This film is suitable only as light entertainment, and will enthuse only children who hated the novel. As much a crime to written literature as Peter Jackson's Lord of The Rings films an ""extreme makeover"" envisioned by corrupt marketing executives in attempt to keep the public consciousness stunted and easily manipulated. De Niro has been transformed, but little else is remarkable about this entire work.((50%. An expensive and overwrought production which betrays its original in about every sense possible.

149,jpanettiere,Not Worthwhile,2,25 January 2005,"The cover of the VHS edition features a film critic's remark that the movie is ""Erotic"", which gives you an idea of how far from the book this movie has fallen. In Branagh's defense, there are a lot of difficulties translating the original work into movie form as there are many long passages of time in which critical details are summarized, also there is a lot of introspection and conversation that would need to be translated into something more visually compelling. There were key details that Branagh changed, though, without good cause. For one thing, the monster was supposed to be 8 feet tall and somewhat demonic in appearance. Branagh opted for a disfigured Robert DeNiro, presumably to save on special effects (or to avoid hiring a basketball player to play the part). In the book, the monster was quite articulate and we have a better understanding of his wretchedness and his wickedness. Numerous comparisons are made between the monster and Adam from The Bible, also the monster and Satan, the powerful fallen angel. Mary Shelley succeeded in simultaneously creating sympathy and revulsion for the brute, but Branagh completely failed to pull this off. He also ruined the romantic relationship between Victor and Elizabeth, which in the book started as deep admiration and built with some suspense and tension until it finally culminated in their marriage and her demise, but Branagh decided to have them fondling each other more or less within the first ten minutes of the film. The viewer is also forced to watch very exaggerated acting from most of the main characters (DeNiro manages to avoid this) as if they're trying to make up for the poor screenplay adaptation by overacting. In short, the only sense in which this was truly faithful to the original work was in that Branagh took bits and pieces of the original, breathed life into it, and created an abomination.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

The creature was not green, did not have bolts jutting out from his neck, and of course, did not have the elevator shoes. The creature was basically normal looking-- if you look past the scars and jagged skin-- and stayed almost perfectly to Mary Shelley's vision. The monster was not created in a castle in Transylvania, and there was no hunchback assistant.However, a different writer should of been hired for the job. The dialogue is unrealistic, and cheesy. Kenneth Branagh should of stayed behind the scenes in the director's chair and not have gotten up in front of the camera, since his acting was exaggerated and too emotional for the part. Yes, the Victor Frankenstein in the book was a crybaby in his own right and was quite emotional, but if you could take that and multiply it by ten, you get Kenneth Branagh's rendition.However, the rest of the cast--Robert De Niro as the wretch, Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth, and John Cleese whose acting was surprisingly good, felt the ""actual"" emotion of the story, and brought it out onto the screen. The scenery is beautiful and the cinematography is just perfect for the story.All in all, the movie's basically perfect. Just remove Kenneth Branagh from the equation and it'll be more than perfect.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

And finally i observed it from the beginning to the end. For sure, i had no the same fear, intense and suspense atmosphere like the first time, but it helped me to understand the characters deeper.It is a story about a man, whose is very talented from his childhood, and his parents have a great expectations regarding him, but suddenly his mother passes away, during giving a birth to his brother and from that moment he decides to make people live forever and to find the way to implement the resurrection of the corps. Finally his dream came true, but from that moment he had to pay for what he had done. The atmosphere of the movie is dark, but extremely attractive. You can't take a look out of it. Soundtracks, the fast change of the shots, uptight ambiance are drawing you into. I felt a deep compassion to the Monster. Robert De Niro's performance is outstanding. In fact, Victor killed all his beloveds, by the hand of the Monster. He created him, but didn't put a soul in. Everyone who is next to him, had to pay for his mistake.""Frankenstein"" is an amazing movie and it is almost criminal how it was underrated.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
157,razvanu,Hollywood's Frankenstein - some SPOILERS,1,17 December 2005,"I have absolutely no clue why it was allowed for this movie to be called ""Mary Shelley's"" Frankenstein. If you go read the book, you will realize how incredibly inferior this movie is to the actual text. Robert DeNiro you say? Don't be fooled! His character barely speaks. In the novel, the creature is very eloquent when he speaks to Victor. In the movie, he can barely move his lips. Also, the character of Victor in the movie shows nothing of the internal struggle that goes on in the novel. He is made into a half-Hollywood hero: when the creature comes to life, he goes chasing after it with an axe LOL And that is just a small example of how this movie does no justice to the novel. If you have read the book, and you are expecting to see it recreated for the screen, you are badly mistaken! If on the other hand you wanna see a typical Hollywood movie, go for it!",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
158,Tiny-11,A very brave effort; a very bad result.,1,5 January 1999,"Francis Ford Coppola and Kenneth Branagh make a very brave effort in retelling Mary Shelly's story, especially in a time when all anyone recalls is that the monster's name is Frankenstein, and that he had a flat head. It's too bad the effort fell as flat. The film starts with promise, then takes a nasty and predictable turn when Dr. Waldeman is murdered. What follows is just another uninspired gory romp, trying to disguise itself as a true retelling of Frankenstein. This movie bares no more resemblance to the original novel than any other incarnation. Kenneth Branagh needs a kick in the teeth, Coppola needs to return to his glory days as a brilliant film maker, and De Niro needs to ask himself why he keeps taking on such awful roles. If these guys were to make a film of the life of Christ, they would have Him climb down from the cross and kick some Roman butt, and still claim accuracy.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
159,AlfredYale,"Great Attempt, Still Flawed",3,14 October 2005,"My critique is simple: Branagh should have shelved his ego and cast a younger man in the role of young Frankenstein. Had he done so, the college-bound lad would have been more believable -- the scene where the pre-college Victor speaks with his ageless pregnant mother is laughable, as he looks slightly older than she does. Also, many of the bloopers/inconsistencies would have been avoided, as the extra time would have afforded him the opportunity to concentrate heavily on his editing and directing (i.e. DeNiro's only flaw was his North American accent, Hulce's accent fades in and out of scenes, Mom never ages a day in, what almost two decades?! etc.) Overall, for a man that seems to have taken on more than he should have, it is a very good movie ...but it had the potential to be a masterpiece.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

So I was really excited to watch the movie that is supposed to be 'true to the original novel'.  Let me tell you that I was QUITE disappointed.  This film is nothing like the original novel.  Kenneth Branaugh should be ashamed.  This is probably his second worst film (after the musical version of Loves, Labours, Lost).  He completely changed the ending, and it was terrible.  If you're ever planning on watching the movie so that you don't have to for a class, DON'T!

When I finally got through the picture, I was overwhelmed. All in all, it's an unspeakably sad film, direction/screenplay/cinematography/acting all top notch. DeNiro is simply brilliant as the absolutely pathetic creature. Helena Bonham-Carter is stunning as always. Her character is very believable and ends up in an outright jaw-dropping-shocking situation. Highly recommend; however, be prepared for an emotional wringing. You'll be more apt to cry rather than scream with this film.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
164,withnailian,Branagh Creates 2 Monsters with this Abomination,1,26 September 2012,"""Sister, Friend, Lover""I believe that this quote, said early on in the film, shows just how abysmal this film really is. To start this review I must first say I have recently read the third edition of Frankenstein for my English Literature course and can honestly say it was one of the greatest books I have ever read. I was well accustomed with what I believed the story to be from how it is often portrayed in various media, but was completely mesmerised by the story, having so many underlying messages and themes, a story that takes us all across the world which gives this novel the worthy status as the pinnacle of the Romantic and Gothic Genre. In the 1930's we got Boris Karloff's iconic portrayal of the monster, a landmark of film, but it certainly did not translate Shelleys wonderful book well to the screen. In fact for nearly 70 years there has never been a Frankenstein adaptation that has ever been faithful to the original book. And so some goon in Hollywood decided Kenneth Branagh would be the go-to guy for the book adaptation. It is actually surprising how someone with such ""talent"" (said with a sore heart)could mess up this badly is truly more shocking and horrifying than any event in this film.It starts off like the book; Walton's ship is trapped in the arctic, where him and the crew see the monster far off and meet the eponymous Frankenstein (Branagh). The characterisation of Walton was just plain awful, not being the romantic adventurer desperate for human companionship from the novel. This character in the book was interesting as it is he whose letters frame the whole novel, it is him who learns Frankenstein's lesson at the end, and it his personality that mirrors Frankenstein's and The Monsters ideologies; Frankenstein's quest for knowledge and exploration and The Monsters need for a companion. But in this adaptation he is barely there, and when he is he is poorly played, acted more like a pompous and arrogant captain than a man striving to explore. And where is the relationship between Frankenstein and Walton? No, Branagh believes that it be better that the captain is aggressive to him, so he can just fall straight into his convulsing story. We are then introduced to the love story between Victor and Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). I do really like Helena Bonham Carter in other films (Particularly in Sweeney Todd) but here it is like watching a completely different actress, as she theatrically throws herself with no meaning or skill from scene to scene. As the pivot to the events in the book, we have Frankenstein's mother die, but in a completely different way to in the book, so we get a gory shot of a dodgy birth. They have also from this film adaptation got rid of Victors younger brother Ernest, changed it so it is Victors professor who has the idea of bringing dead matter back to life, Making Victor meet Henry at university... Eventually all this artistic licensing and changing of the mythology has made this film completely different from the original novel and alienating any true fan of the book. For example, the death of Judith isn't as severe as in the book it is the law that kills her, whilst here it is a lynch mob. It is as if Branagh ran out of running time in the second half so tried to quickly summarise the rest of the book. But in doing this, has stopped it being even remotely Gothic. Where is the vast scenery, where is the slow picking off of the various characters... It is a rushed and bloated mess.The one possible saving grace for this film is Robert De Niro, who does actually create a believable and quite emotional monster. But he is so rushed and thoughtlessly thrown through the action that the audience finds it hard to connect with this innocent gone bad. The rest of the acting in this film is wooden and unbelievable, so the characters that are so well rounded in the book are taken back a step. The penultimate change to Elizabeth's death, making her resurrected in one last experiment by Frankenstein, is just ridiculous and at that point was the last straw to this abhorred film. The ending attempts to be bittersweet, but fails to see the ambiguity that Shelleys novel was regaled with. I did not care when any of the characters, even Victor, died, and I doubt anyone else could.Branagh, a lot like Victor himself, has taken bits of beauty from the book, built and constructed it into this monster and as soon as Branaghs monster has opened its eyes we are revealed to how hideous and monstrous it truly is. You want classic Gothic, read the book, and stay away from this film.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
165,Hyokano,Hardly Mary Shelley's and weakly detailed,6,21 March 2006,"Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of the original ""Frankenstein"" novel was undoubtedly a new approach compared to all others. The idea of moralities within reanimation and the prevention of death especially added to the depth and logic of the film. Unfortunately, the process of production had weakly supported this element and the plot itself was left loosely without proper composition.Although the outline of the film was emotionally powerful, the cuts were amateur and the development of the story was unconvincing. Much of the acting, dialog, and sudden situations were too distracting towards the plot. For instance, it is obvious that it was intended for Victor Frankenstein's obsession towards reanimation and sustaining life was a result of his mother's death, but there was lack of evidence in any scene to actually support this thesis in a realistic manner. The same can be said for the creature, whose motivation and anger against society was extremely demonstrated in his violent actions without a tangible cause for his behavior.Achieving compassion from the audience towards the characters is one of the most essential factors in storytelling. I can see Branagh's attempts for drawing sympathy for both Frankenstein and his creature, but their personalities as a result of a traumatic experience is greatly doubtful considering their ambiguous backgrounds, which was very frustrating to watch at my part. Under these circumstances, the whole concept of the film remains unbelievable and difficult to accept as a highly sophisticated story that it really is.A distinctive method in storytelling is clearly needed to support a more convincing plot for this film. Adjusting the story by cutting out irrelevant scenes and expanding the story by adding specific details in the chain of events can be considered as a quick solution to this problem as well.Despite my criticism towards the main characters, I did however find that Elizabeth's character was in fact convincing and logical. The scenes that involved her and Victor were highly emotional and dramatic. Perhaps these scenes were even the highest points of the film. They can be interpreted as highlights; the fact that each time Victor and Elizabeth meet the true state of the current situation seems to emerge, helping the viewers better understand the characters. Judging from this viewpoint, Elizabeth's character was the most crucial to this films coherence.From my perspective, the development of the plot was awfully rushed to make a simple and yet profound point against the many issues brought up in this film. The heavy use of monologue is one of my proofs for this conclusion. I have many regrets, however I do believe there is a lesson in this story worth learning about. I strongly recommend this film in this sense, but not as a source of critical entertainment. I would suggest for all viewers to lower any expectations prior to watching this film.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
166,phantomlon,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: An amazing film.,10,20 January 2005,"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein holds a unique place in film history as one of the most thought-provoking films ever made. Kenneth Branagh's Victor Frankenstein is simply the most obsessed mad scientist ever seen on film, and pays the ultimate price for his actions. Robert DeNiro's creature is a marvel to behold, inspiring pity and causing terror in equal measure. The horror of creating such a being, without soul or identity, has never been told so brutally.The themes of the novel are never forgotten in the film's attempt to horrify. You feel the tension mounting as the ""birth"" of the creature draws nearer. The creation scene is spectacular, rivaled only by the 1931 version. While Boris Karloff will always remain the quintessential Frankenstein monster, DeNiro comes in a close second. His final scene, waiting for the flames of his father's funeral pyre to consume him and end his miserable existence, bring tears to my eyes every time I watch it. Bravo!",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

168,duncanja,Worth seeing for De Niro's monster,6,1 November 2021,"This movie is proof that greater faithfulness (though still partial) to your source material is no guarantee of a successful film. In the 1930s, James Whale and his colleagues made two great ones taking what they pleased from Mary Shelley and inventing the rest. This version succeeds only with the monster itself, and its striking to see that the otherwise frantic pace of this film slows down and becomes most coherent when the monster takes center stage. Much credit goes to Robert De Niro for a nuanced and empathetic performance that almost, but not quite, redeems this adaptation. The sequence in which he secretly helps an impoverished farm family and befriends their blind grandfather is most effective and comes straight from Mary Shelley's remarkable work (it's also the clear inspiration for the blind hermit sequence in Whale's Bride of Frankenstein, hilariously sent up in Young Frankenstein).The rest of the movie is often incoherent and overwrought. Despite some impressive moments, it never matches the stately motion or design of the old Universal horror creations. But De Niro is great because, like Boris Karloff before him, he uses his actor's intuition to find the heart of the monster, and he never overplays the part. He makes this fkawed adaptation worth seeing.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

The acting is superlative (esp. from Brannagh and De Niro) and the special effects, although not amazing, are good enough. Brannagh skillfully conveys many emotions in this film - horror, sadness, amazement, pity and even a bit of humour (provided by Tom Hulce). The film comes very close to being better than even Mary Shelley's novel and I would recommend it to anyone except those with a nervous disposition as some scenes are profoundly disturbing (especially for younger viewers).

I first saw this on televisiion when i was twelve and thought it was cool how they made it new and more serious. I have however just finished reading the book which is excellent and now we are watching it again in class. After the first 30 minutes of the film, my friend whispers to me that this movie has terrible acting. Later I correct him. The acting isn't bad, there simply is no character development. For example, in the beginning of the film when Victor's mother dies, we as the audience are suppose to feel something but we don't. She had what, a total of 2 minutes of screen time. I think brannagh just rushed through things just to get to the creature which is expertly played by De Niro. Brannagh must have been worried about the wide release and how he'd have to keep the audience interested. Therefore he missed out some good things and made the movie worse. The parts with the creature are done extremely well and the overall theme and feeling of the movie are perfect. I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 just because of de niro.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

179,andrewroom,"My goodness, Branagh, how did you get through the door with a head that size?",5,29 November 2007,"The film was good. But.....Good points first: It was almost completely faithful to the book until halfway through. Great acting from all involved. Music, costumes and scenery were all great.Bad points: It strays from the book so much the further into the film you get. Most of the time, it's to make the story more dramatic and 'Hollywood'. For example: Justine is trialled in the book but hanged instantly in the film. Also, Victor meets the creature on a glacier whilst on holiday with his family in the book, whereas in the film the monster purposely comes to find him. Victor does not end up creating the second monster in the book, but in the film there is an awful sequence in which he reanimates Elizabeth, who was violently murdered. She then sets herself on her fire and runs through the house, setting it on fire and jumps from a large height. Many other changes were made, however some were simply to cut time (as movies do).One major thing is that in the book, Frankenstein is a flawed man (a quality of a Greek Tragedy). This leads to his downfall, and nobody can deny it. However, in the film Ken Branagh obviously could not stand to play a bad character (think of what it would do to his image!), so any flaw of Victor mentioned is transferred to the creature, portraying him as the morally evil one. This completely rules out one of the key points in the book - the nature/nurture argument. If you raise your children properly, they will turn out fine. If you leave them to nature, anything could happen. Victor did not care for the creature, so eventually, after A SERIES OF TERRIBLE EVENTS (not caused by the creature), he has no choice but to turn bad. However, the film shows him as the bad guy (ok, when the monster is with the cottagers he's trying to be kind, but when he tells his tale to Victor, he is portrayed as completely evil - in the book, he's trying to make amends). So there we go. If you have no intention of reading the book then watch this film. If you like extravagant scenes with explosions and violent deaths, watch this. However, if you love the wonderfully intelligent novel by Mary Shelley, you may want to give this one a miss (at least after watching half of it).

While there were a few obligatory corny bits (""I will have my revenge...Frankenstein!"") it was still spectacular. Robert De Niro conveyed the part of a tortured soul so well. When you watch the movie, you know that this man was once a well-respected scientist who was one of the most intelligent at the university, and he has been reduced to a wandering madman with no memories who is not even shown basic common courtesies. When he is so utterly consumed by his quest for revenge, he kills Elizabeth, then tries to take her as his own and she still ends up dead, a single act resulting in the death of both Frankenstein and his creation.

184,aidanhill,A Very Bad Film by a Very Bad Actor/Director,1,17 October 2005,"I rarely write online reviews, but after reading most of the comments here my fingers couldn't type fast enough. Clearly, the majority of reviewers here saw a different film than the one I did. A masterpiece? Artful? Brilliant? Either that, or they just have poor taste in films. I still have no interest in really reviewing this film, but let me clear up a few erroneous statements from previous reviews: 1) Please don't trash James Whale's 1931 film unless you've actually SEEN it  all of it, because it's a far superior film to this, bolts and all. Whale may have changed the story quite a bit, but he captured the spirit of the novel and created one of the greatest cinematic icons of all time. (And Boris Karloff played the monster, not Lon Chaney).2) Although this film is truer to the original novel, it is not faithful and makes considerable changes that alter the overall intent of the story. There is no love triangle in the book, Victor Frankenstein is a medical student of about 18-19 years of age (Branagh is well past the sell-by date for that), and he creates the monster entirely by accident. (No drama whatsoever in the book - he wakes up with the creature hovering near his bed. No electricity, no solar panels as in ""The True Story"", no amniotic fluid as in this film).3) De Niro is laughable as the creature. He's completely out of his element and hopelessly miscast. As for make-up, Karloff is closer to original story (minus the bolts). In the novel the creature has weepy yellow eyes, skin like a cadaver, and is nine feet tall. Karloff's make-up was green because when filmed under proper lighting (on B&W film) green make-up looks deadly pale, almost pure white, not because the monster in that film was supposed to be green. Again, it's B&W folks! This story will always present challenges for a filmmaker because it's not really horrific as a story by our standards, or by the standards of the 1930s for that matter, hence the bolts. It's was a novel of the Romantic Era, and the very premise was frightening in and of itself.The real core of the novel is the on-going philosophical debate between young Victor, and his bastard child - the creature. Yes, it's a novel about creating life and playing God, but underneath that is a novel about both adolescent sexuality  Young Victor, alone in his attic, fooling around with nature  and also the consequences of creating a life and then not taking responsibility for it. Branagh's film is too caught up in hammy acting and nauseating camera moves to ever really get there. Yes, the debates are there, but the soul isn't. It's a vaudeville sideshow masquerading as art. For those with only a passing knowledge of the book, it may seem truer, but Whale's 1931 film is actually much closer to the novel's heart in its depiction of ""the other"", the outcast, the bastard than this ever comes close to.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
185,bethanjmorgan,o.k,6,5 October 2005,It was good. Some bits were scary at parts but good. The reason I gave it a 6 was because it was a bit hard to follow at times. The sounds gave it more atmosphere and the actors made you feel more tense so if your into scary atmosphere sort of films then watch it. It's good. Robert De Niro was great for making you feel as your in the middle of the action. But there's parts that really confuse you. (most are the scenes that the Frankenstein monster is in) Some scenes are unbearable. The only reason I watched it was for my G.C.S.E and I thought that it was going to be bad but the climax of the story pulled me in so much I was sad when it finished.,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
186,user-177-817364,Is a movie about science attracting tragedy,8,9 December 2014,"This movie is quite interesting, a very worth watching movie. In this movie, most attract an audience is the environment. That environment has shown actor expresses mood. It has been nice and sad and hates environment, captures the audiences' attention to the movie. Frankenstein is a novel written by Mary Shelley. In 1994, it is taken from Kenneth Branagh's adaptations of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to create this movie. The genres of this movie are drama, romance, science fiction and horror. A man praises life and creates a monster; however the monster destroys and makes a tragedy.The story begins in the Arctic; an exploration ship saves a man. The man tells the captain about his story. The story is happening on Geneva and his name is Victor Frankenstein who is a doctor. One day Victor's mother born his brother William, but his mother dies. Victor is sad and he hopes can see his mother again. One day he meets a guy and, he tells Victor he has success to let a dead man alive. Victor starts to get interest and he steals that guy notebook. Victor begins to research and one day he uses technology to let a dead man alive. He succeeded to revive the monster and named him Frankenstein. However, the monster is quite ugly. He is afraid and ran away. When the citizens saw him, they were fearful and discriminated against him, children. However, the monster has emotions; he is kind and hopes to be able to make friends and family. Frankenstein runs to the village and hides in a pigsty. People discovered about Frankenstein and drove away him; this shows that Frankenstein hates his creator. Frankenstein kills William (Victor's brother) and Elizabeth (Victor's wife). This lets Victor to hate Frankenstein and he starts to chase him. There are three main characters in this movie, namely Victor Frankenstein who is performed by Kenneth Branagh, Victor's wife Elizabeth who is performed by Helena Bonham Carter, and the monster Frankenstein who is performance by Robert De Niro. The most attentive part in this movie is the actress Helena Bonham Carter. Her acting skills are good. She portrays Elizabeth who is the principal character's wife. When I have seen the film, I personally thought that her acting was outstanding. Elizabeth dies by the monster took her heart, her expression surreal. Of course this is nausea, but she is very good to portray the role of a good wife who will care for her fiancé, miss him, love him, and support to him, also in one part she want to give up her fiancé which shows her powerful love towards him, but finally she went back to her fiancé, she can't leave her fiancé, this s him. However, at last, Elizabeth burns herself. In that time, she has to show one person's emotion for hatred, sadness and despair. Helena Bonham Carter's action and her expression are the level of expertise. In this movie, the part I like is when Frankenstein discovers Victor Frankenstein dies and gets emotional. He tells those expeditions ""He is my father"". On this part, it means Frankenstein although has an unattractive appearance he still has a kind and warm heart. Although Frankenstein hates Victor creating him but he loves him unconditionally. For Frankenstein, Victor is his father. This is showing the people of good morals. The part that I didn't like is when those citizens drove away and hurt Frankenstein, they did that is because they were afraid of Frankenstein. They didn't try to understand and help him. Frankenstein didn't do anything, but those citizens just hate him only because of his appearance.This movie can learn lots of new things. Like technology and emotion and mans, nature at birth is good. The technology can make many things that can beyond people's imagination. It can also create many consequences that would be unimaginable. People only make, but they never think about the results. The emotion can control people to do next, people always change their emotion, and hate and anger are the most dreadful things because this can lead people to kill others for revenge. The man's nature at birth is good which mean when people are born into this world, they are good and innocent; however the society destroys their nature and lets them become hateful and selfish and discriminate against others.I recommend this movie to adults, because it can teach people a few life lessons and morals, allows them to know when a man is born into this world they are innocent. Science and technology can destroy people. This movie was awarded 67th Oscar Golden Statuettes and best make-up award. For this movie, I would not recommend it for children and old people as there a few scary parts and it is not good to old people heart. Also this is incomprehensible for children as they cannot understand the story. The MPAA for this movie is R. For my opinion I think this movie is a well written story with a good outline and plot. Those actors and actresses have captured the scenes and developed the plot. They show their emotion well and used special lighting effect to enhance the environment and the viewer's attention.For my personal opinion of the rating system, I am going to give it an A, four stars and 5. The reason is I think this really is a good movie, it has shown human virtues and vice although it is a little scary and might not suit all viewers.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
187,clem-cost,It was... interesting,5,23 October 2017,"I saw this movie recently and as I've also read the book I'm rather clueless about all the changes they've lade with the original story... But it's an adaptation, changes have to be made, I just don't get the point of THOSE changes... Overall I enjoyed it, I had some good laugh (either the scene was genuinely funny or too ridiculous to handle). My main problem is I find the casting well chosen but they all overact so much ! And for Henry, I'm not an English speaker but I thought his accent was switching from English to American throughout the whole movie and apparently, reading some reviews, I was right (I'm proud of myself on that point ^^). De Niro's creature was nice though, I like how the design is much more realistic and his performance was nice.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
188,personman_4,Simply the worst film I have ever seen,1,24 October 2007,"There is simply no excuse for this film. If it is meant to be a stylised ""melodramatic"" version of the novel, then by any standards of artistic taste it should be melodramatic, not a disastrously badly written hotch-potch of cinematic ideas. The ""melodrama"" merely makes the viewer run to vomit in the kitchen sink. The cast is fantastic, stellar; but they are made to spew such insipid, laughable lines that I would not be surprised if not a single one of them doesn't regret being in it - excepting Kenneth Branagh, who is probably still in denial about blotting his brilliant career with this utter tripe. The 1931 version deviates seriously from the book, but is a quality film. This version sticks closer to Mary Shelley's story but is somehow much more of a deviation - a deviation away from a sense of style and wit, and the changes the writers have made (Justine/Victor/Elizabeth love triangle?!) are simply disastrous. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie - I laughed pretty much all the way through. If you want to watch a BAD BAD film, this is the one for you. It is the best, worst film I have ever seen.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
189,Cricket-7,The Worst Movie - EVER,1,16 May 1999,"I think that perhaps this movie might view better on video than it did in the cinema.  When I saw it there, it was like watching an auto wreck.  You didn't want to watch it, but there was something strange that made you stay and look at this disaster of a film.  As one person before said, you stayed just to see what horrible idea they'd come up with next.The movie was so filled with such bad over-acting, that it insulted the intelligence of the viewer.  The staircase was an example of the over-the-top design and story devices they used, but that were miserable failures.If you have a choice, never watch this movie.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

192,crisantony1666,Not Mary Shelly's Frankenstein,1,2 November 2006,"I fail to see how this film can go around with the title: ""Mary Shelly's Frankenstein"". Almost every single scene in the movie is different then how events took place in the book. It may be better then the old Frankenstein movies, but this one isn't true enough to the book to be called Mary Shelly's. Victor's mother did not die giving birth in the book, she died of scarlet fever. In the book Victor did not have any professors helping with his research into galvanization. In the book, he was friends with Clerval since childhood and Clerval was also studying oriental language at the college after the creature was given life, he never studied medicine. Elizabeth is basically only the same in name. The creature speaks eloquently in the book, not so much in the movie. I can understand that some things had to be changed to fit into the time limit for a movie, but some changes were completely unnecessary, like this one: in the book, Victor and Elizabeth call each other cousins, and Elizabeth calls Victor's father uncle. They didn't call each other brother and sister. Why make this change? This movie might be good as a movie by itself, but if you are looking for something accurate to the book, I implore you to read the book because there doesn't seem to be a movie that fits that description.In my opinion, this is not Mary Shelly's Frankenstein; this is Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
193,minthiadryhard,great human drama,10,30 October 2006,"Frankenstein is a deep human story. I like this movie so much. There are many people who imagine a monster when they hear the name, ""Frankenstein"". It's easy to misunderstand but it's not a monster's name. ""Frankenstein"" is the name of the doctor who creates the monster. This story,""Frabkenstein"", is set in the 18th century. Captain Walton(Aidan Quinn) of a sailing boat toward the North Pole help the man who step on a sled in a storm. His name is Victer Frabkenstein(Kenneth Branagh). The man begins to tell his strange fate. The man connect the dead bodies and give electronic shocks, then the body has begin to move. He notices the importance of a thing as soon as an experiment succeeds and he leave the created man. After that the creature goes to get revenge..... The lament of the man who create who a monster and the monster who were created. It's not just a horror movie. There is a problem about technology to approach a domain of God, what's human being or what's life. A realistic performance by Robert DeNiro(the monster), a beautiful heroine, Helena Bonham Carter, indeed there are many highlights. It's a really sad, profound, thoughtful human drama. Whenever I watch this movie I always feel excited and touched movie so that is the reason why this is my favorite movie.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
194,givetofitz,Frankenstein: Movie or Mess-up?,4,2 November 2006,"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein... having just read the novel, I came into the movie prepared for a fabulous visualization- a great story mixed together with horror and fascination. However, after viewing this remake of the classic novel,I wish I had just stuck to the text or that old-school black and white version. Yes, I think the director tried to follow the the text as best he could without drawing out the film, but he also took some liberties which, in my opinion take away from the overall movie. The construction of Victor Frankenstein's lab was fabulous- that Gothic, rusty, bones-and-beakers room was just like I would have envisioned it. And the monster! That too was a great rendition of Shelley's monster- maybe just a bit too small- although, the only man big enough to really fit the feature type of the original huge monster would be Shaq- and we all found out how good of an actor he was in Kazaam... But getting to the point, the director overdid the rest of the scene where the monster bursts out of his container. I'm not sure where all that goo came from exactly, but the slipping and sliding was way to much for me. I mean, what was the point of that anyway? Don't forget the ending either! OK, so the pyrotechnics were nice when monster-Elizabeth set fire to herself, but where exactly did those explosions come from? It looked like some sort of bomb went off- didn't know a lamp could do that. Or my favorite part- after they find William dead- and the father comes out with the holler we all know so well- ""nnnnnnnoooooooooooo!"" Come on now, ease of the drama a little bit at least. Well, those are the overly excessive scenes,and if they were deleted, I think the movie would be many times better. Just take out a few of the unnecessary scenes, or just the excessive parts of them, and there you have it- a great movie. All the parts of a good horror/Gothic/gripping story are there, just the severely overly dramatic parts give an overlying tone of ridiculousness. Sorry for such a smash-review, but seriously- what was up with the half-naked wrestling???",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

But, if you're absolutely terrified of blood and gore (like me), you'd enjoy the film more. I had to watch this film in my English lesson (because we were studying the book) and I nearly fainted. Some of the boys in the class thought it was stupid and not scary at all, but most of the girls were terrified, including me. I know this sounds stupid, but if you're scared of the movie, you'll actually enjoy it. The boys, who thought the film was just idiotic, didn't bother watching it, so they didn't manage to enjoy it. But after I watched it, I thought ''Except for the scenes that made me feel like hiding under my table, that movie was actually pretty good!''

Mary Shelley wrote a masterpiece that has survived for centuries, but this movie will not earn the title of Classic. The movie contains blatant novel inaccuracies. To title a movie Mary Shelley's Frankenstein implies respect will be played to the original written work. Victor's mother did not die in childbirth, Victor had more than one sibling, there were no sex scenes in the work, Henry did not attend university with Victor, Elizabeth did not visit Victor while he was at school, there was no cholera scare, and there were no electric eels in the novel.

The film is historically accurate and adds important information regarding medical education and practices in that time period. Additionally, Branagh has added modern psychology to the characterization, thus making the protagonist's obsession and decisions more universally accessible. The creation scene is genius, truly showing us a ""monstrous birth"".I cannot believe that this film did not receive excellent reviews when it was released. As a teacher of literature, I have shown it to my students for years, and every year the entire class sits in rapt attention. They even thank me for giving them the opportunity to view it.

My students and I read the book and then watch this movie to point out where Hollywood went astray. We laugh out loud at how ridiculously different it really is. We also laugh at the overacting that Branaugh does, but that's another story.I don't really know about the quality or craftsmanship that is in this film, but I know it drives the point home about how important it is to read the book and not rely on Hollywood for the answers to a test or paper.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

Mary Shelley communicates great messages through her book, which unfortunately are lost or twisted in the movie. Of course, I should say that Robert DeNiro's performance as the monster was splendid.

It attempted to be serious when there should have been frivolity and it failed at being taken seriously when it should have done, in fact i would not have been at all surprised if Victor Frankenstein proceeded to burst into song and further accompanied by the monster with light cabaret, in fact, it would have been a welcome relief to guide my attention further away from the awful acting of Kenneth.Though credit to Robert De Niro, as always, played his part brilliantly. if you want to understand the real story of Victor Frankenstein, READ THE BOOK FIRST!",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
201,thetommonster,Utter Disappointment,1,2 November 2002,"1993: Kenneth Branagh presents the world with his vibrant, earthy, and joyous adaptation of Much Ado about Nothing.  YAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY!!!1994: The same Kenneth Branagh presents the world with his lame, boring, dreary, adaptation of Frankenstein.  BLLLLLLEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!Last summer, I finally got around to reading ""Frankenstein."" Within a few days of finishing the book, I found myself on IMDb and -- what should I find? -- a recent film version directed and starring none other than Kenneth Branagh, one of the most talented men of his generation and a personal favorite of mine!  What!?  It co-stars Helena Bonham-Carter, Ian Holm and Rovert de Niro!  Gracious heavens above, it even has John Cleese and Richard Briers! I began to count the hours until the video-store opened.What I saw was nothing short of the complete inverse of my expectations. In fact, this pitiable piece of celluloid was so anguishingly boring, that I turned it off about 2/3 of the way through.  Specifically:1) If one of the surest signs of a poorly adapted screenplay is the loss of narration, then this screenplay -- to put it delicately -- sucks.  The narration is omniscient and chronological, which makes the film powerless and utterly, utterly boring.2)  What!?  Couldnâ?Tt we at least MENTION Paradise Lost???3) What couldn't Branagh find any extras?  Why do all of the scenes in Frankenstein Hall look so EMPTY?  (Note: with the right bunch of people, you can get a good laugh by saying ""Today, I am eleventy-one!"" when Holm gives that little speech from the stairwell).4) Branagh's first priority seems to be filming himself shirtless.  His second is over-acting.  His third is to make-out with Helena.In short, this film was a waste of talent and creative ability; donâ?Tt let it be a waste of your time.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
202,T-Hi_phatt,WHERE Was the Mary Shelley in This?!,1,29 November 2009,"I don't know what movie other people who thought this followed the book were seeing, but it did NOT! The book is fresh in my mind, as I finished reading it a mere 20 hours before watching the so-called movie version, and the only thing this movie had in common w/the book was the fact that there was a creature in it! How to begin? Lesse...(1) Victor knew Henry from CHILDHOOD, not from school, as the movie would have you believe. (2) Victor's mother died from ILLNESS, not childbirth! (3) Elizabeth NEVER followed Victor to school and his Professor did NOT die! (4) Where was the creature's long, flowing, black hair?! (5) Justine's end was NOT via lynch-mob! (5) Too many of the occurrences took place in the wrong places! What happened to the hut in the small town, for instance? (6) Felix's family was all wrong; his fiancée did come from overseas, but the other woman was his sister! (7) Victor did NOT just decide not to make the female creature because the creature chose his mother's body! Victor was actually only moments away from bringing a female creature to life and he tore her body apart! (8) What happened to Henry's death? (9) Don't even get me started on the whole Elizabeth reanimated thing! (10) The ending was wrong! Victor died of bad health and the creature jumped off the ship, off to kill himself! (11) The beginning was wrong, too! The monster passed by the ship first, on a sledge. THEN Victor approached, also on a sledge, NOT on foot! (12-50) Just too much to name! Now, I know that movie's always take artistic license, but this one just took too much; it wasn't even recognizable as the same story as the one I had just read.

203,revajd,This is the REAL Classic!,9,5 October 2010,"Staying very close to Mrs. Shelley's original, a beautifully acted piece with DeNiro, Branaugh, and Carter in some of the BEST work of their careers. One often does not experience this story as simple Horror, but rather as wonderful Drama with a strong horror base. The Creature here is no monster in the usual sense. He is more of a man with a grave deformity who is treated with total disdain and fear by all who see him...even though they know nothing of his heart. This is a story of love, and hope, set against inconceivable cruelty. Like many of the folks here I have always enjoyed the old Boris Karloff stuff, as well as Christopher Lee and several other ""jump behind the seats"" takes on the Frankenstein name. However none of those little charmers rises to the 9/10 I give this truly wonderful piece of work. Absolutely GREAT",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
204,Eggbot-sam,Fails as a 'Horror',4,24 March 2009,"Kenneth Branagh's poor attempt at making a film of Mary Shelley's 19th century novel 'Frankenstein' fails to give across the message that Shelley's world famous creation manages to do. The adaptation mostly follows the line of the book with the enthusiastic Professor Frankenstein who is determined to create life after his mother dies giving birth his younger brother. Despite the fact the film is based on the book it lacks the ability to ""truly curdle the blood"".Isn't the film supposed to be a horror? Although the makeup done by Daniel Parker, Paul Engelen and Carol Hemming was pretty frightening, the film never really gave me that spine-shiver that is expected from a horror. It lacks that sense of darkness and suspense. When expecting an ending that was similar to the book's, it is very surprising to find that Branagh has changed it. The gory scene of the monster ripping Elizabeth's heart out is then followed by a laughable failure of the zombie-like Elizabeth running through the house in flames. Despite the effect's this is unrealistic and whole house is a blaze in less then a minute! There are many great actors in the film such as the multi-talented Kenneth Branagh who both directs and stars in the film, Robert De-Niro who plays the distraught creature, Tom Hulce who plays Henry Clerval (Frankenstein's closest friend) and Helena Bonham Carter who plays Elizabeth, but this still doesn't bring the film to life. Branagh's attempt of the science-obsessed professor Victor Frankenstein is first seen in the cold blizzards of the Arctic wearing a frosted fur coat. He is taken aboard by Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) and begins to narrate his life, first as a youngster and then how he came to make his hideous creation. His Frankenstein is dramatic and over-acted but doesn't bring out the enthusiasm of Victor Frankenstein described in the novel. Hugely contrasted to Branagh's attempt of Frankenstein is Robert De Niro's superb performance of the creature. His performance conveys the feelings that the creature is described to have such as hate for Victor Frankenstein and lots of sadness. The way he portrays the creature really allows the audience to feel sympathy for Frankenstein's creation.The music seems to play throughout the whole film and is as annoying as Kenneth Branagh's loud and over the top acting. Patrick Doyle's music doesn't give the film any suspense, instead it leaves the audience trying to concentrate on the rest of the adaptation. Also it is hard trying to concentrate when the film is constantly switching from scene to scene, and it's jumpy camera is making you dizzy.The book's sophisticated language appears very simplified as many of the words and some of the language from the book is not used, but this allows the audience to understand more of the story. However maybe if Branagh had tried less to change it and had used more of the original dialogue and narrative, the film could be more interesting and therefore hold the interest of the viewing audience longer.In the scene after Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) has brought the creature to life. Frankenstein is lying in his bed, he awakes from a bad dream and the monster appears in a flash of lighting. Everybody knows this cliché from any traditional horror movie! Branagh should have paid more attention to the detail in the book and possibly produced a film much more true to it's title and not the farce that was created.Despite the fact that there are many unimpressive sections of the film there is undoubtedly some parts which will entertain the audience, such as the making of the monster. When Frankenstein is stitching and bringing the monster together there is a sense of realism and anticipation. This bit was enjoyable but unfortunately this short interlude of excitement lasted no more then 5 minutes and soon returned to it's dull but laughable self.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

(example:when his mom died and the tree was struck by lighting, both pivotal parts of the story that happened in about 2 seconds) Also, lines were missing, lines which were vital to explaining what was happening in the movie. The dialogue in this film would make an Ed Wood film look like Citizen Kane,and this film could not even be salvaged with the multitudes of fantastic actors. An example of this films awful writing would be when DR.Frankenstein rejected the monster all he could say was ""NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO"" SIDE NOTE: I may be wrong about what the Sam hell was happening in that scene, but it's not my fault, it's the film's terrible writing.The scenes in this film, you could say, flat out forgot the fundamentals of writing a scene (want, struggle, false conclusion,turning point,then real conclusion)Because of the indulgent film making in this movie this film isn't ""so-bad-its-good"" this film is so-bad-it's-terribleOver all this film is bad and that's being nice",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

I really think the film is wonderful and possibly the best film version of the book. A great cast with some fine British actors (Ian Holm, Richard Briers, John Cleese and of course Kenneth Branaugh). They all play their characters extremely well although John Cleese and Richard Briers are hardly recognisable under the costumes (I had to check the cast lists). The film shows a lot of blood and guts but hey! Frankenstein is meant to chop up bits of people! Messy yes but definately not boring.

209,SunsetGlory,An effort to be respected... and avoided,4,8 May 2006,"This 1994 Kenneth Branagh twist on Mary Shelley's classic Gothic horror novel finds itself coming into existence in the middle of a decade of constant remakes and endless melodramatic horror films. The basic story is ingrained into America's pop culture: a young scientist, Victor Frankenstein, whose obsession with death leads to his obsession with creating life, with playing God. The creation of his monster, a combination of the bodies of executed criminals, (by the way, an entire scene of this movie is devoted to the collection, mutilation, and sewing together of said bodies) goes awry, the creature escapes and, once educated, swears revenge on Victor and his family. Victor marries his adopted sister, Elizabeth, and is driven to madness and subsequent death at his creation's hands. Sadly, it is here that the major similarities between the original novel and Kenneth Branagh's creation end.Mary Shelley's classic Gothic horror novel has been endlessly analyzed and debated over, true to the wish of the late Mary Shelley, who wanted to write a subtle book that made you think, even long after you've finished reading it. Unfortunately, and for obvious reasons, much of the intended subtlety of Mary Shelley's (as well as that of all authors') work was lost in the transition to the stage and the silver screen. The worst of this, thought, is that many of these movies, perhaps for the sake of audiences not familiar with the original text and who did not (do not) like complicated protagonists, try very hard to get the audience on Victor's side. They try to prove that he is, in his heart of hearts, an honorable man who made a mistake, and is now constantly paying for it at the merciless hands of his creation; failing, in the process, to remind the audience that, whatever ""The Monster"" is, Victor made him. As the creature of this adaptation says to Victor on ""the sea of ice"" in the mountains of Geneva, ""You gave me these movements, but you did not tell me how to use them. Now, two people are dead, because of us."" The overall effect of the movie was, thinking back on it, very bloody. The death of Victor's wife on her wedding night was gruesomely changed to suit the tone of the rest of the movie. The blood in the remainder of the movie deviates unnecessarily from the book, (the creature rips out Elizabeth's heart on her wedding night with Victor, and when Victor tries to reanimate her with Justine's body, the creature appears. They battle for her, and she takes her own life, burning the house to the ground) and it looks very, very fake. The visuals, in this way, are reminiscent of Bram Stoker's Dracula, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, producer of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Dracula, which came out in 1992, also involved large and unnecessary explosions of blood. Kenneth Branagh, along with his co-stars, deserves credit for his efforts, but this adaptation of Frankenstein ultimately leaves a bad taste in the mouth that is not the terror provided by a good thriller, but the disgust provided by a bad one. A disgust that is heightened by the fact that the title bears its author's name.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
210,joshradon,Do not watch this movie!,1,28 April 2006,"I've never seen a piece of literature raped like this before. I don't think that the makers of this film ever even read the book. Mary Shelley is rolling over in her grave. Brannagh, what have you done? I'd never seen this movie until tonight, but not only does it fail as an adaptation, it fails as a film. It's absurdly cheesy and completely denies it's source material. I've always loved Brannagh's work, especially with Shakespeare, but this is a total mess. They really should have at least attempted to make it closer thematically with the novel, particularly if they are going to claim that it is Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. For shame.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
211,Badbrother13,One Man's Celebration of Himself,3,20 August 2005,"This film would be considered a piece of cinematic art were it not for the overinflated ego of Kenneth Branagh. You can only imagine how much scenery the British version of Orson Welles (only a lot less fat) chews up, considering he had a heavy hand in the writing, and not only directs the film but cast himself in the title role. To sum up the film, here it is: Kenneth Branagh raving. Helene Bonham Carter with an afro. Kenneth Branagh raving. John Cleese with some bad teeth. Kenneth Branagh raving. Robert DeNiro and Kenneth Branagh rolling in a very homo erotic way in some goo. And that's it.While I show the utmost respect for Branagh's impressive roster, his in-your-face thespian tactics don't translate onto film very well at all. The end result is his portrayal as Dr. Frankenstein as an arrogant, jittery madman with delusions of grandeur. Having read the original novel, the good doctor is much more subdued and determined. Kenneth simply seems to be thrusting himself into every single crevice of this film as if to say ""this is all about ME!"" Robert DeNiro doesn't pull off the monster very well, due to the fact that this movie clearly does not show you a monster, it shows you Robert DeNiro trying to be one. In past film incarnations, considerable effort was made on the part of the creative designers to make the man underneath the makeup seem monstrous. In this film, it was almost as if an effort was made to make sure we never forgot ""Look, it's an important Hollywood actor trying to be menacing."" To me, this film would be more at home as a segment of Masterpiece Theater than an actual film. The only thing scary about this film is the size of Kenneth Branagh's head.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
212,chasccox-1,Don't waste your time,2,30 October 2007,"Robert DeNiro is beyond his talents. He is a one trick pony who can only play a New York street guy, nothing else. See the original with Boris Karloff to see a performance that works. Branaugh admitted that DeNiro was miscast and would not take direction well.The 1931 version has better acting, better dialog, and a better director. The special effects are quite good for its time and still hold up today. Don't miss it if you haven't seen it. The only positive thing this one has is it sticks to the novel, but everything else is worse.Color adds nothing to this film, since much takes place in snow and the monster is dressed in a Trappist Monk's habit. DeNiro is ludicrous!",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
213,robertn-5,Pathetic version of a great plot!,1,22 October 2005,"This film obviously has no understanding of the original plot (which is still current and worthy of discussion today), but the person(s) responsible did see ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and managed to screw up that plot as well when they tried to incorporate it into this film. The Mel Brooks film has more respect for Mary Shelly than this disaster. No wonder a discount chain sold this to me for $5.50. It wasn't worth it, even at that price! The concept of putting together body parts is a contemporary consideration because we are now able to achieve this. The fact that this was written so long ago (by a woman who was challenged by her husband and a friend to see who could write the best horror story) should give it the historic respect it deserves. This film ignores the historic significance and current relevance of Mary Shelly's work.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
214,janszafranski,A brave attempt and very nearly pulls it off,9,12 March 2005,"This was never going to get a constant high grade (which it deserves) because of the legacy of the Karloff version. Brannagh wanted to do a 'true' version from the book but if he had, people brought up on the Karloff version would never have accepted it (...what, a beautiful creature with long flowing black hair, superhuman speed and strength and a beautiful way with language... where was the flat-headed, neck-bolted green-skinned grunting stumbling 8-footer?). Likewise, fans of the book wouldn't accept the film if he used any of the 1930's 'mistakes'. Brannagh was left with this connundrum but I think he managed to pull it off... meeting both camps halfway, so an 'ugly' Creature who becomes almost eloquent whose hair has not yet regrown/was burned. Brannagh really does deserve more credit for this film... he even managed to include episodes of Shelley's experiences in the film (electricity experiments...thunder, frog and hand) for reference to the author (Elizabeth is actually Mary Shelley in character). I would have given it a 10 except that young victor shouldn't have been played by Brannagh because he doesn't convince as a teenager.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
215,jmcguire-3,This movie was absolutely abominable to any educated person.,1,23 March 2005,"I am a high school English teacher who is in the process of teaching ""Frankenstein"" to my classes. When I rented the movie ""Mary Shelley's Frakenstein"", I expected it to be consistent with the novel; hence, the reference to Mary Shelley in the actual title. This movie makes me internally conflicted between anger and laughter. The actual novel was butchered. There are countless scenes that are just absolutely fabricated. The movie has consistent scenes which just don't make sense. If you're going to refer to the author in the title, how about actually honoring the poor woman? Make a movie that respects her story, instead of butchering it. Unfortunately, this woman isn't alive to defend herself and disassociate herself from this film.-Victor's mother died of Scarlet Fever, not during childbirth. -Henry Clerval was a childhood friend; not someone Victor met at Ingolstadt (university). -During the whole novel Victor refuses to tell anybody how he created the creature, while in the novel we have all this detail. -Why the hell was Branaugh putting up a lightening rod in the middle of a field where he and Elizabeth are the tallest objects in the area? How is he able to count down perfectly to when the lightening will strike? Where did that scene come from anyway? -They played up the pseudo incestuous nature of Elizabeth and Victor way too much. -The monster cuts firewood for the cottagers; he doesn't pick fricking radishes for them.This is only the very beginning of the movie and I haven't included nearly all the stupidity.If you read the novel, you should be disappointed in this sorry excuse for a film.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
216,farid-dilmaghani,Brilliantly symbolic,10,28 August 2020,"I am not a fan of horror or any pure generic form, but I appreciate when a creator seeks to distort the rule set and ultimately hijacks it to tell a humanistic story. This is an excellent example of that. Pay good attention to Robert de Niro's scenes and think what it says about reality.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
217,davidann,This film deals effectively with the themes of the book,8,9 January 2006,"I enjoyed this. I watch it a couple of times every year or so when I teach it to students and I am continually impressed with the effective way that Branagh deals with the themes of creation/science/loss etc. The 'birth' scene is especially good for teaching story telling techniques and how light and sound are used to create mood. It is a huge improvement on the Boris Karloff film and much better than anything I remember sitting up late to watch in the 70's! Not entirely sure why this has done so badly with press and public. It's good. Not a masterpiece, but a solid, well made film with some excellent performances.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
218,max_byng,I have never laughed so much at an attempt at a serious film....,1,16 May 2006,"This was just the biggest pile of s**t i have ever seen and i'm serious. Kenneth Brannagh was frankly embarrassing - please God someone stop letting him direct, produce and act in his films because no one can tell him how awful they are. John Cleese's rabbit teeth were hilarious but by far the two most hilarious parts of the film were the look on Brannagh's face when the monster tells him to meet him up on the ice in a few days (he's thinking why not do it now????) and also the scene where Brannagh attempts to save the guy who taught him in the operating room (the camera work is absolutely classic!). All in all i would encourage you to watch this film but only as a comedy - if you do you will laugh for ages! Oh yes and also check out Brannagh's Hamlet - the guy slaughters every film he touches.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
219,andre_prain,One of the best,7,14 June 2005,"It's one of the best Frankenstein movies, that i have seen, other than Young Frankenstein, which is damn funny.But this movie keeps to the whole story, by Mary Shelley. It's well done, and Kenneth Branagh does a great job of being the doctor. I liked it a lot, but in recalling the facts, i was about 11-12 when i watched it, so it might have had a greater affect, but still good.The way the story is told, is great, i am going to have to buy this off amazon, and watch it again, on of my fav. scenes was the ice/snow scene when the characters in the story meet, this ""monster"" as well as the end of the movie.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
220,snoopicusjohnson,awful awful awful SPOILERS,1,8 September 2005,"THis movies is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. Brannagh or whatever his name is a hammy over actor. THis movie had some of the cheesiest overacting I've ever seen. The love between him and carter is flimsy and there chemistry is non existent. I had trouble believing any of the acting it was just a joke. THe movie also lacks consistency and logic.SPOILERS How does a doctor who can bring a creature to life for the first time in human history study it for a matter of minutes before mistakingly thinking it is dead, and then just leaving the body hanging from his ceiling. Later in the movie after he decides he made a mistake in ""playing god"", he refuses to repeat the mistake on someone he had cared for by turning her into the monsters bride. Yet this same moral reasoning does not apply when attempting to reanimate his murdered wife like 2 days later??? If you know it will make her a monster why would you do that to someone you truly love????just a stupid stupid movie don't waste your time",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
221,joshembry,"A Disgrace to be Called ""Mary Shelley's"" Frankenstein",6,24 November 2019,This movie does not capture the essence of the book whatsoever and completely alters the plot.,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
222,dan-1266,The real monster here is Kenneth Branagh's ego,1,5 April 2007,"DeNiro playing Frankenstein's monster was great idea, and the performance feels true to the character in the book. Sadly it comes off as if he were cut out from another film and pasted into this farce. Seeing it in the theater back in 1994, I was embarrassed for everyone involved except for Branagh, who can share the blame with the producers in making this thing. Grown adults were pointing at the screen and laughing, and not just when John Cleese showed up. His scene was the first unintentionally funny one - Cleese's dour character was straight out of about twenty Python sketches. But the ""birth"" scene, dripping not just with melted jello but with shallow, pointless undercurrents of mother and child and homo-eroticism, was made more ridiculous with comically timed editing. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie. You've got to wonder what people are thinking sometimes when making a horror film - did Branagh, or whoever had final cut of this thing, get chills up their spine at any point? Could they feel anything other than blind, empty sensation? ""Yeah! That does something!"" Yeah, it makes the movie really suck. This movie is a lot of things, mostly a really good lesson in really bad film-making, but it is not scary, nor does it carry any of the message or subtext of Shelly's book. One would like to think that Branagh approached this as an assignment with a big paycheck, which could cut him off from some of the blame, but from his blustery, overstuffed interviews at the time, he took it, and himself, very, very, very, very seriously, and I'm sure he thought he was adding something profound to the great cannon of the Frankenstein legend. What a pompous fraud.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
223,sargefan_1,Way under appreciated,10,29 August 2005,"I was a little at a loss when I saw this movie in the $5.50 bin at walmart with a bunch of other DVD titles involving the almost complete spectrum of Jean Claude Van Damme titles. Anyway, this movie is easily worth way more in entertainment value. I find a lot of people have not even seen this movie or know it has ever existed. First we have a spectacular performance by Robert DeNiro as the creature, one of the early movies of Helana Bohman Carter's Career. I feel it's a better portrait of the novel than any other Frankenstein movie (My apologies to the Karloff Family). More importantly than shock factor this movie stresses the question put out when Mary Shelley put the book out that whether or not Man should not dabble with godlike power unless willing to deal with the full consequences.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
224,NyssaN,Overrated rubbish,3,3 June 2006,"While I give Branagh props for having directed the most accurate Frankenstein movie to date, I believe that it it not right to call this movie ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."" This movie falls short of capturing the essence of the novel ""Frankenstein"" written by Mary Shelleey through the loss and/or alteration of character details, and the complete disregard of the Gothic elements which characterize the novel.The passion and drive of Victor Frankenstein are lost in the movie's attempts to give reason to his madness.The feminist ideas that are presented in the novel are dashed by a washed out version of Elizabeth.Also, because of the period the book was written in, there was a lot of focus on the natural v. unnatural. The book focuses on a lot of scenery for this purpose, and the arctic is supposed to be symbolic of the frigid isolation that first the monster, then Victor feels. This feeling and idea are lost in narrow, shifty camera angles.",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
225,TRielly26-1,Frankenstein,10,20 November 2005,"I just finished reading the novel and watching the film Frankenstein. Watching the film gave me a better appreciation for the novel. The film revealed certain aspects of the book which I could not imagine through the novel. The movie was able to evoke feelings of emotion. I especially liked the scene where the monster is observing the family. The monster is able to recognize the struggle that the family is going through, and is able to lend a helping hand. This shows how the monster was able to develop emotions and feelings. This scene strengthens my humanistic view of the monster. While I was reading the novel it seemed difficult to imagine a monster of that caliber being so caring and kind. Watching the film made me become sympathetic to the monster. The monster was shunned by society for no apparent reason. The monster was hideous, but his purpose was not to bring evil and sorrow to society. I believe that society is to blame for the murders which occurred in this novel. Ultimately Victor Frankenstein is to blame; however society did lend a hand in manipulating Victors mind. Victor became obsessed with the ability to control nature. He wanted to test the laws of life and death.I seem to have two different viewpoints regarding Victor Frankenstein's intentions while conducting his studies. While I was reading the novel I began to get a feeling that Victor wanted to test the scientific theories. He wanted to be a rebel and be the first scientist to break through the norm. He wanted to be revolutionary. His obsession with becoming the first and greatest drove him to insanity. It became his life. The book made it clear that Victor felt life and death could be manipulated. His reasons for investigating this sort of work seemed only to benefit the field of modern science. However, while I was watching the movie I tended to perceive a different viewpoint. The main scene which turned my point of view was the scene where Victor brings Elizabeth back to life. This scene was added for ""theatrical effect,"" however I thought this scene had a great affect on the overall essence of the movie. It made me believe that Victor was playing God. He wanted to hold the same abilities. His interest in investigating modern science was destroyed, and he was using his knowledge for personal gain. I believe watching the movie and reading the novel together gave me a better understanding of the novel. I was able to interpret and understand different aspects of the story due to my exposure to both pieces.Overall I thought that the story was revolutionary. It shed light on new scientific ideas. We are faced with many similar issues today which are presented in this story. For example, is it morally right to clone human beings? Is it morally right to bring the dead back to life? This novel was a revolutionary piece and has had a strong impact on me as a reader and as a member of society. This story made me think about certain issues which we are faced with on a daily basis. Should we leave life and death up to nature or should we test the realms of this science like Victor Frankenstein had?",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
226,info-6637,"Absolutely atrocious - other than the scenery, avoid at all costs",3,24 November 2005,"Yes, I know the movie is almost 12 years old but I've just watched it for the first time and it is quite simply so bad that it prompted me to register just to comment.I gave this movie a 3/10 and that was only for the scenery. The casting and characterisation bothered me from from the opening scenes in the Arctic. I can't help wondering if those involved with the screenplay and casting choices actually read Shelley's Frankenstein or simply read an abridged comic book version.I understand taking certain ""artistic licenses"" when adapting a novel to movie form, especially one written in the 1800's but... in my opinion, this movie went too far.Minor spoilers, only in the first quarter of the movie should serve to illustrate my point: The movie opens in the Artic in 1794. It then flashes back (yes, this is true to the book, besides the names and locations one of the only things that is) to 1793 when Victor leaves for University. This leads the viewer to believe that only the passage of one year was involved between leaving for university, creating the creature and chasing him to the Arctic. For any who have read the book, this is glaringly inaccurate.The second liberty that made me cringe was Henry Clerval. I think Tom Hulce was one of the few good casting choices in the movie but they played too fast and loose with the characters background. In the novel, Henry was Victor's friend in Geneva. Henry wanted to go to university with Victor but Henry's father wanted his son to learn business, not the sciences. Henry does not arrive in Ingolstadt until AFTER Victor gives life to the creature. In the movie, Henry is a student of science who meets Victor for the first time at university.I could go on but I this post would become far too long. I will agree with a prior review I read here that lead to my making this post, the scenery is beautiful but there was no ""complete faithfulness to the story"".",Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
227,gibb-02824,literally just the worst,3,31 October 2018,"This movie takes a dump on everything fantastic about the original story, with the magnum opus of the act being naming it ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.""
