0,SnoopyStyle,out of the hood,4,24 December 2016,"Debo escapes from county jail chained to Tyrone. Debo is looking for revenge against Craig Jones (Ice Cube). Craig's dad sends him to stay with his cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps) in Rancho Cucamonga. His unemployed uncle Elroy won the lottery allowing him to buy a house in the suburbs. Craig gets into some misadventures with his cousin's family and the Latino gangster neighbors as the family faces foreclosure.I'm not saying that Chris Tucker is a magical elixir for any franchise but part of the original charm is the lead characters' friendship. Essentially, this sequel switches out Tucker for Epps. If that's how easy it is to drop a lead character, how much should the audience care about any of the characters. It's a mess of crude broad humor that doesn't hit enough times. Ice Cube has good charisma as lead but there isn't much more than that.",Next Friday
1,nogodnomasters,Rancho Cucomonga,5,17 June 2021,The film gives a quick background of the first one. Deebo has escaped prison and is coming after Ice Cube who lives with his rich uncle and cousin who are going broke. He need money for taxes ASAP and look to robbing the Mexican dealers next door.The film lost some members of the original cast and was replace with toilet humor. The production lost a step as does many sequels.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.,Next Friday
2,Quinoa1984,"Funny, but",6,28 April 2000,"Next Friday has many laughs to go around ,but I felt something was missing in this film.  I know what is missing of course, Chris Tucker.  The young man who made his breakthrough performance as a pot-head who hung out with Craig Jones (Ice Cube) on a memorable day (and film) between Thursday and Saturday.  Now though, the sequel revolves around Craig's family instead of his neighborhood as the first Friday did.  I think wrier/producer/star Cube decided to do that to add a little kick to the Friday saga, and it does. But without Tucker it's a kick from a baby.  Still, the movie isn't the worst ever, it has many laughs from it's supporting characters (John Witherspoon, Mike Epps, Don Curry) who play Craig's odd family.  Cool, hip, and not quite fine.  A-",Next Friday
3,anaconda-40658,Next Lame Day,1,26 April 2015,"Next Friday (2000): Dir: Steve Carr / Cast: Ice Cube, Mike Epps, John Witherspoon, Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister, Tamala Jones: Brainless mess with absolutely no reason for existing. Sequel to Friday with Ice Cube writing and narrating the film. He was responsible for Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister landing in prison but after an escape, Cube is sent to live with his Uncle Elroy. Cube's cousin works at Pinky's Record Store where he hides out on his pregnant girlfriend. Next door live drug dealers with a nasty pit bull. There is a subplot involving taxes and saving the property etc. Witless and predictable with uninspiring directing by Steve Carr. Ice Cube plays the humourless lead, which works against the mood of the film. It is as if Cube arrived on the wrong set. Mike Epps plays Cube's best friend who is a complete idiot. John Witherspoon plays Cube's less than friendly father. Perhaps the worst element is an embarrassing appearance by Lister who breaks out of prison and seeks revenge on Cube. Perhaps he should seek out the producers of this film. Tamala Jones plays Epps's pregnant ex-girlfriend although being part of this film gives her something else to be angry about. The conclusion presents theft and drugs as fun as oppose to the endless trouble brought to those who dabbled in it. Nothing of value in this film that prides itself on being stupid. This film should be tossed in a campfire for a marshmallow roast. Score: 1 / 10",Next Friday
4,StevePulaski,Next Friday Makes for a Good Weekend,8,1 August 2010,"Next Friday is the follow up to successful cult film, Friday. Which seems like an urban sequel to Booty Call more than Friday. This one takes place exactly a week after ""Friday"" did.Next Friday is about Craig Jones (Ice Cube) who reprises his role as Craig, goes to live with his uncle in Cucamonga after the neighborhood bully he beat up escapes from prison. Chris Tucker's character Smokey is said to go to rehab. Mike Epps takes the role of the supporting character, Day-Day, Craig's cousin. Day Day is basically the ""hood"" kinda guy, also denying he's the father of his girlfriend's child. His girlfriend takes many stands trying to beat him up, using her sister Baby D.Meanwhile, the neighborhood bully, Debo, from the first Friday, Escapes from jail trying to hunt down Craig while sneaking in the back of Craig's dads truck. Which they tricked him in driving down to Cucamonga saying Craig was hurt.In the line of ""Good Sequels"" and ""Bad Sequels"", this has it's moment, but its nothing compared to classic ""Friday."" This one tries to have a lot of memoirs to the first movie, which it does, but many are forgettable. Still a decent sequel, I recommend Next Friday, but see the old Friday before this or you will be lost.Starring: Ice Cube, Mike Epps, and John Witherspoon. Directed by: Steve Carr.",Next Friday
5,Smells_Like_Cheese,I actually liked Next Friday a lot better,7,30 December 2006,"My sister lent me the movie ""Friday"" a couple months ago, and I wasn't really too interested in seeing the sequels after being disappointed with the first ""Friday"" movie. But I figured to give Next Friday a chance because one of my friends told me that it was a lot more fun than the first and I agree. I know the rating on IMDb doesn't seem too promising, but believe me, I think that people were just being a little too harsh on the film because it wasn't like the first one.Craig has to stay with his lottery winning uncle and cousin 'till things cool down back home since the bully he took down in the first Friday broke out of prison. Well, Craig and his cousin, Day-Day, get into some crazy situations with Day-Day's ex and the neighbors across the street who are dealing with some heavy stuff. When Craig finds out about his uncle and cousin's house being sold in an auction, he and Day-Day try to find a way to get the money to keep the house.I really laughed a lot more in Next Friday than the first one, as much as I love Chris Tucker, I have to admit that he was somewhat annoying in the first movie, it was nice having a little tone down in this film. But seriously, people need to cut this movie a break because it is a really funny film when you just let go and relax. Well, I hope Friday after Next is just as funny, but we'll see.7/10",Next Friday
6,disdressed12,"not as good as the first film,but still very entertaining",7,8 June 2010,"this second film in the Friday trilogy is a pretty good film.i enjoyed it quite a bit.it's pretty funny at times,though maybe not quite as funny as the first one was.i think they stretched a couple of the jokes too thin.there is one running joke that they milked a bit too much.still the story is interesting.the cast of characters is not quite as large,with only a handful of characters from the first film returning.Ice Cube is back as Craig,and John Witherspoon returns as his Dad,Mr.Jones.there are some new characters,but these are not nearly as quirky or interesting as the characters in the first movie.to me,they seemed a bit stereotypical.overall,though,the movie is funny and entertaining.for me,Next Friday is a 7/10",Next Friday
7,digitalbeachbum,Not bad for a sequel,7,14 September 2021,"This is a squeal to Friday, which was a very funny movie, but this one didn't quite have the same effect. It is still good, but it was lacking some of the Chris Rock. The casting is good and they have some of the same style of comedy. It's worth watching at least once with a good replay value.",Next Friday
8,ExplorerDS6789,Craig is Moving From the Hood to the Burbs to Avoid a Deadly Showdown With Deebo...Next Friday!,8,6 January 2006,"Last Friday, Craig Jones successfully took down the terror of South Central, Deebo. After that, Deebo was sentenced to four years in prison, but vowed to break out and come after Craig...next Friday. Unfortunately, today was next Friday, and Craig still didn't have a job; It seemed like a normal Friday in South Central. Craig was lonely since his homie Smokey went into rehab to get off the weed. After hearing that Deebo and his pal Tyrone escaped from prison, Craig's dad Willie attempted to sneak Craig out of the neighborhood. They luckily evade Deebo just as he was coming to see Craig. They leave the 'hood and head to Rancho Cucamunga where Craig would be staying with his lucky uncle Elroy, who recently won the million dollar Lotto, and his hip cousin Day Day. Willie was jealous of Elroy and didn't come in the house. He just drove off. Elroy was widowed for his wife had a heart attack when they won the Lotto. But, Elroy has since found a new lover, half his age: Suga. She was fine! Their fabulous mansion, or sweet crib, was located at the end of a cul-de-sac across from the Joker gang's house, where Joker, Lil Joker and Baby Joker were up to no good; Day Day's old girlfriend D'Wanna came over and keyed the side of Day Day's pride and joy: his BMW! Meanwhile back in the 'hood, Deebo and Tyrone came up with a plan to find Craig: they called Willie with a phony message that Craig was in trouble and just as he was hurrying out to help him, they sneak a ride in back of his truck.For Craig, life in the 'burbs was different than life in the 'hood. But that's when he met a hot lil' woman named Karla, the sister of the Jokers'. Unfortunately Joker didn't like seeing the two of them together so he sicked his pit bull Cheeco on Craig; after that, Day Day left for work at Pinky's Records & Discs. Uncle Elroy and Suga get high and encourage Craig to join them. Afterwards they go upstairs, when a postman brings a delivery notice. Craig learns that Elroy was behind on his taxes. He owed $3,900 or the house would be auctioned off. Elroy was too ""busy"" to notice, so Craig went to see Day Day about it. Day Day and his colleague Roach had a difficult customer to deal with, but Craig knocked some sense into him. Worse to come: D'Wanna showed up with her big little sister Baby D'. She was ready to tear Day Day limb from limb, however she had developed the hots for Craig and would let Day Day go if she could talk to Craig. Craig wanted no part of it, so Baby D' and D'Wanna smash Day Day's car window and leave. To think clearly, Day Day, Roach and Craig light up a joint in the stock room. Thanks to Elroy and Day Day's careless spending, they didn't have the $3,900. The only question was how to get it? Unfortunately, right then Pinky, the owner of the store showed up and took Craig to be a robber. There was a scuffle, and Day Day and Roach were fired.When they get home, Day Day shows Elroy the notice, which upset him. But what really upset him was that Day Day got fired from his job; The Joker gang return home then, running over Roach's skateboard in the process. That's when Craig noticed Joker carrying a hydraulic cannister full of...Money? Craig makes a plan with Day Day and Roach to get that cannister. That night, they make their move. Also, Willie finally arrives; Roach is told to distract Cheeco while Craig slips into the house to get the cannister. Joker, Lil Joker and Baby Joker were partying with some really HOT senoritas! Craig escaped out the window, luckily. Meanwhile, Roach gets Cheeco stoned from a ""special"" brownie, then he and Day Day try to go inside the house and check on Craig when they find themselves captured. Craig returns to Elroy's house, then he makes a plan to rescue Day Day and Roach. Willie and Elroy help. They manage to knock out Baby Joker and Lil Joker, but still had psycho Joker to worry about. He and Craig get it on in hand-to-hand combat. Just then, Deebo and Tyrone break out of Willie's truck, enter the backyard and knock out Joker. Deebo prepares for his long awaited fight with Craig, when suddenly the police arrive. Deebo, Tyrone, Baby Joker, Lil Joker and Joker were incarcerated. Roach went home with his new best friend Cheeco; As for Craig, after one day in the 'burbs, he decided to return home to the 'hood. With the money they got from Joker, Elroy would be able to keep the house. Craig said goodbye to Elroy, Suga and Day Day and returned home with Willie to good ol' South Central.Next Friday. Man, this was a funny movie! Hilarious. Ice Cube is back as Craig and as funny as ever. Mike Epps joins the cast as hip, but dim-witted Day Day. John Witherspoon returns as Willie. Tom ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr. is back as Deebo, the sexy Lisa Rodriguez is Karla, Jacob Vargas is Joker, and Clifton Powell is deranged Pinky. Justin Pierce plays Roach and unfortunately he passed away in 2000 by suicide. Chris Tucker does not return as Smokey, however. Oh well. Maybe in a future Friday film. After this one came Friday After Next, which I'll definitely have to see. In conclusion, Next Friday is da bomb. It is funny from start to finish. There's a lot of F-word usage here, which makes it all the more funny. So if you like Ice Cube or movies about the 'hood or you saw the first Friday, then by all means see Next Friday today! I recommend it, for all the homies in the family!-",Next Friday
9,gangstahippie,Worst of the trilogy but still pretty funny and good,8,13 June 2007,"Rated R for Language,Drug Use and Sexual Content.Next Friday is the sequel to the movie Friday and the second movie in the trilogy.Friday and Friday After Next were very funny movies.This one was not as funny but did have some really funny moments and was overall a fun and entertaining film.In this one, Craig moves to the suburbs with his rich uncle Elroy and his cousin Day Day.The reason he moves out of his old neighborhood is because Deebo has broken out of jail and wants revenge on Craig for beating him up(this happened in the first movie).There are some more funny characters in this movie such as Pinky the owner of the record store that Day Day works at and the three Mexican brothers who like to start trouble.Next Friday may not be as good as the first or third Friday movie but it is still funny and worth watching.8/10",Next Friday

11,DunnDeeDaGreat,Actually quite funny without Chris Tucker,10,16 March 2002,Next Friday is actually pretty funny even though it lacks the film's first scene stealer Chris Tucker. Ice Cube makes a funny script with the help of new scene stealer Mike Epps who plays his cousin Day-Day. All in all if you just want a good time check this one out.,Next Friday
12,blott2319-1,"Offensive and stupid, but with a bit more structure than the first one.",3,18 June 2020,"Next Friday is somewhat less annoying than its predecessor. It feels like this movie is trying to assemble a bit more plot, so I'll give it credit for that. However, it's not structured all that well to tell its story. Instead, this movie feels like a bunch of vignettes that are trying to be humorous. I still wasn't laughing this time, but I could understand where others might. There are several running gags that keep coming back in Next Friday, and I feel like they could work to make the right audience laugh out loud, even though I was a bit bored by them all. For me, this movie is sorely missing Chris Tucker. He was the only thing that even made me chuckle in Friday, so losing him for Next Friday was a big blow. Mike Epps brings nothing to the table, at least in terms of comedic energy, and he plays an obnoxious character. His father and the father's girlfriend aren't much better, and they keep popping up throughout the film.One thing I feel like I need to mention is how offensive this movie seems. It plays into so many racial stereotypes that it kind of made me uncomfortable. I didn't mention anything when I saw this stuff in Friday, because it was basically 100% black people in that film, so I dismissed it as one of those things I don't have the right to question. At the time it felt like when a black person says the N-word, because it's ok for them to say it, but not for others to even think it. But in Next Friday it's not just a black cast, they are adding in offensive Latin stereotypes, and it pushed me too far. It's not funny, and it isn't the kind of thing that should make people laugh, that's for sure. On the flip side, I think what made this sequel a bit more tolerable, and what got me to crack a smile a few times, was the physical comedy. There were some decent pratfalls and other goofy gags that work. Yet, even though Next Friday wasn't completely miserable to watch, it's safe to say the stoner-comedy genre isn't ideal for me.",Next Friday
13,mattymatt4ever,Delivers another good batch of laughs,7,17 April 2001,"This sequel doesn't work quite as effectively as the original--Of course, we don't have Smokey this time around--but I laughed a lot.  Watching it a second time around, I found it pretty dull, but the first time I liked it. Mike Epps is very funny as Cube's cousin.  John Witherspoon also provides some good supporting laughs.  And I liked the uncle--I'm not sure what his name is, but I've seen him before.  The jokes get repetitive at times, sometimes lame, sometimes just all-out crude, but they're often effective. Cube is a good writer, and he came up with such original lines like, ""You ever heard of El Nino?"" ""Yes.""  ""Well, this is El Negro.""  There were many wacky moments where I laughed hard, like the one with Pinky, the owner of a music store who comes to work in a limo and struts around like a pimp. 
""Next Friday"" is no ""Annie Hall.""  The comedy falls flat at times and the humor isn't exactly classy, but I got enough laughs to recommend it.  It's better than a lot of sequels I've seen.",Next Friday
14,Shopaholic35,It's OK.,4,6 February 2014,"""Next Friday"" has the same slacker attitude as the first movie ""Friday"" with a little more plot line. The big disappointment is the lack of Chris Tucker as he was a big drawcard for the first movie. Once again this movie is completely watchable although it does edge into sequel territory where the storyline feels more worked and less organic in it's development. Also the characters weren't as good and felt typical to this style of movie.Not a bad effort as a sequel but it misses the mark. It's lucky it is connected to a cult hit or it would not have been as successful (and I use that term lightly).",Next Friday
15,drpainters,It's okay sequel,6,20 April 2020,"Decent enough to watch but a step down from the original. Some of the new characters just aren't as good, would of been better if they had kept in same neighborhood.",Next Friday
16,BrickNash,"Has its moments, but there's too much missing of what made the first film a classic.",5,21 March 2019,"The original Friday trod the line, film and stoner comedy with absolute perfection and it deserves it's reputation as a true classic.This sequel unfortunately loses far too many elements of the first film, including one if it's main draws - Chris Tucker. Tucker did not return for the follow up and that's definitely a bad thing because he was without a doubt a huge part of what made the original work. Taking the action away from the original neighbourhood into a plush suburb removes any feeling of familiarity as many of the colourful background characters and supporting cast members we've come to know just aren't there.It's not a bad film by any means, but it's no where near as intelligent or well executed as the first movie. Ice Cube takes sole credit as writer on this project and while the film has more than a few laughs it feels a lot flatter and more obvious in both story and dialogue.One wonders why they even bothered if so much of what made the first film work was missing, but it's worth a watch at least (as long as you reign in your expectations).",Next Friday

19,Lando_Hass,Extremely funny!,10,15 October 2002,"Next Friday, is by far the best comedy film out there today. This time, Craig moves out of the ghetto, and into the suburbs, mainly because his dad fears that Deebo will come after Craig. Deebo has escaped from jail, and he is out to find Craig. Craig's father sends him to live with his uncle, and cousin ""Day-Day"". That basically sums up the story line. What made this film so funny, is the three ""Jokers"", and facial expressions. This movie has lots of funny jokes, and clever lines. Mike Epps' character, ""Day-Day"", is probably the most unique character in the film next to ""Joker"". I loved the screenplay for this film, mainly because it had clever lines, and funny jokes. Next Friday also has some pretty good acting, which in general make the movie even funnier. This, I think is, Mike Epps' first film, and I have to say that he did a damn good job for a first film. Like I said earlier in this review, most of the comedy comes from facial expressions, and clever jokes. I would have to say, that the funniest facial expression in this film, was when Mike Epps' character is first introduced. The character ""Joker"", is the funniest part of the film. Every time a joke comes out of his mouth, or any word for that matter, will make you laugh. When I first heard of this film, I really anticipated that it was pure crap, but then I saw it on TV, and I was proved wrong. This movie kicks ass. 10 out of 10.",Next Friday
20,Rooster99,This is the worst movie ever made.,1,10 April 2001,"This movie is painfully bad.  I ended up sitting through it just to see if there was even one scene that might make me chuckle.  Just one..... and there wasn't.  It is so stupid it will make you feel ripped off even if someone walked up and gave it to you.  You will feel like you wasted 90 minutes of your life.There is not a single funny scene in the entire movie.  It centers around Ice Cube going to visit his uncle, who had recently won the lottery.  He hangs out with his moronic friend Day-Day and they try to be funny with a long series of boring, tired, done-a-million-times jokes on drugs, sex and flatulence.I cannot believe that someone who is supposed to have some talent such as Ice Cube could have written such trash.  And who in the world would have produced this film?  Why it would have to be Ice Cube himself since no one else with any sense or taste would have touched it.  This is, without doubt, the all-time worst movie ever made.  I think you should all go and rent it (was it ever in the theaters?) just to see how bad films can be. Congratulations Ice, a new low!",Next Friday
21,pooh-24,It Was A Bad Day,1,13 October 2001,"Next Friday is one of the worst films ever made.Starring rap ""star"" Ice Cube,this is an awful film portraying black people as a bunch of lazy,stupid,indecent,trashy goofballs with no purpose in life but indulging in sex,drugs,money,and pleasure.No character in the film,including Ice Cube's own character,is anybody that you would care about when watching the ""film"".The attempts at humor fall way short of O'Shea Jackson's(Ice Cube's real name) means of achieving them.It is just a ugly feature film filled with vulgarity,violence,poor taste,and ebonics,showing blacks in a terrible light. Most American blacks are in no way shape or form  what one sees portrayed here in Next Friday,but the movie is heavyhanded in its' demeaning portrayal of black people and the filmmakers seem not to care that it is.One hopes Next Friday is the Last Friday to be made.",Next Friday

23,Sam_Gray,the original was much better,3,1 March 2000,"Wow.  What a miscalculation on the parts of Ice Cube and D.J. Pooh.  The first Friday was hilarious, but I only laughed a few times with this movie. While others might cite the lack of Chris Tucker as this movie's major failing, I think the problem is much more fundamental than that.  In the first Friday, Craig himself is funnier, as are all the bit players.  Here, no one really has anything interesting to say or do at all.Clifton Powell's turn as Pinky is by far the funniest thing in this movie. Otherwise, there isn't much going on.

When I watched Next Friday yesterday, I thought it was pretty good... for a So-So movie hehe... Of course not as good as Friday and Friday After Next but I got a good laugh out of it, and now I think of it a so-so highly. Of course Smokey should have been there too but, anyways, at least there's Day Day but it shows a character from a different perception and Day Day is a funny guy but Smokey is one of the best characters in any movie.

26,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,Skip This Friday!,1,25 March 2013,"After seeing the first Friday film and enjoying it, I expected this sequel to while not living up to the first, to be an enjoyable comedy that would serve up a decent amount of laughs.This film is the equivalent of an Araon Seltzer and Jason Friedberg movie where the film has no plot and the humor is solely based around swearing and being vulgar, except it's all irritating and not funny in the slightest. The film may have been more tolerable if the characters were actually likable, but they are all annoying and unlikeable. Mike Epps was a terrible addition to the cast and is neither funny or a good actor. There's nothing good about this film and it should be avoided at all cost. Even if you are a fan of the first film.

28,Kilroy-17,They should have quit while they were ahead...,5,17 January 2000,"Just like Back to the Future and Ghostbusters and Major League, this ""part two"" should have stayed off the screen.  What made Friday such a good movie was its originality combined with the credibility of the antics that anyone who lived in a similar neighborhood could relate to or maybe even remember. Any sequel seems as though it could only fall short of that.Next Friday is a clear attempt to use the formula behind the original. Change the scenery and the jokes -- poof -- movie.  Craig is off to stay with his lottery winning uncle in the suburb of Rancho Cucamonga.  He's leaving because they get news that Deebo is planning to break out of prison and come take revenge on Craig (Deebo's been there since Craig knocked him the @#$% out).Deebo does break out of prison.  You see him and another inmate coming over a fence using bed sheets tied together.  This is onto a main street and the two men are chained together at the ankles.  That's not to mention their bright orange prison wear.  Yet no one seems to notice or care.  They proceed to run around looking for Craig until they happen upon Craig's father in his dog catcher's truck.  They let out all the dogs and hop in. Mr. Jones, the dog catcher, gets swarmed by dogs as he walks back to his truck.  He simply ignores all the loose dogs.  These are the kinds of credibility problems that you didn't have in Friday.  You could kind of see where this movie was written with Chris Tucker in mind, but they couldn't afford him so Smokey was written off to rehab and Smokey's parts were handed off to Day-Day.The plot is thin and most of it is unbelievable.  I knew it was not going to be as good as the first one.  When I realized just how bad it had a chance to be, I just started listening for some good jokes.  There was quite a few chuckles, several laughs, and two deep belly-laughs with eyes closed.  Out of four stars, this one gets half a star.",Next Friday
29,maartenvankrimpen,One of the funniest movies I'v ever seen,8,4 April 2003,"Yes, I do think this is a very funny movie. Although the critics are terribly bad, I like this movie. Before I saw this movie, I didn't see the first one. I didn't even know that there was a first movie. The story is kind of bad, the acting is also not very good (especially the guy who plays Roach), but it's so funny. The swearing, very exaggerated, is brilliant, and Jacob Vargas is at his best. Geweldige film (Great movie in Dutch)!",Next Friday
30,jnelso19,Lower Your Expectations and Enjoy,8,29 December 2012,"Gotta be honest when I first saw this movie, I expected it to be total crap with Chris Tucker no longer a part of the cast. Saying that, I also believe that's the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Granted this is definitely the worst of the three Friday films with some good reason. Some of the jokes seemed kind of forced and in some cases the film seemed to be overacted (You'll see what I mean when you meet the neighbors). Despite that, Ice Cube wrote a solid screenplay that shows that even in the suburbs, things can get crazy. Mike Epps' crazy ex was excellent along with the treatment that she gives to him over the course of the day. That ugly dog was hilarious particularly in the second half of the movie. Not to mention the weed jokes (sorry to those who don't like 'em, I'm a sucker for 'em, personal experience I guess haha but I digress). Plus when you see a fine lady in the film you can't help but to give it a couple extra points.
