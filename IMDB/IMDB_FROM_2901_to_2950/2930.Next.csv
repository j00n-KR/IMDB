0,Leofwine_draca,"A bad film, even by Cage's standards...",3,14 December 2012,"Nicolas Cage made two similar movies in which he played characters who could see into the future. KNOWING, which came out in 2009, and NEXT, made two years earlier in 2007. KNOWING is a great little film with some decent set pieces. NEXT is, simply, horrible.The problem, as per usual, seems to be with the script, which attempts to mix up the action and sci-fi genres and comes across as rather hopeless. Cage is a guy who can see a couple of minutes into the future, so the FBI try to use him to track down a criminal gang. Oh, and along the way he finds time to romance Jessica Biel, who looks like his daughter rather than a love interest.Poor Nic gets a lot of flak for his appearances in cheesy movies, but sometimes he deserves it. He appears vacant here, his acting risible on occasion. But then the other cast members are equally poor: Biel is wooden and awkward, and Julianne Moore appears to be sleepwalking through her turn.Some of the action bits should be entertaining, but I just didn't care enough about the film to enjoy watching them. NEXT adopts a slapdash approach to the material that makes it impossible to take seriously. Kiwi director Lee Tamahori has to take some of the blame; films like ALONG CAME A SPIDER, DIE ANOTHER DAY and XXX 2 all display the same traits of flashy inepititude.",Next
1,SnoopyStyle,intriguing idea with little problems and wtf ending,3,20 July 2016,"Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is cheesy Vegas magician Frank Cadillac. In his spare time, he wins small amounts at the casinos. He does this by seeing into the future by about two minutes. FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is tracking him hoping to use his skills for the government especially with a stolen Russian nuke on the loose in L.A. Cris uses his power to woo stranger Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel) who has a special connection and affect on him.The idea is intriguing and the movie does it well at times. It works to some extend until it does one of the worst cheating ending ever. There are problems even before the ending. It's the little things like Nick Cage's stringy long hair. It would be great to have an opening exposition of Cris' powers during his childhood. His 36 consecutive hours story is a good one to do. Jessica Biel is hot but him sleeping with her so quickly cheapens their connection. It's got good and bad until the ending. The end is simply a cheat.",Next
2,Hitchcoc,Sometimes you just get in too deep!,7,31 August 2007,"While I enjoyed the premise of this film, I felt like I so often do. You've got this neat idea; what are you going to do with it? Nicolas Cage plays a man who can see two minutes into the future, which allows him to move to different places to avoid danger, protect people in danger, and so on. The problem comes with the immutability of time. If you change things, what you saw really wasn't true; hence the plot hole. It was fun watching him dodge bullets and punches. What is hard to swallow is the mind that can put order to all this. Is this going on constantly or can he truly control it. If the mystery is out of his life, can he know the mystery. Part of my problem is that I never really understood what the bad guys were up to (I don't mean on a grander scale but on the details). Cage's relationship with Biel is nice but can he even have a relationship. The two minute thing was convenient. What if it had been a half hour or a day. How would that affect things. Anyway, when the ending comes, it seems satisfying but sad.Someone said that people booed at the end. I'm sure it's because for some people, leaving a little too much to imagination is quite a stretch. It was a fun couple hours, but one shouldn't think too much. As for Philip K. Dick, he can provoke us pretty well.",Next
3,claudio_carvalho,Remember the Future in a Great Action Movie,8,17 February 2008,"When a group of terrorists threatens to explode a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles, FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) sees in the Las Vegas magician and smalltime crook Cris Johnson a.k.a. Frank Cadillac (Nicolas Cage) the hope to find where the device is hidden. Cris has the ability to foresee and change his future up to two minutes ahead, but is not receptive to the government proposal afraid of the experiments he was submitted when he was a child. While escaping from FBI, Cris meets the gorgeous Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel) in a cafeteria and he recalls that he had dreamed on her. Liz offers a lift to Cris and they immediately fall in love for each other. But agent Ferris wants to force Cris to help her at any cost while Liz is abducted by the terrorists.""Next"" is one of the best action movies I have recently seen, with an excellent and unpredictable story of the awesome Philip K. Dick; gripping screenplay with many twists that inclusive provides a hook for a possible sequel; and fine performances of three of my favorite contemporary actors and actresses: the sensational Nicolas Cage, the wonderful Julianne Moore and the sweet Jessica Biel. I really liked a lot the hilarious sequence when Cris is ""studying"" the best way to approach to Liz in the restaurant. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Vidente"" (""The Fortuneteller"")",Next
4,lee_eisenberg,hard to believe that we once assumed that Nicolas Cage was going to be a serious actor,4,9 July 2018,"After ""Leaving Las Vegas"" got released and Nicolas Cage won an Oscar for it, lots of people assumed that he would be a doyen of cerebral movies. Lo and behold, his repertoire since then has been a series of brainless flicks. ""Next"" is one of them, starring Cage as a man who can see into the future. Totally predictable. I do NOT recommend it.",Next
5,jboothmillard,Next,4,25 August 2013,"I saw bits and pieces of a trailer for this film, I knew the lead actor and that it was something to do with time travel or seeing things before they happen, it was only later I found out it was based on a book by Phillip K. Dick, but before that I was looking forward to it whatever, from director Lee Tamahori (Along Came a Spider, Die Another Day). Basically Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is a Las Vegas entertainer who under the stage name Frank Cadillac performs magic tricks, but these are the result of a condition he has been haunted with ever since childhood, he can see things two minutes before they actually happen, in various alternatives for different results. The FBI are intrigued by Cris's abilities on stage, but realise they may not be just tricks, and agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is looking to recruit him for the latest threat to the country, a terrorist has stolen a nuclear bomb and is planning to detonate it somewhere in Los Angeles, so the authorities want the magician to use his power to find it. Wanting to avoid the government and medical examinations he had to go through as a child he refuses to be any part of this investigation, and does everything he can to escape them, going so far as to use his insight to escape from the cops and anyone trying to track him. In hiding Cris meets Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel), and in his various approaches finds the right one to get to know her, and they officially become an item, but this may be threatened when Ferris approaches her and tries to convince her that he is a dangerous sociopath, so that she will help the cops catch him for their search for the bomb. Cris realises that Liz tries to drug her, and after convincing her of his ability to see into the future he explains that he cannot possibly be any help to finding a bomb, because his insight is only from his own personal experience and perspective, not that of anything else going on anywhere else. After attempting to escape again Ferris manages to bring Cris in, but it appears he will be forced into working with them, because while he left Liz she was kidnapped by the terrorists as bait to bring him out into the open and kill him to stop any potential threat to the police stopping their bomb scare. Cris manages to track down where the bomb will be by watching the news and envisioning the situation of Liz, so he, Ferris and the cops scope the area that will have the bomb detonate, battling the various terrorists and criminals in a shoot out, and they manage to save the girl, but he realises he has made a mistake, the bomb was moved and it explodes out at sea, destroying the city. But then Cris wakes up, he dreamt the whole incident up to the point he and Liz were in the motel, everything after that could be his future, so knowing that Liz could get involved with the future he comes out into the open, he accepts joining Ferris, knowing what he knows, but Cris asks that Liz be no part of it, but before leaving, he tells her to wait for him. Also starring Thomas Kretschmann as Mr. Smith, Peter Falk as Irv, Tory Kittles as Cavanaugh, Jim Beaver as NSA Director Wisdom, José Zúñiga as Security Chief Roybal, Michael Trucco as Kendall and Enzo Cilenti as Mr. Jones. Cage gives a relatively good performance as the man who see a couple of minutes into his own and near out of the way future, and Moore is suitable as the leading agent determined to recruit him, Biel is alright and looks beautiful, the story is clever seeing the lead character going through the various experiences involving threat and potential death, the special effects for the flash forwards are impressive, I admit the film feels a little flat sometimes and repetitive in moments, but overall I thought it was an alright and reasonably entertaining science-fiction thriller. Okay!",Next
6,rmax304823,Leaves You Numb.,5,4 January 2009,"An action movie with a gimmick. Nicholas Cage is a Las Vegas illusionist who actually has the power to see into the future -- but only insofar as the events are connected with his own body sheath. He can tell, for instance, if he's about to be hit by a car while crossing the street, and thus avoid it, but he can't tell if somebody else a block away is about to be run over.A gang of international terrorists has smuggled a nuclear device into the United States and is going to demolish a city. The FBI, chiefly in the rather attractive form of the no-nonsense agent in charge, Julianne Moore, once they find out, are naturally enough interested in enlisting the help of Cage. He's reluctant, for reasons having to do with adding some tension to the plot, but finally agrees after the FBI track him down, capture him, and convince him of his misperception of the circumstances. Oh -- and Jessica Biel is thrown into the mix to provide Cage with a threatened girl friend and a bit of sex.The movie is directed at a frenetic pace. The music pounds us into insensibility. The action is speeded up and the camera revolves around Cage's figure like a manic merry-go-round. But all this is to be expected in an action movie designed to hold your breath until you feel dizzy.We get to know virtually nothing about the dozen or so young terrorists, male and female, who want to destroy us. None has a dog or a stamp collection. I keep thinking of how Hitchcock handled villains. Hitchcock's villains, even in his most patriotic and simple-minded films, were always interesting and highly individuated. The polite Nazis in ""Saboteur"" and James Mason's suave heavy in ""North by Northwest."" These guys are just devoted nihilists, no more than that. The only thing of interest about them is the language they speak. This varies from one dumb action movie to another, and it's always revealing to follow their evolution in Hollywood scripts. For years after World War II, they spoke German. During the Cold War they became Russians. After the collapse of the USSR they morphed into Spanish-speaking cocaine drug lords from ""the cartel."" More recently, they've begun speaking Arabic and looking vaguely Middle Eastern. (Sometimes there were retrograde dips: the gang of thugs in ""Die Hard"" spoke German with Russian accents.) This particular gang speaks three languages. English -- but with a British accent -- German, and French. The first two are traditional in the genre. But French? When did they become terrorists, and how do you say ""freedom fries"" in French? In any case, whatever language they happen to be speaking, with whatever accents, they are dismissable except as plot engines, their animus driving the story along at breakneck speed.Fast, yes, but confusing too. Cage is leading the FBI agents through one of those warehouses with lots of catwalks and plumes of steam. He can tell when a sniper is around the corner by imagining himself turning the corner and being shot. But then, with no fanfare, he goes overboard and begins purposefully imagining himself turning both right AND left at the same time, to see what will happen to him in either case. Soon enough, he is morphing in his mind into three or four Nicolas Cages striding off in different directions, and each of these splits again into three or four. By the end of this sequence there are more than a dozen Cages scurrying around in this warehouse, each independent of the other, and each representing a possible future that the ORIGINAL Cage, half a mile back there, is imagining. And -- are you keeping this straight? Because there were times when to me they began to make the same impression as a horde of cockroaches scurrying away from a fruitcake.This movie is not the type that will deny the viewer the catharsis of a nuclear explosion that demolishes Los Angeles and kills all the principles, so don't worry about that. However, after we have the satisfaction of viewing the cataclysm, the camera takes us back to Cage lying in bed beside his girl friend. It's all been in his mind. (Whew.) He immediately contacts Moore and tells her he's made a mistake. They have to adopt a different approach because once you change the future, that changes everything. I suppose this is his version of ""the grandfather paradox"" of time travel. If you go back into the past and murder your own grandfather before he has had a chance to reproduce, how can you exist? But does it apply to the future? The answer isn't self evident, and the whole thing is dismissed with Cage's offhand dictum. It's the last line in the movie, and it's a cop out. But then the whole movie is nothing more than a high-concept cop out.I kind of enjoyed seeing it -- once. I often enjoy action movies. They aren't high art. They're not the Guggenheim Museum or the Brooklyn Bridge. They're vernacular art, like a colorful and ergonomic gas station. We need both, but ""Next"" is more like some sprawling wooden shack all by itself at a dusty crossroads, with decrepit gas pumps in front and a sign, ""Red's Pit Stop and Car Wash."" But there's a cardboard sign tacked to the door, ""Closed Due to Exhaustion."" I think at this point I should either quit or ask the waitress for a fresh analogy.",Next
7,moonspinner55,Big Hollywood money slavering after a concept...a high-tech turkey,1,4 August 2010,"Philip K. Dick's short story ""The Golden Man"" becomes another expensive, explosive, idiotic Hollywood action movie, without an inventive idea anywhere. Ratty-haired Las Vegas lounge magician Nicolas Cage is tapped by FBI agent Julianne Moore to aid in the search for terrorists who plan to set off a nuclear weapon. Why? Because he is an actual clairvoyant who can see two minutes into the future (how's that for a novelty?). By showing the viewer different scenarios of a particular situation (such as a lumbering one set around a fight in a diner), director Lee Tamahori probably figured he was tinkering cleverly with our expectations of the ultimate outcome. Unfortunately, the central character as played by Cage isn't very charming or interesting, so, instead of being suspenseful, the film merely tests our patience. Cage keeps his overly-tanned face slack--like a blank slate--and his movements nervous and jumpy; he admirably doesn't try to sell this galumphing misfire as a character study, and yet he doesn't do anything fresh (he simply coasts). Cage has been to Vegas on film before, of course, and maybe needs a new venue in which to stretch his acting muscles. ""Next"" is a dead-end for all concerned. * from ****",Next
8,blanche-2,magic to do,7,26 January 2013,"Nicholas Cage, Julianne Moore, and Jessica Biel star in ""Next,"" a 2007 action film directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Gary Goldman, Jonathan Hensleigh, and Paul Birnbaum.Cris Johnson (Cage) is a magician named ""Frank Cadillac."" What people don't know is that Johnson has a unique gift: he can see up to two minutes into the future as long as it impacts him personally. There is just one exception: the girl of his dreams (Biel). He's seen her and he's waiting to meet her.Johnson has come to the attention of the FBI, led by Moore. There is a nuclear munitions shipping coming into the U.S., and they want Johnson's helping in locating it. One night, in a casino, he overcomes a would-be robber and grabs his gun, as he saw into the future when the man not only robbed the casino, but shot the young woman at the payout window. However, the police attempt to arrest him, thinking the gun is his; the FBI knows differently. With his two-minute warnings, Johnson is able to get away in a stolen car and go officially on the run. Not only does the FBI want him, but the munitions people as well.I found this film very entertaining with some neat effects as it plays with past and future, sometimes advancing the plot ahead by mere seconds. Nicholas Cage is always great, and he is here as the beleaguered magician who has come to the attention of the casino because they suspect him of cheating.It's a good cast, and the late Peter Falk has a cameo, another treat.I didn't catch the reviews when this film came out nor did I do more than glance at a few here on IMDb. But this is an action film. In action films, one enjoys the action and doesn't dwell on the plot nor delve too deeply into it. After all, the basic premise and action sequences in some of these films can be absurd. So just go with it and have fun. That's what I do, anyway.",Next
9,Quinoa1984,"tries, but is too mediocre and ordinary a thriller to get fun bad-movie leverage",5,10 May 2007,"I knew going into Next that it probably wouldn't be totally similar to Philp k. Dick's original short story the Golden Man (matter of fact after checking out the synopsis of the story in comparison with the final product here they're only similar in that they both have characters who can see into the future and may or may not be under the control of the government), yet what remains here is an intriguing premise squandered mostly by someone who's more of a by-the-books Hollywood director, Lee Tamahori, who tries too much to make Next a conventional a thriller as possible almost in spite of its awesomely bad-movie tendencies. Nicolas Cage plays the title character, a magician in Vegas named Frank Cadillac (named after two of his favorite things, Frankenstein and Cadillacs, a rather ludicrous explanation but why not), and who just wants to stay under the radar, even as he's fully aware of his own special gift: he can see approximately two minutes into his own future, what is directly around him at the time, and can stop it almost in spite of the fact that merely looking at it changes it in a way.There's two story lines competing for attention here, one is something that was probably on the leftover counter of the 80s action-thriller picture where the US government will stop at nothing to squash dirty Russian terrorists with no real demands except to set off nuclear madness. The other is the romantic sidebar with Cage and Jessica Biel, whom he gets involved with in a strange way in that he's seen her in the future long before other events; at first she just finds him odd, then when the news is broken to him she has to re-think things, though of course not for long. Unlike other Dick adaptations, this one doesn't take place in the future, however it limits more of the possibilities for the science-fiction subversion for heavily gun-toting, high-flying chase and battle sequences that are just marginally satisfying and usually just this side of, well, bland. What does make it sort of watchable though is Cage, who has that ""determined"" look on his face, and is only expressive enough as time will allow (one scene where he does get into some expression is ironic since his eyes are opened wide ala Clockwork Orange to test for the government what he can see).Other possibilities from the original text are left out in lieu of decisions in the script and the direction that do, however, carry along many unintentionally entertaining aspect (or maybe intentional, who knows with the motley crew of writers they've assembled for the screenplay). Certain lines are hilarious in just how they can be uttered seriously in a movie (i.e. Biel and Cage in bed, sleepily she says ""Maybe there is such a thing as destiny""), or in little twists that Frank makes as he always is one step ahead of what will happen, like in the pick-up scene in the diner, or, more uproariously funny (at least to me), when he splits up into multiple versions of the same character during the climactic cat & mouse game in the bowels of the boat (yes, multiple versions, as we see him cheat every scenario that he could possibly enter). There's even something sudden and exciting about seeing situations, albeit not to be, where the hero fails and the girl dies in a big bang. But even the possibilities here of this being a follow-up in a sense to Cage's previous starring vehicle, Ghost Rider, in making this a guilty pleasure, get squashed because, frankly, Tamahori is satisfied with just staying square enough with little rip-off moments (intro to Vegas via Ocean's Eleven), bland action (surprising coming from Julianne Moore), and a somewhat tepid romance between Biel and Cage. The use of visual effects is also a little deterring.But to say that it's neither a very good movie or a very bad movie is besides the point. Next is an example of run-of-the-mill theatrics with more involving underlying elements, of questions raised about the responsibility of a person with clairvoyance to the public and those closest to him, and the more cheesy bits of braggadocio, not being paid more attention than the usual mainstream aims. A shame, though it might get a few minutes of viewing time by me when it pops up on cable.",Next

We see cars crashing and all sorts of wood flying away causing havoc.Julianne Moore, a fine actress, does an excellent job as a tough enforcement agent. Surprised to see that Russia is involved in the terrorist plot rather than the conventional middle eastern countries. The film is fast-paced and there is a romantic side to it once Cage involves a lady, who in turn is recruited by the CIA to capture Cage.

The film moves along with just enough speed to keep you watching in a ""This isn't very good but I'm curious how it comes out"" sort of way. I'm sure thats a ringing endorsement somewhere, but for my money and ten bucks a head at the local theater I'd wait to stumble on this on cable.I have to beat on the cast before I end this post. Cage isn't all that good, he wears the same expression for the entire film. He's not bad, but he's probably not the one who should have starred in this mess. Julianne Moore is completely wrong in a role thats seems to have been lifted from sequences in other movies. Jessica Beil looks good but has nothing to do.

Cage may be 10 years younger than me, but he looked 10-15 years older in this movie and it just would not be possible that Cooper would be offering a ride to someone that looked like a loser.That aside, the movie was interesting and kept you wondering what would happen next with his skill/curse. Julianne Moore (The Hours, Boogie Nights) was exceptionally good as the FBI agent trying to catch Johnson and use him to prevent a terrorist act. It might have been more useful in the movie to build a little back-story into the terrorists motivations instead of wasting the time with the highly improbably relationship between Johnson and Cooper.",Next
15,zardoz-13,"""NEXT"" is not the next level in excitement",6,10 May 2007,"Hollywood has been taking liberties with the science fiction stories of acclaimed author Philip K. Dick since 1982 when helmer Ridley Scott turned Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" into the futuristic, landmark, cult favorite ""Blade Runner"" with Harrison Ford as a bounty hunter tracking down human-looking robots. While the stories have been altered inevitably to accentuate the sex and violence, the Arnold Schwarzenegger epic ""Total Recall"" (1990), the Tom Cruise actioneer ""Minority Report"" (2002) and Asian director John Woo's whirl with ""Paycheck"" (2003) qualify as more respectable adaptations than such half-baked misfires as the Peter Weller saga ""Screamers"" (1995) about killing machines run amok on an alien planet and the 2002 Gary Sinise alien look-alike thriller ""Impostor."" The lightweight but predictable new Nicolas Cage action-thriller ""Next"" (** out of ****) draws its inspiration superficially from the 1954 Dick short story ""The Golden Man"" about a fair-haired mutant who takes advantage of his ability to see into the future to elude the authorities that are determined to capture and kill him. Scenarists Gary Goldman of ""Total Recall,"" Jonathan Hensleigh of ""Armageddon,"" and Paul Bernbaum of ""The A-Team"" have overhauled the plot and retuned it as a contemporary suspense yarn about nuclear terrorism in America. Ultimately, ""Next"" falls between better Dick adaptations like either ""Blade Runner"" or ""Paycheck"" and the lesser efforts as exemplified by ""Screamers"" and ""Impostor."" ""Next"" casts ""Ghost Rider"" star Nicolas Cage as glib but likable Las Vegas illusionist /mentalist Cris Johnson. Cris performs standard magic tricks on stage like pulling doves out of the least likely places and guessing what audience members will say before they utter it. Cris augments his meager income by capitalizing on his ability to see two minutes into the future to beat the odds at any of the casinos. Mind you, Cris exercises discretion so as not to arouse the suspicions of either casino authorities or the gaming commission. He wins consistent small sums of money on a regular basis without attracting attention. As ""Next"" unfolds, Cris runs out of luck when he discovers that casino security is going to bust him for thwarting a robbery. When he spots an armed man approach the cashier's cage, he sees into the future and realizes that the man is going to gun down a couple of casino guards. Cris catches the guy by surprise and disarms him. The sight of the guy's gun in Cris' hand triggers alarms everywhere. The authorities swarm the building, but Cris escapes because not only can he alter his appearance but also he is able to elude casino security in the maze of slot machines. Later, in the film, Cris explains to heroine Jessica Biel that he doesn't know how he acquired his clairvoyance.Meanwhile, Cris' uncanny ability to see what is going to occur before it does attracts the attention of tough, no-nonsense FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore of ""Hannibal"") who believes that Cris can help her to prevent a terrorist attack in Los Angeles. Basically, Ferris turns a blind eye to the Bill of Rights and behaves as if she were a cross-between of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry and Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs from the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. The FBI's chief problem is that they have no idea where the terrorists will detonate their stolen nuke. Nobody especially likes Ferris' harebrained idea but they have nothing else going for them so they follow her lead. Were this not enough plot, ""Next"" goes after the date movie crowd with a romantic subplot that has our hero wooing innocent twentysomething blond school teacher Liz (Jessica Biel of ""Stealth"") at a nearby Indian reservation. Their first encounter in a Las Vegas coffee shop is pretty funny stuff as Cris imagines the many ways that can introduce himself to Liz to win her sympathy.Initially, Cris refuses to help the FBI with his extrasensory gift despite their claims that the lives of 8 million people hang in the balance. Our hero suspects that he will be arrested, confined indefinitely against his will, and exploited by the Bureau for his extraordinary powers. Eventually, through sheer tenacity, Ferris catches up with Cris, braving a landslide at a cliff near a Grand Canyon motel that destroys the establishment. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the Feds, terrorists with Eastern European accents and brisk efficiency are monitoring the Bureau's every move. Predictably, the villains abduct the comely Ms. Biel and use her as a hostage in their bomb threat plan. Since Cris has fallen in love with Liz, he now has a reason to be patriotic.New Zealand director Lee Tamahori, who helmed the outlandish 007 epic ""Die Another Day"" and the superlative ""XXX 2: State of the Union,"" relies on super-charged, high-octane, action sequences to distract audiences from the formulaic, far-fetched plot. Cage is at his action hero best whether he is avoiding antique steam trains plunging down the side of a mountain or nimbly dodging the bullets of a sniper. ""Next"" allows Cage to be funny and heroic without one detracting from another. At the same time, Tamahori pares down what could have been a loquacious plot into a trim 96-minute actioneer with explosions galore. Unfortunately, ""Next"" unravels in its final quarter hour with a surprise turn of events that recall the abysmal 1989 thriller ""Millennium"" with Kris Kristofferson.",Next
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Light-years away from what it could have been, still gets the job done",7,12 July 2009,"Being a big fan of Philip K., and the fact that this flick being based on one of his stories being the primary reason I was interested in it, I made sure to read it before watching. It's one of his many excellent ones, and of course this doesn't get even remotely close to doing it justice. That much is obvious... similar to how Terminator: Salvation didn't deliver the terrifying and seemingly hopeless future world of war and darkness that we saw unforgettable glimpses of in '84. Anyone who didn't see that coming must be new to Hollywood. Instead, let's look at what this does do. It exists, you can choose to ignore it or judge it on its own terms, anything else will only lead to frustration. The concept is that Cris Johnson can see the future... not for particularly long, but enough for it to be useful, including for other people. He hides out with Columbo, until he is approached by Agent Starling who believes he can help prevent a nuke from being detonated. The fact that the plot(differing greatly from the original, to be expected, what he wrote wouldn't have made a mainstream blockbuster) is stretched(from about 33 pages in the book) in order to last the minimum for a feature film, 90 minutes, definitely shows. A tad of the time is spent on character development, which is nice and welcome(I wouldn't have minded more of it, and/or for what there was to be stronger), and the rest is the action sequences. They're pretty cool, and certainly entertaining. The effects range, and with several of them, you can tell that it's CGI. I didn't find the twists all that surprising, having seen the trailer, except maybe the last one. The pacing is fairly solid, and this kept my attention. Meanwhile, the ending really feels like they ran out of steam, and then went ahead and stopped it right there. The acting is good. Dialog varies. The cinematography and editing are fine. Tamahori is as he usually is, as a director, meaning entirely passable, and nothing extraordinary. The script isn't completely uncreative, and there are some nifty uses of the power of precognition. This doesn't feel all that toned down, although it could have gotten a higher rating for the terrorist plan. There is disturbing and intense content, relatively little actual violence, and very infrequent, moderate language. I recommend this to those looking for a popcorn movie built on the idea of premonition. 7/10",Next
17,view_and_review,As Bad As Nick Cage's Hair,2,29 March 2021,"In a world where love coupled with powers that allow you to see two minutes into the future, you're a superhero. Nicolas Cage is the superhero of this mediocre action thriller romance. His name is Chris Johnson and he can see into his own future by two minutes, except when it comes to Elizabeth (Jessica Biel). When she's involved, he can see into the distant future because... love. He was able to see her in his future far past the two-minute time limit and he used that knowledge to finagle a way into her life (and her pants).In this below average swill, the U. S. government needs to stop some European bad actors from detonating a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. The government as well as the bad guys are familiar with Chris Johnson's ability hence, they both want him, but for different reasons. How do they know of Chris? I don't know--considering he'd been doing a fair job hiding his ability from the world. Apparently, the FBI trawls the country for people exhibiting the slightest supernatural abilities as do foreigners.Julianne Moore plays the FBI super-agent on Johnson's tail. She's figured out Johnson's ability down to a T and she will do whatever she can to force him to help the United States. Why he has to be forced to stop a nuclear bomb instead of willingly helping? Because people are bad. As bad as Nicolas Cage's hair in this tripe. But he will help, and I'm sure you know why. Yes, you guessed it. Because of love. He and Liz have that special Hollywood love that only takes two days to blossom and culminates with their first kiss and sex all in the same night. That special love where after they've slept together, they instantly trust each other and would die for one another, because that's what sex means in a romance.Still, I think the most galling issue with ""Next"" is this whole two-minute thing. Is he perpetually seeing two minutes ahead or selectively seeing two minutes ahead? And if it's two minutes, how does he know precisely when to move to avoid a bullet? If someone told you that you'd be shot in two minutes, you wouldn't be able to dodge the bullet by moving at just the right time, your best bet at avoiding being shot is to be nowhere near the gunfire.""Next"" never attempted to be cinema worthy. They were doling out bad like it was Halloween candy: bad acting, bad script, bad plot, bad CGI, bad action sequences, bad romance, bad characters, etc. Then they did the dreaded and infamous dream sequence. This 90-minute carnival side show had an entire half-hour sequence that ended tragically. But guess what!! It was a dream. Johnson could still protect his newfound love and prevent doomsday. But alas he didn't. Doomsday came in the form of this movie and apparently no one had the foresight to stop it from being made.",Next

Dicks' ""The Golden Man"" with Cage as a two-bit Vegas magician who has the ability to see into his future by two minutes and the feds enlisting him to stop a nuclear strike. Witless, junky dialogue, cheesy special effects and hard-to-sustain plotting are the main faults of this laborious thriller.

However, unknown to anybody else, he also possesses the unique ability of being able to see approximately two minutes into the future. Then one day he becomes aware of a beautiful woman walking into a certain diner many days in advance and he immediately realizes that she will become an important part of his life. However, he doesn't specifically know what day she arrive. Neither does he realize that the two of them will become instrumental in a case involving the FBI and some terrorists who have in their possession a nuclear bomb which they plan on detonating in Los Angeles in the not-too-distant future. Now rather than reveal any more I thought this movie was pretty good for the most part with one particular scene involving Cris meeting ""Liz Cooper"" (Jessica Biel) being particularly humorous. Unfortunately, I must admit that I didn't care for the ending at all and this is the reason I have rated the film somewhat lower than I normally would. Slightly above average.",Next
21,ferguson-6,"Hey, Look Ahead",3,29 April 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. Just a preposterous story and film from all involved. Another film based on a Philip K. Dick novel, but this one trick pony just doesn't have the legs for the race.Acting whore Nicolas Cage sleep walks through another job for the paycheck. This time he plays Cris Johnson, psychic extrordinare, who moonlights as small time Vegas magician, Frank Cadillac. Naturally the FBI needs Cage to use his skills to track down a stolen nuclear war head before it blows up Los Angeles. The FBI agent in charge is Julianne Moore in her over-the-top tom boy/ tough gal mode. She is just so cool, we can't help but laugh! And if one ludicrous plot line wasn't enough, we must throw in a truly unbelievable love story with the beautiful Jessica Biel. Why did she take this role? It seems her part was thrown together while the film was being made. Basically Biel falls for Cage and the bad guys kidnap her and threaten to kill her so that Cage won't tell the FBI what the bad guys are planning. So logical. Evidently Peter Falk had nothing to do so they throw in one completely unnecessary and unexplained scene for the guy. Again ... Why?? The bright spot is that the head terrorist is played by Thomas Kretschmann, who you will remember as the ship captain in ""King Kong"". Mr. K makes for a ""good"" bad guy. OK, I guess one other bright spot ... a great Elvis song early on. The filmmakers saved their money with lousy special effects, a lousy script and ONE jacket for Cage.

Action film about future starring Nicolas Cage as magician Frank Cadillac who is wanted by FBI due to his ability to foresee the future by two minutes. Too bad that he didn't possess this ability before being cast in this film. Apparently there is a bomb set somewhere in the city and he is needed to assist in finding it. Script is smart with director Lee Tamahori having fun with Cage's options and humorous surprise ending. Tamahori previously made The Edge, which is far more suspenseful. Cage has fun with the role playing off Cadillac's need for solitude. Supporting roles are unfortunately flat relying totally on Cage to carry it. Jessica Biel is basically there to sleep with Cage then she is kidnapped and strapped to a chair with a bomb. Julianne Moore as an FBI agent is wasted. She has done far greater performances in much better films and this is definitely beneath her. Peter Falk appears briefly but serves little purpose. Jim Beaver plays a guy named Wisdom and that appears to be lacking in much of the film. The film is well made from a visual and production stand point, otherwise it is pointless entertainment. There is not much in terms of originality so it is not likely that we will be looking forward to what happens next. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Next

There's also a love interest pigeonholed into the tale in the form of Jessica Biel whom Chris can see way farther into the future when he's with. Also if you're looking for anything but an extremely loose adaptation of a PKD novel move on. As this has almost absolutely zilch to do with the book.For the most part this film was a fun,albeit absurdest, bit of escapism.

Julianne was a bit less believable, but one could tell that she did the best with what little the script gave her. Jessica, well let's simply say Miss Biel isn't in the biz on account of her acting ability and when he looks go so does her career and leave it at that. I was into the film, yea, but then IT happened. IT being the horrible ending that simply moots everything that came before. It's an ugly cop-out that soured the whole film for me and a reason i'd likely never watch the movie again.

25,gradyharp,A Good Idea from Philip K. Dick Slips Away in the Script,5,29 September 2007,"Philip K. Dick has been the resource of stories for some very exciting films (Minority Report, Total Recall, Blade Runner), but in NEXT, his short story 'The Golden Man' as adapted by Gary Goldman and directed by Lee Tamahori, the concept of precognition as a human feature in altering the future falls into a video game format that becomes more action film and less human interest tale.Cris Johnson AKA Frank Cadillac (Nicholas Cage) is a sloe eyed Las Vegas grungy magician who has found a way to hide the fact that he has the gift to see two minutes into his future, a gift that rewards him at the gambling tables but draws attention from the FBI after a thwarted attempt on Cris' part to stop a robbery is captured on video tape. The FBI, especially Agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore), knows that a nuclear device has entered the USA by terrorists headed by 'Mr. Smith' (Thomas Kretschmann), and that if the device cannot be traced, a nuclear bomb threatens the lives of millions of citizens. Agent Callie observes Cris' talent and engages him to aid in the discovery of the site of the device. But Chris' powers lead him to a beautiful young woman Liz (Jessica Biel) with whom his powers to see into the future can be extended for more than the requisite 2 minutes. After a series of 'attempts' at introduction, Cris and Liz bond, allowing Cris' expanded powers to be of more help to the persistent Agent Callie. From that point on the film dissolves into yet another combustible crashing action flick with endless CG special effects, all but erasing the character development. And the ending is as one might expect - not very Philip K. Dick in style.Cage and Biel do well, Moore seems bored with her character, and Kretschman yet again embodies the evil of terrorism and beyond. There are some rather extraneous scenes on an Indian reservation that add little except the beauty of the Grand Canyon to the story, and there are some truly funny scenes of themes and variations on the chances we take in approaching a potential love source. But in the end all gets rather lost in the explosions ad infinitum that mark the film as a routine action flick. Grady Harp",Next

27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Next,1,12 May 2007,"I was wondering the strange selection of Nicolas Cage movies to hit the big screens here. There was no love for his Weather Man or Lord of War, which seem on the surface to be probable successes, and I thought World Trade Center was a mediocre effort, no doubt hitting the big screens because of the subject matter, and helmed by Oliver Stone, who seem to be quite muted and didn't turn on the controversy tap. His latest, recent effort in Ghost Rider was fun, but unmemorable.Philip K. Dick's science fiction stories too have their fair share of hits and misses when translated to the silver screen. There's the cult classic Blade Runner by Ridley Scott, the box- office success of Total Recall by Paul Verhoeven, the new-age photo-realistic animation A Scanner Darkly by Richard Linklater, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report credited with Colin Farrell's noticeable appearance, and John Woo's Paycheck which made Uma Thurman look ugly without the use of prosthetics. Big stars too get attached to these pictures, from Harrison Ford to Tom Cruise to Arnold Schwarzenegger, each featured in diverse stories that the author has on offer, and most from short stories too. But what about the combination of Lee Tamahori and Nicolas Cage?Disaster. I've not read the short on which Next is based, but this movie failed Basic Storytelling 101. It sets up pre-determined rules, and goes ahead to break them all, while trying to be too smart about it, and they say pride comes before a fall - didn't any crew notice those huge warning signs? And it's not about the illogicality of time travel nor its associated paradoxes either. It's pure laziness in development, an obsessed focus in its mediocre action sequences, and without a clue in knowing how to end a story.Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson with Tom Hank's haircut from The Da Vinci Code. Johnson is a Las Vegas illusionist who's successful in his job because of his curse in being able to see things before they happen. Well, just anything two minutes ahead, and only if it directly involves himself. The only time that this rule doesn't seem to hold, is that he frequently daydreams about Liz (Jessica Biel), with whom he thinks he shares a mysterious connection with. The FBI is unto some terrorists who have placed a nuclear device in California, and one of its agents Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is after Johnson to seek his abilities to help them, while the baddies are after everyone else, in one of lamest reasons ever - since the FBI wants Johnson, let's waste time finishing him off.While there were tons of promise in the movie with a premise like that, you get frequently irritated when Tamahori playbacks scenes on repeat, pulling that sleight of hand that says, OK, that's what's happening in Johnson's mind, you'll following his 2-min peek into the future, and we go back again. But the 2 minutes seem to go onto 3, 4, 5 minutes, until the ultimate sleight of hand pulled and played too far back, it's plain ludicrous. It's fine and dandy for a while, until its self fulfilling prophecy. No doubt it tries to redeem itself by playing on a paradox - that things change when you look ahead (and alter a particular course of action), but as I've already mentioned, it's lazy.And the special effects were lazy too, with nothing done that an audience have never seen before, and to make things worse, some looked horribly fake. There's also an action routine going to make its staple this year (the other one noted was in the Die Hard 4.0 trailer), and that's the ""ducking from a mid-air flying car"" routine. The rest looked like the Matrix's ""bullet time / dodge while the bullets are flying at you / look mom I can split myself"" effects, which wears on after a while.Cage sleepwalks through the role, no doubt assisted by a world weary character, while Jessica Biel is totally wasted in a role that could have been played by any Playboy Playmate of the Year, and that's just to put her twin peaks forward on screen. Julianne Moore seemed to have reminisce her time playing FBI agent Clarice Starling from Hannibal, and you would have expect Hannibal Lecter himself to make an appearance and start eating everyone else - now that would make a better movie.Next has my vote as one of the worst movie of the year for pulling that kinda rug from underneath your feet.

Anyhoo, I rented the film Next the other day and watched it last night with my mom and it was pretty good until the ending. I mean, it was one of those typical ""let's leave you hanging"" type of films that I don't need more of in my life. Now while it was better than I expected, the special effects were cool and the story was decent, the cast also worked pretty well. But still the whole Jessica Biel and Nicholas Cage love story freaked me out, isn't he like 43 and Jessica's like 23? Isn't that just a smidge weird? Oh, well, that's Hollywood for you. Anyways, back to the film, Next over all was a decent film that is definitely worth a look, it's pure entertainment and flashy effects.Chris Johnson is a magician who can see the future two minutes in advance, of course certain people wanna take advantage of this. Like the FBI who needs his help to find a nuclear bomb in the middle of Los Angelas that could kill over 8 million people. But all Chris is worried about is finding a girl that he's been seeing in his mind, but he finally finds her at a diner, her name is Elizabeth, his possible future. But he may get her in trouble when the men who planted the bomb is after him and his new girl.Over all, Next is a good film, it's just very confusing in some moments, like Chris going back and forth from typical mentalist to guy who has a split mind. You'll see what I mean when you see the film. Julianne Moore was absolutely classic when she said so calmly to Nic Cage's character during the log rolling scene ""You're just going to let me die?"" I just loved that deliverance, it was so human like. In case you didn't note, that was saracasim. I'm sorry, I know this isn't a good comment, just had to get my complaints out.

30,blanbrn,A magic man who can see minutes into the future is the only hope to stop a terrorist bomb plot.,6,26 April 2009,"""Next"" isn't exactly a classic film still the film has enough intrigue, and interesting plot points of drama to make it a watch. Really the films genre could fall into the ranges of sci-fi, action-drama, or mystery-suspense. The cast of all star well known stars like Moore, Cage, and Biel move the film along very well also. Nick Cage is Chris Johnson a magician who works acts in Las Vegas, yet in reality Mr. Johnson has special powers he can see into the future I really mean it! I guess this is something that many people in real life would want that's the ability to see into the future. A federal agent Callie(veteran Julianne Moore) sees this ability first hand thru evidence she's obtained thru video footage. Then a plan has sprung to mind Callie wants to recruit Chris to help stop an apparent bomb plot by terrorists who are planning to blow up Los Angeles, CA. To add sugar and spice enter Jessica Biel who's well endowed and voluptuous as ever playing Liz a hot young and sexy female who Cage's character romances. The film moves along well with foreshadowing and flashback scenes combined with action packed scenes and special effects also. Ms. Biel even has a damsel in distress scene when she's kidnapped by the terrorists as she's tied up and has her mouth duct taped. Never fear in a superhero kind of way the magic man saves the day! Overall good film with a nice treat seeing Jessica Biel, and the action along with the different genre themes make ""Next"" a watch especially on a late night when nothing else is on cable or premium TV.",Next

In yet another in what is fast becoming a long string of unchallenging roles, Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson, a Vegas magician with the uncanny ability to see two minutes into his own future. So far, he's used this talent only as a part of his stage act and as a means of beating the house at gambling when he heads to the local casinos. But now he's being asked by the FBI to employ his unique skill in helping to thwart a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in downtown Los Angeles. Cris, however, wants nothing whatsoever to do with saving the world (for reasons that are never made entirely convincing for the audience), so he's off and running through the greater Southwest with both the feds and the bad guys in hot pursuit.""Next"" might have been an interesting movie had the writers found a way to really make the time-bending premise believable and compelling instead of just using it as an excuse to get everybody zipping around in fast-moving cars. In addition, under Lee Tamahori's directorial aegis and with a screenplay concocted by no fewer than three (!) paid writers, we're treated to cardboard villains with sinister accents, chintzy production values and special effects, incoherently executed gun battle scenes, plot holes one can drive a mack truck through, and a plethora of predictable man-on-the-run, action movie clichés. Even on a plot level, this gimmicky movie rarely plays fair with its audience, having Cris perform amazing feats that have little or nothing to do with his ability to read the future. Then, in a final act of disrespect, the filmmakers tack on one of those ridiculous we-were-just-kidding-folks endings that is enough to turn a person off movies forever.In addition to Cage, the movie wastes the considerable talents of Julianne Moore, in yet another of her hysterical, over-the-top law enforcer roles (when is she planning on appearing in a good movie again?), and Jessica Biel, who is at least appealing as the unsuspecting girl Cris drags along on his utterly pointless tri-state spree.""Next"" proves that, even for Nicholas Cage - who has hitherto done pretty well for himself with movies set in Sin City (""Leaving Las Vegas,"" ""Honeymoon in Vegas"") - Lady Luck won't always be smiling.",Next
33,bensonmum2,"""It happened. It just hasn't happened yet.""",2,14 April 2008,"What a load! Next has to be one of the most contrived pieces of garbage to come down the pike in quite a while. To begin, the plot is utterly ridiculous. Nicholas Cage is Chris Johnson, a man who has the ability to see two minutes into the future. For some reason known only to her, FBI Agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is looking for Johnson to help her stop a terrorist attack. For some reason known only to them, the terrorists are also looking for Johnson. For obvious reasons, Johnson is looking for Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel). And for no fathomable reason, Liz falls for Johnson. Oh yeah, and there's a nuclear weapon about to explode.I'm determined that I'm not going to waste a lot of time writing about Next. It would be easy to get sucked in and go through the laundry list of things that infuriated me while watching the movie. Things like why in the world is the FBI wasting so much money and time on find a two-bit Vegas showman with a little psychic ability? If they spent that much on locating the terrorists, they would have never gotten into the country. Another topic I could beat like a dead horse is why in the world would Jessica Biel's character give Cage a second look? From the creepy hair and smile to his even creepier stalker-like obsession, she'd be getting a restraining order if Next were based in reality. Instead, I'll focus this on Next's gimmick. Using his psychic ability and seeing what's about to happen to him, Johnson is able to change the future. We, the audience, get to see the future Johnson sees and then see what he does to make it different. For example, we see two people get shot right in front of Johnson. But that wasn't reality  that was Johnson looking into the future. We then see the same scene play out only this time Johnson does something to stop the killer. Next, Johnson's car is hit by a train. Wait a minute  that was just Johnson's vision of the future. He's able to speed up and beat the train. The first time it happens it's actually pretty cool. But when it happens over and over, it gets old very fast. And by the time we discover that the entire second half of the movie is just one of Johnson's visions of the future, it gets insulting.

35,Robert_duder,Hugely under rated action film. This was a terrific surprise and a unique spin on a tired genre,9,3 September 2007,"I think it takes a lot to make an original action movie nowadays. It's not always hard to make a good one but to put forth an interesting and unique story and actually get people interested in the characters and the story and not just all the explosions and gun fights and everything else is a difficult task. I admit I had seen a trailer or two for Next when it released and I didn't think it really looked like it would be too great. I mean I'm not a huge Nicholas Cage fan although he has done some terrific movies, there is something about him that usually really irks me. So imagine my surprise when Next really blew apart my expectations and turned out a really terrific film with great action scenes and an entirely new spin on the action genre. I mean the idea of reading minds or seeing the future is not a new concept by any means but to incorporate that into an action film makes the hero almost invincible and that's exactly what they did and it's really fun to watch. Instead of making the hero the focus of what could happen to him they make this nuclear threat the focus and what could happen with it while unfolding a romance between the hero and his destiny.Nicholas Cage is Cris Johnson, a Las Vegas magician with more to his act than people think. Johnson can see HIS future. No one else's, just his own and only 2 minutes ahead. This mean he can see various different outcomes of his reactions and movements, he can avoid every punch during a fight, every bullet coming at him, and it means a lot of flash forwards in the film but somehow the film makers don't make it tedious or annoying. Cage is good in the role and he always manages to make an action film riveting even though ultimately he is always Nicholas Cage and doesn't really have a wide spectrum of acting ability in my opinion. He is still good at what he does. Julianne Moore is another actress I've never been a huge fan of. I usually find her a little monotonous and almost boring but she actually really caught my eye as tough as nails FBI Agent Callie Ferris. I really liked watching her and Cage team up and they have terrific chemistry. She was also a really strong female character and did a great job of balancing out Cage's macho character. Then we have Miss Jessica Biel, a current Hollywood It girl and I have to say that I don't know why. I will go on record as saying Biel has very little talent in front of the camera and Next is really no exception. Her and Cage have very little chemistry considering she is Cage's destiny and the love of his life. I find her performances over done and forced and she just doesn't bring a lot to the table and she doesn't hold her own against Cage or Moore in the acting arena. A much better actress could have really added to the role.I think this is the type of action film I could watch again and again and should perhaps be an action classic because there was just a lot of great scenes including Cage's fight...or lack thereof with Biel's ex-boyfriend, Cage's clever escape from the casino, and his dodging bullets when he is shot at. The entire premise of the film is just damn cool to put it bluntly. I wish the film had done better because I would have loved to have seen a sequel and in fact I think the premise of the film would make a terrific Television Series and I think a really talented TV actor could pick up from Cage's performance. All in all the film is one of the better action movies I have seen and a great plot. Director Lee Tamahori has a knack for making really great films that don't necessarily get the respect or attention they deserve including The Edge with Anthony Hopkins, and Along Came A Spider with Morgan Freeman and now this. I think he has something really big coming for him in the future because his films are terrific including this one. 9/10",Next
36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Leaves you wondering what wrong move Cage will make Next,4,22 December 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Chris Johnsson (Nicolas Cage) is a Las Vegas magician who simply gets by doing what he does, nothing more. But all his life Chris has been hiding a secret: he can see two minutes into the future and prevent bad things from happening. But this secret starts to be exposed when he stops two hit men from taking out a target in a casino. No nonsense FBI captain Callis Ferris (Julianne Moore) notices this and puts two and two together in relation to his gift. She decides Chris is needed to stop some terrorists from detonating a chemical weapon on American soil and rounds up a team of crack soldiers to go after him. But Chris isn't going to be pushed around and, with new love Liz (Jessica Biel) in tow, goes on the run. But what will he decide in the end? Nic Cage seems to be on some mission to wreck his career at the moment. He did appear in the excellent Lord of War and World Trade Centre, but followed this up with the disastrous American re-make of British horror classic The Wicker Man. It probably didn't help after that making a film with almost exactly the same title called The Weather Man, followed up by the poorly received Ghost Rider and now this preposterous little film.Director Lee Tamahori has some good credits to his name, notably decent wilderness thriller The Edge, but with a script this absurd and far fetched it's a different story altogether. It goes through the motions right to the end, rounded off with, as bob the moo has already well described it, a pathetically weak conclusion, a total cop out that seemed the only way to round off what had already been up to that point absolute nonsense right from the start.Cast wise, Cage does his usual dourly spoken thing. He looks odd in this film, with a funny looking brow and hair style. In support, Moore makes her role no more memorable than your average ball busting lady in charge, while Biel is little more than eye candy. But the worst offenders are the villains, who have no meat on their bones at all. The script doesn't develop them in any way, and you don't even come away remembering a lead villain. Worse than that, they're all the usual stereotypes, with Russian, Plummy English and, for the hatrick, German accents flying around like bullets during the finale.Cage seems to be losing respect like minutes of his life at the moment. Maybe time to get a better agent? **",Next
37,MLDinTN,"Bad hair, mediocre plot",5,8 April 2008,"This movie was just so-so. The most memorable part of the film is Nick Cage's horrible fake looking hair. Is he using spray on paint to cover up those bald spots? But forget the bad hair, and focus on the story. The plot was OK, but nothing great.Cage plays Chris Johnson a clairvoyant who can see 2 minutes in the future. He has a magic act in vegas and uses his power to make some money in the casinos, but he doesn't want to win enough to be noticed. But too late. Some FBI agents, led by Julianne Moore, are on to his future seeing and want his help to track a nuclear bomb. Chris on the other hand is interested in meeting his dream girl Liz, played by Jessica Biel. Liz and him go on a car trip while the agents are after him. And somehow the terrorists know about him too. I didn't get that part. Liz gets kidnapped and Chris agrees to cooperate with the agents.At least this movie wasn't filled with a ton of plot holes. It did make sense. But Biel and Cage are bad together. He's nearly old enough to be her dad. They didn't make a cute couple.FINAL VERDICT: OK story, but Biel and Cage do not make a great couple. Not worth paying to see.",Next

40,inkblot11,"Next to brilliant, except for Cage's hair; a very wonderful film",9,11 June 2007,"Chris (Nicolas Cage) is a magician in Las Vegas. He puts on a good show and hits the gaming tables after his performances. More often than not, he wins. But, it is not just dumb luck. Chris can see into the future, glimpsing two minutes ahead of time what will happen to him. Of course, he wins only modest amounts of money in his gambling ventures, not really wanted to call attention to himself. Too bad. The casino owners are suspicious and a hotshot FBI agent (Julianne Moore) is also breathing down his neck. This is because she wants Chris to help locate a big bomb that is about to go off in the Los Angeles area. Chris is one step ahead of everyone, however, and eludes their clutches. His own hope is to meet the girl of his dreams, the one he sees in his future. Crossing paths at a diner in Vegas, Elizabeth (Jessica Biel) is beautiful and loving and the two of them head to Arizona. Hoping to avoid the authorities, they hold up in a remote motel. But, the FBI is desperate for Chris's help and the bad guys with the bomb are on his trail, too. Will Chris cooperate with the FBI or will he continue to run away? This is a wonderful film, based on still another tale from that brilliant author, Phillip K. Dick. The man who wrote the stories that inspired Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, and Paycheck may be Hollywood's dream writer, long after his death. As in the previous films, the plot is ingenious and tantalizing, for to have the gift of prophecy is both a curse and a blessing. Cage is terrific as Chris, showing us a character filled with angst and confusion over his ability as a seer, yet remaining a loving and good person. But, his hair! Let's all tar and feather the stylist who decided to give him the baddest of bad hair days. Yet, nothing can diminish his magnetism, ever. Moore is also great as the tough-as-nails FBI agent, playing essentially the same character that she did in Children of Men. Then, too, Biel is lovely as the woman who falls for the man everyone is chasing, putting her own life in considerable jeopardy. The costumes, desert settings, and production values are very high. Also, the special effects are nice, as Chris escapes danger time and again by anticipating the moment he must jump in a different direction. What fun, indeed. Even so, the overall message of the film is a serious one, showing the viewer that to know the future may sometimes be welcome and sometimes intolerable. Make certain you watch the end credits, as they are surprisingly different from most other films. In short, next time you are hungry for a great movie, get Next. It is a terrific film to watch and will make for equally terrific conversation after any showing.",Next
41,atlasmb,Mining Another Philip K. Dick Story,7,23 May 2014,"""Next"" comes from a story written by Philip K. Dick, like many clever film titles in the last thirty years. Once again, he takes a simple idea--an alternate reality, if you will--and creates with it an engaging drama.The film involves a variation on time travel. More correctly, it involves multiple realities/universes. Nicholas Cage plays Chris Johnson aka Frank Cadillac, a small-time Las Vegas magician who makes his real money at the gaming tables. He has a special talent: he can look two minutes into his future to see the outcomes of his various potential actions.This talent has put him in the cross hairs of the FBI and others. The feds (especially the team lead by a special agent played by Julianne Moore) want him to help them thwart the nefarious plans of terrorists. But Chris has suffered enough prodding at the hands of the authorities during his life.The narrative has fun with the idea of multiple realities, often fooling the viewer. Amidst the chase scenes are numerous chances to question the boundaries of the magician's ""powers"". The special effects used to portray his options are enjoyable.The wild card is an attractive young woman named Liz Cooper (Jessica Biels) who enters his consciousness. Chris is drawn to this mysterious woman, especially since her presence seems to alter his abilities.I can't say Nicholas Cage would be my first choice for this role, but he plays it well enough. Jessica Biels is fun to watch and believable. Julianne Moore does a good job of riding the line between hard-nosed agent and considerate person.I feel sure some people will not like the ending. And those who prefer to detect plot holes rather than enjoy the ride may not find much enjoyment at all.",Next
42,The-Sarkologist,Knowing Your Future,7,22 July 2021,"It's always good when I discover that a film that is based on a Phillip K Dick novel, but in reality I would use the word based in a very, very, very loose term. The reason I say that is because the only similarities between the story and the film is the name of the main character. Well, okay, the main character can also see a short distance into the future as well, but I got the feeling that the powers in the Dick story are somewhat stronger than the powers that Cris displays in the film.Anyway, Cris has this power that allows him to see two minutes into the future, but only where he is concerned, so he makes a living hustling in Las Vegas, both as a stage magician and as a gambler. Mind you, considering that they picked him up pretty quickly, it does make me wonder how he managed to last as long in Vegas as he has because I'm sure he would have pretty much been kicked out of all of the Casinos pretty quickly.So, some Russians have stolen a nuclear warhead and intend to detonate it in Los Angeles, and the FBI want to get hold of Cris so that they can use his powers to locate the bomb. The problem is that Cris is a pretty slippery character because he pretty much disappears before they even rock up, namely because he can see into the future, and thus bases his moves upon what he knows.However, there is one exception to this power, and that is that he is able to see further into the future where a girl is concerned, and not surprisingly he ends up picking her up at a bar, using his powers of course to predict the best way to approach her. So, the film falls into partly a romance (and Cage really doesn't seem to work all that well when it comes to romances), and also an action/sci-fi where Cage is either helping the FBI and also running away from them.An interesting trick that they use in the film is that you don't always know whether you are witnessing a premonition or not, so the film certainly does fool you quite often in that regards. That is probably the one thing that I thought that they did really well. In fact, it is a way that they manage to create a lot of twists and turns, namely because you are heading down one direction, only to discover that it was just a premonition - and they never actually tell you which is which.As I mentioned, Cage doesn't seem to really work all that well when it comes to romantic endeavours. He just seems to be a bit too much of a rough nut, though he is able to show quite a gentile side as well. Okay, he certainly does seem to have quite a breadth when it comes to his acting ability, but in this film it just felt a little flat. However, once we hit the second half of the film, it really did start picking up, especially when the action ramped up, which in the end made me feel that it actually wasn't a bad film after all, and I'd probably consider it to be one of this little gems that you probably haven't heard about.",Next
43,Floated2,Decent but could have been better,7,7 July 2012,"Nicolas Cage stars as Cris Johnson – a cheesy Vegas performer with the power to see a few minutes into the future, as long as the action involves or affects his life in some way. FBI Agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is aware Cris has some sort of power to see the future, so she has been tracking him and wants to convince the guy to help stop a possible terrorist attack. Because of his past, Cris is wary of trusting government agents, so he attempts to escape by hitching a ride with a pretty lady who has caught his eye, Liz (Jessica Biel). Now, he is on the run, and the French terrorists have joined in tracking Cris to make sure he doesn't disrupt their diabolical plan (yep, French terrorists, or, at least, they sound French. Maybe they are Russian and I just don't get it. More on this later).Next has plenty of problems, but plenty of entertainment as well. Director Lee Tamahori does a good job grabbing the audience's attention as we watch possible future scenarios play out in Cris's head, then get brought back to current time to see what our hero will do to avoid danger or get what he wants. Of course, this also gives the audience plenty of laughs, and Cage has some of his best moments when using the information, both of which are welcome in this movie. Sadly, Tamahori gives up the mechanism too early in the movie, and should have kept it going throughout. However, while we get a decent action film, Tamahori is not too focused on details, and should have pushed his actors into better performances.",Next
44,johnnyboyz,"Some will indeed be crying out ""Next!"" during the film but on the whole, it just falls short of being good enough entertainment.",5,5 April 2008,"'Next' is one of those films that stands right on the cusp between entertainment and out and out farce. From an entertainment point of view, Next does its job and does its job rather well but subjectively the film is an absolute mess and I've only rated it as high as I have because of the enjoyment factor the film carries. You can call Next a piece of entertainment that requires little to no thought and does resemble the sort of film you could be forgiven for if you were to turn off your brain. But Next's unique selling point is an idea that requires attention; an idea that requires an active mind and that contradicts the film's aesthetic: is it trying to be entertainment or is it trying to be artistic and smart? Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson, a man with a gift and it is this gift that is behind the film's original idea and title because he can see into the 'next' two minutes of his life. The idea is decent and rather original, good enough to be in a successful sci-fi novel before this film but on this evidence, the material has not been translated too successfully. The trouble is, Cris could easily use his power to be a really successful American Football player or boxer; seeing the opposition's plays or punches before they happen thus giving him the ability to work around it. He has these skills and puts them to use when he wins a fist-fight and manages to dodge bullets, but we first encounter him as a magician, a magician who has somehow simultaneously obtained the interest of both the F.B.I. and some nasty Euro-trash terrorists in the same day.The reason I say Next is not sure weather it actually wanted to be as bad as it was is down to both its fantastic idea that someone can see immediately into their future before it happens and its attitude to women. Jessica Biel plays Liz Cooper, the girl that Cris was 'destined' to meet, but she does not play loose and easy to get upon the first meeting. Indeed, when Cris struts over and wins a fight with an abusive ex-partner; the Hollywood ideation is that Cris has 'saved her' and won the fight over the bad guy, thus winning her affection. But here, Cris has to loose the fight in order to gain her affection which goes against grain.So we have Cris and Liz on the road to a certain somewhere but what else is going on? Well, the antagonists of the film are a reason the film cannot be classified as anything too special. Thomas Kretschmann, who is German; plays a terrorist named 'Mr. Smith' who is in cahoots with some other terrorists (who're French) and is bent on killing Cris for himself. Throw in some mention of Russians at the very beginning and have an Englishman boss Smith about, and you have a Euro-trash cocktail of badguys  terrible. They have a nuclear bomb somewhere in L.A. and will detonate it; they suspect something is 'up' when the F.B.I go after Cris, so they try to eliminate him. But the F.B.I want Cris so that he can 'see' the blast happen before it does and thus, tell them where it occurs. But Cris can only see two minutes into the future so they'd have a two minute response time.And then the film decides to get really quite silly. Julianne Moore is agent Clarice Starl....no wait, she's Callie Ferris; the leader of the investigation, but there is something oddly humorous about seeing Moore dressed as an F.B.I. agent, wielding a gun and tracking terrorists during a docklands shootout; all the time being accompanied by tough looking male SWAT team members. The silliness has reached a peak by this point; the earlier dismissal of weak female Hollywood ideas becomes apparent when Liz falls for Cris over a couple of silly magic tricks and there is a huge plot hole which acts as an excuse for further trust/romance when Cris 'fails' to 'see' Liz put the pill in the drink in the future. She must act on impulse, merely to stretch the relationship for the film's sake.Next is a film that works when it isn't being so dumb, but it is only to a very basic degree of entertainment. The film is extremely analeptic in its approach to its narrative, meaning it'll show future events on a regular basis as part of its delivery as a piece of entertainment. But make no mistake, this is no manipulation of time and space Tarantino would be seen near; nor is as clever as other films that do this trick. Next is a sort of Groundhog Day for the 21st, post-modern century where you do not have to wait an entire day to correct your mistake of the 'past', only a mere few minutes. The film's idea is similar to a computer game: save your progress, continue and if you die; re-load with the added knowledge that a certain method will result in failure. To compare Next's premise with a computer game should be enough to deter some people but might encourage others. It's a difficult film to recommend given it's all so silly and incidental and the twist can be seen coming; but on the entertainment scale the film does enough to withhold interest, even if it is just to see if these two people end up happy.",Next

46,Anonymous_Maxine,Average Cage thriller.,5,14 October 2008,"Next is not so much about seeing the future as it is about the paradoxes involved with seeing it. There are so many paradoxes involved in time travel and looking ahead in time that it is amazing that a movie hasn't come along earlier that deals exclusively with them. Unfortunately, the movie has not been as successful as it should have been (really, do you know even a single person who's not interested in the idea of time travel or looking into the future?), but that's probably mostly because people either love Nicholas Cage or hate him. He's a fine actor, but not exactly box office gold.Cage plays Cris Johnson, a.k.a. Frank Cadillac, a small time Las Vegas magic show performer who pads his shows with his real life ability to see 2 minutes into the future. One night he is cashing out in a casino (he also pads his income with this ability in the gambling rooms, being careful to keep his winnings small enough to remain unnoticed) and ""sees"" that the guy in front of him is about to rob the place and kill two people, so he calls attention to his secret ability by stopping the robbery and then accidentally explaining to the authorities that the guy was about to kill two people.Julianne Moore heads up the FBI's attempt to recruit Johnson's services to help stop the Russians from detonating a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. The Russians detonating a nuclear bomb in LA? In 2007? If that sounds like a cookie-cutter action/thriller plot, it's because it is. There is a hazy explanation given for why Johnson can see a few minutes into the future, but it's not really important. More importantly, his lack of interest in helping stop the impending catastrophe comes from a deep aversion to attention that he developed as a child due to massive government and medical testing.The stifling love story is introduced in the form of Jessica Biel, who plays the part of an arrogant hottie who casually slaps down Johnson's polite greetings in a local café. Intrigued, as we are, that for some reason he can see further into her future than anyone else's, he is determined to meet her, so he looks into his own future to try out a few different ways to introduce himself to her, until he finds one that works. Soon her jerk boyfriend walks in and gives him a golden opportunity for some heavily scripted heroism.We never learn why he can see further into her future than anywhere else, and it becomes clear that this is purely a plot device used to put the two together. Not exactly a good sign, given how badly messed up their romance is. There's a scene in a hotel room where he woos her with some sweet words and then blows it completely with a stupid magic trick. Nice work, moron! The movie ends with a special-effects laden action sequence which is both highly contrived and unimpressively, ah, animated. Like so much of the rest of the film, Johnson finds himself in situations that allow him to perform astonishing feats, even for a man who can see two minutes into the future. Given that everything is so convenient for him for the whole movie, there's never any real tension and never any sense that he has really accomplished much. Nicholas Cage has done worse than this, but he's also done a lot better",Next

It is what my good friend DragonChylde calls a ""niche film,"" and that analogy fits as good as any. What that means is that there is a small corner of the audience-mill who will love and appreciate it for what it is. Only those in a ""niche"" audience will ""get"" this film.If you are into science fiction, political thrillers, pseudo-sciences, or paranormal studies, then you will more than likely highly enjoy this work. Otherwise, the plot twists, the time shifts, and the story itself may be a bit too much for you to take in all at once. On average, it takes the casual viewer two viewings to understand the plot, so if you did not ""get"" this movie, give it a second viewing. You may come out a fan of this work.Cage portrays a man who can see two minutes into the future except where one strange woman is concerned. Two minutes may not seem like a long time, but if you've ever instantly regretted a decision, two minutes is more than ample time to have taken it back, acted differently, or saved the situation.I've been working with temporal theory for years, so of course I was highly interested in this work. I find the descriptions used herein, the portrayals, and demonstrations of how things work, to be en par with many of the higher theories I work with.Cage's performance is exemplary (as usual), and while I have never considered Jessica Biel a serious actress, I may, if she continues contributing performances such as the one exhibited herein. I am withholding my judgment until I see where she goes after this.All in all, if you are a fan of the genres/areas listed at the beginning of this review, you will most likely find this work highly intriguing and vastly entertaining.

He's hunted down by FBI agents who tries to use his ability by force which really is a torture with an excuse. There are thugs after him also, but there's no difference in the behavior between the FBI agents and the thugs. He was treated like America's most wanted, and a lab rat for no good reason.

Along the way it mixes in a roomful of to-the-letter FBI stereotypes, a painfully shoehorned love story and a weirdly under-explained cell of nuke wielding French terrorists. Even the mindless action scenes are toothless, as Nic Cage's future-weary prophet sees every bullet coming before the gun's even drawn, basically playing the part of Neo without the presence of an Agent Smith to counter his moves. Nic Cage is his usual anti-charismatic self, old and burnt-out at a glance, but the real surprise isn't how low Cage sinks - it's how far Julianne Moore is willing to follow.

This is mind boggling when you think about it, and I'm not sure how it makes sense, but if you wanna describe Next in one philosophical sentence, this quote would be a good one.This motion picture has a very nifty idea, for which credit should probably go to Short story writer Phillip K. Dick for thinking about it, but equal credit should go to Lee Tamahori for making it work on screen. Of course, a nifty idea, is not always an intelligent one. Next is quite silly and unbelievable, but perhaps that is part of what makes it fun. The film is on a strange borderline between action thriller and realist fantasy. The finished product works well enough, and provides ninety plus minutes of reasonably solid entertainment.Vegas magician Cris Johnson bases his act on his ability to see two minutes into the future. This is something that has not gone unnoticed by Federal agent Callie Ferris and her team, who are trying to track him down in the hopes that he can use his ability help them stop a terrorist a terrorist attack in Los Angeles. meanwhile, Cris is looking for someone himself. There is a girl somewhere in town, and every time she enters his mind, he can see more than two minutes into the future. Time is ticking for everyone, and the future is uncertain....or is it.What is a little aggravating about the plot is the way that we get the impression that without Cris, the feds are useless at stopping the forces of evil. That thought is a little scary, imagine national security being so incompetent. Good thing that these things don't happen in real life.Nicholas Cage is famed for his over acting, which can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. Here he is toned down a bit, which is good, but it could just be the result of laziness (but who cares). Julianne Moore even at fifty is still a pretty face who kicks ass well here. Jessica Biel is also pretty face, but that's about it, she doesn't have much of a role.I suppose there is room for improvement, but I am not gonna complain. The film is satisfactory in the end, and if you are not a tough critic, I think I can recommend it.",Next

What the critics say and people say about the film, I do not care. They can bash all they want.I know, in my opinion, that I liked this movie a lot. Seeing that this is based on a short story written by the same guy who wrote ""Minority Report,"" ""Paycheck,"" and several others, I'm not surprised to say that this film doesn't disappoint. I love time movies, as you all know. This isn't any lass clever or more clever than any other time movie.There is enough originality, suspense, and action scenes here for me to pay attention to the film. It's a popcorn movie. Judging from the plot, some people may feel the movie is a cop out. When you think this is the end, it goes back from the beginning and so on. Sounds like a cop out? I don't know. It's up to you.If you don't like the sound of the premise, don't watch it. There will be so many cop outs in here, you wouldn't want to know what to believe. But I liked it. I don't feel like they're cop outs. They're merely a look to the future so you would know what to do in the present.Like any popcorn films, or most of them, the action scenes are really great, not to mention clever. The first fifteen minutes is one of the best introduction scenes I've ever seen. The visual effects may not be great (and some as cheesy), but it's good enough.

FBI Agent Ferris (Julianne Moore) is trying to forcefully enlist him in an FBI case involving international espionage case and nukes. Annoying how she unequivocally believes in his foresight power, which he has parlayed into a Las Vegas magician act to stay undercover in plain sight.NEXT is from a Phillip K.

There are so many dangling threads in NEXT that we're soon entangled like a playful kitty in a ball of yarn.When Cris stops a potential thief in a casino, the police think he was the thief and chase him; he then ""sees"" his way through a complex cat-and-mouse evasion of the police through the casino labyrinth - yet he couldn't ""see"" how to avoid the police mistaking him for the thief in the first place?

The execution done by Lee Tamahori is decent, but could have been done a lot better. The CGI effects look average but placed in the context are just right. Nick's ability seems limited at first. Later we will find out that he was holding back. A lot of things are not explained. More background on Nick's character would have been nice. Who is Peter Falk supposed to be? What is so special about Jessica Biel that Nicks' character wants to meet her? Has he already seen that they would end up in bed? And how did the FBI know of the existence of the nuclear bomb?

He can see two minutes into the future. Our federal government wants Cage to help locate a stolen nuclear weapon while he prefers to stay under the radar, and so a not-so-merry chase ensues. By the way, the bad guys (all white Europeans, no Arabs) also want Cage for reasons that are never made completely clear. Julianne Moore costars as the fed in charge of tracking Cage down, and she is no better or worse than she was in THE FORGOTTEN, a forgettable sci-fi fantasy from a couple of years ago. Jessica Biel provides the eye-candy as Cage's latest girlfriend.

There are some apocalyptic scenarios but everything is too unreal and too goofy as well. Jessica Biel is really impressive but only for her beauty.

There's definitely an intriguing movie promised with the setup of Next and there are very brief glimpses of a good movie trying to get out. The movie unfortunately does not take full advantage of its rich source material and instead is more content focusing on standard action beats and a love story that just doesn't carry as much weight as the film wants to believe it does. Jessica Biel plays Elizabeth(the girl from Cris's premonition) and she has no screen presence nor do she and cage have chemistry. But what's worse than the hackneyed love story is its handling of the authoritarian themes of Dick's source novel. In the movie the authorities hunting Cris are seen as justified for fabricating charges and destroying video evidence for the sake of finding ways to capture Cris and use him as a tool in the war on terror, the movie's argument is so weak on this point that the movie manufactures the element of European terrorists elements(of British, French, and German nationality) whose ideology, beliefs and motivations are never explored or discussed and instead used as a plot device. This was apparently the result of a massive rewrite that happened at Saturn Films and needless to say it's an element that is not only insulting to the source material, but also the audience for trying to convince us its paper thin argument for the need to circumvent individual liberties for ""the greater good"".

74,sarastro7,Don't get it? Listen here...,8,28 April 2007,"Most people (incl. professional reviewers) don't seem to ""get"" this movie. Well, it's your lucky day! Sarastro7 is here to explain it to you! :-)You have to look at it in both literal and non-literal terms. Like many other seemingly straight-forward movies (Children of Men, for instance), this one is partly an art movie.The nuclear threat represents the world situation. The main character, though he doesn't know it at first, is a hero who will save the world. But he doesn't understand the value of helping the world (as opposed to just himself) until he encounters a certain concept, which also acts as his conscience: beauty. Represented, of course (and quite well, I dare say), by Jessica Biel's character. Let's say, for simplicity's sake, that he represents reason and she represents emotion. When the two join together, they become more than the sum of their parts, and their combined abilities increase a thousandfold. It's an artistic commentary on what the human mind might be capable of.Most people don't realize it, but many Hollywood movies are actually written with great sensitivity to the question of human nature and the actual world situation, its problems and possible solutions. But it's often kept in an allegorical style that many people never notice. The truth is that at least some of the movies have a good deal more substance than they appear to have.Next is a fine movie. Anything that was wrong with it occurred in the last part where Biel's character was held hostage, and this whole part was just Cage's character working out how *not* to go about solving the problem. So whatever plot holes the movie had, it erased by the end. Ultimately, there were no plot holes.Yes, it ended abruptly, and surprisingly. When Cage and Biel were back in bed, I thought, cool, now we'll see what really happens. But no. Because there was no longer any point. He'd worked out how to achieve the happy ending, and so it simply wasn't necessary to go through the motions of showing it, since it was entirely preordained. Good point. And I agree - even if I wished we had seen some more of it. I enjoyed the movie and wanted it to go on, but I understand the rationale for ending it at that point, and I concede that it was the right thing to do.Very attractive movie. I'll definitely get the DVD.8 out of 10.(One thing I don't understand, however, is whatever possessed them to call this movie ""Next"". It doesn't make any particular sense to the story, and it is certainly one of the least charismatic and least commercial titles they could possibly have chosen. OTOH, I don't know what else they should have called it...)",Next
75,hall895,Not smart enough to succeed,5,20 September 2013,"Next is a movie with a very interesting concept. But that concept requires a very smart script to make it work. And unfortunately the script here proved nowhere smart enough to enable the movie to really succeed. The movie backs itself into corners it has no way out of and then just blatantly cheats to get out of them. The first half of the movie shows good promise as the story sets itself up. But that setup is never properly paid off. The drama doesn't build, instead it fizzles out. Things start to get rather dull. Then things get really convoluted and the writers can't untangle the mess they've made. It all leads up to an ending which falls completely flat and kind of insults the viewer to boot. If you run the movie back through your mind you realize it doesn't add up, doesn't make sense.The story follows small-time Las Vegas magician Cris Johnson who has the unique ability to be able to see two minutes into his own future. He tells nobody about his powers but FBI agent Callie Ferris somehow figures it out and recruits him to help prevent terrorists setting off a nuclear bomb. Well, she tries to recruit him anyway. Cris, with his unique vision, sees her coming and is gone before Callie can find him. Meanwhile there's this other woman whom Cris keeps having visions of. In the visions she's walking into a diner so Cris goes to the diner every day waiting for her. She never shows up. Until conveniently she does show up on the very day that the FBI is looking for Cris. He and the woman, Liz, take off for Flagstaff, Arizona. The FBI chases after them. So, for no apparent reason, do the terrorists. They have the bomb. Couldn't they, you know, just set it off instead of chasing after some weird magician they really don't know anything about and a random woman he happens to be traveling with? Anyhow, Cris and Liz end up stuck in a hotel, the FBI and the terrorists hot on their tails. And here the movie starts to veer off track.Nicolas Cage turns in a reasonably decent performance as the reluctant would-be hero Cris. But the material ultimately fails him. The movie needed to be really intelligent to work and it is not. Cris knows he can't really avert this nuclear catastrophe. He knows the limits of his power, only being able to see two minutes into his own future, but the FBI does not. Conveniently he can see further than two minutes into the future when this random woman Liz is involved. Would be interesting if the movie ever explains that but it never does. It's just something that has to be true for the movie to work. But it still doesn't end up working. There are too many things here which just don't make sense. The movie establishes its rules and then breaks them whenever the writers can't figure out a way forward. Cage does the best he can. Jessica Biel is pretty good too as the mysterious Liz. But the story lets them down as do some of their fellow performers. Julianne Moore seems very bored as she plays FBI agent Ferris. It's pretty clear the way she mails her performance in that Moore resents being in what she believes to be a bad movie. There's nothing at all memorable about the terrorists, they're a largely faceless, nameless, worthless bunch. Cris has some personality and intrigue to him, Liz is a decent character but everyone else disappoints. And ultimately the movie itself disappoints too. An intriguing start but in the end Next is quite a letdown.",Next

I don't know what's worse, seeing Nic Cage not just in a mullet but giving his worst career performance ever or the movie that throws every ""cool CGI"" trick in the book right at us (slow-mo bullets, exploding cars, CGI fight scenes, etc). But the worst thing about NEXT is how much it butchers an otherwise intriguing premise (based on a Philip K. Dick story) to turn it into this years hackneyed, CGI-laden sci-fi blockbuster. With a big star, a sexy female co-star, and the director of XXX on board, the producers insist that everything from logic to coherence is entirely superfluous.Cage plays Chris Johnson, a man who has the ability to see two seconds (read it again: Two seconds!) into the future, enabling him to dodge car accidents, do magic tricks, and eventually escape an FBI agent (Julianne Moore) who happens to be tracking him. See, they need him to find a nuclear device and disarm it just in time. Simple logic can be applied here, and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know exactly what's wrong here. How exactly can Johnson be of good use if he can only see two seconds into the future? Did the FBI also need the assistance of The Flash to find the bomb and disarm it within two seconds? Why not? Lots of really silly things are already happening in this movie anyway! Although the movie never really treats itself as a serious sci-fi movie, neither does the movie seem aware of just how preposterous it is. Apply the simplest of logic and you'll be surprised at just how head-scratching it is! But above all, the real problem is that, despite the abundance of special effects and chase sequences, it never comes off as exciting or even remotely interesting. Seeing Nicolas Cage dodging a bullet just in the nick of time was supposed to be cool, but it comes of as superfluous and just lousy. Director Lee Tamahori has a history in some bloated, overblown CGI fest, but this has to be his worst. Never has CGI-induced action felt quite as boring as in this film. The performances are nothing special at best, just plain bad at worst (Nic Cage and his mullet both deserve Razzies).

We didn't expect a good story and a solid evening of entertainment. Surprise, surprise! Compounding the stupid promotion material for this picture, Paramount saddled it with an instant-box-office-death title.

78,carbuff,"Not all Philip K. Dick adaptations are ""Blade Runner"" grade",5,30 December 2019,"I decided to give ""Next"" a chance despite it's many mixed reviews, not to mention the worse-than-mixed track record of Nicolas Cage. (Does Cage ever pass a paycheck by? Isn't he squared-away with the IRS yet? Otherwise, I'm thinking he's got the same agent as Samuel Jackson.)It is imperative that once you've committed to watching this film, you see it through to the bitter end. I felt that it began at around 6 stars and was showing promise, but after about an hour it was maybe scraping along at about 4 stars. I was regretting my wasted time, but since there wasn't too much left, I figured I'd just see it out. The production values throughout are no better than prime-time, over-the-air, network TV. The plot continued to bump along in a predictable manner, right up through the routine final action scene, but, literally in the last minute or two, it popped back up from 4 to 5 stars. Apparently, unlike the protagonist in this story, I can't see 2 minutes into the future. I'd probably give it a higher rating, except that I was feeling ""I should just turn this off"" for way too long before reaching the final gratifying payoff.Like another reviewer, I also thought that the love interest who could have been Cage's daughter and completely falls for him in hours was simply too much, no matter how good it makes guys our age feel. (The situation was actually exactly like Cage's last real world marriage, which was shortly thereafter followed by the divorce or annulment. Life imitating art?) I'm not going to get all moralizing about it, but let's get real. I'm no Rock Hudson (in which case, I suppose, it wouldn't matter anyway), but I'm not a troll either, and the only time I actually see this kind of mating behavior in real life is when the guy is rich and/or famous--a certain president comes to mind, for instance.I might as well discuss Jessica Biel more directly, who's quite annoying as usual. We're supposed to make some deep emotional connection with her, but she comes across as nothing more than empty-headed eye candy (with a heart of gold, of course). The ugly truth is that it's obvious Biel has been coasting through life on her exceptional physical beauty, as opposed to beating herself up with, for example, troubling doubts about the nature of causality or the causes and dangers of extreme wealth inequality. (Some of my cynicism and bitterness is no doubt just me nursing an ancient grudge against high school cheerleaders who never even noticed I existed.) Admittedly though, her ""acting"" talent has taken her a lot further than I'll ever get.While we're discussing flaws in this production, it's hard not to mention ""The Bad Guys"". I mean, really? Could they possibly be more stereotypical and straight out of countless other films and TV shows (and probably Saturday morning cartoons, if those still exist). I'm pretty sure that they just put out a casting call for ""Eurotrash Terrorists"" and left it at that. You say they have a nuclear bomb? I'm shocked, shocked to find out that gambling is going on here!So, all things considered, ""Next"" is maybe slightly better than average and has only one really good party trick, which you have to wait more than 90 minutes to get to. I don't hate myself for watching it, but there are an awful lot of better ways I could have spent my time. Still, there aren't that many good Sci-Fi movies out there, and I've seen a lot worse. Talk about an ambivalent review. I better just stop.",Next
79,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Good. Not cheesy, Not overblown. Just pretty darn good.",8,28 April 2007,"Cris Johnson has the ability to see 2 minutes into his own future. He works a low-level magic act in Las Vegas with this secret ability and also makes money gambling. However, an FBI Agent sees his uncanny ability to foresee the immediate future and tries to get him to foil a terrorist plot.The basic plot outline above isn't wholly exciting and can initially smell of outdated Cold War plot lines. And seeing that it is in the hands of Hollywood in the form of big budget action vehicle it will definitely turn many viewers off. The recent highly contrived sci-fi action movie ""Deja Vu"" is also another potential unfair strike against this movie. But, be clear of doubt, this film is actually good and it succeeds in being intriguing and not cheesy at the same time - completely unlike the ""Deja Vu."" ""Next"" leaves a lot to the audience's imagination and certain things are there just for you to accept on the basis that this is a movie - no lengthy pseudo-science speeches here. The movie also makes very good use of computer effects - there aren't many and the few that there are, aren't awful looking like director Lee Tamahori's last feature ""XXX: The State of the Union."" Johnson's clairvoyance is shown in a clever way and the story takes several nice turns. There is the stock Hollywood romantic angle here, but cheesiness is mercifully spared as it is not over done, but actually played out humorously in certain scenes.Then the kicker is the ending, which I dare not give away, and it is a real breath of fresh air. It leaves you a lot to think about and that ultimately ends this film with, not a bang which many people might expect from a big-budget action-fest. No, definitely not a bang, but a hum. That hum will stay with you for a while after you finish watching as you think about what happened and what may still happen. --- 8/10Rated PG-13 for violence",Next
80,jrarichards,"Convincing, sparingly-made sci fi thriller with compelling romantic thread",8,19 March 2016,"In this Lee Tamahori sci fi-thriller, the role of (anti-ish) hero Cris Johnson (aka ""Frank Cadillac"") allows Nicolas Cage to achieve what he often strives to - but quite often fails to - in movies, i.e. attract the sympathy and understanding of the filmgoing audience. On the face of it, things don't look too promising, given that Johnson inhabits the familiar Cage habitat of Las Vegas, where he performs a mixture of future-predicting and simple magic tricks to far less than packed houses. He's not averse to a bit of sleazy stuff (this is Vegas after all), and his life is not going anywhere much, though he does have some kind of support-system at home thanks to a character of unknown category called ""Irv"", who appears in a very brief scene but nevertheless makes a remarkably big mark thanks to being portrayed by Peter (Columbo) Falk, whom it proves surprisingly - if quite tangibly - pleasant to come across again, in this sparse but satisfying cameo role. In fact, this sets a kind of a trend for the film, for Cage is at his best here, just as is that not-always-compelling actress here doing very good things, Julianne Moore. She is an FBI agent interested in Johnson because her observations of him for some time convince her that he has genuine abilities to see the future deliberately played down to allow him to go on leading an anonymous life. This is indeed the case, and it is clear from the outset that, while the ability earns Johnson a modest-ish living, and allows him to avoid certain problems, it also represents a major burden in itself that he doesn't especially want, and would definitely prefer not to put at the disposal of Uncle Sam.As it turns out, Johnson (mostly) only sees 2 minutes into the future, and rather just his own future. Having suspended disbelief this far, one might well consider that such a ""gift"" would most likely prove entirely impossible to adjust to or compensate for, even if one could. Yet clearly Johnson has got used to it, even if it is also a tiresome weight on his shoulders.So far it's all a bit downbeat and small-time, but what adds a great deal in this story (originally from no less a writer than Philip Dick) is that Johnson has one event from the further future he's also been able to see - a meeting with the woman of his dreams which he knows the hour and place of, but not the day. Given that, when this meeting does indeed materialise, it is with an astoundingly, mesmerisingly good-looking Jessica Biel in the role of Liz Cooper (who also turns out to be a warm and kind person), we can readily sympathise with the character who believes this love might help lift him out of his burdensome existence.This romance, and the warm feelings it inspires, give a very great deal to the movie, not least also a bit of comedy, as Johnsons's ""2-minute"" thing allows him to go through a multitude of different first-line chat-up scenarios, which invariably fail to work with the lovely newcomer.The FBI have a real task for Johnson to perform, and at first they think (wrongly) that coercion might be as effective as cooperation. However Moore's Agent Ferris soon realises the error of this, especially when she grasps Johnson's romantic motivations for doing the right thing. Given (notwithstanding) their typical features as actors - Moore and Cage offer a surprisingly effective and appealing on-film partnership. There are several pretty major plot twists and one very major one, and a few really spectacular moments, especially at the Grand Canyon, several less well-known facets of which we also get to see and appreciate in the course of what looks like (and can be enjoyed as) a mini ""road-movie"" segment.There are also some nice touches when Johnson does indeed live up to Ferris's expectations and uses his gifts to save life repeatedly, while ensuring appropriate comeuppances for the bad-guys (of which there seem at times to be hordes).Somehow it all gels well enough, and all the more so given that a great deal is left unshown and unsaid. One is absolutely not used to such economy in films, especially films of this genre, and here it pays dividends. It remains surprisingly fresh throughout, and in many ways we are left with the idea that (despite the critical and grand-scale nature of the threat that Johnson is roped in by the FBI to avert), this film is also very much about the overriding need in all of us to find the right person to love - a prize for which we are naturally prepared to do a very great deal, and put up with a very great deal. In the end, one cannot fail to empathise with the joy - but also the burden and fragility and chanciness - of being given the chance to envision one's perfect mate with which to pass through life.",Next

The story was unrealistic, but interesting. The cast members weren't too bad either. I liked Nicholas Cage as the protagonist, Jessica Biel as Cage's lover, and Julianne Moore as the persistent and determined government agent.But the one thing that bothered me with this movie was the ending. Okay, Cage's character has the ability to see two minutes into the future. Then how all of the sudden can he see the events 24 hours ahead and then leave the movie with a cliffhanger? There needed to be at least another twenty or thirty minutes to explain the ending and show the dramatic conclusion unless there is to be a sequel. Either way, it was poor excuse of an ending.

Since I liked all movies based on Philip K. Dick stories so far, I figured I might give ""Next"" a try even though reviews hadn't exactly been raving about the flick.Well, ""Next"" deserves its reputation. Everything here is wrong, except for the promising premise of the original story. The casting choices are terrible. There is absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between Nicolas Cage and Jessica Biel (and both act horribly). The CGI is laughable. No effect in the whole movie looks convincing. Hell, even the stylist did a bad job. How else could you explain the terrible wig-like hairstyles of Cage and Julianne Moore? Finally, the story literally goes nowhere. This is one of the most unsatisfying endings I've ever seen (although there is something satisfying about it, and that is that the movie ENDS).How anyone can release a movie like ""Next"" in 2007 and expect it to be successful, is beyond me.

But titles mean nothing.This film just got sillier and sillier as the gifted magician (Nicholas Cage) used his special powers to counter future events. Winding back time is not a new theme in movies. Experts have been sent back in time to change events thus saving the world from disaster. It's a case of wishful thinking that's beyond belief. Messing around with time seems to have fascinated lots of writers.I like imaginative stories, but this one did not inspire me. The idea of a Government using a gifted person to locate and defuse a nuclear bomb seemed a bit far-fetched to me. After all, his seeing into the future was limited to 2 minutes, so he had to work very fast with events that changed every minute.The huge cast and crew and costly production was such a waste.

Like so many Hollywood tries at Dick's material, it goes off on too much of a tangent as this was conceived as a big-budget action flick. Still, the movie has its moments. Nic Cage stars as a clairvoyant who can see two minutes into the future, and is recruited by the FBI to help them find a terrorist bomb before it goes off. With the help of the fetching Jessica Biel, Cage finds he is somehow able to extend his future vision. The terrorists are onto him, and move in to assassinate him. Much has been made of the ending, which contains a bit of a twist, but not one that everyone cared for. You will have to judge for yourself. Julianne Moore goes slumming here as an FBI agent.

86,rajdoctor,Golden Man,6,28 April 2007,"I had seen the trailer of this movie and I found the story to be old  a person who can see into the future, so my expectations from the movie was low. I like Nicolas Cage and that is why I went to see this movie.The movie is about a magician Cris Johnson (Cage) who can see his own future for only 2 minutes ahead. The FBI Officer (Julianne Moore) is behind him to seek his help to uncover a nuclear weapon post in LA; the terrorist group is after him because they too want to be ahead of FBI with the help of Cage, but Cage does not want to help anyone and is on a run and his purpose is to seek a girl (Jessica Biel) whose future he can see for a longer period. The movie is about how Cage gets involved in helping FBI  only to realize in the end that he is able to save his girl friend instead of saving 8 million population of LA. The last scene of the movie (that I will not tell now and spoil the show) kept me unsatisfied with the movie.Nicolas Cage has produced the movie himself. Lee Tamahori (Sopranos, Die Another Day, Along came a Spider fame) has directed the movie. The movie is based on a novel called ""Golden Man"".Even though the story is old, the format of telling it, is new. From the first scene the director without wasting any time tells you that Cage can see his future and then takes you into unwinding of action, and never let go the pace of the movie. The movie has lots of twists and turns; mostly predictable  once we know that hero can see the future; but still maintains interest throughout.Nicolas Cage looks a bit haggard but has acted well. Juliaane Moore and beautiful Jessica Biel have nothing extra-ordinary to do and their characters help the movie go forward. The movie has some good actions scenes and few funny moments. Funny moments because the Director allows the audience to see all the options Cage can think and see in future  and then chooses one that best suiting him.I am having this feeling that Nicolas Cage is trying to re-invent himself in a much remembered screen character that can give him at least a few more innings as sequels. His choosing Ghost Rider and now this character of Next  both have tremendous scope for sequels like James Bond, Spiderman, Superman, Die Hard, etc. Sadly with box office not ticking the counters strongly  the hope of Cage does not seem to being materializing soon.(Stars 6 out of 10)",Next

It's a sometimes thoughtful pic starring a subdued Nic Cage as a man who can see just two minutes into the future, occasionally more. Playing with time perception is something films are good at and NEXT has some effective moments, imaginative and well done against this conceit, but it is lumbered with the tired old 'stop the European terrorists on a countdown with the bomb' idea as its main plot, introduced through some particularly clunky dialogue, especially jarring after the subtle opening scenes. The result is a schizophrenic film, with the most interesting moments (presumably those closest to Dick's original vision) occurring when Cage is reflecting and relating sadly to his paranormal predicament and emotions, whiles those least convincing are around the stunts, chases, or when nasty villains/tough heroes from the special forces brandish hi tech weaponry in clichéd acts of the drama strewn war on terror. At one moment the captured Cage is forced to watch TV with his eyes kept open, a scene which recalls the therapy in CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Director Lee Tamahori did the great ONCE WERE WARRIORS, and also the Bond DIE ANOTHER DAY. NEXT is a a good film but uneven enough in tone to suggest there's a quieter, more profound one trying to get out, away from the next explosive action sequence and the makers should have taken two minutes out of their day to find it.",Next

I love Phlip K. Dick(who wrote the story this was based on, and others like A Scanner Darkly, Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report, to name few), and Nicholas Cage is alright sometimes, but this one blew and blew hard. I thought up until just after the dinner scene with Jessica Beal, that this was actually not bad. Nicholos Cage can see the future but only two minutes into the future and only about himself, he can see mistakes before he makes them and correct himself before anything happens, except his observation of said events alters other outcomes. Director Lee Tamahori does a good job of illustrating this at first, by showing us Cage getting killed, caught, and making mistakes, only to jump back a seconds and show us the way he really did it as opposed to the way, and eventually multiple ways he sees things going. Though cages character can only see a few minutes deep he has had a reoccurring vision of some time in the distant future meeting a mysterious women(Jessica Beal) in a coffee shop. That was all well and good, and there's some PKD moments of witty banter, odd historical references, and interesting concepts buried throughout the film, but then everything goes action. Julianne Moore is an icy, lifeless, FBI agent trying to stop a nuclear device from being detonated in California by a group of inter-racial non specific foreign terrorists being paid by a mysterious figure who also knows about Cages secret but remains off screen. We never figure out who the bad guy is, why the ""terrorists"" are doing what they are doing, or if Cage saves LA or not. Instead PKD trademark moments of reality melting are used as an excuse to not include a third act, the movie just ends. Also the technique for displaying Cages powers get's more and more special effects driven and overbearing as the film goes on, by the credits he's doing the matrix bullet dodge dance when it earlier in the film he was just titling his head to the side to avoid stray objects, and none of it works.

The small-time magician can see 120 seconds (give or take) into his own personal future. So could he find his car in the mall parking lot if he didn't remember where he left it? No, he has to be able to find it in the future to see himself finding it in the present looking forward. Would he have known the twist at the end of ""Sixth Sense""? No, that take far more than 2 minutes to happen. Could he avoid burning the roast? No, since it take 2 hours at 425 degrees for the roast to burn, he wouldn't be able to detect that. Apparently, his second sight also can be a little fritz-y like when he needs to be told the bridge has washed out and he will need to return to a hotel 2 miles back - shouldn't he have seen that coming? So why does Julianne Moore's hard-as-nails FBI agent strap him ""Clockwork Orange"" style to a chair to try to predic when a nuclear bomb devastates Los Angeles and ushers in the era of Skynet? Um....not sure. At best Frank / Chris could only give them a 1 minute 55 second head start to tracking down a bomb, gaining entry to it and defusing it somewhere in LA's 5,721 square miles of traffic-clogged streets. Cage gives his Hello Kitty neutral performance but Moore belies some puzzlement over the plot. Viewers puzzle over Cage's standoffish magician beating up several burly FBI agents once freed from the Clockwork Orange chair as well as the fact that while the room he was held in was locked, the remainder of the building allows for him to saunter out unobstructed. Jessica Biel plays the hot girl who teaches underprivileged Native Americans and brings them birthday presents even when it's not her day to work. She also hooks up with a bad magician who claims super- limited clairvoyance, later sells him out to the FBI and then sells the FBI out to him all in the space of standoff with views of the Grand Canyon. She may not be particularly good at decision-making. What the movie lacks in interesting characters and dubious plotting, it also lacks in decent dialog particularly among the French-speaking bad guys who we are told early in the movie are Russians out to blow up Los Angeles. You don't expect a Cage character to do more than yell and run about but Moore's character spends the movie shouting orders menacingly - you imagine she's not much fun at the FBI offices annual holiday party.

But now although he is wanted for peoples films, it does seem that around the time he did this movie, only bad movies wanted him, or he was choosing them himself. This is an example of bad acting, and how a movie suffers because of it and coupled with bad directing and writing too, you fast come to realise that some movies just aren't that well made.It kind of made me a little sad that Paramount ploughed $70 million dollars into this movie when it quite obviously could have been used on something much more thought provoking. Now don't get me wrong this film has it's moments and the premise isn't so bad, a guy can see two minutes into the future meaning he basically can just get away from everyone who ever is after him and also run an albeit poor magic show. The story plays out like any other typical movie plot, well maybe not all of it but the set up is anyway, the ending is different I'll give it that, but also kind of annoying too.Cage isn't the only person here giving nothing to their character, Julianne Moore is poor too and when the actors so highly regarded are not good at what they do, you know this movie is hazardous. Jessica Biel joins the poor acting parade and along with Cage makes no effort to create any chemistry or feeling and that by the end you feel there is nowhere for this movie to go. Lee Tamahori is the director and it is just not good whatsoever, not only does he make the poor acting look even worse, he also just couldn't make the Sci- Fi like plot exciting.Now I'm not going to sit here and say for 96 minutes I watched a movie that nearly killed me(maybe shouldn't have used the word hazardous), but this movie isn't one that is very enjoyable. It has it's moments of stunts, thrills and car chases plus a few gun battles to spice things up, but there in lies the problem. The movie could have been mindful and really struck a cord about what time means to people, what could we do with Cage's power in which we only really see showcased within the first 30 minutes in a way that looks cool.I do want to think of some positives, after all I stuck by this and said it was a bad movie and not an awful one, oh I am nice. The score isn't half bad, shame it had to be used on this movie but Mark Isham creates a nice blend of instruments to make some scenes kind of thrilling. I also felt the camera angles were nice, it followed the action nicely and yet again maybe made them slightly better, David Tattersall making a good job out of a bad movie.Overall this is one movie I would recommend you miss, now of course you get people who enjoy this kind of stuff and fair enough, but just watch this carefully and tell me it isn't lazy work. I do hope one day I can see Nicolas Cage fine again, I want to see every actor do well and every film as well but Cage at this stage of his career seems lost, it's as if he wants to make bad movies and really working with Tamahori turned out to be a bad decision.",Next

Cage plays a Las Vegas magician who has the quirky power of perception to be able to predict his own future two minutes in advance. That's both weird and specific, yet there's nothing the least bit whimsical about the way all of this plays out. In walks the wasted talent of the fabulous Julianne Moore, a government agent (or some such) who already knows his secret and is fully prepared to use him to thwart some under-explained terrorist plot.But wait, there's more! Julianne Moore is getting up there in age, so the Hollywood big shots figured the youth market need to have a love interest with the body of Jessica Biel thus tossing in a love interest played by Biel who Cage could see coming into his life long before his idiotic 120 second mark. This bending of Cage's clairvoyant radar system allows for all sorts of plot holes to be filled by his ""gift"", which ultimately makes for one speedy, if spoon fed, journey.

Apparently, these were all short stories so I guess they might be cool to read instead of a full paperback. NEXT moves at a nice pace, has enough action and some romance to keep everyone happy but eventually ends on a sort of lame note. All the ""seeing into the future"" sequences are well directed since the movie doesn't dwell into explaining the core of things. They just do the scenes right. Still, NEXT could've been a much better, rounded picture had it had a better screenplay or adaptation.",Next
99,arieliondotcom,La Cage Aux Folles (Or Nick Cage Looks like a Fool),7,27 May 2008,"The plot of this movie has more holes than a golf course. An erstwhile magician/clairvoyant/tough guy wannabe is somehow involved in trying to find a nuclear bomb hidden somewhere in Los Angeles and gets laid by a babe in the process. Okaayyyy....Well, we've learned to suspend our disbelief in all of those Die Hard movies with Bruce Willis. The problem is, Nicholas Cage is no Bruce Willis. Whether deliberately or not, he comes across as frumpy and wimpy so the Die Hard like supernatural survival when he defeats a bunch of armed, trained Soldiers in hand-to-hand combat, etc. is more laughable than enjoyable. He looks more like Beals' father than her lover, which also kind of turns your stomach (which is sad since the last thing you want when looking at a good-looking woman is nausea). And, of course, he's clairvoyant. He proves this by predicting commercials on a TV screen. Whoa...Now THAT is something! Only he can't tell what's going on all around him and needs to ask his girlfriend half the time what's going on. And then there's that Dallas-like ending if you're old enough to remember the famous Dallas shower scene. Anyway, it's more of a hit than a miss, but I predict that if you watch it too carefully you'll be disappointed. So only watch it if you're willing to keep one eye shut and the other on Beals.",Next
100,Jerique,Next - Review,3,4 November 2009,"Nicholas Cage is far from super stardom and with this disasterpiece, he cascades his faulty talents running on low. Next is about a man named Cris (Cage) who has this odd ability to see 2 minutes into the future.I'm going to start off by saying how unrealistic and illogical it is to have such an ability. Sure, it's unrealistic, that's obvious. But being able to see into the future would be cool, however, they show you few of the endless amounts of possible futures. Given the fact we can't make nor want to watch a 78+ hour long film, I understand their reasoning to trim down the possible futures shown. Still, it makes me agitated to watch this 100 minute movie and leave with nothing but the question of ""why?"" If I'd want an ability related to the future, I'd want to be able to control it, not view it. Viewing a possible future doesn't prepare you.The special effects aren't as special as you'd like to think. They are cheap crafted and give no effect to the viewer. The story is dogmatic and unbelievable as much as the romantic bond of the stars. Cage has ceased being my ""go-to actor"" ever since City of Angels and I find myself questioning: ""why do I continue to give his films a chance?"" Save yourself from this film and skip on to the ""Next"" film.",Next
101,basrutten,Good idea deserved a better movie,4,27 December 2007,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS Philip K Dick stories have always been great material for movies, and some of the films based on his tales (Total Recall, Minority Report, Blade Runner) are actually good or even great movies. However, over the last years the Dick adaptations seem to steadily get worse.The poorest installment (so far) is 'Next', a movie with a nice idea and what seems a very lazy and awkward implementation. The premise, about a man that can look two minutes in the future and use that knowledge to select the best possible path to follow, is very interesting. Sadly, there are only a handful of scenes that really explore this idea. The scene in which Cage tries out various opening lines till he finds one that works is great fun, and the parts in which he evades danger by simply trying out alternatives and picking the ones that don't kill him, are pretty clever as well, and nicely visualized.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie feels like a very lazy attempt. It's pretty short, it ends abruptly, and what passes for a story is not really going anywhere. Cage somehow ends up as the target for some French (I know the French are not popular in the states after 9/11, but this is pushing it) terrorists who for some unknown reason want to detonate a nuclear device and somehow they want Cage dead since he can apparently foil their plans (while the smart thing would have been to just keep him and Biel out of it). Nothing much is explained, which is probably a pretty good thing since it makes really no sense whatsoever.Perhaps even worse is the romance (for lack of a better word) between Jessica Biel and Cage. This is easily one of the least plausible and convincing relationships ever captured on camera, and it shows. And since it plays a pretty large part in the movie, it's hard to overlook.And then, when you finally think the movie might still be going somewhere, it just ends. I like clever and unexpected endings quite a bit, but this one was just unexpected. And it makes no sense. The only reason Cage could have possibly stopped the nuke from going off, is Jessica Biel. If he insists that she is kept out of it, he will only be able to watch 2 minutes into the future, he will be utterly useless in stopping the bomb.'Next' has an interesting premise, but an utterly unconvincing implementation. It's short, it's lazy, and in the end it crashes even harder than Cage's career seems to be crashing.",Next
102,CineCritic2517,From Clearvoyant to Superman to Neo,1,8 June 2007,"The premise seemed alright; the man who's been haunted all his life with the gift to see two minutes into the future holds a magic show in Vegas and makes some money on the side by gambling with his talent at the blackjack-table. So far so good.But from the premise up, 'Next' crusades from one implausible scene to the next impossible one. With terrible cheesy dialog and completely miscast leads the film abandons all its great opportunities to be something entertaining in less than 15 minutes. In stead it becomes one of the most dreadfully fleshed out action-movies I've seen in a long time. And when I say that, you should know that I recently saw Rocky VIII and Children of Men Where Cage can only see two minutes into the future in the beginning of the movie, he can already predict 2 hours into the future half way through the film. Mapping complete city blocks in his head as well as booby trapped rooms and predicting more possible scenario's than a host of chess-masters could work out together in a day. By the end of this movie you can add dodging bullets to that and of course saving some 15 million people as he saves the day in the most gruesome violation of intellect being the 'ending' of this ultra bad flick.This film is simply appalling to watch because it's not only crammed with all the ridiculous action-flick clichés while nothing of what you see makes any sense at all, it stands out as a cinematic giant in ripping off the hard earned dollar of the average Joe who goes to the theatre to be at least entertained. This movie may have tried to do that but comes off bludgeoning its audience with the familiar feeling of being set up.Not even recommended for a lazy Friday night with a crate of beer as your best friend. Just leave this film in the flopbox of $0.50 DVD's and see something else in stead.",Next
103,fung0,"Impressive SF, actually sticks to its guns",8,8 April 2008,"I suppose it's inevitable that this film would put off some people. It's that rarity, a science fiction film that actually sticks to its premise, and takes it to the appropriate conclusion.First, the visual style. The film is painted using a sort of hyper-intense palette that perfectly suits the subject matter. The settings, in Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and Los Angeles, give the film a feeling of being lost in the desert... which mirrors the state of mind of the lead character. The camera movements and use of slo-mo heighten our sense of Cage's unique perspective. In short, I loved looking at every frame of it.Acting? I'm no great fan of Nicolas Cage, but I felt he really fit this part. He plays a guy who's been simultaneously blessed and cursed, and for Cage that's a specialty. Jessica Biel is, as usual, highly appealing in more ways than one. Despite her looks, she has a powerful ability to convey vulnerability, and to generate emotional involvement. Julianne Moore is rock-solid, of course: credible but not likable... which is exactly what's called for. And the French terrorists... who cares? They're not really a major part of the story. The whole nuclear-terrorism plot might as well have ""Macguffin"" stenciled on it in big red letters.The story? It's about Cage's relationship with the rest of the human race... and nothing else. The dramatic arc is his alone, and it is perfectly executed. Along the way, you've got action, romance, humor, drama... all at a rapid-fire pace that leaves you wanting more, more, more. You've even got intellectual stimulation; Cage's use of precognition is explored in every conceivable way, leading to the sort of 'wow' insights you rarely get in a mere action film.The ending? My absolute favorite thing about this film! It ends when the dramatic arc is complete... NOT when action-film conventions might dictate. I applaud Lee Tamahori for doing it this way, and actually getting it past the Hollywood committee system. Anyone who thinks the ending was wrong simply wasn't paying attention... all the signals are fairly planted along the way.For me, Next immediately leaps to the high ranks of Philip K Dick adaptations, and to the very pinnacle of the oft-mishandled time-travel genre. (It reminded me of Retroactive, another 'small' time-travel film that really gets it right... albeit in a very different way.) If you like sci-fi at all, and don't mind having your expectations challenged a bit, you definitely need to give Next a chance.",Next
104,virindra,Weird ending.,7,11 November 2007,"I like movies of Nicolas Cage. I only did not like that hair-dress of Cage in this movie, it makes him so much older. Cage can see into the future for 2.16 minutes. That's great! The FBI wants him to capture some terrorists. Cage wants to find a girl, because with her, he can see more than 2.16 seconds into the future.There was something wrong in the restaurant scene where he meets that girl. He stands up to meet her, but she rejects after he says something. Then he rewinds the time and tries it an other way. But the third time she rejects him before he said something. That was weird, could she look into the future also? The action sequences were great. The special effects were sometimes fake, like the way the train missed his car, or the time he runs from a hill and the car is flying over him. Even the movements of Cage in those sequences were very fake. They were no natural movements. I have seen Cage in better movies.I was surprised to see my hero in a movie again; Peter Falk. He was the cherry on the pie. What a great actor, what a small role. Only this pie did not have much cream in it. Movie was okay, the ending was weird.",Next
105,monkeysgalore,Nicolas Cage + Action and Science Fiction + Jessica Biel = Very Watchable Movie,7,21 March 2020,"""Next"" was about as entertaining as a Nicolas Cage action movie can be. Overblown and preposterous, but also entertaining. The sci-fi element is cool, and it was nice to see the movie utilize it almost to its fullest extent rather than ignore it and just thrown in the standard action scenes.Lee Tamahori is a good director, I think. He has an interesting filmography, and is probably best known for ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Die Another Day"", which were both good, if underwhelming. Tamahori's style is noticeable here. If you don't know what I'm talking about, he's known for overblown action scenes and a reliance on often bad CGI. Well the special effects here are definitely a step-up from his previous works, and look at least somewhat realistic.This movie definitely owes a lot to ""Deja Vu"", another sci-fi action movie from 2006. That movie, which is definitely better, also had a time-related plot where the hero had visions from the future, and there was a bomb and a girl's life was at stake. Tamahori also aped director Tony Scott's style in this movie, as it even looks like ""Deja Vu"" too, with quick fast cuts, flashy and colorful scenes, and a glossy look. Even if it is a rip-off, it works.The action scenes are good enough. The car chase near the beginning was ok, though not that memorable, the mountain scene was pretty cool, the fight scene and street chase was well done, and the long shootout on the docks was pretty nice. If you want loud, explosive action, this movie will give it to you.Nicolas Cage and Jessica Biel were both good, and actually pretty much the best parts of the movie. Julianne Moore was ok, but the villains were completely forgettable. They didn't actually have very much screen time either, which didn't help.Worth a watch. Check out ""Deja Vu"" too, which is way better, because Tony Scott did it and it has Denzel Washington.",Next
106,Ziya90,It is not similar with any movie you have ever seen,5,18 December 2009,"Next begins with an entertaining scene occurs in a casino that Cris Johnson works. Then, the bitter fact manifests itself, because the first action scene is an animation! Not CGI, it was obviously an animation. The scene in the bar is comedy. Why Nicolas Cage has become a funny man in serious action movies, science fiction/fantasy movies? It was the same in Ghost Rider. And also Nicolas Cage's performances have become shallow for a few movies. I don't know why. In this movie, he is not only at his worst, his performance is nondescript. He is like a man who loses himself. Julianne Moore's performance, oh dear, is below average, yes impossible to believe for such a great actress, she is too straight faced and too soulless, emotionless like the movie. Even Jessica Biel's performance is much more realistic and persuasive than Cage and Moore. I thank my stars that the second action scene is not an animation, but it is an eyesore CGI and hollow, in contrast offers fun. The third action scene looks like very bad computer games. There is only one good thing. In some moments, the film shows us the possibilities as if they are real. And the movie flies by, very flowing which might make the movie better. The most odd thing besides the performances is that things develop too quickly. It is like you are gifted. Yes, I am. We need you. I cannot help. He is just a magician. No, sir. Then, capture him. The reactions of people are like that. I said to myself what is going on here? May be the most odd action movie of all times.",Next

108,jemps918,unexpectedly funny,7,18 June 2007,"Nicolas Cage is comfortable playing Las Vegas magician Cris Johnson in the fun action/sci-fi thriller Next. Cris has the uncanny ability to see two minutes into his future, which compels FBI Agent Ferris (played by a stony-faced Julianne Moore) to convince Cris to help stop a nuclear bomb from going off in LA. Sick of government experiments he was exposed to since childhood, Cris is reluctant, until he discovers that it will ultimately cost the life of Liz, the girl of his dreams (Jessica Biel).Based on the Philip K. Dick story The Golden Man, Next is satisfactorily directed by Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day, Along Came a Spider). The movie is entertaining, especially since the dialogue remained light and didn't assume a serious philosophical route; plus, the action sequences are solid.It was puzzling, though, to see Biel in a damsel-in-distress role that could've easily been played by any starlet. Her athletic assets take a backseat to her exotic beauty, which could not have been stressed enough by the lovestruck Cris. Those moments, fortified by the lack of believable chemistry between Cris and Liz, were almost always on the brink of comedy, which made the movie unexpectedly funny as well.",Next
109,j-lacerra,Suspend Belief,8,16 March 2009,"Next is an interesting premise picture in the action venue that requires that you suspend your belief and settle down to some escapist entertainment. Many good movies require this, so don't pick on Next. We are asked to believe that Cage can see two minutes into the future, his own, and act to change it. This allows him to do a small time magic act and win some small time gambling money, and stay out of the limelight.The FBI needs him to help avert a terrorist nuclear plot, although it is never really defined as to who by or why the plot is to be executed. We meet the terrorists, but they are not developed. Partly a chase movie and partly an ESP movie, with a splash of romance, Next perks along smartly, fast enough that you don't get to dwell on these and other plot holes. The scene of Cage escaping from a situation and taking down an entire antique farm equipment exhibit with him is great.Acting: Cage is in decent form for this movie, albeit with an inexplicable hairstyle and dye job. Julianne Moore, the most over-rated actress in Hollywood, is less obnoxious than usual in her butch portrayal of the super-competent FBI agent-in-charge. The real treat here is Jessica Biel; the camera loves her astonishing beauty and here she is not really asked to exercise her acting chops, just to be natural and beautiful, which she does quite well.Fast-paced and with decent CGI, Next delivers a good action movie experience.

Jessica Biel was really pretty, though.""Next"" is just lame and predictable and strangely unexciting. Probably not a good thing if you are making an action film.

He is certainly one of my favourite actors & the whole film was taken care by him because it is very complicated to act like someone who has the ability to see into the future. The movie had a really good story about Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) who can see 2 minutes into the future very clearly and the police needed his help to stop a terrorist attack who had threaten to detonate a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles killing millions of people. The best thing about the film is that you don't know which scene is in the present or the future, so it is completely unpredictable right from start to end.

The story is a hell simple but you don't know whether Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is seeing in his vision or in the real world. Some scenes surprised me. When you watch it, you should know. The plot is dead simple, you get Cris Johnson, a magician, performing cheap tricks in somewhere of Las Vegas but when a group of terrorist threatens to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles, Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore), government agent, must capture him in order to convince him to help them stop the nuclear bombing. And Cris keeps escaping from them and you get a mindless blowing action movie. It is fun to see what Cris has up to his sleeves.Jessica Biel did a good job to in her character. In all, it seems to be a short flick, I did not realise that time was passing so fast. By the time Cris got caught, it is already going to finish and when by the time it ends, you don't know. If you like movies like this, then go ahead to watch it. But, hell yeah, the ending is a bit out of we expected. It does have the action if there is a need to.

113,David_Frames,"The thing about looking at Next is once you look at it, it's different, because you looked at it.",6,4 May 2007,"Say what you want about Nicolas Cage because if you don't I will, but one charge that will never be on the indictment at the man's crimes against cinema trial is that he doesn't have a sense of humour. Recently in Rob Zombie's Grindhouse trailer for Werewolf man of the SS, Cage was stunt cast for all of 7 seconds as oriental criminal mastermind Fu Manchu. That's not a bad joke you're saying to yourself but wait a minute, you haven't seen him as Frank Cadillac in Next yet! Unless you're allergic to laughter, and I mean badly so that any involuntary muscular contractions could aggravate your osteoporosis and snap your spine, you should be booking tickets as you read this because if there's a more ridiculous thriller this year, I'd sit in a chair with semtex strapped to my chest like Jennifer Biel and get blown to smithereens.Very loosely based on a Phillip K. Dick story, in the same way that Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour was loosely based on historical events, Next is about a fifth rate Vegas magician who can see 2 minutes into the future. Handy, you'd think but someone, as we're told in an extraordinary expositionary scene featuring a very bad tempered Julianne Moore as the FBI agent on Cage's case, has stolen a nuke and they need Cage to find out where it'll be so they can get there far too late. Doesn't sound too bad does it? But Next plays like a distended spoof that schizophrenically imagines itself to be a serious movie. When Cage is on the run at the casino you're a liar if you've ever heard a government spook scream into his radio ""gift shop, gift shop, gift shop!"" before but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Cage lives with Columbo, here revealing where he went after he left the plot of Fracture and is obsessed with Biel, who allows him to see further into the future than the obligatory 120 seconds but crucially for Next's star rating, not her chest, that's covered by sheets that stay in place no matter how far in the bed she sits up. And who said movies were better than life? This loophole is exploited so that Cage's gift remains inconsistent throughout the film. Usually potentially plot stunting conceits are changed in sequels when they cause problems  remember Highlander 2? No? Well thank Christ for that but here the 2 minute rule doesn't even last to the half way mark. Not only goes the period of Cage's clairvoyance shift as the story demands but sometimes it changes to the point where it threatens to scupper the entire plot. Without explanation Cage develops a gift to see multiple versions of the same two minutes to facilitate a few reheated Groundhog Day jokes but the screenwriters really hit their devil may care stride during the final third where, in one of the films many bonkers sequences, he develops the ability to split into multiple versions of himself and search an entire area  a sort of two minute zone if you like. Could he have done this earlier and saved an hour? You bet, but maybe it was written in a kind of screen writers' guild version of the game where you write the first line of a story, fold over the paper bar the last line and let someone write the next part with hilarious results. This alone would explain the Dallas ending, in which disbelief isn't so much suspended to breaking point but fired and given two minutes to clear its desk. If couldn't be more ridiculous if Cage's character had imploded after eating a chocolate.But good as Cage is, in an awful sort of way, it would be criminal to ignore the contribution of Julianne Moore. We may never know what Lee Tamahori said to her, the man who's directorial muscle went into spasm to produce Die Another Day but 'remember you're an aggressive, no nonsense FBI agent' might not be too far off the mark. That or Moore discovered her agent had negotiated a pay deal linked to gross points, just before shooting began, effectively meaning she was going it all for free. Whatever the reason, her scowl, fixed from the off and present to the bitter end is enough to melt steel. When she isn't looking at Cage as though she were about to chew through his joy sack, she's shooting at a cardboard target...really really hard and storming off after shouting at her bosses. She even looks depressed after Cage has saved her life. It's a nice gesture but letting her be crushed by some falling logs might have been kinder in the long run.So Next is great fun, anchored by some poor plotting, unlikely romancing (would you really love a man who'd contrived to have you kidnapped and strapped to explosives by terrorists?) and pretty poor effects work but its nice to see the Amiga back in use. Go and see it, you owe it to yourself, not to mention that girlfriend you've been trying to get rid of but can't because you don't have the friggin' guts.",Next

The acting of Nicolas Cage wasn't that bad but I felt like he is just working off the entire movie, without any desire to ""wake"" sleepy acting team. Jessica Biel looks good but she needs to work a lot more if she wants to be some kind of star (although I don't think she can act in serious roles).

That meme has just been used once too many, and ""Next"" does not make particularly good use of it. Mainly, the reason for this deus ex machina plot twist seems to be that director Lee Tamahori wanted to show a gratuitous nuclear explosion in LA. Well, then at least make it really slow mo and show us some devastation.

119,The_Orenda,It could have been better...,4,31 October 2007,"I love Philip Dick's stories. In my eyes, he's a complete original. And in many science fiction films, be it Silent Running or even The 6th Day, I tend to critique a film not only on overall performance but for the very concept itself, because sci-fi deserves that kind of leverage when you forsake a story itself towards your imagination. But Next was an injustice towards that imagination. You take a brilliant idea of a man who can see a couple minutes ahead of everyone else and you somehow miscue on it. Nic Cage was miscast, as was Ms. Moore, and there was no real thought put into the film after the first half hour. Potential, here, was wasted unfortunately.By night, 'Frank Cadillac' lives his life pulling cheap magic and keeping things simple as things can be in Las Vegas. But the real 'Frank,' Cris Johnson, has a born ability to see roughly two minutes ahead of his own future, leaving most options open to the best of his ability. But the government has an interest, and the FBI, an imminent threat, that maybe only he can crack available, but first, he must somehow piece how he can see further ahead being with one woman.The opening scene, in the casino, held much, clever, promise for the film. But Next somehow falters when it pairs Jessica Biel with Nicholas Cage. I think Ms. Biel was the best casting choice in the entire film, but there's a point in the movie, at the reservation site, when Cage looks back at her and you can see the lead role was done wrong. It was a clever film, with good choreography and good timing based on a film with time as key, but Next could have done better. Most of the scenes involving FBI, the bad guys, and the case of the nuke itself, were incorrectly done.",Next

Which is totally ridiculous and implausible as you think he would be a billionaire in a matter of months with that ability. The FBI apparently know all about him and are seeking to track down terrorists instead of taking him to the horse racing track as they would do in real life. His girlfriend inexplicably gets taken as a hostage by the very same terrorists that the FBI headed by Julie Anne Moore's Character are seeking. The whole thing becomes hopelessly pathetic and starts to drag on like an Australian feature. Such a shame the Genius of Philip K. Dick was not treated more intelligently.

The plot is interesting and lends itself to fun visuals which appear throughout. The characters are pretty stereotypically antagonistic lacking depth and the relationship building is average. This kind of movie does use the weird future sight mechanic quickly without warning which, if you are not paying close enough attention, can catch you off guard. Lastly the setting where Chris and Liz hideout is very nice, it gives you the feeling like you wish you could vacation there.",Next

However, the execution, script, cheesy, cheesy, cheesy, utterly lame as all hell actual movie is another thing.I really like Nicolas Cage, it's just a shame I can't watch anything he's in anymore because all the stuff he makes is terrible, most likely due to no fault of his, since he's got to pay his bills, right.Both female leads, from the naïve - I'll walk around all wet in a towel in front of a total strange guy I picked up and gave a lift to, but hey, he won't rape me - to the hard-nosed ugly cow with the ugly voice, give this no credence, just add to the scratching of fingernails on a chalk board.The idea of a magician who's actually psychic... wow, what they COULD have done with this idea might have been fantastic.

In this movie, we get to read his mind. Many times it seems like we're just watching some video game and Cage moves about like some star from the arcade, doubling, tripling, infinitizing himself. Periodically there is a plot, but then it seems to become a derivative of itself... again and again. And then there is the most confusing part. They keep talking about a ""bomb."" I thought they were talking about something that was going to blow up in the movie. It wasn't until the very end that I discovered they were talking about what was going to happen at the box office. In fact, they were all so discouraged (Cage must have looked into the future a couple of weeks) that they all gave up and went home before they found the best derivative ending... leaving the set with NO ending.

His only future vision is of a woman that he eventually meets -- Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel). Parallel to this is a nuclear warhead heist and agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is among the FBI agents looking for it. Somehow she comes to the realization of Cris having this gift and thinks that he can help her find the bomb.The beginning of the movie has a scene where Cris is evading the FBI by using his gift to know where they are looking, or rather not looking, so as to move at the correct instant. It was a nice hook into the movie and kept me interested. There's also a great chase scene down a hill that grabs the view, and other nice sequence near the end where Cris again uses his gift. Those were definitely pluses.The romance building scene between Cris and Liz was awkward and unrealistic. Yeah, I know that's not the point, and it's just there to give a Hollywood semi-plausible scenario on how the two fall in love, but still, awkward. As for the twist ending, yeah, a disappointing cop-out, but some may enjoy it for what it is and disagree with that opinion.Bottom line, I enjoyed the movie. I was hooked at the beginning, got a bit bored as they developed the relationship, but enjoyed the last parts where things started to pick up. It was a pleasant surprise.

The direction is poor with nothing exciting and no sense of urgency or real pacing. The storyline is poor with unexplained plots and terrorists by numbers with the usual foreign accents (villains just can not be American. Yawn!!) Whose purpose is never really explained?

129,rawiri42,The quickest hour-and-a-half ever!,7,1 October 2014,"Next is different! Whether it is true Sci/Fi is, in my opinion, debatable. Oh yes, it IS paranormal. No doubt about that - and you find that out in the opening scene. Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) is a Las Vegas magician with a difference. He has a gift where he can see briefly into his future which, as any opportunist would do, he uses to his financial advantage, not only in his stage act but also at the gambling tables. But Cris is also sensible. Whilst he could use his gift to make millions - very briefly - he just makes enough to do what he wants to do in life without drawing attention to himself as he would if he consistently relieved the house of large sums of money. Following an unfortunate incident at the casino where Cris is mistaken for a petty robber and, on viewing the CCTV coverage of the incident, FBI agent Callie Ferris realises his gift and tries to recruit him to help in stopping an international terrorist gang that is threatening to explode a stolen Soviet nuclear bomb in Los Angeles, putting 8 million people's lives at stake. Ferris (Julianne Moore) thinks (somewhat mistakenly) that Cris can help find out where and when the terrorists are going to act before it happens but, knowing his own limits, Cris wants nothing of it until circumstances leave him with no alternative.And then the movie ends! P.S. It's what happens to change Cris' mind that makes this a movie well worth watching! And that's what makes it a refreshingly different and surprising story.",Next
130,simonparker1990,"Predictable, but Entertaining",8,2 May 2007,"Nicholas Cage is really starting to lose his dignity in movies, he's now the actor who is unfortunately associated with mediocre movies, not excruciatingly awful ones, but movies that aren't memorable and usually flop (with the exception of Ghost Rider which took way too much money in). So far he has had National Treasure, The Wicker Man, World Trade Center and of course, the movie I really despise the most, Ghost Rider. National Treasure was good fun but not a good movie at all. The Wicker Man had its moments, but was generally a bad movie, World Trade Center just never felt very good for me and Ghost Rider is one of my least favourite comic book movies of all time, yes it sits in league with Batman and Robin. So my expectations for Next were very low, I was expecting an average sci-fi flick and nothing more. So what a pleasant surprise to find a movie, that while predictable, dumb and featuring a pretty bad script, was still a great roller-coaster ride and one I actually really enjoyed watching. Its storyline is predictable, and the end twist so obvious from the start that when it arrives you feel a bit let down. However, the movie works because its so entertaining, the beginning in Las Vegas especially surprised me as I really did enjoy the sequence. Later I was even more surprised as the action sequences seemed to get even more impressive, despite the fact the CGI looks excruciatingly awful, a scene where stuff rolls down a hill made me cringe. Still, all in all its a movie worth watching, but brain cell have to be switched off immediately.So lets talk about the acting. Let me first say I'm not a Nicholas Cage fan, really I think he's a very bad and very overrated actor. However his enthusiasm in bad movies recently has made me sort of admire him. He was the one beacon of light really in Ghost Rider. Here my respect for him has grown, he knows the movie he is in isn't all that good, yet he seems to be having a blast doing the film. Its his enthusiasm that is really infectious and I couldn't help but like his character so much. He's got some good comedy moments thrown in occasionally, and the scenes where he looks into the future are usually well done. Julianne Moore basically does a repeat performance of her version of Clarice Starling in Hannibal. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as she delivers a good performance, its a shame then that her character seems very wasted at times. Jessica Biel definitely has the least material to work with out of the leads, in fact I'm still not certain actually why her character existed in the movie. Still she does a passable performance in the film, but she is nowhere near as good as she was in The Illusionist. Its the main villains however who come off with the least respect, not a single one is worth mentioning so I'm not even going to make the effort.The action sequences of Next are pretty well done, if you take out the dodgy special effects you're left with some pretty darn thrilling stuff. As I've said the Las Vegas opening really worked for me, it isn't really an action sequence, but the clever escape sequence is very well shot. The later action sequences are even more impressive, the cars and logs rolling down a hill is brilliant despite the horrible CGI, and a later scene where Cage looks into various futures when looking in a warehouse is really thrilling. These action sequences really grab your attention, and for a movie with poor CGI and a bad script its really nice to see it still achieve something so brilliant.So the final thing to talk about is the storyline, well the storyline for the most part is pretty good. Its easy to see where its all going, but the movie seems to have a good time getting there. In fact at times the seeing into the future does have original touches and they are good stuff to watch. The different versions of Cage introducing himself to Biel is a well thought out sequence and is very funny as well. The future aspect blends very well into the action sequences as well, especially later, more Matrix inspired sequences.Overall Next is a big dumb action movie, had it have not been released in April I'd have said it was a Summer Blockbuster style movie. Its fast paced, its got great action sequences, and its an ultimate guilty pleasure. It won't win awards, it won't be respected by the critics, but its a movie that crowds should enjoy.",Next

They should have cast age appropriately, as Nicholas just felt like a creepy guy. The script was cringy too, which didn't help.
2. The pacing is a bit off. So it would alternate between slow & fast scenes. (And the slow scenes were a a bit boring.)
3. A lot of things would happen that were illogical or didn't make sense.

To be fair, this movie is mediocre for the most part. The kind of flick you watch on streaming and might say ""Meh, that was okay."" - if you stop it a few minutes before the credits roll. That's the problem here, the ending pretty much a slap in the face to the viewers. Lazy writing is the theme here, I get the feeling that the writers took a single premise from the original short story, tossed the rest and said ""If he sees the future we can pad the film's run time by rehashing scenes over and over, then at the end we'll show that half the movie was just a premonition and not resolve anything!"" It feels like the writers did a first draft then gave up and handed it in because why bother exerting the effort to make a good film when you can make a crappy one and get paid the same?

Granted, there are some plot holes and some motivations are suspect, but overall it tends to entertain and keep you going more often than not.Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson, a man who can see two minutes into the future and predict what will happen. The problem is that the future constantly shifts and every action will change the next future. The fact that he can only see up to 2 minutes ahead also limits him somewhat. It does however help greatly in his magic career as a Las Vegas showman. It also helps when playing small time gambling. Unfortunately, it has gotten the attention of the FBI who want Cris to help them stop a Russia nuclear bomb from being detonated on American soil.As I said, there's a lot of backtracking in the story, which may serve to confuse some but is really important to the storyline. Cage turns in a great performance as the slightly eccentric seeming Cris. Julianne Moore is fine as a hard nosed FBI agent and Jessica Biel does all she can with a somewhat thankless role as the love interest.Overall, I really enjoyed Next.

135,sinncross,You won't predict this...,7,2 June 2007,"Working as a Vegas showroom magician, Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) has the ability to see two minutes into his own future. His shows does not give him adequate financial support, so he uses a casino to increase his income to a reasonable amount so he does not come under suspicion for excessive winning. However his life takes an unexpected turn when government agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) wishes to use his ability to help the FBI to stop a terrorist group from setting off a nuclear device within Los Angeles.Next is an altered adaptation of the novel The Golden Man by Philip K. Dick, but it's story works well in its own right. Featuring an acceptable pace, Next never lingers on but as well never accelerates when it is expected to from particular scenes. These scenes go to lose a certain edge about them, but this all-rounded element does however keep the film levelled and thus helps the viewer to become relaxed into the film's context. For a science fiction, Next goes about it's story with a very realistic approach creating a realistic scenario for the protagonist, Cris, to sort out. His ability is in itself not entirely implausible and is the main characteristic to all events which are portrayed. Being able to see his own future allows Cris to play out a scenario, and then act it out afterward how it deems fit, and at times brings about some humorous results. This is a neat approach to some of the scenes, and thankfully the director, Lee Tamahori, never goes about overdoing the effect, instead filming Cris's ability in different ways, an example being how Cris is able to ascertain various scenarios at once by showing us various Cris's walking around a building complex. Sadly this also brings about doubt as at times it's difficult to know whether a scene is really happening or whether Cris is instead playing it out first only to redo the scene again. It's not particularly distracting and perhaps helps in forcing one to keep thinking while watching, but the film is not complex in any manner. If anything, the film's ending will come across a shock, but it's debatable whether it's a good or bad shock.The film does sport great acting on Cage's part, who appears natural with his character, and how his character reacts with his own ability in varying situations. He is aided by Jessica Biel (Liz), who while not noteworthy in her acting, proves decent enough as Cris's love interest and there is definite chemistry between the two which is a bonus. Sadly, it is Moore who brings down the rest of the cast. Her portrayal as an independent and strong-willed woman is stale at times, and she comes across as rather bored with her role. This is particularly strange, when her movements of her character is so natural for her personality.The film's weakest aspect is it's CG. There are three scenes in which CG is used and each scene looks incredibly unreal and is rather distracting. However the cinematography is amazing and very engaged within the action.Besides a darkened view of a pornographic magazine, the film contains no nudity, no sex. It does include some minor language and violence, which involves firearms. The last arc of the film contains a long filmed gunfight between the terrorists and FBI, which a high number of deaths.Next never tries to be spontaneous with its scenes, supplying a well-rounded experience with some spectacular cinematography. The acting is on the good side but does contain a flaw with Moore, and the low-budget CG effect is unflattering. Not the best thriller ever, but it is still a worthwhile experience.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",Next

It wasn't great, but it was a relief from the Gerber baby food Hollywood has been pumping out for the last couple years.Cage plays Cris Johnson, a nightclub magician who possesses the gift of seeing into his future... limited to two minutes, to be exact. He has been flying under the radar to avoid suspicion as he uses his clairvoyance to maintain his finances at the Vegas blackjack tables and slots. FBI Agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is hellbent on bringing his comfortable existence to an end however. Terrorists have smuggled a nuke into the U.S., and Ferris needs Johnson to use his abilities to help her prevent the death of millions. Johnson isn't too keen on this idea, though, as he has a new love interest he has been pursuing.

The SFX are also a notch above the now-all-too-common CGI stuff we have become accustom to seeing on the big screen.There are some let-downs, however. For one, the whole nuclear bomb threat along with a severely ambiguous terrorist plot began to border on the ridiculous. Moore attempting to ensnare Cage was far more exciting. There was, of course, the typical chaotic gun play towards the end which almost ruined the film, had it not been for some very cool futurekill and plot turns.The potential of this film's ideas extend far beyond the obvious budget constraints placed on the film makers, and that's a pity, because this film could have easily gone from good to great.

138,the_Poppuns,Blech,3,28 April 2007,"Okay I like Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, and Thomas Kretschmann so seeing this movie made me sad. It's just so, I dunno, silly. First off, there is no chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Jessica Biel. I don't actually remember seeing in her in another film so at first glance she doesn't seem like a very good actress. But I'm going to go ahead and say that I'm guessing the actors weren't given a lot of direction because even Julianne was off. Nic Cage somehow was still okay. Thomas Kretschmann had approximately 10 words in the movie.(total spoilers) Onto the plot, which you will find makes no sense, Cage can see two minutes into the future. Because of this the government wants to help him with some terrorists(?). Terrorists who have a buh (no, not a buh, a bomb). Why do they have the bomb? I don't know. Where are these terrorists from? I don't know. What are their demands? They don't have any? I did go to the bathroom for a couple minutes but I asked the person I was with if any of that was made clear while I was gone and they said no. So some bad dudes have a bad thing and Nicolas Cage, who has stolen Tom Hanks' DaVinci Code hair, must save the day. But he doesn't feel like it. Why? I don't know. He seems to think he can't do it. And that's enough for him to run away from whatever agency Julianne Moore works for and let innocent people blow up. Whatever. So apparently for some reason these terrorists(?) steal the girlfriend he just got yesterday and decide to blow her up which he can see because magically where she's concerned he can see much further into the future. Now here's where I decided this was a 3/10. Julianne and Nic are chit-chatting and he suddenly decides to help now that his girlfriend is gonna get blowed up, which they show in all it's hilarity. In order for them to take the heat off they pretend he is shot so that a sniper will call headquarters and tell them he's dead. So before this happens with one phone call Julianne Moore shuts down all the phone service in the area so the sniper can't do that. Now Nic sees in the future and his girlfriend is going to blow up via explosive vest with a cell phone trigger. Where is the jeopardy if 5 minutes ago they showed us how easy it is for JM to shut off all the phone service in the area? And that's almost the end of the movie until an even better twist.I hate to give such bad reviews but this one is a real stinker.

Dick' readers, the action movies fans, and the Nicolas Cage Afficionados). I went to see it because I belong to this 3 categories. But is it worth seeing if you belong to only one of this category, or would you regret it 'till the end of your life ?1) You're a Philip K. Dick reader: and you're pleased to see that your favorite writer is at last respected by Hollywood, that produced this last years two good adaptations : ""Minority Report"" and especially ""A Scanner Darkly"". Helas, this movie looks more like ""Paycheck"" (the worst John Woo ever) than like a faithful adaptation. From K. Dick, nothings really stays beside the plot, that merely reminds me the story of ""The Golden Man"". Frank Cadiliac is able to see two minutes in his own future. But that's about it. K. Dick is just a bankable name to bring you to the theater, but the movie will hardly satisfy you, for its quite far from the universe of the writer of ""Ubik"".2) You like action movie : and the name of Lee Tamahori as a director intrigued you, for he just directed ""xXx2"", that was a big actioner picture and ""Die another day"", that is a James Bond really full of action. So, you tell yourself with a big smile that this movie will be full of incredible shotguns, non stop explosions, spectacular visual effects and brutal fighting. And, there is nothing of that in the movie : there's just people running during 2 hours ! The story is nonexistent : Julianne Moore chasing Nicolas Cage, who's supposedly the only one able to stop a bunch of improbable European (French, German and Russian!!!) terrorists. And there are just chasing and running, and, because the characters are tired spending their time running, they also rest a lot : see, there's no time for action here.3) You think Nicolas Cage is a good actor : and you're thinking with nostalgia to a time when he was playing for Coen, Woo, Scorsese, DePalma or Lynch. Then, you also think that he recently played in ""Ghost Rider"", ""The wicker man"" or ""National treasure"", and that this movies were bad, but that he was also bad in it, with an unique expression on his face and a ridiculous wig on his head. So you're not a Nicolas Cage's fan anymore, and, since Jessica Biel and Julianne Moore are inexistent in this movie, you have no reason to see it for the actors.

It started really silly with a character that does the most stupid choices, even though he can see into the future.It becomes a bit better after that, though, and the film has some interesting scenes. Some are really neat to watch, and cleverly made. Some are just stupid, embarrassing and some are plain boring. The film is very uneven, very sloppy.The acting is mixed, as the rest of the film. It seems like someone took three different film crews, made a lot of scenes each and then edited it together - only bad thing with that is that one of these teams are great and the other two sucks. You get an end product that is a mish mash of corny high-school film and splendid movie. Very strange feeling.The films script seems to not follow conventional standards either. The third act is not ""enough"" and when the film ended I was surprised, but in the wrong way. I had hoped for one more hour film, actually, which is also strange since the film is so bad in some moments.NEXT has its moments though, and these moments tend to shine bright enough to make it deserve a 6 out of 10.

141,muons,A cheesy entertainment with a letdown finale,5,21 July 2018,"A clairvoyant Las Vegas magician is tracked down by an FBI agent who believes his supernatural powers and wants to use them to foil an nuclear terrorist attack in LA. The weirdness and absurdity start with this brief definition of the scenario: a nuclear attack is imminent and instead of narrowing down on the threat with all of its resources, FBI spares a good deal of his task force to go after a person whose contribution to the solution is uncertain. The magician knows FBI looks for him for help to save the lives of some 8 million people, but tries to evade them for some reason which is not clear. If this doesn't sound weird enough the bad guys also go after the magician just because FBI looks for him but without really knowing why they need to. Indeed, the plot gives no clue for what the bad guys are up to, which depicts them all as cartoonish villains. Then, Jessica Beal joins in as the beautiful face of a romantic subplot which really doesn't add much to the story. J. Beal is gorgeous to watch but way too young and fresh to make us believe that she can't do better than a middle age man with a cheaply died, scruffy and thinning hair. A movie, especially one with some flavor of metaphysics and fantasy is for entertainment purposes and cannot be expected to follow the reality. However, the plot has to be coherent even in a fantasy world to sustain the attention of the audience. Nothing makes sense in this mess of a story. The action scenes are pretty typical with a cat and mouse game inside a warehouse, guns spitting fire in dust and smoke, dead people falling off rooftops and stairs, etc. Others involving a car, rocks, debris and logs tumbling down from hilltops look nothing more than a cheap, blatant computer animation even to an untrained eye. The pace is good but the flat and unconvincing acting matches well to the ludicrous plot and the ending is utterly childish and lame.",Next
142,FlorisV,"This is not a film, it's a con",1,7 June 2007,"Dear Script writer, what an awful script you wrote. Philip K Dick should turn in his grave and curse you from the beyond. A chump like you should never write a script again. I will call you Script Kiddie from now on. This name is normally saved for wannabe hackers, but since your writing is so obviously and extremely immature I thought it would suit you well. The movie doesn't have to be the book, but this...is a total mess.What bothered me in the first half was how easily Jessica Biel could be persuaded in taking along a total stranger in her car, even let him sleep at his house and what not. And Cage, despite not doing anything to remotely deserve her trust or to get to know each other, sleeps with her practically the same night. Dear Script Kiddie, if you want to put a love interest in your pitiful story, do it right. Study humans and their social interaction, you may learn something.Another thing that bothered me is how Julianne Moore is supposed to make the government look like the bad guys first. It may have worked if Script Kiddie would have done that in a convincing way. Philip K Dick knew how to inject paranoia into his characters in a believable way, but obviously Script Kiddie does not have the slightest clue about psychology. Why does Cage in the film refuse to save 8 million people at first? Moore just wanted to prevent a disaster.Script Kiddie could have skipped the whole part where Moore has to chase Cage because he refused to help and stick to the real plot. Apparently being about a nuclear bomb about to kill 8 million people (very original) for reasons which are never explained (some plot...). The Cage character, despite getting plenty of screen time, remains utterly flat. The film is a disgrace to an equally fine actor like Kretschmann as well, he gets so little screen time that he cannot even display personality or explain his bad guy motives.So we've got a very shallow film here. Let's add zero suspense and atmosphere while where at it. But hey this is an action film right? Well, yeah it is, one where you know all the important characters will always be safe because Cage knows what dangers are coming up. It felt like watching a video game in which you can finish out a level on automatic pilot because you've already completed it before.Last but not least the ending made me feel like I was conned. You can call it a lot, but not an ending. I'm glad I didn't pay for this film, long live BitTorrents...",Next

Even if one accepts the premise of the movie (that someone has the gift to see two minutes into the future) almost everything that happens in the film is too unbelievable! This is one of those films where the computer becomes the all powerful ""Magic Bullet."" Anytime there is a problem or an obstacle they just turn to some computer to help them out. Also, this film also requires the FBI to be so powerful that they can control everything in the United States (e.g., when the FBI needed all cellular telephone transmissions to be shut down in a specific radius in downtown Los Angeles within a few minutes---NO PROBLEM!!)Besides the unbelievable story, the performances of the two lead stars were uninspired.

145,mary-179-677383,This movie is A grade,9,2 July 2021,"I'm writing this review in 2021. So as you know I've watched a lot of poor quality movies. Netflix produces a lot of rubbish and I feel the standard of movies seems overall lower in 2021. This movie is perfect and it should be more highly regarded, it has special effects but not enough that it's the focus of the film. It has an interesting original plot. I give it a solid 9 only bc to get a 10 I need a little more closure at the end. I like to see the happy ending.First thing I want to point out directed at the poor reviews.1) he doesn't rewind time. He sees into the future. There is no paradox because of this. Example at the coffee shop before he met the Jessica's Biels character. He saw in the future based on hitting the guy. She wasn't impressed so he imagined the future if he did something else. At no point was he rewinding time. He was foreseeing the future and it was changing depending on what he thought.2) He could only see 2 mins in the future. But he saw Jessica biel (the one) for a long time before. Hence why he kept going back to the coffee shop
3) Once he slept with her, he saw the events that would happen. Seeing the future play out. The ending is open but it's implied that Jessica biels character is saved all the trauma and ordeal of being kidnapped by him voluntarily going with the FBI agent to try and save the country from the nuclear bomb. If the happy ended was shown I would give it a 10. But it's open ending you just have to assume he foresees in time and learns from his mistake.4) it was action packed and super enjoyable. The movie keeps you entertained the whole way through and I wasn't tempted to go on my phone during the whole movie.5) Not liking a hair style is not a reason to give this movie a low ranking.Give this movie a go.",Next

Well, that's the premise of this time-warping mess!Cage is a more tamed actor in this, abeded ably by Biel and Moore: one damsel in distress while the other a boss to cops that takes no crap!Speaking of Casinos, it starts in Las Vegas and takes us to some breathtaking views of the Grand Canyon, while we follow this mutant hero in search of his ""One"" and a nuclear bomb, while dodging bullets and responsibility, for the most part.How he can live a normal life with a constant case of dejà vü is beyond me! To make matters even more nonsensical seeing his future alone changes it, so it really shouldn't be worth seeing! And yet, even though Frank Cadillac tells us this various times, it doesn't change that much that he can't make a magic show out of it, nor win a few hands of blackjack!Maybe it's a curse, but one where a 40-something gets to bed a 20-something hottie by just magically transforming a paper stick to a rose! Unfathomable events come to a crescendo, one after the other, at it's improbable finale, or one of them.

Then again, ""Outer Limits"" is free on TV. I saw ""Next"" at a matinée show this afternoon; I wouldn't want to have shelled out $10 for it.The reviews I've read here so far seem to have had some pretty high expectations for ""Next""; I can't help but think that the low ratings reflect more their disappointment than the actual quality of the movie. With a concept by Phillip K. Dick, and starring Nicholas Cage and Julianne Moore (plus Jessica Biel for decoration) it had the potential to be an excellent film; it certainly is not excellent, but neither is it as bad as some are saying.True, the CGI effects are not state-of-the-art, but they are serviceable, and do not greatly detract from the story unless the viewer is looking for reasons to be annoyed. Yes, there were some plot holes, but one must suspend disbelief even for the basic premise, that of two-minute precognition. And I confess that I too suspected the twist ending ahead of time (maybe I'm psychic, too!) But still, it was OK, if only OK.The best thing that could have been said about ""Ghost Rider"" is that it set the bar pretty low for whatever film Nicholas Cage would be in afterwards. ""Next"" cleared that bar, but not by a lot. It's a shame that a star as fun to watch as Cage has turned up in yet another film that lands with a thud. It will pay his bills for a while, but he can do better, and should wait until better comes along.",Next

The character he plays can see the future - two minutes ahead at a time. I, on the other hand, as the movie began, had a clean, crisp vision of its end, 96 minutes into the future. Forty-eight times better than old Nick - how cool is that? Director Lee Tamahori - who went from the gritty Maori drama ""Once Were Warriors"" to a ""Sopranos"" episode and the next-to-last James Bond flick - has an ACTION movie here, with a cartoonish, cockamamy story. The problem is not with Cage's gift/affliction, although it's strange that he can play a whole reel of alternative futures in his head in seconds. What makes ""Next"" stupid is that both the bad guys (smuggling a nuclear device into L.A.) and the good guys (a whole bunch of James Bonds characters posing as the FBI) have no earthly reality to them.Everybody at all times pops up at the right time and right place, complete with mighty armies and arsenals - all to be rendered useless, of course, by good-looking old Nick. From Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon to LA, the scenery is spectacular, as is the instant movement of the forces of good and evil.So, if you don't mind spending an evening watching Saturday morning cartoons mushed into a ""live-action feature,"" this Bud is for you. You will also enjoy watching the ever-prettier and better-acting edition of Jessica Biel as the heartthrob, and the ever-angular Julianne Moore as the impatient FBI super-agent. John Edgar Hoover might have looked better but he never acted as imperiously as she does.And now, take a moment to evaluate your own prognostication potential: even if you plan to see ""Next"" weeks from now, can you predict how it will end? Clear space on the mantle for that Oscar coming to you. And don't worry about Cage: he has four movies in production and three lined up after that.By the way, Philip K.

152,MuggySphere,I loved it. Why Didn't I hear About This Film Till Now?,6,16 August 2008,"This is a bit of a gem as far as I'm concerned. I never heard about it till I traweled my favourite DVD store online and found it there. I had to go into town to pick up another DVD I had ordered so instead of getting Next online I picked it up with the other one I had collected. More of that one later.Next is the story of a man played by Nicolas Cage (a very underrated actor IMHO) called Cris Johnson. He is a performer in Las Vegas with a minor stage act as a kind of mentalist. He can predict things in the future. The gag with this, however is that what he can do isn't a stage act. He has the ability to see 2 minutes into the future, or thereabouts. But he keeps the talent kind of low key so that he for the most part stays under the radar with people. But on the night the movie starts he is playing at a casino and winning at cards. This action makes the security people upstairs who are watching him suspicious. They think he is cheating in some way and want to grab him for some questioning. But because he is now aware of them he rather deftly evades capture by stealing a car in an elaborate cat and mouse game of evasion. The movie then switches to the office of one Callie Ferris played by the lovely Julianne Moore who is an FBI agent also tipped off about Nic Cage's character. She's been watching his show and is also suspicious. But suspicious in that his abilities must be somehow real. She tries to recruit him to helping her find some terrorists of European origin who have brought a nuclear weapon into the city of LA and plan to blow that up. Cris for his part doesn't want any part of this because as a child he underwent examination after examination about his gift and thus wishes to keep his low profile life. He has regular habits. He always visits this coffee shop at the same time every day because he has seen a vision of a girl that will come there. True enough that girl does come and is played by the lovely Jessica Biel. He wants to get out of the area so after some drama with her and a mad suitor of hers he gains her sympathy, after the suitor decks him..Thus they embark on our adventure and we have both the FBI and now the terrorists after this guy. I won't say any more because the movie picks up from the point after they leave the coffee shop and things start moving at a good pace. The ending left me gasping because I thought I was watching one set of events, but it all tied together very well as far as I'm concerned.",Next
153,jtwcosmos,Next (2007),1,6 June 2011,"""I blame the writers."" No, this is not an actual quote, but it fits.This is the story of a man who can see into the future for two minutes, which brings him nothing but trouble. And it could have been the start of a very good movie, but when two thirds of all reviewers say they hated it... you don't have to see the future to know it stinks. It stinks so bad that I'm afraid I'm not smart enough to make fun of it properly. But I'll try.The movie starts well enough. We get to see a bit of Las Vegas while following Mr. Cage around, we get to witness the excitement and the adventure and we get to see how it is to know everything before it happens. Which is great. The action is fast paced, it is fun, it is great.But then... the script runs out of ideas and gets all kinds of stupid. And because we are bored stiff, we start to notice things. First, there is Mr. Cage's haircut. Is that his? Or is it something Mr. Jim Carrey would make fun of? ""Is that your hair? Or is it road kill? Did you shoot it yourself or just run it over with your car? I don't know if I should laugh, cry or take a shovel and bury it."" And so on.Then is the love story. Couldn't they just pretend she was his girlfriend from the beginning, and spare us half an hour of bad romance? ""Hey honey, good to see you. I know a great place in the Canyon. Lets go to out there and shag."" Much easier! But nooo. They had to make Miss Biel look like a blonde bimbo and come out from the shower naked, in front of a total stranger. I don't know many women who do that but... if they exist... can I please please meet one?And then the action gets going, and we can just go with it. Yes, there is bad CG, bag dialog, bad acting and bad directing all around, but it is entertaining enough to not care too much about it. Like before the action sequences, for example. I'm sure Mrs. Moore went to the director and said: ""Hey, you know, I think I should go train with some real FBI people for a while, see how they do it, you know, see the real thing..."" But then the director said: ""Nooo, there's no need to do that... Just remember: everybody calls them Flat Foot."" And she walked like a duck for the rest of the movie.And then there is the ending. If you want to take my advice, set your alarm to go off precisely 1 hour and 22 minutes into the movie. Then get up and leave. Don't look back, just leave. You will feel much better and you will not feel the urge to come back here and write a bad review yourself.Next. I generally like Mr. Cage and Mrs. Moore, but this was terrible. 1/10.",Next
154,john in missouri,I LIKE it... Now THAT was a good movie!,8,27 April 2007,"Nicholas Cage and Jennifer Biel star in this Philip-K-Dick-inspired thriller about a man who can see a small distance into the future.If you could see even two minutes ahead of the present, what abilities would that give you? What could you avoid? What could you change? Like most of the PKD-short-story inspired movies, the writers and director have taken great liberty (as they've often had to) in order to bring the core ideas of a 10 or 15-page story to the big screen.When I saw the trailer and especially when I saw it was PKD-related, I was immediately interested, as Philip Dick was an author who saw far into the future. Many of his stories from as far back as the 1950s are only now being brought to the masses.Honestly I was almost put off of going to see NEXT by the early negative reviews posted here. Not every film based on this author has been well done. The prime example: I'd still like to tar and feather the director who so brutally butchered ""Total Recall."" But in this case, don't believe a word from the nay-sayers. Yes, I'll grant you, this movie is =different=. That's okay. You have to appreciate it for what it is, and what it is, is good.When I saw that the voters at large were reviewing this movie around a ""6"" I decided to go anyway as that seemed considerably better than the reviews I was reading. I was pleasantly surprised. Personally, I give it an ""8."" One or two of the early reviewers complained about plot holes. No, in fact not. Any apparent plot hole(s) that I saw collapse when you look at them just a little bit closer.It's well known that ordinary people can do extraordinary things -- like lift a car -- when the life of someone they love is at stake. That being the case, why shouldn't Chris be able to see into the future better when the stakes are higher? Let's look at another possible plot hole. If you could see two minutes into the future, why make your living as a magician? Why not just wait for a $100 million dollar lottery jackpot, place one small bet two minutes before the drawing, and be set up for life? Sorry, doesn't work that way. The lotteries cut off sales one to two hours before the numbers are drawn.Likewise, horse race betting closes several minutes before the race begins, outside of Chris Johnson's time window. Dog races might afford an opportunity, but these are more obscure and Johnson might not be aware of any such opportunity. Anyway, being able to combine magic with the occasional bet gives him decent cover.And men, if you're still skeptical, well, consider this: the sight of Jennifer Biel wrapped in a bed sheet is already pretty much worth the cost of admission. :-)",Next

Finally, the ending (maybe we were supposed to satisfied by then) seemed to fizzle out on itself like a spent firework. Nicholas Cage is so often wooden yet faintly likable that I can watch him without irritation but Jessica Biel - at least the character she was given - was so much the one-dimensional eye-candy token gesture that I kept wishing she'd slip into the past and stay there.Unfortunately once you weed out the clichés - tough female FBI agent, lissome but polystyrene young female lead who has a scene with a group of children to prove she is really a real person, hero with a past, etc etc you end up with not much of anything except suspension of disbelief which is only going to take you so far - usually to the closing credits, and I cant even really remember what it all ended up being about...Watch it so you can say you saw it.",Next

Actually the whole story line just did not make sense, even if the story was nice, the execution was not that great at all.

However, by the second third of the film things start to unravel as what starting off as a brilliant premise quickly evolves (or dissolves) into a run of the mill thriller, with not much happening and whole lot of talking. By the third act the film really does sink, as although the stakes are raised in the action department much of the initial thrill felt in the first 30 minutes has all but evaporated as the film gets weighted in cheesy dialogue and poor plotting, resulting in a Luke warm ending with some substandard and barely watchable shoot outs. So, to conclude I would have loved to give this film 6/10 (3*), but it really goes to pieces by the end, and when it comes to films I view the last impression as being the most important, not the the first, and so it gets marked down considerably, because of what I have said was a very promising start ending in a not so promising way.

158,cardinalbunal,sleight of hand.,8,20 July 2007,"I approached this movie with much trepidation and reservations. But it turns out it has the promise I thought it would have and also its downfalls that I was apprehensive about. Firstly, this is one of the best paced action/sci fi movies seen recently. And I think I'll add it to my book of favorite Philip K. Dick adaptations. MINORITY REPORT being my favorite. I also liked IMPOSTOR, anyway, what's refreshing is to see the strength and optimism of Cage's character. Sure being a martyr or an underdog has its appeal to all of us, but the quick-mindedness, clairvoyance and decisiveness of this film's hero is one of it's plusses.One of my gripes is Jessica Biel's extremely wooden acting, and it will probably make it in my top 3 worst performances in a motion picture ever. The plot and formula of the feds enlisting the aid of Mr. Every-Day-Guy is indeed tired, but as a magician myself I was also very pleased to see the downplayed, but fairly discernible theme of charlatans pretending to be real magicians, and real magicians who do have that extra ounce of psychic power besides there chicanery; but ultimately disclaim it. The magic/perfforming artist aspect was very well integrated into the plot, though I found some moments where he had to use sleight of hand and pop-philosophical poetry to woo Jessica Biel.All in all, the story moves forward as it should, pacing properly handled, what happens NEXT... doesn't always follow.

No attempt is even made to provide plausible plot points. The special effects are routine and the acting is truly uninspired. Of the whole cast, I felt bad for Jessica Biel. Cage, Moore and even.....Peter Falk, can collect their paychecks and move on. Jessica is trying to start a career. She does alright looking bewildered, and that is all she's really asked to do.If film makers care this little about their craft, take down their names and don't let them do it again!!

161,CagedinSanity,A solid 6.,6,3 April 2008,"Bad: 1) I did not like how the movie suddenly wants him to see hours or days into the future. I thought the 2 minute limit was a splendid querk and I watched this movie hoping that he would save half the world with two minutes on his timer. It was a clever and decent limit put on the character.2) I did not understand How he was able to dodge 7 bullets (Or however many this movie decided to shove into the clip). Nick's character could only see the future, not move through it. Which he did.3) The movie is incomplete. It could use up another hour to explain things like motives, how he uses the power to his full advantage (Like the cast of Heroes are able to ""build upon"" their powers to make it stronger, much like he did to scan the factory).4) The European's motive was not explained. There wasn't even an effort to do so.5) The ""True-love"" thing seemed a little stupid. ""Hi. I can tell the future. Clearly, we should(will) have sex."" I personally think It would have been an interest twist if the love interest was the FBI agent.6) I HATED when the movie warped back to after Nick's character and Biel's make the lovings, that made the entire movie pretty much useless.7) Regardless of the 2 minute limit but 3 hour+days with Liz, the movie should have pressed on this more and given Liz a bigger role. I would have respected this movie more if the ""Love Interest"" plot was made more important when Liz realizes how important she really is to him.Good: 1) The café scene was very clever, him trying to win the lady's heart in some form or another. I got confused when she just said ""Please, don't"" to him, made me think she had some type of predictive power too, but instead that was just one of her reactions on her mental rolex. Thinking of that makes it make a little bit of sense.2) I liked the ""Jason Bourne"" Feel to the movie, how he was dodging people coming at him. I love those type of sequences in any movie. Dodgeing the FBI was unnecessary, but the character's logic DOES make sense when he states, ""I can't help them. I can only go two minutes and only if it directly effects my life"". This does make sense.Overall: The 2 minute limit was a good idea. They should have emphasized on saving the world within two minutes, THAT'S the definition of ""suspense.""The movie was incomplete.

His skills are noticed by an agent of the FBI (Julianne Moore) who wants to utilize his abilities to thwart terrorists who plan to set off a nuclear device in Los Angeles.I found the movie entertaining and suspenseful. There are a few sequences where the CGI looks kind of fake but overall I thought it was very good. It was well-acted and well-paced. I almost always like Nicolas Cage movies, and man oh man Jessica Biel looks absolutely smmmmmoking hot! I recommend it; I give it seven stars.",Next

You never see the twists coming very often in this movie and to be able to see your future and change it like that would be really cool for any of us. Julianne Moore and Jessica Biel were pretty good in this film too. I enjoyed it and it didn't bore me, but neither did the director's other two action films that I watched which were Die Another Day and XXX 2: State of the Union. I have heard some weird things about the director, but he knows how to make a good movie, thats all I know. Overall I give this a 7 out of 10 because it was pretty good but it wasn't perfect or anything. I would recommend it to sci-fi and thriller fans most definitely though.",Next

When you think about it he should be able to crack any code or answer any question even if he dont know the answer. He just ses what random noise gives the answer. Several times during the movie I though that he must have seen a better future in a different action that the one he just did. Like the time in the casino where he just clumsy pushed the robber, or in the attack at the end where he let several agents die where he must have been able to get them to survive. This thinking got me to not be able to fully enjoy the movie. Then we have the leader of the agency who is searching for the bomb who just happens to se his fancy work in the casino and instantly thinks that he can read the future and puts all resources into finding him because he ""definitely"" is the key to finding the bomb.

165,MovieKen,Just so-so,5,11 December 2007,"Every morning and evening, Cris Johnson has a martini sitting in the same chair at the same diner. He knows he will meet the woman of his dreams there at either 8:09am or 8:09pm, but not the day. Cris is also a magician who can see two minutes into the future. After watching his act, the FBI is convinced of his ability and they ask him to help them stop a nuclear terrorist attack.All things considered, this is a very mediocre film. The action is exciting, and the CGI is pretty good. The film's premise is interesting (what would you do if you could see 2 minutes into the future?), and the movie generates a lot of good questions. It's an enjoyable 96 minutes, and you could do worse than this movie if you just want to turn your brain off and waste your time.But on the other hand, the plot is very thin, and none of the characters have much depth. Aside from Nic Cage, every actor in the movie is just an extra. Julianne Moore has done better acting while asleep, and Peter Falk could have only been used less if he acted as a portrait hanging on Cris Johnson's wall. Jessica Biel is beautiful, but her character had almost nothing to do. Anyone could have played her part. Her only purpose in the film seems to have been to distract us from all of the movie's flaws. The dialog is awful in many places, and there are far too many stretches in logic for this film to be taken as seriously as it wants to be. The film is also short and it ends pretty abruptly.Having said that, I give this movie 5 stars out of ten. Three stars because Jessica Biel is nice to look at, and two stars because she's in the movie at least 35 minutes.* ****Spoilers start here. Stop reading if you don't want to read any spoilers.**** *For this movie to work, there needed to be a suspension of disbelief. Personally, I can accept a lot of outlandish things in movies, but there were several plot holes in Next that make it harder for me to just enjoy the story. There are just too many unanswered questions that distracted me from fully enjoying the film. A lot of people really liked the movie, but I'm not one of them.For one thing, why would the FBI be at all interested in Cris Johnson once they found out he can only see two minutes into the future? What good would a 2-minute head start be when you're chasing down a nuclear bomb? It's pointed out in the film that Cris can see farther into the future with Liz than by himself. Because this is only used once and because it is never explained why, this point seems to be little more than just a convenient plot device to be exploited later.I think the writers missed out on a great opportunity to give more depth to this movie. Imagine what could have happened in this movie if Cris and Liz both realize how important they are to each other because they can get so much more done together than when they're apart. What if the FBI knew this before Cris did? What if, in fact, the FBI actually used Liz to meet Cris and make his visions of the future more effective, so that they could more easily stop the terrorists? There are literally hundreds of ways this movie would be better if the writer had added just a little more depth to the plot.Speaking of the bad guys, who are they, and where are they from? I heard several different European accents among them, and I couldn't tell how they are connected or why they are together. Why would this particular group of Western Europeans want to detonate a nuclear bomb within the United States? I can only guess that they are working for someone else or they simply hate Americans. Maybe they stopped at a McDonald's in Paris and were offended by the French Fries. Who knows. Regardless, just a little more information on their background would have really helped add depth to an otherwise very shallow film.And what was the deal with Nic Cage's hair? At first, I thought it was just a bad wig that he used for his Vegas show. When he didn't take it off after the show, that's when I realized the makeup artists tried to make him look younger. I'm sorry, I was never fooled for a second. Cage was 18 when Biel was born, and coloring his hair to a random shade of brown didn't make the romance between the two of them any less icky. They really should have picked someone younger to play his part if they didn't want to gross everyone out. I actually think it would have been better if Julianne Moore and Biel had switched parts. At least the romance would have been more palatable.I have a lot of other unanswered questions about this film, but not all of them are that important to the storyline, so I'll ignore them. But small plot holes can be just as distracting as large ones. I'll just say that I wouldn't rate this movie above average. It's more fun than taking out the trash, but probably not more fun than waxing your car.",Next

169,Listen_to_the_Law,"Fun movie, bad ending",7,2 July 2007,"Next is a very nifty little movie. It's serious, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. In a way, it's like The Matrix sequels: full of cool action and a ridiculous story. Granted, the story is not Matrix-worthy (in the cool factor or in complexity), but it's worth the comparison.The main reason as to why Next doesn't take itself too seriously is because it stars Nicolas Cage. He's an actor who almost always plays a serious role, but adds his own quiet touch of humor to it. In Next, Cage is Cris Johnson, a man who is blessed with the power to see into the futurebut for only two minutes. Still, lots can be changed in that short time span, which is basically the whole premise of the movie. Next is a lot of fun, but it has its fair share of problems to deal with too.There are some problems with Johnson's power. In a Las Vegas casino at the beginning of the movie, Johnson evades every man trying to catch him after he knocked down a man. The high-ups watching this unfold on camera are dumbfounded. Smart, arrogant, and pervasive FBI agents quickly recognize his unusual power, and they want him to help them stop a nuclear accident that could wipe a large chunk of the earth off of the map. The FBI is headed up by Callie Ferris (Moore), a strict but laughable woman who is out of character for Moore. (To witness Julianne Moore in top form, watch Children of Men.) She leads the suddenly violent and ticked-off FBI after Johnson in the hope of catching him, but like many before her, Johnson can look into the future to change it. Thus, it becomes a nearly impossible task to catch him.In the meantime, Johnson develops an unnecessary love story with a blonde named Liz (played by Biel). Supposedly, the only time Johnson ever saw further ahead than two minutes into the future was when he met her. Their passion for one another is so strong that, when Callie eventually meets up with Liz and tells her that Cage is ""using her,"" Liz forgives him. All this leads to a overdone ending with a horrible, terrible twist at the end.Now I advise you to go into Next and just take it for what it is: a fun action movie. The story is an intelligent mess. The acting is okay to good, but nothing worthy of a reward. Nicolas Cage is a complete bad-ass walking across the screen through gunfire, and the same can be said for Moore running through traffic. The box office returns aren't impressive (a little over $7 million for it's opening weekend), but I advise you to watch this movie.Good) special effects, parts of the story, the FBI running down the streetsBad) logic-defying problems with the story, the love garbage (not as bad as Spider-man, though)Controversy) If Brandon Routh couldn't have done it, Nicolas Cage would've been the next Superman",Next

But eventually the security does wanna question him and he knows it- so what does he do? Prevents a robbery and then runs. Why? No-one knows. Like how would they prove he was cheating- now he really is a suspect. Anyways, he steals a car and commits even more felonies with his escape. Meanwhile a special agent (Moore) is after him too since she needs him to help them find some stolen nuclear weapons- but how did she hear about his powers and how can he help them since he can only see his own future within 2 min they don't quite explain. (later we see that it involves him strapped in a chair watching news and seeing the future through the news on TV).Oh yeah, Jessica Biel is in there too as his love interest- somehow his tricks and weird talk of soul-mates doesn't freak her out and they'r on a road trip and 2 days later making out- yeah right... At any rate, the FBI still wants him to help them but he refuses fearing he will be a lab rat. Then they try to get him by telling Jessica that he's a psycho and wanted by FBI. Still, she for another unexplainable reason tells him all and he confides in her as a poor soul. Hmmmm. Oh yeah, the 'bad guys' with the nukes are after him too cuz now they feel he is a threat for their operation. So as FBI captures Cage, the bad guys take the girl as a hostage.U can just sense the drama unfolding! Him not wanting to help the FBI catch the bad guys is just as irrational as most of the movie, including most of the special effects and the dialogue- unless by some weird chance that was their intent: to make a stupid movie.

Most of this stuff I would forgive if the story was innovative. I have seen low budget productions with bad acting, directing, etc. but utilizing a great script and I've walked away satisfied. The script in ""Next"", which is adapted from a short story by Philip K. Dick that I have not read (I'm a fan of PKD), does a terrible job in fleshing out Frank Cadillac (Nick Cage) a magician in Vegas. It actually does not flesh out anyone in the script including the bad guys who we never know why they want to blow up anything anyway. With no character development you're left with a concept but unfortunately the concept, a psychic who can only see two minutes forward in time must stop a nuclear warhead from being detonated, never tries to be innovative. I never cared for the characters, I wasn't intrigued by the plot, too many of its established rules keep getting broken throughout the film and no one seemed to care that they were in this film in the first place.

People could make a lot of superhero crap when they had such an extraordinary power to empower the hero with. Lee Tamahori has shown admirable restraint here. Probably everyone trying to watch this film already knows what it is about, so saying it again here is pointless. The plot it thought upon such a way that there are no dull moments in the film. Sometimes you have to watch on for the first hour to understand the action in the second. That soft of a film Next is not. The FBI in this film is pretty much like they are anywhere else. Less intelligent, less agile, less understanding than even common cine-goers (like me). Nicholas Cage did good acting here that he had not been doing for sometime now (since Lord of War).

Nobody falls in love that quickly, and shows affection and interaction as if they've known each other for a year or more.As for the main plot, there was one hole that I spotted, but overall, I found it very entertaining.

192,Rack-Focus,Been There; Done That,5,27 April 2007,"It's a shame the producer's of ""Next"" could not see into the future. If they could they might have created a better movie.Maybe they were too busy looking into the past, because we're seen almost everything in ""Next"" before and done better.Like ""Déjà Vu,"" (2006) ""Next"" centers around an effort by the Federal government to see through time to stop a terrorist attack. Unlike ""Déjà Vu,"" which allowed ATF agent Denzel Washington to look into the past, ""Next's"" FBI collaborator, Cris Johnson a/k/a Frank Cadillac (Nicholas Cage), can see into the future, albeit just two minutes ahead. In both movies, a woman plays a pivotal role in the remote visions.Cage plays the reluctant hero, basically reprising the good guy done wrong roles he had in ""Con Air"" (1997) and most recently in ""Ghost Rider"" (2007). His FBI handler, Julianne Moore, gives her Agent Callie Ferris the same tough cop treatment she gave Clarice Starling in ""Hannibel"" (2001) or if you swapped sides, she could be playing Julian Taylor in ""Children of Men"" (2006).The action sequences are derivative with the usual collection of car chases and shoot 'em ups. Cage's ability to see into the future does give him an almost super heroic ability to dodge bullets and other hazards, but that quickly grows tiring, because it is repeated in constant variants throughout the film.And finally, like a good M Night Shyamalan movie, ""Next"" builds up to a big plot twist at the end. Unlike Shymalan, ""Next"" fails to deliver. Its turn produced groans in the theater I was in.But ""Next's"" biggest failing is what it left out. The movie never answers the most basic question, why is Liz (Jessica Biel) able to affect Cris' ability? It's supposed the reason why he seeks her out and the idea just vanishes. Perhaps it was going to be answered in the next movie. But then, I can't see into the future.",Next

Nicolas cage, playing the role of the magician and Julianne Moore as an FBI agent doing their stuff beautifully as always and they were well supported by Jessica Biel and Thomas Kretschmann but is is the storyline and weak screenplay that wasted their efforts. that is exactly why this movie falls far behind ""Deja Vu"" which had only Denzial Washington but yet did well due to unpredictability well captured by screenplay.Ending was far away from predictable thats true but if you are wondering how it happened well u won't get any answers.",Next

I never bought Julianne Moore as an FBI agent. She can't pull off ""tough."" I also thought there was absolutely ZERO chemistry between Jessica Biel and Cage.

Sadly, the quality of these adaptations does not quite match up to the standard of the science fiction genius. Next - much like Paycheck - borrows a brilliant idea from Dick, then turns it into a below-par action-adventure flick. It has nothing that we haven't seen before, the characters are boring, the acting is uninspired and to top everything the CGI effects are simply poor. In this computer age you expect faultless special effects but in this case they are clearly visible, destroying the illusion that keeps movies alive. I wonder where the 70 mil budget went... As a PKD and science fiction fan it's frustrating to see another work of the master mishandled and I can only hope that not just Blade Runner will be the only movie that is able to show the depth every Dick story possesses.",Next

It is very entertaining and weird, with this continuous moving back and forth in time. You never really know if you are in the future or if the scene takes place in the present. Or if the film is the present and seeing two minutes ahead you decide to walk that path or to change it right before something happens to you. Interesting also, that she allows him to enhance his sight more into the future. The acting was OK, although anybody could have done any of the roles. Julianne Moore is not very convincing in her role and Jessica Biel has two lips, she better sues her esthetist. And any story would have done good. In this case a nuclear threat was chosen. But.. why would an international group do that? At the end they just light the bomb. So what? No explanation for that. But also the outcome of a scientific experiment, or something related to climate change could have been used. Does this movie pretend to scare citizens of California? Does this movie want to tell that also Europeans are the enemy?",Next

Sure, I know this was supposed to represent his being able to see ahead at least two minutes into the future, but it seemed to be rather over done. It was confusing, you think one thing is going to happen and you get in the mood of the scene, and it ends up being a premonition.The dialoge was OK, not creative, but hell, it's an action movie, not a drama comparative to Million Dollar Baby or anything. The use of the camera was amazing, especially the scene on the tanker at the end when he was searching the entire deck with his premonition.

He uses his 'skill' to be a magician and to beat casinos at blackjack. He is pursued by the FBI, who wants his help in tracking a group that is trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon into the USA. The group that is trying to smuggle it in is also after him, to silence him and whatever he might know. Along the way he meets Liz (Jessica Biel) who befriends him and they take off into the US Southwest.He is captured by the FBI and reluctantly agrees to help them, as the terrorists have kidnapped Liz, in an effort to draw him out. This leads him to Los Angeles, where radiological sensors indicate the bomb already is. The movie is full of interesting special effects and twists on how he uses his power to avoid getting killed or injured.Philip K. Dick has been the inspiration for many movies from big hits like Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report, to box office bombs like Screamers and Paycheck. His story, ""The Golden Man"" is the basis for Next.If you know what deus ex machina is, you'll know roughly how the ending goes. You'll also know how the ending works if you watched the TV show Dallas. I won't ruin the movie by telling you how it ends, but I left the theatre feeling ripped off, simply because the ending is exactly what writers are told NEVER to write.

203,MJBlazin,Not great but more going on in plot than many give it credit,5,28 April 2007,"Several important plot elements that many reviewers think minor, but make the ending in line with the movie's rules:Jessica Biel's character's real purpose, besides the towel scene, is to extend Cris Johnson's powers. Without her, he can't see far enough to have much impact. How he normally uses his 2 minute range doesn't really make sense until you see some of the special effects in the factory. He just doesn't view the future; he actually runs Monte Carlo type simulations against it with the weird effect that running the simulations alters the outcome. He just does not duck to avoid capture or a tumbling log. He really tries out various solutions very rapidly until he finds a good outcome. Then he moves on to the next problem. The magic show scene or the rock/salamander trick makes little sense unless he has this ability. He's never really a magician, even with seemingly simple tricks. He always uses his powers to make it seem he has sleight of hand skills. With the 2 minute range, he has to physically experience the next step before restarting the process. The Jessica Biel character gives him the power to extrapolate on one solution to a point further in time and repeat the process, over and over. Al Gore and friends do the same thing with their climate models.The ending is not consequently just pasted on. It does fit within the weird logic of the movie. Nic Cage, after being with Jessica, recognizes his reach has expanded and attempts to find a solution. After ""solving"" the problem, he then acts to implement it.",Next

206,KingAtor42,Underdeveloped Romance Packaged In A Frail Sci-Fi/Action Shell,4,6 January 2008,"It took me a while after actually watching this movie to figure out what it was and I came to the realization that it is nothing but a very, very, very bad romance. That's right, a romance. The only core to the film is Cage's character's obsession and relationship with Biels'. The rest about the foresight, the bomb, the FBI, and the action is all just details and poorly done ones at that. The entire film though is paper thin and full of trouble throughout every layer of its story.Starting with the romance, Biele falls for Cage with almost no hesitation. One minute they might and the next minute she's falling deeply for a very aged Cage with a terrible hairdo. You've got Moore chasing Cage most of the film, whose weak performance is like she resurrected her turn as Clarica Starling and injected it right into her Children of Men stint. She is dull, unconvincing, and she phoned in this role. Then you've got the entire 'big bomb will explode' subplot which only occasionally appears until it dominates the last third of the film. If there is a villain in the film, he was introduced so poorly no one notices.The worst part of the film is reserved for those who actually hope to see some nice science fiction. The movie never gives justification for why the terrorists are even concerned with Cage's character. All we know is they want him dead. We never know why Cage has abilities, only a passing comment mentions him being a lab rat as a child. Even worse is the way he magically grows extremely stronger in abilities as the film goes on, just because he wants to.If you're really desperate and need a film that is both short and has enough romance to trick your woman into seeing it and enough sci if to get your man to watch it, this works. Just don't expect plausible story lines or character reactions and definitely don't hope for characters you actually care about.",Next

You'd tell everyone ELSE that you can SEE two minutes into the future. But for YOU, what it FEELS like is a skip-back-2-minutes button on life, the universe and everything. This movie unfolds that point slowly, and competently, blending outsider to insider perspectives. That's the real storyline and it satisfies. OK I just spoiled the plot, but wait not really (inside joke). Watch for that issue to climax and I believe (hope) it'll be more satisfying.This is an original idea fleshed out thoughtfully with some pretty people doing it. That's the non-formula formula Hollywood should be practicing as if it were about to be eclipsed by YouTube anyway. I'll agree there are a few lines of dialog that seem hacked by high-schoolers. And the love story is weak on both sides, too devoted too fast. ""Wait, who are you again? Oh right, I guess I am completely in love with you too."" Minus two points. Still darn entertaining. Not artsy fartsy nuancy original, just a refreshingly new idea: how one simple ability would, in vicariously rich detail, transform a life, from little benefits (knowing what pickup lines will fail on a girl) to huge (saving the world). I normally hate abrupt endings, but not this time. This movie could have gone on and on and on for like forever because of the two minute rewind thing, and there was just no way out but quick, like a bandaid.And by the way Biel is such a cutie. Shallow, I know, but this movie is a nice buffet of little things: her exotic Euro-Choctaw face in its prime, lots of masterfully crafted details in dialog and setting, flashbacks satisfyingly filling in the cracks, even some cool special effects. Just how would *you* deal with a dozen trucks falling down the hill toward you AND a pretty FBI agent? Well, with the unlimited do-over thingy, you don't even need to look.

The viewers' reviews vary; I'll respond to some issues: 1.Yes, Nicholas Cage is one of my favourite actor - he is an inspiration: an adventurous hero with charisma, easy to sympathise with, he's always resourceful, coping with precarious situations in kind of gentle & soulful manner. I think it was ""City of Angels"" that triggered my admiration initially which has been carried on so far.2. Lots of negative comments are directed towards plot & the ending. Well, it didn't bother me at all and another possible good-ending is left for a viewer's imagination. Although this movie has been promoted as action thriller, it bears strong ""love-story"" undertone which quite logically translates into the way the movie ends and it left me personally thinking about repercussions of acting or inaction in the name of destiny.3. Of course, the movie is a fast-paced (intelligent) fantasy and all sorts of stuff would not happen like this in normal life. But I was coming to cinema accepting that Nicholas Cage can see the future as advertised in the trailer, so it would be absolutely pointless to ponder about not quite ""tight plot line"" and circumstances about who and how and why...Otherwise, quite an enjoyable ride!",Next

The film however did have good potential to twist and turn and finish on a high note. Instead it just rolled along, bouncing to an abrupt stop, without using the full potential of either Cage or Biel. At the end of the film you are left with the worst feeling that a film can give you, which is ""This isn't the ending, is it?...no...it can't be...there must be more.""

212,Nicol_Bolas,Deeply unfulfilling,3,17 August 2009,"This is not a well built action film. The action is lifeless at best. Indeed, the very premise of the movie seems to work against any hope of tension. The gimmick of the movie is that the main character can see 2 minutes into the future. So he can correct any mistake he might have made. Basically, he's unkillable: he's perfect in a fight and can't be shot with a gun.Be warned: the romantic subplot is so unconvincing that it may remove your belief in love altogether.The villains barely exist. Nothing about these guys work. They don't feel like effective threats (admittedly, not their fault), and they don't feel like they're smart enough to actually steal a nuke, let along smuggle it to shore. They leave a trail of bodies lying around; they make no effort to conceal *any* of the murders they commit.And the main plot is just stupid. Terrorists have a nuke somewhere in Los Angeles. And the *best* the FBI can do is hunt down try to find some guy that can see 2 minutes into the future? This is all they have? I guess if supernatural powers don't exist, we're screwed.The ending... Oh God. I don't think I've ever felt quite so betrayed by a movie's ending than this.Ridiculous things are not new to movies. There are many good movies that are based on nonsense. All we ask is *consistency*. When you make up rules for your nonsense, that your nonsense follows those rules.They can't even manage that here.

213,ReelVillain,You know what's coming,4,11 April 2013,"In a world where things are ordinary, one man is different. Cris Johnson can see into the future, but he can only see 2 minutes into the future, and only when it affects him. A selfish ability if ever I saw one.Next is a film of success and failure, it seems to spend far too much time killing time then doing anything of actual merit or distinction. I mean I LOVE the premise, I think it's clever, it's unique and it's awesome so why do I feel like the film is so mundane?If you are given a nugget of gold like the premise of Next then you need to do something special with it, Paycheque was like that, so was Minority Report, they were both given a nugget and pushed it around in ways that were fun, interesting and just a little bit inventive, but somehow Next misses the mark. Next's failures are probably all down to the one central conceit of the movie, the women.The female lead of the film is important because with her Cris can see further than 2 minutes, much, much further. That sounds like a fine outlay but it's in it's execution that the film starts to stumble, for much of the movie we see Cris on the run without any real sort of target or aim in life apart from to be with this girl.Also, if you are going to do the ""repeated sequence"" thing you can't have someone who is smug, and of all the things Nicolas Cage is one of them is most defiantly smug. It's like he knows the future and knows you don't, for most of the film he comes across as far too self-righteous, especially when compared to the man who most resembles this situation ""Phil Connors"".Don't get me wrong, Next is a fine little movie, it has some impressive sequences and acceptable plot and even a nice ending, but what it doesn't have is anything as amazing as the films outlining premise, it's as if the entire movie dies off the one idea and is content to stay there.Another problem that Next suffers with, is that most of if not all of its best moments are already shown in the trailer, so much like Cris himself I knew what was coming next, that doesn't make them any less cool when the seconds actually arrive but it does mean the film loses much of it's WOW factor.You know what I truly would have preferred to see as appose to the plot they went with for Next? I would have loved to have seen what Cris actually did for however long he was waiting for the girl to show up, imagine being able to see into the next 2 minute's but having the constraint to have to be in one dinner at an exact time every day. What the hell would you do with your time? Now that's a movie.Next also suffers with the ""we are generic foreigner so must be bad guys"" vault, the villains could only be more token if they have moustaches they twiddled, and said the line ""HEY! I'm not from round here!"" Let's forget about Cage for a moment and move onto the other cast members mostly Julianne Moore, Jessica Biel and Peter Falk. While Moore tries her best to do something with her role the dedication is just not there and while Jessica Biel is great to look at, she doesn't bring anything to the movie but eye candy. Finally, it's a shame that this should be Peter Falk's last role.Next is a great idea gone bad, it's not the worst film ever made, but it just could have so easily been so much more.

Next has a brilliant premise, which is what drew me to it in the first place (and some misleadingly good reviews on here !) but it's such a let down. Entertaining enough if all your simple brain demands is yet another guy on the run with FBI, must stop bad guys, explosions and chases type film to add to the identikit hundred or so you've probably seen already. But you'd expect a little bit more than utterly pedestrian with Mr Cage and Miss Moore at the helm. It doesn't deliver.Things start out well enough, but then they always do with these types of films. We're introduced to Cage's character and how the rules of his future seeing world operate through an entertaining spin through Las Vegas. Then things start to go wrong.SPOILERS AHEAD So my first gripe; the terrorists. They're French. What ? . I mean, great break out of film stereotypes and don't make all terrorists Muslims. But I expect some credibility and backstory for the ludicrous notion that French terrorists want to blow up LA with a nuclear bomb. We're never told and it's never explained. What a load of rubbish, why not make them Canadian or from Iceland, makes about as much sense. You've got to lose bucket loads of respect for a film and the imaginary world it's trying to create for two hours with a plot hole this stupid.But it's symptomatic of the lazy storytelling that is such a letdown in this film. The 'rules' of Cage's future seeing universe are explained to us and then conveniently broken whenever a deux et machina plot moment requires it at will. But at this point it's all gotten a bit silly and I've given up caring. Except maybe to wonder why Julianne Moore thinks it's worth wasting her time with this sort of stuff. Can't she get any better work? Oh and the 'twist' at the end. For a moment I thought they we're actually going to do something clever. No, it just gets sillier as yet again they arbitrarily break with the rules they've created. No French terrorists waiting this time, though there should be.Yes, it's entertaining enough, if that's all you want but disappointing in so many areas.It makes you wonder if Hollywood is such a dog eat dog world where only the most talented survive how it can turn out so many dogs of films like this.

But what's all this people say about about ""duuuh destiny err yeah it's like destiny so why'd he do that""? And protest ""It (The director/screenplay/writer) sets up pre-determined rules, and goes ahead to break them all."" I don't think this happens. I found the continuity confusing at times but realise there's elements of fantasy so it doesn't matter anyway. One of the first things Cris says is ""The thing about the future is once you look at it, you change it."" So it's clearly not a rigid specific destiny, but one more simple, like that we are destined to live until we're 80 or whenever. Plus he can change his own destiny so if others are involved with him, theirs can be to. It makes me think more of mind-painting than psychic time-travel. Knowing the facts beforehand and creating the rest around it in his head to discover the best outcome unlike fixed ones like in Heroes or something. I thought that was a unique plot point. I thought it was cool when you realise some of his thoughts haven't even happened yet, all those possibilities yet he can change it all. I even noticed little cool things like the fact that he doesn't even meet Moore till the end, yet in the ""reality"" they meet in the garage at the start and she tells him of the 8million, and he knows for ages before they've even spoken. When in question of Biel's character's mental health when she offers Cris a lift, maybe she's trusting her instincts and she was right to, so what's the problem? Never done that before? He doesn't sleep at her house, he sleeps in the car at a hotel. Someone else said that he didn't do anything to gain her trust blah blah b**ch, he was an interesting and nice guy for Christ's sake!!! All this, her trust, the destiny thing, points to the fact that they have a, you may say other-worldly connection. He dreamt of her for seemingly no reason and sought her. Together he can see further to the future, what's wrong with that?! Come ooooon! I agree that more attention COULD have been played to the terrorist part of the film, but I just think they wanted to concentrate on other things, after all sometimes terrorists=yawn. That's something we don't usually see, all that action and none of it real. You gotta remember it's his ""dream"" we're seeing, he doesn't know everything about the terrorists so neither can we, It wasn't about them, but about him! And her! It does seem odd that he should pursue what he sees as destiny with Biel before saving 8 million people, but again it IS destiny a powerful thing, I think they wanted to concentrate on the build up and conflict of being scared of lifelong experiments rather than getting caught up in the action. All this was explained in the movie! I completely agree it's a shame it ended there. I'm sure we could all see the possibility for a pretty cool continuance and some closure in many areas, but I guess there wasn't time, though they could've petered it out less poorly.. It was like Bam Bam, done... If you hated it surely that's good anyway? This isn't going to ruin it for me though; I took parts of it that were cool into my long term memory. What can I say, I like to enjoy stuff, like my boyfriend. He's not perfect either.",Next

This movie is senseless and hurts the brain of anyone who has watched a movie of real value.The only part of the movie i found remotely entertaining was the sequence where Nic Cage's character morphs into different realms of choices that he could make...that was ""neet"". besides that this movie is real bad.Seriously wasn't there already a movie with Nic Cage in it set in LAs Vegas as a washed up has been or never was?

Julianne Moore was excellently cast as the dispassionate FBI agent bent on making Nicholas Cage's character Cris carry out his destiny, she is definitely suited for these kinds of roles (Ask The Man was not some of her best work). Cris found that when he met Liz(Jessica Biel)whom he had previously envisaged, his ability to see two minutes into the future and therefore change it, was extended indefinitely with really interesting results for the film. There were some very realistic action sequences which had me cringing in my seat, especially the scene when Cris tries to make his escape from the FBI down a canyon. For me the only jarring note in the film was the big age difference between the romantic leads, I really thought Hollywood had outgrown that concept, but it wasn't incongruous enough to spoil a thoroughly satisfactory experience.",Next

But instead, the producers decided that Nicolas Cage had to be saving the US from a nuclear terrorist attack.

Probably the worst aspect of this movie was Julianne Moore's performance as a FBI agent. It was so uninspired and stereotypical. Her lines in the script were so ridiculous; I was laughing every time she spoke. Also, the ending was really lame and left you with a feeling of ""That's its? I want my money back!""

However, a movie that's intriguing and captivating with an ending that is poor will ruin the entire movie.One such movie is Next starring Nicolas Cage.Because of the main character's ability to see 2 minutes ahead in time EXCEPT when experiencing the future with a certain young lady, this made the plot a little confusing. It was difficult to tell what was happening in 'real time' and what has happening 'two minutes ahead'.I watched this movie right to the end, expecting something explosive or at least something thought-provoking to come out of it.However, I found the ending to be akin to "" ... and then he woke up and it was all a dream"". it made me want to throw something at the screen or demand my money back - what an injustice!

Cage's character definitely lacks development as it is hard to understand how he does some of these things until after he does them. The relationship with Biel's character can be easily explained, however it is somewhat creepy if you know their age difference.Overall this was an interesting and one I'll probably watch again as it kept my attention for most of the movie and was fairly entertaining.

Nicholas Cage and Juliann Moore did a great job of this movie. I give kudos because Cage is one of my favorite actors. I think if a movie is going to have a special character or monster or something that does something special, that the movie should show an explanation of how or what exactly goes on and stick to it like any main plot to any one. Many movies like the Matrix turn people away because the movie gets too crazy with what is going on with the storyline,plot, or characters. This movie stuck to its guns and never changed what Cage's character could do, explained it well, and compiled everything together. The biggest drawback of why this movie is not but just a 7 from me is because the movie should have given your moneys worth and added at least 30 minutes to the ending to show you what would happen when he realizes what happened.

If so - with the jumping around and playing with time 'Next' does, you're going to have problems. It'll only annoy you, so give it a miss. Or Ms.*2)* Do you enjoy gritty realism and want all characters, major and minor, blue shirt and red shirt, black hat, white hat - to have believable motivation and backstop? If so - Next is not going to work for you - as parts of it are fluffy and a bit fuzzy and you'll only get cross and distracted about how French mercenaries got hold of a nuclear device and why they are detonating it without asking for a decade's supply of fois gras or something. And how they know where a super secret bit of the FBI hangs out, etc.*3)* Don't you feel movies should have meaning and enrich your soul? I mean; you are giving the best part of two hours of your life away, watching it, right? Hmmmm - if you agree with the above, maybe you should give Next a miss. It's just the terribly well made bit of hokum it was designed to be. (Although on the Philosophical front, it does have one decent joke about a Zen Master and a Hot Dog).*4)* You are a full paid-up, possibly founder, member of the 'I love Nick Cage overacting' club.Another reason not to spring for the rental. Here Mr Cage shows restraint and not a little charm. No nostrils flaring. Not a one. Almost no shouty-shouty. No Big Eyes. You are going to hate this.*5)* You like your endings done up in a bow. With nice red ribbon. And a sparkly tag.This ending is cool, and although completely unexpected - strangely satisfying. If you're not the kind of person who agrees with point 5).IM - obviously not very - HO, Next is a terribly well made picture. All central performances are good and the direction and editing are, for the most, spot on. It's a fairly daft piece of pure entertainment which retains some intelligence, without ever loosing its light touch.It's the kind of mainstream Hollywood movie I wish there was more of and it's way better than most of the movies I've seen in 2008 - so although it's really only an 8.6, I gave it a 9.If Deja-Vu put you off the time travel and sci/fi thing - Next is superior in every single way and even if you're not a Philp K Dick completist - anytime you want to spend a satisfying 96 minutes in a movie theatre or in front of your 50"" Plasma - unless you've ticked one of the above boxes, you could do much, much worse.",Next

The whole thing is undone with a super cringey, unlikely and unnecessary romance featuring Jessica Biel. The chemistry is about as good as a 10 foot pile of sneezing powder and a leaf blower. Not to mention, Moore comes off far more attractive than the one-dimensional plot-filler Biel. Meanwhile, what exactly Cage's future-seeing powers will do to stop the nuke still isn't even revealed by the midpoint of the film, seemingly saving up a big twist that never really comes.

237,pjreiter,Worst Time Travel Movie I've Ever Seen!,4,12 June 2007,"The only thing this movie accomplished was pointing out the fact that the whole idea of time travel is completely ridiculous. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it would take days to explain, but I'll point out a few.First of all, this movie became less and less believable as the movie progressed. When I saw Nicholas Cage split up into several different versions of himself, I burst out laughing. The writers clearly did not have a grasp on the true implications of time travel and simply threw in a few special effect to try and please the audience. Second, all of the supporting actresses were not at all developed and were completely miscast. Julianne Moore as the FBI agent was not at all believable and her acting was laughable to say the least. Jessica Biel as Elizabeth Cooper is definitely pleasing to the eyes, but that's where it ends. Her character was not developed at all and added nothing to the film. Nicholas Cage tried desperately to save this movie, but he was not up to the task.Third, aside from the absurdity of the way time travel is handled in this film, the movie is completely disjointed and the ending of the film is not a surprise at all. It only annoyed me even more. If I'm going to sit through almost two hours of garbage, then I at least want the Hollywood ending. Don't annoy me with some lame attempt at being mysterious at the end.On the positive side, I liked the first 20 minutes of the film. I think the film would've been much better if they just focused on how Nicholas Cage deals with this rare ability instead of trying to have him save the world. Take out the nuclear bomb, FBI, and pretty woman and you might actually have yourself a decent film that deals with the personal problems of being able to see your own future.",Next

Paycheck is not the greatest film in the world and I imagine Philip K Dick would be turning in his grave at both that film and Next but I quite enjoyed Paycheck. It does exactly what you expect, a cheesy action movie, so thats what I expected of this. Sadly I was wrong. Nicholas cage did his usual which is never a bad thing but he looked quite bored most of the time and Jessica biel is........ pretty. The idea of being able to see 2 minutes in the future had great potential and to be honest the first 15 minutes of the film used it really well and I was prepared for a fun ride. After that though it went downhill with a very generic plot that could be summed up on the back of a postage stamp. The fact that Nicholas cage's character knew what was going to happen seemed to ruin the movie and all tension was lost. (POSSIBLE SPOILER)- Jessica Biels trust in him was also a problem I had with the film. It all happened so quickly and yet dragged at the same time if that makes sense!! Their scenes together were really quite dull and call me old fashioned but did she really need to jump into bed with the guy so quickly!! Sadly unless Jessica starts to improve she will be stuck in her own time-warp playing dull supporting characters who are only required to walk around in towels and low cut tops. Not that I have too much of a problem with that but let's be honest she isn't a very good actress. The ending of the film wasn't a problem for me like it seems to be for others so that didn't disappoint me but the film as a whole did.

239,youbroketherules,Promising Big Budget Fare Devolves Into Complete Garbage,3,31 January 2008,"When the opening credits rolled and I noticed that this was based on a story by legendary writer Philip K. Dick, my anticipation for this film went up a bit. The previews I saw before this movie's theatrical release certainly piqued my interest... the concept was good enough, and the action looked enticing.As the first scenes rolled, I was pleased that it wasn't a ""Shaky Cam"" affair like so many modern action movies... the director apparently knew how to frame a shot, put it on a tripod, and put the interest in the scene and not in the camera movement.The set-up of the characters was interesting enough, and in the first act I found myself in the warm confines of a big budget Hollywood movie... sure you can't expect anything too soul stirring or brain building from this type of movie, but you can at least expect to be pleased. This is where everything started going sour.Nicholas Cage gets sleeps with Jessica Biel after one day of knowing her. These are supposed to be nice characters falling in love, not raving sex maniacs, so this plot turn basically just insulted my intelligence and sensibilities and made me think these characters were full of crap. But it gets worse. The main character's gimmick is that he can see 2 minutes into the future, only if it involves him. This gimmick gets absolutely TRASHED as the movie goes on. I don't know if anybody in the screen writing or directing department could explain the elements that appear later in the movie to me and how they pertain to the 2 minute clairvoyance bit, but it seems like they just abandoned his actual power and gave him extra SUPER POWERS for the hell of it. Cage can DODGE BULLETS, and not just one bullet, but a FULL CLIP of bullets as a bad guy unloads it on him. Then, when the bad guy is out of ammo, Cage walks up to him and punches him. Is he SUPERMAN NOW? I normally don't get upset over lapses in logic if the action is good, but the action in this picture is so-so and the logic is SEVERELY LAPSED. It's PG-13 lite action with some really obvious CGI, and my disbelief was not suspended in the least. It seems like the actors knew they were doing something crappy and the performances from the pros were very spotty... not to mention the supporting cast (the black FBI agent SUCKED... it seemed like they didn't even audition the part, they just picked the first guy through the door).The film just absolutely DEFLATED as it went on, and by the time the climax came it was just too ridiculous to care about. And then they committed the ultimate final insult... ""It was all but a dream."" That's right, folks. The entire second half of the movie was hypothetical, and Mr. Next (who sees TWO MINUTES into the future, but somehow, for the purposes of this plot, was able to see several DAYS into the future, with 2 minute glimpses across the entire vision???) gets to start over and make a different choice, saving the girl he hopped into bed with after one day because he thinks she's the love of his life, and heading towards another scenario where the world ends, only to probably start it all over again. I guess in Next world, nothing bad can ever happen because Mr. Cage can go back in time and simply change things around! What a crock! I'm vacillating between giving this 3 or 4 out of ten. Thinking about 4 because there were competent elements of production, but ultimately settling on 3 because by the time the movie was over I felt insulted.",Next

Biel collected an easy paycheck for a role that was not necessary for the ""plot"". Moore's character was the only one in the FBI that was even remotely competent. Which makes me feel real good about national security. And the terrorists. Why, and how would they even know about Chris Johnson? And if he is all they think he is, there is no way to beat him.

But as he is sitting in the Landcruiser with Biel shortly after their initial meeting, all the viewer can think is, ""he's a weirdo! Throw him out! Now!!!"" Short of drooling, Cage could not be any less alluring. He's all mahogany tan, veneered teeth, hair weave and bog-eyes - and, not to be cruel, he looks his age. It is hard to believe that Liz would go near him with a twenty-foot clown pole.The quality of the rest of the cast is abysmal. Amateur dramatic productions would have been ashamed of the performances by the actors playing the terrorists. They were beyond wooden.Poor Julianne Moore looks thoroughly peeved to have been part of the whole fandango.

243,Fugitive_at_imdb,Different writer tacked on different ending,1,26 July 2008,"HUGE Spoilers HERE But it is my duty to spoil it for you. If you watch this film after my review, and I had not spoiled it, you would forever blame me. Therefore...This whole movie hangs on the mysteries of who has the power to see in the future, and for how long. We know Nick sees forward two minutes, and we know Jessica helps enhance that time limit. We also know someone within the bad guy unit knows about Nick, and starts off the bad guy mission by having the bad guys find and kill Nick.This leads me to believe the original script writers would leave the ""big tell"" until the end: When the main bad guy shows up to explain Nick and Jessie's powers, how he knows about them, and why he's suddenly this main bad guy who wants to destroy California. With that ending, this would have been a solid seven or seven-point-five flick. Not great, not terrible, but okay enough to sit through.HOWEVER, some dude somewhere thought it would be either cooler or cheaper to just have a sad ending, then show it was all a much longer vision of the future than Nick thought he had, and then have Nick run off to change it to a better ending. Fade to black and leave 'em talking. That was the new plan. And congratulations. You got us talking. But what we'll talk about- every chance we get- is how no one should ever invest anything at all in this movie.",Next

I must be honest and say the movie bored the crap out of me. Not as bad as redline but still a very slow and uneventful movie. Nothing about it grabbed a hold me and made me want to care about it. The way it just prodded along with little emotion and cgi that wasn't too hot, made this seem like it was over a two hour movie.

He claims he can watch 2 minutes in the future, so what the hell? 2 million illusionists over the world do so! Weird. How the hell can she get the whole FBI listening to her? They are looking for a 50 kiloton nuclear bomb! Then, why does Nicolas Cage run? Why doesn't he corporate with the FBI? He doesn't feel like saving the world from an (Russian blondish French-speaking) terrorist group who have 50 kiloton (!) nuclear bomb? mm, weird.When Liz has to poison Nicolas she has to wait two minutes.. Err.. WHY? Because he can look 2 minutes ahead? No, it doesn't make sense at all.Oh yes, why do the terrorists want to kill him? How do they even know he exists? Well,that were a few of the many confusing plot holes. The movie itself isn't very bad, but it could've been much better. The special effects were OK and the acting was good too.

It was entertaining and fun with enough suspense to draw you in but avoided unnecessary sub plots and detail taking you off course.

Although there are some nice moments the script is definitely not quite there, the performances are poor, the visual style gets ridiculous and everything starts to crumble down when instead of tension you get nervous laughter.

Not sure where people keep getting the idea that Cage can act. But at this age, he's getting really hard on the eyes. And when paired with someone who's more than 20 years younger than him, it gets ridiculous fast. (All the hot Playmate-like babes like Biel are looking for run-over guys like Cage? Yeah, maybe in bizarro world.) If you had Nick Cage's clairvoyant ""gift,"" you'd be doing a million other things than hanging out in Vegas. Trust me.

252,radiocep,Why is this not doing well?.... oh yeah....,7,3 May 2007,"I will not go over the plot, which has been commented on by so many people already. The point is that this film is really not that bad, the script has some clever points and the idea (based on PKD)is passable for a Hollywood production. So what is bad? Location, Location, Location... and some pretty poor bad guys. We have our lead good guy fighting against the government who wants to stop a bomb from going off. Wow, those are some pretty evil fellas indeed. More then half the film is about Cage running from those who are trying to protect others, rather than from the bad guys of the week who are trying to set off a massive bomb to .... well... uh.... kill people. Now those guys are really evil. Seems like the point of the film is for Cage to keep outrunning everyone who wants him to comprise his precious life. If you and your family are about to be killed because of a nuke and there was a chance some Vegas magician would save you, I would personally strap him to a chair and make him see beyond two minutes in the future. As for the settings of the scenes, frankly they were all pretty boring. You go from Vegas into canyons and then back to the city. Every location, setting was just unimportant. I guess it looked better on paper then on screen. Cage is great, he has his way of acting which is always fun to watch, but I had the feeling that this entire production was rushed. I don't think ""good acting"" was as important as getting the film finished and in the can. Its sad really, this could have been another Minority Report, with style but without Tom Cruise.",Next

Tension soars to the highest when the audience, already fed with the events' outcome, await to see how the characters cast off the perils.

254,filmvisuality,Swing and a Miss,2,8 March 2008,"The concept of this film was actually what drew me to it, seeing 2 minutes into the future, based on the sci-fi master Phillip K. Dick's novel ""The Golden Man"", a very intriguing idea. However, like many adaptations of Dick's novels, the film falls short, in this case - extremely.What we have in this film is the over-used nuclear bomb in major US city story (see The Peacemaker etc.). Now after reading that, one could question what the hell a psychic has to do with a nuclear bomb if he can only see 2min into the future. So did I even after seeing the film.The plot has gigantic holes, the nuclear attack is never seen as a major catastrophe by anyone in the entire film - no panic at all, whilst the fluctuation of clairvoyance will annoy any sane viewer. If any of the film actually seems like reality - get some pills and take them.Characterisation was not a strong point in this film. Chris (Cage) had no back-story other than a recitation of what happened to him in 3rd grade. Jessica Biel's character is likewise, let's not even touch Julianne Moore's role. The opposition, the bad guys in this film, some kind of terrorist organisation is never detailed and the viewer is left with a sense of depravity. The romance between Cage and Biel is another issue, being both creepy and contrived, with their relationship blossoming after such a short period of time with no real catalyst.The acting is never realistic bar Biel's role, who surprisingly out-acts both Cage and Moore. The special effects are abysmal - modern technology should be able to make things blend in rather than stand out. And the narration at start and end? Come on, thats about as bad as The Golden Compass' narration.And the script seems like it was written in a couple of days just to meet a deadline - no fact is involved and every generalisation of the FBI is evident.But is there a saving grace for this film? Let's look at what garners those precious two stars (1/5). The ending was a very intriguing choice and I actually have to hand it to them for blind-sighting us like that, although I still don't like how it was made possible. There's the cool effect that highlights the different paths Cage could take - you'll know it when you see it. The best part of the film? The opening in the casino - very cool. Unfortunately after that it falls off Mt. Everest and hits the bottom.There is a reason this film is labeled Action rather than Thriller...you get the picture.visuality.",Next
255,demicore,This movie feeds on the souls of small kittens.,1,26 April 2007,"I just went to see it this morning and a huge pot of macadamia nut brittle vanilla ice cream wasn't enough to soften the bitterness (yes), I am thus compelled to write my first ever movie review in order to try and keep people from giving their hard-earned cash to whatever evil corporation struck this movie upon us.This ""movie"" is about Chris Johnson, a guy who can see up to two minutes (except when the plot suddenly decides it's three hours) in the future. He uses this power in a cautious manner as to not attract too much attention on him and lead a peaceful life until he can finally meet True Love (tm), since he saw in a vision that a hot woman would one day enter his favorite restaurant at 8:09. So one day his dream finally comes true, although it turns out the girl in question is a gigantic prick. Not to worry though, Chris Johnson can see in the future WITH HIS MIND POWER and thus imagine every possible way to win the hot woman's heart, since everybody knows the sure-fire way to long term relationships is to hide your personality and put up an act. Sure enough when night comes up they end up in the same bed, and thus become lovers forever. Unfortunately this is the exact time European terrorists decide it's a good idea to bomb LA. At least I assume they are European, sadly there only was the dubbed version of the movie at my local theater but I think I heard one of them speaking German and another had his lips perfectly in sync with his voice, so he was probably French. Their motive is never explained. Thus begins a convoluted (by which I mean SHITTY) plot involving the two main characters making huge sacrifices for each other since they are True Loves and the bad guys being terribly retarded, accompanied by some of the worst CGI I've seen in the last few years along with horrible acting (although admittedly judgement is always clouded in dubbed movies). To top it all off, the ending is OBVIOUS.Apart from Jessica Biel's beautiful body and the comic relief brought by Cage's haircut there is absolutely nothing remotely interesting in this movie, it simply is a gigantic waste of time and money. Tamahori made Mullholand Falls, Cage made, hell, he's acted great in tons of awesome movies, so I can only assume Next was intentionally made in order to crush the very minds of its viewers, then Tamahori can make a movie about it and get tonsa cash, there I discovered the whole plan.

The movie's plot is a winding road of nonsense, the characters are strange and the music is generic.
Nicolas Cage's acting as usual is stellar but not for the reasons you'd expect, he's goofy and dumb and we all love watching him do stupid stuff.
The way the cinematography incorporates his looks into the future is actually really cool, showing the camera pan slowly as he gets up and tries to talk to someone, failing, then the camera pans back to find him still sitting down thinking the situation over.

260,makbeth-1,A perfect snapshot of 2007 in bad movie tropes,2,18 June 2014,"I gave this movie a 2-star review not because it is truly awful, but because it doesn't deserve the rating that it ""deserves"". As a standalone movie, if it were made in 1997 for example, it would be pretty good. The real disdain for this movie comes from its cheapness.They really tried hard to cram as much popular tropes as they could into this movie. It is pure cheese, and extremely difficult to take seriously as a result. The title for a start, a single word which is supposed to convey a sort of intrigue and a coolness while giving a bit of a hint towards the story to me seems like the laziest part. ""next"", ie the ability to foresee ""what will happen next"" I guess sounded cooler than ""happen"" ""what"" or ""will"" and so got used in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of shows like ""lost"", ""24"" etc. The result is a really stupid title, which completely suits the movie.The plot itself is pretty standard, and extremely contrived. I wont go into detail due to spoilers but the movie builds on hype and false drama to a point where there is no possible resolution.In general, the movie sacrifices realism to look cool, plays off every cliché it can, builds the stakes at every opportunity and cheaps out massively when it comes to resolution. It tries very hard to look like a movie that makes you think, but it doesn't try very hard to make you think.Its a cheep generic action movie and if you don't hold it accountable for its plot line it is watchable. However this movie is extremely cheep. It looks as though it was made to sell based on a cool trailer and replicating other popular media trends. Its The Da Vinci code meets Minority Report starring Nicolas Cage.",Next
261,sucalguy,True Lies was better.,4,12 January 2008,"Maybe because like half of the people in Los Angeles I have written screenplays or maybe because I'm an accountant by training and have a very logical mind, but this screenplay needed another run through the word processor.OK, here's what's wrong with this film. First, everybody's favorite line. ""It may take a week, it may take a month, but I'll find you."" Nick says this to Jessica Beil twice. The first time he says it I'm thinking, ""Well, yeah, you know where she teaches once a week, so you just have to go there on that day."" The second time he says it, and this maybe a spoiler, he has the FBI behind him. I think they can find one teacher in Las Vegas. Major, major plot hole that you can drive a semi through, after Jessica helps Nick escape, do the FBI take her into protective custody? No. They forget all about her and naturally the bad guys kidnap her. In regard to the above, what was she doing walking down the country road all alone? What was she going to do walk back to Vegas from Flagstaff? Two minor points here: 1) Nick tells Jessica in the café that he is supposed to be in Flagstaff, she offers him a ride. Yet, when they go to Flagstaff he hangs with her and then drives back with her. She never asked him ""Didn't you say you needed to be in Flagstaff?"" 2)After Jessica helps Nick to escape by destroying half the motel, no one comes up and ask her for her visa card to pay for all the damage she has caused. Another peeve, the bad guys sniper doesn't have a clear shot at Nick because of a post, yet minutes later he's standing out in the open. Shot him then.OK, now the million dollar question, why are the bad guys looking for Nick in the first place? How do they know that he can see into the future? How do they know that the FBI is going to try and use him to catch them? And why do they seek him out at the exact same time the FBI is looking for him? Couldn't they go after him a week earlier? No. To logical. Then there wouldn't be a story.Now, the 64 dollar question. Why are the French trying to blow up Los Angeles? Are they still mad over the whole Freedom fries verses French fries thing? Or is it because we make movies like Next and Margot at the Wedding? Maybe political correctness still exists and to use the real people who want to blow up LA would be seen as being to anti _______. You fill in the blank.There was some good parts to Next. I liked the fight seen in the café. I like how Nick saw where all the bad guys were in the warehouse. Nick is a good actor.The screenplay has the standard boss ""Julianne"" barking orders at people. ""I want to know the second something related to Chris Johnson happens."" Well, your subordinate told you the second he found out. And where was she going to after she released Nick from the chair? Her office? True Lies is much better. My opinion, Arnold's a dud as a governor, and I had such high hopes for him. Really, I did. He is better than the truly dull Grey Davis, but still a dud.

Dick properties, and then ""adapt"" them for the screen - which in the process ruins them completely. Of all of the films made from PKD stories, only ""Blade Runner"" and ""A Scanner Darkly"" are worthy of their source material. Did the screenwriters for ""Next"" really need the inspiration of PKD in order to concoct this collection of warmed-over leftovers? Besides its (lack of) value as an adaptation, however, ""Next"" also fails completely as a film. It takes an overdone science fiction premise (what if someone could actually see into the future?), throws in some name actors to give it star attraction and sex appeal (the section of the film which deals with Nicolas Cage's clichéd attempts to seduce Jessica Biehl was lame beyond description), and then tries to mix it in with an anti-terrorism plot lifted from ""24."" (Oh, my God - ambiguously ethnic terrorists from some unnamed country have smuggled a nuclear bomb into Los Angeles for some unstated purpose! I've NEVER seen that one before!)

Sounds interesting eh?...well the movie plot is even more interesting.Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) is a magician in some Nevada casino...earning his daily bread by showcasing his sleight of hand(s) and ordinary magic tricks to a small gathered audience at the casino. But by no means is he an ordinary human being. He can see the future...more precisely; he can see what happens to him in the next 2 minutes. And so, FBI Agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) thinks Cris Johnson can help her team track down terrorists planning a nuke attack.My initial thoughts when I read this plot were  WOW! A Magician helping the FBI...that must be an interesting watch. But somehow this show falters and it wasn't as gripping as I thought it to be. It became quite predictable in between so much so that I became Cris Johnson for a while and was able to predict what was gonna happen in the movie in the next two minutes!! For most part of the 95 minutes, Agent Callie Ferris is chasing down Cris Johnson who somehow manages to elude her,all the time  courtesy, his powers of seeing the future. Some scenes in the movie are entertaining. Take this case when he sees the beautiful Elizabeth Cooper (Jessica Biel) in a restaurant. He tries to see the endings of using all possible pick up lines from coffee beans to asking for a light to being a macho and sees that none of them would work for him. Finally he comes up with this conventional one  'being a normal guy trying to help a beautiful girl' and sees that Ms Cooper would be alright with this approach. He does that and well...he gets the sympathy of Ms Liz Cooper!...I just wondered - How we blokes would love such a power...at least on Friday  Saturday nights! It would be fun!...Anyways getting back to the movie  Hadn't it been for the final twist, I would have rated this as an ordinary show. Watch it only if you've got nothing to do.",Next
264,Citizen_J10,An OK plot premise destroyed with terrible storytelling,5,12 November 2008,"I'm not usually very critical about films and I almost always find something good from any film that I can say was worth experiencing. I'm even a fan of action films and Nicolas Cage has been in many of my favourites. However, it is really painful and hard to try to find a single good thing from this movie.Here are the positives. The premise of the plot is quite fun and the opening sequence in the casino is entertaining and well done. The scenery is nice and action sequences are stylish even if enjoying most of them is hard because of the plot that leads to them.And that leads us to the plot which is terrible. I mean it, it is simply terrible. It's full of clichés, inconsistencies and in the end it's quite boring because of those. I tried my best to enjoy the movie and suspend my disbelief but I couldn't do it because the plot is constantly breaking its own rules and making idiotic twists that don't make any sense nor are they very interesting.The characters are paper thin. It's painful to watch how Julianne Moore comes across as a one-dimensional hard-ass with clichéd lines because she's a good actress. Cage is OK but some of his facial expressions are a bit ridiculous. Biel is there for the eye-candy and she fills that role nicely enough. And the bad guys? I have no idea who they are other than that they look tough and speak with ridiculous accents. Another cliché.The relationship between Cage and Biel is forced and unimpressive. I didn't see a single moment where Cage's character displayed enough charm or anything to seduce Biel's character. He gets beaten up, then comes across as a creepy stalker by constantly staring at her and talking weird things. Then he does a magic trick and says a few lame jokes and suddenly Biel is in love with him. I'm sorry but that's ridiculous. And Cage's bad hair doesn't help his charm one bit.All in all, the movie really crashed down because of its plot. It's simply stupid, clichéd and full of holes and inconsistencies. Therefore the characters are paper thin and the action becomes more or less meaningless eye-candy.I'm surprised how much I didn't enjoy the movie given that I usually do enjoy these kind of movies. It had potential to be so much better. If you want to see an example of a screenplay that completely destroyes the original material, watch this movie.4.5/10",Next

First and foremost, my opinion of the writing went from mediocre to bad by the film's end, and some of the goofy dialog was not helped at all by the actors. The romantic subplot was simply ridiculous, not to mention Nicholas Cage just came off as plain awkward. Now there was a good bit of action, but the gun fights towards the climax felt a bit disorganized at times. Of course, that doesn't really matter, considering the majority of the rising action and the climax didn't ACTUALLY happen. Yes, that's right, just as you think that it's all over and the good guys lost, you find out that the main character hasn't even left the room he was in half an hour earlier in the film. At that point, the ACTUAL ending doesn't even begin to compensate for anything you had just seen.Finally, I'd like to mention that, despite the DVD synopsis making a point of the fantastic visual effects, I found them...bad, to say the least. The CG-dependent visual effects composition shots looked like graphics in a cut scene of a next gen video game console.

272,chasdj,I Believe This Film Is Much Better Than The Public Realizes,9,14 May 2007,"Prior to seeing ""Next,"" I had read or heard general reviews which were more negative than positive. However, I usually enjoy Nicholas Cage films and was intrigued by the concept of limited precognition, so I and a good friend went to see the movie. Both my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed Next! The movie begins with a well-measured pace but once the main character and his ability is introduced the pace quickens. Much like a roller coaster ride, it slows (as does the coaster ascending its first major slope) but once it speeds down the other side it slows only occasionally, and then only somewhat, before twisting, turning, and turning the audience upside down repeatedly.I use the roller coaster analogy because both my friend and I ""felt"" as though the movie took us on just such a ride. Tension, intrigue, confusion, questions, uncertainty. Then brief lulls before the ride's finale. I do not know if sequels are intended for the Cage character but I hope one or more is planned.Each viewer will need to evaluate the ending and draw your own conclusions. I enjoyed everything about this film and consider it one of the best I have seen during the past year (which includes Spider Man 3).I highly recommend this film.",Next

Hot girl bouncing around, vague foreign bad guys with guns, vague domestic good guys with guns... and the hero has a special power to see into the future.Bad script, bad directing, bad acting (especially on Cage's part).

275,jeff-717,A wonderful thought experiment that tests both the strength and fragility of love between man and woman.,9,5 April 2008,"""Next"" is a wonderful thought experiment that tests both the strength and fragility of love between man and woman. This reviewer recently lambasted ""Atonement"", so I figure I'll offset that critique with a positive one. ""Next"" appears to be an action/adventure story spun around the paranormal, but that's just a masquerade as it is really a love story (which I'd argue could have had an even stronger love story spin). Okay, understood, most of us gotta have our guns, kung-fu, explosions and the like to remind us how badly we want good to triumph over evil. But the love story is really what drives the plot. (I can't say more without ruining the story surprises). Nicholas Cage's acting is right on and his pathos made me feel his pain. His character is not as self-satisfied as one might imagine given the amazing gift he's been given (therein lies some irony in our real lives, eh? if this universe gives someone a special talent or good looks, you'd think they'd be particularly humble about it, no?). Jessica Biel is very attractive and the twosome's chemistry makes you want to see them wind up together. I also really liked that Cage's character, a sort of ugly, physically fit geek type, is still able to win the girl's affection. The time-bending aspect of this storyline in some strange way reminds me of ""Donnie Darko"" -- except that the ending in ""Next"" is upbeat.It really says something about Philip K. Dick that Hollywood just keeps going back to his work for inspiration. PKD's ideas are indeed pure genius. Screamers. Total Recall (We Can Remember It For You Wholesale). Imposter (starring Gary Sinise). Blade Runner. A Scanner Darkly. Minority Report. All well-told tales.Okay, so all this said, this film's premise: A man who can see 2 minutes into his own future -- is actually nonsensical because of one thing: there is no such thing as Time. I am utterly convinced that ""time"" is a construct of the human mind. It is a variable. A transform (like Fourier, or s transforms). ""Time"" is a transform of distance. That's why any stories that are dependent on manipulating time or ""traveling in time"" are all equally ridiculous -- though I'm one of many who also greatly enjoyed the remake of ""Time Machine"". When someone says ""he traveled back in time"" -- it makes as much sense to say, ""he traveled back down a yardstick"". You don't believe me? What is the definition of 24 hours? It is the angular distance the Earth travels to make one complete rotation about its axis. We ""see"" the passing of ""time"" in a physical sense as the rising, setting, and rising of the sun. Sure it can be argued that human beings experience ""time"" in terms of duration but duration itself is extremely subjective. For instance, while you are sitting in a boring 90 minute meeting at work, it can feel that the minutes are dragging by way too slowly. However, your sense of duration during a 90 minute film (like Next) is likely to shrink dramatically and before you know it, it's over.Movies I really pine for are both inspiring and sensitive to the human condition. I'll list a few others I've liked very much: ""Peaceful Warrior"", ""Magnolia"", ""American Beauty"", ""Best In Show"", ""Sonnenschein"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Dead Man"", ""The Lathe Of Heaven"", ""True Romance"", ""Fight Club"", ""My Name Is Nobody"", ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", ""A.I."", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""I Worship His Shadow"", ""Casablanca"", ""Notorious"", ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"".",Next
276,The_All_Knowing_2010,the fall of cage,1,15 July 2007,"Have you ever wondered whether you are classed as clinically stupid? here's an easy test, watch this movie and if you liked it or just thought is was OK then i'm afraid you may have to consult an intelligence doctor. I can see from other comments that this condition is quite common (either that or people involved in the production have IMDb membership). If you have intelligence on a par with a banana then you might coast through this movie not noticing why it is so soul crushingly stupid but if you take a second to dissect each scene, character and motivation then a pattern of retardation appears that is truly astonishing. The people who made this movie have all done good work in the past so quite why this cinematic equivalent to a stay at the abu graid holiday inn turned out the way it did is something of a mystery (was it deliberate, laziness or substance fuelled????). The turd like quality of the film is established very early on and about twenty minutes into the ""film"" you give up on any expectation that it is going to get any better, I actually started looking around the cinema at the wallpaper and lights and just generally trying to keep myself amused. After about three quarters of an hour you start to realise that this is just going to keep getting worse and you wonder how the hell it is going to end, how the hell are they going to come up with an ending that can match the stupidity of the rest of the film?? you start to conjure up lame endings in your mind and think ""no way would they end it like that, no one would be that stupid"" and then you get to the ""twist"", Oh my Christ is it lame! the whole cinema was in agreement, I have never heard a whole theatre groan in unison and there was something comforting in that groan that let me know I was not going through this experience alone and that others shared my pain. The ending is a whole lot more stupid than any ending I had thought up and you stare slack jawed in disbelief as you watch an actual movie give up on itself, it's like the movie commits suicide before it can get to any atrocious ending the writers or director had planned. I will be watching this movie again though but I will be watching it as a bad movie much in the same way you would watch Troll II or Plan 9 or my personal favourite bad movie Howling VII (someone greenlight a new Clive Turner project please!!!!).",Next

Excellent stuff.They seem to change Cages abilities when the ""plot"" needs it.Bad CGI set pieces with Cage dodging exploding trucks, bullets and falling logs.Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse the ending gives you one last slap in the face, the silver lining being that at least this turd had finished.Nicolas Cage also looks so weird now, one of those people from California who have had too much plastic surgery and time in the sun.

282,lameplanet,A great idea let down by a mediocre script,5,17 February 2008,"I really wanted to like this movie, and was prepared to cut it some slack despite the negative reviews, but I have to say that after 45 minutes I found it hard to carry on watching. The idea had a lot of merit but the script really sunk the movie.The story could have and should have been handled much better. From the beginning you could feel that the writers were letting the plot boss the script to the point where it had become an ugly patchwork of one-dimensional dialogue, expositional lumps and jarring dynamics. Within the first 15 minutes so much has happened, so many characters introduced and so many key elements of the plot have been forced onto the screen that there's no time for pacing or allowing the characters to develop naturally. The whole time I could feel the writers thinking ""we're running out of time, how do we get *this* plot point or *that* character on screen and into the mix asap"". Ugh. It was horrible to watch. Every scene seemed to be engineered purely to get some point across - from the FBI bossing telling the agent (why? she obviously knows.) all about the bomb and how and when it got lost and how crucial it is to find it, so NO they don't have the time to waste chasing magicians (and then in the next sentence, barely drawing a breath, giving her 5 days to find him), to the stupid scene where the Cage's love interest visits some kids and there's the swelling of violins and one of the kids says something like ""i think that man you're with really likes you.."" (cue more violins). Okay, we've checked off the love interest now BANG onto the next scene.Well, you can tell I'm ranting now - but essentially everything is so clunky, so rushed, so darn *obvious*. The characters never get a chance to really live and the believability breaks down as you feel the artifice of the script squeezing everything.It's a shame because Cage tries his best with the little his given, and there's good moments where the sense of reality shifts between the *real* events and the *about to be* events in Cage's clairvoyant mind. But whenever I started to get into the movie, within a few moments, there was the CLUNK of some awful dialogue, or nonsensical plot development, and the spell was broken.It's not really a terrible movie, so much as a frustrating one, but with the premise they could have done better.",Next

284,nelly234,A balance between good and bad,5,26 January 2009,"Next is a science-fiction thriller which according to its producers is based on Phillip K. Dick's short-story The Golden Man. However, this claim is more likely a means to gain publicity, for there is only one element that seems to truly originate from it : an individual possessing a premonition gift is chased by the government. For all Phillip K. Dick fans, this movie should be a disappointment : the true story, its morality, its complexities are forgotten and twisted into a completely different and considerably less original plot.Once we push this details aside, Next remains a rather enjoyable movie, unfortunately it contains numerous and quite frustrating flaws that could have been avoided with ease. Let's say the beginning, while a bit shaky, still holds the road well, but that from roughly half of the film, the entire storyline goes haywire.Cris Johnson is a man who uses his power to run a cheap magic show in Vegas and incidentally win at gambling. He appears to be calm and melancholic, much of a loner ; above all he is a neutral character who doesn't think of his ability to be either good or bad and uses it conveniently in life. However he has an interesting side to himself : he is very cultured - his random anecdotes are honestly funny and add a bit of color to his otherwise dull personality. Nicolas Cage gives as usual a nonchalant performance, neither brilliant neither poor, and looks comfortable in his role. His haircut is probably one of the worst haircuts in the history of motion pictures, but it's what's inside that counts... or whatever. Julianne Moore is excellent as Callie Ferris, a tough FBI agent determined to stop a nuclear disaster at any cost. Jessica Biel convincingly portrays Liz Cooper, a young, attractive and faithful young woman - so faithful, in fact, that she doesn't mind casually offering a ride to a complete stranger and walking around him dressed in nothing but a towel. The fact that she naively asks ""What ?"" when he stares at her in awe indicates that she might no be the brightest light bulb of the century.One of the good elements of Next is the occasional humor : for instance, the way Johnson's power can be used to try out different ways to seduce a woman is not only amusing but quite original. However, this ability constantly mutates throughout the movie. At first it is said Johnson can see two minutes into his own future. Eventually, it shows he can actually analyze different scenarios : this is more than simple clairvoyance. Further ahead, he is able to see into several distinctive futures and in the end simply goes all Matrix-style when Mr Smith repeatedly shoots him. Also not clear is that two-minutes range : if he can see two minutes in the future whenever he wishes, why does Ferris tell Cooper to wait two minutes before poisoning his drink ? How is that supposed to impair his vision ? Furthermore, if the FBI know that Johnson cannot see further than two minutes, it is unclear how they expect him to see where the nuclear device will be deployed.The FBI's intrigues and the nuclear device scheme are also the main reasons for all the incoherences. Apparently, they are incapable of stopping a nuclear threat without the help of a seer. Not only that, instead of trying to actually prevent the menace, they will rather chase said seer all around the USA, only because one agent is convinced that he in fact can see into the future, while there are so many magicians and visionaries and God knows how many more gifted people in the entire world. Moreover, the threat itself doesn't make much sense : do European terrorists randomly steal H-bombs in Russia and try to blow up Los Angeles, without any particular reason, political or economic motive whatsoever ? While we are at raising questions and pointing out incoherences, unfortunately the end of the movie as stated below is full of them, such as the FBI blindly trusting Johnson into leading them and not even giving him a bullet-proof vest, or the whole terrorist plan-that-is-not-one in which they drag Liz along with them without even knowing what the hell they are trying to do, kill Johnson or take care of the bomb ? But let us not focus too much on this, for the viewer will surely notice it himself. The ending, though surprising, is in fact logical, and somewhat a relief - after all everything will repeat itself. The film has made its point, we do not need to see it all again.As a last warning, although it is a thriller, this movie isn't so thrilling. The action scenes are poorly shot, as they don't inspire real impatience, surprise or suspense, and the music doesn't help - it is your typical, not-particularly-special action movie music. In a nutshell, Next is unpredictable in its own way, funny at times, full of incoherences, tiring in the end, and will fill your free time.",Next

The ending is appalling, so much so that all my English teachers would have been ashamed had it been written or directed by me.I call this: 'They taught me not to make this movie in year 7' because when I was in year 7 my teacher always used to say: ""Never, and I mean NEVER finish any stories you write with: 'He woke up and it was all a dream' or you will fail, because it is unimaginative, uninteresting, and irritating for all those who are made to read it.""

292,summerreighn,Made no logical sense,3,19 August 2015,"Aprently it was an adaption of a short story by Philip K Dick ""The Golden Men"" which I have not read. So my review comes strictly from what I saw of the Hollywood story in NEXT staring Nicholas Cage as Chris Johnson a melancholy magician in Vagas who uses his power/ability or whatever you want to classify it of being able to see 2 minutes into his own future and see all of the deferent possible out comes. Early in the movie you are told that FBI agent Callie Farris (Julianna Moore) has discovered Chris's future seeing ability and for some implausible reason thinks he can help them locate and disarm a nuclear bomb that is going kill millions of Americans. Which makes little to no sense because this has nothing to directly do with Chriss future and even if it did how would a two minute advantage really help in this situation? For a reason unexplained Chris wants no part and doesn't really seem to care about all of the people who could potentially die and goes to pretty extreme measures to avoid helping the FBI which makes his character dispissable. With that being said the first escape scene is pretty intertianing to watch. After Cage escapes from the FBI and the opportunity to potinally save millions of lives he is on the hunt for a woman who he has been repeatedly dreaming of meeting and allows him to see even further into the future past his two minute limit. He waits for her in a diner and there is a clever scene of there first interactions played out into several different scenarios until he finds the right one that will get Liz (Jessica Beil) to allow a total stranger to jump in her Land Rover and drive to flag staff with her. They make a pit stop at the reservation she teaches at, which provides some beautiful scenery to the movie. They continue on in a cheesy forced scene where Liz somehow ends up passing out all the way over into the drive seat onto Chriss shoulder. Then the end up stuck staying at a motel where Beil is uncomfortable with Cage staying in the room, which a total normal reaction but all that logic is wasted as where in the morning she is totally fine prancing around naked in a towel in the same hotel room with him. Shortly after that Liz throughs herself at Chris and there is the obvious innuendo that they hooked up with out the sex scene which I'm thankful for because it was hard enough to believe that a woman like Jessica Biel would hook up with him man 18 years her senior like Nicholas Cage. Liz goes outside and is confronted by Faris and she tells him that Chris is a sociopaths and that he is very dangerous and she needs to drug him and turn him over peacefully to the FBI. Liz drugs his drink but then at the last minute has second thoughts and tells him about the drug in his drink and tells him about her encounter with the FBI agent. She ask the obvious question of why he is refusing to help which gives her the explanation that's just not how his powers work I couldn't help thinking come on man isn't worth a try to save millions of lives? I guess not I guess it's easier to plan the next ecape which ends up in the scene of a downhill avalanche and car chase which was pretty entertaining and had some OK CGI effects, but the continued extreme links he goes to avoid the FBI to not help all of these people just added onto my hate for his character. He is eventually captured by the FBI when he chooses to save Ferris's life the one redeeming action his character has. The FBI hook him up to a machine much like in the clockwork Orange making him watch news broadcast hoping he will get a glimpse of the detonation location. He instead see Liz with a bomb vest as a terrorist hostage. He uses his ability to ecape the FBI and is conveniently located across the street from where Liz is going to be blown up. He now and only now agrees to help Ferris save all of the millions of lives now that it directly affects his new love interest. There is a climactic scene where he now develops into multiple selves exploring multiple futures and pathways at the same time. And now show superhuman likability to dodge bullets in a matrix style fashion to catch the terrorist. With Liz safely in his arms Ferris has an look at a monitor to see if you can see when and where the bomb going to go off. He realizes that he is made a mistake in the bomb detonates and destroys the port in the entire city. *spoiler* Then in a painful plot twist Time reverts all the way back to where they were lying in bed together after their initial hook up letting us know that the entire two thirds of the movie that we watched did not happen but only was it foreseeing into the future. Ending with a cheesy line something along the lines when you see the future it changes... He leaves Liz asking her to wait for him and calls Farris and agrees to help her. But the problem with this is the terrorists already know who Chris is and obviously who Liz is and the second he walks away from her I suppose they would just walk in there and kidnap her all over again..a bit of a plot hole.",Next

294,munky_funky,This is a horrible movie,1,3 May 2007,"Let me list the many reasons I hate this movie. Let's first start with the blatant rip offs. First the opening credits start with the same splices of the city of Las Vegas and even the same song as the TV show Las Vegas. This piece of slime flick also steals from the classic ""A Clock Work Orange"" by prying the heroes eyes open with similar eye prying gizmos to force him to watch news clips instead of porn and violence. These are light offenses that might have been foregiven if not for the ending. The ending of this movie was one of the most unforgivable endings ever presented to film. I cant help but believe that the original ending was so denounced and such a utter failure with their preview audiences that they felt the need to cut off the last twenty minutes of the film. If this hasn't scared you from seeing the film, read no more. The surprise of whats to come might somehow impress you. Somehow, I hope you feel the same as me. Now I could concentrate my criticisms of this horrible film to all of its ridiculous aspects like how Cage's character decides to send all the troops to investigate one location while he searches all the rest, when he could have easily investigated them all and one of his troops ends up being killed. But I could have overlooking all of this films problems if not for the ending. I have never seen an ending that have caused more groans in an audience. This film didn't create just one ending groan, but two. The first occurs because everything that has occurred for the last 30 minutes is going to be repeated. The second occurred because the audience was confronted with the fact that the film just ended. This film is the equivalent of watching ""Ground Hogs Day"", only the secquence to get thru the day is something like 30 minutes of real time and the file ends after he awakes realizing that it still Ground Hogs Day. This film sucks.",Next
295,georgiamayj,Is this a comedy,2,13 February 2021,"I had to check several times that these reviews were written for the same movie that I watched...""Next"".
The first ten minutes were cool-then it became a cringefest. Jessica Beil is a lifeless doll. And Cage, he rolled her car and destroyed the nice Indigenous People's watertower. Moore is basically Clarice again but with dry sarcasm that's enabled by her cheeky partner.
Nothing in this film makes sense. I laughed a lot though. Nine stars out of ten - I would watch this again with friends and lots of alcohol.",Next
296,mvbirgelen,Nothing to see here; NEXT...,4,29 April 2007,"The summary of this movie: bad acting and a meaningless plot based upon clichés. This movie tries to combine the usual ""terrorist elements"" from movies such as ""The Sum of All Fears"" and a layer of ""sci-fi"" from ""Dejavu"" (how ironic). Also, there is some element of love and some action/chase/hostage/shooting and tings blowing up going around.Cris Johnson is an illusionist (The Prestige, The Illusionist anyone?) who has a very special gift. He can see things before they happen. The only problem is that this gift is somehow limited to just 2 minutes.Some evil terrorist group is trying to blow up a nuclear bomb somewhere in California. The FBI wants Johnsons special powers, but Johnson doesn't want the FBI. Aditionally, Johnsson falls in love with ""Liz"" (Jessica Biel, the beauty element) and vice versa, making things a bit more complicated all the way.Oh, and there is also a nice ending with some special effects and uh.. a deus ex machina optima forma is also present.The whole movie has no depth, is very unconvincing and just a waste of time.",Next
297,stevederomanet,Quite good,7,25 April 2007,"«Next» is certainly not a very good movie, the kind you have to have in your DVD Library.It's the last of a long series of novels written by Phillip K. Dick that have been put on screen. Don't think you are going to see a new «Blade Runner» or «Minority Report». The story take place in our time. The interest of the story line is the question : What can you do if you know the immediate future ? Is it fate or can you change it ?About the actors, Nicolas Cage is playing Nicolas Cage very well. Julianne Moore and Thomas Kretschmann are good and it's funny to see Peter Falk dressed even worst than in Columbo.I would have put a 5/10 to the film but Jessica Biel is perfect, and I don't mean only gorgeous, but her acting is good as well.Finally, I would say that I had some fun during 96 minutes.",Next

299,lambertsimnel,Hugely disappointing,4,18 February 2021,"Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite actors, and seeing that this was based on a Phillip K. Dick story I was looking forward to it. The film starts quite well with Nicholas Cage suitably portraying the jaded magician who can see two minutes ahead of his life, an idea that ought to have made an interesting film. Sadly the remainder of the film is badly glued together by a preposterous plot in which we are expected to accept without any explanation at all that a group of French people are plotting to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles. I can only suppose that it is Hollywood's stance that anybody who isn't American is therefore suspicious and likely to be up to no good. The plot has more holes than a string vest, and by the time the film reached its finale (which they no doubt thought was very smart but is merely daft) I had lost all interest in the characters and really couldn't care less what happened. Somewhere in this mess there is a good film struggling to get out, but unfortunately the bland script and fatuous plot prevent any chance of that happening. Shame.",Next

The premise is not unlike ""The Butterfly Effect"" and not surprisingly the effects are similar as well.Cage plays a very likable person and Biel is OK too but without any real depth. They are pretty superficial characters, really.The FBI agent (Moore) is the only character with any real grit - but is so arbitrarily different than all other agents and we are left wondering why, because nothing is revealed about her character. Everyone else kind of ""fade out"" and appear really peripheral to everything else - even the villains. We don't know why they have this idea to detonate a nuclear bomb in a major city and there isn't any one antagonist we can scowl at.Accepting the fact that precognition exists in a Las Vegas magician is also a little too easy. FBI concentrating all their resources of grabbing this one guy who may prevent the bomb going off is a little too thin.It's an OK but somewhat forgettable movie. Nothing really stands out in it but is predictable and comfortable.Cheers :-)",Next
301,andymcnish,Unexpectedly Good,9,27 March 2009,"I saw this movie on sale for a bargain £3. I had never heard of it, but Nicholas Cage is usually watchable, Lee Tamahori did the brilliant Once Were Warriors and the 'look 2 minutes into the future' Macguffin sounded intriguing enough; so I bought it and put it in the DVD player after dinner for myself and the wife to watch.It was really good and kept us both on the edge of our seats until the end (the ending was also very clever IMHO).Actually the best movie (along maybe with Watchmen) that I've seen this year.I imagine the pitch was something like 'Groundhog Day meets Die Hard', but for once they more or less pulled it off.They could have had a love interest with less of an age gap (but I assume Jessica Biel is there for eye candy not acting reasons) and the plot is a bit silly at times, but Cage plays it with just the right amount of 'tongue in cheek' as a lead in a paranormal action romance and compared with the last movie I sat and watched with my wife (the third Mummy) which is in a similar genre I suppose, this is in a different class.I can't really understand why so many folks give this really low ratings. Maybe it's real hard core action guys who dislike it, and it's probably not for them - but really this came as a very pleasant surprise. Highly recommended.",Next

I was yelling at the FBI throughout. Instead of using their resources to locate foreigners moving the heavy equipment needed to assemble the nuclear device, they think it will be easier to find one man who can see them coming. There appear to be dozens of people in this terrorist group, but somehow the plan is to find this one guy who can see 2 minutes into the future.Then, if they can get him to cooperate, their plan is to have him look 2 minutes into the future to see the detonation of the nuclear device and tell them where it happens. That is their plan. They are giving themselves 2 minutes to get to an unknown location in Los Angeles to stop a nuke. As we all know from previous movies, it takes 15 minutes to get anywhere in L.A.In a slight twist that I won't spoil here, they wind up having a bit more time, but they didn't know this when making their plan and using all their resources to find one guy.Also, the age difference between Cage and Biel is icky.

304,airelosse,Some of the Most fun I've had in a Theater in a Long Time,4,27 April 2007,"So what if that fun had nothing to do with the quality of the movie?First off, everyone but Nicholas Cage was useless. Julianne Moore (Hannibal, The Hours) was pointless, but not quite as much as Jessica Beil (The Illusionist). Neither contributed much to the film, but at least Moore's character was trying to do something plotwise. Beil, well, she was there to look good. And she did, more or less. Besides that, she contributed nothing but a distraction to a movie who's ""plot"" was rough enough.Oh yes, the plot. And i used the quotes for a reason. Apparently, there's a group of French-speaking, blond, Russian terrorists, none of whom you meet long enough to recognize or remember by name, planting a nuclear bomb (50 kiloton my ass.) in Los Angeles. And I'm not spoiling anything; the movie comes out and tells you this pretty early into it. So Moore, obsessed that Cage is the only one that can stop the bomb, somehow avoids being fired by her all too useless superiors and hunts him down. He's looking for Beil...only because he ""saw"" her once, important because it was more than the 2 minutes away he can normally see. Throw in some amateur philosophy talk about destiny, and we're half over.The next half is Cage and Moore running...Cage with the same face in every situation, as per usual. Then, end.A much more fitting end would've been: (Flashback to Cage in a casting agent's office): Cage - I'm sorry, but I've seen into this movie's future, and I see it failing miserably. Bye.But it was fun...if, and only if, you go with a group of people who fully recognize this is not something to be taken seriously.

It felt like you were still half way through when the credits suddenly pop up and it was all over. I knew the time was running short near the end, but until the last moment I was certain they would have some cool trick to tie it all up. After all, how could they do otherwise without ruining a perfectly good movie. Sure we saw a possible ending but that doesn't make up for not following through for the final ending. Did he find a way to stop the bad guys? Did he get back to the girl? Who knows? This was definitely a case of trying to be arty and cool at the expense of actually telling the story and in my case I feel that it ruined the whole experience. Big credit for doing a PKD film (even if only vaguely so). Great casting with Jessica Biel. It was really an excellent first rate movie right up until the credits rolled right in the middle of the story. No it wasn't confusing, not it wasn't disjointed, there was really nothing wrong with it except that it was half of a story. I give it 7 points because it was so good up until that moment.",Next

The plot consisted of a psychic Cage whose power allows him to see what's going to happen...Next. Originality. Of course, he tries to keep his power secret, until some government agency decides they'd like to recruit him to help uncover a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear weapon. What does this all-powerful psychic do? He runs. For most of the movie, he is fleeing from this agency that is trying to stave off a nuclear attack. Stand-up guy, this psychic. After a series of useless and time-consuming flashbacks which illustrate to all the ignorant viewers that Cage can see into the future (like we didn't know this already), the agency finds him. Barely putting up a fight after fleeing for an hour, he begins a search consisting of more flashbacks. The film seems to develop for a few minutes, then any latent gratitude is ripped away, and the viewer is left with the same crap from minutes earlier. This happens throughout the whole film.

While there have been a hundred movies about time travel, or precognition, this particular rendition is unique, and very refreshing.Nicholas Cage now has a very large body of work in his ever growing resume' of movies, and unfortunately, they have been a mixed bag of nuts at best. I would say that only about 60% of the movies he is in are truly worth watching, but that 60% are very good movies spanning serious roles, comedic, bad guy, good guy, weird guy, ghost, and everything else in-between!Nicholas is one of those actors that some how just him acting the same way, or just being himself in each movie just works. There are very few actors that can get away with this, and end up with the long careers that Nicholas has had. He has this way about him that is unique, and can just be used over and over and never seems to get old.""Next"" is a fun, and fast paced movie about a night club magician in Las Vegas who has an unusual act of guessing ""What will happen next."" The only difference with Nicholas's character, Chris Johnson, a.k.a Frank Cadillac, is that his act, is NOT an act. He actually has a real gift. Chris can see into the future a very short amount of time, but enough to where he can effect what happens to him, and his surroundings.The trouble all starts when an F.B.I. agent Callie Ferris (played by Julianne Moore) finds out about Chris's ability, and talks her superiors into letting her acquire his aid (whether he likes it or not) in trying to thwart a terrorist bomb attack on U.S. soil.Chris is able to escape the F.B.I.'s attempts to capture him several times with his love interest Liz Cooper (played by Jessica Biel) in tow by simply looking into the future in just enough time to see what their plans are, and precisely at the right moment slip through their fingers.Eventually the F.B.I. does catch up with him, but not before pulling an amazing split second rescue of the main F.B.I. agent Callie. There is no real way to describe in words how Chris pulls these stunts off, but the people in charge of the C.G.I. do a fantastic job. One particular scene that is really mind bending, is towards the end of the movie when Chris, Liz, Callie, and a team of F.B.I. agents are stumbling through a warehouse trying to locate this bomb planted by the terrorist group, and the camera shows Chris splitting himself up in the future a hundred different ways searching through the warehouse trying to avoid booby trap type bombs set to blow up if someone walks past them.This is about as far as I can take you with regards to the plot without playing the spoiler, so I will end on this note. Director Lee Tamahori, does manage to pull of a very good over all ""look"" and ""feel"" to the movie, and overall the movie was very entertaining. I think if they were to kick things up a notch, they could easily pull off a sequel that would overshadow the first.My rating for this movie is 7.50 out of 10.00Check out my Movie, DVD, and Book review blog http://watchnread.blogspot.com/",Next

There are a few plot tears. For example, wouldn't his 2 minute future looking into thing just stay at two minutes as time went along. so when Julianne Moore, who really is fairly straight forward and didn't really try to act too much in this movie, was trying to get Nicholas cage drugged wouldn't the whole wait two minutes thing not work, just because as time is ongoing so is his two minutes ahead thing? that probably didn't make any sense.

But in reality they were thinking they were going to be seeing something much different, maybe spider-man 3 or something, who knows. At no point was this movie hailed as having 250 million dollar budget. The acting was fair, come on can't have people acting legitimate in a science fiction movie. Most go, wouldn't the Fed's go other routes, this my friend is a movie, made for entertainment purposes. Want the real raw deal, go to the non-fiction section. The term fiction to me means not real. So get over that. The effects are good at all points till the barge which is not all that. The producers could have gone with another actress to play the love interest, or given her more to go with. The movie did play her as desperate seeing how she slept with our star so quickly. But it is a 90 minute movie format, so you can't draw it out. The chemistry between the two is also not in the ""best I've seen"" category. When together they didn't seem to mesh well, and the scene did feel kinda not there. Okay, now for this two minute nonsense I have been reading about. The rules never change, they are the same. He can just manipulate his ability, and maybe he just never pushed himself before to do all those cool tricks, Plus, not many endings can we say that we really have no idea how it ends, got an idea, but like he says at the end, once you look at the future it changes, thats not a spoiler, thats fact. Instance of that is me telling you that the road is wet, you will than slow down instead of speeding. That is how this film ends, shows you one way it could, completely void of the real ending. Its Nice. I would see it again. Not a lot of drama (thank goodness), good action (about time). You want effects to go ""wow"" at wait till May 4th. The ending was kind of abrupt,just thrown in your face. And when you are sitting there watching the credits run backwards you feel ripped off. Than you think, if they did it all over again it would not be interesting, based off all the stuff he did initially before his time jump back (mentally) you can gather that he will win at saving the girl, and the state of New York, because now his girlfriend is out of danger. The ending also leaves the movie open for a sequel or maybe a back door pilot deal for some network. Who knows. Anyway, that's my deal. Hope it helps. Here is my closing, when complaining about the reality of some science fiction movie and the how's and the why's and the that would never happen. Remember that its just a movie, and is fake. People take movies so literal, almost like the word of God. It is not, and should never happen. When did going to a movie have to be so difficult. Most critics butcher all the good ones and appraise the horrible ones, that is because if they didn't no one would see it. Simple as that. The most worst movies, or boring movies always get the top prizes. Come on now.

The beginning is promising (the casino scene is great! ) , but after that is slowing down. I also found the script a little bit ""empty"". I understand i can't say any details from here, but i have so many whys about the story. Nicholas Cage's character is too depressed , (for no reason, in my opinion ), and i don't understand exactly why he is so negative about helping. There is no explanation about the bond between Cage and Jennifer Biel (in the beginning or in the end ), and more, between Julian Moore and him. Why is she so stuck to him? Just her instinct? I guess , the humanity or CIA is has more useful things to do. Reading my comments, i know i could rate the film, worse than 6. But i always liked the idea of returning back in time, or stop the ""clock"" , Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite, and, in the end, it was a pleasant film. But nothing more...",Next

And though Nicolas Cage is not the greatest actor alive, he makes the main character somewhat likable. The twist at the end may be a big disappointment for some, but I actually quite liked it. Julianne Moore never disappoints and Jessica Biel is hot. The action scenes are well shot and the ever evolving gimmick of Nick's future sight is brought convincingly. Two of the best action scenes, those in the casino and the one near the end are very cleverly brought to life.

It sounds a little thin and dumb - and that's equally what is is.The first couple of minutes is OK, but as soon as the story begins to take form, the quality vanishes. First this: Cage's hair is dyed black and cut to make him look completely idiotic together with a silly skin color (orange?). Cage is a good actor, but he has nothing to work with as his lines are cheap and filled with cliché's. Enter Jessica Beal, who for some reason is considered an actor. Looking like she could be Cage's daughter, Beal plays a grown up woman that Cage falls in love with. The biggest blow to the gut, and the biggest disappointment, is to see Moore play an FBI-agent that has nothing but stupid comments to stupid situations.Some of the newest technology has been put into this movie, but somewhere in the process the script was forgotten, and the story is nowhere interesting. The bandits - some french speaking men and a woman - are never portrait so the viewer gets to believe that there actually is a story going on, and at no time do you get the feeling that there is an actually story going on. All that matters is the special FX when Cage sees into the future.This is probably the worst movie in Cage's career, definitely the worst in Moore's, but precisely the level Beal will stay on for the rest of her wide screen life.",Next

The action is not overwhelming, and all the scenes are well done. The best part of all is that, unlike most movies these days, the previews don't give away every good scene. Given, the previews give away almost all of the entire plot, but we are talking about the same author who wrote Minority Report. So, why not a 10? The only downside would have to be that some of the acting is not as good as you would hope. Jessica Biel is not unconvincing as a love interest, but she's not entirely convincing. The plot is somewhat predictable, but there are surprises. Don't forget, this is an ACTION film. Not a romantic comedy; not a love story. It serves its point as an action film, and it serves it well.

Chris Johnson is gifted psychically, but neither wants nor understands why he's the way he is, and in many ways, just wants to be left alone. He portrays that inner conflict, confusion, and compulsion fairly well and comes across with the ""charming yet odd"" persona that myself and a lot of my friends ""like that"" seem to have.The movie has a few good twists and turns, and uses humor in a few places to make fun of the situation, and even for those who aren't in the know that way, it's still a fun movie to see.",Next
336,williams-kelsey,Already seen what comes Next...,3,7 May 2007,"Watching the ridiculous mess of plot holes and absurdity that is Lee Tamahori's Next invariably makes us wish we could see two-hours into the future to deem this movie a waste of time before we sit down to watch it. A slipshod work of Hollywood cliché, Next, pretends to be an interesting psychological action film trying to leave us wondering about the ""what-if's"" the movie proposes, when it actually only leaves us wondering how in heavens name any producer could expect us to believe that a middle-aged Nic Cage with bad hair could land Jessica Biel. Without any heart or spirit, this film relies on big bangs and a hot girl to bring the pre-pubescent boys out to spend their allowance at the box office. Nicolas Cage, who has previously shown some signs of promise in films like Leaving in Las Vegas and Adaptation, falls even further from his former place in our esteem with his latest in a succession of cruddy movies. Hey, at least this latest entry into the club of dismal Cage doesn't ask us to believe that his head bursts into flame as he rides a motorcycle, just that he can miraculously see the future, and with this power duplicate himself, dodge bullets, avoid booby traps, and save the day all while standing in one place looking more like he has a blockage in his bowels than a blockage in his clairvoyance. Actually, come to think of it, we might prefer the flaming skull-head. After this latest installment in his addiction to bad films, we all have almost lost hope that he will go back to working on his acting rather than on his abs (which were amply visible the couple times Cage took off his shirt). One must feel sorry for Jessica Biel and Julianne Moore, as so very little is given to them in the comic-strip writing of their characters that we can hardly be surprised when the performances come out flat and cliché. In fact, it is worth pondering, what in this movie is not cliché? The nuclear/chemical/biological weapon that was stolen by terrorists and now must be found before ""8 million people die""? Nope, The Sum of All Fears, XXX, and The Peacemaker are just a few of the bevy of post-cold war movies focusing on what happens if the weapons from the build up land in the wrong hands. Maybe the hard-ass but essentially well meaning federal agent, willing to do anything to for the greater good? The Bourne Identity and most CIA or FBI based films. So, how about the clever crane shot of Las Vegas with blinding neon and the tune of Elvis Presley's ""A Little Less Conversation""? Nope, Ocean's Eleven for one beat them to that one. How about the neat bullet dodging effect? Nope, The Matrix. That nifty little tool used to keep Nic Cage's eyelids open? No, A Clockwork Orange did it first. How about the concept of a guy knowing the future and thus knowing exactly where to be at exactly the right time? Sorry, that was Groundhog Day. The major dilemma of whether to sacrifice the individual for the common good? Um let's see, nearly all superhero movies most notably Spiderman and Batman Begins. Then there's also Good Will Hunting and the list goes on. How about the potentially mind-boggling ending that reveals it's all been a dream/ look into the future? There are too many to list. For the most part the film looks entirely Hollywood with whiffs of an attempt at pulpy, arty shots in which Cage is in sharp focus surrounded by an intense blur, supposedly to suggest that only Chris Johnson has a clear view of the world that to others is so blurry. But we're not fooled by the soft, all too obvious attempts at cinematic metaphor because the emblematic Hollywood action sequences with the CGI SUV's and log trucks falling from the sky or in an odd greenly lit warehouse make it abundantly clear that what may appear to be artistic attempts (albeit weak ones) in the film were bastardized by their connection with the omnipresent Hollywood conventions. Therefore, the shots that might be trying to have significance start to look like a director's obsession with sharp close-ups. The music was overpowering and didactic. Every note gave away exactly what was to happen next, if we didn't already know from seeing innumerable similar action plots prior to this one. The dialogue was strained, often ludicrous, and, of course, previously done: ""I have seen every possible ending, and none of them are good for you,"" ""There's something I have to do, and I can't put it off any longer."" Not to mention the tragically botched punch-line of the old Zen hot dog joke, ""I'll have one with everything."" For the edification of those of us who have not had the joy to hear the actual joke, the Zen Buddhist says to the hot dog vendor, ""Make me one with everything."" With such uninspired writing, we would love to ask, did anyone bother to edit or did they expect this whorey slop to pass for actual discourse?There's something bitterly ironic that in a film entitled Next, there is absolutely no original ideas or circumstances. However, it does work in a way probably completely unintentionally; we, like Chris Johnson, knew everything that was coming, we just didn't have the happy ability to know we knew what was coming and avoid it. What else is there to say but, next please.***This review was written somewhat in reference to the style and voice of Pauline Kael",Next

The answer is no No matter who you are .the important thing is you can fight for love. A man with an excellent ability to see future saved other lives. And saved his love. Yes Nicolas Cage with an Oscar worthy performance showed us how Cris Johnson saved other lives after his refusal. And after a dream. That he felt he may lose his love, (and actually he didn't do that just for his love and he saved other lives too and he showed that hi is lovely enough to do this for all) his valuable love that he didn't reach it just by seeing future. And he accepted to do it all without any wrangle. The important thing I've learned from this excellent movie was that we can do everything possible for saving other lives and especially for our loves undoubted. And I really thanks to the visual effects supervisor for the great scenes at the movie. And in general it was great at its kind for sure. And this film is involved to the kind of films must see for no doubt. And I think this movie must see for many time not just one time. And think about its container.

It came across like she was women, hear her roar and now she will go home and take care of the kids and of course breastfeed while being a bad ass. The best part of the night was the drink and nachos that I ate before the movie and the popcorn during.",Next
361,scook542,Entertaining but still disappointing,4,29 April 2007,"I'm in a marching band, and we recently went on a trip where they took us to a private screening of this movie. We were all dead tired, but I still remember the experience of watching this movie. The only real reason this movie gets a 4 is because of how cool it was to see him dodge bullets and punches 'cause he knew they were coming. Other than that, it was rather dry and boring. It's probably due to the fact that the thought behind the movie is: ""Oh hey, you can see two minutes into the future! Good that means you can help the FBI try and stop some stereotypical foreign terrorists who want to blow up a nuclear weapon they managed to steal!"" At the end of the movie when he wakes up to a place back almost half way through the movie we all groaned at the thought of having to watch that much more of it(just shows how much we enjoyed that movie... that was sarcasm just in case you didn't catch that) I'm not really a big fan of Nicholas Cage, and again I didn't really like him in this movie. I wish I could go back in time and get back that time for much needed sleeping though, as i honestly could have lived happily without seeing that. If you have nothing better to do, then fine, it's entertaining enough. If you're expecting something cool and exciting(which would surprise me), then you're in for a surprise.",Next
362,nate_mckay,Another rip off,2,8 October 2007,"Action films these days only seem to get worse and worse. What bothered me about this film was the simple, boring, predictable storyline. It was so basic, so overused that to me it just wasn't interesting.Synopsis: A Russian terrorist group tries to detonate a nuclear bomb. A man who can see two minutes in the future will stop them.Wow. My grandmother could have come up with something better than that. First of all, Nicholas Cage just sucks as an actor. He's just so boring, so plain that I really can't appreciate his skills. He always plays the same exact character with the same exact plot line. The last movie i saw with him was national treasure, which involved him with another beautiful women caught up in his plans to save the world, while eventually falling in love with him.The action scenes were appalling. Not only did the movie completely try to rip off the style of The Matrix where he dodges the snipers shot. At the end of the film where he dodges every shot it was a complete rip off from the matrix. Everything was just bad.",Next
363,nelsonpatrick,You will be able to see much farther than 2 minutes into this movie's future.,1,25 April 2007,"I saw this movie at a sneak peak today. I did not pay for it, but I still feel cheated.Cris has the supernatural ability to see into the future. But only for two minutes, and only for himself. Naturally, the Government wants to harness this into a weapon to fight the terrorists. Cris just wants to sleep with Jessica Biel.The movie's script is contrived, derivative, and boring. The action sequences are trite and nonsensical. The characters are two-dimensional cutouts. There are no real performances in this movie; it appears that the actors were merely told to read off a television prompt. At times you will find yourself laughing at the unintentionally bad dialog. The plot holes left are large enough to fit elephants through. Don't think too much about it, blood may shoot out your nose.Even if you incur no monetary cost by seeing this movie, it is still a waste; your time will be better spent doing almost anything else.",Next
364,nswan-2,Intelligent and Imaginative,9,6 May 2007,"Next manages to manipulate time without the usual film flaws: a credit to the Director, Editor, and writers. The story line includes intrigue, romance, adventure, and even a touch of comedy. The performances are not extraordinary, but it works well enough in spite of this (characters could have been developed a little more): Nicholas Cage is pure ""Cage""; Jessica Biel's performance almost makes us forget Mary Camden; and, Julianne Moore does well as an FBI agent: overall, very entertaining. I was on the edge of my seat throughout most of the movie. The best thing about the movie, however, could easily be the intelligent and satisfying ending...",Next
