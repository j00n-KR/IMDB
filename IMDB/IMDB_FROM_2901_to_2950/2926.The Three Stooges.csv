0,MartinHafer,"I should be ashamed of myself, but I found myself laughing as I watched this one!",7,18 August 2012,"Although I have possibly reviewed more films from the Criterion Collection and PBS than any other person on IMDb, I am not such a fathead that I can't let myself watch some less than intellectual fare. And it certainly doesn't get any less intellectual than ""The Three Stooges""--a surprisingly good film provided you have realistic expectations. I say realistic because you CAN'T expect a film like this to be Shakespeare! And here is the rub...I really liked it! Seriously. While I would never recommend you go to the theater to watch it or even buy the film, it's well worth renting or seeing when it comes to cable TV.One of the best things about this film is that the Farrelly Brothers tried hard to get the look and sound right in the film. I also REALLY appreciate that unlike many Farrelly Brother films, it's very family-friendly and you don't need to be embarrassed to have your kids see it. However, this does not mean that it's pablum. The film has a few dark (but funny) moments and a few PG rated remarks--as well as referring to one of the nuns as 'Sister Mary-Mengele' (who was played by a guy). Overall, this is a film that is not brilliant but is quite good for what it is--an ultra-silly film with low-brow humor that will make you laugh despite how low the humor is.By the way, in addition to seeing the cast of Jersey Shore (and although I can't stand them, using them worked here), you get to see Isaiah Mustafa (the Old Spice Guy) and Emy Coligado (Piama from ""Malcolm in the Middle"") in small parts--which is kind of interesting to see. Also at the end is a VERY dull little message to kids telling him that all the stunts were fake and bonking people for real is dangerous and BAD. Just speed past this--it's really preachy....plus, it's just a bit of silly cartoon-like violence.UPDATE: A couple months after I watched this, my wife watched it again with me and she laughed repeatedly. She felt ashamed of herself, but she definitely laughed!",The Three Stooges
1,bkoganbing,"Some Ersatz Stooges, NYUK, NYUK",6,18 April 2012,"Watching The Three Stooges movie for the new century I got the impression I was watching one giant tribute show, something along the lines of James Whitmore doing Harry Truman. Maybe Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and Chris Diamantopoulos might do just that and take a live show on the road should this film prove successful.As The Three Stooges back in the day did their work at Columbia Pictures I was wondering why Columbia instead of 20th Century Fox did this particular film. But who am I to complain as these ersatz caricatures did a reasonably good job at imitating the originals.The Stooges start out as boys with three kids doing imitations of them, they were left as foundling babies at a Catholic orphanage. As they grow up they never leave the nest, Moe almost gets adopted but turns it down saying they're a package deal. Nobody wanted that particular package and they took an altogether different kid.Evil times befall the orphanage and the Stooges go out into the world looking to raise $800,000.00+ to pull the orphanage from debt. On the way they save the life of the kid who was adopted in Moe's place and who has grown up to be Kirby Heyborne. Do you doubt the orphanage was saved in Stooge fashion of course. Some definite changes come into place there.Special mention should go to Larry David who played the nun who was the special target, even inadvertently of Stooges mayhem. He steals every scene he's in with The Three Stooges.Young audiences might appreciate this film, a chance to become acquainted with a true American institution. Hopefully they will check out the real deal as well.",The Three Stooges
2,SnoopyStyle,Farrellys does Stooges,6,16 August 2013,"Larry (Sean Hayes), Curly (Will Sasso), and Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) are the Three Stooges. The Farrelly brothers takes on this high risk project with little possible rewards. If it goes wrong, the Farrellys will be ridiculed (as they do from some quarters). And how much reward would they get for making a Three Stooges movie anyways? In general, the three guys do a great mimicry job. The story starting with the orphanage which had good heart. The main problem is the oddball murder plot. It's way too serious to do slap sticks on. All in all, these are likable characters and they have good fun. The Farrelly brothers comedic credentials survives another day.",The Three Stooges
3,Prismark10,"Slap, punch and tickle",6,2 September 2013,"On paper I would be wary of a Three Stooges film, outside of the USA they were an unknown quantity.Younger viewers would be unaware of them and their silly antics.The Farrelly Brothers are known for their slapstick comedies with the added twist of bad taste.This film works surprisingly well. The three leads get into the roles with gusto although the plot is silly and sporadically funny.Kids would actually enjoy this and the film is broken down in three parts so it plays like three shorts of the Three Stooges.However it does not have the freshness and zaniness of Dumb and Dumber.",The Three Stooges
4,nogodnomasters,Say a few parables,8,14 February 2018,"I grew up a fan of the Stooges. I will acknowledge that they can only be imitated and never duplicate, especially Curly. While I didn't want to enjoy this film, I found myself laughing in the beginning at the first gag when an infant's stooge fingers came out of a sack and ""doinked"" the nun in the eyes. The young stooges were also a treat as they were able to imitate the famous gags and lines. One had to have some familiarity with the Stooges to catch the humor such as when they tried to revive a nun by gently slapping her (Larry David) on the face and saying ""Say a few parables"" instead of their normal ""Say a few syllables"" line. Yes, I thought that was funny. I also enjoyed the the way they used their titles and sign names as puns the way the original Stooges did in their famous lawyers ""Dewey Cheatam, and Howe"" now used in ""Car Talk"" gag credits.There were scenes that worked and some that didn't work. Sean Hayes as Larry was the weakest of the three, perhaps because his head was too thin. There were some lines that they missed. Instead of ""Where are your manners?"" they should have used ""Where's your Emily Post."" When Curly spins around on the floor, that needs to be sped up slightly. It doesn't work in real time. The big to-do about Kate Upton in a hot nun's swim suit last about 3 seconds near the end of the film. If you are not a serious Stooge fan, you should wait for the rental.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",The Three Stooges
5,kosmasp,Stooges reloaded,6,18 September 2012,"Right from the start you can see that the filmmakers and everyone else involved are big fans of the original Stooges. While there is a sad story behind the guys who played the Stooges back in the day (Empire Magazine ran a story about that, I'm sure you can find it somewhere on the internet too), this takes the spirit of the movies (and shorts) and tries to bring them as faithful as possible to our time.Of course the Stooges are never fully embarked in the present. They're always behind in so many things and still the ones you will root for the most. While there was a Stooges movie in talks with big star names (Jim Carrey being one of them, forgot the other two names), I think they found a good cast to play the Stooges. Plus the supporting cast is good too (Larry David, Sofia Vergara and more). I guess this is as good a Stooges movie as we are about to get ...",The Three Stooges
6,ccthemovieman-1,Not Bad; Kudos To The Actors,8,18 July 2012,"As a longtime fan of The Three Stooges, I realized would not be not easy to live up to screen legends like that. I found out all three actors did a nice job, and the only one who seemed off a bit was ""Larry"" who didn't sound like the real Larry. The guy who played Moe probably looked, sounded and acted the closest to the real Stooge. He looked like an older Moe of the early '50s. Man, since the actor was young, he must have had a ton of makeup on - but it worked.The second half of the film was better, in my opinion, than the first. Overall, it was the worth the rental, and I would watch it again down the road. They had many of the Stooges jokes and sight gags through the years. One weird thing was they had a man playing an old, crabby nun. That was a bit over-the-top.",The Three Stooges
7,moonspinner55,"Not especially well-made, but funny, colorfully cast, and pared down to an appropriate length...",6,15 April 2012,"The Farrelly Brothers, Bobby and Peter (who directed and also co-wrote the screenplay with Mike Cerrone), put their stamp on the Three Stooges phenomenon--as popular today as it ever was. Their film is predictably full of violent physical slapstick and sight-gags, but it has a certain maniacal-yet-breezy charm, and is well-cast in the bargain. Three babies are literally dumped on the doorstep of a Catholic orphanage; 25 years on, the rambunctious trio--Larry, Moe, and Curly--have missed their chances at being adopted and have become incompetent handymen for the resident nuns. It isn't clear if the Stooges are meant to be related, nor are the Farrellys concerned with keeping this scenario on somewhat-realistic ground (the Stooges age from infants to boys to men, but the nuns never change). Taking the accident-prone threesome out into the real world for the first time (to raise money for their financially-strapped orphanage home) smacks a bit of ""The Brady Bunch Movie"", and the pathos involving a dying girl are unwelcomed, though the laughs are certainly there. Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and the amazingly accurate Chris Diamantopoulos carry the film, though even their gung-ho charisma can't save a feel-good finale which drags its feet, not to mention a poor tie-in to MTV's ""Jersey Shore"", complete with prolonged cameos by its orange-tanned cast. The cinematography is ungainly, and most of the writing is disappointing, however the film is kept to a reasonable length (92 minutes) and features some wild gags and big laughs. **1/2 from ****",The Three Stooges
8,tavm,This depiction of The Three Stooges in a modern day setting portrayed by other actors is a fun tribute to them,8,14 April 2012,"You know, when I read that Peter and Bobby Farrelly were going to make a movie starring actors impersonating The Three Stooges, I was a little skeptical especially when the announced stars were people like Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro. But they calmed down and instead cast actors like Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and Chris Diamantopoulos who did fine in acting exactly like Larry, Curly, and Moe, respectively, when portraying the legendary comics. And while there's somewhat of a sentimental plot involving some orphan kids, it never goes in treacly territory as there's always some wonderfully staged slapstick scenes that undercuts that. Oh, and there's also some hilarious scenes involving the cast of ""Jersey Shore"". In summary, this version of The Three Stooges is highly recommended for anyone not minding seeing this legendary comedy team played by other actors or anyone who haven't even heard of them yet and wants to see more of them.",The Three Stooges
9,edwagreen,Back to a Modern '30s -3 Stooges ***,7,7 January 2013,"The three guys who portrayed the memorable trio looked just like their real counterparts. It was wonderful being brought back to their era no less than in color as well.The story, in three vignettes, traces their life back to an orphanage, adulthood and finally a funny situation where they rescue a former fellow orphan from his wife and her lover. The ending is most shocking and hilarious.Naturally, the slapstick comedy is non-stop. Larry David steals the show as a cruel nun who badgers the 3 guys during a 25 year period.Jennifer Hudson plays a nun who attempts to belt out some songs in this often hilarious spoof of a golden age.",The Three Stooges
10,LeonLouisRicci,The Reboot...Hits and Misses,5,28 August 2012,"The Three Stooges characters and the slapstick schtick they imitate are dead on impressive and truly a modern recreation and indicative of the obvious love and respect that the filmmakers have for the absolutely unique format the Stooges created. Moe, Larry, and Curly have been reborn and the sad part is that they had to be put in this post-modern display of bathroom humor and the awful TV ""reality"" shows. While hitting, slapping, gouging, poking, and beating each other what must have been a million times over the years, not once did the boys ever aim below the belt. Religion has no place in the wacky world of The Three Stooges. This and the aforementioned are an obvious attempt to please today's moviegoers and is not in the spirit and specialty that the comedy team invented. Were the Director's so afraid that kids today would find the original comedy so dated that all that superfluous stuff was needed? Did they really have such little faith in the timeless quality of superb slapstick, that they had to spew bodily elimination, instead of seltzer, to get a laugh? How about a pie in the face, or motor oil (that could be a modern statement) instead of a warm yellow liquid.",The Three Stooges
11,writers_reign,Trio con Brio,7,28 August 2012,"Like most people who going to movies on a regular basis I'm familiar with the original Three Stooges if only from the 'Saturday Morning' kids programmes of my childhood. They were recycling Three Stooges shorts made years earlier and they were reasonably funny as far as slapstick goes. The movie seems to be a faithful and loving recreation of the group. The lookalikes are not going to fool any real aficianados but they ARE lookalikes as well as behavealikes so that the idiosyncrasies of all three are captured faithfully. You don't, of course, expect much in the way of plot but perversely the producers have thrown one in which sees the trio attempting to raise, against ridiculous not to say astronomical odds, $300,000 to save the orphanage in which they were raised. What can I tell you, they perform their schtick; if you're susceptibly you'll laugh; if not, you've wasted ninety minutes.",The Three Stooges
12,zardoz-13,"Sorry ""Stooges"" Saga",5,22 April 2012,"If you've never seen a ""Three Stooges"" comic short or any of their feature length comedies, the Farrelly Brothers' farce is an awful way to acquaint yourself with Moe, Curly, and Larry. Indeed, it is difficult to believe the same guys who created ""There's Something about Mary"" and ""Kingpin"" concocted this sophomoric comedy. Unlike the television biography that Mel Gibson produced about the Three Stooges back in 2000, the Brothers Farrelly wanted to revive the fictional morons rather than chronicle their real-life counterparts. Further, the Farrellys decided to let the ""Stooges"" wreck havoc in a contemporary setting. Basically, the Farrellys cannot rekindle the comic genius of these maniac Jewish comics who acquired a reputation for poking eyes, slapping heads, and twisting noses. Sadly, the laughs are few and far between. This $30 million imitation of the Three Stooges qualifies as half-baked. Juveniles may giggle at the geysers of urine, but neither the Farrellys nor the new Stooges are a third as funny as the originals. Chiefly known for their crude movies, the Farrellys usually get a PG-13 or an R-rating for vulgar content. ""The Three Stooges"" marks their first PG-13 release. This PG-rating covers violent slapstick action and some rude and suggestive humor, including language. Meanwhile, the Farrellys give the eponymous threesome every opportunity to slap, punch, and gouge each other. Every ""Three Stooges"" movie is a comedy of errors. Before the dust settles, the trio has inflicted enough pain and injury on each other to land them in the emergency room. The stupidity that these three display in their best efforts to perform a task is side-splitting. The best scene the Farrellys conjure up occurs in a hospital newborn ward. The Stooges juggle babies, and the infants empty their bladders on them in a shower of urine. Were this not enough, the Farrellys convinced the cast of the hit reality TV show ""Jersey Shore"" to suffer the wrath of Moe. Watching Moe reprimand the ""Jersey Shore"" regulars is entertaining. Most of the other gags in ""The Three Stooges"" have a Rube Goldberg quality. When they try to remove a bell from a roof, the Stooges lose the head of a sledge hammer. The sledge head flies off into a water bucket. The last thing that happens in that scene involves the use of that particular water bucket. The person intending to refresh another doesn't know about its' contents. Sean Hayes, Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos do a credible job of impersonating Larry, Curly and Moe. The complicated material that ""Me, Myself & Irene"" scenarist Mike Cerrone and the Farrellys serve up defeat their efforts. ""The Three Stooges"" unfolds in three back-to-back episodes, each slightly longer than the Columbia Pictures shorts. The Farrellys and Cerrone have treated this ""Stooges"" saga as an 'origins' film. They provide some background about the trio. The protagonists appear as children in the first episode and later predominantly as adults in the second and third episodes. Believe me; nothing in any of these three episodes will have you in stitches. ""The Three Stooges"" resembles an inferior pilot for a proposed television series. Our threesome land on the front steps of the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage after a car careens up and a duffel bag flies out the window. The first nun to inspect the duffel, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David of ""Seinfeld""), takes two fingers in the eyes and topples backwards off the steps. Eventually, Sister Mary-Mengele becomes their chief adversary. If the name Mengele sounds familiar, Nazi Josef Mengele was the notorious SS Officer who presided over the destiny of prisoners at Auschwitz. Anyway, Sister Mary doesn't cut them any slack. Another nun follows up and finds three infants in the duffel. They look like tyke-sized replicas of the adult Moe, Larry, and Curly. Mother Superior (Jane Lynch of ""Role Models"") and the sisters try to trick a gullible husband and wife, the Harters (Stephen Collins of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and Carley Craig of ""The Heartbreak Kid"") into adopting Moe. Rather than letting the prospective parents see every child, the sisters trot out just the Three Stooges. When it appears the nuns have fooled the Harters into taking the trio off their hands, another child, Teddy (Jake Peck), enters the room by accident. The trio end up stuck at the orphanage for life. Twenty-five years later, they are still living at the Sisters of Mercy. Moe (newcomer Chris Diamantopoulos with a distinctive bowl-shaped haircut) emerges as the boss of the bunch. Larry (Sean Hayes of ""The Bucket List""), Curly (Will Sasso of ""Southland Tales""), and Moe perform chores for the sisters. As a consequence of the Stooges' audacious exploits, the orphanage cannot afford its insurance premiums. Monsignor Ratliffe (Brian Doyle-Murray of ""Caddyshack"") shows up to warn the Mother Superior about this crisis. They have about a month before they must close the orphanage. Ratliffe tells the Stooges that $830-thousand is required to save the place. The remainder of this shallow comedy concerns the cockeyed antics of the Stooges as they struggle to obtain that $830-thousand. The obstacles they face are well-nigh insurmountable. Furthermore, these knuckle-heads are completely clueless about how they can save the day. Quite by accident, they encounter Lydia (Sofía Vergara of ""Four Brothers"") and her shady boyfriend Mac (Craig Bierko of ""Sour Grapes"") as they are searching for somebody to kill her husband. Of course, the Stooges think that Mac is married to Lydia. In reality, Lydia is married to grown-up Teddy (Kirby Heyborne of ""Saints and Soldiers"") the kid from the orphanage. Mac convinces them that he wants to die and they plan his demise. When Lydia offers our numbskulls $830-thousand, they prepare to let blood.""The Three Stooges"" looks like the Farrellys made it for elementary school age kids. You'd be better off watching any of the 190 genuine ""Three Stooges"" comic shorts or their six feature length films. Worst, ""The Three Stooges"" rates as the worst Farrellys' movie ever.",The Three Stooges
13,grantss,Meh,4,27 September 2020,"Not as bad as I expected, but still misses the mark. Has some great laugh-out-loud moments, but is mostly pretty lame. Really doesn't do the Three Stooges brand much favours.",The Three Stooges
14,Boba_Fett1138,"Not bad, it just didn't really ever made me laugh.",6,18 April 2012,"Honestly, I really like good old fashioned slapstick humor but the slapstick in this movie just never really made me laugh. But having said that, it's still not a bad movie and it certainly isn't as bad as most people were anticipating it to be.So the good news about this movie is that it's not being anything too bad or lame. And really, that still is the most positive thing I took out of this movie. The beauty and power of slapstick, in my opinion is, is that you often can see the joke coming from miles away already but it still can make you laugh real hard because it all got done so extremely well and perfectly executed and delivered, by its director and actors. That just isn't ever the case with this movie. You can see the jokes coming from miles away and it's all being very predictable and not executed in such a way that it ever made me laugh.It still all makes the movie maintaining and entertaining to watch though. Even though the story is incredibly simplistic and the movie often was simply repeating itself, I never got bored with it. I still did wish for some more original stuff to happen in it though. Slapstick movies are some of the most creative movies out there. Something I can't really say for this movie.It probably still is true that lovers of the classic 'Three Stooges' will still get a bigger kick and laugh out of this movie. They might be able to recognize some inside jokes and references, which I all clearly missed. And it's not like Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes and Will Sasso were bad as the 'Three Stooges' but they clearly were playing caricatures of the three classic characters, which is something I just don't like very much.Well, it's watchable enough all but I doubt it will mark the revival of the classic slapstick genre. I'm still giving it really the benefit of the doubt and I'm still interested in seeing were they are going to take the characters and its comedy to, in some possible sequels.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Three Stooges
15,george.schmidt,Farrellys' valentine to our favorite trio of knuckleheads is fun for the most part,7,16 April 2012,"THE THREE STOOGES (2012) **1/2 Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, Chris Diamantopoulos, Jane Lynch, Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Hudson, Craig Bierko, Stephen Collins, Larry David, Kirby Heyborne, Carly Craig, Kate Upton, Brian Doyle-Murray (Cameos: The cast of ""THE REAL WORLD"" as themselves). The Farrelly Brothers' valentine to the violent prone vaudevillian classic comedy team of Moe, Larry & Curly (well-enthused & highly energetic dopplegangers Diamantopoulos, Hayes and Sasso) starts as an origin story that dovetails into a save the orphanage romp with the dim-witted trio out to stop foreclosure on their beloved home by forcing themselves into 'the real world' and finding themselves ensnared in a dubious murder-for-hire scheme (don't ask). While the thin screenplay by Bobby & Peter (and collaborator Mike Cerrone) is weak in its premise it's the greatest hits (literally!) of the comedy team's pokes, boinks and bone-crushing interplays with one another is a true delight to rekindle even if it will more than likely prompt you (and justifiably) to seek out the originals' videos to watch in the comfort of your own home.",The Three Stooges
16,anaconda-40658,For Stooges Fans.,6,3 June 2015,"The Three Stooges (2012): Dir: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Cast: Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, Sofia Vergara, Jane Lynch: Based on the classic slapstick films featuring three distinct individuals whose methods evolve around clumsiness, pratfalls, and total absence of mind. Three babies are dropped off at an orphanage run by nuns but they grow to adulthood there because any attempts to have them adopted are met with chaos. When the orphanage is threatened to be closed down, the three carefree guys who are known as Moe, Larry and Curly set out on the road in hopes of raising the money needed. They receive an offer from a woman who wants her husband knocked off but they soon recognize her husband as someone who grew up at the orphanage. Peter and Bobby Farrelly deserve credit for creating what may be the best crack at a Stooges film that can be had. This does not rank with their best work, which includes There's Something About Mary and Kingpin, mainly due to simplistic plotting, formula storytelling and an ending that hams up the sentimentalism. What does work is three pitch perfect performances by Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe, Sean Hayes as Larry, and Will Sasso as Curly. They embody the mannerisms and physical gestures with extreme hilarity. Supporting roles are standard cardboard including Sofia Vergara as the villain out to get her hands on her husband's cash. Jane Lynch plays Mother Superior but unfortunately the role is not as superior as her talent deserves. While not very demanding, this film delivers a respectful tribute to the classic trio.

17,FlashCallahan,The face rings a bell.....,6,22 July 2012,"Left on the doorstep of an orphanage run by nuns, newborns Moe, Larry and Curly grow up to uncharted levels of knuckle headed misadventure. Now their childhood home may have to close due to financial difficulties. But Larry, Curly and Moe, employed as the foster home's inept maintenance men, are determined to come to the rescue. Only The Three Stooges could become embroiled in an oddball murder plot - while stumbling into starring roles in a phenomenally successful TV reality show.....In my opinion, the Farrellys haven't made a good movie in nearly thirteen years, and I've never seen the original source material, so I had very low expectations of this.I was pleasantly surprised at just how child orientated it was, and how the Farrellys stayed away from all the smutty humour that made them famous, they must have really loved the titular characters.The story is good, if a little childish, and the narrative is cleverly done by splitting the movie into three palatable episodes.As I'm from the UK, I don't know how this will fare over here, but I hope it does attract an audience. It's great family fun, with lots of visual humour and immature moments that will make you laugh like a little kid.",The Three Stooges
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Three Stooges,7,29 July 2012,"The Farrelly brothers Bobby and Peter finally, after a string of comedies from Dumb and Dumber to Hall Pass, have a crack at one of the holy grails of American comedy The Three Stooges, given the remake fever going around, and yes, this is probably the only way that The Three Stooges film would be made, with slapstick humour and plenty of extreme physical comedy that the trio is known for. Like one of the lines in the movie, this film is really dim of wit, but captures so effortlessly the classical moments that define the Stooges' legacy.There's really little story here, which revolved around the Stooges - Larry (Sean Hayes), Curly (Will Sasso) and Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) - being brought up at an orphanage run by nuns - Jane Lynch as Mother Superior, Larry David as Sister Mary-Mengele (yes you read that right, as comic fodder of course), and an unbelievably slim Jennifer Hudson as Sister Rosemary - only for the Stooges' dangerous shenanigans to be bleeding the orphanage, forcing it to close in about 30 days time. Unless of course, someone comes up with about 800 over thousand dollars to keep it going. So the trio sets off into the real world to try and make some money, encountering the evil Lydia (Sofia Vergara) who's hatching a plan to bump off her rich husband.That's the gist of the storyline, together with the theme about family and togetherness that surprisingly worked very well, dealing with Moe's botched attempt at getting adopted at age 10, which was funny as hell, yet moving at the same time. But let's not kid ourselves, we're definitely not here to watch The Three Stooges go all melodramatic. We're here to witness them go on a comedic romp where danger is nothing but an understatement when these guys are put into any scenario. Nothing is sacred, and with the Farrelly's input, the usual toilet humour get their air time as well.But seriously (erm...), nothing works better than Moe, Larry and Curly going up against one another in Looney Tunes style, complete with rubberized equipment and sound effects - The Farrelly's even got to warn everyone not to follow their antics, for fear that we get caught up in comedic euphoria and start mimicking what we see on screen. Mimicry is what the actors here did best, together with the top notch costuming department who made Hayes, Sasso and Diamantopoulous look exactly like their legendary counterparts who propelled The Three Stooges to become household names. And kudos too to the actors in being just like the Stooges I remembered, voicing their roles, engaging in physical, slapstick comedy and probably earning a new generation of fans while at it too.It's not without some flaws, such as the very obvious use of dummies for the more extreme stunts, but I suppose that's all part of the charm in finally making this film a reality, where at one point in time was stuck in development hell with some big names attached to star. The filmmakers went with relative unknowns, and it worked wonders in allowing the characters of Larry, Curly and Moe to shine again, without being unnecessarily upstaged by the names of well known comedians. I've grown up watching the black and white episodes of The Three Stooges on television before I head out to school each morning, and the Farrelly's even adopted presenting this film in three episodes of about half hour each, which I felt was a nice touch. If you're in to laugh yourself silly at the theatres, then this modern version of The Three Stooges is your pick!",The Three Stooges
19,StevePulaski,"""We can do it!""",3,22 April 2012,"Very few people will disagree with me when I say ""The Three Stooges"" comedy troupe was one of the funniest gangs of the twentieth century. They revolutionized comedy, pioneered the sub-genre of slapstick along with The Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello with their no-limits, anarchic style of comedy, and became a household name in no time. The trio would come to produce one-hundred and ninety shorts for Columbia Pictures, but became gradually restrained overtime after Curly Howard's departure. The replacements became gradually inferior and the skits lost their charm once Shemp Howard, Curly's replacement, left.The big question in the 2000's decade was simple; will there be another movie focusing on The Three Stooges? You may recall a number of silly motion pictures involving the Stooges and them meeting a number of asinine characters such as Hercules and Snow White. That was about as far as some thought we'd get. In 2000, the idea for a brand new Stooges picture was circulating, and Columbia Pictures was beginning to become more and more interested after many years of neglect. For years, a number of online articles stated people like Andy Samberg, Johnny Knoxville, and Paul Giamatti were attached to the project. At one point, the Stooges were billed as Jim Carrey, Benicio Del Toro, and Sean Penn. My response to all the news? ""Just leave it alone"" I said. There was no reason a film had to be made.My plea was ignored. The Farrelly Brothers have succeeded in making a film that was thought to be stuck in development hell till the end of time. The Three Stooges film is a lame, yet somewhat inspired retelling of the comedy troupe, this time blatantly modernized to fit our current society. Many may not know what I'm talking about when I say this, but I feel the Stooges are an outdated group. I love their original work and find them to be unique and sometimes devilishly funny (even if breaks are required), but compared to the humor we have now, it seems as if they don't transfer to the new world so well. They have grown old and so have we. During the transportation of the Stooges from the 1930's to the 2000's, it seems the humor, the wit, and the constructed simplicity have all been traded in for juvenile, tired sketches from recycled comedy bins.The story involves the Stooges, all nicely cast with Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe, Sean Hayes as Larry, and Will Sasso as Curly so the presence of big name actors isn't off-putting, desperately trying to save their childhood orphanage from being closed. They must come up with $830,000 to pay off the orphanage's debt and make sure parent-less children are kept in a safe haven. The nuns, who hate the Stooges with an undying passion, believe their optimism is foolish and that their efforts will fail. One of them is played by Larry David in drag. Yes, Curb You Enthusiasm's Larry David, who gets some of the biggest laugh in the picture. What was that about water weasels? The film involves their efforts and pathetic failings to try and garner the hefty amount of money. My feels during the film spanned a grandscale. I first approached the picture with dread, pursued on with a moderately tolerable attitude, grew weary, grew wearier, and finally accepted the fact it couldn't be done. Not in this movie. Things are too crass, juvenile, and overblown. Take the scene in the hospital for example. It was not amusing, enjoyable, or remotely funny. Just sad and stretched out for far passed its recommended lifespan.Including the cast of the reality show Jersey Shore was also an enormous miscalculation. I felt the screen shook like a magic eight ball and people from two totally different generations appeared. The inclusion of the show's characters are justified by two shallow reasons; one, for cheap jokes and tireless stabs (let me remind people that jokes about Justin Bieber, Jersey Shore, and vampires have run their course for far too long. It isn't funny anymore), and two, for an artificial ""no way"" moment.Perhaps this is the best film on the Stooges that can be made in this day and age. The audience I was with, comprised of not one woman, seemed to be roaring in laughter and were anxiously anticipating the next outrageous setup to commence. I was not, but to each their own. Humor is extremely subjective, and I can see skeptics walking into The Three Stooges and walking out presently surprised. It wasn't until the end it dawned on me the Farrelly Brothers actually directed the film. Their film work has been comprised of winners like Fever Pitch and Hall Pass, and some moderately effective works of entertainment like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary. I'm unsure of where to place The Three Stooges, since it needs an entirely new category. A failed impersonation would be a good one, almost like what I say when the Chicago Bears are performing badly; it's like the equipment managers put on the jerseys and said ""c'mon guys, we can do it!""

20,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Knuck, knuck, knuck, knuck! I'm a victim of circumstance!",8,22 April 2012,"I'm what you would call a rare commodity: a female stooge fan. When I was a little girl, every Sunday night from 1989 to 1994 there was a stooge marathon on TV and my dad and I would have popcorn and ice cream and just laugh the night away. I always wondered if it was nostalgia that I loved the stooges so much, but I still as an adult get together with my dad and will bring over a stooge DVD and watch it with him, his wife and my fiancé and still laugh like if we were seeing it for the first time. There was something so special about these guys who went through anything just to make people smile and you could tell that they loved doing so. They've inspired so many comedians today and a lot of people still consider them to be the top dogs of comedy, they really did create slap stick. So when I heard there was a movie coming out where the stooges were going to be in today's world, I just cringed, even more so when I learned it was the Farrelly brothers behind it, they're a hit or miss team. But in the surprise of 2012, we got a great comedy that I'm sure if the stooges were alive today would really enjoy and that's because of the lead actors who held this film together and had a lot of love and respect for these three knuckleheads.Ever since Moe, Larry, and Curly were dumped on the doorstep of the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage, they have wreaked havoc on the place and have left the nuns there scared. 25 years later, the trio is still living there and attempting to help out, and taking care of the kids as well. When they get wind the orphanage will be shutting down unless they can come up with $830,000 in 30 days, the trio volunteers to go out and try to raise the money somehow. A woman named Lydia is trying to kill her husband, and offers to pay the trio the money they need to take care of the job. However, they botch the job and leave the supposed husband in traction in the hospital. When they try to visit to finish the job, they are chased throughout the hospital and escape by jumping off the roof using a fire hose. They end up running into a now grown up Teddy, a boy they lost an adoptive family too, from the orphanage, who invites them to his anniversary party. Turns out that he's the actual husband they need to kill.What could've been a total flop turned into a very funny comedy and I think the reason it worked was because the obvious love that Sean Hayes, Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos had for the stooges. The jokes were perfect and even directly taken from some shorts. The mannerisms were also on key and you almost believe it's the real Moe, Larry and Curly on screen. Even the side characters were really funny like Sofía Vergara, Jane Lynch and Stephen Collins. I liked how we could see the stooges in an updated world where it's completely different from the 1930's. The film has a couple flaws like how they have this ""heart to heart"" with Moe which honestly was never apart of the stooge shorts. I can understand they have to have conflict in the movie, but it didn't work with the characters. Also there's an end credit scene where they explain the gags. I completely understand where they are coming from on this one, but really? After the film?! Why not before the film have a little disclaimer? It was lame and I'm sorry, it ruins the movie because it's like having James Cameron doing a scene after Titanic saying how the ship was CGI and none of the actors were actually hurt, it takes away from the film. Honestly, if you're too ignorant to explain to your children the difference between fantasy and film, you shouldn't be a parent. My dad explained all the gags to me when I was a kid and on top of that what kid can pick up a 20 pound hammer and hit someone in the head with it? OK, I end my rant on that. However, I think this film was a pleasant surprise and a pleasure to watch and I can't wait to add it to my stooge collection when it comes on blu ray.8/10",The Three Stooges
21,sddavis63,"What Else Would You Expect? It's The Three Stooges, After All!",7,1 February 2013,"I'm going to make a confession right off the top. I never, ever - not even as a kid - liked The Three Stooges. I don't know why. A lot of my friends did. Me? I just didn't find them funny. I didn't like their style of humour. Or maybe it was just that they seemed to do the same things over and over and over again so that it became boring. I don't know. But I never liked them. And, even more mysteriously (since I never liked them) I was drawn to this movie. I don't know why, but I wanted to see it. And it surprised me. It worked. It was classic ""Three Stooges"" stuff - and now, after all these years, I liked it.You have to go into this movie understanding The Three Stooges. It's going to be silly and mindless and even dumb. That's ""The Three Stooges."" If it weren't silly, mindless and dumb it would be a failure. For that, I give credit to those who made this. There was no pretension involved. Nobody came up with the idea that The Three Stooges had to have some dreadfully serious subplot. That's the problem with too many comedies these days. It seems that they can't just be comedies. They have to have a point or a message to go along with the laughs. That's fine, I suppose, but sometimes a movie should just be about the fun and laughs. Now, there is a tenuously serious subplot here, revolving around the attempt by Curly, Larry and Moe to save the orphanage in which they were raised which is now being closed because it owes too much money. But it's very tenuous - serving mostly as a means of getting them out into the world to wreak the kind of havoc that only The Three Stooges can wreak. And it worked.Basically, this worked because it didn't take itself seriously, and it worked because of Will Sasso, Sean Hayes and Chris Diamantopoulos. They literally became Curly, Larry and Moe. They captured the essence of the characters. They were great. And I even liked the Farrelly brothers (Bobby and Peter, who directed) coming on screen at the movie's end to explain how the various bits of slapstick worked, with rubber hammers and sleight of hand, so that kids wouldn't be tempted to try the same things. Believe it or not that had occurred to me as I watched this, and even as I was enjoying it I was going to make that criticism, but the Farrelly brothers understood it too.Folks, it's The Three Stooges. It's dumb. silly and mindless. And that's OK sometimes. And that's necessary if you're going to make a movie about The Three Stooges. How else would you do it. This one captured them - bang on. And it was fun! (7/10)",The Three Stooges
22,Hellmant,"Extremely faithful to it's source material, which is it's biggest strength as well as it's biggest flaw!",5,17 July 2012,"'THE THREE STOOGES': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The Farrelly Brothers feature adaptation of the popular mid-20th century comedy act 'The Three Stooges' (which were most well known in short films) is extremely faithful to it's source material (which is it's biggest strength as well as it's biggest flaw). Peter and Bobby Farrelly co-directed and co-wrote the film (with Mike Cerrone) and actors Sean Hayes (of 'WILL & GRACE' fame), Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos star as Larry, Curly and Moe. The film also features Sofia Vergara, Jane Lynch, Jennifer Hudson and Larry David in supporting roles. There is a lot of talent involved in the film (as you can probably tell) but you definitely can't tell that by the finished project. It's probably the worst Farrelly Brothers film I've ever seen. The film is split in to three 27 minute part short films (each individually titled). The continuing story revolves around Larry, Curly and Moe having to raise $830,000 to save the orphanage they grew up at (and are still living in, at age 35) from being shut down. Vergara plays the film's gorgeous villain (of course), Lydia, she's the scheming wife of an old friend of the stooges, Teddy (Kirby Heyborne), who used to live with them at the orphanage. She wants her husband killed so she can inherit his fortune and be with her lover (Craig Bierko). The film also involves a subplot where Moe is cast on the reality TV show 'JERSEY SHORE'! I was never a big fan of 'The Three Stooges'; I remember watching their shorts (on TV) and thinking they were funny as a kid but not after I got past about the second or third grade. Their humor is so lowbrow, violent and witless I have a hard time imagining how any adult could find any entertainment value in it (other than for nostalgic reasons, which I understand). Like I said this movie is extremely faithful to the original short films; the three leads are perfectly cast and you can tell the Farrelly's put a lot of passion in to the project. Die-hard fans of the original trio will probably really enjoy the film. I was amused and somewhat intrigued by the effort that was made to stay true to the original material and also once again found it perplexing why anyone ever thought it was funny. I loved watching Sofia Vergara as a stunning femme fatale villain though (once again) and the three leads doing their best imitations of the classic characters was somewhat entertaining as well.

An hour and a half is not long, but for this kind of movie it is. I can take the wackiness of the Three Stooges in small bouts, but not for a feature-length film. That being said, the actors really pulled this one off and they are nearly similar to their real-life counterparts.The Farrelly Brother's adaptation of the classic show tells us the tale of Moe, Larry, and Curly from their younger days in the orphanage to the present day where they have to save their old orphanage from foreclosure.The acting is pretty good. The guys playing the Stooges look and really acted like them so that was a pleasure to see. Larry David is really funny as one of the nuns. However about the cast of Jersey Shore.....uh no thanks! Overall, this is a decent adaptation, perhaps the best one you could ask for. The antics do grow old after awhile, but for what it's worth, they are quite funny. I do like the stomach-punching and the eye-gouging the best. There are some moments here that cracked me up big time and that actually surprised me.

But surprisingly, it's a pretty decent film...though it will hardly end up on AFI's best 100 anything list. Nevertheless, it's entertaining and worth a few laughs.The 3 primary actors deserve compliments. Chris Diamantopoulos has Moe down pretty darned good. Sean Hayes is surprisingly effective as Larry, even down to the slight slowness in speech. And Will Sasso is just fine as Curly.I'm not so sure the rest of the cast fares quite so well. Jane Lynch is fine as the Mother Superior, though the role hardly tests her acting abilities. Larry David as one of the sisters is nothing more than Larry David in drag; if he has any acting ability...well, I'm still waiting. It's also nice to see some of the other faces here, including that of Isaiah Mustafa -- the Old Spice guy! In terms of plot, it's about equal to the plot level of the old Three Stooges shorts. Nothing more, nothing less. There is no attempt at social commentary here, something that we all belatedly realized was present in some of the old Stooges shorts. The producers have sewn together three ""chapters"" (for wont of a better term) into three stories which certainly do have the feel of the old flicks, and the three lead actors certainly have all the mannerisms and stunts down pretty well.If you're a Stooges fan, you'll probably like this flick, which means that men will like it and most women probably won't.

29,zkonedog,"An Ode AND A Re-Imagining, With Both Working Splendidly",9,10 March 2017,"The Three Stooges, and their unique brand of slapstick humor, are an American comedy institution. The trouble is, you are either rolling on the floor laughing at them, or you think there material is the dumbest shtick in the world. If you fall into the latter category, stop reading this review now, as you will hate this movie with a flaming passion. If a Stooge appreciator or connoisseur, however, then this big-screen adaptation will have you short of breath once again!For a basic plot summary, this movie follows the head-slapping, hair-pulling, eye-poking adventures of Larry (Sean Hayes), Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos), & Curly (Will Sasso) as they try to raise money to save an orphanage. In typical Stooge fashion, they bumble around for awhile and engage in the sort of hijinks one would expect from the trio. Along the way, they run into the cast of the Jersey Shore, Moe becomes a famous reality star, and the gang even have to mend a relationship issue stemming from their collective past.This film is a rousing experience because it works on two (well, three, really) levels...1. It serves as an ode to the original Stooges. Though nothing will ever quite be the same as old Howard, Fine, & Howard, this movie captures their subtle nuances as best as humanly possibly. The original sound effects are used, the casting is spot-on (especially with Moe...one could close their eyes in the theater and think it was Moe Howard himself), and the physical comedy is at its best. Besides the actors themselves, though, some of the plots, music, and camera-work itself honors the original shorts. The movie is split up into three ""shorts"", the music is the same cackling Stooges theme heard countless times throughout the ages, and some of the cut-aways feature easily-identified dummies being hurled or pummeled in obvious fashion (as happened frequently in the original slapped-together shorts).2. It is also a re-imagining of the Stooges for a new generation. Instead of re-treading the same old material, the Farelly brothers put the trio in today's time period, what with its similar Depression-era themes and new technological gadgets that befuddled the bumblers even further. The directors even add a bit of a backstory to the characters that actually works pretty well in the context of the overall plot. You can't say this film is utterly devoid of sense or emotion.3. Finally, in keeping with the hearty Stooges tradition, this movie is just plain funny! As a huge Stooge fan, I came into it with a healthy mixture of excitement and doubt. It vastly exceeded even my wildest expectations and had me belly-laughing throughout. Does every single scene work for everyone? Of course not. However, enough DO work to keep you yuking (or nyuking, if you will) it up for ninety minutes.Overall, the bottom line for this flick is this: If you enjoy Stooge-type humor, give this one a shot...I think you'll be glad you did! If you don't care for the slapstick style, than stay away or prepare to be bored. This is also a very child-friendly flick that can be enjoyed by literally all ages.",The Three Stooges

It completely lacks all the joy and the spontaneous fun of the original shorts, being just a mean-spirited mess that is corny and melodramatic when it is not painfully unfunny and dishonest.Comparing the original Three Stooges shorts with this movie is like comparing actual orange juice with some Artificial Flavor Juice: No matter how much it tried, the Artificial Flavor Juice could never something like the real stuff.

And it was not funny.3rd fatal mistake - Filming the story in color and having it set in modern times was a grave error. It would have been so much more effective had the story been given a nostalgic, 1940's look.4th fatal mistake - No pie fights!!!

We'll raid your fridge and drink your booze.¨The Three Stooges were the kings of slapstick comedy during the early 30's and continued to have success until the 60's. They were amongst the greatest comedians in early film history along with Charles Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, and Buster Keaton who all wrote the book on this genre of film. The Farrelly brothers were also huge fans of the trio so they decided to make an original film in homage to the kings of knucklehead comedies. Fans of the Stooges might be impressed, I on the other hand didn't find the film all that hilarious. I laughed at very few scenes, although I did admire some of the wit. The problem is that I was familiar with most of the gags and I find it hard to laugh at a same joke twice. I wasn't really a fan of the original Three Stooges, but I still admired their work. If anything works in this film it's the addition of the Jersey Shore cast to remind us how terrible television has gotten, and how far away we are from the early years where truly talented actors dominated the screen. Nowadays, with reality television no particular talent is needed and Jersey Shore is proof of that. Seeing the Three Stooges interact with the reality cast was a reminder of this. The cast was pretty good, although none of the actors are real film stars: Sean Hayes is known for his work in Will and Grace, Will Sasso for MadTV, Jane Lynch for Glee, Larry David for Seinfeld, and Sofia Vergara for Modern Family. They were funny and reminded us that some TV series actually do work and we don't have to fall for all those reality television stars.Larry (Sean Hayes), Curly (Will Sasso), and Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) grow up in an Orphanage run by Mother Superior (Jane Lynch). At first the nuns were excited about the arrival of the triplet babies, but when the film moves ten years forward none of them want anything to do with the kids. They mean trouble and no one can handle them, especially Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David) who wants to call it quits. They design a plan to get the boys adopted, but no one ever chooses them. The movie then jumps 25 years forward where we see the Stooges as grown men still living in the Orphanage working in Maintenance. Mother Superior, Sister Mary-Mengele, and Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson) are still there as well and ironically haven't aged one bit. Things change for the Stooges when Monsignor Ratliffe (Brian Doyle-Murray) arrives to deliver the bad news: There is no money to finance the orphanage any more, if they don't come up with 830,000 thousand dollars in a month they will lose it. That is when the three stooges go on a mission to raise the money and save the place. For the first time in their lives, Larry, Curly, and Moe set their foot in society and have no clue as to how to raise the money, but their lives change when they meet Lydia (Sofia Vergara) who offers them the money if they kill her husband. All sort of misunderstandings take place as the three stooges try to find a way to save their beloved orphanage.The Farrelly brothers' comedy, There is Something About Mary, changed modern comedies in the 90's. It was one of my favorite comedies at the time and many comedies have been shaped by it ever since. Unfortunately, the Farrelly brothers haven't been able to match the success of that film and have been on a downhill slope since then. The Three Stooges had some hilarious moments, but unfortunately the great jokes were too spread out apart and mixed with some terrible scenes that didn't work and killed the momentum (for instance the baby diaper changing scene). It was unfortunate because the cast was pretty good. The three actors who played the stooges had the physical appearance of the original ones and really gave funny performances. The problem I have with these slapstick comedies is that once you've seen one hilarious movie about the Stooges then you've seen them all. There is nothing new to add to the premise which always includes a lot of eye-popping, slapping, smacking each other over the head with a hammer, and so on. If you see it for the first time the gag is hilarious, but watching the same act over and over again gets old. The Three Stooges wasn't terrible, but it wasn't a memorable comedy either. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are a die hard Three Stooges fan.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",The Three Stooges

39,dwpollar,Silly antics of the stooges are replicated...,4,5 September 2012,"1st watched 9/3/2012 – 4 out of 10 (Dir- Peter Farrelly & Bobby Farrelly): Silly antics of the stooges are replicated pretty well by Diamantoupoulos, Hayes & Sasso respectively as Moe, Larry and Curly. The Farrelly brothers, who wrote & directed the film, don't modernize the characters much as to not cheapen the original, but unfortunately slapstick comedy doesn't usually make a very good movie – in my opinion. There are some funny bits with only a couple scenes going overboard – especially the baby peeing western spray-out and only one boob joke – so for the most part the movie can be enjoyed by kids who like this kind of humor. A silly attached piece at the end by the filmmakers assured the viewers that the Three Stooges used rubber mallets to hit one another and that they really didn't poke each other in the eyes(what was this all about?—nowadays kids see so much worse!!). I can't believe the Farrelly brothers who have made movies with bowel movements as jokes – stooped to pressures to add this piece. Anyway, as far as the rest of the movie, it was laid out like their shorts with the first being their birth & introduction to an orphanage, the 2nd their adult-hood in the orphanage, and the 3rd their attempt to save the orphanage from being shut down. Unusual bits were thrown in like a ""Sound of Music"" piece at the beginning which was cut short by a mean nun played by none other than Larry David!! Moe then gets involved with the Jersey Shore-folk and becomes a new cast member who beats up the other members(this part, I admit I liked!). And, of course, everything works out for the best of the good guys eventually. Unless you are a die-hard Three Stooges fan – I would pass this one upunfortunately I'm not, and haven't been converted yet.",The Three Stooges
40,JoeKarlosi,The Three Stooges (2012) ***,7,17 April 2012,"With terrible past modernized reboots such as THE LITTLE RASCALS and THE HONEYMOONERS I had my doubts about this long-delayed project having any chance of being decent, but the final product delivered the goods and blew me away. If you don't like or get anything out of The Three Stooges you have no business subjecting yourself to this movie; but if you're a big fan like me you should soitenly make a point of seeing it ASAP. This is a funny and wonderful tribute to Moe, Larry, and Curly featuring three actors who nailed the voices and mannerisms of that zany comical trio. It is those dead-on performances along with dedicated writing which captures the dialogue and sight gags from the old Stooge short films that make all the difference. I never thought I'd say this, but while watching THE THREE STOOGES I sometimes forgot I was watching actors imitating the original knuckleheads.As Moe, Chris Diamantopoulos has the lead Stooge's gruff look and sarcastic voice down to a tee. Sean Hayes (famous for his role on WILL AND GRACE) surprised me with his accurate sour expressions for Larry, along with his distinctively whining sounds. Will Sasso makes for a delightfully true-to-form childlike Curly (with one very minor quibble: he was just a tad too tall). Naturally, a film featuring the Three Stooges is required to be full of hand slaps, eye poking, body slamming, head bopping, and other assorted varieties of physical slapstick -- and these performers make it look natural, not staged or forced. So much of the well-timed mayhem is taken straight out of the old movies, it's a gratifying homage. Wisely, the Stooges look, dress, speak, and act like they're stuck in the 1930s while trying to function in a 21st Century environment.The story doesn't really need to matter, but it's a good one in the theme of several old Stooges films: Moe, Larry, and Curly must try to raise money to save the orphanage where they themselves grew up as children. (Their orphanage is staffed by nuns, one of them played by CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM'S Larry David, who makes a perfect foil for the Stooges' shenanigans). To raise the cash they try to get jobs but cross paths with a femme fatale who promises to pay the dimwits to knock off her unsuspecting husband. Lots of laughs and awkward situations ensue, one of them utilizing the Reality TV show JERSEY SHORE ... and the disdain some of us have for those obnoxious cast members is well-balanced when they're placed in the slap-happy hands of Moe Howard. It's so rare these days to have fun at the movies. I saw this twice at the theater and enjoyed the audience reaction ... this is a good time for the kids, and hopefully the film will produce brand new young fans who will want to check out the original Three Stooges comedies. It's also a movie with some heart and soul, and I can only imagine that the real Moe, Larry, and Curly are smiling down with pride. Their legacy is more secure than ever. *** out of ****",The Three Stooges
41,aharmas,"Sensationally Hilarious, Perfect Tribute to the Silly Trio",10,15 April 2012,"Most importantly, remember this is silly physical comedy, and it took a big risk to try to emulate those giants of entertainment. True, the writing was never their forte, but their timing and appeal is ongoing, and high marks are in order for the three leads who dared to take on those roles. They have done a spectacular job, and many laughs are guaranteed. Contrary to most of the so-called comedy out there, there is no profanity here, only a good dose of innuendo, a big heart mixed with the most idiotic of routines, and enjoy every bit of the thin story, as you are treated to some great performances by Sasso, Hayes, Vergara, and Diamantopoulos who channels Curly in a most uncanny manner.The gags come fast, and there is barely any time to recover from one before the other comes is about to hit. Prepare for some crazy moments as the honor of nuns is ""protected"" by Larry, Curly, and Joe, and the hospital scenes are classic.At the heart of the story, the stooges are looking for a way to save their home, and through a series of crazy misunderstandings, we get to see them take on pop culture and turn most people's world upside down. The jokes on the so-called celebrities are priceless, and some of Diamontopoulos physical comedy brings to mind a feeling that must have been part of the audiences in the golden years of comedy. People must be aware this is no to be confused with high class because it doesn't aspire to be. It's, after all, the Farrelli Brothers, and they are batting home runs throughout the entire piece.Nostalgia is mixed with contemporary pop culture, and it's a perfect marriage of what can be achieved if the focus is well placed. Leave out any preconceptions, have an open mind, and enjoy the film.",The Three Stooges
42,Samiam3,The Stooges return to life...but not without some faults,6,13 July 2012,"The best thing about The Farrelly Brothers' movie of the Three Stooges is that the impersonations from Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and Chris Diamantopoulos are bang on; sometimes literally with a bang. These guys have physically embodied Moe and Larry Howard, and Curly Joe quite brilliantly. Unlike say Steve Martin's phony reinterpretation of Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies, these guys have actually put some effort into the characters. The question is, does that make the movie good enough on its own?My first issue with the movie is that I cannot decide whether it is too short or too long. Why is it too long? Well, when you think about it, Moe, Larry and Curly never really treated themselves as feature film characters. They offered the kind of rapid fire quirks designed for ten minute skits. When you take that kind of humour and stretch it out to an hour and a half, it starts to feel maybe a bit tiring about halfway through. My mother always hated the Three Stooges because of how violent they were. At one point, while I was watching, I thought to myself that she would find it torture to watch their slap stick for ninety minutes, let alone five to ten. On the other hand, Why is the movie too short you may ask? It's not like there is any lack of humour in the movie. On the contrary, there is too much of it. The Three Stooges is relentless, and has the kind of rushed feeling of those crappy movies adapted from SNL skits. The Farrelly brothers could've used a little more screen time (maybe another half hour) to craft either more character or story, but they have unfortunately neglected to.Something else that they have chosen to ignore is the comedic potential of having the Stooges in a contemporary setting (as opposed to the 1930's) There is one moment where Curly misinterprets what an Iphone is, which I thought was actually well written and original. The movie could've use dmore jokes like this. The Farrelly's have set it up (from the first act) so that Larry, Curly and Moe, are witnessing civilization for he first time in their lives, having grown up in the country. It is a set up with no real pay off. It almost makes me wonder if the film would have been better set back in the 1930's, but that would've certainly doubled the budget.It's a funny kids movie, that's the best I'll say for The Three Stooges. Maybe I'm a little too old for this. I just feel like if a little more thought had gone into the workings of the scenario than into the brilliant choreography of the stunts and gags, this would have been a better movie.",The Three Stooges
43,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Three Stooges (2012),8,16 July 2012,"I've never really sat down and watched The Three Stooges but I'm familiar with their work through their impact on popular culture. Before watching this movie, I decided to give the original shorts a try and I absolutely loved them. The humour is simple but brilliant. So it made me slightly cautious before watching this, but it's absolutely fantastic. The Three Stooges set out to save their orphanage by raising over $800,000. They find themselves mixed up in an assassination plot and Moe ends up on Jersey Shore. The actors and the Farrelly Brothers have completely recreated the magic of the originals. The three stars have their parts down perfectly, each of them doing bang-on impersonations but not overdoing the mannerisms and voices. The Farrelly Brothers keep the comedy innocent and even manage to bring originality to having babies pee on people. The slapstick is fast and well choreographed with a few puns thrown in for good luck. This isn't trying to convert any new fans, and some old fans may be put off, but they should know this is a perfect continuation of these characters. The Jersey Shore scenes are very well done, using the cast as simply punching bags. If you never liked this kind of humour, I doubt you'll like this, but I adored it for its simplicity and innocence.",The Three Stooges
44,Sandcooler,Bizarre experience,5,28 July 2014,"Are the Farrellys done? Apparently this is the big project they've been wanting to make ever since they first started, but two decades worth of thought couldn't make it any good. It has to be said though, this movie has some pretty decent gags. When you compare it to their other recent works, like ""The Heartbreak Kid"", you laugh a lot more. But somehow someway, ""The Three Stooges"" is still very hard to sit through. I know you can't make a Three Stooges reboot (or whatever the hell they call remakes nowadays) without slapstick, but by the fifth time you see them poke each other in the eye you've seen it. Particularly Will Sasso's Curly gets incredibly tiresome within the first twenty minutes. That's probably why the real guys always stuck to brief sketches, because it's all so repetitive. The old slapstick also doesn't gel at all with all the new stuff involved, particularly with the rather hackneyed idea of bringing in ""Jersey Shore"". There are actually some laughs in this movie, but it just goes absolutely nowhere so you tend to tune out.",The Three Stooges
45,bob-rutzel-1,"Soitenly not the same, but..............",5,18 July 2012,"The Three Stooges grow up in a Nun run orphanage. The orphanage will close due to lack of funding and the Stooges vow to get the money to keep the orphanage open.You may enjoy this rendition of the Three Stooges if you have never seen the originals. This is not a laugh fest but there are some sight gags that are amusing. The original Stooges didn't do the nyuk, nyuk, nyuking as much as is seen in here and that impact suffered some. Remember what I have always said about Hollywood comedies: silly and stupid things are mandatory and we "" soitenly"" have a lot of that in here. But, in order to pay homage to the original Stooges a lot of the ""mandatory"" stuff had to be included because the original Stooges did all that. Who does it better is for you to decide. To get the money to save the orphanage, the Stooges are offered a job to kill Mac (Craig Bierko) pretend husband of Lydia (Sophia Vergara), who is said to have a fatal disease and wants to go out on his own terms. This subplot comes out of the old FLETCH novels. Of course, it is Teddy (Kirby Heybourne) who will be the real victim/husband of Lydia who is married to Teddy and who wants Teddy's money. If you have followed this so far you just know all will go wrong. Hey, it's a comedy and more opportunities for nyuk, nyuk, nyuking. OMG!The cast of the Jersey Shore (reality TV show), Jane Lynch, Jennifer Hudson, Stephen Collins and Larry David round out the cast of notables. Larry David plays Sister Mary-Mengele (who may have been related to Mengele, the German doctor who experimented on WWII prisoners of war) and does a credible job that could open a new series for him. Anyway, why would he be named Mengele?The Farrelly brothers, who produced this, come out at the end of the movie to explain that the hammers and sledge hammers used to hit people were actually made of rubber and they warn kids not to do these things at home. What wasn't mentioned by them was the fully engaged chainsaw used on Curly's (Will Sasso) head. When I saw that I jumped as that was really out of place. Yes, the chainsaw was damaged on Curly's hard head. Still. not funny. That scene should have been cut.Now, get this: I read somewhere that the stars who were originally supposed to play the Three Stooges: Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, and Jim Carrey. Can you believe that? I believe the Farrelly brothers made the better choice with Hayes, Sasso and Diamantopoulos. Now, if you have seen the original Three Stooges, you can decide which three did it better. For me this was kind of pleasant, had good pacing and even with the Hollywood OMG ""mandatory"" stuff, this was watchable. But, make no mistake, this was nyuk, nyuk, nyuk not the same. Soitenlynot the same. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No. Suggestive dialogue: Some. Running chainsaw: Used on Curly's head.

I've seen it twice so far. Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and Chris Diamantopoulos were the perfect choices for Larry, Curly, and Moe. They had the mannerisms down perfectly. Larry, Curly, and Moe grow up together at the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage. They are best friends, but very dim-witted and cause trouble for all the nuns. After 25 years, they are suddenly sent out into the world to try and raise $830,000 to save the Orphanage. Along the way, they get caught up in a murder plot, slap and poke each other throughout, and save the life of one of their friends from the past. During a falling out, Moe ends up on one of the worst shows ever, Jersey Shore, but don't worry, Moe gives them what they deserve. Will the bumbling trio raise the money and save the Orphanage? If you want a fun slapstick comedy that pays tribute to the original kings of comedy, you'll love THE THREE STOOGES!!!",The Three Stooges
48,IonicBreezeMachine,"It's got a certain charm and the titular Stooges are well cast, but the movie's built upon material stretched way too thin.",5,4 January 2021,"Moe, Larry and Curly (played by Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes, and Will Sasso respectively) are dumped as babies at the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage and become such mainstays to the point they work there as not so handy handymen 25 years later. Now with the threat of the Orphanage's closure looming, the three set out to earn in needed funds in typical Three Stooges style.Beginning development back in 1997 as a vehicle for Phil Hartman as Moe before his unfortunate death, and then going through various stages of development hell having versions that at one point would've featured Sean Penn as Larry, and Jim Carrey as Curly, The Three Stooges journey to the big screen has been tumultuous to put it mildly. When the trailer came out, people's concerns over the quality of a feature length Stooges movie were exacerbated. However with its release the end product may not be strictly ""good"", but it's not a train wreck either.The opening 20 Minutes where we see the Stooges' infancy, childhood, and adulthood where they've become useless layabouts who do more harm than good are quite funny and do manage to recapture the feel of the older Stooges shorts. But the movie goes onward from there. While the movie is allegedly ""episodic"" as its title cards attempt to convey, each episode very much links back to the main goal of the plot that involves saving their orphanage home from destruction. Because The Three Stooges feels the need to anchor itself to a story, it also plays certain scenes involving the Stooges for pathos, which just doesn't feel fitting for The Stooges. The stretched material becomes all too apparent in the second half as not only do we see reliance on lowbrow gags like the stooges firing baby urine at each other, it also has shoehorned in pop culture gags involving smartphones, social media, and even Jersey Shore (which admittedly got a few chuckles from me seeing the Stooges annoy the cast of Jersey Shore). It's a shame the movie as a whole doesn't work because the titular Stooges are pitch perfect casting wise. The slapstick choreography is always on point, and the voices are near dead ringers for the originals. The movie can't really warrant a recommendation, but when compared against the likes of Car 54, Where Are You? or Duddley Do Right this is probably the best we could've hoped for regarding a feature length version of Three Stooges antics.Three Stooges manages to capture some of the charm of the original shorts, but even at a brisk 85 minute run time the material is way too stretched to justify itself. While the film for most part captures the slapstick shenanigans of the trio quite well, the movie keeps piling on excuses to extend itself involving subplots or lowbrow gags that make the film tiresome. It's not an outright failure, but it doesn't justify a viewing either.",The Three Stooges

The slapstick however ends about thirty-minutes into the film when it turns into a drama chase film.Also, the addition of ""Jersey Shore"" was a BIG letdown. Who really wants to see that mediocre show while paying to watch a movie? The Farrelly Brothers obviously never saw the REAL Three Stooges, or this film would have been funnier.

Ninety minutes of Moe slapping Larry and poking Curly in the eyes gets a little redundant.The stars do a great job of looking and sounding like the originals. The supporting cast is fun to watch.

As a watcher of ""no Shemp"" episodes for the past 50 years bringing them back in 2012 was a bit of nostalgia I could not pass up. This movie has some great laughs- many wonderful little bits- especially the roofing scene where- well, you'll just have to see it.The actors playing the stooges were superb. More than a mere impersonation of the 1940s characters, they really seemed to inhabit the stooges themselves.Therein may even be part of the problem- perfectly embodying the stooges gives us--- the stooges. And maybe the stooges weren't as much fun as I recall from my boyhood? They certainly weren't ""pleasant,"" and as a teacher I must say I don't find stupidity as hilarious as I used to.Overall, then- very well made, stooge-wise. the pace was very slow, however, and I was conscious of long and frequent gaps and lapses between the slapstick and the funny. And the argot and mannerisms of poor people from the rough urban areas of the late 1930s and early 1940s isn't very uplifting or attractive either.The trailer was a scream- I laughed out loud every time I saw it. Perhaps, then, they should have made a 20-minute version of the movie, packed with non-stop laughs? Wait a minute- that's what the Three Stooges themselves did back in the day. They sensed, or knew, or guessed, that this kind of loopy, goofy humor is good for about that long- a movie ""short."" The Farrelly Brothers should have imitated that aspect as well, and they'd have had a treasure!

But that's skipping ahead.Beginning with the Stooges as infants and cutting ten years later, things start a bit shaky. The child actors provide an intentional imitation die hard fans pray won't occur once the boys grow up. But not to worry; these Stooges do alright. When not performing the patented slapdash stunts – including the fingers in the eyes and the hollow konk on the head – the talents of Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe, Sean Hayes as Larry, and Will Sasso as Curly shine through. Moe has the best expressions, Larry does the closest imitation of the original voice, and Curly provides the funniest one-liners.Sight gags are fast and furious in the style of AIRPLANE and there's an interesting plot-point: Hired to kill the rich husband of a villainous bombshell, whose shady lover/partner suffers the Wile E. Coyote syndrome of near death pratfalls, the Stooges silly antics have purpose.Set up in three acts with title cards and a quick running time, the abundant slapstick never gets tiresome. Thankfully, this THREE STOOGES isn't the Farrelly Brothers upgrading to the ""toilet humor"" of the modern comedy. You can take your kids along – and there's even a strange ""Don't Try This At Home"" segment during the end credits. And hopefully they don't try a sequel.

This is exactly how the 3 stooges would look in modern times. And it was hilarious. All the bad puns, the childish humour, the slapping, the hitting, science being thrown to the wind, it was all there.The story is as follows; Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe have to come up with a substantial amount of money ($830,000 to be exact) to save the orphanage that raised them up as kids. To do so, they must go into the world and raise this money, by any means necessary.On a side note, the plot of this movie closely resembles the 3 stooges Nintendo game from 1989 - in the game, the stooges must raise money save an orphanage. so possibly the writer took the idea from there.With stars like Will sasso (who is quite famous for his MadTV skits as Kenny Rogers) Sofia Vergara (who is the modern day queen of cleavage) Jennifer Hudson, with a singing voice that can melt stone, and the Crew from Jersey Shore, this really is a family flick that the whole family will enjoy.Folks, go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.",The Three Stooges

I felt I was a bit too sophisticated, too uppity to fall for this low brow humor. But curiosity got the best of me and it has been the top movie at the box office. I loved it! Yes, it is silly but the humor of yesteryear still works today. This tale moves quickly as the three stooges, Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos), Larry (Sean Hayes), and Curly (Will Sasso) are literally dropped off at the orphanage. They quickly adapt and create mischief. Fast forward twenty five years and they set out on a mission for the nuns at the orphanage. Yes a through back to the Blues Brothers they seek on a quest to find the needed eight hundred and thirty thousand dollars that will save the only home they have known. This sets them off the big city and their adventure continue as their entrepreneur spirit gets them in some really dicey situations. These knucklehead cross pass with modern day knuckleheads, non else that Snooki and gang. A personal treat was to see all the background sites from Atlanta. Many locations around Midtown Atlanta and in one shot the 14th Street Playhouse marquee is in a clear shot. There is also several views of a stately manor that sits in the heart of Buckhead. There are also cameo experiences from Jennifer Hudson, Larry David, and Jane Lynch to name a few. The three stooges look very much like the original three stooges and maintain this appearance as they transition from child, adolescent, and adult. You got to love their hair style. Good things come in three and the Three Stooges does not disappoint. A must see, ""certainly!""",The Three Stooges
55,lagudafuad,Could have been better .,4,19 April 2012,"It is clear after seeing the three stooges that the Farrelly brothers love the original stooges a little too much. The brothers to me have been a little shy of delivery in their movies since Something About Mary (1998), before this was Hall Pass, which was also a drag.If you are a huge fan of the original stooges and don't believe in a remake, I will advice you stay clear of this movie. If you have not seen the stooges before and decide this will be your first. You may not like this picture. But if you love slapstick comedy, go ahead.One thing I must say is the performance given by Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes and Will Sasso as Moe, Larry and Curly respectively is so good and so like the original I actually applauded them for their work. Another high point in the movie is the mastery and well choreographed eye-pokes, knuckle sandwiches, elbow nudges, and stunts I was thrilled by them.But let's look at why this movie is lacking the Midas touch, too much recycling of the old stooges flick when all I need to do if I need to see them (i.e the old stooges) is visit the nearest video store. Irritating screenplay that makes me wonder why anyone will think, spraying baby urine, using them as squirt guns will be funny. Even Sofía Vergara performance as the villain too became boring after a while.The use of Larry David (maker of Seinfeld), as one of the nuns was weird too me and the joke of using Jennifer Hudson as one of the singing nuns went over my head, (I still haven't figured it out).The story is plain and simple as all stooges story starts till the trio make a mess of things, The trio needed to raise 830,000 dollars to save their orphanage from closing a task they took upon their themselves to save their home.They decided to do all it will take to raise the money, and this began the journey of the stooges.Their journey led them to the show ""Jersey Shore"" and they had to interact with the cast on the show, and we saw eye poking, punching, head hitting, all over the place and I just couldn't wait for it to end.Jersey Shore is a waste of T.V time to me, now add the stooges...???

Their comedy worked back then, and they were the idols of slapstick comedy. But in the movie, I just don't think that this type of humor is relative for a young audience of our present era. It tries really hard to still relate to our new era. That's why when the movie came on, I was expecting to despise every single minute of the film, thinking it was the new ""Jack and Jill"" sequel. However, surprisingly, although this is not a good movie in any department whatsoever, at least it wasn't god-awful. Yeah, some of the jokes fell flat, and mostly the nature of it all was just downright dumbfounding, but there's more that a movie needs for it to be awful. Yet, this movie didn't need that! There were some things that worked in the movie. For example, this movie is actually nostalgic to the original show. The theme song will play at times, the scenes are separated into chapters, some scenes fade in between one another, and they actually found actors that look, sound, and feel like the Three Stooges. Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe, Sean Hayes as Larry, and Will Sasso as Curly, all portray an exact impersonation of these three bumbling heroes. But here's what did not work in this movie. There are a few share of giggles into this movie, but overall, this movie had moments that were just not funny. Some moments just left me in a dumbfounded matter, and I didn't buy the comedy in this one. The storyline was weak, all those celebrity cameos (Jane Lynch, Jennifer Hudson, Larry David, Sofia Vergara, and the cast of Jersey Shore) were unnecessary, the jokes fell flat, and all of that slapping and poking was better off in the past, and not suited for a 90-minute long movie. Let's not forget that moment at the end credits when....well, you have to see it to disbelieve it. ""The Three Stooges"" is a mixed bag of a movie, in my honest opinion. Nothing was great, and nothing was awful, so this movie is somewhat harmless. But everything else about this movie was just too pointless, too humorless, and it serves no purpose. I'll always be a Three Stooges fan, but when these three lovable morons are put in a full-length movie, it's probably not the best idea in the world. ""The Three Stooges"", in my review, ""undeniably harmless, but sadly weak in delivery"".",The Three Stooges
57,tforbes-2,Well worth it!,10,28 May 2012,"I finally got to see ""The Three Stooges,"" and it is well worth it!I'll admit that it was weird to see child versions of the Stooges, and also weird to see them in a Catholic orphanage, considering their Jewish origins. And it was strange to see the Georgia locales, as opposed to those of Southern California, though I am not complaining.But it is one hell of a fine tribute to these guys, and we get to see so many of the same gags that made the Stooges famous. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't consider the ""Jersey Shore"" references a bad thing at all. I admire how the three ""shorts"" all tied together.And I admire how this film was played with a real heart. I think Moe, Larry, Curly and Shemp would have been proud.As per the performers, they work really well. You can tell they care about their roles. As for the others, the ""Jersey Shore"" members were fun to watch, and Sofia Vergara was also a standout. I would not object to another Stooge film myself, and I am definitely getting the DVD when it is released!",The Three Stooges

59,TheHonestCritic,"Here we have a movie remake of the iconic show, ""The Three Stooges"". What could possibly go right?",2,1 May 2020,"""The Three Stooges"" (2012), why does this film exist? Honestly, who green-lit this?! For those who may not know, my favorite TV show of all-time is ""The Three Stooges"". When I first heard that this ""movie"" was being produced, naturally, I was skeptical. I thought: ""no, has Hollywood really reached this kind of low?"" Then, I figured: ""maybe if it has a decent script, with good actors and direction, it could work, maybe."" But, as soon as I saw the first trailer, I knew right then and there it was all wrong. After that, I said to myself: ""well, sometimes movie trailers can be deceiving. Plus, the actor playing Moe looks a lot like the original Moe Howard."" When I went to watch it in the theater, I liked it, sort of. However, when I watched it again at home on TV, I noticed the flaws of this ""movie"". This ""film"" now ranks on the top ten worst comedy films I have ever seen! It has a terrible story, horrible acting, cheesy special effects and a generic overproduced soundtrack. The ""story"", or lack thereof, was shot in the foot when some ""genius"" decided to incorporate nuns into the script. Keep in mind, I have nothing against nuns. They are a very nice and respectful group of people. But, what do ""The Three Stooges"" have to do with nuns? Nothing! Remember, I've watched every single episode of the original ""The Three Stooges"" show many times, and not one of them has anything to do with nuns. Don't even get me started on the inclusion of ""Jersey Shore"". I absolutely loathe that show, and it's one of the worst shows in recent years! The fact that it somehow got tied into a ""movie"" about the ""The Three Stooges"" just sickens me to no end. When I saw that it was going to be in this ""film"", I thought: ""no, no, no..... I've got to be hearing things. No one would be that stupid to include 'Jersey Shore' into this 'film'. No way!"" But, sure enough, they did. What? WHAT?! That's an insult to the original ""The Three Stooges"" TV show! Other than that, it's just your everyday cliched money-raising storyline to save a cliched orphanage from it's eventual cliched destruction. Plus, ""The Three Stooges"" characters are not brothers on the original show. They refer themselves as Howard, Fine and Howard! How did anyone with a brain miss that? Obviously, the script writer is not a fan of ""The Three Stooges""! Another kick in the nuts is the end credits scene with actors playing the Farrelly Brothers (THE DIRECTORS OF THIS ""FILM""). They give a public service announcement that serves as a warning to children not to do anything depicted in this ""movie"". Really? Why did they have to shove that in our faces? Whatever happened to good parenting? Yes, there are still good parents out there today, but a lot of them suck. Good parents should be able to explain to their kids not to do dangerous things in real life. My apologies to the parents of today, most of you all suck. Try being a parent once in a while! That pointless public service announcement just detracts from the story of the ""film"", what little there is! The acting is nothing short of a joke all around, all of the actors and actresses put on subpar performances. Which is a shame, because the majority of them have acted well in other movies and shows! What's their excuse in this ""film""? The only somewhat decent performance comes from Chris Diamantopoulos, who plays Moe in this ""movie"". Surprisingly, his voice and mannerisms are almost spot-on! However, on the other hand, Sean Hayes is boring as Larry, and Will Sasso is horrible as Curly. Maybe if someone else had dubbed over Sasso's voice, then his portrayal of Curly could have possibly been believable. Maybe! All of the performances from the actors and actresses just make me cringe. Most of the special effects are passable, but a few of them are obviously cheap just by looking at them. Finally, the music is boring, cheesy and overproduced. In the original show, there was very little to no music in the episodes. Here, there's music playing almost every second! I almost pulled my hair out! The only, (ONLY), good thing in this ""movie"" are the sets/locations. They were actually not too bad, and gave the ""film"" a decent atmosphere. When I went to see this ""movie"" at the theater, I went inside with very high expectations, and since the first viewing, I've been nothing short of disappointed. Every viewing, or clip I see of this ""movie"" just makes me hate it even more. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. To all fans of ""The Three Stooges"" TV show, stay far away from this pile of filth of a ""movie"" as possible. Trust me, I'm saving you 90 minutes of your life! Just stick with the original show instead, it's eons better than this ""movie"". If only the original Moe would come back to life and beat up the writers and producers of this ""movie""! To the spirits of the original Stooges, I just have to say: ""I'm sorry that this 'film' exists. I promise that I will never watch this 'movie' ever again."" As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't even exist!",The Three Stooges
60,Chris_Pandolfi,A Movie Revival? Coit-ainly!,5,13 April 2012,"I must recuse myself as not being the biggest fan of the original Three Stooges comedy team and the shorts that made them so famous. I always thought the act amounted to little more than a one-trick pony; there's only so much face-slapping, head-pounding, eye-poking, nyuk-nyuking, and woo-wooing I can take before it becomes stale and repetitive. If you've seen one, you've pretty much seen them all – the occasional tweaks to the act notwithstanding. Knowing this, I find myself in the position of reviewing The Farrelly Brothers' ""The Three Stooges,"" which isn't a biopic but a revival in which new actors replace Moe Howard, Curly Howard, and Larry Fine as their knuckleheaded alter egos. True to form, the film is a juvenile comedy that features scene after scene after scene of relentless, over the top slapstick.I'm well aware that there are audiences that live for this kind of filmmaking, and I will not begrudge them for having a little fun. But by my sensibilities, the film is just as much a one-trick pony as the original shorts, and it gets old after around ten minutes. In specific instances, the Farrelly Brothers are wildly wrong in what they think is funny. Consider, for example, a scene that occurs after the Stooges infiltrate a hospital; when they find themselves in the nursery ward, they get into a water fight, except it isn't water, and they use newborn babies instead of plastic pistols. There's also the scene in which Larry accidentally tosses a peanut into the blowhole of a dolphin, forcing Curly to perform the Heimlich maneuver. And then there's the scene in which all three Stooges turn a golf course into a salmon farm – which in this case translates as rows of helpless fish flapping away on the lawn and getting the occasional drink from a water can.To give credit where credit is due, Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes, and Will Sasso do a very good job with their depictions of Moe, Larry, and Curly respectively. It's not just in their voices, although that is key; it's also in their physicality, which is a must if you're playing a Stooge. Every slap, poke, and body slam had to be planned ahead of time, and I'm sure that trust, listening, and understanding were required of them all. It all comes down to choreography, and the trio has it down pat. Having said all that, I was even more impressed with Skyler Gisondo, Lance Chantiles-Wertz, and Robert Capron, who play the Stooges as ten-year-old boys. If they're this good at doing impressions at such a young age, imagine what they will be like when they're ten to twenty years older.The plot is divided into three titled episodes, although I really didn't see why this was necessary, as all of them are mere chapters of the same overarching story. After being zipped in a duffle bag and unceremoniously dumped on the doorstep of a secluded Catholic orphanage, the Stooges grow up as unadoptable lunkheads. This is much to the chagrin of the staff, which includes Mother Superior (Jane Lynch), Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson), and the perpetually peeved Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David). Twenty-five years after their arrival (at which point the Stooges are adult men but the Sisters look exactly the same age), the orphanage faces foreclosure and eviction. This is because, after a lifetime of the Stooges causing accidents, no insurance company will offer coverage. The only solution is $890,000, which must be collected in a month's time.Determined to save their home, the Stooges venture off into the world, where they stick out like a sore thumb, and try any harebrained scheme to make money. As this is happening, a spoiled woman named Lydia (Sophia Vergara) ropes the unwitting trio into a plot to murder her husband, a wealthy lawyer named Teddy (Kirby Heyborne), who just happens to be from the same orphanage as the Stooges. Also involved is Lydia's boyfriend, Mac (Craig Bierko), who inevitably becomes the one guy that ends up in a full-body cast with his jaws wired shut. Eventually, Moe will quite by accident be added to the cast of ""Jersey Shore."" I have to admit, there is something perversely hilarious about Moe slapping the hell out of Snooki, The Situation, and JWoww.""The Three Stooges"" isn't worth recommending, although there are specific scenes I enjoyed at a superficial level. One is when the entire cast of ""Jersey Shore"" has an argument with the producers: ""Wait a minute,"" says Sammi, coming to a disturbing realization, ""you're saying that this whole show is all about ratings?"" And then there's an epilogue sequence in which two muscular men who are clearly not the Farrelly Brothers (but claim to be them anyway) demonstrate that every physical gag seen in the film is not real and shouldn't be tried at home. They even show how the eye-poking effect is achieved, first in real time and then in slow motion. Truth be told, I'm not sure who this information would benefit. It seems pretty unlikely to me that die-hard ""Stooges"" fans wouldn't already know.",The Three Stooges

62,ReelCheese,Three Unwise Men,5,18 August 2013,"By the time this film came out, I had not watched an original Three Stooges short in about 18 years. I did not remember the original Stooges being overly hilarious or ingenious and was not sure a PG-rated update would rewrite my recollections.But THE THREE STOOGES proved to be an amusing-enough ride. And we have the performances of the new Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos), the new Larry (Sean Hayes) and the new Curly (Will Sasso) to thank for that. With obvious affection for the original actors, and some obvious voice training, the new trio illustrate the subtle genius of the Stooges' shtick. For some reason, if done just the right way, whacking a guy in the head with a sledgehammer can still be chuckle-inducing in 2013.Directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly borrowed a page from THE BRADY BRUNCH MOVIE by injecting the Stooges into contemporary times. The approach works particularly well here since even the original Stooges never quite grasped the realities of the world of the 1930s, '40s and '50s that they encountered. The Stooges here are charmingly ""pure of heart, dim of wit,"" to quote the new Larry.Just like the original Stooges shorts, THE THREE STOOGES is cohesively imperfect. One scene, involving peeing babies, attempts a gentle form of gross-out humor that feels just plain awkward. The Stooges' famous shtick -- the nose pinching, head bopping, toe crunching and hair yanking -- is at times gut-busting but wears a little thin as the hour-mark of this brief film approaches.If you hated the original Stooges, you will hate this movie. If you sort of liked them, you will sort of like this movie. If you loved them, you will find this to be a touching monument to those pioneers of comedy. Supposedly there will be a sequel, so we probably haven't seen the last of these guys just yet.",The Three Stooges

Perhaps the rating is so low because most who loved the stooges are older now, so the new generation may not get the humor ergo the low rating. The acting is superb, all three actors playing Larry, Curly, and Moe are spot on, but Chris Diamantopoulos stands out a little from the others, nailing Moe to a tee. The Farrelly brothers hit another home run with this one. Well worth the watch!",The Three Stooges
64,D_Burke,"""The Three Stooges"" Made This Wiseguy Laugh",7,10 April 2012,"There's already a risk in creating a Three Stooges movie that is not a biopic, but one where three modern-day actors play three hugely iconic characters. In particular, characters whose popularity has not dimmed in the slightest since their heyday in the Great Depression.A five year old today may wonder why people aren't talking in a Charlie Chaplin movie, or what the Marx Brothers are talking about in their films. However, if you show him a Three Stooges short, chances are he will be so busy laughing he won't wonder where the color went.A child born in 2007 will no doubt find the Three Stooges as funny as one born in 1927. Therefore, if Hollywood screws this movie up, they can anticipate a sizable band of enraged fans carrying pitchforks and torches, and maybe a few hammers too.Fortunately, the mob can rest their pitchforks and hammers, provided they don't land on another guy's head. If they see ""The Three Stooges"", they will probably laugh, as I did.""The Three Stooges"" had the potential to fail miserably, but did not thanks to the movie mainly sticking to what makes the Three Stooges funny: the slapstick. The actors who play the Stooges never miss a beat, and their timing on the physical gags could not be better timed.It helps that at least two out of the three actors are relative unknowns. Chris Diamantopolous (as Moe) and Will Sasso (as Curly) are not household names, and are known best for their TV appearances (with Sasso having been a cast member on ""Mad TV""). However, once the movie gets going, you begin to think that they have been possessed by the spirits of Moses and Jerry Horwitz, respectively.Sean Hayes is the most recognizable of the three, which poses a slight liability. When he first appears on screen, you may find yourself saying, ""Is Jack from 'Will & Grace' going to a Halloween party?"" However, Hayes also goes for gold as Larry, and fortunately nails the role as much as he gets nailed in the eyes.Getting hit in the head may look easy when you're watching it, but it's just like spoken word comedy: the timing better be right. In almost every case, the slaps to the face or hits with a hammer are funny, and the Farrelly Brothers never forget the element of surprise in many of the gags.The plot is far from original, and unquestionably borrowed from other movies. The Three Stooges are raised in an orphanage run by nuns. Once it's revealed that the orphanage will be shut down because of unpaid back taxes, I almost expected Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) to inform the Stooges with a ruler in her hand. If Moe had told her, ""It looks like you're up the creek"", it would have been a great setup for slapstick, but one that has definitely been done before (as in ""The Blues Brothers"" (1980)).Having no clue how to raise the $830,000 necessary to save the orphanage, the nitwits get suckered into a plot to kill a wealthy man by his greedy wife Lydia (Sofia Vergara) and her lover Mac (Craig Bierko). It doesn't matter that this subplot is hackneyed. The movie doesn't forget the fun in seeing how these three guys are going to royally screw up whatever plans the villains have. What matters is whether or not their bumbling and stumbling is funny.These Three Stooges of the same name but different actors fumble like experts, which is where the movie triumphs. The film falters when it adds pop culture and trends to the mix. For every mention of new technology, there seems to be an awful pun one of the Stooges blurts out. Try not to groan when someone asks to tweet the three knuckleheads, and Curly replies, ""Tweet us to dinner? Why soitenly!""I also thought the parts where Moe joins the cast of ""Jersey Shore"" could have been taken out entirely. When Moe bonks The Situation in the head, or pulls out Jennifer ""J-woww"" Farley's hairs out of her nose, it's not as funny as when he does it to Larry or Curly. Plus, it is amazing how bad the cast of ""Jersey Shore"" acts even when playing themselves!The reason ""The Three Stooges"" legacy continues to live on long after the deaths of the original seven (yes seven) actors is because the movies weren't dated. Sure, they were black and white, but slapstick never goes out of style. ""Jersey Shore"", on the other hand, will be yesterday's news at least three years from now.When sticking with the injurious gags that kept us laughing for decades, ""The Three Stooges"" succeeds in being funny, and can fortunately not be considered the monumentally bad idea many die-hard fans predicted it would be. Plus, with an appropriate rating of PG, kids will like it too.Do parents have to worry? My parents did when I was a kid, which is why, growing up, I was not allowed to watch the Three Stooges. However, the Farrelly Brothers have a disclaimer at the end that could have been seen as a cop-out, but which they also managed to make funny without being preachy. I agree with that part too: Do not try this at home.",The Three Stooges
65,ghost_dog86,Better than I thought.,6,18 April 2012,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland The line ""better than I thought"" pretty much sums up the Farrelly brother's new film ""The Three Stooges"". In a somewhat skilled exercise in juvenile/sophomoric antics, ""The Three Stooges"", directed and co-written by Bobby and Peter Farrelly (There's Something About Mary) and starring Chris Diamantopoulos (Up All Night), Sean Hayes (Will & Grace) and Will Sasso (MADtv)as Mo, Larry and Curly respectively; and co-starring Jane Lynch (Glee), Sofia Vergara (Modern Family), Larry David (Curb Your Enthusiasm), Jennifer Hudson, Kate Upton and the cast of ""Jersey Shore"", has been supposedly a long time Farrelly brothers passion project. And they do a decent job of bringing these beloved yet simplistic characters to the big screen. If nothing else, audiences will be able to tell that the Farrelly's are huge fans and as such meticulously made every aspect of this adaptation true to the original 1930's and 1940's shorts. And at times (very few times) showing parallels to ""Dumb and Dumber"", the Farrelly brothers touch definitely elevated ""The Three Stooges"" from what would have been an unwatchable satire, to an (at times) very funny slapstick romp.For the first twenty minutes, ""The Three Stooges"" is working with some very old fashioned comedy, that is quite awkward to watch and may garner no laughs. It is only when the old fashioned slapstick trio clashes with their modern surrounding that this film finds its legs (as shaky as they may be). But still, for many novice audiences, things here may become tiresome to watch, in the way that watching three grown men act infantile for 90 minutes is. But for the crowd ""The Three Stooges"" is intended for, this film, which relies heavily on pratfalls, will have enough laughs to entertain for the entirety of the movie going experience.As far as the satirical treatment the Farrelly's have given their film, as I stated before, everything is spot on. From the absurdly cruel cartoon violence inflicted by Moe, to the bone crunching sound effects produced by Curly and Larry, to the old fashioned episodic introductions, to the hokey Stooges situations which involve a Governors Ball and a banquet hall, etc. Furthermore, every actor in this film pretty much holds their own; including Kate Upton and Sophia Vergara (as much as this will pain some women to hear). In saying that, Larry David is horribly miscast as Sister Mary-Mengele. Which proves, once and for all, that Larry David, whom I am a huge fan of, is incapable of playing anybody else but Larry David.With my mixed back assessment out of the way, I will say that for a film which I was almost dreading to see, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised. In fact, the three most surprising aspects of ""The Three Stooges"" where: 1. It was Farrelly funny. Meaning, more than half of the jokes were up to par with the brilliant comic writing the Farrelly's have been known for in the past.2. Sophia Vergara steals the show! Vergara, who plays the one dimensional Latin character on ""Modern Family"" (and in real life) and has been God-awful in films such as ""New Year's Eve"" and ""The Smurfs"", absolutely shines here with grade A comic timing.3. The actors who played Moe, Larry, and Curly where extremely well cast. In fact, from time to time, when a joke wouldn't hit or a saw to the forehead would come off as hokey, the near perfect impressions will keep lovers of The Stooges, in some state of nostalgia throughout.Side Note: There were rumors that the likes of Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Jim Carrey were set to star in this film, presumably in the place of Hayes, Diamantopoulos and Sasso, but opted out. Why? Well, IMDb will give you a few reasons, which sound made up at best, because after seeing the finished product, in this reviewers opinion, the writing wasn't really worthy of A list stars. Cut and dry.Final Thought: Movies like ""The Three Stooges"" showcase what the Farrelly brothers do best. That is, take material or characters that are not necessarily worth a feature length film and provide enough pathos as to allow even the most hardened move-goer to find some entertainment value in the simple story arc. And even though many of the jokes here may seem dated, forgettable or just down-right not funny, for the millions of fans who are sure to buy tickets, ""The Three Stooges"" does deliver on a very April film release kind of way.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

66,ultramatt2000-1,A Guilty Pleasure,8,18 May 2012,"I know the Farley Brothers are fans of those guys and said that the Stooges were their comic influence. I understand that. I saw DUMB AND DUMBER and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. They have a Stooge-like feel to it. When I heard an announcement about the new movie, I thought to myself, ""What time is it?"" ""Not going to work o'clock."" When I heard about the plot, saying it will take place in modern times. I was turned off, despite the preview. I showed the preview to my friends, and they agree with me on how stupid the ideas was. It is surly not going to work at all. If the story took place in the 1930's, post World War II (late forties), or 1950's, then it would work very well! I saw it at the day THE AVENGERS came out (at that time, my right arm was beginning to look like those of Popeye's because I was animating a lot). I saw it and it was very funny. It has a feel of a Stooges short. I am not going to give it way, you have to see it in order to understand it (even though if you are a Stooges fan). Now the things that bothered me were the fact that it took place in modern times, a lion's testicles are shown, a rat comes down some lady's cleavage and modern day pop-culture references, like the scene where he called the butler C3-PO. I chuckled, but with Moe being on THE JERSEY SHORE, made me laugh. Because anything that is anti-Jersey Shore makes my day (i.e. I am not a fan of the show). With those two scenes, it would look like it is going to end up with a PG-13 rating. I did some math, after watching the film. It takes place in 2012 (i.e. the present) go 25 years back, they are ten year-old kids, so it is 1987. Go back 10 years it is 1977, they arrived to the orphanage as babies. Something wrong in this film? I know, but somehow I like, because it is very funny. I heard from online reviews, and when I saw what the hub-bub was all about, I enjoyed it. It is a guilty pleasure. So give it a watch I recommend it. 8 out of 10. Good job Farley Brothers.Rated PG for some language, traditional slapstick violence, crude humor and some scenes that might give it a PG-13 rating (i.e. sexual references).",The Three Stooges
67,gregeichelberger,"Despite some nyuks, true Stooge fans will likely be disappointed",4,11 April 2012,"I suppose the main question about this update is will the ridiculously violent, but often hilarious slapstick comedy of Moses and Jerome Horiwitz and Louis Feinberg translate onto the modern screens of 2012.Of course, I am writing about Moe and Curly Howard and their third wheel, Larry Fine, who became the Three Stooges (after breaking away from comedian Ted Healy) and began making a series of short (20 minute two-reelers) features in 1933.While Moe was the self-appointed leader (and used that power to slap, poke, gouge, crack, punch and bop the others at will), it was his younger brother, Curly, who has achieved pop culture status and is revered to this day for his wild, man-child antics. He was the darling of the troupe even in his era, from '33 to 1946, when years of bad living and alcoholism led to a debilitating stroke.Moe and Larry carried on, first with Moe's older brother, Samuel (Shemp), Joe Besser and, finally, ""Curly Joe"" DeRita. After over 200 short films, Columbia decided to cease production, thus ending the long career of the trio. In 1959, however, reruns of the old features became popular on television and introduced a whole new generation to the Stooges' goofiness.Revitalized, they finally began making the full feature films denied to them for so long by their studio (with DeRita in the Curly role). For years thereafter, children (including this author) would come home from school and watch a full hour (three shorts) of this team which fits somewhere between the Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello on my personal funny meter.A critically-acclaimed TV movie was made in 2000, and now, the Farrelly brothers (Peter and Bobby) have put their love of this troupe into wide theatrical release with Chris Diamantopoulos (various TV series, including ""The Sopranos"" and a voice on ""American Dad"") as Moe (ironically, he was born on May 9, 1975, five days after the real Moe passed away); Will Sasso (""Best Of Show,"" ""Mad TV"") as Curly; and Sean Hayes (""Will & Grace"") as Larry.The plot is simple: the trio is abandoned as infants at an orphanage run by various nuns (some in drag). The sisters, including ""Glee's"" Jane Lynch and Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson, soon grow tired of the bad behavior, which include all of the slapstick the original troupe performed. The three grow up and are forced to earn $830,000 to save the home from foreclosure.Like in many of the old black and white shorts, the bumbling, but good-hearted gang seems to be hopelessly over their heads and in danger of complete failure. However, luck seems to be on their side and they often triumph over the odds (despite themselves).Here, they run into an old friend from the orphanage, uncover a sinister murder plot and split up over some petty disagreement. This break allows Moe to make an appearance on the ""Jersey Shore"" program, and these are easily the most hilarious sequences of this movie. To see Moe slapping and punching idiots like Snooki, Mike, The Situation, Jennifer and Vinnie around almost makes up for the picture's shortcomings.Almost.True Stoogeaholics will most likely long to be watching one of the original shorts instead of spending time on this one (which is divided into three titled segments). The jokes are clearly stuck in the 1930s while the boys are supposed to exist in the present day. Also, the painful physical humor and aggression that long ago audiences enjoyed may not translate well to modern, politically-correct sensibilities.I fit somewhere in the middle here. While Diamantopoulos has an amazing resemblance to Moe and Sasso does a pretty good Curly, these are not the real Three Stooges I grew up loving and laughing at. Still, it was not a bad homage to them, either. The Farrelly's clearly know (and seem to love) their subjects, and certainly no disrespect is shown here, and the supporting cast seems to be having a lot of fun, as well.A silly disclaimer prologue, however, has the Farrelly's actually instructing the audience not to imitate the scenes in the movie. ""This hammer is made of rubber, see?"" says Peter. ""You should never hit someone in the head with a real hammer.""Really ...?",The Three Stooges
68,kevinxirau,A heart-warming slap-fest!,9,16 August 2012,"Everyone's favorite trio of slap-happy knuckle heads are back with a vengeance. For years, Moe, Larry, and Curly (among other stooges) have entertained and brought many laughs to people around the world regardless if the episodes are in black and white or, more recently, in color. The simple formula of slapstick and puns made icons out of these job-seeking idiots and now that same formula has been brought back into the modern world with an all-new adventure.Plot: When three new infant arrivals are delivered to a Catholic orphanage, the local nuns find themselves having their hands full with the outrageous Moe, Larry, and Curly. Given their quirky and chaotic personalities, the Stooges have proved to be unsuited for adoption. Years later, when the orphanage is threatened to be closed down, the trio sets out to earn enough money to save their home, but their rough, comical nature wreaks havoc and they soon find themselves caught up in a sinister plot. Can the Stooges' crazy antics save the day? The simple story works for the Three Stooges movie as in the original series, the episodes had relatively basic plots. What really matters is if the new actors can live up to the task of not only looking the part, but also sounding and acting the part. And boy do they not only succeed, but they excel at being the Stooges! Everything about the them is done perfectly and they must have taken hours of practice. Every line, every look, every slapping, eye-poking, hair-ripping, tool-breaking thing you can think of plus more. I swear, I was laughing my way through the entire film and that says a lot.Comedy is top notch as they come up with some of the most creative jokes I have ever heard or seen in my entire life; who says you need foul language or sexual jokes to be funny? Seeing the Stooges interact with the modern world was a real treat to watch, naturally leading to some more hilarious moments. The classic sound effects and music from the original series have also returned and are still a delight to hear. The other characters are good enough, each having their own funny moments and interactions with the Stooges. To my udder surprise, there's some compelling emotional depth to the film as well as there are moments throughout the movie that actually moved me a little, which is not an easy thing to do.What else can I say about this? With the original formula mixed in with more modern elements, The Three Stooges movie is guaranteed to bring back the old joy we had with the original series. As we move on into the future, some things continue to stand the test of time and the Stooges are no exception. Check out this resurrected classic-made-film and enjoy!

Moses was turning over in his grave!",The Three Stooges
70,patsworld,A Dreadful Waste Of Time,1,23 April 2012,"I will begin this review with the confession that I never like the Three Stooges. Why did I go to this movie? I thought perhaps if more likable actors were chosen to represent the T.S., it would all be better. They were. It wasn't. Not only was the movie boring, un-entertaining, dull, but the last few minutes are comprised of the folks who produced this mess contributing their share of the dumbing down of society. They exhibited the rubber props and cautioned anyone with a head so empty of intelligence as to even want to try any of the idiotic stunts from the movie, that it is all pretend, not real, and not to be tried at home. Even showed us ignorant folk that the famous eye pokes are not real. No-one's eyes are actually poked, but made more real by sound effects. WellI'm sure any kids or grownups interested in trying to recreate any of this stupidity are now more than sufficiently forewarned and the movie makers have properly covered their behinds. Now nobody from our litigious society can come after them - just in case. To sum it up, I would have to say.Don't Go.Stay Home.See Another MovieDon't Waste Your TimeIt's Not Worth Watching.",The Three Stooges
71,Ajtlawyer,awful,1,13 May 2012,"Fortunately I didn't take my girlfriend to see this mess because I got up and left an hour into it and had she gone with me it would've been twice as much a waste of money. The movie is just a lame reenactment of some of the original Stooges' shtick but adding in a bunch of insults towards Catholicism and ""updating"" the routines with more scatological references than could've been done by the original Stooges. And Jennifer Hudson, an Oscar winner, consented to be in this mess? Most of the anti-Catholic bashing is done by Larry David who is Sister Mary-Mengele (ha ha! Let's name a nun after a Nazi war criminal!). The Farrelly Brothers have had a lot of success with past movies like ""Shallow Hal"" and ""Me, Myself & Irene"" but they might've run themselves out of the business with this dreck.",The Three Stooges
72,s_campanale,"An interesting experiment more than a film, yielding mixed results.",6,25 April 2012,"I'm someone who falls into the category of life-long Three Stooges fan, so I was naturally quite excited (and curious) when I heard about this movie, especially when I saw it was being directed by latter-day laugh- meisters The Farelly Brothers. We are not going to get it here in the UK until late July, but fortunately a friend had obtained a copy which I have just watched. Right from the outset, the very idea of making a feature length Three Stooges movie set in the present day with imitators makes the film more of a conceptual experiment than an actual film, rather like the infamous Gus Van Sant ""Psycho"" recreation. The actors playing the Stooges, while not resembling them physically, make an excellent tribute act, capturing the spirit of the long dead stars and bringing them back to life for the modern audience. The Farelleys also do a good job of name-checking and recreating some of the Stooges famous routines. The eye pokes, hits, redecoration becomes destruction routine, lousy business ideas, getting squirted in the face, random animal abuse (done for real in the originals alas!), crazy vehicles, cartoonish use of explosives and a racing off into the distance ending, are all present and correct. This part of the movie works well. It is what has been added on that creates problems. The original movies were 15-20 minutes long, and had a basic high concept plot, explained in the first few seconds by supporting actors, upon which the three then incorporated several of their well-rehearsed routines, and they did not so much end as simply finish on a random punch line or gag. There was next to no character development because there was no need for these characters to develop – They were the mythopoeic agents of chaos and destruction, wrecking the pretensions and hypocrisy of those who lived only to raise their social station and conform to their society's norms, be they the nouveau riche, the law, the army, academia, medicine, or business. Yet at the same time they too had pretensions of their own, of skill and ability which they obviously did not possess, and so they were unwitting agents of destruction just as guilty as their victims, together bringing the whole silly civilized house of cards falling on their heads in the classic tradition of satire and comedy. One thing notably absent from their films was pathos and sentimentalism. One or two films had elements of this, cute kids or old ladies in need of help, where the Stooges were hired for their skill not their absence of it, but these were far and few between because they did not work in the basic theme outlined above. One can understand why, in making a full length feature film in 2012, they should introduce the ""loser finds out it's all about relationships and friendship, learns life lessons and becomes a better person who knows what really matters"" plot line. After all, the Farelleys virtually patented this structure in the modern cinema, but not only is this structure the complete antithesis of everything the Stooges stood for, but it's also now as old-hat and shop-worn as slapstick itself. It undercuts the brilliant work done by actors and directors in recreating the Stooges to then put them into so formulaic and tired a storyline. There is even a sick little girl and her best friend sub-plot which seems to be played completely straight, heightening what is already a dangerously high sugar count to almost fatal levels. Commercially it all makes sense, appealing to current audience taste and guaranteeing box office, but it makes what could have been something truly exciting into something ordinary and routine, a Farellely Brothers film featuring the Three Stooges rather than a Three Stooges film directed by the Farelleys. The noted ""Three short films"" structure is a nice nod to the originals but doesn't work as it is simply dividing up a single narrative into the usual three act structure rather than giving us three self-contained adventures. Jane Lynch, one of the funniest women in the world, plays straight woman here, and the main plot does indeed seem to be ""borrowed"" from the Blues Brothers. If it had been left as a ""high concept"" peg on which to hang the Stooges craziness, as in the originals, that would have been fine, but it's played out for real, just like the ""Postman always rings twice"" murder storyline, both of which become more important than the Stooges themselves .Adding ""Jersey Shore"" is an attempt to be very cutting edge and at the same time put some of the old anarchy into it, but it doesn't work either. The brothers dip their toes into the water so many times, only to pull back out again rather than go in. I hope I have not been too harsh on this film. It is obviously a labour of love, and a tribute to some of the greatest comedians of all time, with excellent recreations. It's simply that the result is so formulaic, hackneyed, unoriginal, and horribly sentimental and schmaltzy. But if it makes young people more aware of the originals, and brings them back into fashion (as cover versions do with the originals) then all the better for it.",The Three Stooges
73,Jim-500,A nice surprise for this Stooges fan!,8,20 May 2012,"I was unsure whether I wanted to see this movie or not. Like many Stooges fans, I was worried that the filmmakers were treading on hallowed ground. When I saw a preview that seemed to make Curly look like a little sissy, my fears only deepened.But through a string of coincidences one day, I found myself sitting in the theater with about 30 other people. The flick had been out for a while and the audiences had begun to dwindle.I was pleasantly surprised! I really enjoyed this movie. It had plenty of original material, as well as many gags that I (and I'm sure other inveterate stooges fans) could recognize from the old movies.I was very happy with Moe and Curly's portrayals; Larry, less so, unfortunately. The actor really didn't get Larry's voice and mannerisms down that well. Curly was excellent, and Moe was uncanny! The movie was so enjoyable that I didn't even mind the Farrelly's descent into toilet humor a few times during the show. It's a shame that the final crises had to be solved this way, but this is the 21st century and the audience enjoyed it, so what the heck.Speaking of the audience, that's what made it truly fun. People were laughing hysterically, and even though it was a small crowd, you couldn't help but join in.The only real miscue I found in the movie was the under-use of the sound effects. In the old movies, they were so important to getting the laughs. The original crew knew this and would crank up the volume so they actually became part of the show. But in this movie, the sound effects are on the quiet and dainty side. Not good for a slapstick movie!",The Three Stooges
74,robertmaybeth,Rated too low and that's unfair!,8,17 September 2020,"The makers of this film realized the essence of what made the Stooges funny: good old slapstick violence. Knowing the actors weren't hurt making this, at least not intentionally, goes a long way towards the humor. Even so, as a kid my parents wouldn't let us watch the old black and white Stooges, which of course meant I had to watch every episode later. And if you're the right kind of humor, the Stooges are still pretty funny. Who else could have invented the classic stooges moves, including the venerable 3-at-a-time slap-fests, the rebounding punches, the goofy sound effects, and the ridiculous falls that no human alive could endure unharmed?And that's basically what you get in this movie, a vehicle for the stooges to punch, hit with a hammer, slap, kick, and in general commit mayhem on each other with occasional guest stars along for the ride. While the rest of the world has moved on, in that the plot takes place modern-day, the Stooges are still stuck in a 1930's time-warp; haircuts, clothing and vernacular are pretty much intact from the 1930's with everyone completely unaware of it... but I wouldn't want the Stooges any other way. The actors - Sean Hayes (Larry) Will Sasso (of Mad TV, as Curly) and Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) - thoroughly understand the characters and all of them do a convincing portrayal. Admittedly this movie has a pretty weak plot to it, and the physical gags start to get repetitive towards the end, but the basic elements of a Stooges movie are here, and that's all that counts. I hope if and when the inevitable sequel comes, they try at least a little to make a slightly better plot - because if they do, this will be the perfect retro movie. for all Stooges fans.",The Three Stooges

They must have spent a lot of time watching the old shows with the originals because they really did act, sound and even to some extent look just like them.This is pure slapstick from olden days and it may not be for everyone but it is certainly an honest remake.

76,amethystwings32,fair,4,15 May 2012,I was not sure that I was going to like this movie at all. But I found that it was almost as funny as the real stooges were. The timing was good and the people that they picked were quite comical. That was my mom's take on the remake of the 3 chuckle heads! I too being a fan of the stooges found myself a skeptic! But it turned out to be almost a funny as the classic kings of slap stick humor. Though there was really only the original comical threesome! This movie comes to a close second. So if you are a true fan this movie is not for you ! But if you want second hand comedy and aren't a true chuckle head at heart . Then this is the movie for you.,The Three Stooges
77,jefflouvre-435-77367,Excessive slapstick but movie surprises with film-noir tint and pro-Obama sentiment,5,11 August 2012,"FANS of The Three Stooges will not be disappointed with the excessive slapstick humor that predominates this flick. Some will come in knowing what to expect, and others new to this brand of humor may laugh aloud at the beginning, and soon find it repulsive. The guy behind me in the theater at KLCC could not contain his raucous laugh, and I wondered how long the flick could prod him to continue laughing. The main theme of this flick is the undying loyalty between the three friends, who grew up in an orphanage and will always there for one another. However, for an oddball movie, I found the plot mildly complex and sprouting pro-Democratic (Obama) propaganda. The trio sets out to seek funds to save the orphanage from being closed down because it could not pay its insurance bills. This cries out for the universal health care package introduced by Obama and which caused great controversy among Republicans. The flick also mentions the debilitating economic crisis. The assassination plot in a ""dumb"" flick is totally unexpected. The movie actually enters territory more accustomed to film noir, with a femme fatale who's bursting at the seams with a desire to corrupt any man who falls for her charm.For me, the presence of model Kate Upton was worth the the price of the ticket.",The Three Stooges

While THE THREE STOOGES isn't art by any means, it is certainly entertaining and something to watch with the whole family. The antics are cartoonish, so kids nor adults won't find it offensive. Cute story line and some very funny scenes during the 92 minutes. The actors do very well with the material. Nice to see Sofia Vergara even if she's kind of typecast. With her accent and look there's really no other roles for her to play, and she does this well. Look for Stephen Collins still looking good in his older years. Jane Lynch plays down her persona very well. Glad she didn't over play this. Be sure and watch the extras on the DVD. Very entertaining. A couple of bits that were deleted should have been kept in the movie, but I guess the director and producers wanted to keep the run time down. Again, nice to see a film that makes you happy instead of gloomy as so many recent films have made me feel.",The Three Stooges
80,comicman117,The Three Knuckheads,7,15 April 2012,"The Three Stooges (2012). Directed by the Farrelly Brothers, Starring Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, Chris Diamantopoulos, Jane Lynch, Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Hudson, Craig Berko, Stephen Collins and Larry David.Now let me start by saying that the Three Stooges (2012) is by no means a bad movie, in fact it is surprisingly a good movie, although not laugh out loud funny.The idea of updating the Three Stooges for a modern audiences (and this is coming from a big three stooges fan), doesn't seem like a good idea, but the Farrelly Brothers make it work to a certain extent. The brothers have said many times in interviews that they are big fans of the Three Stooges, and you can definitely see that in this film.The plot - The plot follows the three stooges as they attempt to save their orphanage from being bought. The film is structured like three episodes of the Three Stooges that are all interconnected. They even go as far as to make a new title card for each one. The first one set ups the majority of the plot, explaining that the Three Stooges had been raised in the orphanage there whole life, and that's why they want to save it. The second episode involves the Three Stooges agreeing to kill a man who is dying of a disease, even going as far to visit him in the hospital, because they were promised a large sum for it. The third episode involves Moe being a cast member on the reality show Jersey Shore, the entire structure of this part of the film pokes fun at Reality Shows, and how idiotic they really are. They will do anything to get good ratings.The humor - the humor for this film is hit and miss although a lot of it does work well. A good number of it is the Stooges own trademark slapstick, but thankfully it doesn't take up 100% of the film (it would get kind of repetitive after a while). Some of the funniest gags (at least for me personally) are in the third segment where Moe keep abusing the cast of Jersey Shore. Another funny gag occurs at the Zoo where we literally get to see a lion's ball. My favorite joke in the film is the response that Craig Berko's character says to Sofia Vergera when she tells him that the ""three idiots"" are here. He responds, ""the Kardashian sisters""? There's some unnecessary humor in the second segment when the Three Stooges are in a hospital, and have to clean babies. Does this film really need moments of toilet humor? It felt kind of forced.The casting is flawless, the three leads (Chris Diamantopulus, Will Sasso, and Sean Hayes) are spot on, enough that you may actually think that they are the real stooges. Jane Lynch is good although a little wasted as the head of the church Mother Superior. Jennifer Hudson is only in the film for a few minutes, but she does get the chance to sing. Larry David is hilarious as a female nun who clearly despises the stooges (in drags and all) constantly calling them idiots for all of the dumb things they do. Sofia Vergera is annoying as a female villain, although she does have a great butt.Another complaint I had was the ending where the Farrelly Brothers (or the bodybuilders impersonating them) had to do this whole, ""don't try this stuff at home thing"". I think it could have been funnier if one of the Farrelly brothers (I forget which one was being used as a subject) actually got hit on the head with a real hammer, and fell down (they could have prepped it beforehand). Overall a pretty good time. I was very surprised. If you're looking for a film that can educate you, then don't see it, but if you want to be entertained and are a big fan of the Three Stooges, I highly recommend you check it out.7/10",The Three Stooges

You really have to give credit to the Farrelly Brothers for truly bringing to life one of the greatest comedy acts of all time and doing it right. The three actors that play the Stooges (Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes and Will Sasso) are also one of the best things about this film.The plot is simple enough: when their orphanage is being threatened of being closed down, the Three Stooges makes it their life's mission to raise enough money to save the orphanage, their only home.Great performances from the supporting cast well. My only complaint would be the beginning with the Stooges as kids. But that's only a minor complaint.

I laughed out loud a lot and at times I was in tears laughing! You need to keep your eyes open as an adult viewer - there are lots of oblique and hysterical references! Came home and treated myself and my 9 year old son to some original Three Stooges on You Tube, and boy was that funny too! We loved it. So now we have discovered the Three Stooges! The film is very faithful to the original stuff. Only slight query I had with this film is the guns (and the Three Stooges buying in to a potential murder...), which, if young children are going to watch it - it doesn't need.

87,paulsrobinson,Proves the stooges are still funny,6,21 May 2013,"I am not that familiar with the original Three Stooges, I had obviously heard of them and seen clips which i did find amusing. But i did suspect that the particular brand of comedy would be come tedious over a full length feature. Which this film at time did confirm for me, but did also tickle me at times.The story separated in to 3 acts or episodes as called in the film in which i found is in reference to how the originals short films were packaged for TV. Adopting a similar story to The Blues Brothers, the Stooges have lived in an orphanage their whole lives and they must leave to earn money to save said Orphanage. The casting for is actually very good as the 3 actors Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes and Will Sasso are suited to the characters and made up enough to look like the original actors. Also based on who else were linked to the roles during it's development hell particularly Benicio del Toro, and Sean Penn. Acknowledging they are fantastic actors but it may have taking me out of the movie a little at the surprised casting. Also special mention has to be made towards Larry David who played Sister Mary-Mengele who was absolutely hysterical at times.What i did not like was as previously mentioned the constant slapstick comedy, which is funny. Does become very predictable with it's repetitiveness and also the obvious attempt to freshen up the old school Three Stooges by bringing in the cast of jersey Shore. Which honestly was funny at times but seemed like a desperate attempt to drag them into the 21st century and for me will age the film horribly when Jersey shore disappears and becomes forgotten.In the end an OK attempt at bringing the Stooges up to date, but ends up more like a music cover band.",The Three Stooges
88,FFman-847-460126,Why would you remake the Three Stooges?,2,13 April 2012,"I can guarantee you that no one aside from the Farrelly brothers thought that remaking The Three Stooges was a good idea. With money behind them, the cast and crew only showed up for nothing but the paycheck. In the end, the Farrelly brothers decided to be creative and make the movie even worse than it should have been. How did they do that? They incorporated the cultural trash that is Jersey Shore. Quite unexpectedly, Jersey Shore became a key element of the movie—making it far worse than expected.The Three Stooges—the original—were good because they were pioneers of a new form of comedy. Many decades later, the comedy of banging someone over the head has run dry. You cannot bring back pioneers decades later and expect the same result. Sure, this movie might have been funny back in the right era. But that era is long gone. This kind of humor is dead.With the humor a dud, the movie had to rely on plot and acting. It didn't even try. The acting is so terrible that it looks like the Farrelly brothers never allowed for there to be a second take on any scene. Then again, they might have. The script was so horribly written and filled with cliché plot points that it would be difficult for any actor to take it seriously—no matter how many takes.The Three Stooges is part of the studio practice of pumping the minimal dollar amount into a movie, targeting an audience, and pocketing the profit. There are enough people who still love the original Three Stooges to make a profit. Those involved in this movie likely knew that it was a sham and should never have been made. Real actors should never accept a script like this one. It has tainted my perception of a few actors—namely Jane Lynch.There is no reason to see this movie. Just don't do it. By seeing it, you are encouraging the studios to push more and more garbage on us. If you are a fan of the original Three Stooges, go back and watch the original Three Stooges. In a few months, this move will be released on DVD. At that point, you should steal a copy (Do not buy—they do not deserve your money), gather a bunch of fans of the original Three Stooges, and burn the movie in effigy.

If you are a fan of the original Three Stooges shorts and are open minded you will enjoy this movie. The Farrley Brothers certainly captured the spirit and essence of the original Three Stooges shorts. And kudos to Chris Diamantopoulos (Moe), Sean Hayes (Larry) and Will Sasso (Curly), plus a great supporting cast for bringing the feel and spirit of the originals back. I didn't think it was possible to recreate the chemistry of the original Three Stooges, who were absolute comedic geniuses but Peter and Bobby Farrley have done exactly that. I set my sights a bit low on this, but from the very beginning when the Three Stooges, who began the picture as toddlers, were delivered... well actually thrown onto the porch of am orphanage in a large canvas tote bag, I laughed out loud and continued to do so for the next 92 minutes. This won't challenge your intellect but it certainly won't bore you. Too bad it didn't deliver as expected in the box office (it's domestic take was $44.3 million against a $30 million budget) so we most-likely won't see a sequel, although I would love one. I hope DVD/Blu Ray sales help Fox and the production companies recover their budget and distribution/marketing expenses.

The boys have to raise nearly a million dollars to save the orphanage in which they were raised. They don't have a band to put back together, so they hit the road seeking ways of to save their beloved home. Along the way, the boys bumble their way into a sordid tale of sex, lies and murder. For those of you worried about the appearance of the Jersey Shore crew, don't worry. They aren't on screen that often and when they are, they're usually getting smacked around by Moe.If you don't find this movie funny, then there must be too much iron in your drinking water.",The Three Stooges
91,mldardar,A great homage & accomplishment wasted on humans of 2012!,9,5 September 2021,"I don't understand people these days. Sure, what's falling-out your seat hilarious to some, won't even get a smile from others--duds/dead-heads of modern society. Everyone connected with this movie did their jobs to perfection! Just the idea of Larry David being cast as a nun is funny, but he pulled it off perfectly. But the hardest shoes to fill were the 3 Stooges, & the 3 new actors nailed it. The lines were pure Stooges.And Sofia Vergara proved way back then that she could be hilarious. I guess the Farrelly bros sensed that people were too bland to receive it well, so didn't film it with sequels in mind. A real shame. Perhaps if it would've been made these days, it might've had a chance as a mini-series on Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu. My wife & I loved it, & she didn't grow up watching the originals--Moe, Larry & Curly or Shemp. A mini-series could've had someone play Shemp in some episodes because he & Curly were equally funny. Well, hopefully someone in the future will give it another shot.",The Three Stooges

They grew up coddled by the nuns (Jane Lynch, Jennifer Hudson, Larry David) but were rambunctious and ill disciplined. After thirty-five years there, they grew up to be the handymen around the grounds.One day, the Monsignor (Bryan Doyle-Murray) arrives and gives the nuns 30 days to come up with $830,000 or be evicted. All the orphans will be sent to foster homes. So our boys are off to the big city to raise the money. But they've never been out in the world and never interacted with anyone but nuns and children. Will they have the maturity and savvy to save the day?""The Three Stooges"" is the Farrelly brothers' attempt the rekindle the spark that was the classic comedy team from the 1930s – 1960s. And to my mind, they succeeded in spades. The movie is very true to the original in every way. The slapping, hitting, kicking, and yanking on virtually every body part is duplicated by Diamantopoulos, Hayes, and Sasso to perfection. Only a team who truly loved the Stooges could create such a faithful homage.The curious thing about this film is that it is aimed at youngsters. The previews included several cartoons and Disney features soon to come. There were no swears and hardly any blue humor. (There were some very funny law firm names that only adults would appreciate.) There is a certain amount of gross out humor. And there is an appearance of the ""Farelly Brothers"" at the end, imploring children not to attempt Stooge antics at home. I was hoping for a more adult film, aimed at the audience that grew up with the Stooges.There isn't much more to say about this film. If you love the Stooges, you will find an incredibly accurate recreation of the highly choreographed poking, prodding, and impaling you grew up with. If you have never seen the Stooges, you will probably find the film simplistic and sophomoric.In either case, there is no good reason to rush out and see it on the big screen. So, for a Fine (sic) recreation of the original, but a tad on the kiddie side, I recommend you wait for the instant download.",The Three Stooges
93,tyreeewebster,Retrospective Reviews- The Three Stooges (2012),7,13 July 2012,"From the creators of 'Dumb and Dumber' comes possibly the best comedy I've ever seen.This film is the first comedy I've seen in a while that has made me actually laugh out loud (this and the 'Hangover' movies) but it's the only comedy I've seen that doesn't need to be raunchy or overly vulgar to get a laugh out of me. It just has to be silly and fun, and that's EXACTLY what comedy stands for.PROS: Let's talk about the story... it's very simple, the orphanage where the 3 Stooges (Moe, Larry and Curly) grew up is on the verge of being shut down unless it can raise $83, 000 to save it, so the trio decide that they should do it. Of course, the Stooges' Vaudeville act mainly consists of slaps and eye pokes, so obviously they wouldn't be able to carry a full 91 minute film, so what the writers/directors have done is split the 3 act film into 3 27 minute episodes, but they all add up to one story, and it works very well. Every episode is different and offers a lot of very funny stuff. I'm not quite sure how the original Stooges acted or sounded like, but I'm sure the actors in this film did them justice. Here we have Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe, Will Sasso as Curly and Sean Hayes as Larry, all giving brilliantly funny performances as their respected characters, but, if anything, Will Sasso steals the show.CONS: Surprisingly, I have nothing negative to say about this movie, it's just one of those well made comedies.So, what can I say? This movie was well written, well directed and well acted, and just goes to show you that you shouldn't judge a film by its trailer. So, if you're ever bored or are just sick and tired of vulgar sex ""comedies"" or Judd Apatow flicks, give this a watch. It's entertaining and hilarious.Directed by: Bobby Farelly & Peter FarellyWritten by: Mike Cerrone,Bobby Farelly & Peter Farelly Starring: Chris Diamantopoulos, Will Sasso & Sean Hayes",The Three Stooges
94,mikezexcel,You'd have to be a sourball not to laugh,10,30 April 2012,"I thought THE 3 STOOGES was hilarious from beginning to end. From the very first scenes with Larry David, to the homage with the horses at the end, this film captured the Stooges humor in a terrific modern update. The actors were so spot on it was uncanny. Hayes didn't look exactly like Larry, but his speech and actions were excellent. Curly was probably the weakest recreation, probably because the original was truly one-of-a-kind. That magic is impossible to capture, but Sasso was fine throughout. Moe by Chris Diamantopoulos was sheer genius. I have never seen such an uncanny recreation by an actor in my life. I'd hand him the Oscar right now! I'm sure I have not laughed as much and as hard at a movie since THE WEDDING CRASHERS. I don't know how you can make it through this film with a stone face. Even just the anticipation of a scene about to unfold - such as the Stooges entering a pediatric ward - had me laughing in advance at the set-up. Anyone who complains about the story or plot elements would never be a real Three Stooges fan. Plausible situations being thrown to the wind are part and parcel of their comedy. With just the opening scenes, when the Stooges age from infants to adults while the supporting characters (David, Jennifer Hudson, etc) remain the same age, I was already on board for their ridiculous brand of ""reality"". This is Stooges genius at its best.The Farrelly Brothers get my highest praise for making this thoroughly enjoyable film!",The Three Stooges
95,tonyjea92,This Was COITENLY a Dead Homage to the Original,9,13 April 2012,"I am A Huge stooge fan the non-stop slapstick of these three are hilarious . Moe,Larry and Curly i consider the three wise-men of comedy and to me they can never be topped as comedians. This ""new"" generation of three stooges is really nothing different as far as Moe slapping Curly or the three of them all together causing accidents. But what is kinda new is that the movie revolves around a different plot of sorts, one that involves Murder. I wont spoil much but basically if you've seen an innocent person get wound up in a murder plot between husband and wife then the 3 stooges aren't gonna surprise any one. I say this movie has great potential as being one of the earliest comedies in 2012 maybe even the best comedy film in the last 5 years",The Three Stooges
96,xodanielcasterox,Why?,3,17 September 2013,"I f#cking loved the three stooges ever since I was a chubby 11-year-old kid. The slapstick is the kind of humor I've always admired and I still admire today. They were the definitive icons of slapstick. When I heard they were making a movie about them I thought, oh god...no... Because somewhere in my mind I had a feeling that they were gonna botch this one. But when I read it's directed by the guy who did dumb and dumber, surprise surprise! it sucked! there's so many things wrong with this movie and a small few things right. I'll start with the right things: Moe, Larry and Curly. The actors looked and acted exactly like the three stooges; the slapstick is good and gave me some minor chuckles. It kind of felt like I really was watching the old gang I know and love. But with that said here are the wrong things: The rest of the humor outside the slapstick is stupid annoying and had no business being in a stooges movie; The scene at the beginning when Peezer is talking to the sick little girl Murph about someone picking him up from the orphanage, Murph says ""Your not the only one who watch his parents drown. Dude, that happens!"" And Peezer is like, ""I know."" Why did Murph say that? Is that supposed to be funny? It's not! That was just downright mean! And we're suppose to sympathize her? Are you kidding me? What a little b!tch; How come the nuns never aged when the three stooges got older?; The kids singing in the very beginning before moe larry and curly arrive was pointless and unfunny; why is the jersey shore in this?; why is the acting wooden apart from moe larry and curly?; Why do they still want us to hope that Murph will survive the sickness after we just heard her say the most @sshole thing to another orphan?; why was there a message clip at that very end about how the tools are proved fake? Are the parents just too f*cking lazy to tell their kids that they were fake themselves?; why was there a baby pissing in the face joke and constantly trying to hammer in it?; Moe on a reality TV show. wait what?; how come when moe larry and curly reunite the producer of jersey shore is surprised that there are three of them when he clearly some them arguing before he gave Moe the opportunity to be on the show? even the crew off camera of jersey shore are as moronic as the cast; where did the horses at the end right before the stupid message come from? There are so many plot holes in this movie that even the Garbage Pail kids movie would analyze and address. Yes. I just said that. This movie is true to the slapstick and characters but doesn't care about what is going outside the slapstick or what you think of it. It's not one of the worst movies I've ever seen but it's still pretty bad. Just stick to the original shorts. This movie is confusing, stupid and just mean-spirited. Please don't do it again boys.",The Three Stooges
97,guasco-2,Made for the fans only.,7,14 November 2020,"The greatest difficulty in adapting a comedy like the three stooges is time lapse. Comedy has changed a lot in 70 years. Therefore, this film has an immediate uphill battle. This means that any attempt to create new ""three stooges"" fans from a film in 2012 was a long shot. A very long shot.
However, if you grew up or enjoyed the humor of a bygone era like the three stooges, this film is a fantastic homage. It's clear the Farrelly brothers truly love the three stooges and this is most clear in their choice of actors. Rather than trying to get A listers to sell tickets, they clearly chose the best actors. I honestly can't imagine anyone doing a better impression of the stooges than these three.
At the end of the day, the filmmakers had two choices: make a modern stooges film that barely looks like the originals but has some famous A listers OR get some C listers, make it very faithful to the originals, and probably not win any new fans.
The filmmakers chose the latter and I think that was the right choice.Other than a couple of jokes not landing (peeing babies and pulling out nose hairs), the film is an extremely faithful and funny recreation of the originals, plus with a few improvements in editing.",The Three Stooges
98,khfan250,Speaking as a Non-Stooge Fan.,2,23 April 2012,"Before I begin reviewing this movie, I want to debunk a few reasons as to why it's good. Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and Chris Diamantopoulus have received acclaim for their accurate portrayals of Larry, Curly, and Moe. But, as I stated in the title, I'm not a fan of The Three Stooges original show. Even as a kid, I knew slapstick humor was not my kind of comedy. I respect people that appreciate it, but I never could. So I found the actors so over-the-top that, for a while, it was quite comical. But after the first third of the movie, the mugging to the camera and over-use of the wide angle lens just got grading that it just begins to look unpleasant.Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember the original show ever having much of a constructive narrative. I remember the slapstick like everyone. And by making a movie of this requires the alcohol-influenced writers to come up with some needlessly complicated, half baked story that's neither relevant or interesting.The movie also has a lot of plot points that just come and go as they please. What do I mean by this? Well, in the first ten minutes of the movie, they establish this characters to be diagnosed with some sort of unexplained, incurable disease. The next time we see her, not only is she completely cured, but the filmmakers didn't even come up with a reason as to how she was cured!My biggest gripe with the movie comes at the very end. The directors, the Farrelly brothers, come out and explain that the slap stick is, of course, choreographed and unreal. This bothers me for a couple of reasons:1.) Wouldn't it have made sense for the Farrelly brothers to include this caution before the movie and not after?2.) I think this is slapping the audience in the face. Whenever I did watch the original t.v. show as a kid, I knew the slapstick was choreographed. I knew that you couldn't slug someone in the face with a hammer without causing serious injuries. I think kids are smarter than most people give them credit for; they know enough to separate what's real and what's unreal when it comes to cinema.One other thought is this. In his review, Roger Ebert says, and I quote, ""The Farrelly brothers have made probably the best Three Stooges movie it's possible to make in 2012"". I thought that was true at first. But, upon further thought, I came to the conclusion that, while I'm sure the Farrelly brothers were trying, this movie is just unnecessary and not fit for our times. The original show is fine, I guess, and there's absolutely no need to make it this derivative.Final verdict: Though I don't hate this movie, it's still pretty bad. If you are a Stooges fan, you could like this movie, though the constructive narrative could bug you, as it did me. Other than that, it may disappoint.",The Three Stooges
99,puffball97,"The Best Work of the Farrelly Brothers since ""There's Something About Mary""",7,13 April 2012,"Peter and Bobby Farrelly, after a long, dry spell, are back in comedic form again. For many years, their target audience was with adults with sarcastic, gross senses of humor, as demonstrated in their monster 1998 hit, ""There's Something About Mary"" that made a big star out of Cameron Diaz. Previously, there was 1994's big hit ""Dumb and Dumber,"" which had many silly, sometimes tasteless, sight gags, and Jim Carrey was a star on the rise. Now the Farrelly brothers have created a kiddie flick entitled ""The Three Stooges."" No, this is not a biography of the three slapstick comics from way back when, but what it would be like if the three comics were transported to modern times. The Farrellys have not let go of their trademark slapstick and gross-out humor, although it has been toned down for the youngsters. However, it is not altogether a kiddie flick, where there are scenes of extreme violence, a large black rat, and model Kate Upton as a nun in a revealing swimsuit, but most of all that is harmless.The story begins in 1934 where three small boys wrapped in a blanket are thrown to the doorstep of an Atlanta orphanage. Already, they are hitting the nuns, each other, and everyone else. The funny thing about these boys is that they look exactly like what they would become as adults. Running the orphanage are the straight-arrow Mother Superior (Jane Lynch), the warm and fuzzy Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson), and the ultra-tough Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David in drag, and he hams it up with enthusiasm. In fact, David played Larry the Stooge recurrently on the 1980 comedy skit show, ""Fridays."")The boys eventually grow up into dark-haired Chris Diamontopoulos as Moe, Sean Hayes with frizzy hair as Larry, and beefy Will Sasso as Curly. The plot goes as their blond good friend, Ted (Kirby Heyborne), was lovingly adopted as a child, but later on, he faces trouble, as he learns his widowed father Mr. Harter (Stephen Collins) is a shady lawyer having an affair with his alluringly conniving wife, Lydia (the sexy and curvaceous Sofia Vergara, parodying the femme fatale character). Mr. Harter, Lydia, and a goon (an oily Chris Bierko, who gets his when you look at his face near the end of the movie), are out to kill Ted for the money that his late Mom left him, and the Stooges unwittingly come to Ted's rescue. More mayhem, hits, and bruises.Like Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey in ""Dumb and Dumber,"" the Stooges are dumb lads with lots of heart, which is a typical plot device in many Farrelly Brothers mothers. The Stooges, employed as maintenance men in the orphanage they grew up in, learn that the orphanage is closing down due to economic circumstances (which definitely speaks of today's times), lose their jobs, and they will do anything to save it, which inevitably it happens, but not in their own hands. I'd have to say that brothers trying to get money for a closing orphanage was the same exact plot from the 1980's ""The Blues Brothers.""The Farrelly Brothers also work well with anachronisms as Moe is accidentally hired on today's reality show, ""Jersey Shore,"" and he seems to blend well with that cast, although they seem to find him a bit strange, and they act as though they don't want him there.If anyone thinks that ""The Three Stooges"" is all violent slapstick, think again. The three plots of the murder, the closing of the orphanage, and the reality show, are all juxtaposed intelligently and coexist so well that it can make an adult think. The original Three Stooges were known for cartoonish violence, but the Farrellys take them to different levels. The Farrellys let the actors run and knock each other around, and the result is a literal bang-up job. At the end of the movie, the children applauded and so did their parents.This movie works for me on a personal level because my sister-in-law and her three children were extras whose scene was they were onlooking one of the characters about to be run over by a bus. My mother and I went to see this with very low expectations, thinking this would be one of the stupidest movies all around, but we were both pleasantly surprised by our feelings as we walked out. Yes, there was violence, but the violence was good-natured. The Farrellys and the cast seem to have had a lot of fun doing this project, and I think that the Farrellys had the best fun since ""There's Something About Mary."" With ""The Three Stooges,"" the Farrelly's used their best imagination, and everything just worked.",The Three Stooges

I'm a Stooges aficionado so the Farrellys were preaching to the choir in my case. Love for their heroes shows in every frame (I'm not kidding) and their efforts are greatly appreciated. They very wisely went for a straight-up re-creation of the Stooge ambiance, with no reality to interfere with the comedy. Mel Gibson made a TV movie about the Stooges' real lives and I hate to criticize a fellow Stooges lover, but that was a truly awful idea. The actual Stooges were robbed mercilessly and ended up in a bad financial situation. Too depressing to watch, actually. Not what you want to see when watching a Stooges film. The Farrellys learned from Mel's mistake and just made a tribute to the comedy itself. The actors do faithful impressions of the Stooges and it's a beautiful thing to watch. The supporting cast is all in on the joke and they fit in perfectly. A true test is if the WAGs who get dragged along have a good time. Mine definitely did, and there was a lot of laughter, male and female, from the audience.

In all that time, I have seen many imitators of all 6 Stooge-members, including Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp, Joe Besser and Curly Joe deRita. In these guys (Hayes, Sasso & Diamondapoulos), I've never seen anyone come nearly as close to the original Larry Curly & Moe. And that includes the three actors who portrayed the boys in the 2000 TV-movie bio-pic. But it isn't just that. It's the Writing and Directing of the Farrelly brothers here that really does the trick. The funniest things the original comedy trio did were the rapid-fire slapping, poking and punching, set to hilariously beautiful sound-effects. That is all presented here, perhaps even more often than in the original short films of the '30s & '40s. The time is just right for all this. This is another nostalgia trip for baby-boomers like me and so many others today. Presented in the form of one continuous 90-minute story divided into three 30-minute ""short films,"" even the pace is perfect.

Clothes, music, books, movies, even silent movies, etc. I guess you could say there was no better time than now to bring us a three stooges movie. The Three Stooges give us nostalgia that has been asleep for decades. The return of true slapstick comedy, along with some great jokes in between. I cannot quite say this is a kids movie, but I am sure kids will love all the comic violence this movie is stock full of. The kids in my theatre sure did and so did the parents. The men who played the stooges were flawless. Every movement, every facial expression was spot on to the originals. You can tell the actors and the directors, worked very hard to do the original stooges justice. From the bonked noses, to the posters of each act, they did just that.

But there are plenty of legitimate larfs, some of 'm gut-busting! The audience enjoyed it and clapped at the end -- always a good sign. The lead actors did a better-than-we-had-a-right-to-expect job of capturing Stooges essence, esp. Will Sasso. And the directors got the timing right and kept the pace up (important for Stooges humor to work). Most of the key classic gags are delivered at one point or another throughout the movie, with a success rate ranging from good to perfect. Translate that to mean: no flops. Seriously, as far as the slapstick humor goes, there were no missteps. It all worked, and some of it worked SUPER well (the gut-busters)! Also, there were multiple nods to scenes from favorite original Stooges shorts, giving the aficionado plenty to feel good about.The down side: The inconsistency.

But while the humor is timed well and works throughout, there are pieces of the story that just need to go away. This may be the first movie where the better ""Director's Cut"" edition will be significantly *shorter* than the theatrical release, rather than longer.First problem: There *was* a story! I mean, a real one (if uncreative and predictable), with subplots and all that. In The Three Stooges, plot is only a frail (and ultimately irrelevant) frame to hang situations and gags on. Many of the original shorts just cut off unceremoniously at their 16.5 minute time limit, with no end to the story at all. And nobody gives a damn, 'cause it just doesn't matter. The basic story here is fine, but whoever is responsible for the part of the script where the Stooges break up and then get back together... like the writers were obligated to have character development and angst and all that crap -- which they most definitely are NOT... that guy needs to be fired retroactively, his scenes carved out and flushed down the crapper. Also needs to go: 1) the kids singing at the beginning, which just starts the audience off wondering what the Hell is going on and did they walk into the wrong theatre, and 2) all references to reality shows ('nuff said).I gave it 5 out of 10 because of that stuff. But please don't let that deter you! The acting and excellent comic timing make this worthwhile and fun. I encourage all doubter Stooges fans to go see it and enjoy the good parts, because they are very good. And if they'd just hack out the +/- 25 minutes of storyline that doesn't fit (and the signing kids bit), this would actually be an excellent 1 hr. movie -- at least a 7 of 10, maybe even an 8.In fact... After writing this, I went back and upped my IMDb rating to 6 of 10. Really, everybody involved in this deserves credit for capturing the characters so well and pulling off the humor. That aspect of it is a rousing success. And the fact that the overall package could be fixed with trimming makes me look forward to getting this into Wondershare (my video editor of choice). If they don't do a ""Director's Cut,"" I'll do a ""Fan's Cut."" ;) I may even go see this again in theatres and not wait for the disc.",The Three Stooges
112,jamfitz001,"Hard Not to Root For, But Only a Double, No Run Scored.",6,7 July 2012,"The heart of this movie is a homage to the Three Stooges. Obviously, multiple generations of us have grown up with these short films and the original antics and physical absurdist comedy contained in them have almost been ingrained into us.The three actors here are asked to mimic the exact same routines of old, and they do a fantastic job. The Farrelly brothers don't ask too much more of them than that, and the story never really gets in the way of the 'Yuk, Yuk, Yuks' and the finger poking and the hair pulling. This is simply a recreation of the old routines as a tribute, and on that level, it all works and you will at least smile recalling some of it, if not laugh out loud.The biggest flaws are in the script itself, which if it had contained some slight changes would have been greatly improved. The biggest problem is that the supporting characters and the antagonists are never really connected properly with the boys.For example, *spoiler here* Ted is a young boy who pops up out of the blue and is chosen for adoption instead of the stooges. Later he comes back into the story as an adult. But there were no scenes incorporated to show the young Ted making any sort of connection to Stooges. He is never given any motivation as to why he would help them. As adults, still at the orphanage, another young generation of orphans seem to love the boys, but there are no scenes to establish why.The same problem exists for the antagonists. Larry David plays Sister Mary Mengele, the main antagonist of the boys, set in the orphanage in which they are raised. Although she is the victim of some of the physical comedy, the character would have been more realized if she had been established as dishing out some crazy head slaps and nose pulling herself. This carries over to the main antagonist of the story, Sofia Vergara. Although the nemesis, she is more a passive witness to their antics, and never really goes toe-to-toe and delivers a level of physical abuse back at them, which would have made her character funnier and more engaged as an enemy.Although seeing a three stooges tribute movie is fun, this one just never pushes the limit at all story wise, which holds it back from being a truly great effort.",The Three Stooges

They did a great job with the film and I really enjoyed it and wasn't disappointed at all. The scene where they were disguised as nurses in the nursery was my favorite part.

I wanted to rate this movie high, because a lot of movies have high ratings, such as the Simpsons, which really was a horrible movie. I think a lot of little children rate these movies without watching them, like the Simpsons. I was expecting Stooges to be bad, so I thought I'd watch just 20 minutes, then switch to another movie with a higher rating. I found this movie to be so funny that I had to stay and finish watching the rest of it. Although I rely on the rating system here, and it usually is accurate, sometimes it's totally wrong, and this was one of those times. I recommend everyone to watch this movie.",The Three Stooges
116,afh179,You just shouldn't try a three stooges remake.,5,25 April 2012,"So, Hollywood's done just about everything at this point. It's remade, reinvented, revamped, and recreated old Hollywood hits as well as old classics of the television screen and stage. But, shockingly, this is the first time since the beloved Curly, Larry, and Moe faded into showbiz lore years ago that their side-splitting shorts have been adapted into a full-length film. What makes the film even more interesting is that the stooges now live in the present day. The problem is that the three stooges were one of a kind. Many of us can do your typical stooges impressions, but no one on this planet can capture the humor of simple slapstick comedy the way the stooges did. Here,our three lead actors put forth a wonderful effort to do so, but I almost felt wrong for watching them try. Duplicating the stooges just cannot be done, which is a big part of why this movie did not really do it for me.Putting the stooges in modern times is another reason this movie failed to live up to it's potential. The stooges were not just a group of comedians, they were the humorous outlet that many common folk used to escape the horrors of the great depression. Placing them in a modern-day setting takes a lot away from their original charm. And don't even get me started on the marketing tool that is the inclusion of the Jersey Shore airheads. Just, why? Do we really need to see these people everywhere we turn? They have no place in anything having to do with the Three Stooges, and are simply here to attract the teenage masses.All in all, this movie was not bad. It was entertaining and enjoyable but only at times, and there are a few funny instances and classic slapstick gags that will always net a chuckle or two. But the Three Stooges are legends, and their original genius work should just not be touched. The fact that they turned their classic shorts into a Hollywood production geared towards younger children is not a surprise, but it is a disappointment nonetheless. Skip this one if you're not a fan of the Stooges original work, but give it a watch if you were. It's worth the initial watch, but I know I won't be giving it any more than that.Overall: 5.5/10",The Three Stooges

This is set in the modern day where Larry, Moe, and Curly have to save the orphanage they grew up in from being shut down. Sean Hayes, Chris Diamontopolis, and Will Sasso play these characters with such vigor and enthusiasm that it's hard not to like them. They are all nearly pitch perfect in their portrayals of the original stooges. As you can guess, there are a LOT of slapstick gags here that are used for great comedic effect. There is even one scene where dummies are clearly used. It's fun to see these three idiots try to function in the real world (salmon farm anyone?). A few gripes though. The beginning of the movie where they're portrayed as kids is very slow and unfunny. Don't worry though it pays off immediately after. Some characters, while funny, we're a bit underused; and hey, some people just find this genre annoying no matter what. Also, if you hate puns you're going to hate this movie.I think the move is great. I was laughing my butt off for most of it. It is kid-friendly too, he slapstick is extremely juvenile yet well done.

This was one of the funniest comedies I have seen in literally years,funny if you are 5 or 85 and all points in between, a lovingly crafted homage that really does justice to the legacy of the Three Stooges, at times I REALLY felt like I was watching the real Three Stooges somehow miraculously back from the grave and making films in 2012, the three actors really nailed their parts and delivered the goods,they were fully committed and you could tell they were taking their roles seriously to really respect the legends they were portraying. Moe & Curly Howard and Larry Fine would be very proud. I especially think Chris Diamantopoulis portrayal of Moe is award worthy. I think strong positive word of mouth may give this some ""Moe""-mentum , pun intended, and I hope it really cleans up on DVD, I would really like to see a sequel since there is no end to the different situations you could place these guys into.",The Three Stooges

After watching the flop of a made for TV movie a few years ago, this film seemed to be doomed from the get go. Watching this movie as an avid fan of arguably the most funny, whimsical, off the cuff comedy trio of all time, the actors and storyline had a huge journey to embark upon. The acting is amazing, each actor completely submerging themselves into the character, the plot follows that of classic Three Stooges original Nintendo TV game, is a great way to draw any avid Stooges fan into the game, and comedic timing is that of pure genius. The fact they were even able to break the show down into three separate ""short"" films and incorporate the opening of each segment like the show is that of nearly accomplishing perfection. The only partial complaint I have about the movie is they had to drag the plague known as Jersey Shore into the film. With the actor portraying Moe (Diamantopoulos), the somewhat overbearing brain of the act, being relatively unknown, hit the nail on the head with his antics and demeanor. As far as Sasso's portrayal of Moe's dimwitted over weight brother on and off screen (minus the abusive antics, off the screen, of course), Curly and Haye's portrayal of the music driven crazy haired Larry both made me had new respect for the actors that I had deemed one trick ponies.

First of all, if you aren't a fan of the show, you might not like this movie, I understand that and it's fine with me. But having grown up watching the Three Stooges show every chance I got, I had to see this movie and loved it every bit as much as the show. The actors who played the stooges, both as kids and as adults, did an excellent job at portraying the characters in the original show. It was a job well done recreating the original Stooges as they really were, not just a cheap imitation. And while it may be true that the story in the movie may not be deep enough to make some people happy, the show didn't go too deep into a story either. The whole point of both the show and the movie is to entertain through the comical antics of the Stooges, both of which succeeded in my opinion. The movie is nothing more than a modern day version of the show, but definitely not less. Any true fan of the Three Stooges show will appreciate the movie, I would be surprised if they didn't.

The Acting: I can tell the three actors tried their BEST to feel like the audience was watching the original series with the originals. But they fell short. Now Here Are My Likes:1. The Comedy: The comedy was actually pretty good.

A lot of the expected happened when of lot of the unexpected could have. But that doesn't stop the ""close to the heart"" Stooges from making us laugh.I enjoyed how the Farrelly directors included a comparison of today's crap television to good ol' American traditional television. If you watch either of the shows compared, be embarrassed. You deserve it!You can't ask for much more when it comes to acting by the Three Stooges, honestly it was brilliantly executed. Although Will Sasso has to be shaking his head wondering, ""Why do my hands curl up in every scene?""The cinematography could have used some love, just a little extra to add to the quality of the film. We could have used some aging, some finer scenery, and maybe some variety in set.The PG rated comedy brought humor for all ages. From making the old ladies next to me snort to making the kids behind me kicking my seat laugh, it had a little bit of everything. But the broad audience appeal also stretches its ability to deliver a memorable performance. Watch, you will all forget about it until Blue-Ray (or DVD, no offense) release and then easily pass it up on the shelves.But was this humor for all ages comedy worth the admission?

They did a good job. But it was not what was expected at the outset.In this movie, Larry, Curly and Moe grow up doing their trademark schticks.

They are sacred cows.There is a great risk in taking on a sacred cow. If nothing else, I admire the courage of the Farrelly brothers, goofy guys themselves, who would know the risks all too well. Die-hard Stooge fans might even wish for the failure of the project, if nothing else but to affirm the irreplaceable nature of the Stooges.All that said, I admit I approached the movie skeptically. In the end, I was won over. The movie's homage to the Stooges is in getting them right. All of the slapstick humor is there; all of the wisecracks are there. These Stooges capture the craziness and the randomness of the original Stooges without trying too hard to ""interpret the role"" or any such silliness. It's respectful of the original.For me, once I was comfortable with these guys as the Stooges, the fun was in seeing the Stooges in the present day, where smacking someone over the head with a sledgehammer is even less acceptable than it was in the 1930's. They goof on all sorts of present day annoyances- Jersey Shore, the Kardashians, just like they goofed on high society and other annoyances of their own time.The bottom line: I was laughing the whole time.

And Larry David as Sister Mary-Mengele was very funny.Now for the tough part of the job. The bad stuff. Though there isn't really much to fuss about, my only annoyance was the storyline. Although being in a murder plot added a lot of slapstick and was fun to watch, the wife being greedy trying to kill or ""inherit"" has been done way too many times, especially with comedies. Two examples being The Beverly Hillbillies (1993) and Tommy Boy (1995). It seems to over played. But it did bring the entire story together which was a good thing. It tied up loose ends. The end of the movie was a bit puzzling, but understood, but a bit funny. At the end of the movie is a ""Please don't do this at home"" type of bit. It has the Farrell brothers telling kids that what The Three Stooges do is dangerous and the actual tools used in the movies are fake with sound effects. But the one Farrell brother has his shirt off making his man boobs bounce which made it a bit comical. I really did enjoy the movie and will definitely see it again when it comes out on DVD.

The screen looks bright and vibrant, like a classic THREE STOOGES short with the Stooges' theme song (a jazzy version of ""Three Blind Mice"") playing.

And, to the Farrelly Brothers' credit, they worked hard to make the movie more than a bland homage to classic physical comedy.The opening was the best part by far. The movie presents the early years for the Stooges, so naturally, there are Stooges babies. There's nothing quite like watching a kid do a Moe impression. The child-as-Stooge presence on screen makes the ability to appreciate a joke much easier.The movie would've been so much better if they had kept the child Stooges!Instead, the children go away, and we meet the all new (adult) Three Stooges! This is where that aforementioned effort of the Farrelly Brothers to make the movie different fades considerably. The new Stooges are terrible actors, or at least act that way. To be fair, the movie gives these violent people with child-level IQ's large amounts of dialogue. But, considering the acrobatic technique of the original ""gang of stoogery"", having them stand around and chat with each other is blasphemy! Well, OK, they don't just ""stand around"". It is a 3 Stooges movie, so of course they have to beat each other up. The problem is that the directors think that standing around and beating each other up is the same thing.Moe punches Curly, Larry tells Moe he shouldn't punch Curly. *Punch, punch, eye poke, ear pull, etc.!* This happens for huge chunks of the movie, and the characters awkwardly stand around while talking about their troubles.This brings up a huge problem, the ""story"". The orphanage needs a lot of money, so the Stooges promise to get it. They go to the big city. Sofia Vergara and Craig Bierko try to get them to kill Sofia's husband for the cash. And they just won't stop talking about it! You could say that this is just a kids' movie, which is a fair defense, I suppose. But the jokes they squeeze in between the plot-based banter are just more Stooges punching people in the face, or large objects falling on people. It wasn't funny the second time, or the twelfth.And throughout the movie, the audience is treated to Larry David playing an angry nun. But his character points out the basic problem that undermines the movie. Hearing angry nun dialogue like ""You Stooges always mess everything up!"" is made funnier when said in Larry David's voice. But it's still generic dialogue. Just as the mere presence of Jane Lynch as the head nun doesn't mean anything funny is going on.Like I've mentioned, the Farrelly brothers really did try to make this a different movie from time to time. The highlight, probably, was when Moe gets cast in Jersey Shore. The movie didn't exploit this nearly as well as it could have (Moe punched cast members, mostly), but at least it was an original thought.The Farrelly Brothers also tried to spruce it up with what I have to call the ""Farrelly"" technique. Surprisingly gross comedy! The fight scene with babies as excretory weapons was cringe-worthy, as well as the image of a lion getting hit ""below the belt"". It just didn't fit the good-natured, child-like nature of the Stooges. And it wasn't very funny.This movie, when it was really trying to be exciting, was like any action comedy. Attempted plot resolution leads to attempted violence and running around. I know nostalgia is supposed to be a bad thing, but surely the presence of ""Stooges as heroes"" should stop a movie from looking like BEVERLY HILLS COP or so many other movies like it!As a big Stooges fan, I did like some of the re-creations of the old shorts, and there were a few hard-earned laughs along the way. But this movie was too confident in the ability of the Stooges to make boring crap funny.– Jason LunaThis review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine - www.geekspeakmagazine.com",The Three Stooges
138,gusdesilva,Good faithful continuation of 3 stooges for modern audience,10,9 July 2021,I am not sure why other reviews are so low. This is meant to be the 3 stooges. The original actors have all passed and times have changed so it is very challenging to make a movie based on short films from the 30s. The actors do a great job of playing these roles and the humour is very farrelly brothers which is akin to the stooges. I'm not a big stooges fan but have watched the originals since this movie and I think it is faithful enough. Good job.,The Three Stooges
139,waterbug-73760,It was ok but liked it for other reasons.,5,1 October 2021,"Sorry but this is a self-indulgent review but I felt compelled. I saw this movie with my daughter when she was young. Left the theater thinking the movie was so-so, but my daughter liked it. For some reason the event is a memory for me as one of the last movies I went to with her as a ""kids"" movie. I am writing this more as sharing a few movies in my life have been associated with events rather than the movie itself. I think I have about 5 movies in my life that fall into this category.In 2021 with the movie industry distribution system, ie going to movie theaters, is in a state of flux and going with your kids to a weekend movie at the theater may disappear. I believe when you go somewhere a memory can be firmer over time. So if taking the kids to the movie theater is going to disappear there's some downside to it. However when our family of 4 goes/went when all is said and done it's close to $80. If my kids were still young I know for this reason alone we would go to the the theater, vs streaming, a lot less.",The Three Stooges
140,tdub154420,The Three Stooges just how you remembered them,8,27 May 2012,"If you still watch the old Three Stooges Shorts from way back when and appreciate their humor, there's no reason you won't love this movie. The setting is contemporary, with iphone's and the jersey shore and what not, but this setting is only used to further punctuate the timeless humor of the stooges. All three actors who portray the stooges do a flawless job and make you actually forget that they are not the originals halfway through the movie. It's as if Larry, Curly and Moe have been pulled out of time and placed into today's society getting into the same type of trouble and running the same type of gags they always would. There really isn't a better way the Three Stooges could have been portrayed in this day and age. The Farrelly brothers do an incredible job doing the character of the Stooges justice, weaving a fantastic Stooge-esque plot and transporting these lovable nitwits into the present day. Heck the Farrelly brothers even made sure to include the classic title slides seen before every Stooges short. It's for this reason I give this movie an extremely high rating, not because it's a profound comedy, but because it had one goal: recreate the enduring humor of the Three Stooges, and with that goal in mind this movie overwhelmingly succeeds.",The Three Stooges

So, if you are looking for some mindless laughs and a fun evening at the movies, you will enjoy this one from start to finish. Some of the reviewers here seem to have been looking for something more than this film ever promised. If you are looking for an art house film, or an important and significant film, this one isn't it. If you are looking for a film to be as fresh as the stooges were in their time, this one stays too true to form to fit that bill.

Well, that unfortunately is what it seems the THREE STOOGES movie is like. Not only aren't the new cast of characters as engaging or comical as their predecessors, you can see the gags coming from miles away. One of the main appeals of the original show was that we grew to love the characters even when we knew the gags were coming. We put up with some of the lesser funny ones because we knew more humorous ones were coming. Well, this version wasn't funny. It wasn't engaging. The actors, try as they might, just failed at every level to be remotely entertaining. If the producers thought this was good enough to release, I'd avoid their next effort. I'm sure people will go see this hoping like heck it's similar to the original. Hope as they might, there's no way this will satisfy that desire. Can I get my money back?Avoid this at all costs. Bad idea for a remake.",The Three Stooges
145,originaLee,Pass on this and watch the real shorts instead,1,17 April 2012,"As a lifelong Three Stooges fan, and over 20 year member of the Three Stooges Fan Club, this movie by the Farrelly Brothers was a complete failure. Not once in the over 200 shorts and feature films the real Three Stooges made did they ever mock religion. Yet a major part of this movie, is to, maybe not bash Catholicism, but certainly to insult it. Casting Larry David, someone openly hostile to Catholicism, as a nun named after a Nazi, is tantamount to putting David Duke in black-face to portray Bill Cosby.As for the actors playing the Stooges, they were not very convincing. It seemed like they were doing a Saturday Night Live parody instead of portraying characters. At times each of them nail their respective Stooge voices, and perhaps even mannerisms, but overall they come off like they are in an SNL skit instead of a major motion picture.As for the plot (something of a rip off of ""The Blues Brothers""), it is divided into three acts. Act I, not counting the rampant jabs at Catholicism, seems more like The Little Rascals than the Stooges. In fact, you get the feeling the Farrellys really wanted to do a Three Stooges-Little Rascals team up film. As I said, the film doesn't really bash Catholicism as much as just mock it. Only Larry David's character is truly offensive. The other nuns, while stereotypes, are not really mean spirited (even Kate Upton's bikini moment at the end of the movie, which is totally different than the scene used in the trailers, actually plays as ""cute"" rather than ""malicious""... although her very wooden acting is another matter). There is a scene where the Stooges attack Brian Doyle Murray as a priest that is questionable. Part of the problem of the film is that it tries too hard to inject some heart tugging melodrama into the story, only to fall flat every time.Act II is perhaps the best part of the film, with the Stooges doing some classic bits and routines, but things really start to drag in Act III, as most of it is unbelievably spent promoting the TV show ""Jersey Shore"". The failed attempt at melodrama kicks in again, and there's a happy ending.Overall, I would suggest if you want to see an excellent Stooges movie, pass on this one, and get the DVD of ""Meet The Baron""(1933), perhaps the Stooges' best feature film, starring Jimmy Durante and Ted Healy. It puts this weak remake to shame. Or better yet, get a volume of ""The Three Stooges Collection"", and enjoy their classic Columbia shorts.",The Three Stooges

So, I didn't know what to expect to be honest. will it be good or will it be bad?The Answer? Brilliant!I loved this film so much, I love how the film is all slapstick and heartfelt at the same time.

148,xenolambrose@yahoo.com,A Hearty Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk for All Stooge Fans and Lovers of Slapstick,10,28 April 2012,"First time I've written a review here, but the bottom line IMHO is that if you are a Stooge fan you will NOT be disappointed. The work that went into making you feel you were watching the boys cast into modern times was exceptional, and kudos to the three actors who were cast in the role of our favorite knuckleheads--they embodied the Stooges better than I felt could have been done.A warning though--if you don't like slapstick; Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, and the like, you won't like this movie. (Although interestingly, I attended the show with someone who isn't much into slapstick, who laughed nearly as much as the rest of the audience.And as for purists, Curly is taller than the rest of the Stooges, Moe is thinner than the original, and we don't get to hear Larry do some of his fancy violin work.If you're a parent that thinks that it will be too violent for your children, consider this: if your children understand that the antics seen in cartoons such as Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry, Droopy, and such are just pretend, simply explain to them that this is a cartoon where the ones on the screen are humans, and that everything is pretend and no one really does the slapstick stunts in real life. In fact, the disclaimer at the end says it better than I can--add rubberized objects and sound effects (which really make the stunts come off so well) and they will realize that all is pretend and will love it.I and Stoogedom owe the sound effects people, stunt men and women, the actors, and especially the brothers who put this movie together, a warm debt of gratitude.P.S. Thanks to the aforementioned for not even considering adding a ""Besser"" to the film, but please make another--whatever negative reviews you get are from ones who, well, just don't get it.",The Three Stooges
149,pastormark96707,Good film,6,4 December 2013,"The Three Stooges, I was a little skeptical especially when the announced stars were people like Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro. But they calmed down and instead cast actors like Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and Chris Diamantopoulos who did fine in acting exactly like Larry, Curly, and Moe, respectively, when portraying the legendary comics. And while there's somewhat of a sentimental plot involving some orphan kids, it never goes in treacly territory as there's always some wonderfully staged slapstick scenes that undercuts that. Oh, and there's also some hilarious scenes involving the cast of ""Jersey Shore"". In summary, this version of The Three Stooges is highly recommended for anyone not minding seeing this legendary comedy team played by other actors or anyone who haven't even heard of them yet and wants to see more of them.",The Three Stooges
150,clarkpark24,"Slapstick, Bad Puns and Toilet Humor",10,27 November 2012,"What in the name of all that's holy is the point in trying to recreate the Three Stooges with casted actors?Well, if you start with great writers, cast great actors, all under the direction of the Farrelly Brothers – who clearly both loved and understood the Stooges – you get a great movie.This isn't the Three Stooges as they were. Thanks to the Hayes Commission (no relation to Sean), the original Moe couldn't shove a lobster down Larry's pants to prompt various pained faces and noises followed by a soprano solo.A lot of people writing here will tell you this movie flops because it just isn't funny. Yeah, and Ray Charles had no soul.""Boys, this is Monsignor Ratliffe."" ""Now look here, Senor Rat Lips ."" is funny.Larry David as miserable nun Sister Mary Mengele is hilarious.Dropping a huge cast iron bell on her head from a roof top, followed by Larry looking done at the prone form and exclaiming ""Is that Sister Mary Mengele?"" with Curly responding ""The face rings a bell"" is peed pants funny.Sean Hayes, Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos are as close to Larry Fine, Jack Howard and Moe Howard as Hal Holbrooke was to Mark Twain.This isn't just a tribute or a Stooges remake, it's the Three Stooges sans taboos. Columbia could never have gotten away with a water fight in a maternity ward using new born boys as weapons. The Farrelly Bros did, along with a nun in an R rated bathing suit, a rat down the villainess' cleavage, escaping from a sinking car by igniting Curly's fart and Moe as the new star of Jersey Shore poking Snooki's eyes.If you didn't like the Three Stooges, don't see this movie.

My personal opinion is it is one of the best PG comedy. There is nothing more funny than watching three boneheads mess up and make you laugh. There is not possibly anything negative to say about this picture. It is great for all ages and movie lovers.The great thing about this movie is it is great for DVD. Whether you are feeling sad and want something to cheer you up, or if you want to just feel smarter the Three Stooges will solve your problems. I want to apologize that this review is not more ""complex"" than this but really all this film is about is three goofy people doing dumb things to make you laugh.

The performances are sincere and solid, there is plenty of traditional Stooge action, and they are just as idiotic as ever.If I was to sum this film up, it would be to simply say that it tried something different and admirable, but it didn't quite work. Essentially sticking the Stooges into the modern era with a more modern twist on their classic comedy. It did supply some fresh laughs, but somewhat failed in other areas. The story is a little bit wacky as well, even for the Stooges. It works, and I by no means hated it or anything, but if you find yourself saying out loud ""really?"" in any kind of Stooges episode, you know it may have gone a little too far.All and all, if you're a Stooge fan it is definitely worth watching because you will see a lot of what is familiar and maybe even enjoy a few parts of what is fresh. If you're looking for a good comedy, this is a 50/50 shot. There are laughs, but there is some dead space.I will definitely say it is worth of better than it's 5/10 rating on IMDb. This movie was by no means a failure or a bust, it just didn't quite succeed at what it was trying to do.All and all, a good effort, but I think the concept they were going for almost would have worked better as a TV show.6.5/10",The Three Stooges

My wife and I saw the movie on Friday, expecting it would be somewhat funny, and realizing these actors weren't trying to replace the stooges. I had my reservations, but once the movie started I was really surprised. The actors had the mannerisms (and the voices) down pat. Dern, even the ones playing them as kids were believable. The story seemed in line with what they would do, with the stooges having the same child like innocence they always had. Unlike many movies that show the best clips for the commercials, yet lack any other funny parts for the rest of the film, this movie had MANY laugh out loud scenes, just like the original shorts.

Larry David is a legend, and I think if he's starring in this movie, plus I love the three stooges, and I've seen a lot of three stooges flicks in my day, why not? my mom and I appreciate slapstick so here we are in Edwards Cinemas, and we're watching a few previews first. Madagascar 3, Despicable Me 2, Paranorman, and Ice Age Continental Drift. I can't wait for all of those movies. Then the movie started, and the lights dimmed down. It first starts off at the orphanage, and the three stooges Moe, Larry, and Curly. They proceed to mess things up until the orphanage receives some terrible news. They need to come up with a ton of money, or they have to shut down the orphanage. So, naturally, The 3 stooges save the day, and go out into the big world to get the money. After a long time of laughing, and giggling, I wished I could have seen more. It was just so good and intelligent, and funny, and awesome. If I could give it more than 10 stars, I'd give it a zillion stars. The actors, the director(s), everyone involved should be proud of what they did. Bringing the 3 stooges back in pictures. About damn time. And to those who can't appreciate slapstick, or 3 Stooges, you probably saw the wrong movie. Not your taste? Don't worry. Slapstick ain't for everybody.

OK, they had to do a few things to bring it into 2012 - it isn't like they tried to make a 40-50's version, but with that said they didn't over do it and go crazy with modern references that would throw the 3 stooges off, they made it modern keeping true to the original.You can't beat Larry David playing a nun. The whole cast was really solid. I don't know how the Farrelly brothers do it. When I heard their first line up for the movie I was like ""sounds pretty good"" Then I heard they scrapped it and went another direction. I was bummed, and then heard the new cast and was bummed even more thinking these guys didn't fit as well as the first crew. Well my bad. I cant see anyone else playing the stooges now.

I would recommend renting and watching 5 or 6 Curly-based Stooge shorts before you go, so you can see what a wonderful job the actors did in re-creating the roles with great detail in voice, facial expressions, etc. The Story is Stooge-silly with tons of Stooge references and visual gags. Even the intro music to each segment is note-accurate to the original all beautifully re-recorded. Even the sound effects are either re-created or cleaned up version of the originals. Even the sound editing is an homage to the originals - with slight timing miscues - just like the originals. The Ferrelly Brothers attention to details is fantastic. It's too bad more people don't really get what made the stooges great. Sadly, ticket sales probably will scare away film makers for another 40 years from doing another, but at least I have another great Stooge film in my collection, which b.t.w. is far superior to any of their original feature length films done late in their careers.",The Three Stooges
165,Dragonfire032,Surprisingly Good,9,23 April 2012,"Let me start by saying I grew up watching the Stooges. Granted, it was because my father had grown up watching them and passed it on to me, but I grew up with them regardless. It was because I was such a fan that I decided I'd at least give this movie a chance, regardless of how low my expectations were. I can honestly say that I was very happy that I gave the movie a chance, because despite the trailer's apparent desire to showcase the few poor scenes of the film, it was a very enjoyable movie and a great way to introduce a newer generation to the Stooges. There were gags in the film straight out of the original shorts (i.e. obvious dummies falling then the scene cuts to real people, fast motion shots, etc.).Yeah, the whole Jersey Shore thing was out of place, but mercifully it was only about 5-10 minutes of the movie. There were a few jokes that seemed unstoogelike, but on the whole, I think it was a fine movie. To my surprise, the theater actually started to applaud at the end of the movie. I haven't seen a reaction like that in a long time.I would most definitely recommend this movie to any Stooges fan, or any fan of comedy for that matter. While it may not be perfect, it's a good enough movie to give a shot.",The Three Stooges

I mean they didn't just make some movie that would sell, they really made it feel like it's the real thing. The actors that played them really made it possible. They couldn't have picked a better group of guys to play Larry, Curly, and Moe. It was as if the original men were on the screen. The sound effects were just right and those men never broke out of character. I laughed throughout the entire film and I have never laughed at a movie like that in a really long time. This is also a movie for the entire family to watch. I give it a 10 out of 10, 5 out of 5, two thumbs up and 100% loved it.

The Patriot's Mayo and Brown? Do they need the money or do real actors need the money? At least the Farrelly's will keep their free seats at Gillette. Might as well have used Tom Brady as one of the nuns since he plays like one. Oh, wait a minute, nuns are tougher. The Three Stooges played the boys very well.

They don't get why we the fans find them funny. there more then slap stick. every thing they did was great there dialog was funny. they why they moved were funny there physical look is funny. there look at life as working stiffs. they took political issues of there time and made people laugh at it.The Three stooges brand of humor is timeless they where in they did there original shorts from 1932 to about 1959. then there shorts have run none stop on TV since the late 1950's. that has to be millstone no other comedic act will achieve again. being seen by fans for almost 80 years.after all that in 2012 they decide to do movie with actors playing the parts of Moe, Larry and Curly. the movie would have trouble try to recreate the same lighting twice. but they to get close with this huge letter to originals and fans. it a fun movie that adults and kids will love the story is simply the Boy must safe the orphanage they grew up in from being closed. the movie does this by playing it three shorts with intros much like the old ones. the the three actors are great and hit the hammer on the head no pun intended. you get the boys in all there old haunting ground as handy men, in a hospital, on a golf course and rubbing elbows with the rich.the movie will make you laugh if your a fan of the originals.",The Three Stooges

I actually left after half hour of watching. Slapstick humour has gone beyond its sell by date in this movie. I don't think i giggled or laughed at all.I was surprised to find Sean Hayes playing Larry - a downgrade since his Will & Grace days where he played the lovable Jack and Chris Diamantopoulos playing Moe (Rob Weiss in 24)Obviously i cant write much about the movie, having seen hardly any of it, but all i can and will say is ""ITS AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL""",The Three Stooges

It still bothers me that others made millions from the reruns, and Stooges themselves got little or nothing. I know that the Farrelly Brothers hope to profit from this film, and they deserve it. The reverence that they must have for the Stooges comes through very clearly. From the structure of the film, to the script, and to to performances, everything was perfect. The actors nailed their parts - in voice, mannerisms, and heart. I truly was as if the original Moe, Larry, and Curly were on the screen.All of that aside, the movie was funny. I cannot remember a time when I was in a theater where there was so much laughter coming from the audience. Even my teenage daughter and her two friends laughed out loud. One scene had me laughing so hard that tears came to my eyes.So, if you are a Three Stooges fan, this is a must see movie.P.S. Be sure to sit through the credits.

173,tpkronk,PLEASE DON'T WATCH Unless you are 6 or you used to watch it,1,25 April 2012,"OK I just came back from the movie theater after seeing this film. For all of you people who used to watch it way back when, THIS IS A KID'S MOVIE, understand? If you used to watch them, then you may enjoy it. If you are 6 years old, you may enjoy it, if you love Kate Upton (who is in it) you may enjoy it. Everyone else.. well let's just say that I actually went out of my way to write my first review to warn people about this movie. My father talked fondly of The Three Stooges from when he used to watch it, if they were like this back then, than I feel sorry for whoever watched it. I mean are you kidding me?? Who even made this anyway? Oh wait, we know who, as at the end of movie (before the credits) the directors, (Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly) introduced themselves and explained to the audience how everything that was anything in this movie was faked. That was a mistake; the only way I could possibly see how that helped them is that they are some of the only directors whose faces I know.Why I gave this a one star out of ten:If you love going to a movie, being obviously shown what will happen, and then seeing it actually being done, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. It is without a doubt the most predictable movie I have ever seen. (This is opinion) I assume it was done on purpose (although I'm not sure why) because maybe that's how it was when these guys were big? I'm not sure, I'm 18.The story was awful. THIS IS WHERE SPOILERS ARE: It starts out as Moe, Larry, and Curly are living in an orphanage after being dropped off by some hit in a pretty nice car. They raise hell for 25 years until the orphanage can't pay it's dues, $830,000. So the three go into the big city to find the money. The only problem is, they are morons. Then the story suddenly switches to that of an epic love story of a little girl who is sick, and a seemingly younger boy who will not leave without her. Next it switches back to the crazed reality when Moe goes on ""Jersey Shore"". I'm going to end the description here for I will not give out the ending to any movie no matter how much I despise of it.Why I would possibly give this more than zero out of ten: Sofia VergaraTo summarize, I wouldn't make my worst enemy watch this.~TK",The Three Stooges

But I needed to at least see for myself why the critics were so harsh on this movie.Boy I'm glad I went. This was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time was true entirely to the original stooges. Acting and style of all of it were all top notch. All the old bits were in there and more. But it wasn't all entirely all old hat material. It was like a trip down memory lane and having a blast doing it.This was week two and the theater was actually packed! Not only was it packed but it was full of KIDS! Kids that were giggling and laughing the whole movie. I'm glad the latest generation is going to see this slapstick style of comedy. Even if there was a tiny little ""Do not attempt this at home"" sort of skit at the end.It has been a long time with the poor output of Hollywood lately since I've seen an audience stay and clap at the end. EVERYONE loved it and I enjoyed it. This isn't some serious artsy fartsy thing that will appeal to the caviar eating holier than thou critics.

I didn't enjoy it. The comedy was very crude and terrible, and the scenes that were meant to be funny just made me cringe. I rated this movie as a one, and I hope that you guys don't go see this movie. I usually love going to the movies, but this was the worst twelve dollars that I've ever spent.

176,tom-203-300855,"A confusing, wrong era kind of film",2,28 June 2012,"My experience with The Three Stooges as a property is very typical of my generation – seeing a few scenes in passing as a kid (if that), but largely being familiar with the characters through pop culture references. I knew that there was Moe, the leader, Curly, the childlike giant, and Larry, who had the best quips. We don't talk about Shemp.Even in context, at the time of The Three Stooges being a success, the act was seen as the lowbrow alternative to the already established comedy acts of the time. Laurel and Hardy had a more dynamic relationship; where the audience was given room for empathy. The Marx Brothers' films often had strong love stories at the centre, and put the Marx Brothers in the narrative background: with Groucho doing his almost stream of consciousness one liners, and Chico and Harpo doing intricate physical scenes. And arguably the most beloved and influential comedian in history, Charlie Chaplin who at a society's lowest provided a character (The Tramp) which personified the working class' frustrations of wanting to survive and do the right thing, but constantly getting tripped up.It makes a kind of sense that the Farrelly brothers direct; they have a long history of directing solid physical comedy and giving their comic characters a degree of empathy – something the classic trio need. This movie may even be the most complex iteration of the Stooges as characters, but my main feeling about this movie is confusion – a swirling eddy of confusion.The film is broken into three episodes following Moe (Chris Diamantopolous), Larry (Sean Hayes), and Curly (Will Sasso) as they attempt to raise money to save the orphanage in which they grew up. The first act shows their childhood as they're raised by nuns Mother Superior (Jane Lynch), Sister Mary Mengele (Larry David), and Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson), all of whom do a fine job, although as much as I enjoyed Larry David, mostly for being Larry David, I have to ask, why? The second and third acts follow the adult Stooges as they attempt to raise $830,000, and find themselves involved in a wife's plot to murder her millionaire husband, while Moe becomes a star in a popular reality television show. Both the child Stooges, and the reality television aside outstay their welcome and the latter especially begs another question of why? The story is standard family movie fare, with a surprisingly strong supporting cast (except the reality show stars, who by golly try their darndest to ruin their lines), but the whole thing feels begrudgingly familiar.Alright, so with the guts out of the way, what's this confusion business? Standard family movie fare is how I just put the story, but I can't tell if this really is a family movie. It's bright and colorful, uses plenty of licensed music, and has all the dressings of a family movie but at the same time it features a highly sexualized Sofia Vergara (as the scheming millionaire's wife), an even more highly sexualized Kate Upton (as Sister Bernice, a nun with a single line of dialogue at the beginning which apparently only existed as justification for her to later appear slowly climbing out of a swimming pool, in a swimsuit, you know, just being a nun, doing nun stuff). You can understand that this is someone's idea of 'putting something in for the parents', but by now we have seen how that can be done so much better. It's always been the strength of companies like Pixar that their movies have two strings of jokes running through – the jokes for the parents, and the jokes for the children, but The Three Stooges doesn't seem to have much of a grip on this.The slapstick came off as lazy, with the poking of eyes and hammers to the head, but there was no Rube Goldberg machine of physical humor. On the other hand many of the sight gags and lines were quite good, but I couldn't help but ask myself would a child get them? Would a child understand an 80 minute call back to a chemotherapy joke? Should they? Would a child understand a sight gag of literal farm raised salmon? The nyuk-nyuk-nyuk of eye pokes and hammers were just filler for larger jokes, and always felt like someone remembered they were making a The Three Stooges film so they shoehorned in one more nyuk. After an hour and a half of this brand of slapstick, all I was thinking was how great The Adventures of Lano and Woodley used to be – a series where even the smallest scenes and moments had an incredible craftsmanship and ease to them.It should be said that Diamantopolous, Hayes, and Sasso do a good job; they embody Moe, Larry, and Curly, and look like they're having fun. Sasso especially, captures that unique gentleness of the original Curly that made him the most popular Stooge perfectly, and he also has the most control of his own physicality giving the movie some stand out moments.This was just about the most competent job that could be done to bring The Three Stooges into the 21st century, with spot on impersonations of Moe, Larry, and Curly, despite a clumsy attempt at a classic look and feel. Physical humor has evolved and the slapstick fell flat, while most of the other jokes I can't see working for younger audiences. If audiences are those adults who have nostalgia towards the property, who happen to have their children with them, then maybe the favoring towards call backs and what have you makes sense. Still, there isn't quite enough for either group to leave satisfied, save fans who will just be happy to see their three buddies together again.",The Three Stooges
177,stp919,There is more to love here than hate,10,16 April 2012,"I don't know what the 35% of people who rated this a '1' were expecting. A 4.3 rating? Really? I guess they ""tried to think but nothing' happens""! I and my 13 year-old son were in the 38% who rated it a '10' and I'll tell you why.Us 38%ers got exactly what we were looking for, if not more. This movie is intended to emulate the spirit of The Stooges which, by the way, is timeless. This film was made in that spirit.All of what we enjoy of The Three Stooges is there; the slap-stick physical stuff, the one-liners, the zany antics, the 'out of reality' personalities. Some things straight out of the play-book, others brand new and fresh in the Stooges spirit.The Three Stooges came out of an era where people were hurting and needed an escape, to laugh and feel good. How ironic that this great movie should come out at this time. There were plenty of people laughing out loud in the theater. I had to wipe my eyes off several times from laughing so much. But the best thing I heard was the kids laughing. A lot. A whole new generation exposed to the craziness that is The Three Stooges.My son and I have this thing were we play out scenes and one-liners with each other. This movie gave us a bunch of new material. I can slide 'hey jumbo-tron' right in there with 'hey spinach-chin'.So you 35%ers, you probably shoulda never went. You were expecting something that could never be delivered. Like Curly once said, 'I'm not me'. Us? Can't wait for the DVD. Maybe we'll go see it again.",The Three Stooges
178,YoungDob,I felt ten years old again,7,22 March 2012,"I remember loving Our Gang when I was a kid. Sitting in front of that wood grain TV watching Spanky & Alfalfa, wishing I could be a part of their adventures. Then I remember seeing the Little Rascals (1994) remake, and hating it Despising it. Worst piece of crap ever. Utter. trash. People who obviously had no respect for the original and just...screwed it up.Well, I also remember loving The Three Stooges as a kid. Just classic material. Then I remember seeing the trailer for this new remake, and hating it. I moved on, putting it out of my mind. It got the 2012 treatment and looked like how you would expect it to look when they rape our memories for a quick buck. Then I was invited to a top secret viewing of the flick. Free. I don't pass up free stuff. So I went. Figured I would have fun ranting about this movie later.So , let me get this out of the way first. This movie surpassed my extremely low expectations for it. And that is where I sat with it for a while after I saw it, trying to figure out if I liked it because I had low expectations, or because I truly find it to be actually funny. I have confidently decided on the latter.Yes, The Three Stooges 2012 is a *gasp* funny movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the humor. Yes its essentially a fart joke movie, but.it is a well made fart joke movie, which isn't easy to make. This isn't Norbit. Like the originals, there are well placed jokes,nice set ups and the story mostly moves along at a nice clip. The characters are interesting and plenty of the gags are laugh out loud funny. The film doesn't take itself seriously at all, and is better for it. I felt like the Farrelly brothers have a lot of love for the Stooges, and it really shows up on film. You will fall in love the 10 year old versions of Larry Moe and Curly. I would kill to see an entire movie based on them at the orphanage. IMO 10 year old Curly is channeling Vern from Stand by Me. Like, eerily a pitch perfect Vern.So the film is broken down into 3 episodes in classic Stooges format, but its all one story. You will know where the story is going right away, but it doesn't stop it from being entertaining. There are plenty of twists that make for some laugh out loud jokes that I would hate to ruin for you here. The adult versions of Larry Moe and Curly are REALLY good. I have absolutely no complaints other than Moe's jaw looked too big. That is about it. The mannerisms are flawless, sound effects are on point, even the 'special effects' are done in a way that looks like the originals. The way a bell falls on someone, or the way the boys jump on horses. It is all done in a way that looks fake, but on purpose. The attention to detail in that department made me smile.There is some depth to Moe that we get to see that could have failed miserably as groan inducing but really works here. I was impressed to see some nuanced range. It was just the right touch. What really makes this movie genuinely funny though are all the peripheral characters. Everyone buys in to who they are in this universe and plenty of characters will surprise you. Every single character the Stooges interacted with in even the smallest ways brought something worthwhile to the movie...just like in the originals.*SPOILERS* So the cast of Jersey Shore is in the movie for a short time. The only real issue I had was I thought they played the Jersey Shore gag too much. Using topical humor too much traps a movie in that time period, when The Stooges should always be timeless. With that said, they used the cast well (I hate the show) and even had a hilarious, out of left field Kardashian sisters joke. So the topical stuff was funny, but I feel definitely wasn't needed. *END SPOILERS*The greatest respect I can give this movie is it honestly made me feel 10 years old again. I was laughing like a kid. I let go of all the criticisms I thought I would want to give it and just sat back and ENJOYED IT. Cant remember the last time I did that with this kind of movie. The audience loved it too and clapped at the end. I know right? We must all be idiots, right? Nah. Take your son, nephew or goofy buddy and sit back and enjoy some new Stooge material in 2012. Its not often they get it RIGHT, so you owe it to yourself to see it on the big screen.",The Three Stooges

Do yourself a favor and avoid like the PLAGUE !Since writing this review , I found it necessary to read every other review posted . Firstly , how in the name of God can reviews be so diverse in content , you go from a 10/10 to a forced 1/10 , and some have also entered a minus score ! This just doesn't make sense , or are we being fed reviews from people who could be directly involved with the distribution of this GARBAGE ?For me that's the only way someone could give this trash any score at all , you'd have to be paid to endure what should be considered an insult to comedy and especially the memories of The Three Wonderful Stooges .",The Three Stooges

All three actors are faithful and accurate in their imitation of the beloved characters. (I emphasize ""IMITATION"" because no-one can ever truly replace or replicate the originals.) The actors do a great job bringing the antics of the stooges into the modern day and civilization, while still sticking to the classic roots that made the stooges, ""The Stooges"".

183,joegrow95-345-232129,OK but not worth Theater ticket,5,15 April 2012,"I had high expectations especially with the Farrelly brothers at the helm. They cast three guys who fit the stooges to a tee. The performances by Sasso, Hayes, and Diamantopoulos are superb. They hit the nail on the head mimicking the original stooges.The story is about the Stooges raising money to save an Orphanage, and the trouble they get into trying to reach their goal..There are great shtick scenes that made me laugh, especially the Orphanage Bell scene where Larry David dressed as a nun gets clobbered. You have to see the build up to get the full effect of the gag. The film had some other sequences which were very stooge, such as pratfalls, pokes, slaps and running away from the bad guys. But for some reason the story fell apart with scenes that just didn't fit.  I mean do the Stooges need a cameo by the Jersey Shore cast to be funny?Other scenes missed the mark. When I saw the Stooges in tuxes at an upscale party with food around, I figured here's a recipe for a classic food fight, with a pun just before the person gets whacked in the face with a pie, cake or some other party food. The build up of the party scene shows promise with Larry getting a pant full of lobster. But it falls flat after that when they throw the lobster, shoot a balloon and a little girl falls into a cake.I liked some of this film, but it wasn't worth paying to go see at the theater.

I was very skeptical and worried that Fox would ruin my childhood or the actors who aren't that well known would not properly portray them. But I can gladly say that they didn't mess it up. The movie was pretty decent and they did a great job honoring these legends of comedy. Of course they can't top the original three stooges but they did a fine job trying.,The Three Stooges

The ""Curley Shuffle"" and the ""arm pit hair"" yanks are there; saw across the head with Curley's classic line (you all know it...oh oh oh..look).There are scenes that are absolute knee slappers (there were four middle-aged women behind me who couldn't stop laughing) but, to be fair, the movie does drag at times. It starts a little slow and there are times where it just seems like there's too much plot and not enough Stooge antics.But when the guys are doing their thing, like at the hospital, or when Moe is on TV with the cast of Jersey Shore, or the guys are on stage, or when the guys think the Nuns are being molested, I promise, you won't be disappointed.On the other hand, if you don't like slapstick comedy, or are looking for some serious drama, DON'T see this movie; you won't enjoy it.

187,tastytreats69,I really wanted this to be funny....,1,20 April 2012,"I went into this with apparently much to high of hopes, it's a bit hard to find a decent comedy lately.I'm going to keep this short & sweet, I laughed twice, even small children in the audience weren't laughing. If you saw the previews you've probably already laughed as much as you would seeing the entire movie, it's beyond obvious it's 3 B-class actors TRYING to be the Stooges. There's just not accurate words to describe how truly unfunny this wretched pile of garbage is....except for the two stupid-hot nuns :)I need to meet the minimum requirement for the review.It needs ten lines.Am I there yet?",The Three Stooges
188,jrsanfilippo-357-521411,Loved this movie ... very funny in parts ...,9,29 April 2012,"This was a very well done movie. Some of it was predictable, but I still had to laugh. The actors were all spot on ... they did an incredible job. The stand-out surprise for me was the young stooges. Those kid actors were awesome. I would have loved to have more of them! I am looking forward to more of these movies(shorts) with the same actors. Like I said before, I hope that they actually made more with the young stooges, I am telling you those would go over big! I took my 14 year old daughter and she told me afterwards ... I thought it was going to ""unfunny"", but is was really funny. It is a fun movie and you will not be disappointed.",The Three Stooges
189,mariomasterman1,When will Hollywood learn that remakes suck?,1,30 April 2012,"My God... This is truly one of the worst- no, THE worst movie I have ever seen. How did they mess up the three stooges this bad? UGhhhh... OK, I admit I actually wanted to see this movie, and not because I thought it would be good, no no no no I'm not that stupid. I actually like to watch bad or weird movies just to see how bad or weird they can get. Being a person who exclusively watches classic movies and television, when I saw they were making this I could only hang my head in shame. I knew the three stooges would be ruined forever for the next generation but I can't believe they DESTROYED it. So I went to the movie theater with my Dad (Who is a big three stooges fan, the poor guy.) and my Brother. I sarcastically asked the ticket lady for three tickets for the ""disgrace to cinema""...She knew what I meant. So we sat down in the movie theater bracing for impact while watching the 20 minute advertisements we just paid $22.50 for. So the movie is divided into three episodes which have the classic three stooges opening with the new actor's faces which I have to admit is pretty cool that they did that... Enjoyment stops there. This movie has lame over done jokes, poorly delivered clearly set up puns, extremely violent ""slapstick comedy"" sometimes with chainsaws and knives to the head, a ton of animal cruelty, bathroom humor like fart jokes, genital jokes, and babies peeing into people's faces, mean-spirited jokes, cringe inducing child actors including the three stooges as kids, an abundance of clichés, random out of nowhere drama, and over the top hyperactive stooges that are so crazy they become totally different from the originals....Oh and Jersey Shore.... Thanks Hollywood.... The director of this movie apparently wanted to make a comedy but he couldn't decide between a slapstick comedy or a regular comedy with a little drama so he decided on both and threw in the three stooges so the movie would attract more viewers. Can't wait for Prometheus. That might help me restore hope in modern movies after watching this insult.",The Three Stooges
190,tagivens1990,Worst movie possible to remember the life's of The Longest Comedy Act in history,1,2 May 2012,"This movie was absolutely terrible, after getting ten minutes into the film I had to hold myself back from walking to the ticket booth and getting my money back. The directors of this film disgraced Moe Larry and Curlys memories by making them out to be Special Needs. As a kid growing up watching a lot of their shorts, specials and movies and seeing how they really were in the films that THEY THEMSELVES were in to seeing this is mindbogglingly insulting to their names. In 2000, Mel Gibson directed a movie based on their career as a comedy act and all the challenges and hardships that they faced, I saw this movie for the first time in 2011, being 21 years old watching a movie based on their career I thought it was an excellent movie and really showed their relationship with each other and the people that they were on and off the set and how they made it from small time comedy clubs to being under contract with Columbia Pictures where their career really took off. Gibsons film was not only educational and just as funny as their shorts with Columbia Pictures, but also very heartfelt and depressing when showing the end of the original Curly Joes comedy career and his passing followed by Shemps passing but along with their reunion performance at the end of the film and summary of the Longest Comedy Act in history coming to an end. Moe, Larry and Curly; along with Shemp even though he wasn't in the movie, WERE NOT special needs nor idiotic freaks that were a menace to society, yet a group of people with the gift of laughter to bring people joy by their amazing ability and gift to make people laugh, and this movie that has just been filmed and released to theaters deserves to be taken from all theaters around the world collected together and either locked away for eternity or destroyed leaving no evidence of its existence and all digital copies deleted/destroyed/terminated so that years and years from now in the future the world may begin to forget about this horrible film.",The Three Stooges
191,thomas-green555,"Good movie, good actors and many critics",8,29 July 2012,"I don't know why so many people hated this movie. It is a good copy of that genial comedy series. Everybody who saw the old The Three Stooges knows that. The actors did a really good job, trying to be the most similar possible. Of course the story is not brilliant but it were enough to make me, at least, laugh a lot, like when Moe was on that TV Show. I think the sense of humor of nowadays is completely wrong. People think that if there is no sexual content or 'bad language' the movie is bad. The three Stooges, the old or new, is the pure essence of humor. If they started to make a new series of them with these actors would be great.",The Three Stooges
192,sally-newby11,"Easy Watching, Sunday afternoon Film",8,9 July 2012,"I thought this film was fantastic, in that it met the expectations as an easy comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, as mentioned, it's a Sunday afternoon, just finished your dinner chill out and unwind film. The actors are fantastic in that half way through, I had to google other films they have been in.I like the fact that the film isn't trying too hard to be a drama/comedy, the storyline is typical yet interesting. The ending is obvious, but it's a comedy, not a thriller so I don't think that matters. Just to add - Slapstick humour is not to everyones taste, so those people who don't enjoy it, shouldn't really watch a film and then rate it poorly.",The Three Stooges
193,rogersdonna,Brilliant casting for Three Stooges.,8,9 July 2012,"Brilliant re-enactment of original Stooges, all had superb mannerisms, quirks, voices and ""slapstick"" manouvres down pat. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and as an officiando of the beloved original Stooges, a very highly commendable effort - great casting, Moe, Larry, and especially Curly with his nyuks-nyuks, backward steps, and head slapping....brilliant. It would not have been easy to cast but a brilliant job. Well done to film-makers and great casting. I also liked the updating of Stooges, with IPhones, Facebook and tweet references, and reality shows bringing the Stooges into the modern day era. Good supporting cast.",The Three Stooges
194,clarakrocks,No.,2,14 August 2012,"This movie was a waste of my time. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. Throughout the entire movie, they're beating a dead horse. A really, really dead horse. It got old thirty seconds in.The need to include Jersey Shore and television producers as a solution to their problems, along with a man and a slutty girl in a bathing suit as nuns is beyond me. Bursting with crude humor in all the wrong forms, this is just plain wrong. The story line is boring, and the point is lost. On occasion, bits of humor are nearly worth your breath to laugh at, and at times the dialog makes you almost feel bad for the protagonist, yet all in all painful. Too vague to be interesting. It makes to old Stooges seem almost bearable. Not worth watching, ever.",The Three Stooges
195,abzi_xx,Brilliant,10,7 March 2013,"I found this film a lot funnier than I thought I would. To begin with I had reservations as it seemed that the obvious humour was out of place in a modern setting but that was soon forgotten. My boyfriend and I were in stitches throughout the entire film. More than exceeded my expectations. Now I have never watched the original so I have no memories to compare the remake to but I will say it was very funny and could be quite sweet...most of the time lol. Don't get me wrong it had its slightly raunchy moments. I was really impressed with the actors who played the stooges' characters, they were brilliant. I have found that in most films the trailers show all the humour and when you finally get to watch it there's nothing left, with this film however that is not the case. It is absolutely nonstop laughs! I would absolutely recommend giving this a chance, i'm sure you will not regret it. 10/10!",The Three Stooges
196,pwns,True to Stooge,10,30 June 2013,"This movie was perfectly cast to replace the originals. The writing and classic shtick was perfect. I grew up with the original 3 stooges I found the casting was perfect. IF you compare the old actor to the new cast they are almost dead ringers no pun intended. The sound effects and special effects were great, however the disclaimer video at the end was a downer. It is much for find for kids to get it from their mom and dad while they are on the way to hospital after they try all the stunt themselves. All in all a great movie and if you can either rent it or buy it on DVD or blue Ray it will be a great addition to your collection",The Three Stooges
197,andrew-mulligan-am,Blues Brothers. Ring any bells?,1,5 May 2013,"This movie is a good laugh for little kids due to the violent and mindless conduct and a very mature message at the end of the movie about safety, which was very professional, that has got to be admired. Now the good points are over here are the disadvantages. It is a terrible disappointment to all three stooges fans as it did not meet any expectations and I can not think why it is rated high by users. I wouldn't mind if they had just stopped there, it would be a 6 from me, but they went and copied of a classic movie whilst they were at it( like most modern day movies). If you have seen the Blues Brothers, an all time 80's classic, you will understand by now, but if you have not, allow me to fill you in. The blues Brothers was about two foul-mouthed orphans come criminals/ musicians, who visit there old orphanage. They soon find out, by the very unimpressed nun, that the orphanage is closing down if it does not get money to stay open, so the two men go of to regroup the band for a last gig to raise money for the orphanage whilst being on the run from many people. Now in the three stooges, they have to get money to save the orphanage and they finally, miraculously get the money to save the orphanage and the unimpressed nun. See the Blues Brothers, which is a frankly much much better film and you will see how much theses films are alike in their plot, but not in how good they both are, The Blues Brothers gets a 10 of me, see it and you will see what I mean.!",The Three Stooges
198,kaysersuzee,I love this movie!,9,6 April 2013,"I admit that I thought this might be a cheap comedy, much like McHale's Navy and other movies which capitalize on TV shows of earlier eras. But once I saw that The Farrely Brothers were responsible for this, my expectations were raised. I would not recommend this to anyone who is not a fan of the original stooges. To them, it would seem idiotic. But if you grew up on the originals, this movie pays homage to them in a very beautiful way. The characterizations of Moe, Larry and Curly are spot-on, with NEW physical comedy bits, not just showing the old bits over again. New comedy bits in the style of the stooges, with crazy bits where their slapping and poking gets raised to new heights that would have been very difficult (which the originals must have been) without modern film-editing tools. I was laughing hysterically at many parts - such as where the stooges fall of the roof, with the cut-in-half ladder, on Sister Mary-Mengle (Larry David - the character by itself is comic genius). Moe has a lovable quality, seeing him as Moe the kid (very funny) creates a sympathetic character never approached in the originals). Larry is so lovable as a child - the casting in this movie is just wonderful - and so incredibly dumb and unaware as an adult, that you have to love him. And Curly - Will Sasso really almost steals the show with his INCREDIBLY accurate and hysterical impression of Curly! How did he do this? I couldn't take my eyes off of him - one reason I had to watch this movie a number of times and purposely watch what the other actors (Moe and Larry) were doing, because Curly is so magnetic here. I can understand that the movie was held up because of casting issues - they had to get this perfect or it would have flopped. Curly is perfect! I read that they were considering many actors for the roles, but Will Sasso nailed this perfectly! I watched this movie, not twice, not three times, but almost continually for two solid days - I will eventually buy a copy because of how priceless this movie is. Moe, Larry and Curly live again! What a tremendous tribute to their hard work and to their unrewarded later years. How unfortunate that the movie industry took advantage of them so badly - I hope that their heirs are rewarded with a pct of the gross of this movie - I think they should be!",The Three Stooges
199,scottlucia,Expected a whole lot more,7,23 April 2012,"I'm now 40 and I grew up loving the stooges, I still DVR them today! I've waited a long time for this movie but I left disappointed. The poking and slapping were done very well. The guys did a good job acting like the stooges, Moe was probably the best and Larry was my least favorite. Actually I felt that the stars from the 2000 AMC movie were slightly better. I didn't find myself laughing like I hoped I would. There were a couple of funny parts, (but way more in other Farrely movies). I'm sure it was a tough movie to write though. I didn't really buy the whole orphanage story line. I also didn't like the Jersey Shore portion. I don't watch the show so it kinda didn't make sense to me. I wish they would have made it more like the AMC Movie, Explain their lives and how they got to be stooges and then maybe make a sequel with more action and comedy. Maybe someone else will do it. I wish I would have waited for it to be on Netflix.",The Three Stooges
200,mhoffman8540,It was okay.,5,20 July 2012,"Having been a life-long fan of the Stooges, I looked upon this movie with the anticipation of having Sir Laurence Olivier work on my teeth. I got it today watching it from the ""On Demand"" service from my cable company, and was pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the laughs of a good Stooges short, but, it wasn't totally terrible. Some of the bad guys in this movie did remind me of the supporting cast of the Stooges; such as Sofia Vergara was like a Latina Christine McIntyre, and Stephen Collins was like Kenneth McDonald. The main problem was that there was no real chemistry between the three actors playing the Stooges. Especially since the original Stooges were 2 brothers and Larry (either combination of Moe & Shemp, or Moe & Curly). If you are HUGE Stooges fans, go in with the prospect of HATING this movie, and you'll get some smiles, but no serious laughs.",The Three Stooges
201,mdmd-986-2448,Loved it,7,28 April 2014,I was entertained. I don't critic a movie from a snobby self righteous point of view. I laughed a lot and thought the actors did a great job. Sofia V. was great too. She is a talent. I thought the gents playing the stooges were great too. EspeciallyLarry as the voice was dead on. They all were goo. including the nuns and priests and villains. I would love to see a sequel. Again I am easily entertained and like most movies unless they are political opinions and propaganda films trying to push an agenda which now a good 10% of movies are today. I have seen this several times and it still makes me laugh. I have the connection as a kid to the stooges.,The Three Stooges
202,thunderhats,well......it was funny?????,6,1 July 2014,"I'd like to start with that I never REALLY liked slapstick comedy, but that if you overdo it, or under do it, it works (strangely stupid, really). This movie is the example of the former, it does it so obnoxiously that I can't help but snicker or grin every few jokes, I even burst out laughing twice, one when the bell fell on the nun, and when I saw Moe on the jersey shore (makes me chuckle even thinking about it). so you might be wondering why it doesn't have a 7,8 or 9, and to that I say: it sucked. that's not enough? okay, let's start with the acting, the nun that is a man (or maybe I'm wrong) would have been more fun if he/she hadn't been so emotionless, same goes with the stooges, the face acting was great, but I got so tired of the voices straight away, but my biggest problem was....drum roll ...the ending, not because, everything like the girl turning out to be perfect, the guy reuniting with his bro, and them getting the money while having Ted around was solved (that helped too), it was that the STOOGES Didn't LEARN ANYTHING! things changed, but not their selves, their stupid understandings, their trouble making crap, OR ANYTHING!!!! but other than that and a few plot holes, I liked it, just for it's fun moments, good job",The Three Stooges

Though the impersonations were good by these ""stooges"" the storyline was rubbish. This attempt at slapstick was an insult to the memory of the wonderful stooges. I don't understand why Hollywood finds it necessary to ""remake"" a classic, The Sgt Bilko movie, brings to mind another disaster. The Three Stooges biographical movie in 2000, was outstanding and showed what wonderfully talented and wonderful human beings, that unlike a number of comedy duos and trios, genuinely loved each other off stage and off screen. The reunion concert, after Curly's death is a tear jerker. Please Hollywood leave the immortals alone & no remakes or attempts at impersonations.",The Three Stooges
