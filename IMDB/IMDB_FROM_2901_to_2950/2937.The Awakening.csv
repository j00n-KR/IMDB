0,SnoopyStyle,Good atmosphere,7,23 September 2013,"It's 1921 after the horrors of WWI, England is full of charlatans trying to scam grieving people. Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) is a professional skeptic driven to exposing hoaxes and getting the cons arrested. Robert Mallory (Dominic West) invites her to investigate a ghost at a boarding school. There was a murder long ago that could be the source, and recently a student had died. Florence is met by governess Maud Hill (Imelda Staunton) and the boy Thomas Hill. Teachers and staff soon goes on vacation leaving Florence alone with Robert, Maud and Tom in the school.This setting has a good old fashion atmosphere. It's basically a big old isolated building with a handful of people and a ghost story. You can't really get any more classic than that. The story does have a convoluted twist that could be quite problematic. I was able to follow the twist, and I'm fine with it. Rebecca Hall is a nice capable actress. And she makes a good avenging heroine and a damsel in distress.",The Awakening
1,claudio_carvalho,A Time for Ghosts,8,25 May 2012,"In 1921, in London, the arrogant and skeptical Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) is a famous for exposing hoax, helping the police to arrest con artists. The stranger Robert Mallory (Dominic West) tells her that the headmaster of the boarding school in Rookford had invited her to travel to Cumbrio to investigate a ghost that is frightening to death the pupils. He also tells that many years ago there was a murder in the real estate and recently the pupil Walter Portman had died. The reluctant Florence finally accepts to go to Cumbrio.On the arrival, she is welcomed by the governess Maud (Imelda Staunton) and the boy Thomas Hill. Sooner Florence discovers what had happened to Walter and then the students, teachers and staff are released on vacation, and Florence remains alone with Robert, Maud and Tom in the school. Florence is ready to leave the boarding school and strange things happen. Florence comments with Robert and he tells that there is only three persons in the boarding school, leaving Florence scared.""The Awakening"" is a ghost story that begins with the information that between 1914 and 1919, the war and the influenza claimed more than one million lives in Britain. The storyline is very similar to the 1995 ""Haunted"", with a woman that exposes hoax and swindlers traveling to her home town to investigate a ghost that is haunting the students of a boarding school. Nevertheless the supernatural story is engaging and has many plot points with new revelations. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Despertar"" (""The Awakening"")",The Awakening
2,nogodnomasters,HORROR/THRILLER SLEEPER,9,6 December 2018,"Rebecca Hall stars as Florence Cathcart an educated woman who debunks spiritualists. The movie opens with a seance in 1921 London. Our heroine springs into action.She is then requested to come to an orphanage where a ghost of a boy has been spotted and photographed. She dismisses the ghostly images, and accepts the task.
Florence is an independent and educated woman, who smokes. She reminded me of Anne Hathaway in this role. As her investigation proceeds, Florence begins to doubt her skepticism/atheism.Interesting film with a twist that has clues. Good use of sound. Enjoyable.PARENTAL GUIDE: Sex and nudity (male and female)",The Awakening
3,kosmasp,"Finally, Rebecca Hall has come back ...",6,9 May 2013,"... to our screens? Well she hasn't been away too long. Actually right at this moment she can be seen in Iron Man 3. But she hasn't done that many horror movies now has she? Dorian Gray of course, but she seems to be cast in comedies mostly. But her range is phenomenal. Look at her performances and she never seizes to amaze. In Lay the Favorite with Bruce Willis she seems like a complete different person. Especially to the one that can be seen in this movie.The story might not be everyones taste, but you can decide that for yourself. I thought it was nicely handled and I was about to give the movie a 7/10, but the ending did not completely satisfy me. I think I was hoping it'd go the other way. Nevertheless this is a decent horror movie with quite a few scares thrown into the mix",The Awakening
4,gavin6942,Looks Great,6,14 October 2014,"In 1921, England is overwhelmed by the loss and grief of World War I. Hoax exposer Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) visits a boarding school to explain sightings of a child ghost. Everything she believes unravels as the 'missing' begin to show themselves.We have great-looking cinematography with its colorization, giving the illusion of it taking place long ago (why this effect works is a mystery). But maybe that is all we have.Roger Ebert rated it 1.5/4 stars and wrote that the film ""looks great but never develops a plot with enough clarity to engage us, and the solution to the mystery is I am afraid disappointingly standard."" Yep, that is all. While this looks better than the average film (definitely the average horror film), it is not nearly as engaging as it could be, and just never hits home.",The Awakening
5,jboothmillard,The Awakening,3,30 September 2013,"I saw the DVD cover for this film plenty of time in the DVD rental and retail stores, I knew it was a scary movie, and I found out afterwards one of the makers of TV show Ghostwatch was involved, but that didn't make any difference to me having watched it. Basically it is 1921, in London, Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) being arrogant and skeptical has a reputation for exposing hoaxes and con artists and helping the police arrest those involved, and her latest assignment is at a boarding school in Cumbria where apparently a ghost is haunting and frightening the pupils to death. School teacher Robert Mallory (Dominic West) tells her that years ago there was a murder on the estate, and pupil Walter Portman died recently, she eventually accepts to go, she is welcome on arrival governess Maud Hill (Imelda Staunton) and lonely child Thomas 'Tom' Hill (Isaac Hempstead Wright). The school is empty of all the pupils and teachers apart from Florence, Robert, Maud and Tom, and while the investigation into what happened in the boarding school that made everyone leave, and when the remaining characters plan to leave themselves that is when strange things start happening. Also starring Joseph Mawle as Edward Judd, John Shrapnel as Reverend Hugh Purslow, Cal Macaninch as Freddie Strickland, Lucy Cohu as Constance Strickland, Shaun Dooley as Malcolm McNair, Diana Kent as Harriet Cathcart and Richard Durden as Alexander Cathcart. The cast were okay, Hall being feisty, Cooper being serious and Staunton being creepy, it is the story and what was going on that was the problem for me, the bits that were meant to be scary did not work, I didn't feel tension or nerves while watching, and I agree the conclusion is silly, well, actually the whole film is silly, a disappointing period supernatural thriller. Adequate, in my opinion!",The Awakening

7,hitchcockthelegend,There's no place on earth people understand loneliness better than here.,7,12 October 2015,"The Awakening is directed by Nick Murphy and Murphy co-writes the screenplay with Stephen Volk. It stars Rebecca Hall, Dominic West, Imelda Staunton, Isaac Hempstead Wright, Shaun Dooley and Joseph Mawle. Music is by Daniel Pemberton and cinematography by Eduard Grau.Britain, post World War 1, and Florence Cathcart (Hall) makes a living as an exposer of charlatan spiritualists, a debunker of ghost sightings. When she receives a request from school master Robert Mallory (West) to investigate the supernatural events at a remote boarding school for boys, she is suitably intrigued to take on the assignment...It comes as no surprise to find that numerous reviews for The Awakening make reference to ghost story films that were made previously. The Woman in Black released a year later would suffer the same fate, charges of it not bringing nothing new to the table etc. A ghost story set in a big mansion or remote educational/correctional establishment is what it is, and will continue to be so, all fans of such spooky fare ask is that it does it well and maybe add some adult themes into the bargain. The Awakening does these in spades.The concept of a disbeliever in ghosts having their belief system tested to the full is not new, but it's a great concept and one with longevity assured. Here, boosted by a terrific performance from Hall, the screenplay consistently keeps you guessing. The possibilities of real or faked are constant as the director pumps up the creep factor, whilst he simultaneously crafts a number of genuine shock sequences - including one of the best doll house scenes put to film! This really has all the requisite jolts and atmospheric creeps for a period spooker.It's not until the final quarter when the screenplay begins to unravel its mystery, a finale that has proved both ambiguous and divisive. The ambiguity factor is a little baffling since everything is made clear in a nicely staged scene, and this is something which the director has gone on record to state as well. As for the divisive side of things? That's a blight for this sub-genre of horror. It's convoluted! Contrived! It has been done before they cry! These are true to be sure, and without doubt there's a leap of faith required to not get annoyed, but it garners a reaction and has done its ghost story essence very well indeed.Beautifully photographed, scored and performed by the leads to boot, this is for sure one for fans of period spookers with brains. 7.5/10",The Awakening
8,LeonLouisRicci,Extremely Muddled Ending...But Getting There is Worth a Watch,7,28 March 2017,"Atmospherically Glum and Goosebumby with its well Mounted Cinematography and Stunning, Captivating, Realistic, Scientific Devices makes this Muddled Movie Forever Watchable.The Good Acting from the whole Cast Lead by Rebecca Hall and Dominic West also can Attract Attention.But after the Story Unfolds and Certain Things are Revealed, the Film just Collapses under the Weight of Ambiguity, Confusion, and a Desire to Wallow in its Own Cleverness. It is one of the most Mysterious Missteps in Recent Movies about Ghosts, Haunting, and the Paranormal.It leaves the Viewer Deflated of the Awesome Spectacle and Spectres Previously on Display. A Display that Captured and set a Convincing, Terrifying Tone.

9,CinemaSerf,"Not exactly scary, but still quite effective...",6,25 November 2020,"This is quite an intriguing film - more of a thriller than a horror, with a good cast and some good writing. The no-nonsense Rebecca Hall (""Florence"") is a sort of exorcist-type of woman - well versed in exposing not so much real spectres as fakes and hoaxers, who heads to a boarding school where there have been reports of some ghostly goings on. When she arrives, suitably sceptical - she discovers that the place does have some murderous history to it and matron ""Maud"" (Imelda Staunton) stays with her to get to the bottom of the mystery with ""Robert"" (Dominic West) and the young pupil ""Tom Hill"" (Isaac Wright) whilst the other children are on holiday. The characterisations are a little on the shallow side, and it's not exactly a fast moving affair, but the acting is efficient and there are just enough creepy scenes to keep it interesting, with a magnificent stately home setting.",The Awakening
10,Boba_Fett1138,Great atmospheric genre movie.,7,30 June 2012,"This little movie came a bit as a surprise. I don't think anyone expected anything good from it but as it turned out, this is simply being one fine and very atmospheric genre movie.This is not necessarily a typical horror/ghost movie but more one that relies on its mystery, rather than on its scares. And it handles its mystery quite effective and compellingly. It tells its story well and keeps things interesting at all times, making this basically a good watch from start till finish. Granted that you can see the big 'twist' coming from miles away already (well, at least if you are somewhat familiar with these type of movies already) but for some reason this didn't bothered me all that much and didn't prevented me from really liking this movie. The mystery of the movie also heavily relies on its atmosphere, which is simply a great and very suiting one. It has some nice cinematography and also the right required settings.Another aspect I also really liked about the movie was its main character, played by Rebecca Hall. It was a strong female lead, which isn't all that common for a movie of this sort, especially not one that is set in the very early 20th century. It worked out well and helped to keep things fresh and original, while in essence this is of course still being a very formulaic genre flick. Yes, if you have seen plenty of movies involving a ghost story already, this movie really isn't anything that new or surprising to watch but it at least, unlike some other genre examples, never really has a dull moment in it and keeps things going and interesting at all times, even when there is not an awful lot happening. I think that this is actually the foremost reason why I ended up liking this movie so much, despite all of its still present and obvious (story) flaws and weaknesses.Simply a good genre movie, that is well worth checking out.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.nl/",The Awakening
11,view_and_review,Artsy Pretentious Ghost Film,3,24 December 2015,"1920's England, Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) is a ghost hunter that doesn't believe in ghosts so she goes around exposing fraudulent ghost stories. She met her match when she visited a boys school that had a specter problem.This pretentious film was so full of it. It was rife with ambiguous dialog about the past, about feelings and other things. There was love, there was loss, there was longing, there was lust and a lot of other useless gibberish. In its effort to be deep and complex it fell flat. The acting was so over the top as was the script. The story, though not entirely predictable, was lame and took a page right out of ""The 6th Sense"" and ""The Others"" book.What were they going for? If they were going for the foreign, artsy, abstruse feel, then they got it--but that's not an automatic recipe for success. And what really sucks is that the movie started off so well. I thought it had a real chance to be something good but it completely fizzled out.",The Awakening
12,FlashCallahan,Who Ya Gonna call?....,6,8 April 2012,"Be warned: If you Have seen The Woman In Black, it may affect the way you see this film. So if you get the chance, see this before...The plot of the film Surrounds a woman who reveals confidence tricksters (which when we meet her, we have the best set piece of the whole movie), gets called to a school as the children may be playing a hoax.We Meet Dominc west, who has a slight stutter and picks his legs, and also Imelda Staunton, who still thinks shes in Vera Drake.There she hears a story of a boy who died, but a lot of th children still see him walk the corridors Cue the shocks....As well as the Woman in Black, this film owes a lot to The others as well. The children in the film are very unnerving and the inclusion of photographs is reminiscent of the 2001 chiller.The performances are okay, West and Hall stand out in this, but it has a sense of Deja vu to it.The best scare is in the trailer, and the reason i advise people to see this before TWIB, is because not many people have heard of this, and it would be unfair to class this as a rip-off to that movie.The Orphanage maybe.....",The Awakening
13,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Awakening,6,13 April 2012,"Haunted mansions and a ghostly kid. Sounds like formula all over again. But to its credit The Awakening packed a reasonable storyline to prop up a mystery and provided some attempts at scaring the audience, except that its focus centered around the main lead Florence Cathcart (Hall) and her capabilities making this more like a ghost hunter's adventures in early 20th century England, with creepy sets to boot.And Florence Cathcart is undoubtedly an interesting character, who through the course of the film transforms from a Dana Scully equivalent to a Fox Mulder believer. We get introduced to her in the tail end of her investigations to bust false prophets and mediums who claim to be able to communicate with the nether world, and she does so with aplomb and satisfaction, exposing those in the trade to fool gullible citizens who are unable to let go of their grief. A bestselling author, she gets challenged one day by a teacher of a boarding school, Robert Mallory (Dominic West) to look into a recent death of a pupil, who had claimed to have seen a ghost before he died.Reluctant at first, she takes up the challenge, brings her wares, and digs deep to try and prove that a boarding school is fertile ground for pranks to be played by its many naughty students, a thought that soon got debunked as little by little the inexplicable happens, paving way for great atmospherics set up by the filmmaking team, utilizing the sprawling mansion with its dimly lit long corridors and staircases to full effect. But the scares never really got there, with the usual shadow play and bag of tricks used, with director Nick Murphy being quite certain to want to play up the atmosphere to raise those goosebumps, yet underwhelm in his delivery of real moments that will make your heart beat faster, nor allow you any avenue to squirm in your seat.The narrative then has enters into the school vacation period, which reduced the number of usual suspects who could have some role to play in the whole scheme of things, such as Mallory himself being a war veteran and have lived through hell on earth during WWI, the matron Maud Hill (Imelda Staunton whose make up makes her look really sinister), and the young kid Tom (Isaac Hempstead Wright) who stays behind because his parents were away. It doesn't take long for you to soon figure out who's who and what's what, although I am fairly impressed with the backstory Nick Murphy and Stephen Volk had come up with, while on one hand isn't something not done before, but still it's well written and fleshed out, dealing with how we tend to psychologically block out really nasty memories from our lives in what would be an automatic self-protecting mechanism.Rebecca Hall plays it really serious as an investigator hell bent on using (rudimentary) science to bust all matters of the supernatural, only to find herself caught thick in some ghoulish action. She's no scream queen here as her character possesses more of a pragmatic and determined mind to learn of the truth, only for tables to be turned and for her to dig deep into her own experiences instead in order to live through the ordeal. Probably the only disbelief here in the entire movie would be her character's needless romance with Dominic West's Mallory, which was quite unnecessary if only to show that some desperate feelings develop in a cold, dark mansion with two lonely people being put together.The final scenes of the film offered up some nice little twists and surprises that prolonged the conclusion, with an epilogue that will leave you guessing right up until the last minute to see whether Nick Murphy decided to go for the jugular like other films in the genre, or to stick to a more traditional and conventional finale, and I'm glad it was what it had decided to be. It may not effectively be an out and out horror film designed to scare, but as a mystery-thriller, it does have what it takes and presented something quite decent through its storytelling strength.",The Awakening
14,HumanoidOfFlesh,Interesting but a little bit conventional ghost story.,7,21 June 2012,"Skeptic Florence Cathcart(Rebecca Hall)believes it's a time for debunking ghosts.She is an author of famous book ""Seeing Through Ghosts"".She doesn't believe in God or any spirituality.So our ghost buster is sent to investigate their provincial boys boarding school where one of the students has died after reports of seeing the twisted spectre of young boy.The strange spectral phenomena overwhelms her as she starts digging in the past...""The Awakening"" is a pretty creepy if not conventional ghost story influenced by ""The Others"" and ""The Orphanage"".The action moves slowly and there are some genuinely effective jump scares.The cinematography of Edward Grau is lush and the sound effects are great.Unfortunately the film becomes too sentimental in its second half.7 spectres out of 10.",The Awakening
15,Robert_duder,"A solid, creepy ghost story that pushes the boundaries of sensibilities",7,25 January 2013,"I went into The Awakening with no prior knowledge of what the film was about except that it was meant to be creepy and had something to do with ghosts. This is the type of film you'll want to go into mostly blind because knowing too much is a bad thing. The film is very well crafted, it knows its genre and it sits comfortably in it. Much of the film feels like its been done before. It could be easily compared to The Others, Woman In Black, or even Sixth Sense and while the film has a twist ending it doesn't really come as a surprise because as many people point out there are very few new ideas in the ghost story genre. However, that doesn't make this film any less smart or entertaining. It is well written and a good story and genuinely gave me chills in several scenes. They use the eerie country setting of the empty boys' school to their benefit and it really gets under your skin. The characters are well developed and the film really has a smart ending that insists you watch carefully to follow each twist and turn. Its not just a ghost story as it also carefully manipulates your mind and shows the downward spiral of the lead character as she investigates the paranormal.Rebecca Hall is truly excellent in her role. They establish her very quickly as a smart, well educated woman who is a skeptic and jaded in some way. She is riveting to watch her performance as her emotions run high further into the film. She leads the cast effortlessly and shows some real chops in her role. Dominic West is good in his role, though seems to pale in comparison to Hall. His character isn't delved into quite as much so he remains a little more mysterious but he is good. The chemistry between him and Hall is okay but often feels lacking somehow. Imelda Staunton is good, if not a little typical, in her role as Maud Hill. She does a great job but the character just felt a little stale and like we had seen it done before. You know almost immediately there is more to her than meets the eye. Isaac Hempstead Wright is very good in his role as Tom, the young lad left behind when everyone else has left. I would have liked to have seen him in more depth but he does a great job with what he has.Co-writer and director Nick Murphy is relatively new to the scene but he obviously has an enjoyment of this genre. You can see it in the finely crafted story that appropriately uses the genre elements. Ghost story fans will love this! My issue with the film is that I'm just not sure that the ending is proved by the rest of the film. I feel like there were a lot of inconsistencies in the end that didn't lead up to the twist ending and any good M. Night fan will tell you that you have to drop the smallest of clues to make the end make sense. The ending is very convoluted but in a good way. Its a smart ending and you have to stay focused so I can't fault the film makers for being clever. Its lack of originality hurts it only a little and if you love the genre, then its well worth seeing. Despite its faults, it gave me thrills and chills and entertained so check it out!! 7/10",The Awakening
16,Lejink,Ghosts of war,7,27 October 2013,"Despite its bland, unimaginative title, I found this a taut, well-wrought ghost film. At times, the plotting reminded me of earlier genre-classics like ""The Shining"", ""The Others"" and especially ""The Innocents"", the latter based on Henry James's definitive ""The Turn Of The Screw"", all being concerned with the precarious psychological condition of the main character and of course of unhappy spirits from the past returning to impact on the present.The present here, though, is immediately post-war England, and the tragedy and tension of those times, with the themes of the loss of what Seigfreid Sassoon called doomed youth, the psychological (and physical) scars on those that survived the Great War while their friends perished (personified here in the character of Mallory) as well as the enmity between those that fought and those that didn't (the latter portrayed in the character of Judd, the school caretaker), loom large in the character studies presented here.At its heart however is the complex character Florence, a vintage if very young, ""ghost- buster"" if you will, herself bearing guilt over her part in the loss of her own soldier sweetheart, eventually takes on, at Mallory's beseeching, a new case, involving the unexplained death of a young boy pupil at a remote boarding school, supposedly haunted by an earlier pupil from years before. The story takes many twists and turns with some scares and jumps along the way, revealing its major twist effectively and by the end just about explains its complexities although I'm sure there are still some strands I'm not quite connecting in the summing up. The period is evoked excellently, the cold, austere boarding school in particular and the acting too is very good by all especially Imelda Taunton as the the school matron whose importance to the story becomes clearer as it progresses and particularly Rebecca Hall as the central character of Florence, her haunted eyes and blank expression well conveying the fragility of her character beneath her initially super-confident Holmes-ian demeanour.If I have a criticism, it is that the Florence character is probably too overloaded with her various neuroses plus a lot happens to her in the narrative, but as in the end, it turns out to be all about her anyway, maybe I should grant the director and writer a little more licence.Anyway, more psychologically thrilling than downright scary, this was my type of ghost film, just right for a late night viewing.",The Awakening
17,paul2001sw-1,A very British shining,5,28 September 2013,"'The Awakening' opens with a 'Downton Abbey' style backdrop, the Harry Potter train, and a thoroughly modern heroine investigating the paranormal in post-World War One Britain. When it starts to get mysterious, it steps up a gear: the first shock is a real one. But the incessant use of jump cuts, sudden appearance of ghosts from nowhere, and dramatic background music, soon starts to tire: these are familiar tricks for conjuring horror, and are somewhat overused here. The film then descends into sub-'Shining' silliness and unlikely coincidence, while the eventual ending feels over-drawn out. I think the problem is that the film's writers seem never quite to have worked out what their creation is supposed to be about: it has elements of a detective story, a horror story, a tale of recovered memory and a parable about grief. But in trying to be all of these, it does none of them convincingly.",The Awakening
18,bowmanblue,Engaging and creepy,7,29 May 2014,"Perhaps the biggest thing 'The Awakening' has going for it is its setting. The huge house/school in the countryside truly is the stuff ghost stories are made of. It looks visually stunning (in an ancient and creepy kind of way) whichever angle it's filmed from. You can't help but believe that there has to be at least a few spooks running around somewhere.Rebecca Hall basically plays a nineteen-twenties Ghostbuster (or rather Ghost-disprover, as she specialises in proving to the world that ghosts don't exist). She gets called to a school to disprove the existence of an alleged ghost who has caused the death of a living boy.Naturally, her investigations lead her to start to doubt her previous beliefs about the lack of real ghosts. There are a few twists and turns and even a handful of red herrings. Don't try to figure it out too much, it'll explain itself eventually. But if you're hoping for every last detail being explained, you may find yourself scouring internet message boards for answers.It's spooky, it's well-shot and it has a few bits that make you jump. Best of all, it has an overall premise that hasn't already been done (to my knowledge). Give it a chance.

19,cosmo_tiger,A movie that is OK but not as good as Woman In Black. The horror is very Shining like and it is slow but worth seeing. I say C+,6,17 December 2012,"""You can't hurt what doesn't exist."" In England after WWI the country is overwhelmed by grief. A boarding school has begun to experience ghostly visions of dead children. A woman named Florence (Hall) is hired to come in and expose the hoax and put everyone's mind at rest. Little by little she begins to question herself. I have to say that this movie is very hard to review. It started off pretty slow then got more interesting then slowed down, then got scary, then slowed down, then had a great twist. The movie itself is OK but it was so inconsistent that I found it hard to pay attention to the entire time. After the ""Woman In Black"" movies like this have been taken to a new level and this would have been better if it came out before that one. The horror is very psychological and really more ""Shining"" like then anything. Overall, a movie worth seeing but be prepared for slow moments. I give it a C+.",The Awakening
20,callanvass,A ponderous ghost story that fails to inject any life into the genre,5,8 January 2014,"In all honesty, this has everything it takes to be a solid ghost film. I love how old fashioned it was, and how it didn't rely on cheap scare tactics to tell it's story. Unfortunately, it is so mundane that I had trouble paying attention at certain points. I love a ghost story that takes time to tell a solid story, but nothing interesting happens. This movie really should have taken some notes on how to build a ghost story efficiently from the movie, The Others. I did like the 1900's setting. It managed to mirror the time period precisely with the sets, costumes, and the atmosphere. The cinematography is excellent as well. The mystery itself is rather convoluted. It has a big twist at the end of the movie, and I thought it was poorly done. It just felt a bit ridiculous. Rebecca Hall is very good. Her character is very standoffish, but she did an excellent job, despite being a bit hard to warm up to. The fact that this movie is distinctly average isn't her fault. Dominic West plays a decent dude for once. Usually, he plays a prick whenever I see him. Imelda Staunton is excellent as well as Maud. Overall, the performances aren't enough to make this ghost story worth your while. It was far from terrible, just disappointing, and uninteresting. 5/10",The Awakening
21,tabuno,A Great Period Occult Movie,9,15 January 2019,"20 October 2014. If one combined the immersive period atmosphere of the movie haunting classic of Peter Weir's Picnic At Hanging Rock (1975) with the twists found in Ann Hathaway's performance in Passengers (2008) or Leo DeCaprio's performance in Shutter Island (2010) along with a twist to these twists one might replicate the themes and experiences found in The Awakening. However, such a twist as in this movie is much more subtle then Planet of the Apes (1968) or even The Sixth Sense (1999). Nor is this occult horror as shocking or deliberately blatant as class standard of horror films The Exorcist (1973). Instead using some of the same suggestive techniques of the surprise blockbuster The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Lovely Bones (2009), The Awakening offers up a surprisingly entertaining, slowly evolving mystery thriller without the hard-hitting shocks that results in both a bitter sweet but nonetheless truly satisfying ending. In some ways, this is the counter point more uplifting version to Christian Slater's performance in He Was A Quiet Man (2007) or like Lesley-Ann Down's experience in Nomads(1986).",The Awakening
22,leplatypus,Uneven but a bit chilling anyway (tv),7,31 October 2015,"This is a sort of Dr. Jones / ghost-busters / Dana Scully / Ichabod Crane transplanted in England at the start of the XXth century. So it's science vs paranormal with the originality to have a woman playing the part. Rebecca breathes British education, glamour and talent so she is the perfect pick. However, after a strong start and really chilly moments, the movie starts to get fragile as her character seems actually terrified by paranormal : It's not really believable that such a character fights to explain paranormal if she is afraid ! Then, the story gets even more weirder as the phenomena get personal but there is again some strong moments ! So my conclusion is my summary : one of the few movies that put me uneasy but with a story too far-fetched , thus a bit unbelievable like a ghost !",The Awakening

26,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A true ghost story,8,24 August 2015,"The Awakening is a sly ghost story, and slipped by mostly unnoticed in 2012. The trailer suggests some scary genre thrills, and while there are a few, most of the trauma that befalls the characters is of interpersonal nature, the demons of their past proving to be far more haunting than any supernatural spooks hiding in the closet. It's isn't without its paranormal jump scares though, but they are nicely blended with the story and personal conflicts of the characters, giving them earned purpose. Rebecca Hall fares excellently ras as a paranormal investigator from circa early 30's London, brought out to the foggy moors of northern england to a grandiose, austere boys boarding school, where some mysterious phenomena has been reported. She reluctantly takes the journey, convinced by one of the teachers (Dominic West) a haunted world war one veteran with demons of his own. She arrives and is subjected to a dank, lonely atmosphere that's chilling enough without being haunted. The boys are muted, frightened waifs, the teachers besides West a morose bunch. She starts prying around, and digs up some secrets that she wished she hadn't. The moody marshlands and gaunt, gilded halls of the building provide a wealth of haunted house atmosphere for us to feast on. But it's a slow burn, with no loud, ridiculous red herring scares or ill placed grotesque cheap thrills. Joseph Mawle makes our skin crawl as an unsettling grounds keeper, Imelda Staunton is even more terrifying than in Harry Potter, if that's possible, and Shaun Dooley is wonderful as a broken man and colleague of West's. This film and The Woman In Black came out the same year, and are very similar on paper. The Awakening is the better execution though, and you need look no further to find a spine chiller that's anchored in a relatable, human story that truly surprises you in the end, and not a cheesy, plodding mess like Woman In Black. Perfect choice for anyone who likes a creepy horror with a big payoff that honors it's characters and it's vision.",The Awakening
27,drownnnsoda,"Solid visuals and performances, but tonally uneven",7,22 December 2016,"""The Awakening"" follows Florence Cathcart, an atheist in 1921 England whose career has been based on disproving faux psychics. She is invited by Robert Mallory, the headmaster of a remote boarding school, to assess the apparent ghost of a child who has been tormenting (and possibly causing the deaths of) the current children. I went into this film a bit skeptical myself, as the plot outline rings of just about every contemporary ghost film out there. This one has the distinguishing factor of being a period piece, which is quite nicely done, and while the film does offer some solid twists and turns, it isn't a landslide success. Where the film does hit its marks is in atmosphere and performances. The cinematography is lovely and the film has a cold, ominous sensibility akin to ""The Others."" Foggy forests and the empty hallways of the sprawling school lend the film a deliciously creepy atmosphere. The performances are also strong, with Rebecca Hall as a formidable and convincing lead; Dominic West plays her counterpoint as the headmaster of the school.Where the film seems to lose its bearings is in plot and tone. Some have complained that the narrative is convoluted or difficult to follow, which I didn't think was necessarily the case—in fact, that twists of the last half hour were quite intriguing— but it also begins to feel like a film that doesn't really have an identity. It haphazardly turns into a borderline murder-thriller for one moment before reverting back to its original ghost story obligations, and then awkwardly turning inward to Hall's character with a sentimental twist. It is not so much convoluted in terms of narrative, but convoluted in tone; the flashback scenes near the end are also awkwardly edited, which is a shame as they are key to the film's real clout.Overall, ""The Awakening,"" in spite of its shortcomings, is a considerably mature and effective ghost story. It does feel tonally uneven which is probably its greatest pitfall. That said, Hall's performance is great and understated, and the film captures a chilly, early-twentieth-century England phenomenally. It's not a flawless film, but as far as ghost stories go, it's one of the better of its contemporaries. 7/10.",The Awakening
28,p-stepien,Surprisingly stale,3,19 January 2013,"Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) is a conceited and renowned expert in the otherworld of ghastly ghosts. Or to more exact - an expert in demonstrating that they do not exist and uncovering parlour tricks used to create illusions of their presence. Nonetheless each and every time she disproves another false ghost, Florence sighs in anguish, almost hoping that her conviction were misplaced. When Robert Mallort (Dominic West) arrives from a boy's boarding school in Rockford, Cumbria, where a boy was supposedly murdered by a ghost, she reluctantly agrees to aide him. On arrival, she is welcomed by governess Maud (Imelda Staunton), who shows an very intense admiration for Cathcart. Florence immediately sets out to scientifically explain the ghostly apparitions.Similar in tone and atmosphere to ""The Others"", Nick Murphy explores the haunting corridors of a vast run-down boarding school, together with all its creaking secrets and dimly lit corners. Despite my intense liking for old-fashioned ghost stories, ""The Awakening"" however failed in intrigue and turn on, quickly falling into traps of formulaic treatment. A far cry for recreating lasting suspense and - more importantly - an interest in the mansion's mystery, it plods out to a somewhat surprising, but ultimately dreary conclusion, which feels as if ripped off from a nameless ghost flick already seen. Despite some splendid visuals the overall feel just missed a touch of individual flair, making it overly repetitive for anyone with a wider outlook on similar movies. The disjointed narrative naturally does not help proceedings, as it jumps around failing to really get a hold of whatever key story it was telling - rushed in some places, sleepily overstaying its welcome in others.",The Awakening
29,raulfaust,Visions,5,26 February 2014,"Florence Cathcart is a book writer that tries to explain every supposed ghostly apparition, given that she believes there's no such thing as phantasm. After some people insisting on the idea of the existence of a ghost in some kind of orphanage, she goes there in order to check what is going on. As she gets in the ambient, there are lots of confusing moments that never let you know what exactly happened. What bores me the most is how a horror movie released in 2011 can STILL stick with the same formulaic aspects all past movies have used: a child that draws weird things, the past accident in the place that murdered somebody, the bath tube scene, among others. In fact, the bath tube scene creeped me out, although it was COMPLETELY predictable and I could obviously see that coming. The sad thing is that sometimes it tries to be ""The Others"", but has no such originality or clarity to explain what is going on. I don't know about you guys, but the movie ended and I couldn't tell who was dead, alive, what was real and what was not. I mean, if the boy was the only one alive, why could his mother and the other guy talk to him? Other than that, the photography direction is regular, and it helps making the film feel nostalgic, but that's all. Regular flick that brings nothing to the genre.",The Awakening
30,begob,Gentle,5,9 February 2015,"Elaborate ghost story with a twist.I enjoyed it, but it's really a melodramatic yarn. All the women have their way, and the men are mad, bad or useless. Also some rose-coloured, polite eroticism.It's BBC, so top quality production but a serious lack of edge in the characters and preachy on discrimination against women. Most interesting character is Nanny, because her motivation drives the story. They had an excellent actress for the part, but the writers held back to avoid giving away the plot.Some spooky parts, but nothing inspired. And oh dear - the closing door jump is pressed into action once again. I did sense the final twist coming, and in the end we get a sort of Blithe Spirit vibe. So that's alright then - we can sleep easy.Music is zig-zag strings, ending in a giant swell. Why not contemporary music? Every other horror uses it for scares - you know, crackling vinyl and thin, reedy voices.One thing puzzled me - they drew attention to Caravaggio's Judith & Holofernes. The point was woman dominating man, and then I thought it was a clever reference to the lighting when the heroine shines a lamp in the darkness. But plot connection? None.",The Awakening

Rebecca Hall's The Awakening is an interesting thriller. This takes you deep into the beginning of believers and non believers. The Awakening is shot at the stunning locals and house. This makes its really scary and fascinating. At least I was on edge of my seat the whole time, how the movie unfolds the secrets behind the ghosts. Rebecca Hall is really impressive in the movie and she shows why she deserves to be here. Even though she is great it's still not the role which will make her the breakout star of Hollywood.

32,rivertam26,"An elegant, solid but expected ghost story",7,15 August 2012,"The Awakening is pretty much what you would expect it to be. It's well made with gorgeous cinematography and strong performances from its cast. And the story if unsurprising is solidly made and well told. The film is directed well and builds a nice amount of suspense throughout. At times its confusing because of the sheer amount of convoluted ideals being thrown around. The story concerns an educated young woman who debunks ghost theories. She is approached by the headmaster of a school to help out with a problem concerning the boys being frightened there. After some convincing she arrives at the location and begins her investigation. Many secrets are discovered and it builds to a somewhat expected finale. For those of you who've seen the brilliant films The Others, The Orphanage and The Devil's Backbone there's not much new here. Still it's competently made and there is a nice slow burn of suspense even culminating in some surprising scares and plot twists. Overall it's a old fashioned classic spook fest with a bit of wit and borrowed imagination from slightly better films. A bonus scene features sexy Dominic West in a solid performance shedding his clothes which is much appreciated but unnecessary like the other ""bathtub"" scene. And there seems to be niche with that running through the proceedings it's almost as if the people involved with making the film knew they had something that wasn't the most original concept so they threw in unnecessary things to kind of lead you astray it's a little manipulative on their part but keeps you engaged as a viewer and you don't feel too cheated at the films conclusion. Overall it's an elegant, solid but expected ghost story.",The Awakening

34,antoniotierno,scary and original,6,12 December 2011,"Director Nick Murphy and his co-writer Stephen Volk get to deliver an effective and unusual 1920s-set tale. Rebecca Hall, whom I had first seen in a Woody Allen's movie, plays a convincing character. The rest of the cast is not well known as the British actress but they seem to be in place when trying to discover a rational explanation of all the events taking place in the story. Unfortunately things get worse and less believable in the third part and much of tension and ambiguity previously created is lost in melodrama and unlikeliness.

Florence Cathcart is a ghost hunter who loves to visit the places hounded by ghost sightings and unravels the mystery around it. She has been assigned a task to solve the mystery of missing child in a boarding school and soon realizes that there are more consequences than as she unravels the truth behind it.First time director , Nick Fury , choose a challenging narrative which is like a mystery novel. The more you read about it , the deeper you will go down the rabbit hole. But it is the ending which is fruitful and satisfying, the director is successful in keeping you intrigued for full 98 minutes. You will be on your toes waiting for something to come-up the very next scene. Watch out for the last 15 minutes of climax which play a crucial part in the storyline. Few scenes manages to scare you but this flick is more of story-telling. Nevertheless, the movie has its share of flaw. The screenplay has few loop holes as well. The chemistry between Dominic west and Rebecca Hall is half-baked and looks forced. The editor could have trimmed by further 10 mins. However, performance by Rebecca Hall compensates for that. She plays the character of Florence Cathcart with conviction. The woman whose childhood was horrible and yet managing to fights back is superbly portrayed by her. The beautiful location of Ireland has been captured effectively with good background score. Overall , a very satisfactory thrilling flick with few scary scenes and one fine performance by Rebecca Hall makes it a compelling watch. Good",The Awakening

40,Prichards12345,Looks good but often resorts to clichés and the plot is just silly,5,25 June 2012,"The Awakening is a story of a 1920s female ghost hunter and debunker who is called upon to investigate a supposed haunting at a private boarding school. While it features committed performances from the actors we have been here before many times. Basically it's just a reworking of The Sixth Sense and The Others (spoiler here) instead of the central character or characters being dead it turns out to be someone featured in the narrative, and while the movie conjures up some effective moments after an hour it pretty much falls apart.It opens with that old canard the séance debunked. Rebecca Hall gives a good performance as the debunker, and whether you accept the eventual explanation given for her behaviour at the end of the movie depends on how far you've bought into it. Personally I found only the middle section of the movie really working - from the moment Hall arrives at the school until she has her first fit of hysterics. After that I thought it descended into farce.The movie is extremely well-photographed, however, and it's shame that a British ghost/horror movie should turn out to be something of a damp squib. I really wanted to like it - the UK brought Gothic horror back into fashion in the 50s - and how we could do with a renaissance of this kind now. But I have to say I just don't think it works. The Orphanage is a much better movie, as are the previously mentioned films.",The Awakening
41,ersinkdotcom,'The Awakening' has everything you want in a classic Gothic ghost tale,8,23 February 2013,"What is it about England that makes it the perfect setting for ghost stories? Is it the rainy and bleak weather? The turn-of-the-century period décor has something to do with it I'm sure. From Sherlock Holmes mysteries to ""The Woman in Black"" and ""The Others,"" it seems Merry Ole England stands in the public eye as one of the most haunted countries in the world. BBC Films continues to feed this perception with the beautifully frightful ""The Awakening.""The England of 1921 is suffering from the aftermath of World War I. Many people look to spiritualists for comfort by contacting those dead and missing through different occult avenues. Hoax exposer Florence Cathcart travels the country debunking charlatans who use rigged séances and elaborate trickery to fool the innocent looking for answers from the afterlife. The skeptical woman is hired to investigate the appearances of a ghost boy at a secluded boarding school in the countryside. After several attempts at pinning the specters on mischievous students, Cathcart fights to prove to herself that the supernatural events she's experiencing aren't real.It's evident that Director / Co-writer Nick Murphy had more on his mind when making ""The Awakening"" than what initially shows up on screen. He states in the extra features that the movie explores the reaction England had to the First World War and uses that as the basis for the events and attitudes of the characters. Florence Cathcart lost her belief in God or the afterlife because her fiancé was killed in the war. Almost everyone in the film was affected in some way by the war, whether it is directly or indirectly.Murphy used the time period to his advantage and created an effectively disturbing and gripping tale. It has some great twists and a wonderful setting in the quiet gray halls of an abandoned boarding house. Just don't expect the same types of jump-scares we get in Hollywood horror stories. ""The Awakening"" is sophisticated and provides its frights a little at a time.Every actor in ""The Awakening"" delivers a standout performance. Imelda Staunton does a fabulous job playing the over-protective and nervous housekeeper named Maud Hill. Rebecca Hall completely embraces her unbelieving character and shifts through a huge range of emotions with ease as Florence Cathcart.Viewing ""The Awakening"" is as pleasurable an experience as you can have watching a Gothic horror story. Everything you want in a classic ghost tale is present - a big dark house, suspicious characters, and spectral presences. It also offers many deeper reflections on life than what we get from most modern American horror films.",The Awakening

Robert also informs Florence of a murder at the school of a young pupil, Walter Portman. After arriving, the school closes for half term so Florence is left alone with 3 other people - Mallory, Maud Hill (the school's mistress) and a young pupil, Tom Hill (who is staying there due to his parents being in India). Free to investigate, it's not long before Florence discovers what happened to Walter, but other strange activities start happening also, so she is determined to find out what it really going on.The Awakening isn't too bad of a British horror/thriller and actually has quite a decent - if somewhat slightly confusing - story. The movie starts off pretty well, but after about 30 - 40 minutes in, it just drags on a bit. However, it does pick up again after the main twist of the movie, of which there are a few, and even when you get to the end, you're still left thinking about a few things.There are no standout performances, but it's a decently acted movie with good settings as well with the main one being the large boarding school set in a very remote part of Cumbria (which is actually Manderston House in Berwickshire, Scotland).The movie is filmed well to portray early '20s England and it does actually feel like that era when watching the movie. There's a few decent creepy moments throughout to keep it going, but overall it was just a wee bit too slow for my liking and I found it hard to get into at times. Other than that, it was a decent supernatural movie.",The Awakening
44,bregund,Tepid and Derivative,4,30 October 2013,"I just saw this film after a recommendation from a friend and I was disappointed. I expected a beguiling, atmospheric film but got a watered-down version of The Others infused with every haunted-house movie cliché over the last twenty years. My biggest problem with the film lies in Florence's lack of memory about the house she grew up in: this is very poor writing. If this apparently intelligent, lucid woman honestly can't remember that she's visiting a house that she used to live in, can't remember her father, and can't recognize her own dead brother, there needs to be some clearly-established precedent early in the film, otherwise it just appears to be a convenient deception on the part of the writers.Other issues: there is no explanation for the father going nuts and taking out his family; Florence has zero gentility associated with the women of the time; it's confusing who knows which person is a ghost at what time; and little boys don't play with dolls or dollhouses. I found Florence unpleasant and rude, even when she was softened up by subsequent events. Why is Tom's face distorted, he wasn't shot in the face. The settings are gorgeous, but they certainly don't match the mediocre writing. And when Robert says ""there are only three of us here,"" which three is he talking about, does it include the creepy caretaker? All in all, this film felt like a sequel to The Others, which wasn't even that great a film to begin with.",The Awakening

Only the British can pull off films like this with such style and beauty! DAMN this was a good film : )Well, my Summary pretty much says it. The trouble with reviewers here is that they almost always just give you their particular response to the film, BUT they many times do NOT address the fact as to whether it is OBJECTIVELY a good or bad one. Obviously, if British Gothic Ghost Stories bore you or just don't do it for you, well then, DUHHHHHH! you're likely gonna come here and say 'That was dull', 'Boring', or 'No scares', etc... Time after time after time I see where people come here and P!$$ all over excellent films just because THEY didn't like them... WRONG...(sigh...) Very simply... IF you indeed do happen to like atmospheric, picturesque, haunting, slow building, and extremely well executed British Ghost Stories, then HELL yeah, you will love it. What is there not to love...? BUT... if you find that kind of movie slow, boring, and NOT scary, then, NO, of course you will not like it. That, I hope, is an actually HELPFUL review. A review should state the objective quality of the film, the good or bad in specific ways, and then their personal impressions. And, hopefully that will help people to tell whether they would enjoy the movie or not. They should NOT just come here and dump all over a type of film that they don't like anyway.This is one of THE very best films of it's kind that I have seen. Beautifully produced, well paced, acted, directed, and very nice use of sound and cinematography. And there were even moments where I had to change my pants! The suspense and tension were wonderfully built, along with some genuinely chilling atmosphere.I've mentioned this before, but I don't come here and deliberately choose types of films that I KNOW I don't like and then proceed to trash the living $h!T out of them. What's the point? What good is it going to do you to read my review of say, 'HOSTEL' and see me give it 2 stars and tell you all about why I hate it...? Others who actually LIKE those kinds of films won't really be helped by that. So, I DON'T do that! And I wish others had a 'ghost' of sense not to do this also.So, in a case where the reviews are so polarized like with this movie, you need to look carefully at the Summaries. The ones who say things like 'BRILLIANT!', 'Great Ghost Story', etc... Those are reviews of people who LIKE these kinds of films. They found it entertaining and gave it a rating of 9 or 10 like I did. And, if YOU are the kind of person who also likes these kinds of films, you probably will also like it! Conversely, if you see Summaries that say 'BORING' 'No scares' 'Lame', then those are from people who DON'T like these kind of movies. If you feel the same way about these kinds of films, then that will help you too.Hopefully, this will make it a little easier for you to be able to tell if you would truly enjoy this film or not...",The Awakening

Elsewhere (in other reviews on this board) it has been called 'pretentious' and 'derivative' and 'full of haunted house clichés'. Well, you're never going to boil the perfect egg, but you can do it well or you can do it badly, and the The Awakening does what it sets out to do rather well. You get an intriguing, rather touching ghost story which most certainly sends shivers up your spine at the right moments.It seems to me that all too often folk have forgotten what it is to be entertained rather well. They will, on the one hand, gladly put up with a lot of formulaic dreck they have seen 1,000 before, whether it is 'action', 'comedy', schmaltzy 'rom-com', sentimental 'drama' or an oh-so predictable 'thriller', but when they are presented with well-made, well-acted entertaining film such as The Awakening, they start picking nits as though there were no tomorrow.Of course it's complete hokum - what ghost story isn't? - but, as I said, it sets out to do something, and does that very well.

The belief in ghosts led to a rise of phony mediums and hoax filled séances. Grief stricken people were easy prey to phony con men and women who disguised themselves as mediums who could contact their loved ones for a price. Florence Cathcart is a Gothic Ghostbuster as she exposes one phony after another. Her Best Seller of a book SEeingthru Ghosts is on the bookshelves beside the bible in many homes. But Florence is unhappy. No matter how many criminals she exposes or how many people she helps. Something inside refuses to let her feel happy. And then a case comes right to her door. Robert Mallory of a school for boy's has a intense tale of a haunting. As he tells her the students are scared badly and one of them has died. Was it the ghost ? Is the school haunted ? Florence senses a case that has everything she has been looking for. Upon arrival Florence quickly goes to work. She makes friends with the school's maid a friendly older woman named Maude and a young friendless boy named Tom. As the Holiday's arrive and the School lets out Florence uncovers some things that should be remained covered. As she digs deeper Florence is pulled deeper into a mystery. And she finds her beliefs challenged and her mind and soul are put to the test. Florence finds out that not everything can be explained and that somethings should'Be best been left alone.A atomspheric film that's intense and well told. A Ghost Story without the gory and shock effects some films use so well. And a Better story then most of them. An Easy companion to films like the Others or The Turn of the Screw.A Wonderful film that delivers the chills the way they used to be. Subtle and chilling at the same time.,The Awakening
51,yris2002,"A well crafted, traditional ghost story, with some flaws",7,24 December 2011,"The movie does not sound original, in terms of plot and style, it is a very old-style ghost story, built according to the most traditional but still effective means in pictures like these, where the supernatural has to find its ways. Creaking doors, mysterious sounds, light and dark play, set in a solitary gloomy mansion in the English countryside, are part of the oldest tradition of scary movies, the plot twists are also not new, but the impression I got is that of a simple, well crafted ghost story, with an interesting psychological insight, that without needing exaggerated sci-fi effects gets to appeal and entertain the viewer till the end. A good English cast helps give insight to the the frailty and fears of its characters, and to make up for some flaws in the picture, above all a rather hasty and underdeveloped finale, as opposed to some slowness in the previous parts.",The Awakening
52,Chris_Pandolfi,Is That a ... G-G-G-Ghost?,7,17 August 2012,"""The Awakening"" plays it safe as far as supernatural thrillers go, providing audiences with such reliable hallmarks as a melodramatic plot, an ending with several twists, and plenty in the way suspense and shocks. That it's unoriginal, there can be no question. Nevertheless, there's no denying the skill that went into it. It is, above all, an incredibly good-looking film; the atmosphere is one of perpetual gloom, the sun shrouded by gray clouds, the rooms of the old boarding house faded and decaying, the overall color scheme muted drearily. It mostly takes place in an isolated area of the English countryside, and in a fairly open field of dark gray grass and overgrown trees, a piece of old architecture juts into the sky menacingly. The only noticeable departure is that, in spite of the washed-out colors, much of the scenery is not concealed in shadows. That style is reserved only for a select number of scenes, most of which are featured in the final act.Taking place in 1921, the story opens in London, where a woman named Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) has made it her life's mission to debunk claims of supernatural phenomena and expose so-called mediums and spiritualists. And before I go any further, no, this movie is not a retread of ""Red Lights,"" which not only examined the debate between faith and reason in a much more ambiguous way but was also focused on psychic powers rather than paranormal activity. Florence presents herself as a committed skeptic, going so far as to write a book called ""Seeing Through Ghosts."" But as the film progresses and her defensive layers gradually peel away, it becomes obvious that her crusade is less about convincing the general public and more about convincing herself. Let it suffice to say that her reasons stem from emotions rather than by scientific curiosity.One day, she's approached by Robert Mallory (Dominic West), a shellshocked World War I veteran who now teaches at a secluded all-boys boarding school outside the city. He wants her to investigate the recent death of one of the students, which ties into numerous reported sightings of a boy's ghost, the image of which has inexplicably shown up in group photos dating back to 1902. Florence's explanation of the boy's diffused image is logical enough, although she has yet to account for why the last photo, taken only weeks earlier, shows the boy looking out one of the building's windows. She initially refuses to involve herself, but in due time, she comes around. And so she travels with Robert to the boarding school, a bleak, borderline Dickensian world of strict regiment and harsh punishments. The teachers and staff skulk around, their eyes betraying fear, anger, and deep secrets. The boys stand around in constricting uniforms, their heads lowered guiltily.Upon her arrival, Florence meets the housekeeper, who insists on being called Maud (Imelda Staunton). She's a right bundle of nerves, hovering around Florence with nothing but praise for her book and yet always seeming to know more than she's letting on. Always at Maud's side is a boy named Tom (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), a lonely orphan who inexplicably turns to Florence for solace. She sets up a series of still cameras, wire trips, powder trays for tracking footprints, and various pieces of machinery that would have been considered the latest in technology in 1921 – assuming they existed at all, and you'll forgive me for having no interest in doing the research. It's all in an effort to prove to the boys that there is no ghost wandering the halls. But ... what if there really is a ghost? How else to explain the strange occurrences that keep happening, some of which are rather startling?To make the story about something more than the possibility of a spirit haunting an old boarding school, the filmmakers work in a mutual attraction between Florence and Robert, one that inevitably turns physical. It begins with a moment that could have been directly lifted from an erotic drama; while preparing a room with booby traps, Florence discovers that a hole in the wall gives her a view of the bathroom, and lo and behold, Robert emerges naked from the bathtub and treats a gaping wound on his right thigh. I'm not convinced of this subplot's necessity, although I will say that I appreciated the effort to make the film a character study as well as a supernatural thriller. Dominic West, known for his villain roles, at last is given the chance to play a sympathetic character, one who is, in a sense, haunted by his own ghosts.The final act, which is surprisingly sentimental, requires high suspension of disbelief in order to seem even somewhat plausible. Is that to be expected from a movie like this? I suppose so, although even ghost stories have their limits. Still, there's a definite emotional payoff, one that stems from a logical progression of the plot and appropriate development of the characters. And let it not be said that the art direction, set design, cinematography, and costumes aren't put to good use. This film comes only six months after the release of ""The Woman in Black,"" another suspenseful, atmospheric ghost story made by Hammer Studios in the tradition of classic horror movies. I found it incredibly satisfying, in large part because of its sense of style. ""The Awakening"" isn't quite up to that level, but it certainly accomplishes what it set out to accomplish.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",The Awakening
53,Catharina_Sweden,Very scary and with a good story as well!,9,19 March 2012,"This was the best horror movie I have seen for several years! It has got everything: a solid plot, a shocking twist near the end, a creepy feeling followed with several real jumps, suspense, good psychology, good acting... It is getting the atmosphere both of the period (shortly after World War I), and of a boarding school just right. There is also a strong and masculine attractive man, a believable love story and some hot sex in it..! :-)""The Awakening"" has a lot in common both with ""The Others"" and ""The Orphanage"", so if you loved those this is a must-see!",The Awakening
54,FairlyAnonymous,"Some good camera work here and there, but mostly a mash-up of better films",5,6 June 2015,"I will not lie and say that The Awakening was a poorly MADE movie, but I will say that it essentially tore any goodness that it had into pieces, burned them, and then quickly attempted to put them back together; as if they never burned in the first place.The Awakening (yeah, another ""The"" horror movie) stars Rebecca Hall has a ""modern woman"" in London who hunts down ghosts and reveals the truths behind it. She is essentially a female Sherlock Holmes mixed with Scooby Doo. She apparently lost someone close to her, her parents, and has since become a strong independent woman. Now, I wouldn't say this in a cynical manner if it weren't for the fact that she is SUPER modern. The way she acts and dresses at times is much more typical of someone... eh 50-70 years ahead of the time period. There is nothing wrong with a strong female character, but when they seem to tear out of their time period it kind of... loses the atmosphere... and this movie tries a lot to have a good atmosphere.Essentially, she has one last big case to do where she needs to go to a boarding school and solve the crime of a ghost child that has been haunting the place for awhile... and has led to a new death. She thinks she has solved the case at first, but things start to get strange, so she stays to solve the entire mystery. On her side is a man who works there, a lady who attends there, and a little boy named Tom.Aaaaannnndddd... then the movie starts to make fun of the audience's intelligence. This strong independent woman decides to have super cliché sex with a man she has only just met... and to make things worse she does it within about .5 seconds after discovering that the ghosts are real. It truly doesn't make any sense. This character suddenly has a photograph of the ghost and then turns to the male character and vigorously makes out with him... and then they tear down the blinds which leads to all of their photographs of the ghost being destroyed.This is the point in the movie where you can almost smell someone burning the script. It is as if someone said ""You know this strong character who has been independent and all and is all about the evidence? The second she gets that evidence, let's have her have sex because she no longer feels independent and then have her DESTROY that evidence in the act... yeah... this is a good idea *sips tea*.""But it gets worse! Not five minutes later, the groundskeeper tries to rape her... completely out of nowhere. This scene has nothing to do with the plot, and it ends up with him dying, but it makes no sense at all.And eventually we get to the movie's infamous and most obvious plot- twist. Tom (the little boy) was the ghost all along *buh bum BUUUMMMM*. What makes this plot-twist painful is that it was the most obvious idea, so I automatically assumed that it couldn't be. Throughout the entire movie, this kid is not only never talked to by any of the other characters (in a direct manner, that is), but he also dresses and looks EXACTLY like the ghost they are hunting for. ""Huh, a character who shows in and out of the plot at random, which no one talks to, and looks EXACTLY like the ghost they are hunting for... this better not be taking a Sixth Sense route""Unfortunately, this is where the movie desperately tries to reassemble itself. It tries to make sense of everything in the typical horror movie fashion ""the main character was an important pawn for the ghosts, and she is holding repressed memories"". So our main character turns out to be the sister (kind of) of Tom, and that the person that she lost was... Tom... all along. You think that would be hard thing to forget...Long story short, The Awakening has a nice atmosphere, but it never truly becomes scary at any point. There is this random doll house that had some creepy moments, but it is never explained. One could theorize that the main character owned it as a child, and that Tom was showing it to her to kick-in her memories; however, this is never properly explained or shown... it is just an interesting little jump scare gimmick. All in all, The Awakening had some potential if it wasn't so desperate on the cliché ""everything is a big jumbled mess"" horror movie ending.",The Awakening
55,mirwais-orbit,Not again!,4,16 March 2012,"There are some things quite interesting about this movie. It's well acted, the art design and the reproduction of the time is amazing. The direction is quite good and holds your attention and drowns you into the story.But when the movie culminates to its resolutions, I felt a little disappointed... well, in fact, a lot disappointed! It all starts when Florence (Rebecca Hall) and Robert (Dominic West) have sex, till that moment the movie was great for me. But that happening was unnecessary for the plot development. OK, both were completely strangers and lonely in an era where casual sex was against the minds of that time and Rebecca's behavior clearly was for her loneliness and the lack of an affectionate sexual life. But anyway, that was simply thrown freely into the story and their approach should have been different and the meaning would still remain the same. From that on the movie was just a show of messy resolutions.First of all, since The Sixth Sense (1999) this plot about ghosts and children are saturated and overdone, and since there are no longer any other interesting resolutions writers are lately figuring out that the exit for it all is mix every movie's conclusion and give a tone of something completely interesting and new when it truly is not. The Sixth Sense (1999), Stir Of Echoes (1999), The Others (2001) and The Orphanage (2007), you can find a little of them all in this one. But instead of providing an amazing surprise, it just take a tired ""not that again"" sentence from the audience.Really disappointing. The writers took the most difficult way to offer more of the same.",The Awakening
56,WubsTheFadger,The Awakening,7,10 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story begins with a bang but grinds to a halt. The middle part of the film is very slow and labored. The ending is great. The realizations and the twists are what make the film very good.The pacing is very slow but it builds up towards the end. The pacing is the worst part about the film. The runtime is also overlong.The acting is good.

57,richardwworkman,Stylish and creepy.,6,24 November 2020,"Creepy building, British school children, stylishly shot with plenty of visual tension, The Awakening sets itself up as a classic ghost story.The hook in the story is that the sceptic, Florence Cathcart, is a paranormal investigator who uses the cutting edge scientific methods of the early 20th century to debunk spiritualist tomfoolery. Cathcart however, is emotionally unstable, cursed by her own guilt associated with a lost love, she brings her own ""ghosts"" to the building.This kind of plays out well yet and while Cathcart demonstrates considerable intellectual prowess, her insecurities gradually cloud her judgement and consequently lead her to question her objectivity.There are interesting dynamics between the characters as the story develops and the plot constantly shifts from what is real, psychological or supernatural.Overall this is an engaging and entertaining psychological thriller let down slightly by a formulaic conclusion that seems a bit too familiar. Well worth a watch though.",The Awakening
58,hoytyhoyty,The UK seems to be getting its mojo back,10,15 June 2014,"Real rating: 7/10Blanket disclaimer: From now on if I find a good film to have an absurdly low IMDb rating, I will just give it 10/10 to boost it, then reveal my real rating in the review, as above. I think this is only fair.I was braced for this to be the usual, beautifully shot, interminably dull and depressing pretentiousnessfest that the UK seems to have been churning out the last few decades (and it's infected Hollywood too, 'cept the results are even worse).But the opening grabbed me, and despite some slow points it proved to be a page-turner. There were also a couple of genuine hair-raising scares in it - and from a ghost story, what more can you ask?I only have two minor problems with this film - 1 point off: the main female character, Florence, walks around like she is living in modern times, hair unkempt, top button undone - in 1921! Even if she desported herself that way deliberately, stubbornly, somebody else would have at least commented! Until the early 1950s it was unthinkable for anyone, male or female, to go outside without their hat on! Yet there are bare heads all through the piece, and there were times when Florence could have been standing in an old-styled room that happened to exist in 2014, she did not look remotely 1921'ish. Do your research, or else couch the characters out-of-era behaviour in the dialogue, don't just think you'll get away with it.2 points off: the plot. Obviously I can't give details without a Spoiler warning, but it was a little trite. It tried a bit too hard to be too smart and fell on its face - but only a bit! Overall, as I say above, it was a page-turner.Good film, rate it up.(And omg Rebecca hall is hot).",The Awakening
59,maximovlE,Waste of time.,2,24 February 2020,"This movie looked good. The acting for the most part was good, and it started surprisingly well. Two points for Rebecca Hall, for whom I wanted to add more, but couldn't.The movie plummeted almost half way and continued to spiral out of control into a typical Sunday night BBC TV special. I was slightly put off as soon as I saw the BBC were involved. After a while I'd forgotten, but their hallmark soon returned with gusto. Over dramatised, over acted, simply over in every sense. There's a reason I steer clear of the BBC and this shows why. It's not clever, it's boring, predictable, and simply not very good. If and the soundtrack that sounds like it's been been used a hundred times before, so irritating.Had this movie been found by some real talent before the cameras rolled, maybe something good could have been made from it.",The Awakening

62,dharmendrasingh,A ghost story for grown-ups,7,20 November 2011,"Between 1914 and 1919, one million people lost their lives to  influenza. Society was more ignorant back then. Science and rational  thinking were not then the forces they are today. People were open to  anything, including the possibility of ghosts.  Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) stands out in the London of the  twenties for being a free-thinker and a debunker of the supernatural. A  boarding school teacher (Dominic West) implores her to visit his school  following the death of a pupil, where unexplained sightings are being  reported.   Florence isn't a total sceptic. She leaves some room for belief, which  caused me to note she is agnostic towards ghosts. Essentially, there  are two stories. One is concerning the death of the pupil. The other is  more interesting and distinguishes it from a deluge of other horror  films which have vanished from my mind as quickly as the ghostly  apparitions in them. It focuses on Florence herself, and I shall say no  more as I will not spoil it for you.  This is not a scary film; there are several portents but few frights.  What there is plenty of, however, is suspense. Nick Murphy, in his  feature-length debut, also manages to sustain a melancholy mood,  crucial for his story.   It's no surprise that Rebecca is the daughter of Peter Hall, founder of  the Royal Shakespeare Company. She commands the screen in a way which  would cause many of her peers to blush with envy. Her character is a  difficult one to personify.   Dominic West, he with the simian countenance from the groundbreaking  crime series 'The Wire', is very good as the guilt-ridden  soldier-turned-teacher. Imelda Staunton is effective as the school  matron. She has that look in her eye which is trying to tell us  something.   I'm calling this a grown-up film because the spiritual element becomes  auxiliary. Guilt and loneliness take over as leading themes. Murphy has  the acuity to drop the ghost story  because otherwise it would be a  simulacrum of other period chillers  and focuses on a story of locked  emotion. The denouement is clever and original. The penultimate  revelation would have been a superb ending on its own, so having a  double-twist is all the more impressive.",The Awakening
63,cnycitylady,So Much More than a Ghost Story,8,27 March 2015,"The Awakening is more profound than your average horror story. The movie creeps you out and sets you up for thrills, but behind its shallow spooky facade is an actual tale that demands to be heard.Rebecca Hall is summoned to a boarding school for boys to debunk the rumors of a ghost boy there. She does her job efficiently and quickly but is soon drawn into the mystery of the place. With bumps around every corner and new plot twists that are refreshingly unpredictable and that will leave you reeling, this ghost story will haunt you until the very end.Dominic West, Imelda Staunton, and Isaac Hempstead-Wright round out the cast, and all play their parts very well. This human story is about the ghosts that we see, the ghosts of our pasts, and the ghosts of our future. And we learn that everyone is haunted by these things. 8/10",The Awakening
64,Michael-Hallows-Eve,A ghost story set in 1921. I highly recommend it!,8,30 June 2012,"This movie is well filmed and is a pleasure to watch. The story is involving also and it draws you in from start to finish. There are some good old fashioned scary scenes and near the end there is a plot twist that you never see coming. Dominic West plays his part well as Robert Mallory, an employee of the school who asks Florence (Rebecca Hall) to help find a child ghost who haunts the school. As I said earlier there is a huge twist that I didn't see coming. I don't want to say much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. If you like a good scare and enjoy being surprised, then you need to see this movie. I highly recommend it. I give it a solid 8 out of 10.",The Awakening

And this one is just a BBC Sunday afternoon drama that happens to be about something supernatural ... Maybe ... Half hearted and wishy washy really ... Enjoyable but not very memorable ...

66,saint_brett,Drawn Out Dross,1,15 November 2021,"There's not much appeal about this movie when you pick up the DVD cover - set in the 20's, runs for about an hour and 40-minutes, no name actors. I guess the only thing going for it at the moment is that you don't have to read subtitles.A bunch of cult members gather for morning tea, served up by Hop Sing, and start chanting something about that Korean movie ""Momento Mori"" while eating raw crow, or raven? Is that Hitler there in the middle of all this?Maggie Gyllenhaal shows up and breaks up the charlatan behavior of the satan worshippers with a handful of English bobbies and an old bag, with Princess Leia hair, lashes out and slaps Maggie accusing her of being a maiden.Jack Dempsey then shows up offering a job to go ghosh hunting.I think you'd be better off watching ""The Conjuring"" or ""Haunting in Connecticut.""(Women didn't dress like this in the 20's.)
Accepting Dempsey's ghost job, Maggie travels to a boys reform school and is greeted by a hard boiled faced matron who seems ""coat hanger-ish"" from her Forte addiction to pain killers. (I just invented that word.)
Being tipped off by a boy, who was just caned by a half dead sweaty junkie school teacher, Maggie pulls out her Ichabad Crane science set, which she got from Christmas, and goes hard to capture photographic evidence of apparitions. (Wasn't this chick in ""Army of Darkness?)
The half dead sweaty opiate teacher, with the cane, is accused of killing some missing child and his only defence alibi is to use the word mollycoddled?Maggie and Dempsey stand on the cliffs of Moher as bleak English weather hinders the funeral procession of the dead child, while the hard boiled dumpy servant stands out in the rain talking to herself.Not making an ounce of sense, Maggie tries to drown herself in a pond of knee deep water much to the disgust of the hard boiled hand maiden.Inspired by The Divinyls song ""I Touch Myself,"" Maggie hops in a bathtub of dirty dish water and touches herself then talks to a tiled wall like the demented hard boiled twit earlier? (I have more questions than answers.)These people are all twonks! (That's a British word. Look it up. I only learnt it last week myself.)The dead coffin rabbit, from ""The Wicker Man,"" makes a cameo appearance in a dress and is some sort of McGuffin key to the preservation of the storyline? (The dead rabbit made no sense in ""The Wicker Man"" and it leaves no impression in this crap either. At least the dead rabbit in ""Gangs of N. Y."" served a purpose.)
Movie's just trying to be too complex by introducing silly little twists, while tying itself into a contorted knot, but the actors are so unappealing they're failing to hold my interest. As is the storyline which waned about an hour ago.Um yer, excuse my ignorance, but didn't the half dead sweaty junkie teacher, with the cane, confess to the murder at the start? What's all this ""Sixth Sense"" I'm-dead-without-realising-it-myself hooey?Is there much more of this to go?Oh, yet another movie twist, the hard boiled bat servant, with the straw hair, poisons Maggie at the end to join Oliver Twist in the after life?This movie has just complicated itself. I'm giving it a negative result.Maybe this movie is better than 1/10, and exposed my levels of poor education, as it's too upperclass. Who knows?Either way, I had more fun watching ""LA Street Fighters"" last night.",The Awakening
67,mdnobles19,The most underrated horror film of 2012,8,24 January 2013,"The Awakening is the best old-fashioned ghost story made in modern time since The Others. The film to me was so emotionally powerful, with an engrossing tale of loss, loneliness, grief and fear. Don't go in with expectations of being scared out of your mind even though there is some well executed scares in this film. It's not the type of horror film that really focuses on that element because it doesn't need to rely on it so heavily like most horror movies do these days. The film's strengths are its atmosphere, effective suspense, impeccable performances, a story worth telling and a twist that through me for a loop. The most under appreciated horror film of 2012.Rebecca Hall plays Florence Cathcart, a Hoax exposer who is called to a boarding house to investigate strange paranormal activity. Rebecca is one of the most under used actresses of today! She was so mesmerizing in this role and it's a shame that this didn't get a wide theatrical release so people can see what a great actress she is; this was Oscar worthy to me. The rest of the cast was great too, that include Dominic West who plays Robert Mallory and Imelda Staunton who gives a heartbreaking performance as the caretaker Maud Hill. These characters were so moving and heartfelt and give the story an emotional punch.Director and writer, Nick Murphy shows true talent in his first full length feature film, and has strength as a writer. His ability to capture emotion along with shocks and spooks is breathtaking to me; his film grabs and doesn't let go. He is a director to look out for. Stephen Volk who is no stranger to the horror genre, he also wrote screenplays for Gothic, The Kiss, The Guardian, Superstition and Octane. He shows true growth here as a solid writer for this genre. They should collaborate again! Overall, The Awakening treads a lot on familiar grounds, but there is true talent in front and behind the camera that you can really appreciate the presentation. It could of used a couple more scares but the ones thrown at us were effectively spooky. The acting, characters, suspense and surprising twist though, truly drive this film. Recommended! 7.9 out of 10",The Awakening
68,sjarja,Flawed but still enjoyable,7,3 August 2017,"I love the atmosphere and mood of that movie. It is this kind of tranquil, yet suspenseful early 20th century (but in terms of general atmosphere - rather late 19th century) way. It is not as busy as modern times, nor as tech-focused. Things .... takes longer - and a lot of un-explainable stuff - remains a mystery.The protagonist, a very modern, assertive and educated woman, disproves the supernatural.. and from that very stereotypical beginning - it is very obvious .. that she will be kind of ""redeemed"" by the end of the movie. She will realize that there IS the supernatural.The movie is her process of realizing this ... and i do not quite agree with this progress much. The story starts similar to an investigative movie. She uses devices that are meant to catch the fraud (or the supernatural), she investigates the people around her and all. But foremost ... she did not even want to investigate the site - and i did not quite understand the reason WHY she decided to do it anyway. This decision aside - the investigative part is handled in a rather rushed way. She falls victim to kind of typical horror movie tropes. Her emotions completely blind her rational thinking.Also - and i am absolutely unsure why that is.... for a school that large at that time ... there only seem to be what ... 2 teachers? - Where are all the adults in that school. There is a severe lack of people to talk to - to gain a more objective insight - and she does not even try to gain sufficient information about the few ones that ARE there.So the investigative part of the movie is severely lacking and unsatisfying.Then there is the supernatural part - where she gets overwhelmed by - sadly - there is no better term .... - by jump scares. Many of those are only there for the audience, not even for her (cause there is no way she would have seen them)Her mental progression is a bit too quick for my taste and not quite justified - because at that time - the audience knows way too little about her history. So objectively - she just turns from a rational researcher and fervent denier of the supernatural - to an emotional wreck ... fully believing in the supernatural. - a bit mehh.... .The conclusion is not stereotypical - and i would not even call it bitter-sweet - but rather ... tragic. BUI - it, too .. is insufficiently explained - not to mention that the idea of completely forgetting such a memory is more a trope of cheap ""tele-novelas"" with their tendency of amnesia. I only saw the movie once - so i am not aware if there were possibly character interaction plot-holes present .. but i give it the benefit of the doubt. Most of those problems are rather minor though for the movie IS enjoyable. The visuals are very nice - and the acting is - for the most part ... alright (a bit overacted for my taste here and there...)",The Awakening
69,JamesIan2021,Chilling,5,3 May 2015,"There's plenty of bumps and jumps on offer in this chilling British horror flick that stands as tall as The Woman In Black and The Others. Like those two movies, The Awakening (awesome title) boasts a spectacular and equally mind blowing twist end that will stay on your mind, and the other two twists will leave you shivering and feeling cold when they reveal themselves. I think any film that leaves a lasting impression whether it be the whole way through or just at the end is an effective one. It's an intriguing horror movie that despite a few lousy boo scares and inconsistency with tension, it's nicely shot, packed with great performances, especially Rebecca Hall and pays off with a marvellous ending that will satisfy viewers.",The Awakening
70,unclet-30169,Pile of rubbish,3,26 July 2020,"This is NOT a haunting like it leads you to believe, it's more about psychosis. It really goes off the rails in the third act and some of the elements of the story were completely at odds with what the movie was trying to portray. Frustrating.",The Awakening
71,culmo80,"The Second ""Twist"" Could have been better",6,14 July 2012,"I really enjoyed this movie from the start through the finish despite the first twist. The atmosphere is fantastic, from the opening scene onwards, there is a certain air to it that has you just waiting for something to jump out at you, without it being hokey. I loved the main setting, of an old English estate house turned into a private boarding school. I thought the acting was great and I thought the film overall was very nicely done.Spoilers Below:I found the second twist, that she actually lived in that house and witnessed her father murder her mother and half-brother, to be a bit of a stretch. While it is certainly possible for a person to block out some memories, I find it very unlikely that anyone could block out their entire childhood and have no recollection upon seeing the house they grew up in. As to the first twist, that Jonathan was a ghost, I found it clever. Sure, its been done before, but what hasn't? I think they did a nice job of keeping that a twist by having not one, but two people conversing with the ghost.The third ""twist"" if that's what it was, was interesting...you didn't know whether she died or not until almost the very end.As for other parts...I felt the antagonism with the gardener/driver was an element of the plot that was unnecessary. Either more should have been done with that or it should have been cut. Also, the sex scene was a little absurd. This woman just had the scare of her life...so she goes with the guy to develop the film and when they see the ghost, she suddenly gets the urge and they have sex? If they wanted to keep that in, they could have moved it to earlier in the film, but it felt odd where they have it. Anyway, this was a good film and if you like horror movies, this is one you should watch. It's not the best horror out there, but it is certainly better than most of the current crop of what is being marketed as horror; there are no cheap gimmicks or ""shock'em with gore and blood"" techniques here.",The Awakening
72,caiged,A semi spooky tale that is low on scares,4,10 September 2012,"There are few scares in this movie, and while one or two are genuinely spooky most are not gasp inducing. Setting this movie post WWI did not help, as did the condescending demeanor of Florence Cathcart, the skeptical ghost hunter. Or at least the setting would have worked if Cathcart had been more of a believer. The boarding school set certainly offered plenty of opportunities for some genuine chills and spooks but the director failed to make effective use of the various levels and dark corridors.Like all ghost tales this movie has a twist, which is interesting but because it's been done by other movies like The Others and the Sixth Sense, it's not all that awe inspiring. There's lots of flat moments in the movie that leaves you glancing at your watch and wondering when the next scare was coming.The acting is nothing worth raving about. Hall's Florence Cathcart is so disdainful that it's hard at times to feel sorry for her life or what she's been through and it's more of a relief when the story isn't focused on her. Dominic West's character is weird and unsettled, and a very odd choice as a teacher in a boarding school.A disappointing effort for what should have been a bone chilling experience. I don't recommend this one.",The Awakening
73,rioplaydrum,A sophisticated ghost story,8,1 December 2015,"As I picked through the DVD's at my local library, I came across The Awakening as an after thought.Another ghost story, I thought to myself. Sure. Why not? I really didn't expect much beyond the above board cookie-cutter production out of Hollywood with some decent thrills and chills and a nice neat little ending.How delightfully wrong I was.Set in London in 1921, Rebecca Hall portrays the indelible Ms Catheart. Florence Catheart is a rarity in her time. She's unmarried, educated, an author, and has a successful career as a debunker of the supernatural. She delights in busting charlatans and frauds much the same as the Amazing James Randi does in our own time.Shortly after a successful raid on a séance hosted by prominent citizens in London, Florence is paid a visit by a Mr. Mallory (Dominic West) requesting her services at the Rockford School for Boys in the countryside. They evidently have a ghost. Florence reluctantly takes the job.The school itself is a large, multi-floored structure that years before was the private home of a very rich family. And a little boy is rumored to have been killed inside, but no official record exists as the wealthy can afford to bury their secrets. Florence's sometimes erratic behavior belies the fact she has her own secrets buried deep within her own heart. But neither will stay buried forever.Florence sets up camp inside with her assembly of turn-of-the-century scientific equipment and trap cameras, and the mysteries begin to unfold at a satisfying pace.All the sets, costumes and props are authentic (but I doubt the existence of mechanical talking dolls in the early 1900's). The film itself, although shot in color, has a slight hue of sepia to it that adds to it's illusion of looking back in time. Side plots and character development abound, and tie in quite nicely around the main story. Twists and turns throughout the story are well constructed and provide many a surprise. Strap yourself into your easy chair with your favorite hot beverage, turn the lights off and enjoy!The Awakening is guaranteed not to put you to sleep.",The Awakening

I'm not sure the two leads were the best choices for the film but you are drawn into it so quickly that it makes no further difference. But the character actors were beyond excellent, especially the matron. I was fully anticipating some kind of resolution of her love and devotion for her boyfriend, apparently killed in WW1. Then, the scenes of her and her family threw me completely off and I wonder if they were even needed at all to tell the story. The last 30 minutes are just heartbreaking while the last 5 minutes are completely superfluous to the story.

I am admittedly repeating criticisms I have read of the film, but with which I heartily agree.Beautifully photographed with sumptuous settings in fine old country houses, strong performances from the heart-stoppingly beautiful Rebecca Hall and the manly Dominic West, just don't save this film from being convoluted, contrived, uninvolving and ultimately dull. I watched this film through to the end only because it took me half way through to realise that I could have saved about an hour and a half of my life not watching it at all but felt that I had to persevere - possibly so I could write this critique?I kept on thinking of classical ghost-story writer MR James and longed for his tighter, more mysterious and far more menacing dramatising of the supernatural - which is a skill which seems to elude most modern screenwriters, including for this film.One thing I will admit was that, although the film was less than the sum of its parts, it did have an atmosphere about it which lingered.In case you are interested, MR James said towards the end of his life that he did believe in ghosts and hauntings but that 'we don't know the rules'.",The Awakening

She is assigned a job in which she goes to inspect a very large and creepy all boys school.It's not very scary and most of the jumps are very predictable, the plot line is original for the first half and then it gradually builds to a story that's not so fresh. It has several dry spots and scenes that drag on a bit too long and some pointless nudity that felt a little silly.What really makes me love this movie and would make me recommend it is the amazing soundtrack. Every score was incredible and was honestly better than any other part of the film. Along with the incredible soundtrack was the attention to vintage detail on every shot, every thing about the movie felt very authentic to its 1920s feel. The acting was very well done and cinematography was excellent to where it alone became a striving point in my reason for wanting to watch it.It won't scare you or leave you frightened afterwards but it's a nice, fairly clean, spooky tale.",The Awakening
82,schak23,Very interesting and entertaining,9,30 July 2012,"This review does not only contain spoilers but also a personal reading of the film. The question, so what is happening in The Awakening, starts with identifying who actually is waking.1921. The film focuses on the loss of young men, the role of the men who are still there and how women act and react to them. Yes, it is a ghost story, yes it is full of Gothic features and yes, it has shockers. But still, it is more or less a reminder of what happened between men and women in that period with its legacy for our recent history and our present time.Let's assume that Judd stands for the father. His posture, the gun, his threatening. He has the madness of Florence's father and the power (gun) and he wants to kill women who try to withstand. If Florence's brother and her lover stand for the youth that was killed by mad cowards like her father and the weapon-crazy powers of Europe in WWI than it is Robert who stands for the men who have learned from the lessons of war. Throughout the story Robert shows suffering but he is also trying to cope, showing compassion and understanding and also love. He is the contrast of Judd and the father, but he is also close to those who died.In that respect I believe he is not a ghost, nor is Florence. They are both alive and have defeated the men who stood for the warmongers and killers of the hopeful youth. So, it might be a delight for feminist critics to see the ending of the film. She has a quick drag from a cigarette (always a sign for independence and nonconformity of women in film), has a relationship with a kind man and rushes off to the city for work. Another interesting figure definitely is Maud but she is tricky to understand. Just for the drama or is there more to her?A great film. The ending is somewhat rushed and the hints prior to it didn't really give a lot away to understand it straight away. But overall very good acting, setting, cinematography and story-telling with ambition to be more than just entertainment.",The Awakening
83,starsteamer,Ghostly,7,30 July 2012,"This is simply a badly publicised gem of a ghost story. Set after the Great War it deals with the time period exceptionally well. The setting of a beautiful but creepy grand mansion is fitting and the characters are superbly acted. The plot is enjoyable with some unexpected twists and turns to keep you on you toes. Arguably, however, it does lack originality and I found it hard to shake the idea that I had not seen it before. The characters are bordering on the stereotypical (creepy gardener anyone?) but this does not necessarily take away from the film itself. I would say that this was a very typically English ghost story with everything that comes with that. And it is better than the Woman in Black...",The Awakening
84,BornKnight,"A Suspense ghost story, in the early 20th century England",7,25 March 2012,"""The Awakening"" is a British thriller about a woman, Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) who reveals mysteries about ghosts and false seers who have connections with them, in theory, and that is called by a teacher (Dominic West) to reveal the mystery of the appearance or hoax, of a ghost in an internship in the fields of rural England, in 1921 post WWI.The movie is pretty solid and with good performances by all artists, having a small cast, but very talented in every way. The musical score and sound it is also very well done and fits the movie perfectly.Basically all the scenarios for the story goes on in this house (which is the Manderston House in Berwickshire, Scotland), the other being in some part of London at the beginning of the film.The movie for me categorize as a Thriller more than Horror, since 90% is composed of this genre: you do not observe blood abuse in the sequences (except where it really fits the story) or many special effects, which are few and also fit in history.The mood of loneliness, austerity and suspense is very well represented in the scenarios and mood of the house, who is adapted to the story. Moreover, the film highlights the emotional side of virtually all the major characters that have depth, something that many current films of the genre hasn't.The movie actually ends up remembering many other films that deal with similar themes, like ""The Orphanage"" (2007) and ""The Others"" (2001), however it is good as the ones mentioned (altrough not so good as them), having a well developed story and plot.The only negative point, maybe, is the end of the unfolding story (which I do not mention for being a spoiler, and to leave it to the discretion of those who will watch the film), which is kind of dubious, purposefully, and can be interpreted into two ways, in addition to tying the protagonist of a weird way to the main plot.In the end, is a very good thriller-horror movie in the early twentieth century, and highly recommended to all, but for those people who like concise endings, since this is broader, and who like movies with more action. My score: 7,5 / 10.0.",The Awakening

What a shame that would have been! There are always plenty of long reviews, so I won't bore you with mine.This movie was absolutely wonderful. It has some drama, suspenseful music and scenes from start to finish, and even a bit of romance (but not nearly enough to make this a romantic or ""chick"" movie).Each of the chosen actors were perfect for their part and they portrayed assigned characters beautifully. They were very likable and believable.I'm not going to compare this movie with any other, but if you're like me and love movies such as The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island, Inception, Dream House, etc... I promise you will love this movie as well.

87,klheintz,Not a good twist,4,5 November 2016,"The Awakening isn't a terrible movie. It's just a lot of what you've seen before with nothing really crazy thrown in. It's hardly a horror film in my opinion. There's no feeling of danger for the characters in relation to the supernatural, it's almost only some jump scares and that's about it.What the movie does right is the casting. There wasn't any cringe- worthy performances, they were all pretty good. They also kept the cast to a few people so there wasn't an abundance of characters to keep track of. It kept the story pretty simple.I did like the editing and look of the film a lot. But other than that, it kind of fell flat in regards to the story. The twist at the end wasn't very cool even though it is one of the more original twists I've seen. There's a lot of hints earlier in the film that you can try to catch but it is all spelled out for you in the end and kind of ruins the re-watchability.Overall it's not a terrible movie. Just suffers from a weird ending that doesn't exactly know what to do once it starts to wrap up and it just drags on for way too long.",The Awakening

I always enjoy jumping ahead of an intricate story through the nuances of the characters and peripheral details, but that is not the path this film takes you on. The cinematography is perfectly paced. You nearly miss it's genius until you realize how well it's served the story by becoming the eye of the viewer.The film is a treasure of originality.

92,Cinemafou,What I Want From Such a Film,2,24 July 2013,"One thing that I noticed about this film was the similarity to House of Voices. Young woman goes to huge old mansion in the country that is being used as a boys' school, discovers bizarre goings on while her personal history comes into play. Nothing wrong with this, indeed it could be made into something truly frightening. And both films benefit from high production values with effective lighting and photography and a very good cast.Then there is the script and the overall story board. Subtle revealing of a supernatural presence initially works well, but then, at least for me, things start to fall apart. The protagonist becomes less convincing as time goes on, seeming to be a different person than the one first introduced. Certain scenes are thrown in that contribute nothing to the story and indeed just muck it up, other scenes seem like outtakes where they were just experimenting with camera angles, even some characters and their actions are superfluous, and the revelation at the end really annoyed me - I have seen this same revelation many times before in other films and it is tiresome in the extreme.

94,jeanbal,A masterpiece in new Gothic genre,9,6 August 2012,"Hammer films have long ruled the Gothic horror genre and have set standards that are still very much respected today. The ""Lady in Black"" movie is a perfect example of the way modern cinematographers can adapt - with some success - the ""looks of the past"" to meet the expectations of the audience of 2012. But, for me, ""The Awakening"" goes much further. Every ingredient of the Gothic genre ""look"" is there: foreboding set, washed up greenish picture, ghosts, shadows of Romanticism, moodish music... everything. But there is also a real ""cleverness"" that we don't often see in this type of film. The overall photograph is stunning, but in a very subdued way, each shot is perfectly composed to convey a certain feeling. Players, for their parts, relie generally on very subtle acting techniques, which gives more impact to the most climatic emotional scenes. And, finally, the plot is quite intriguing, but nevertheless is essentially just an excuse to dive in a strange and traumatized universe: the English upper society just recovering from the mass slaughters of WWI. Ghosts are not much compared to the battles of the Somme or Verdun. And the real message of this very beautiful and moving film seems to be that the ghosts created by human evil are much more terrifying than those of the ""other world"". And I can't finish this review without expressing my admiration for the admirable work done by Rebecca Hall (a great actress promised to accomplish greater things), Daniel Pemberton (whose musical score is simply gorgeous) and - of course - Nick Murphy, a very promising new director. If you like intelligence in your movies, give a chance to ""The Awakening"".",The Awakening

96,markgordonpalmer,The Best Heart-Thumping Haunted House Movie In Ages!,10,27 October 2011,"{MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW}BFI London Film Festival Screening: 26/10/2011The Awakening is a film that's hard to talk too much about.There are many plot twists, sudden turns and sheer shocks throughout. There is one twist involving a boy's death, locked outside the school, that seems to end the film in its tracks prematurely–a smart sleight of hand. Rebecca Hall plays Florence Cathcart; a fake spook exposer in a shell-shocked England, post-First World War, the year 1921-a time of sickness; both post-shock of the horrors of the battlefield and post-epidemics. It's not surprising that many are turning to mediums to find their lost loved ones. Florence helpfully exposes all the trickery, but – in an effective and original opening scene – this exposure isn't welcomed even by those who are being tricked.Some spirits however are undoubtedly real. Florence receives a visit from the handsome, if haunted (of looks and of house and home), Robert Mallory; a teacher at a private boarding school for boys in the country. Dominic West is perfect as Mallory; a charismatic and withdrawn 'little boy lost' performance. Part-dashing, part-Dashwood. Like those who are reeling across the country from the loss of loved ones, the boys at his school are equally lost and lonely. They are, well - as good as orphans, despite being collected during the holidays by their parents. All except for one poor lad whose parents are unable to collect him as the journey is too far. So, during the school holidays, it's just him in the house, along with the fussing, furrow-browed matron (Imelda Staunton in a fabulous portrayal of malevolence and love – you never really know which)- and Mr Mallory.The lost and lonely schoolboy is played by Isaac Hempstead Wright, who really is outstanding in conveying quiet uncertainty. You just want to give him a big hug at times. But with so many things going bump in the night around him, he probably wouldn't believe any words of comfort, other than - ""run!"" Like the grown up roll call around them, all the young cast of schoolboys are excellent – less Harry Potter, more Harry House of Horror. Writer Stephen Volk (who co-wrote the screenplay with director Nick Murphy) is no stranger to sorting fact from fiction, or rather blurring the lines. Volk was also the writer of the BBC's 'is this actually real?' live Halloween chiller,'Ghostwatch'.The screenplay and story of 'The Awakening' is blisteringly scary; I mean really, really scary, helped along by the character of a scary old groundsman called Judd, played by a scene-stealingly creepy and sly Joseph Mawle. Throughout the movie, you know that something is up with Judd – he walks around with a shotgun and has a haunted look to his eyes; like it wouldn't matter at all if he actually pulled that trigger. Towards the end of the movie, he looks through a window and gets the shock – or thrill – of his life.A couple of the 'jumps' made me tingle for a good minute or so - a kind of frightened buzz that didn't fade away for a good while: a sheer orgasm of fear. Director Nick Murphy (bolstered by sublime work from cinematographer Eduard Grau) shoots and saturates the movie in cold, heartless, dead-tinted hues and handles the shock bits very well – often brilliantly. The film is shot in colour, but in bright early morning blues and greys, so the feel of the film is like being in an old black and white photograph from, well – 1921. Rebecca Hall is astoundingly beautiful and enticing as Florence, even when sifting through the most bizarre spook-detecting gadgets and devices, or running through the houses of fake mediums exposing the lies like a well-to-do Lady Sherlock Holmes. Florence has her own agenda for trying to expose fake mediums and ghost sightings; having lost her parents in a tragic accident - anger understandably burns away inside her when she confronts those who offer false hope. Florence knows there's a missing part to the puzzle she certainly won't (unlike some of those poor souls also searching for the dead out there) find in the fakes. Like all the best actresses, for all the best directors – the leading lady is shot with love; Rebecca Hall's face and body framed against stark backgrounds in full, leering (but never tacky or forced – only natural)close-ups. Sometimes the camera veering so far towards the actress's freckled face and full, bee stung lips that it's almost like we are looming in for the kiss; reminding of how directors such as Polanski framed their pouting, ravishing best stars such as Nastassja Kinski in films such as 'Tess'.The beauty of The Awakening rests in the fact that, during the end credits, you feel like you have understood something further about the spirit world – I felt quite tearful, not because I was scared. Which I had been. Or because the film was an outstanding ghost story and will be seen as a classic of the genre for many years to come. Which it will be. I'm not sure what aspect of the movie affected me so deeply. The film does have an upsetting yet beautiful plot twist towards the end that plays with ideas of good and bad, real and unreal, life and afterlife – in a way that few ghost stories have managed before; that only the work of such masters of the craft as M.R.James can capture. But I think the way I felt went beyond this – in the same way films such as The Exorcist or The Omen are said to have tapped into real evil, I think The Awakening taps into something a little too real as well. But like ghost investigator Florence Cathcart, I have no idea – yet – what that reality is. Like others in this movie; I don't think I'd be telling anyway.",The Awakening
97,lucyrichards27,A very saddening but jumpy movie,7,28 March 2012,"When I first started watching this movie I thought it was going to be as scary as 'The woman in Black', but it made me jump more than physically frighten me. The characters and relationships between the characters was extremely effective, specifically the one between Florence and Tom, the child. It is a very sad movie with twists and turns along the way; a grown-up ghost story. I wouldn't recommend that you watch it on your own! To me there could've been more scares, but apart from that, I have no other criticisms whatsoever.

98,hugomelo600,"Gorgeous cinematography, muddled plot.",5,7 May 2012,"I love old-fashioned ghost stories, both in literature and in moving picture. It's a harder genre than people give credit to, especially because it's age. Since it has been done to death, almost every possibility and approach seems to have been covered. However, there are movies that have taken the this tired formula and made splendid films - The Orphanage is a good example of a ghost story done right. The Awakening started off right. The acting was good, the mood was efficiently set and the cinematography gorgeous to look at. I was many times at absolute awe at the beautiful images and camera shots that the movie boosted. However, the central thing in a movie is it's plot, and that's where things get shaky. The plot wasn't that great to begin with and as it progressed became less interesting, managing nonetheless to sustain my interest throughout until the end, which was by far the film's greatest weakness. The ending ""twist"" came too late and was done with too much haste, which hurt it's already shaky believability. I think the ending despite being far-fetched could still work if done more competently and with more preparation. It's still an enjoyable movie, but the beautiful and eerie imagery would be much better served by a better plot. All in all, a solid 5 for the film, 10 for the cinematography. This cinematographer deserves to be well known, assuming he isn't already.",The Awakening
99,eddiesterling-82248,Thoroughly enjoyable ghost story,9,3 January 2018,"I have just watched this film and, after many trials, I feel I have found a decent ghost story with a satisfying denouement - in among all the pap out there at the moment. Bucking the trend (a la the dreadful re-working of Robert Wise's The Haunting) special effects are kept to a minimum, allowing the characters - especially the exquisite Rebecca Hall - to shine through. A hint of 'The Turn of the Screw' at times, but that is no bad thing.",The Awakening
100,Jorgescarlisle,"Great acting, lousy movie.",4,11 January 2012,"Each of the performers in this film really manage to carry the viewer to the fine nuances of the emotional conflict of the characters.Beyond that, there is little of value in this film.As a thriller it really doesn't quite make it. A recently deceased chicken has more unexpected jumps than does this plot line. The film did manage to wrench one minor jump out of me (after three quarters of an hour of waiting for it,) giving me some minor hope that the story could still be saved. Don't be fooled, that's it. A couple other scenes do manage to get that goose-flesh started, but it's far too little to make up for the rest of the film.There were also a couple shots I can only assume were intended to inspire that horror movie jump, but instead only managed to deliver a confusing visual spiccato effect.The storyline starts out well, defining the heroine as a strong logical woman. Unfortunately, as the story develops the character is revealed to instead be weak, stupid, emotionally unstable, and prone to having sex with men she barely knows for no reason at all. In toto, this gives the impression that the authors Volk and Murphy believe the idea of a strong woman is a myth and suggests the two may harbor misogynistic tendencies rivaling that of Piccasso.The sex scene comes off as a contrivance to bolster the ratings. Why do these characters suddenly have sex? There is minimal suggestion of any physical attraction between the two, and the act itself is preceded neither by flirtation nor any suggestion by either character that they were physically interested in each other. They just suddenly jumped into bed.Granted, the storyline did incorporate a couple of romantic style scenes. (Please note the term style. These scenes were not actually romantic in any way.) Far too much of the film was wasted as a buildup for the romantic plateau, which leaves the viewer wondering if they're watching a horror movie or a romance. I felt it failed miserably in both genres.In short, I didn't buy it. I recommend you don't either.",The Awakening
101,robin-72-718219,An Instant Classic Ghost Story,8,2 February 2013,"I found ""The Awakening"" to be a breath of fresh air for the Horror/Suspense genre. With so many shaky cam, found footage, reality show type horror/suspense movies hitting the box offices and living rooms around the world with poor character development, over the top torture and gore, plots so thin they are the only transparent ghosts in the picture. ""The Awakening"" is bound to be an instant classic! It's done with just the right amount of restraint, it has a rather Hitchcockian tone to it.What you don't see is far more suspenseful and adds to it.Sometimes less really is more. There is a fine line to walk especially with a ghost story, to achieve that sense of spine tingling, skin crawling feeling and that element can only be teased from the psyche with mystery, not in your face guts or a head being lopped off - that is shock value and gross out, which is perfectly fine for a slasher pic or a grind house movie, but not a good ghost story. ""The Awakening"" is set in 1921 England, our Protagonist Florence Cathcart a free thinking, strong willed ghost buster, author and hoax crusher opens this gem of a movie by diving right into the fray. Mediums, psychics and séances' were all the rage during that time period, which began with the religion of spiritualism. Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in the 1840's to the 1920's. With many patrons from the Aristocratic and famous class, like Abraham Lincoln joining his wife for a séance after the death of their young son. After WWI many bereaved souls were searching for a connection to loved ones lost either from deadly illness or the horrors of war and were further victimized by unscrupulous charlatans seeking only coin and selling false hope. Florence's main objective is to put a stop to this and shed light and truth on the subject of death, the afterlife and ghosts. But after being invited to a supposedly haunted old grand estate that was converted into a boy's boarding school, with a recent death of a student and a rumor of an old murder and sightings of a ghost, Florence finds much more than school boy pranks and hoaxes - she finds something good, something frightening and something truly enlightening. The character development in ""The Awakening"" is done perfectly with solid performances from the entire cast. The cinematography is excellent as is the entire production tip to tail. From sets and wardrobe to the musical score. The research done for the story and time period is what really brings this ghost story to life. It's the small details and creepy little surprises that all add to the reality of the time this story is told and the ensuing mystery. I must also comment on the pacing - this movie wasted no time, it's no action packed, a scare a minute kind of movie, it's far more subtle, but it's never slow or boring and nothing is wasted. As a true horror/suspense connoisseur (I have a degree in film production and I was a make-up artist/Stylist for print, film and T.V. for 12 years.) I'd like to comment on some of the cynical and negative reviews. One cannot simply lump all horror and suspense films together. There are many subsets of the genre (Slasher, Grind House, Mystery, Supernatural, Creature, Occult, Gothic..etc.)and each has it's own flavor so to speak. You cannot compare a movie like ""A nightmare on Elm street"" to ""The Changeling"". Though they are both considered to be horror, one is supernatural slasher and the other is classic ghost story. Even when comparing movies in the same subset like ""The house on haunted hill"" with ""The Haunting"" both of which have remakes, have huge differences, usually found in the details and presentation and should be considered unique in their own right. While it may be true that there is nothing new under the sun and we've all seen the same plots and themes over and over again - I have found there is always something new to add to the age old themes.This movie is in my top 10 of great ghost stories - 8 out of 10 stars for ""The Awakening"".",The Awakening
102,rosscosjunk,That was just daft,3,8 January 2012,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS (BUT THEY WONT BE AS BAD AS THE END OF THIS FILM).I'm sorry, that was just silly. I can't really explain to you here why it was silly due to spoilers, which seems like such an injustice to you as your probably just interested in whether or not the movie is worth watching and therefore my answer, in short, would have to be, not really.Suffice it to say, have you ever read a book that ends with ""it never happened"" at all? No? The reason why you haven't is because that premise for a story would probably be totally unacceptable to you. What would have been the point of reading the book and investing your time in the Characters anyway? That's been done before AND better (I recalled in particular Sixth Sense... or even Unbreakable?) and while the approached to that ""twist"" was subtle and spectacular in a way, this movie attempts it like a bolting horse and carriage with the wedding bride still clinging to the back of it for dear life (and yes... YOU are expected in the Church on time).Whats worse is that within 10 seconds of her arrival at the school, I was saying to myself ""my god...

What can I say about this movie, it has the right touch of creepiness but hidden revealed of beauty and yet troubling horror mixed with true friendship and love. What I love about this tale is how well it's set up, down to the costumes, the environment. You'll notice how the film looks like it's black and white in itself , as if its straight from history , from the 1921 which the film is set in. I love the music of the time, the history, the clothes, even the way of speaking.The ending was the best, but I was confused, I had many suspects in the film of the who the ghost was. I don't think it explained much about Walter or his back story enough. If you love surprises , especially at the end, you should see this! It has a few jumps and scares, but the true scary part of this film is the thought of death and were we all go. The beautiful score, the sets, all that will scare you more than anything else. I lost my mother , so this movie really touches my heart, especially since she died a year after this film came out. I give this film a 9 out of 10 only because it was a bit confusing, but maybe that's because I need to re watch it :) great master piece of a film.

Ghosts in the movie is not something frightening you , but rather they are alter egos of all. Ms. Florence's fight is not an exception. She denies her trauma using amnesia but finally she gets back to reality by help of a real ghost.

But further down the line the old cliché of finding the real deal, woah didn't see that coming. Anyways whats more ridiculous is the mild nudity and scenes of affection as there doesn't still seem to be that kind of a chemistry. Secondly at one point in time when the whole mystery is solved then there's this ridiculous flash back of a forgotten childhood yada yada yada.

But this is different, this film is short and sweet. A great movie to watch while at home with a significant other to simply enjoy the eerie atmosphere this film does a great job at depicting. A film with an interesting turn of events, I love the story line of woman ghost hunter who is out to prove that ghosts simply does not exist.

110,richard-2227,Muddled plot; patchy cinematography,5,7 March 2013,"I was intrigued by this story. The acting was terrific from first rate talent. But this film just ejected me about two thirds through because of the plot. I just hate it when films do this: it's called top heavy production. Like an iceberg with too much weight above the waterline it always flips on the viewer during playback. If you don't have the SCRIPT, don't ROLL CAMERA. You need a decent script to give your story ballast.In this case you have an implausible memory block from the heroine--returning to the scene of her childhood with no memory of having lived there before. I mean, having her return from a previous life would have been more plausible.Once the reveal was botched then the rest of this movie was like peddling a bicycle with the chain off. (Camera also fluffed some key shots early in the movie but I forgave them for this.) Where are the screenwriters?

I point to the fact that her sublime transformation from snooty, know-it-all bitch with a huge monkey on her back(we will learn about that later)to simply a frightened child perplexed and nervous of everything. That transformation, we will learn, is the key to the story. Others have noted her change from a scrawny, plain Jane man hater to a seductive and slightly sexy vixen. I was wondering if it was the same girl!

I'm 35 for Christ sake, not 80.This movie started out great; everything was going good. It had a certain direction, and I was eager to see where it would lead. Then about midway through everything is flushed down the crapper. This is well before the twist at the end too, which itself was utter crap.

113,admiral_andrews,A thriller of unsuspecting beauty,8,18 April 2012,"I've been waiting for months for a chance to see this movie, and when you wait for something this much, you run the risk of being let down.That's certainly not the case of Rebecca Hall's ""The Awakening"".I didn't go into this expecting a horror movie and I advise you to do the same, since this is for the most part a movie about personal ghosts and hidden secrets.Regardless of that, ""The Awakening"" does deliver in terms of frights, as it contains a lot of moments of high tension and surprise. It's one of those movies where you're not exactly shocked but kept on your toes to the point where you're afraid of what's hidden behind the next closed door.And ""The Awakening"" achieves this with some tricks and deceptions, but a pleasant lack of clichés. Some of its elements are indeed quite interesting in a ""reality within a reality"" kind of way you'll understand once you see it.But what I like about the movie the most is that it just doesn't resort to the usual rainy night and thunderstorm to increase the fright level. No. Amazingly for a movie of this type, ""The Awakening"" features beautiful scenarios and splendid photography and sound editing. In other words, it has class, and taking into account all the beautiful landscapes, all the more cruel it becomes that such strange events are going on. To the viewer, I suppose this means you'll find yourself spooked in situations where you wouldn't expect anything bad to happen in a regular movie.So, I would say that if you want a thriller that surprises you and offers the kind of filming you'd expect from a high level drama or historical novel, you really should check this movie out and enjoy it. This one will make you think and wonder. You won't get that often in movies these days.",The Awakening

119,fabiopb,Not Guillermo del Toro,4,15 April 2012,"Usually I don't leave reviews but since I noticed some reviewers comparing this movie to El Orfanato or El Espinazo del Diablo I decided to comment.Comparing The Awakening to El Espinazo is like comparing Scream to The Shining. El Espinazo is poetry in form of movie disguised as horror tale. It's a piece of art that has several layers and is told with incredible sensibility despite the harshness of the setting. The Awakening is yet another silly ghost story. It has fewer than average cheap scares, which is kinda of a plus, but the story is paper thin, silly and ultimately unrewarding.Another thing that bothered me a lot is that the personalities and the behavior of the characters are absolutely modern. In fact, one could easily set this movie in 2020 by changing only the clothes and objects and leaving all acting untouched. The acting is not bat but it is ridiculous to imagine that people like my great-grandparents would talk and behave anything like that. So expect an extremely superfluous post-first-war feeling.If you're looking for an intelligent ghost story go for El Espinazo del Diablo. El Orfanato is also worth checking. But I definitely do not recommend The Awakening.",The Awakening

Most horror films are remake of previous films, or at least made out from an idea of those films. But it is a unique as well as twisting one. The horror tactics were genuine and scary.

To me it seemed to be overdone in terms of emotions, somehow unrealistic. I can't say that plot is somehow original either. The whole idea was initially good, I liked the beginning, but there was something missing, something that would tie everything together. What was the role of a man walking around with a hunting gun? Was it necessary for the whole idea? What about the leg and knife scene? I didn't understand this. The love story emerged unbelievably. Regarding some technical aspects - picture was grainy, I can't find it original. Do not know was it purpose of the camera man, seemed like an old camera was use with low tolerance for low light.

This movie is different, it's not focused on the horror or the scare, it's focused on the story of Florence Cathcart (played by the fantastic Rebecca Hall) and her drive to prove that spirits are not real and are just 'naughty little troublemakers'. However, she is not really trying to prove spirits aren't real, she's actually looking for a sign that they are real, and her dead, nearly-fiancée has passed over.It is a really good movie, with a great story, great acting and a great big twist at the end. For some people this movie drags on too much and a lot of it doesn't matter in the end. For me, I loved every second of the story, and the ending was just superb. The twist, when it is revealed, really will make you go 'wait, what?' and I think the movie is worth watching just for the twist.As I said in the summary, do not go to see this if you're wanting a scary horror movie, or a horror movie really, go watch it for the fantastic storyline and superb acting by all involved.",The Awakening

136,deejypoo,Howler alert,8,5 August 2019,"The boarding school would have been in Cumberland, as Cumbria as stated in the film wasn't formed until 1974.
No railway line in the Lake District runs that far alongside a Lake, and the engine a Class 5 built in 1934 pulling Maroon coaches a livery not applied until the late 50's early 60's- do not belong in story of 1921. Otherwise, an enjoyable experience.",The Awakening

138,Mini-Matador,"Means well, but is ultimately a flawed jumbled mess.",4,5 October 2011,"Just a quick review on the film as I have to run out for some lunch, I got to watch a copy of this at work, I knew nothing about the plot or who starred in it and made it, which I consider one of the best way to appreciate films. It follows a young ghost hunter in post WWI England who gets hired to investigate strange occurrences in a boys boarding school. I won't go into detail over plot, all I'll say is that it walks the line between predictability and innovation, unfortunately treading mainly on territory we've seen before with much more impact (The Orphanage springs to mind). By the end of the film the plot is such a tangled mess covered with plot holes, if I didn't have to watch it for work I'd have walked out. Dominic West provides a few unintentional laughs at the start but luckily improves as the film goes on, Rebecca Hall works pretty well as the cynic who starts to doubt her scientific beliefs, but overall I'd say the supporting cast were stronger than either of the leads with Imelsa Staunton up to her usual standard. The script is a mess and in dire need of a re-write, the second half in particular, and while the directing seems adequate, it is ultimately flat and boring. I wasn't scared, psychologically or otherwise, at any point in the film. I give it a 4 out of ten for effort, production values were nice, the building they used was a great location, but ultimately it loses its self in all its twists and turns, which I could follow, but we're clichéd and tired, leaving this viewer unengaged and ultimately unimpressed. A wasted opportunity.",The Awakening
139,edwyyn,Second-hand goods,5,15 July 2021,"I am not very clued-up about movies, and haven't seen most of the films referred to by other reviewers here. But from my perspective, this is largely a version of The Turn of the Screw, with all the ingredients - a neurotic heroine deeply in love with a man she has just met, a large old house with children under ghostly influences, a middle-aged housekeeper full of foreboding who knows more than she is telling, a brutal gamekeeper, and a final confrontation between the heroine and a boy ending in death. And the thing seems to abound with cliches common to supernatural movies - a young woman with big eyes walking around endlessly, staring at everything, a ball bouncing downstairs - and where have I already heard the line, 'There are no children here - just us.'With all this, entertaining enough - though so many lines were mumbled or submerged in musak, making the already complex pay-off difficult to read. I enjoyed it (slightly), and loved the period visuals, but won't watch it again.",The Awakening
140,nick-ablitt-613-23820,Rubbish,1,17 March 2012,"How can anyone rate this movie above 0 ? It may as well be aliens that ""did it"" in the end as you have no idea how the ending is going to be by watching the first hour or so, and I mean that in a kind way, rubbish utter, rubbish, any good work in the hour or so leading up to the end is pointless when the end comes crap. Unless of course you all watching the emperor's new clothing Shiite. Then maybe I miss the point, and should never watch this type of movie again and watch something like Scooby Doo instead. If a movie is crap say so, don't try and be a smart arse and say otherwise.Oh did I say, don't watch this, it's rubbish.",The Awakening
141,daaag-mar,Promising mid-start but a total waste of time. Wannabe good movie.,2,20 February 2017,"People review this movie good because they think it is so complicated. The movie is not to be understood, this is because things don't match up. People might give the movie a high rating because they don't fully understand the movie, but that's the writer's fault, cause it honestly has a plot that does not make sense. The story line is all over the place and illogical. Even when we are talking about the paranormal, the plot is still really illogical and unclear. The movie is lonely, tedious and has some nice shots that give you a sense of ambiance. But after all it is definitely not strong. Slim entertainment and no wisdom being acquired from this movie. If people are amazed by this movie they haven't seen much other good movies,I have seen plenty good movies and this 1 will get 2/3 stars.",The Awakening
142,robingood30,A mighty muddle. No ghost of a doubt about it!,2,6 December 2011,"I wonder that people might have considered themselves justified in comparing this to such gems in the ghost-movie genre as The Devil's Backbone, The Orphanage or the supremely accomplished The Others. Let me warn you that this poor effort by a little-known director has very little in common with them, apart from a few similarities in the plot. I think the main fault of this film is its muddled screenplay which gets frankly ridiculous at some points in the story. The acting is not very good either and the characters are unattractive and uninteresting. They're also superficially drawn. I was very bored throughout the film and was relieved when it ended. I'm a great fan of ghost movies but I really believe this film doesn't deserve to be even remembered. It's just a jumble of stilted clichés and the director should have made up his mind whether he wanted to make a ghost film or a melodrama with mildly erotic overtones (yes, there's even room for that!). Yet even Dominic West's firm buttocks displayed in one peephole scene won't save this film from disaster.VERY BORING, HARDLY SCARY AND MOSTLY UNORIGINAL.",The Awakening
143,e-m-rose-786-336463,"Gorgeous, tragic and atmospheric.",9,8 September 2013,"Perhaps I am a sucker for atmosphere-drenched period pieces, particularly when combined with a strong female lead and a solid Gothic ghost story, but The Awakening was eerie, heart- wrenching and ultimately very satisfying. It's gorgeous to look at, cast in the shadow of the Great War, and is now fixed as one of my all-time favorite films of the ghost story genre, right up there with The Others and El Orfanato, from which it is not dissimilar in setting or tone. I can't say much more without spoilers, but I do love Tom and he is played quite deftly by such a young actor. Everyone was marvelous in this, though, and the ending will turn you around more than once. Probably one of the best thrillers streaming on Netflix right now if you are looking for a fine story instead of a splatter film.",The Awakening
144,robertaohlinger,Gothic Horror,7,31 October 2013,"You have to come to this movie wanting the psychological tension of a Gothic horror novel. Begin with the strong female protagonist, add a remote location in a run-down mansion, isolation and malice - supernatural and real - and here's what you get: 1. The perfect antidote to romantic attraction for old family manors and boarding schools - Hogwarts its not, chilling and realistically depressing. It is not the type of place you want to spend the night. These are not people who inspire you with their ability. They are losers who end up teaching kids no one wants, in a manor house no one wants, in a cold gloomy place no one wants to go.2. The changing weather, with its pattern of darkening and lightening, is an element itself. The tensions of the novel is satisfying, as it allows you the fear of the first night, with its relief and revelations. To be honest, I thought I was watching Scooby Doo for a minute as all is revealed the next morning. But then it got darker. It's layered.3. There's a temporal and emotional setting which has to be appreciated to ""get"" this movie. It's after WWI, and the losses and regrets are imprinted on these survivors - survival of loss, survival of tragedy, survival from war, much guilt, probably some attachment disorder. Fear is its own character.4. Pacing becomes a problem in the middle of the movie, the story becomes really muddle and very hard to follow. Then it becomes easier to follow again.",The Awakening
145,dp-paige,Great storyline. Poor filming.,1,13 October 2014,"This is really a nice storyline, and I enjoyed the first several minutes of watching. Unfortunately this movie took too long and was very dragged out. The only parts after 30 minutes that were interesting were the two scenes in which the movie took a really awkward, unneeded, and ill-fully placed sexual turn. The acting was great, however. And the cinematography was beautiful and made me feel like it truly caught the feel of London back in the 1900's. Like I said, The Awakening has a superb storyline, and I truly thought it would be a good, scary and thrilling movie for me to watch on this lazy Monday holiday so I was extremely disappointed at the weird turn of events. I'm all for having sexuality in a movie, but only when appropriately placed. The woman started stimulating herself in a bathtub at a boy's boarding school after being frightened (which is really just not realistic whatsoever) and shows her boob for a split second, and after developing a photograph that shows a boy ghost, she gets all hot again and starts to have sex with the stiff, rigid Mr. Mallory. Very distasteful and really just plain weird.",The Awakening
146,purpleflower36,Beautiful Soundtrack and film,10,29 September 2013,"a life's bitter sweet and heartfelt tale.Watch 'the awakening', once finishing,you will want to explore its tale again.The musical score for this film is particularity stunning.One song i recommend is 'be still my soul, David Pemberton.The acting from all is exemplary. It is a film that stays with you and you want to revisit it to experience its highs and lows and its scary thrills also.Truly you should all enjoy this at least twice.Watch, watch it now ^_^",The Awakening
147,sfratini,Wonderful movie with convoluted ending,5,16 October 2021,This could have been a great movie but the ending is totally convoluted. There is a great build-up to the ending and then the viewer is disappointed. It is not clear if the main character is dead or not.,The Awakening
