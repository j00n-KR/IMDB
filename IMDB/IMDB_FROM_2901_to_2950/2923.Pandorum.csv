0,TheLittleSongbird,"Wasn't expecting much, but the film was much better than I expected",8,21 June 2011,"When I first heard of Pandorum, I was intrigued but to be honest I was not expecting much. The character development could have expanded perhaps in places, and Cam Gigandet overdoes it a tad, but Pandorum was much better than I expected. The story mayn't be the most original concept on the block, but it was intriguing, worked well and remained interesting. The script is credible enough, the music is atmospheric and there is a compelling atmosphere too. The direction is competent too, and the acting from the likes of Dennis Quaid is better than expected, but the real stars are the production values and special effects which are pretty much superb. All in all, far better than I'd hoped. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Pandorum
1,SnoopyStyle,Claustrophobic horror,6,8 March 2014,"In 2174, the Earth has reached a limit. It sent out a massive spacecraft carrying humans in cryo-sleep to a newly discovered planet. It's a sort of space ark. The crew of the spaceship later receives a message, ""You're all that's left of us."" Later still, Bower (Ben Foster) wakes up from his chamber to find the ship dark and desolate. He doesn't remember much. Then another person Payton (Dennis Quaid) wakes up. Slowly, the two discover a ship filled with terrifying secrets. Bower encounters people one after another. All of them on the run from the horrific creatures.This movie has atmosphere to spare. Its slow pace can feel tedious at times. It takes quite awhile to get started. Director Christian Alvart really needs to start this off much faster. It is a claustrophobic horror that is reminiscent of Alien. That's one of my favorite horror movie, and I appreciate the similarities. It looks good. It just needs a better and a more consistent pace. Antje Traue is the hot chick survivor. Cung Le doesn't speak any English. Norman Reedus gets a quick scene where he gets ripped apart. It's probably a mistake to separate Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid. And the paranoia exposition just confuses the movie. It would be a whole lot better to keep the story simple. The whole Pandorum idea is a mess, but I like how this movie ends.",Pandorum
2,Prismark10,The last hope of mankind,5,17 July 2018,"Paul W S Anderson is one of the producers so lower your expectations.By 2174 planet Earth is overpopulated and resources are scarce. has reached a limit. A giant spaceship has been constructed, a kind of ark sent out to deep space. The spacecraft Elysium is heading for planet Tanis which can sustain life.The crew are sent to hyper sleep for the long flight. Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) wakes up due to a malfunction in his pod. He is unsure where he is and suffers from amnesia. Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) also wakes up and discover that the ship's reactor is not working. Bower goes to fix it but realises that the ship has sinister secrets.As Bower goes through the dark passages he finds out that there are mutant cannibal figures, super strong lightning fast and out for flesh. Payton discovers that after the ship was launched, some of the crew went mad and regressed. Bower comes across some isolated survivors, members of the crew who have awoken and fighting to survive from the mutants. Pandorum has an incoherent story, it is a mess and borrows from other films. It has bits of Alien, Event Horizon, Sunshine, even Fight Club.A lot of the film takes place in the dark, it keeps the budget down. The mutants are there for jolts and make no sense. Humans do not mutate in hundreds of years and given their abilities, the mutants should have killed everyone in the ship by now.Despite the derivative feel of the film, Ben Foster keep the film going. It has enough action and mystery to be passably entertaining and I liked the ending.",Pandorum
3,claudio_carvalho,Has Potential to Become a Classic in the Future,8,15 May 2010,"In 2174, the natural resources of Earth are exhausted and the spacecraft Elysium is launched to the planet Tanis in the last hope of mankind. Due to the long travel, the crew-members are divided in teams that travel in extended hyper-sleep, rotating in shifts along the trip. When Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) from Flight Team 5 wakes up due to a malfunctioning of his chamber, he is disoriented and with amnesia. But sooner he realizes that the reactor is not working and provoking power surges in the ship. Then Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) also awakes and they find that they are locked in a room but the access door to the bridge is not reactivated. Bower moves through the ventilation trunk trying to open the door from outside. Sooner he discovers that there is some weird threatening life form in the ship and running is always the best option to survive. When he meets the biologist Nadia (Antje Traue) and the strong farmer Manh (Cung Le), they team up trying to reach the reactor and save their lives. Meanwhile, Payton rescues Corporal Gallo in the room, but the menace of the paranoid Pandorum psychological trauma seems to be affecting Gallo. ""Pandorum"" is a surprisingly great sci-fi with potential to become a classic in the future. The claustrophobic and complex story recalls ""The Descent"" in at least two scenes, but it is original and very well developed. The final twist is a great surprise and the advantage of the DVD is the facility the viewer has to repeat the explanation to fully understand the plot. The only imbecile scene is when Nadja holds Manh in the moment that he is going to kill a creature telling that the it is a child. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Pandorum""Note: On 13 April 2015, I saw this movie again.Note: On 24 January 2017, I saw this movie again.",Pandorum
4,kosmasp,Twist and shout,8,20 May 2010,"The talent/actors on hand here, are amazing. Ben Foster, Dennis Quaid, Norman Reedus and Cam Giganet to name the ones you might have heard of. But even the woman (a German actress), who you might never heard of, fits the bill. It's a great (action) story, that definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Without feeling cheap, like another movie, that I won't mention again here.A unique look, a great story (for an action packed sci-fi thriller that is) make an overall great impression. The fact, that the characters don't seem to know much more than the viewer, makes it more accessible. And although you wouldn't expect this from a movie that seems to be more concerned giving you a great thrill ride, it does have quite a few interesting ideas and questions, that appear throughout the movie. In other words, you can either just enjoy it or you can also use it, to think about some themes, that are shown in the movie.I really liked it a lot and I think the director (see his previous movie, too) can and will make an impact.",Pandorum
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"Very scary, one of the best sci fi horrors.",9,12 April 2011,"I very nearly allowed myself to be put off this movie by all the negative press and reviews which it received. I took a chance and bought the Blu Ray of it, wow, I was expecting a movie similar to Event Horizon or Sunshine, what i got was something way more impressive. I found myself with that scared sunken in the stomach feeling that i've not had for many a year, and certainly not had with recent horror films. What a very clever idea, strong acting, gorgeous effects, very novel to have such a mix of a cast. I find it very frustrating when i expect a lot from a film and don't get it, here the reverse has happened. I think most people would enjoy this. Think Dr Who Ark in Space meets Silent Hill, perhaps that's an idea of the mix. 9.5/10.00",Pandorum
6,ma-cortes,This frightening Sci-Fi movie concerns about some astronauts being trapped into a claustrophobic aircraft,7,24 October 2010,"This is a spectacular and moving story full of twists and turns ; however being pretty claustrophobic . It starts with two astronauts (Dennis Quaid , Ben Foster ) wake up from pods , they are solitaries and some has decimated the crew . One of them goes to explore the zone in where can live people no-infected . Meanwhile, the astronaut Bower attempting to survive , and he meets new survivors ( Antje Traue ,Norman Reedus, Cung Le ) hidden throughout the aircraft .Then, they encounter themselves chased by bloodthirsty,predatory monsters which have added them to his food chain. They must confront carnivorous mutants, hordes of warriors starving of human flesh and some of the most horrifying creatures ever made . The survivor group is surrounded , as they encounter a pack of carnivorous,crawling creatures that are waiting for them , facing their destruction and exposed to cruel bites by meat-eating sickos. They undertake a desperate fighting to survive and confronting each other.This exciting picture contains thrills, chills, plot twists, action-filled with fierce fights and lots of gore and guts . The terror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized . The film turns out to be a crossover between psychological issues of crew from ¨ Event horizon¨ , a certain similarity to the extraterrestrial attacks on the spacial corridors of ¨Alien saga ¨ , the weird monsters from ¨The descent¨ and ¨Resident evil¨ by Paul W. Anderson, here also producer , taking ideas here and there , resulting to be a fine movie . And of course the theme of people being stranded in a hostile, perilous environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of ¨Pitch black¨ . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames . It's predictable but also its predictability is redeemed for some extraordinary surprises and in part by the charismatic acting from the main protagonists , Quaid and Foster . The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams, shocks and tension. The make-up assistants create the truly terrible cannibals. Horrifying and astonishing images about eerie events with deserted and threatening corridors , such as the creepy scenarios in the large spacial craft without barely people , and covered of metal and iron . Cool , dark cinematography by Wendigo who creates a perfect atmosphere and haunting musical score fitting to action and horror . The motion picture is surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Christian Alvart who subsequently would direct another good terror film as ¨Case 39¨ .",Pandorum
7,BA_Harrison,Suffers from font issues.,5,21 October 2014,"2174 AD: The spacecraft Elysium, a massive 'ark' carrying the last vestiges of the human race, is launched from Earth—it's destination: Tanis, a planet capable of sustaining human life. Unfortunately, something has gone wrong during the flight, and when Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) emerges from hyper-sleep for his shift, he finds the ship over-run by hideous cannibalistic mutants.There's plenty wrong with Pandorum: the incoherent plot meanders aimlessly for almost two hours, the cinematography is way too dark throughout, and the incredible agility of the film's mutants is totally unbelievable (they pull off impressive martial arts moves and can do parkour!). Hell, even the font chosen for signage and digital displays on the Elysium irritates me, being 'cheesy futuristic' (and consequently rather illegible) rather than utilitarian.On a more positive note, the creatures are well realised and suitably vicious, the CGI is decent, the revelation at the end is kinda fun, and Antje Traue makes for great eye-candy.But that font",Pandorum
8,Quinoa1984,"derivative, but on its own terms it's got some chills and cool things, and acting",7,17 August 2010,"Watching Pandorum, it made me think back to other science fiction and as well horror movies ('horror' isn't listed as one of the genres of the film on IMDb though it should), but this is not entirely a negative for the movie itself. It has the same dark tunnels and claustrophobic lighting of the Descent and Alien (and the creatures of the Descent), it has the surreal nature of Event Horizon (as many have noted), and it has a take on humanity that is grim and cynical that has been seen in countless sci-fi. But the film also carries with it some genuinely good actors like Ben Foster, this instance playing a more heroic character instead of his usual villain, and Dennis Quaid as Peyton who is caught in the conflict of trying to help guide Foster's Bower and another man who has come out of one the tubes that has kept the astronauts in hyper- sleep.It's a deep-on-in-space story that, by its last reel, gets pretty silly and crazy, especially once the pandorum of the title sets in. It's a disease that infects the part of the brain that goes bonkers, and this is illustrated at one point by a man on another ship years before who had it and jettisoned hundreds of people out in to space (you know, cause he thought the ship was in trouble, that sort of thing). So the basic thrust of the plot is: find who else is alive (and sane) on the ship, and try not to get killed by these ravenous mutant-radioactive- whatever men who are almost like punk-rock orcs from Lord of the Rings. At the same time there's another layer of conflict on the fact that the ship was never really meant to find another crew or look for something missing, they *are* meant to be missing crew. Pandorum uses its 30 million dollar budget like a smart B-movie, and it shows. It's actually not as stupid or inane as any given number of sci- fi from the past several years, even as it does dip into being really stupid in certain parts (and you'll know which). And sure, the filmmakers do end up dipping into the ""WHAT A TWIST!"" batch in the last ten minutes or so, one of them, about the location of the ship and who really has pandorum, being a real doozy. Some of it may not even make much sense, but this disorientating feeling is part of what makes the film work. It may be more difficult to get others excited about stock characters, such as the lone ruthless a-hole survivor played by Eddie Rouse who pops up, says some exposition about what's really going on, and then captures the heroes and threatens their lives as he's a survivalist. He is a walking conventional, but Eddie Rouse is so good in the role that it's a big assist in elevating the material.A lot of this is elevated by the players, and by some really effective cinematography that brings out the dizzy and dark nature of the ship and the places they come across, and how faces look in blue and green lights. It's like a cinematographer's fun-house, and this goes a long way in distinguishing the material as well. It's not anything truly essential in science-fiction-horror-out-in-space, but for genre fans it shouldn't come as a disappointment for all things considered. It's a good-fun-unpretentious movie about people going crazy out in space.",Pandorum
9,michaelRokeefe,Is it just a state of mind?,7,20 January 2010,"A pair of astronauts (Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster)awake from an induced 125 year sleep to find themselves 500 miles from earth and in total darkness. They have no idea who they are, where they are going...let alone who and what else they may encounter on their motionless ship. The memory lose is referred to as pandorum and it gradually fades away. They can't jettison off into space only to die. Getting the craft running again is top priority...that and staying alive. The horrors that await them are beyond their imaginations.Suspense builds and tensions tighten. Special effects are imaginative and stark. This movie seems longer than its 108 minutes, but a delight to Sci-Fi fans. Not one of Quaid's best by far. Foster seems to be carrying most of the load; and aptly done. Also in the cast: Antje Traue, Cung Le, Cam Gigandet and Andre Hennicke.",Pandorum
10,Theo Robertson,Copy And Paste Sci-Fi Horror,4,8 November 2011,"The population of Earth keeps rising . By the mid 22nd Century wars and conflicts are fought over the scant resources remaining . If humanity are to survive then they need to find a habital planet . A spaceship from Earth finds a potential planet where mankind can flourish and survive Reading the above premise might remind you of a dystopian sci-fi movie from the 1970s . It's perhaps not the most original idea of a movie but in the 1970s over population was of some concern . It's a concern that's reinstated because in November 2011 the Earth's population stands at over 7 billion people and is still rising . Perhaps this impetus might make PANDORUM a more topical and compelling speculative film ? The bad news is that as soon as the opening captions stop so does any thought provoking ideas . This is a generic unoriginal SF/horror movie with an emphasis on action . Think SUNSHINE meets ALIENS meets EVENT HORIZON meets .... well have I missed anything out of the list ? certainly the producers haven't . I will give the makers some credit because I was expecting a couple of horny teenagers to appear at one point and for some surprising reason they failed to materializeAs stated the emphasis is on action and I'm guessing the commentators praising the film liked the action more than the plotting ? Certainly it can't be described as slow moving but for those of us who prefer narrative story telling more than elliptical editing . Ask yourself this - won't the indigenous population who've been eating the Earth crew quickly overwhelm the 1,217 survivors of the expedition . I guess the producers might have been hoping for a sequel where a bunch of gung ho space marines go to the planet and find themselves fighting for their lives against aliens but it's difficult to think of any plot that hasn't already been used with this movie",Pandorum
11,Scarecrow-88,Pandorum,7,5 February 2010,"Earth is coming apart at the seams and a ship is commissioned, the Elysium, on the direct coordinates to newly discovered planet, Tanis which can support human life. Ben Foster has a big part as Corporal Bower, an engineer who awakens disoriented from prolonged cryo-sleep. He opens the cryo-pod of who he believes to be his boss, Lieutenant Payton(Dennis Quaid), both of a flight crew whose other members seem to be nowhere in sight. The Elysium is in bad working order and the reactor seems to be malfunctioning. For some reason, both Payton and Bower can remember their training and job capabilities fully, but have a hard time recollecting memories other than what their able to do as officers in their specific fields. The bridge's door is closed and Bower knows he must find the reactor and restore it to bring back the power and lights for the Elysium to function properly. So he will brave a darkened and particularly threatening ship with ominous signs of danger. He finds cryo-chambers empty, rotted corpses, and, even worse than he could possibly imagine, mutated cannibalistic human lifeforms with a voracious appetite. Lucky for Bower he comes in contact with survivors who have braved the elements and will assist him in finding the reactor which is located far, far away. Along with Nadia(Antie Traue), a German, and Manh(Cung Le), a Vietnamese, both equipped with impressive fighting skills(..in order to survive in a ship crawling with an army of monstrous fiends, one must defend him/herself appropriately or else wind up lunch), Bower will follow their lead and hopefully heal the ship.Even with the synopsis I have written above, I think it's safe to say that there's plenty of surprises in store for the unadorned who have yet to see this sci-fi horror hybrid. The humanoid creatures(..their make-up effects created by Stan Winston's workshop)are a frightening brood, and the development of a type of ""illness"" that causes a psychological break called pandorum in the plot adds intrigue and twists which livens things up a bit. An interesting character introduced later into the film, named Gallo(played by the intense Cam Gigandet, whose appearance resembled as a baby spitting from a womb as his hand reaches out to Payton from within a collection of long black wires, soaked with oil)who seems a bit unhinged, communicates to Payton how only harm shall come to them if they do not leave the ship immediately. Quaid's character is quite an odd one. He seems very commanding and authoritative as such an officer should be, attempting to cancel out Gallo's endless negativity, a distracting noise that is detrimental to keeping focused with the task at hand. But, we see that something is causing Payton to suffer twitches, nose bleeds, and other not-so-ordinary problems causing unneeded stress. The film moves rather fast, surprising enough, once Bower aligns himself with Nadia and Manh, and their travels coincide with the arguments and tension festering between Payton and Gallo. There are lots of doors and corridors, large wires and spinning fans, the ship is vast and elongated..the detailed sets for this movie must've cost a fortune. The twist at the end regarding where the Elysium is actually located and how the ship came to be in such a disastrous state are handled effectively, I felt, and essentially we are kept in the dark as the characters are, only enlightened as the ship recuperates from near death while our heroes head for safety with the creatures in hot pursuit. I, for one, liked the ongoing sub plot involving Bower's search for his wife, who he, at first, believes to be aboard the ship somewhere. There are some really exciting combats between our heroes and mutant warriors who do not die easily. There are some really neat visual effects such as the screen for which Quaid toils with in his attempts to guide Bower to the reactor room, and the obligatory camera pan around the Elysium ship into the bridge and upon the crew as they hear the news of Earth's destruction.",Pandorum
12,Hey_Sweden,"Good acting, good atmosphere.",6,30 July 2012,"High tech science fiction / horror that, as has been pointed out, recalls films like ""Event Horizon"" and the ""Resident Evil"" series. As it begins, our story is already well under way, an interesting move that allows us to discover, along with the characters, what the hell is going on. Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster play crew members of a spaceship who get rudely awakened from their many year slumber, to find themselves alone (or so it seems at first) and that things have apparently gone very bad during their sleep. Foster, during his travels aboard this enormous ship, discovers some survivors as well as some non human killers that are fast, mean, and hungry. While an inevitable feeling of deja vu hangs over this film at times, it does at least succeed when enveloping its characters and audience in its ambiance. Eventually we get an idea of just how big this ship is, and how many places there are that can hold danger. As Foster makes his way towards the reactor, he encounters a few males (Norman Reedus, Cung Le, Eddie Rouse) and one female (Antje Traue) while Quaid runs into another, crazed individual (Cam Gigandet) whose actual identity the viewer might not expect. And that's one thing that helps in the enjoyment, the little twists along the way. Sometimes the film relies too much on video game styled action, exceedingly loud jump scares, and choppy editing, but it does have its suspenseful moments as well. What really holds ones' attention are the solid performances of Quaid and Foster, who for a bit are the only characters for us to follow. Unfortunately, none of the characters are fleshed out quite enough for us to really care that much about them; still, Foster provides a decent anchor for the film, which overall doesn't stand out too much from other films of its kind but is still fine of its type. It does begin and end well, and Rouse does add a bit of character. If the prospective viewer is an aficionado of this sort of thing, they should find it reasonably engrossing and interesting.

13,LeonLouisRicci,Audio & Action IncomprehensibleBut the Production Design is Sleek,5,7 September 2015,"A Sleek Production Design is about all this one has to offer that hasn't been offered before. The Producers thought it was Sleek enough to Show a lot of the Sets Under the Closing Credits. But that Reinforcement only Reinforces this, because that's about All that Remains after, because the Poorly Recorded Sound renders most of the Dialog Inaudible and the Mumbling and Accents Don't Help either.The Action Scenes are of the Modern Style of Shaking All Over, the Images just Flash about On Screen at such Hyper Speed it is Impossible to Grasp much of what is Taking Place. Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster are OK with what They are given to Work With, but You Can Sense a bit of Over Acting from the Rest.While mostly Familiar, the Film manages a few Inspired Images of the Monsters and the aforementioned Ambiance. But the Movie as a Whole Breaks Down with some very Clunky Things as well. ""Pandorum"" that is the Title is Talked to Death and the Battle of Wits between the Lieutenant and the Corporal at the End is Strained and Awkwardly Handled.Overall, Sci-Fi Completists might want to take a Look to Admire the Look of the Thing but Ultimately it Suffers from too many Postmodern and Unwelcome Tropes.",Pandorum
14,poolandrews,Sci-fi horror bore.,4,15 October 2010,"Pandorum is set in the distant future & starts as Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) wakes from a deep hyper-sleep, unable to remember anything he is soon joined by Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) who is also awoken from his deep hyper-sleep with memory loss. The two find themselves in a huge spaceship called the Elysium & are member of the flight crew, carrying almost six thousand people to a planet called Tanis in order to colonise it something has obviously gone wrong. Payton & Bower realise that the Elysium's reactor is shutting down & soon the ship will be powerless unless it is rebooted, Bower heads deep into the Elysium to find out what is going on & reactivate the reactor. However Bower soon discovers that the Elysium is home to mutant cannibal creatures & just getting to the reactor will be hard enough but as Bower's memory comes back he understands the true horrific reality of what he has woken up to...This German & British co-production was directed by Christian Alvart & is a fairly sloppily written sci-fi horror that at 108 minutes is far too long, far too dull & far too clichéd. The plot is divided into two, there's the boring running around in dark corridors trying not to get killed by cannibal mutants angle lifted straight from just about any horror film set on a spaceship with Alien (1979) in particular coming to mind & the sci-fi concept of a space voyage to colonise another planet as our own Earth has been exploited so much it cannot sustain human life anymore. Neither plot angle is particularly well handled, the mutant cannibals are other humans who awoke early & drugs given to them to help they acclimatise to Tanis mutated them to acclimatise to the dark corridors of the Elyison but whenever they catch another human all they seem to want to do is have a fight & instead of your typical Alien inspired attack scene we get some martial arts sequence that just seem out of place. The sci-fi elements are unravelled like a mystery, things start off as a complete mystery & as Pandorum progresses w are given clues & little bits of information that are meant to come together & make sense at the end which contains two supposedly big twists although I didn't feel either was that spectacular & certainly won't last long in my memory. At 108 minutes Pandorum is slow going, all the attack & horror scenes look exactly the same, the sci-fi about colonising another planet & human hope & endurance doesn't have any great impact because of the bitty unbalanced narrative & dull character's.I think one reason why Pandorum was a box-office flop is down to the title Pandorum, does anyone actually know what Pandorum means? It's not exactly a common word that you would expect to use is everyday conversation is it? The word Pandorum gives no real indication of what the film is like or about, it's just a strange random sounding word that to most people won't mean a thing. The mutant cannibals look like the creatures from the far superior The Desent (2005) & quite why they want to have martial arts fights with everyone they meet I don't know, the mutant at the end actually throw's a human a spear so it's a fair fight! There's little in the way of gore, there's some blood splatter & a slit throat but nothing else & we never get to see any flesh eating. The film looks nice enough & the CGI computer effects & futuristic production design are decent enough, the Elysium goes from the clean lines of the bridge to the grubby mess of the reactor where the mutants live as the makers try to give the Elysium some life & variety. The scares are all standard stuff, noises at the end of dark corridors, running & screaming mutants chasing people, lots of fake jump scares & nothing of any real substance or note.With a supposed budget of about $33,000,000 one has to say how did the makers manage to get that big a budget? While Pandorum looks nice it's a somewhat underwhelming film that many will have forgotten within a few hours. Filmed in Berlin in Germany. The acting is solid enough, Dennis Quaid is alright while Antje Traue does her best impression of Mila Jovovich from the Resident Evil films as tough high kicking female martial arts expert despite apparently only being a scientist.Pandorum is an average sci-fi horror with a plodding script that rips-off lots of other much better films, you just sit there thinking it all looks very familiar without ever being grabbed or engrossed by it. It's well made & it tells a story reasonably enough but I didn't think that much of Pandorum overall.",Pandorum

16,zardoz-13,"The Serious Side of ""Red Dwarf"" with Tribal Cannibals Instead of Cats!",4,26 September 2009,"Man is his own worst enemy in ""Antibodies"" director Christian Alvert's sci-fi horror chiller ""Pandorum,"" from the producers who gave us ""Event Horizon"" and the ""Resident Evil"" movies. The title refers to the psychological condition called bio-orbital disorientation syndrome that afflicts deep space travelers with paranoia and hallucinations, prompting them to go postal. Ironically, despite all the blood, gore, and nihilism, this nerve-racking, trans-galactic voyage—some 500 million miles from Earth--to colonize another planet wraps up its mayhem with a surprisingly old-fashioned finale. Indeed, the last thing that you would anticipate from this ghoulish, slay-or-be-slain, B-movie thriller is its cathartic ending. Basically, Alvert has appropriated an idea as venerable as the 1958 movie ""It! The Terror from Outer Space"" where a monster slipped aboard a space ship and terrorized the crew during their flight. Creepy as all get, ""Pandorum"" has everything going for it technically speaking from spectacular production designs, atmospheric photography, suspenseful predicaments, obstreperous villains and good acting. The chief liability is ""Street Gun"" writer Travis Molloy's predictable, uninspired screenplay. ""Pandorum"" is the kind of sci-fi movie that takes place in space but it has relatively little to do with sci-fi beyond its setting and mission. In other words, there are no alien creatures. None of the characters are sympathetic. One character is so spaced out that he pulls what amounts to a ""Fight Club"" routine where he has some rather incredible hallucinations. Worse, the plot is virtually incoherent despite a plethora of exposition. Ostensibly, this screamer is an excuse to have mutant, cannibal zombies on the warpath in a gargantuan cargo vessel in route to another world with the fate of mankind depending on the success of the mission. Alvert shuns subtlety and goes straight for the jugular. The villains are every bit as spooky as the killers in the chick flick monster picture ""The Descent,"" only these mutants are quick on their toes and lethal. Moreover, the squeamish are warned ahead of time to brace for several jump scenes designed to scare the daylights out of you when the killers pounce.""Pandorum"" opens with a stunning vista of the galaxy as the 22nd-century spacecraft Elysium cruises its way through the universe. Inside the massive ship, a technician in a cryogenic chamber awakens and initially cannot remember anything. We are told that this is a reaction to hyperspace deep sleep. This opening is roughly similar to Ridley Scott's classic ""Alien"" where the crew members come out of stasis to answer a distress call. Here, two flight crewmen awaken and find themselves alone on a cargo ship. Just to complicate things, Bower (Ben Foster of ""3:10 to Yuma"") and Payton (Dennis Quaid of ""G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra"") find themselves locked into their chamber with the clock ticking down on the nuclear reactor that has to be powered up again or everything goes kaput. Lieutenant Payton dispatches Bower to find the reactor since Bower is a reactor technician, while Payton stays behind and guides him via a two-way transmitter with a built-in homing device. Bower grovels on his belly and wiggles through crawlspaces teeming with air ducts in pitch black darkness with only a flashlight and glow sticks to illuminate his path. We follow Bower as he penetrates the shadowy bowels of the spacecraft, while Payton does nothing exciting other than constantly inquire about Bower's status when he doesn't respond. German lenser Wedigo Van Schultzendorff accentuates the claustrophobic surroundings with eerie lighting and weird compositions. Essentially, this means that the scenes with Bower are adrenalin-laced ghoul shows, while Payton sits at a console and does relatively nothing until the filmmakers add a gratuitous character to liven up the Quaid scenes. Milloy could have done something more interesting with Payton's character. Nevertheless, the spacecraft Elysium is the last place anybody would want to find themselves trapped. Bowers encounters an Asian guy, Manh (Cung Li of ""Fighting""), who knows enough martial arts to kick butt. They make friends with each other and then they run into a woman, Nadia (German actress Antje Traue) who proves herself every bit the Asian's match when it comes down to close-quarters, hand-to-hand combat. Our hero learns not long afterward that the Elysium is infested with some ghastly-looking, mutant humans that have cadaverously pale complexions, resemble aboriginal headhunters from the worst part of the Amazon, and can run like devils over short hops. They hunt in packs and they usually get their victim.Later, we learn that the Elysium has been easing through space for the last 923 years. Evidently, the trip didn't agree with some of the passengers, and these people have regressed into screaming, homicidal, hell-bent-for-leather cannibals. The suspense that ""Pandorum"" conjures up grows out of our hero's desperate need to survive these hellions and carry out his mission to save the Elysium. The surprising thing about ""Pandorum"" is that it is only intermittently scary. Indeed, the flesh feasting mutants provide a clear and present danger to our heroes and they amount to worthwhile adversaries. Unfortunately, since they can no more communicate their ideas in English than Manh can, they are one-dimensional and exist for the shock factor. You have to listen extremely closely to the bits and pieces of dialogue to learn how they came about. Alvert brings them out to quicken the film's pulse and put our heroes through a ringer. The battle between one of the mutants and Manh is reminiscent of a fight between a western hero and an Indian.Altogether, ""Pandorum"" has a lot going for it, but Alvert and Milloy's poor storytelling skills undercut their best efforts.",Pandorum
17,grantss,Had potential but ultimately quite unoriginal and dull,4,26 September 2018,"It is the year 2174. The spaceship Elysium is sent to colonise a distant planet. Several years into the voyage, two crewmembers wake up from hypersleep to discover that all their colleagues are missing. Despite this, it appears that they are not alone...From the basic plot, the movie had potential. Yes, it didn't seem too original - the whole ""space crew members wake up to find their buddies missing, and something sinister afoot"" thing has been done heaps of times before, but I was hoping for something intriguing, at least, if it couldn't be original. Unfortunately, no such luck. No slow burn, with scraps of information being fed to you to keep you hooked. The sinister presence is revealed pretty early on, and from then on it is pretty much a straight forward humans vs creatures sci-fi-action movie. Plot becomes close to non-existent, with action being the only focus.So even more unoriginal than expected and no intrigue, just dull, conventional action scenes.Very disappointing and quite a grind to get through.",Pandorum
18,neil-476,Flawed. Very flawed.,6,7 October 2009,"There is quite a good, if derivative, sci-fi action horror thriller struggling to get out of the mess which is Pandorum. Unfortunately it never quite makes it.Waking from deep sleep on board a space ark, Ben Foster has to make his way to the far end of the huge ship in order to re-fire the atomic reactor. He has to do this in almost total darkness even though he doesn't know the way and is suffering from deep sleep-induced amnesia, and despite the presence of both lightning fast ravenous monstery things and other humans who are far from co-operative and helpful. Thankfully, he is being helped by his superior officer Dennis Quaid who is guiding him from a kind of clockwork powered GPS system (or at least that's what it looked like), This movie owes huge debts to 2001, Alien, and Event Horizon. The story isn't actually bad, but it is told in such utter darkness with such frenetic camera work that it is often impossible to follow exactly what's going on. Add to this dialogue which is often incomprehensible in the middle of sudden ear-splitting noises, and a sequence of obstacles which exist, video game-style, for no other purpose than simply to be another obstacle (why, for instance, is there such time urgency to restart the reactor? How fortunate that this one fellow just happened to wake up at this precise moment. Or are all the crew qualified to restart the reactor?) and some elements of Pandorum become annoying.I forgot to mention Pandorum itself (which, I think, is a name given to what happens when you go stir crazy on a spaceship, though I'm not sure) which is in the movie solely to explain a plot twist.And I'm afraid I can't take Ben Foster seriously as action hero - he looks strikingly like Nicholas Lyndhurst who plays Britain's favourite gormless TV comedy character.I have two positive comments, though. One, I was delighted not to see the wife of Ben Foster's character appear suddenly, transformed (or not) into a ravening monster thingie. And, two, I liked the ending.",Pandorum
19,evanston_dad,"Everything About ""Pandorum"" Suggests Some Better Movie",4,8 February 2010,"""Pandorum"" reminded me more than a little of Danny Boyle's ""Sunshine,"" which is not a good thing. It also reminded me, as it clearly has others, of ""Alien"" and ""The Descent."" In fact, many people who talk about this movie start their comments by referring to all of the other (better) movies it reminded them of. Perhaps a sign of unoriginality?Dennis Quaid is the nominal star of this queasy hybrid of visceral horror and psychological suspense. It's very poorly made in most respects. The direction and editing are confusing; action scenes are put together with no sense of placement, and it's always virtually impossible to tell where one character is in relation to another. The cinematography is so murky that it's literally hard to see anything taking place on screen. The sound is bad -- much of the dialogue is delivered in stage whispers that one can barely hear, all of the sound effects are pitched at ear-splitting volume. And the screenplay is confusing and obtuse.The movie does have one positive thing going for it, and that's its production design. Unfortunately, it too often rips off of the groundbreaking work of....you guessed it....""Alien,"" and even if it didn't the film is so poorly choreographed that you can't really see the production design half the time.This movie isn't scary, and it's not really even any good.Grade: C",Pandorum
20,FlashCallahan,We are the cargo......,6,17 January 2016,"Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard an abandoned spacecraft. It's dark, they are disoriented, and the only sound is coming from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything about who they are, and what their mission was. With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the ships secrets are revealed, and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined.........Space horror should be one of the most easiest sub genres to tackle. After all, all you need is an empty space craft, minimum lighting, and something else a little more sinister waiting in the shadows.........but then you run the risk of being compared to Alien time and time again. So then the film makers try to do something a little different to put a spin on a well worn genre.Sometimes they work, Event Horizon is a very underrated movie, and then you have something like Pandorum, a supposed beginning to a trilogy, and the first chapter has to grip you from the get go, to keep you interested, but the writers try to cram too much into this movie, and instead of it being a tense fight for survival, it ends up like Orcs In Space.........With Dennis Quaid as the puppet master.But Foster is wonderful as the corridor running second mate, showing all the panic that you would expect to have being chased by beasts after your blood, and not knowing why you are there.Quaid is okay, but he's on autopilot, thinking about his pay rather than his performance, so his little subplot featuring Cam Gigadent is both boring and confusing.But it looks great, the sets are great, they give you a real sense of claustrophobia, and I remember when I saw this on the big screen, I enjoyed it a whole lot more than I did on Blu Ray. Seeing it on the big screen gave it a more immersing effect, taking you away from the hokum that is the narrative.So turn the lights off, put it on the biggest screen you can, and just enjoy it for what it is, sweaty Foster running away from Orcs.In Space.",Pandorum
21,Aaron1375,"At times I thought I was watching ""Dead Space"" the movie.",7,31 January 2010,"This movie was rather good, not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but for a movie that went virtually unnoticed at the box office it was surprisingly good. Just seemed something more needed to be added, I can not pinpoint what it is, just that it felt incomplete somehow. The plot has an astronaut waking up in his sleep chamber in rather unpleasant fashion. His memory is spotty to say the least and he is totally disoriented. Though he does use a razor that I would love to have as I am betting it would be the closest shave ever. Well he soon wakes up another member of the team and they both deduce that they are members of the flight team. They are apparently on a giant vessel that is flying through space and are part of a rotating shift of pilots on this vessel, only they were supposed to have been woken up by the shift before them so something is up. Well the one member who woke up first starts crawling through the air ducts and it is not to long after he plummets out that he meets a rather aggressive lady and something else that does not appear to be human. So the rest of the movie is this guy trying to get to the reactor of the ship as it is causing problems while the other guy directs him when he is able. The cast is rather good as Ben Foster steals the show as the guy who does everything and Dennis Quaid is good too as the guy who is having a bit of trouble talking him through this mess while also dealing with another shipmate who may be suffering from a sickness caused by space travel called Pandorum. It is also interesting that they titled the film after this illness as I was figuring it would be the name of the ship or something to that effect. There is some gore here an there and some tense moments as well as a few somewhat surprising plot twists. Just needed maybe another plot twist here or there or perhaps had a different one here or there and maybe a bit more monster action and I would have liked it a bit more. Still, it was quite strange in a good way which made it interesting.",Pandorum
22,zetes,"I wasn't expecting this to be any good, but I was very pleasantly surprised",8,17 October 2010,"Surprisingly excellent sci-fi thriller. I hadn't heard much good about it, mostly that it was pretty derivative. Well, yeah, maybe. The monsters are definitely a big rip-off of those in The Descent, and even those didn't feel that original. And the space madness angle has been done before. But Pandorum makes up for its lack of originality with quick and confident storytelling, exceptional visual design and with fine performances by Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid. There are a lot of genuinely scary moments. I would complain that the action sequences are kind of incoherently shot (surely to distract the audience from the fact that the CGI monsters are pretty poor). There are some hiccups here and there, but it quickly moves past them so you don't notice. There are a lot of clever twists. It's very good.",Pandorum
23,trashgang,The Descent and Creep in outta space,5,21 March 2010,"The hype surrounding Pandorum left me with a bitter feeling. It was stated as a kind of Alien flick. But when I watched it it was something different. A lot of the movie is played in the dark. So that part had some scary moments, jump scene's I mean. And that part reminded me of The Descent when some creatures pop up. Here we have the same. I won't spoil the plot but hereto those creatures came out of nothing. The faces reminded me of Creep, also a flick about deformed humans. And sometimes it reminded me of Space Oddity 2001, the conversations. But still due the scary moments and the sometimes gory parts the film delivers what we suspected. I'm not that big SF fan but SF horror that I like. This is a mix between both. But I agree, it has been a while that this kind of SF was made, I guess since Event Horizon. It's worth watching but for some the conversations between Bower and Peyton will be a let down.",Pandorum

Dark scenes, creepy monsters/aliens, a good script and good actors. Maybe the movie itself was a bit with too many dark shots but then again they were in space in a defaulting spaceship, so not many light available. The monsters were creepy enough to make it interesting to watch. Plus I thought the storyline was well written and easy to follow. It's for sure better then a lot of other sci/fi horror movies. The actors came all out very believable in their respective roles. And there was definitely the perfect amount of suspense to keep you intrigued in what's going to happen next.

25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Pandorum,8,2 November 2009,"I've not been too impressed with that many science-fiction thriller/horror films set in outer space since, well, probably Alien and Aliens, but Pandorum turned out to be something of a different ball game altogether. It's been too long since I last enjoyed a film of this genre, and who would have thought this was something originally planned for a direct to video release. It looks gorgeously dark, and pretty much entertaining from start to finish, keeping you guessing until the mid-way mark, while letting the gloomy, pessimistic atmosphere envelope you.I suppose of late the premise of our Earth dying, and deep space vessels built to bring selected people on that colonizing trip to far flung planets, have been the It thing in many contemporary science fiction films, since it plays on the fact that we're continuously ravaging the planet and payback time is just around the corner. To avoid extinction, by then in the future we'd come up with such a Noah's Ark to transport ourselves somewhere else to get that fighting chance of survival, and the film pretty much starts off with Ben Foster's Corporal Bower waking up in a pod, and emerging into a darkened space hull where it seems like he's the only survivor.If you'd want to nitpick, there are adequate avenues to do so, and in fact sometimes right from the start. Take for instance the waking up from deep, hibernating sleep, where it'll take a while for one to re-orientate oneself and remember stuff. So why didn't anyone think of at least waking up to a notebook readily available with basic facts and figures? Like I mentioned, these trivialities should be checked at the door, because the payload's very much worth over these little inconsequential asking of Whys, some of which do get addressed as the film moved along.Corporal Bower soon gets joined by Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) and together they try to make sense of their predicament, with the higher ranking officer guiding his only man to do the grunt work of hitting the ground, while he well, pretty much does environmental monitoring over at the console chamber. And of course this allows Ben Foster, who has been extremely impressive in his supporting role in 3:10 To Yuma, to take the opportunity to shine again as the ground-soldier-flight-engineer to implement his plan of reviving the ship's nuclear reactor before the main systems shut down for good.And this of course allows for adequate set action sequences to take place as uneasy alliances get forged with respective, primal human survivors that Bower comes across, and pit them against some really pasty white and dexterous creatures that feed on both humans and cannibalizing their own fallen comrades, courtesy of Stan Winston Studios. While they may seem to move in confined spaces with stealth, cunning and speed reminiscence of those in the Alien franchise, somehow the cinematography and angles chosen seem to make it all a tad difficult at times to make out who's doing what, and who's attacking who, though when it does get its act together, it's edge-of-your-seat material, especially when it successfully exploits its ""boo"" moments to scare.There are some impressive sets and effects that do make you sit up and take notice, and for a relatively modest budgeted film, the filmmakers have pulled off quite the miracle in creating this environment full of questions asked. The story by Travis Milloy plays out like one huge mystery for the audience to solve, though of course its twist is nothing not already seen before, but still rather effectively put on screen by director Christian Alvart.Pandorum has been playing for some time already and screening is now relegated to a few halls and limited screening times. Do yourself a favour and catch this before it disappears from here for good!",Pandorum
26,siderite,"Nicely done, but failed at the end",7,3 December 2009,"I was close to grade this movie above average because it really started well. You have Dennis Quaid as the amnesic lieutenant with logic and command skills and Ben Foster as the younger, slightly claustrophobic, technician that can actually do something about the failing ship. Heh, techs ftw!So I was expecting a powerful character driven, full of tension, getting Dennis Quaid to his proper place as a great actor, movie. And it went that way for a while, then it started losing the story in special effects and creatures and shocked people that are not helpful, ended up in a ""last minute"" reactor fix that annoyed me off, then ended up in a maelstrom of mental confusion.What was the point of that ending? What a great movie this could have been! So, yeah, it was mostly above average, but it failed its potential towards the end in a big way.Bottom line: mix a bit of Alien with a bit of Event Horizon, and when it starts to taste wonderful, put a lot a water in to spoil it.",Pandorum
27,Smells_Like_Cheese,Sci-Fi 2009,6,26 October 2009,"Back in the wonderful decade that was known as the 1970's, many wonderful movies were released, including some of my favorite horror films. The Exorcist, Jaws, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, etc. Another classic horror film that was released was Alien, a film that was like no other. The reason why, it was something different, when it's a haunted house you can easily say to the person on screen ""GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!"", when it's in space well, you can't exactly say anything. Alien broke the horror space genre with new terrifying concepts and effects that had never been seen before. Ever since then, many movies have tried to copy Alien's formula. 2009 has now brought us Pandorum, a fast paced film not just about scary creatures on board but the whole concept of madness. All goes together well in a sci-fi horror film. The only problem with Pandorum? Maybe it was a little too 2009 with the filming.Two astronauts, Bower and Payton, wake to find themselves drifting through space 500 million miles from Earth and with no memory of who they are, what they are doing, or what has happened to the crew of their 60,000 passenger space ship. They are unable to access the ship's bridge, and cannot communicate with any other members of the crew, including the flight team they are to relieve. While exploring the spacecraft under Payton's radio guidance, Bower encounters several other surviving crew members, and the astronauts start to learn that a terrible event has occurred on board which might have affected the survival of the entire human species. As Bower ventures deeper into the ship, he discovers other humans running from monsters that are former crew members endowed with genetic enhancements meant to help them adapt to their eventual new world, but which instead caused them to mutate to the spacecraft environment. They also learn that some crew members also suffer from a psychosis, a severe psychological condition called Pandorum, which can be brought about by being in deep-space for extended periods of time, and is triggered to an uncontrollable level by intense emotional trauma. Those afflicted with Pandorum experience severe paranoia, vivid hallucinations and eventually homicidal rage.Pandorum is an extremely good story and has a great new look for these scary space creatures that are chasing after our hero's of the ship. They basically look like Alien if they were dressed like theater ushers with flash lights, lol. Well not that dorky, they are actually pretty scary looking. Acting wise, we have decent enough, Ben Foster who's career is blossoming as we speak pulls in a strong enough male lead. We also have our veteran who is familiar with the sci-fi genre, Dennis Quaid who steals the show with his constant questioning madness. The only thing that stops me from recommending this to see it in the theater is just the way it was made. Unfortunately, the fast and shaky camera movements were too much to see what was going on in the scene and I had to re-think some of the scenes in my head in order to figure them out. But other than that, it's a good scare for the Halloween season and is worth the watch.6/10",Pandorum
28,KineticSeoul,Space madness!!!,5,16 February 2010,"Watching this movie was like watching ""Mortal Kombat"" go down in space. I was actually expecting this film to be pretty scary, but it was claustrophobic at times but not really scary. And also has some elements of ""Event Horizon"" as well which was a much more entertaining flick. It also seems that a lot of people are comparing this movie to ""The Descent"" and I agree but ""The Descent"" was a much better movie as well, as a matter of fact this movie is a mash up of different movies. The twist at the end wasn't even good and just nothing really about this film is terrifying or anything, besides the cramped ship itself. It's a cliché of sci-fi horror movies from the past, and there is almost no character development as well. It's watchable, but just go watch ""Event Horizon"" instead.5.3/10",Pandorum
29,sddavis63,"""Descent"" On A Spaceship",7,7 June 2010,"This is a pretty decent, suspenseful movie that reminded me very much of the movie ""Descent"" - except for the fact that it's set on a spaceship rather than in a cave. That environment, though, creates the same claustrophobic feeling of the other movie, and as the movie progresses, there's the same seemingly hopeless sense that grows as a small group of people try to survive against strange, human-like ravenous creatures.The movie opens with a pair of astronauts being jarred awake from some type of suspended animation. Apparently, earth has exhausted its resources, and this group on the spaceship is being sent to another earth-like planet to colonize it. Something, though, has gone dreadfully wrong. Astronauts Payton and Bower (Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster) awaken to a nightmare. The crew has disappeared, and there's something on the ship with them. The mystery unfolds slowly but deliberately; the suspense is built quite well. A few other scattered survivors are introduced, and the origin of the ravenous creatures gets hinted at a few times but is never definitely explained.This is a good sci-fi thriller; very enjoyable for fans of the genre.",Pandorum

I was sad it didn't hit me harder. And i think it was the execution. Why would you suggest earlier in the movie that it could be much longer than we think. Imagine if we kept being told that it's only been 8 years. Then reveal that it's been 900+, and the young dude is the old dude, and they're already on tanis.

31,Robert_duder,Brilliant and dark twisted tale well worth seeing,8,7 December 2009,"I went into Pandorum virtually blind knowing only a couple of very small things. First that it was science fiction/horror...a genre I love, and second that it starred Dennis Quaid and I do enjoy Quaid a great deal and think he's quite under rated. I also figured given the low advertising of the film that it was a low budget indy type film and that's okay too. So I was blown away and incredibly pleased that the film turns in a twisted, dark, creepy story about isolation and insanity, two of my favorite themes in a great horror film. Is it incredibly original? No I suppose not but that didn't make it any less entertaining with a terrific twist that I should have seen coming but was still wicked cool when it all unraveled. The low budget is used sparingly and they don't hold anything back. The film makers absolutely did everything they could to set up an eerie setting and you won't for a moment think about how low budget the film is and I think that is an impressive feat for any indy like film. Nearly the entire film is performed more or less by the two lead actors and one from a single room and yet it doesn't stop the action or the story.Ben Foster has certainly become an actor to watch. Believe it or not I first noticed him in the 2001 Shakespeare remake Get Over It which I thought he was excellent in. As astronaut Bower who is first to wake up aboard the ship and get his bearings he is intriguing to watch. He has a terrific range in this role and he demonstrates a believable descent into madness that gradually unfolds. Dennis Quaid is a hit and miss actor but I still have always enjoyed him in leading roles. I don't think he ever quite got a break through role but he is still terrific. He is superb as lead astronaut Payton who spends nearly the entire film in one room but still gives a depth and intriguing performance to his character. The two of them carry this movie single handed with very little special effects. They are enthusiastic and watchable and make the film superb.German director Christian Alvart is relatively new to the big screen but he clearly has a style to really watch for in the future. I think he has a style and talent about him for sci-fi and the creepier side of things. Also writer Travis Milloy doesn't have a lot of experience in Hollywood and yet he clearly has a passion for his project. I think although initial box office returns were not stellar that Pandorum will build a following with word of mouth. A smart science fiction thriller with plenty of horror mixed in, well made, well written, and well acted by everyone including the supporting cast. I didn't go into details about the supporting cast because they didn't get a lot of really stand out moments but they were still vital to the story and they did a great job. As mentioned the twist to the entire film fits in really well and its not the kind of twist you won't see coming but you'll walk out of the theater thinking...that was kinda cool. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who loves the genre or wants something just well made and entertaining that'll give you chills in all the right ways. 8.5/10",Pandorum
32,bowmanblue,The good outweighs the bad,9,13 May 2014,"Sometimes you watch a film and just so happen to like it so much that, even though you're aware of the negative elements, you can happily choose to ignore them and just go with it. Welcome to Pandorum.It's about two astronauts who wake up aboard their giant spaceship, only to find things haven't exactly gone according to plan. And the plan? Well... they can't actually remember as – apparently – prolonged hypersleep gives you amnesia (I thought it just made you 'a bit groggy' if Ripley was anything to go by in Aliens?). However, what they do know is that their – once habitable – spaceship is now chock full of flesh-eating monsters, so it's fair to say that Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid are due for a really bad day. Cue their quest to get from one side of the ship to the other to (a) access the bridge and (b) stop the ship from blowing up (as spaceships have a tendency to do right at the inopportune time).Okay, so the plot probably hasn't exactly blown you away with its originality, but, believe it or not, it's pretty damn good. It was never destined to be a blockbuster or to set the box office alight, mainly because it's been made for a niche audience, i.e. those who enjoy sci-fi AND horror mixed together. Pandorum borrows slightly from a multitude of films. Of course 'Alien' has to be mentioned, as they're both dark, extremely claustrophobic and see our helpless humans stalked by something much nastier. But, more recently, 1997's 'Event Horizon' has to be mentioned, due to it being about the biggest (and most recent – despite the twelve year gap between it and Pandorum) sci-fi/horror film to come before Pandorum. Then there seems to be shades of '28 Days Later' somewhere in there. Okay, so there aren't any zombies (or 'infected' if you want the technical term), but the way Pandorum is filmed seems to suggest that there's a connection to the two.So, if you liked Event Horizon, Alien, or 28 Days Later, you should enjoy Pandorum. I certainly did. And managed to overlook the slight annoyance of just how dark it was. I don't mean in tone (although the tone is pretty dark, too), but in the way it was shot. Yes, I appreciate it's set on a spaceship with little power, but sometimes (especially during action sequences), you may find it quite difficult to work out what you're watching. Gripe aside, I love this film anyway. Apparently, it was meant to be the first part of a trilogy. That probably won't happen, but as a stand-alone movie it works pretty well, too.A cult hit of the future.",Pandorum
33,dromasca,efficient space horror,7,28 April 2015,"'Pandorum' is not a very inventive or original film. Horror stories about space-ships overtaken by horrible monsters were already told a few times. The 'Alien' series is probably the most (deservedly) famous item of the genre. 'Pandorum' has no Sigourney Weaver in the lead role, and no HR Giger designed the sets - yet it's quite a pleasure to watch with no dull moments, of course, only if you are an adept of the genre.The century is the 22nd and mankind succeeded - as we all know by now that it will happen, especially if we watch many apocalyptic movies - to make planet Earth almost inhabitable. The only hope for mankind is a huge space Arch of Noah traveling in search of other habitable planets. Cryo-hibernation is the only way to survive the length of the trip, but the technology has some side effects which are used in a smart manner by the authors of the story. The lead heroes will have to fight not only the hideous monsters but also themselves or better say the psychological effects of the long and cold sleeping periods.Such reasonable (in science-fiction terms) premises set the stage for an entertaining confrontation which is well filmed and reasonably acted (by Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster). German director Christian Alvart sets the right pace and adds a tone of Gothic horror to the whole story. The sets and the cinematography fit well and add to the atmosphere.

36,callanvass,"Average Sci-Fi outing, with not enough originality in it for my tastes.",5,11 March 2010,"Pandorum has a potentially great story, but I've seen this kinda stuff all before. Lead character wakes up with a lost identity trying to figure out who he is, with flashes of his life. Similar movies like Event Horizon, etc have done this thing before, and done better at that. The atmosphere is fittingly chilling at times I will admit that, but I just didn't get the thrills I expected out of this. The creatures that attacked the crew just didn't seem menacing to me, and the attacks felt uninspired, not only that having a Kung Fu guy try to attack the creatures, it just seemed rather silly to me. It also didn't help that I had trouble caring for any one of these people. Bower|Ben Foster| is supposed to be the hero, yet I didn't give a damn about what happened to him. The ending left me pretty confused as well, along with the rest of the movie, I just had trouble getting into it.Performances. Ben Foster did well with what he was given, but I couldn't give a damn about what happened to him, because the script didn't do enough to make me care. Dennis Quaid is always a reliable actor, and here is no different. He put on an intense show, but again I didn't give a damn about what happened to Payton. Cam Gigandet is pretty intense himself as Corporal Gallo. He creeped me out more then once, that's for sure. Antje Traue is cute and did fine with what she had to do, I liked a couple of her lines. Cung Le is OK as the token Kung Fu guy.Bottom line. I just couldn't get into this fully. It just seemed to half-cooked for my liking, and I didn't have anyone to root for. Worth a look on a rainy weekend when you have nothing else to watch, but I can't say this is anything more then a rental.5/10",Pandorum

With elements from ALIEN (1979) and ALIENS (1986) as well as PREDATOR (1987), PANDORUM is a dark mysterious and monster movie along with a darker psychological thriller that is well paced, gripping in its intensity that is enhanced by a heart wrenching soundtrack of clanking and crashing sounds. This is an intelligent, slick, and creepy, and dark exploration through the bowels of a ship, lost in space, with deep cold space storage amnesia...A space BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) out of control. Dennis Quaid has a strong role along with Ben Foster and Antje Traue. This movie is exciting, gripping, and a roller coaster ride of intensity...With a few stereotypical script points that only dent this movie (i.e., the rickety ramp, the suddenly weak girl scene) are balanced by an above average thinking movie that incorporates a solid plot line with humanity, insanity, animal instinct, and human reason.",Pandorum

Anyway Ben Foster really held this odyssey like brilliant paranoia filled clever and refreshing gemstone. I love this movie so much, I love the soundtrack, the dark tone, the creatures, the writing, and scientific otherworldly aspect. This is an awesome and thrilling experience every time I see it. Cam Gigandet is great as the psychosis spiraling corporal that shows up halfway in, and Dennis Quaid was a delight as the nurturing lieutenant after things hit the fan.

40,Rodrigo_Amaro,With many in's and out's but good,9,14 February 2011,"Before this film was released I heard a lot of comments on boards here telling that ""Pandorum"" looked like ""Event Horizon"" simply by watching the trailer. Well, the connections between both films are easy to make since both includes the name of Paul W.S. Anderson (""Resident Evil"" series) behind credits (different functions though) and shares some similarities (including a plot twist at the ending involving one of the main characters). Also the fact both films were critically rejected and didn't performed well at box-office. Both are very underrated too! ""Pandorum"" takes advantage of ""Event Horizon"" with a more fascinating plot, great dramatic moments among other things.Far away in space and in a distant future, Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster are military in space who, after eight years of hibernation, are suddenly awake in their ship without knowing what happened to the crew, and to the ship functions. After discovering they're not alone, and with them there's some strange cannibalistic creatures and few other crew members, they need to find out the mystery behind all this and why they cannot contact with Earth. With a great premise that slowly reveals a gripping mystery ""Pandorum"" is a amazing drama in the first part that disappears giving space to some action and some scary moments. As a drama where we meet the two main characters it's a excellent film, with thrills and mysteries that makes you glued to the seat; when it comes to present more and more characters and action situations it's not so successful, it lacks of a more suitable edition work in the fight scenes (wheter Ben Foster fighting with a monster or with another character, since they cannot trust each other) where most of the time it was difficult to see who were doing what and to whom, it is too fast. And when it gets close to the conclusion it gets a little bit tiresome and excessive.A film starred by Foster can't go wrong and he's very good on scene; Quaid is quite good as the ship's major officer but the screenplay wasn't fair with him by placing his character in a passive behavior during the first hour, because everything happens to Foster, he gets lost in the ship, is attacked, but nothing happens to Quaid when he's in the deck of command which is unusual for a top billing performer. Andre Hennicke, Cam Gigandet and Norman Reedus are reduced to some small parts while Antje Traue and Cung Le has some good moments as Foster's partners in the ship, the only humans left behind. Many unseen things makes of ""Pandorum"" a very good film and a must see for sci-fi fans. 9/10",Pandorum
41,TheMovieDiorama,Pandorum succumbs to its own delirious psychosis.,4,21 February 2019,"A small dosage of 'Resident Evil', a splash of 'The Descent' and the claustrophobic setting of 'Alien'. These Lovecraftian horror elements should've been fully maximised to create an atmospheric sci-fi horror. But despite the often intriguing plot strands, it's a boring dull mess. Human overpopulation leads to an interstellar ark being built to find an inhabitable planet and colonise it, however some crew members are abruptly woken up and must survive against a horde of cannibalistic humanoids. Again, another case of wasted potential. The ideology of maintaining a newly evolved society instead of reviving current civilisation was an interesting perspective, which brings across many religious overtones and themes of existentialism. Yet, my resistance to boredom was weak and unfortunately this film was too poorly executed and directed to save me from falling asleep. It's low-budget thrills were unable to keep me entertained, with the strangely athletic cannibals being the main focus. These ""horror"" scenes had no suspense or mystery, as the first cannibal the corporal comes across is fully shown to the audience, leaving little to the imagination. The fast-forward editing to make these creatures seem fast, with half second jump cuts and limited lighting accompanying this, only made the experience nauseating and impossible to see. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any personality (honestly, looking at space for 108 minutes would've been more charismatic). Foster's performance was fine, but Quaid's was terrible. Any twists that did occur towards the third act were predictable and made no impact to the story and its characters. The constant need for explanations and theories made the plot extremely bloated, diminishing chances for character development, which ultimately is Pandorum's downfall. More attention should've made to the eponymous psychosis and not the cannibal mutants, atleast then it would've been more original and concise. Alas, it's just another dim star in the vast space of science-fiction.",Pandorum

He created the mutants on purpose.In Covenant, A.

But the journey is a long one, with much of it spent asleep and plenty of things can go wrong. Things like the dreaded pandorum.Pandorum is pretty typical as far as these post-Alien style space horror films go. You have a tight, claustrophobic spaceship with limited resources, dark shadows and lots of little nooks and crannies to hide in. And then you have the unexplainable, the primordial horror that will hunt you until you have nowhere left to run.Unfortunately the story is not good enough to keep up the suspense and the mood. The beginning of the movie is pretty interesting, but it becomes quickly apparent that the film doesn't have enough material, style or finesse to support a full-length feature film and thus most of the scenes are padded beyond the comfort zone. Especially the second act is filled with meaningless wandering, pointless conversations and dull action scenes.Not to say that there are no upsides to this film. The actual spaceship has a cool design and the various settings are varied and interesting enough to keep us intrigued. The characters are not the greatest strength the film has, but neither are they all that bad. You can see the final twist coming from miles away, yet it's told proficiently enough that you don't mind all that much.And that's pretty much Pandorum summarized. It's not the worst example of a scifi film I've seen, but it's just clumsy enough that you cannot really get into its story. It has good production values, but takes too much time with its story, thus watering down the suspense and the horror.",Pandorum

Technical solutions are catchy and there are some twists in the plot, but the single place of action becomes gradually boring. Variety of technical and medical terms does not make watching this move easier or more interesting either. And the ending... Not according to my taste.As for actors, only Ben Foster (outstanding as usual) and Dennis Quaid have caught my eye, but the latter could have had more time on screen (his role is different from most of his other ones). The rest are nothing special, one would easily forget them in their other performances. Their fight scenes are more awkward than thrilling.If such a movie originated from the end of last century, I would have voted higher.

I'm being a realist.Considering the destructive ways of humans - No one can expect me to ever believe that our species would ever do anything different on Tanis other than what's been so harmfully done on Earth (which, as Pandorum's story goes, ultimately made our planet uninhabitable).I'm sorry if what I've said doesn't sound like a very optimistic viewpoint, but, as far as I'm concerned, I hope that man destroys himself long before he's able to get off this planet and inhabit other worlds.

47,dfranzen70,Better than Event Horizon and Ghost Ship combined,7,24 September 2009,"Echoing such luminous sci-fi classics as 2001 and Alien, Pandorum is a terrific psychological thriller, although it does struggle at times to be coherent and original. But it's a true mindbender, and it's packed with action that moves so quickly neither the actors nor the audience can really catch a breath, which is a good move if your plot is shaky to begin with.As with the best deep-space movies, the context is mental illness, what the Professor on Gilligan's Island called, oddly enough, ""island madness."" Only in space. In the distant, distant future, a ship has been sent from the Earth carrying a lot of people, headed to the only Earth-like planet ever found. Sometime during the journey, things go awry. We pick up the story as an astronaut named Bower (Ben Foster) awakens from hypersleep, abruptly; he's soon followed by his commanding officer, Payton (Dennis Quaid). The rest of the crew is gone, and the only door is locked from the outside. What's happened here? Making matters more difficult is the amnesia that each man suffers from, owing to their having been in hypersleep way longer than intended. Somehow, they must piece together what has happened and find out what lies behind that door - and throughout the rest of the gigantic ship.Not only does the movie recall Aliens and 2001, you can also see similarities to The Descent and The Abyss; really, any movie in which people are trapped in claustrophobic environs. And although the pacing is frenetic at times, the movie is really chillingly shot (by Wedigo von Schultzendorff). On the one hand, the plot flows linearly - Bower needs to get to the ship's reactor so he can reboot it and save everyone - meaning that the actors race from scene to scene, running out of time. On the other hand, they don't piece together what's happened as quickly as they might in other, lesser films; they seem to figure things out gradually, as if assembling a puzzle in their heads. Bowers and others - and there are others - discover right away, though, that they're not really alone on the ship and that their enemies are extremely strong and fast and vicious.Injected into this oh-my-goodness-what's-out-there madness is, well, madness. The movie's title is explained as being a sort of mental illness that affects astronauts from time to time, when they just plain go bonkers for seemingly no reason and kill everyone on board. Is that's what's happening here? Is Bower the crazy one? Or is it Payton? Are they, in fact, alone on the ship? Foster is excellent as the hero who remembers a little bit more of their mission as time elapses; Quaid, in turn, shows a few more layers than we're accustomed to seeing from him (he's usually more of a poor man's Harrison Ford). Both actors turn in convincing, full-throated performances that complement, rather than succumb to, the special effects and cinematic wizardry. Often, the effects are the entire show. Now, it's true that you won't see a lot of character development here, as you might in the most cerebral of sci-fi, but what works best here is the paucity of knowledge about the situation and the characters. By spinning the tale gradually, feeding the audience only a snippet at a time, director Christian Alvart dangles the mystery in front of his viewers without allowing them to settle back and solve the mystery on their own. When you're constantly kept on your toes with sudden lurches of unseen shapes and reverberating noises, you - like the befuddled characters - are concurrently kept off balance. The result is an unsettling, entertaining delight.",Pandorum

But while the last survivors of our race wait in cryogenic storage for landfall, gruesome monsters have unexpectedly taken over the deck. This really had the makings of an entertaining little romp - not quite smart enough to be Alien, nor eccentric enough to be Event Horizon - but it falls flat on its face in the follow-through. It's color-by-numbers in all the worst ways, stealing liberally from dozens of sources and robbing them of the intangibles that made them worth taking in the first place. The dialog and acting are downright atrocious, equally pale impersonations of brighter pictures. Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sci-fi stinkbombs, takes the lead as one of the ship's off-kilter captains, and promptly hams it up with an awful Harrison Ford impression. Behind the scenes, the editing is aggressively irritating, confronting every tricky scene with so many jump cuts, I felt close to an epileptic seizure. Even the film's climactic twist, revealed like it were the mother of all mind-blowers, is telegraphed at least an hour earlier and whiffs like a kid at his first tee-ball practice. So much energy and enthusiasm, but nothing more to show for it than a gust of air and a loose sense of embarrassment.

50,MBunge,"Not bad, but nothing ever gets tied together.",6,10 January 2012,"Pandorum is a reasonably scary and exciting little sci-fi horror flick that offers up a surprising number of mysteries and conflicts. After a fun ride, though, it founders mightily at the end because nothing in this story is connected. There are questions answered and challenges overcome, but none of them are linked in any dramatic or thematic way. That doesn't ruin the film by any means. It looks good, moves at a nice clip, offers up some interesting monsters and relatively clever action scenes and gets a charismatic performance out of its lead actor. But the failure to weave its separate narrative strands into a single story keeps Pandorum from beings more than just okay.A man emerges from suspended animation on a space ship with no memory of who he is or why he's there. Bower (Ben Foster) is soon joined by Payton (Dennis Quaid), a similarly amnesiac astronaut, and they figure out they're part of the flight crew of a colony ship bound for the only Earth-like planet discovered in the galaxy. Unable to open the door to the bridge, Lieutenant Payton sends Corporal Bower into the access ducts to find a way to open it. What Bower discovers is a ship overrun with superhuman cannibals and a reactor core about to shut down. Rounding up 3 other crew members who emerged from hypersleep and have been living in a state of desperate survival for months, Bower has to avoid getting eaten and figure out who is the beautiful woman he sees in his fragmented memories. And hovering over it all is Pandorum, a space flight disorder that could send any of them spinning into paranoid insanity.Before I get to the major stuff, I have to deal with a couple of minor complaints. I can put up with the door that keeps Payton trapped being the only one on the entire ship that can't be opened manually. It's a pretty important plot point that doesn't make any sense, but I can overlook that because I understand the purpose of it. And I can put up with the exposition dump that comes, as it always does, when the movie is about two-thirds over. However, one of the other crew members encountered by Bower doesn't speak English and Bower doesn't speak his language. That may be one of the dumbest things I've encountered in any movie I've ever watched. Asking me to believe that a star ship is going to be crewed by people who speak different languages so they can't all communicate with each other is like asking me to believe the Moon is made of green cheese. It's not a significant detail and some draft of the screenplay may have included an explanation of and a point for it. As it stands, it's so awesomely stupid I wanted to make a note of it.With that, these filmmakers do a good job of putting a lot of balls in the air and keeping them there. There's Bower's internal struggle as he tries to fill in the gaps of his own mind. There's the fight between Bower and the other crew members who've put aside thoughts of cooperation under the demands of survival. There's the running battle between the humans and the monsters and the race to save the ship's reactor. And then they even throw in another argument at the end about the difference between insanity and a sane response to the worst possible situation. Pandorum gives you a lot of story to chew on.Then when it ends, you realizes you've had a lot of individual bites instead of a whole meal. Bowers' blanked memory doesn't have anything to do with the monsters, neither of them have anything to do with the state of the ship and none of that really has anything to do with the threat of Pandorum. The movie simply moves through the plot from beginning to end like you're walking a straight line. Because nothing is connected there are no real twists and no sense of rising tension or moments of revelation. The perfect example of that is when the humans figure out the secret behind the monster cannibals. There are some fascinating moral ramifications to that discovery which are instantly discarded so the story can just move on to the next thing. Nothing that happens in this film and nothing the characters or audience learns ever leads to anything else. Instead of A moving the plot to B and B sending things on to C, Pandorum goes AAA.That lack of coherent and directional structure results in Pandorum sputtering into a double ending. First, the whole cannibal monster issue is dealt with rather brusquely and then the motion picture essentially turns into the ""Space Madness"" episode of The Ren and Stimpy Show.I still liked this thing until its disappointing conclusion, but the more important the ending of a story is to you, the less you'll enjoy it. If you care more about the journey than the destination, give it a try.",Pandorum

I also enjoyed how this started out super confusing while the astronauts struggled to remember what their mission was and who the hell they were, taking the viewer long for the ride.

52,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Underrated sci fi horror gem,9,17 June 2015,"Christian Alvert's Pandorum is an overlooked sci fi gem that was largely unnoticed back in 2009. It is a smart, terrifying, surprisingly thought out space chiller that falls into the same sub genre as Dead Space, Doom and Event Horizon. Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster play two astronauts who wake up, amnesia stricken and traumatized in a gargantuan intergalactic space station, no memory of who they are or where they are going. As the space dementia syndrome called Pandorum ebbs and flows in their systems, they gradually discern their missions origins, what went wrong, and the terrifying resolution they must face if they are to pull through alive. The plot is a labyrinthine wonder of evolved nightmare mutants, dank deserted corridors and a desperate fight for survival and a new beginning. The atmosphere of sci fi horror films is the most important aspect, and Pandorum has an almost biblical, eerily mysterious implication of humanity starting anew in the farthest regions of space. It's a profound sense of high stakes, apocalyptic crisis that stays in your dreams long after the credits roll. Director Alvert, who made the brilliant, brutal serial killer flick Antibodies, works wonders here, creating a disorientating, clinically brutal special effects heavy juggernaut of a film. The spaceship feels real, the mysterious, primal beings who inhabit it look scarily organic, and are all the more freaky when we learn their origin (I won't spoil any secrets here.

53,rooprect,Alien + Psycho = fun!,7,10 March 2012,"This is a great scifi flick that falls into the awesome genre of ""being stuck on a big space thingy in the middle of nowhere"". Other notable films in the same genre are ""Alien"" (1979), ""Outland"" (1981), ""Moon"" (2009), Solaris (1972 or 2002) and of course the mack-daddy ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968). If you haven't already seen them, you should do that immediately.This movie has the same dark, claustrophobic style as ""Alien"" but with an interesting psychological twist thrown in. The title of the film, ""Pandorum"", refers to a type of madness that afflicts astronauts under emotional strain, and as you can guess, this makes things pretty interesting ...in addition to the bloodthirsty killers running around the ship eating peoples gallbladders out. Yeah that might catch your attention too.So there's quite a bit for you to sink your teeth into. If you like straightforward action, there's plenty of that. If you like psychological thrillers, there's a good bit of that, too. And, like a Hitchcock flick, there are just enough unexpected surprises to keep you guessing throughout.There are also some really interesting social/human themes introduced, such as: What happens to morality when there is no law? What is acceptable behavior when you're fighting to survive? And a very subtle yet poignant theme that the filmmakers touch upon: Is the human race even worth saving to begin with? On many different levels, this movie delivers. I also liked the fact that the special effects (cgi) weren't over the top. Instead, like ""Alien"", it uses darkness to force us to use our imagination. I think there were a few scenes that used stop-motion effects which really add a disturbing, old-school vibe to it.If, like me, you're a fan of classic scifi and a bit skeptical of the new stuff, have no fear. You won't be disappointed with ""Pandorum"".P.S. for you grasshopper fans, the grasshopper he eats is fake according to the disclaimer at the end of the movie. Pretty convincing though.

It can feel a bit familiar to other sci-fi films in a lot of small ways. The look and style of the film, the way it was shot, and the set- looks very much like Event Horizon- while other vibes of the films combine elements from films like Alien and Aliens. What it may lack in original style though, it certainly makes up for with its story and worldbuilding- giving the audience so much to work with its hard to not be in awe at the dedication to detail- no matter how little. The pacing can be a bit slow at times, but the film does remain interesting all the way through. The action can be a bit choppy in some scenes, but thankfully the film makes up for it in other moments. What I love most about the film though is the psychological nature of the crew, and the 'pandorum' that may be affecting them all. From a horror standpoint, it's always incredibly interesting to see the ill-minded be translated into film, especially when it is done well- and in a format like this- it provides endlessly interesting possibilities which I have to say was quite fascinating to watch. In the end, Pandorum- is far from perfect, but it still manages to be a very meticulously crafted sci-fi thriller and one of the most interesting horror flicks i've seen in some time.My Rating: 8.7/10.",Pandorum

Many tried to imitate, and Cameron even added more, hoping to expand on the mysterious creatures and their relentless drive to destroy and reproduce. It certainly brought to the surface the possibilities that aliens were certainly not all that friendly. In ""Pandorum"" the concept explodes, without getting out of control, as what is left of a crew begins to wonder what happened, and how such horrible and powerful creatures have taken over their spacecraft.""Panderum"" is much more than just a scary and beautiful piece of Science Fiction. It is a study in horror, in the type of horror that resides inside of our souls, our bodies, our understanding of what drives people to change, both physically and psychologically. It sounds like the film it is a boring retelling of the ""Alien"" mythology, but this one goes beyond because it provides the connection that didn't exist between the beast and humans,a theme that was addressed in ""Alien IV"", but in here the links are closer, and the implications are truly scary.It is set in the not so far future, and it opens with some veiled references to possible scenarios that could truly happen if we continue addressing ecological issues in our present ways. When the film gets going, and this happens fairly quick, the action begins, and the paranoia and horrors show themselves in both actions and imagery.Soon, we have humans running against the clock, trying to outsmart and outrun a new species of humanoids with much more in their minds than taking over the ship. They are intelligent enough to set traps and physically developed to appear almost invincible, but just like other Science Fiction classics have shown before; there might be more to fear from humans themselves, in their inability to trust and work together, and in, according to the storyline, their reactions to stressful forces, leading to some negative outcomes.Foster is sensational as the young man who believes in survival and is willing to face evil of the most unbelievable type. Then there is the fine performance by Quaid, as the dedicated officer that now must come face to face with a reality he might not like.The film is dark, oppressive, fast, and mean. It rarely stops for a breather, and when it does, is just for seconds before we are once again facing some horrific turn of events. Beautifully shot and edited, and directed with so much self-assurance, we can only hope the next feature will be as rewarding as this.",Pandorum
58,a_chinn,Good performances and production design can't save weak sci-fi/horror,4,14 July 2017,"Weak sci-fi thriller had potential in it's premise, that two spacemen (Ben Folds and Dennis Quaid) awaken from a very extended hyper-sleep and find themselves aboard a ship inhabited by primitive humans fighting to survive against strange mutant creatures. The story in many ways reminded me of H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"" with a man from the past waking up in the distant future to find primitive and naive humans at the mercy of monsters. Unfortunately, this film doesn't spend much time developing characters or story and instead focuses on action. There are attempts as suspense, but an over reliance on jump-scares over building suspense or atmosphere kills off any credibility. What is credible is some terrific production design and make- up effects, which along with strong performances by Folds and Quaid, were enough to hold my interest and hold out hope that the film was about to become good at any moment. Overall, this sci-fi/horror flick is a disappointment, so if you do plan to watch it, go in with low expectations and you may find it passable entertainment.",Pandorum
59,robertemerald,Solid scifi adventure,8,20 December 2018,"Pandora ticks just about all the boxes for a great blockbuster science fiction. Intelligent story, well plotted, good dialogue, interesting originality, magnificent attention to detail (the props and sets are superb), high quality cgi, fantastic actors well cast, excellent sound and intense tension throughout (really, throughout the whole show). I would really have loved to give it a 10 but I had to dock a point for the lighting and some of the editing, two aspects that are closely linked, and, because for a lot of the movie these factors are not working as well as they should, spoilt the overall enjoyment for me. Much of the movie is simply too dark. This was a problem for me in the second Anaconda movie, and also the second Alien vs Predator. I appreciate that in the interest of realism many will disagree with me. The darkness was after all part of the mechanics of the story. And then the editing, fast cuts and inserts, just added to the confusion. Too often one literally couldn't see what was going on and had to rely on the sound. Perhaps that was intentional. On a more positive note, Pandora has some of the best monster/baddies I've seen in that genre. The human side of space travel also drew positive comparisons to Event Horizon, another excellent blockbuster. And it was a really good length for a movie. If you're into collecting sci fi movies then this one is seemingly ageless and is an absolute must have.",Pandorum
60,Samiam3,Enjoyable but flawed,6,5 December 2010,"Pandoruum takes place on a mysterious vessel deep out in space, far from Earth in the year 2170. All the power has gone out, and the crew has just woken up from hyper sleep. They remember who they are but don't have a clue where they are, or who and what lies on the other side of the door which is locking them in. They come to realize that they have been sent on a mission to a distant world, but time is ticking to get the ship up and running again. Unless they do so, they may be lost in space forever.What I like about Pandorum is that it is always active and alive. For a while, it works effectively as a claustrophobic horror film in Alien style, as we get chased by unseen forces through some of the most dimly lit corridors I have ever seen. Things start to brighten up bit by bit, as the spaces get bigger and more complex more people are added to the frame, blood gets spilled more frequently and the game gets bigger and bigger. There are problems throughout the film (questionable acting, lack of story), but up to a certain point they are never quite big enough to do damage. It is around the climax when you start to feel the movie shaking. Basically the problem is simple, it looses control. A combination of heavy handed direction, and rushed sequencing take the viewer out of the film, as we become aware of the sheer clumsiness. I can recommend Pandorum but not without warning. Despite its best attempts, it remains unoriginal, and it feels a little too overdone to pass for a good film, but at least it's enjoyable.",Pandorum

Two astros wake up from deep sleep on a ship, and they have no memory of their mission. We are made aware right from the start they are on a ship loaded with colonists headed for an Earth-like planet. Once they get semi-oriented to their surroundings, the main problem is to get the ship's nuclear reactor restarted before the ship goes completely kaput. Ben Foster (Angel from THE X-MEN movies) goes off to deal with the reactor and runs into several other survivors as well as cannibalistic creatures that apparently were once humans. Dennis Quaid, who not too many years ago would have played Foster's role, stays above decks as the ship's commander. Quaid is in the movie for name value, pure and simple. Most of the movie is shot in darkness or semidarkness, which makes it very hard to watch. It also goes on too long. We kind of know where it's going, having seen all of this before.

Some explanations are vague while character motivations are unclear. I liked the premise and overarching lineage of the story - perhaps the movie could've done better with incorporating more history up front. (Spoiler) The Dennis Quaid character seemed more or less a gimmick - by trying to make him less conventional - the story doesn't focus enough on development.

In time they discover they are not alone. This would have had more positive impact if the audio, when the characters were speaking, was better. Can we blame it on a bad DVD? Hmmmmm.. No. Also too many scenes, let's say 98% of the movie was shot in the dark and a lot of things can be covered up with darkness. Very hard to see what was going on. Yes, there are others on the ship with our heroes, but 98% of the movie was watching these half dead, zombie-looking types try to kill them. Quite annoying 98% of the time. This is not a good Sci Fi movie. Actually, I wouldn't call it a Sci Fi movie. It's more of an annoying horror movie. I will say the fight scenes were very good. Kudos. But 98% of the movie were the fight scenes. Too many. Also, the horror aspect loses its effect when the fight scenes come almost non-stop. Now, if you know what Pandorum means you have a leg up on one of the twists you will see at the end if you stay with this. One of my main beefs with some movies is the introduction of imaginary friends. Enough said. To help you out they do explain what Pandorum means several times. There is another twist that no one could possibly have seen coming. If you are one of the ones who will see this coming, get an agent and book yourself on a psychic tour. You will make a lot of money. I can't fault the acting. It was all good. It's just that 98% of the movie was fighting in the dark. See? Very annoying. Go see Alien again, and again and again.

(R)On an ark-like spaceship carrying settlers to a distant Earth-like planet, crew members Foster and Quaid awaken from deep sleep with partial amnesia, but it's gosh darn tough for them to figure things out when a horde of inhuman cannibals are running around the dilapidated vessel; the ""pandorum"" of its title is just a fancy way to describe, as Ren Höek would say, ""space madness."" Starts with introductory text explaining that Earth's population has ballooned to over 24 billion in the 22nd century (out on a limb here: unsustainable), jumps to a feverish closeup of Foster's bulging eyes, and away we go! Dour, derivative sci-fi/horror takes too long to get to its payoff points, leaving the audience in the company of characters that are untrustworthy because of their fragmented memories and aren't developed enough to be sympathetic; worse, the action/attack scenes are edited with such spastic, thrashing fervor that they're nearly impossible to follow (dim lighting in nearly every scene doesn't help). This leaves one with plenty of time to ponder background elements--such as why the designers chose such a hacky industrial-futurist typeface for every printed word on the ship--until everything finally comes together in the last half hour.

It also has the ""you dont give me what i want"" Ben Foster from 30 Days Of Night so has a full feature cast.It has it all - the sheer terror of Aliens, a real sense of dread so palpable it made my heart race and a great story played out with almost perfect pacing and an excellent reveal at the end just topped the movie off - I have just watched it again for the 7th time and spotted new things I had not noticed in the first 6 viewings - that adds up to a truly superb movie for me.

Remind you of anything? Thought so.The first guy who wakes up is Bower, played by Ben Foster, who I have seen in other films and who possessed the same awkward ugliness/attractiveness that Owen Wilson and Giovanni Ribisi share.That is probably not on any of their CVs by the way.The second guy is Payton, Lt Payton, played by Dennis Quaid, whose surname always sounded better as delivered by Quarto from Total Recall: ""Quaaayyyyed"".Disoriented, confused and alone, Bower gets no early answers, so he goes looking around, apparently his search precedes Payton's awakening by about an hour - and together they agree to find out what the hell is going on.The early scenes are quite effective, as the unseen potential menace is somewhat more scary and freaky than the Beyond Thunderdome enemies that actually appear later. As Bower crawls through the dark recesses trying to move around the ship there is a distinct The Descent vibe, which is generally a good thing in my opinion.After a while Bower gets through to the main ship area, where he finds other survivors, which is both good and bad. Good as one of the early meetings involves a fit looking chick with shiny cleavage that might as well have an arrow pointing at it, bad when the cannibalistic spiky, Descent-esquire, Skekksi-ish guys show up to nibble.So with this new information onboard Payton becomes Bower's personal Nav-Man, leading him through the terrain to try to get to a place where he can control the ship. As this goes along both of them start getting flashbacks of previous events to their hypersleep, some of them disturbing, some not so bad.Bower comes across a few inhabitants, again some nice and some nasty, but after a while a compact unit of Bower, the shiny-cleavage girl and a Grunty No-Speaky guy forms.Also to give Payton something to do in the film aside from waiting for the credits another crew member shows up, the naked, greasy Cpl Gallow.So our three-person team of goodies finally gets to fight one of the ""things"" 3:1, and find that they are virtually indestructible even with a personnel advantage and various weapons on hand.Without going further similarities to Event Horizon continue cropping up, most notably in the final 10 minutes, and the ending is a little cheesy.Certain characters and circumstances veer dangerously into ludicrous territory, and even when you know the full story certain parts are hard to stomach.Final Rating - 7 / 10.

The movie wastes no time in offering a where am I episode which the viewer wonders as well. We are off to a good start. We travel with the character who is exploring but we are too and questions just fill the air making this a tense adventure taking place live and the viewer has a front seat. Then, the stories unfold many of them and it is like a puzzle coming together soon enough to form an explanation that takes us to a boggle frame of mind. But wait, it doesn't end there and off we go and go. Seat belts recommended as well as a tasty drink with a snack to keep your fingers away from your mouth (nail-biting) to ease tension. The next stop in this movie is one you don't see coming followed by another. At this point, the viewer is in a state of blissful sci-fi addiction and what follows is a delightful ending where we can only imagine positively what comes next. What a great place to leave the viewer too. I am surprised this didn't do better in the box office. It has everything one would want in todays viewing world.

69,MrGKB,"Smarter than many, but still lacking something...",6,30 January 2010,"...despite director Christian ""I'm still a newby!"" Alvart's best intentions, ""Pandorum"" is one of those sci-fi films that requires the viewer to exercise her brain a bit, and that undoubtedly hurt its box office even more than the lack of an A-list actor in the cast. Not to say that the acting is bad; it isn't. Young actors like Ben ""30 Days of Night"" Foster and Cam ""Twilight"" Gigandet acquit themselves well, and even Dennis ""Enemy Mine"" Quaid contributes on more than a paycheck-taking basis. German newcomer Antje Traue shows promise as well. In addition, the production values are, for the most part, up to snuff. DP Wedigo ""The Thirteenth Floor"" Schultzendorff, production designer Richard ""Resident Evil"" Bridgland, art directors Cornelia ""Valkyrie"" Ott and Ralf ""me, too!"" Schreck, and sfx from Stan ""The Man"" Winston Studio and German-based Chris Creatures all contribute to a mostly seamless vision that owes a great debt to the ""Alien"" franchise, among others. The ""monsters"" remind one a bit too much of the CGI gumbies from ""I Am Legend,"" but this is a small complaint. No, it's mostly the script that keeps ""Pandorum"" confined to the ranks of also-rans, along with Alvart's penchant for strobe-like editing that makes most of the action/fight sequences a confusing mish-mash.As I said, it's mostly the script that bogs ""Pandorum"" down. The premise is intriguing enough: two crewman awake from ""hypersleep"" to find themselves aboard the Elysium, a massive spacecraft that they soon discover is headed for a habitable planet some 40-odd light years from Earth. Despite initial memory lapses, they manage to realize the nature of their situation and their prospective roles in righting things that have gone wrong, and set out to do just that. Complications ensue as they encounter various others on the ship, including the aforementioned ""monsters,"" a number of awakened sleepers with various agendas, and a few hallucinations just to keep things twitchy. Everything is resolved ""happily ever after,"" but the final plot revelations tax suspension of disbelief past the breaking point.Massive spoiler: we're supposed to accept that this gigantic ""generational"" spacecraft has managed to land itself intact beneath the ocean surface of the target planet, Tanis. I found that utterly impossible to believe, and it completely invalidated everything that had come before. Ymmv.Upshot: worth a watch for the eyecandy and for Foster fans, but little else.

70,fwomp,Parts Make Pandorum Better Than You'd Think,8,28 February 2010,"Part psychological thriller, part sci-fi, part ALIENS, PANDORUM is a unique hybrid. Although nothing new in terms of things we haven't seen before (encapsulate a group of men/women and see how they react), the film is strung together differently enough to hold your attention. You never really know what's around the next corner.The story is pretty common: Earth is doomed. Spaceships are sent out to find a habitable planet. One of these ships has been lost in space for some time, and when ship's pilot #4, Bower (Ben Foster, 3:10 TO YUMA), wakes up from a prolonged hyper-sleep, much of his memory is gone or scrambled. Slowly things begin coming into focus as he finds various clues about who and where he's at. And not long after his awakening, another pod opens up and spills out Payton (Dennis Quaid, VANTAGE POINT), a high ranking officer who's memory is just as screwed up.Bower is chosen to explore the ship, and getting out of their pod chamber is the first challenge since they're locked in for unknown reasons. Like giving birth, Bower squeezes through the canals of the ship's innards and is expelled onto what appears to be a dead ship. But he quickly runs into friends and foes. Some of the crew, it appears, have mutated and are cannibalistic. Others have had to do terrible things in order to fight and survive. All Bower wants to do is reactivate the ship's power systems and get to the bridge.And that's about as far as I want to go without producing any spoilers....There are several ""jump-in-your-seat"" moments that'll surprise the hell out of most viewers. And the darkness of the cold ship makes for some excellent atmosphere. The sound score also added a spooky quality to the production.Ben Foster has rarely let me down in his choice of roles, and Pandorum was no exception. His embattled and continually challenged character was pitched just right throughout the film. It was also one of the first times I'd seen him as a main character and I was pleased to see it. He's a great young actor.And I've saved the best for last: the filming. It was pretty amazing. Again, the dark qualities and claustrophobic shots were pulled off without feeling forced or contrived (something I can't say of all films ...like THE DESCENT).Surprisingly this film got poor reviews and pretty much flopped at the box office (costing over $40 million to make but only grossing $10 million).

If I was going to be harsh, which I'm not, I'd say that it's little more than a remix of various ideas borrowed from science fiction dating back to at least H.G. Welles; however, that's not fair, since pretty much all art is actually derivative and builds on the past. Lots of recipes use the same ingredients, but some taste better than others. Like most of the best science fiction movies, at least in my opinion, a solid story line can more than compensate for an average budget and decent but not spectacular special effects. As far as I'm concerned, far too many movies, including the genres of sci-fi and horror, skate by mostly on their special effects, to which I've become totally jaded. With modern computers and a big budget, everybody and their grandma has special effects nowadays. On the other hand, ""Pandorum"" really grabbed me hard right away and creeped me out to the bitter end, even though it's budget was obviously relatively modest. On the downside, I'm not sure that I'm going to sleep well tonight, given that it's really late, and I just finished watching it. I wouldn't recommend this film for pleasant dreams.

But while the last survivors of our race wait in cryogenic storage for landfall, gruesome monsters have unexpectedly taken over the deck. This really had the makings of an entertaining little romp - not quite smart enough to be Alien, nor eccentric enough to be Event Horizon - but it falls flat on its face in the follow-through. It's color-by-numbers in all the worst ways, stealing liberally from dozens of sources and robbing them of the intangibles that made them worth taking in the first place. The dialog and acting are downright atrocious, equally pale impersonations of brighter pictures. Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sci-fi stinkbombs, takes the lead as one of the ship's off-kilter captains, and promptly hams it up with an awful Harrison Ford impression. Behind the scenes, the editing is aggressively irritating, confronting every tricky scene with so many jump cuts, I felt close to an epileptic seizure. Even the film's climactic twist, revealed like it were the mother of all mind-blowers, is telegraphed at least an hour earlier and whiffs like a kid at his first tee-ball practice.

74,ajs-10,Better than expected...,6,28 November 2010,"I wanted to see this when it came out last year but was put off by the lacklustre reception it got. I fortunately recently got hold of a copy of the DVD and so, after a short summary, I'll give you my take on Pandorum. (Summary haters please remain in cryo-stasis until after the summary thank you).In a future Earth population gets out of control. Resources cannot meet demand and it's all going to hell. An Earth-like planet called Tanis has been discovered and a massive ship, Elysium, is sent out to colonise this planet. At some point, long after launch, Bower is woken in his hyper-sleep pod. Disorientated, he finds his locker and very slowly things come back to him. He is part of the ship's crew that cycle through; he is part of team five. One of his colleagues, Cooper, has already woken and is missing and the ship's power is fluctuating dangerously. Later, his Lieutenant, Payton, is brought out of hyper-sleep. Unable to open the door to the bridge, Bower crawls up into the air-conditioning ducting in order to find a way out, he must get to the reactor core in order to re-set it. Once out, he discovers that he is not alone on the ship, and not all those he meets are friendly or even human I think that's enough of a summary for now.This is a pretty well made film with some interesting ideas as far as technology goes. I love the fact that each instrument, or weapon, has the means to be powered manually, at least for a short while. Decent performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; Dennis Quaid as Payton, Ben Foster as Bower, Cam Gigandet as Gallow, Antje Traue as Nadia and Cung Le as Manh.Over all, although it's not going to win any prizes for originality, I quite liked this film. There's lots of running around in the dark, some really bad-ass bad guys and a pretty good plot to tie it all together. There are a couple of points where it does get a little bogged down, but it's still worth a viewing (IMO). Oh, what's Pandorum? Well, it's a form of madness caused by being in space alone too long...

You can relate to the main character since you are as eager to know what is going on as he is.And while the film gives you an interesting take on exploration and colonization, character and plot inconsistencies is what drags this movie down a little. It feels like the writer was a little inexperienced or had too many ideas he wanted to implement. This starts to show in the third act.I do recommend you to see this at least once.

Oh, you can hear so many groans, gasps, howls, grunts, growls, hisses etc etc, there's not much need of dialog.

Wow, how original, eh? The best part is watching the stunt men go through their paces - at least they put out a lot of effort to make up for the lame story.Don't bother to see it. I wasted my time.

The monster design is pretty good and the atmosphere is quite haunting, while the only surviving crew members, those awake at least, are almost insane from solitude and terror caused by the monsters.Acting is all around good, Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster do a solid work with their characters, while the couple of other rare characters are left in the background.

79,ersinkdotcom,Interesting sci-fi horror flick with pretty good story,8,25 September 2009,"I just never know what to expect from horror / sci-fi films. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. I can't think of too many times where it didn't work. I guess there's Supernova, Doom, Virus, John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, and other films like that. But there's also the Alien movies, the first Species, Pitch Black, Event Horizon, and even the Resident Evil movies that hit the nail on the head. I would have to say Pandorum does a pretty decent job of hammering it down.Pandorum is loud, noisy, and has more gore than I think most ""regular"" moviegoers are probably used to. That being said, it also strives to be intelligent and arty. It's kind of a strange mix. It melds together elements of such films as Event Horizon, Alien, Resident Evil, and even The Poseidon Adventure. I mean, the whole film is about a guy trying to reach the reactor of the ship to turn it back on. Just imagine Gene Hackman (or Kurt Russell, if you've only seen the remake Poseidon) and company trying to get off the ship before it breaks apart...but they're being chased by cannibalistic monsters that seem to have superhuman strength and speed.The acting in the film for the most part is pretty decent. Dennis Quaid comes off kind of cheesy a few times and some of the dialogue for the other characters could have been spruced up a bit. There's really nothing to cry about, though. I was kind of excited to see that Norman Reedus (The Boondock Saints, Blade II, Deuces Wild, Gossip, Messengers 2: The Scarecrow) was in this, but was disappointed when his character gets dragged off a mere five minutes after he hits the screen.The special effects and cinematography were very stylistic. The scene of the ""mutant"" cannibal lair where they're all piled on each other and intertwined was reminiscent of the scene in Alien Resurrection where Ripley is lying with all the Aliens in their lair. Now imagine having to crawl through them covered in their skin to get to where you need to go. Yes, it is pretty nerve-wracking and disturbing. The ferocious way the ""mutants"" run, attack, and eat their prey is also a big visual highlight.You can tell that the writer of this film really did try to do something intelligent and new, while treading on some familiar ground. There's a pretty decent story lying under all the visual hocus-pocus and gore. I actually liked the end (one of them, at least), even though I could see it coming a mile away. I wanted to write that I didn't like it, but I just can't. It worked so well within the frame of the story.Is Pandorum a groundbreaking film? No. Is it going to shock genre fans and be the next big thing? No. Is it a good movie that entertains, but at the same time doesn't dumb anything down story wise for action and gore? Yes. Like I said earlier, your ""normal"" Friday night movie-going audience will probably find it more shocking and gory than us genre gore hounds. It was still a good watch.",Pandorum
80,Darkside-Reviewer,Gritty Dark and Claustrophobic,6,21 November 2019,This 2009 science fiction horror comes from the producers of the Resident Evil movies that includes Paul WS Anderson which put me off this movie initially as I don't much enjoy Andersons work but I recently watched Pandorum on Blu Ray and surprisingly it's not a bad movie certainly nothing new in terms of story ideas and space themed horror movies but for a low budget horror movie its worth watching and it certainly entertains.The movie follows two flight crew members who awaken from Hypersleep to find themselves with no memory of who they are or where they are just the names on there Hypersleep pods Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid) they find they are trapped in a room running on low power the doors locked and the only way out is via a ventilation system Bowers volunteer's to explore while Payton uses a computer to guide him but Bowers soon discovers they are aboard the space ship Elysium the last ship to leave earth for a new world before it was destroyed its cargo is the last of humanity and they are meant to be part of the flight crew that awakens to take over from the previous crew on there 126 year flight to a new planet but something has gone very wrong while they were asleep the crew are missing the ships reactor is in the final stages of shutting down and what remains of those on-board the ship have evolved to survive in the ships dark closrophobic and cold environment and have become disfigured cannibal creatures who will eat anything or anyone they find alive Bowers must reach the reactor in time and avoid being the next meal for the cannibals.The movie is well shot and directed and takes place in a dark atmospheric and claustrophobic environment which creates tension and panic when there's little room to escape the clutches of the savage cannibals and no light to guide Bowers through the ship having him rely on quietly navigating the ship making as little noise as possible.The acting from all involved is excellent and the movie even has a very brief cameo by Norman Reedus as a surviving crew member where he gets killed by the cannibals which is fun to see.I recommend watching this movie if you enjoy science fiction and horror movies while nothing special or groundbreaking it still deserves a watch and will definitely entertain for an hour and half.,Pandorum
81,anselmdaniel,Thrilling,8,13 March 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Pandorum is a 2009 science-fiction horror movie that is directed by Christian Alvart. The story is written by Travis Milloy, and Christian Alvart. The movie stars Dennis Quaid, and Ben Foster. In the future when overpopulation has depleted the Earth's resources, an expedition to a habitable world is dispatched. During this mission, the crew awaken to a derelict ship and must piece together the mystery.Pandorum's opening is incredibly solid. The introduction and explanations behind the interstellar ark are captivating. These explanations go into grim subjects such as mental health in a confined area and in isolation. These concepts are thoroughly explored by the movie and it seeks to shed light on these topics in an interesting way. The movie does its best when it is exploring these human concepts in a science-fiction setting. The mood and atmosphere of the movie is incredibly solid in the first two-thirds of the movie.The creepiness of the derelict ship can be felt by the audience in a meaningful way. From the beginning of the movie, the audience can see how dangerous the ship is. The mystery and prevailing insanity of the crew permeates in the movie. This makes for a great experience as the audience has only the context of the characters present.The movie fails later in its reveals. Once it is revealed that one of the characters has originally gone insane, the story loses its charm. I felt like the characters were merely fleeing from the insanity. It felt less of a mystery and more of a chase movie which the movie does not do as great of a job as it did earlier. The tonal shift became harder to take as the movie did not have the brutal atmosphere earlier.I would recommend ""Pandorum"".Grade: C",Pandorum

84,dfa120374,A Really Good Sci Fi Space Adventure,7,19 January 2015,"2174. The Earth has become vastly overpopulated and food & water have become exceedingly scarce. The spaceship Elysium is launched carrying 60,000 passengers and crew; it's destination - a distant Earth-like planet called Tanis which was discovered 21 years prior. On route to Tanis, two crew members - Cpl. Bower & Lt. Payton - awaken from hypersleep, but at first have limited memory on where they are, why they're there, and where they're headed. Seemingly the only ones on the ship, and with their memory gradually returning, they soon find out the ship's nuclear reactor is malfunctioning, so Bower sets off to reset the system while Payton stays on the Bridge. However, not long after he sets off, he realises he & Payton are not the only ones on the ship....and the inhabitants are most definitely not other passengers or crew members.If you love films like Event Horizon, Alien, and Prometheus then you will enjoy Pandorum. It even has a slight Descent feel to it. Pandorum is a very dark, sinister movie which is exactly the way a good Sci-Fi space movie should be. None of this Star Trek crap.The pace is really good and it's not like an hour of ""story & character development"" then only 30 minutes of minimum action. It doesn't take long to get going at all and when it does, it doesn't let up very much. I mean there's obviously slower moments, but they are never dull or boring so the story still ticks along nicely even during these periods.The look & feel of the movie created a really creepy, dark atmosphere, and when the ""aliens"" are brought into it, the tension rating also goes up. If you're after plenty of gore then move along as you won't find it here, and this is another movie that proves you don't need buckets of blood to enhance the scare factor.Oh, just a quick note...pay attention to the film as well because if you don't then you probably won't understand the ending.

The plot isn't horribly original, which isn't a bad thing. The idea of monsters on a dark spaceship is a good one, as demonstrated by movies like Alien. The Pandorum itself is a really interesting plot device though, which really adds to the movie. The ending was awesome too.The characters are pretty average. Nothing exceptional if you ask me, but I still cared enough about them to want to watch the movie. The movie overall is just really epic. Lot's of running, some fighting, it's all very fun to watch, and sometimes pretty tense. Unfortunately the movie was pretty dumb at some points, specifically one part at the end. But it didn't take away from the movie that much. Overall Pandorum is pretty great. The plot is interesting, and it's just a whole lot of fun. With the exception of a few minor parts, this was all around just a really enjoyable movie in my eyes. I really don't understand why people (specifically the critics) hated it so much, you've gotta admit it was at least fun to watch, which has to count for something. In the end I would certainly recommend Pandorum.",Pandorum

88,ebeckstr-1,Poor plotting ultimately ruins it,5,25 July 2020,"Pandorum had a lot going for it, including a good cast, solid CG, very good set design and particularly good set decoration.The main shortcoming of this movie, and its undoing, is poor plotting, which is also reflected in poor editing choices. Way too early on in the movie too much is given away through flashbacks, and at various points too much is revealed through explaining rather than showing. Both of these fatal mistakes represent a huge missed opportunity to create a sense of mystery and foreboding. We are essentially told the answers to the biggest mysteries in the first 30 minutes (or, anyway, what could have been effective mysteries in the hands of a better writer). It's remarkable that the scriptwriter gave away so much information so early on instead of letting it play out. One of the negative results of this poor information management is that the ending of the movie isn't a surprise; the Big Reveal reveals nothing much at all that we didn't already know.In addition, yet again we have a strong female character who must be saved by the man. And yet again we have a stupid final scene which is not at all in keeping with the tone or story of the rest of the movie.Furthermore, the score, while not bad (though nothing special) throughout most of the movie, has moments of jarring electric guitar which simply do not fit with the tone of the movie, and make no sense within the style of the rest of the score.I know a lot of people like this movie, and I wanted to because it's clear that a lot of effort went into certain aspects of it, and it does hold a certain amount of tension and suspense; but it fails on too many fundamental levels.",Pandorum
89,nitzanhavoc,Dead Space meets Alien - and the outcome is great!,7,24 December 2012,"One of the best things about being an open-minded Horror fan, is that I get to watch many films from different sub-genres, and some of them are really disappointing. Due to that, my expectations have been drastically lowered in the past few days, and I was very pleasantly surprised with how much fun Pandorum was.It's not easy making a Space-Horror film, and rather than trying to be groundbreaking and innovative, Pandorum decided to use the familiar tricks, but use them wisely (a mission to find and alternate planet, spaceship malfunction, evil aliens). Attaching some other Horror/Thriller aspects (memory loss leading to twists and new revelations) was also a good call, and the complete product turned out to be a very nice film.After the short exposition (the build up this time took place alongside the plot rather that the exposition) the film felt very much like a Dead Space tribute, which was really nice! Everything I loved about the game was here in this film, so I might not be too objective, but I enjoyed every minute!The screenplay is nice and smart, the acting is great and the cinematography is just as it should be. I find it hard to find anything wrong! Objectively, I guess the story could have been better and the ""bad guys"" could have been made better and scarier. Also, some of the things could have used a bigger touch of ""Horror"" motives. Then again, finding the delicate balance between Action and Horror (especially in a Sci-Fi film) is a real challenge.All in all, if you've ever played Dead Space, or if you enjoyed Alien and such films - you really have to watch this!",Pandorum

91,p-jonsson,Surprisingly good sci-fi / horror movie,7,7 April 2015,"I was positively surprised by this movie. I would not say that it is a great movie but it is definitely worth watching. The movie plays on the classical horror elements with its dark and claustrophobic setting, horrific things that go bump in the dark and some rather psychopathic behavior for added flavor.I would say that the story is somewhat original. Sure if you take each element of the story individually then most of them have been done before but the way they are tied together and with the additional twists I would say that the story did indeed surprise me somewhat.I cannot say that the movie kept me on the edge by its horror qualities but then, after having seen enough various horror movies you kind of get too used to them to be scared anymore. It has its share of nasty creatures and some blood splatter to go with them. The monsters, the effects and the dark and gritty scenery works quite well although some of the areas of the ship seemed to be designed more for cinematic effect than having any logical or practical purpose on a spaceship.It is somewhat difficult to write a review of this movie because much of it qualities and originality lies in the various twists, some predictable and some less so, in the story and a spoiler would definitely ruin this movie.The acting is on par with the movie. Not great but decent enough. Both Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster performed their roles quite well.As I wrote above, definitely a movie worth watching, preferably sometime after the sun has set and the younger kids have gone to bed.",Pandorum
92,xamtaro,"Untapped potential leaves ""Pandorum"" a dark, claustrophobic, unoriginal mess which at least manages to be passably entertaining",7,19 January 2010,"Science Fiction horror has more or less come to a standstill. Seriously, how many times can you retell a story involving people getting killed off on a dark foreboding spaceship? Pandorum is not spared that ""unoriginal"" stereotype that has plagued so many films in this genre ever since Ridley Scott's ""Alien"".Simply put, Pandorum is ""Event Horizon"" meets ""Resident Evil""(surprise surprise, the producers DID make both those films) by way of ""I Am Legend"". In deep space, on board the colony vessel Elysium, astronauts Bower and Payton are awoken from hyper-sleep only to be confronted with a dark empty room, signs of struggle, irregular power surges and the mysterious disappearance of the other crew members. Suffering from mild memory loss, Bower volunteers to journey deep into the bowels of the ship and restore power at the main reactor so that they can access the main bridge while Payton guides him over the radio. Along the way, Payton tells Bower of ""Pandorum"" which is a psychological condition brought about by intense emotional reaction after long periods of suspended animation. Symptoms include hallucinations, paranoia and even homicidal tendencies. No sooner has this been said, Bower gets thrust into a nightmare of claustrophobic vents, hellish cannibalistic creatures and other human survivors who have ""gone native"". Payton too has to deal with his discovery of a stowaway, Gallo, who may hold the answers to the all that is happening on the ship.Amniesic protagonist, someone with a hidden past and agenda, kick butt warrior woman, blood thirsty mutants, hell on a spaceship.... all highly familiar to anyone who has at least heard of the science fiction horror sub-genre. Plot holes, erratic pacing and confusing back-story aside, The worst part is that Pandorum had so much wasted potential to address more complex issues of the human psychological nature; perhaps by expanding on the whole ""Pandorum syndrome"" concept and giving a more ambiguous nature to the horrors faced by the protagonists so that we would not know if they were real or were merely hallucinations brought on by the Pandorum symptoms. There is even a part about one man ""having his way"" with the other sleeping crew as he succumbs to the loneliness of deep space travel; again a lot of potential for expansion into a parable about human nature but in the end, merely left as a passing anecdote. Thankfully, the film makes up for its narrative shortcomings thanks to, the director's eye for style and detail. Christian Alvart excels at conveying the same sense of fear and hysteria experienced by Bower through effective cinematography and tight close-up shots. His camera-work never fails highlight the production design of the Elysium's interior which is both spectacular and menacing to behold, as if the ship itself had mutated along with the creatures residing in its bowels. The decision to let the whole mystery be played out slowly as the astronauts try to piece together what transpired on the Elysium works after a while and manages to maintain a chilling air of suspense right up to the big twist.Both Ben foster and Dennis Quaid who play the two astronauts manage to put on a convincing and multi layered performance with ""New Moon""'s Cam Gigandet stealing the show as a man slowly going over the deep end. Such rich characters are a rarity in horror movies nowadays. With so many films falling back on the usual stock one-dimensional ones, this is a refreshing change. While suspenseful, Pandorum is severely hampered by its lack of actual scares and indecisiveness as to whether it should be a horror show or action movie. Long time sci/fi fans will know what to expect and will most likely be let down, but hopefully this film can entice newcomers to the genre who would then go on to check out some of the better sci/fi horror films. While it is a decent attempt at reinvigorating the waning science fiction horror sub-genre, Pandorum suffocates under the reputation of its predecessors and its derivative elements. Ultimately, like some lost vessel drifting in space, it would disappears into darkness or at least garner a small cult following.",Pandorum

Travis Milloy and Christian Alvart did a really good job in writing this story, keeping the audience on the verge until the very end. The film takes a lot of inspiration from pop culture, such as ""Alien"" and the videogame ""Dead Space"" for its claustrophobic locations, monsters reminded me a lot of the ones in ""The Descent"", and their metal armors and rudimental weapons, brings back my memory to ""Mad Max"". The movie just managed to take the best from each production, creating a balanced mix. Action sequences are well directed, very dynamic and brutally violent.Unfortunately there is a complete lack of tension. 20 minutes in and the director already gave away its monsters, instead of gradually building up and then revealing them with a shocker scene. This ruined the first act. I did not feel any fear for the characters, because the threat was revealed almost instantly in its full form. What the movie did right however, was to show the physical strength of these creatures that will constantly stop the spaceship crew in accomplishing their main objective. So once the mission is finally done, you feel that they really earned it, as they outsmarted them as a team. There is no glorified hero that saved everyone. I really liked this choice and I think that makes the film more human.The cast did a decent job. Cannot really say that I was impressed by any performance. There are Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid, but they were not very convincing, something was definitely off and I know that they both could do better than that, considering the given material.

95,Danny_G13,Solid horror thriller,7,15 February 2010,"Dark sci fi thriller with overtones of horror and psychology might not be original, but entertains.As you may have picked up from the blurb, Pandorum is set in space like Event Horizon, and is a similar sci fi horror style to that Sam Neill flick, but features a number of people waking up aboard a space ship with no recollection of their mission, their objectives, the date or their location.Suffice to say Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster spend the rest of the movie trying to figure this out and how to save themselves.Pandorum is not a truly great movie - the dialogue is very muffled at times, caused by substandard audio capture in the first place, and the majority of the location is almost pure darkness - certainly a good test for blu ray but not your patience.But what it lacks in certain areas, it makes up for in being basically entertaining. The viewer WANTS to know what has happened to this mission, wants to know where they are, and wants to know who everyone really is - to that extent it's a decent story and it's quite well told.What it lacks are the production styles and cinematography - too much incoherent darkness with fast cameras and a lack of easy identification of what's going on.There is also a niggly feeling of miscasting - neither Quaid nor Foster suit their roles. They're not awful, but they don't appear comfortable. Cam Gigandet is the only one who is half decent and that's quite worrying given he's alongside 2 major players in the Hollywood scene while he's still relatively minor.Nevertheless, for its faults, it's a basic and simple yarn - bread and butter entertainment and worthy of a watch.

Maybe I'm seeing connections that aren't there, but I'm sure that if you haven't seen all four of the titles I just named, Pandorum will seem a whole lot fresher to you.Still, I can't really fault the movie too much since I loved the movies (and TV show) that seemingly inspired it.

I could not hate that more in films, and frankly so do all my neighbors...I think it was good, but without seeing or hearing it, it can't be rated as anything more than mediocre. So maybe the following is explained, but I missed it due to the darkness and volume issues: What was up with the monsters? What were they? Where did they come from?

100,Quebec_Dragon,Pandorum pandemonium,6,7 October 2009,"It starts very well with the most memorable unerving sequence of the film : a man waking up in some kind of cryogenic tube inside a spaceship. He's lost, alone and doesn't remember who he is and what he's doing there. Despite a strong start, Pandorum, although fairly good, does not impress enough to become a classic. For fright, it relies mostly on jump scares accompanied by loud sound effects. It's also rather claustrophobic since it takes place almost entirely inside with very little light except that provided by glow-in-the-dark sticks. That gives us some nifty neon colors in the dark although the lighting in general didn't strike me as particularly well done. The story, once it gets moving, is rather simple with a clear cut objective that we are constantly reminded of. What's more interesting is the mystery surrounding the Pandorum, the ship and what happened to its people.The main character (Ben Foster) was decent but not outstanding. I liked the psychological tension taking place between Dennis Quaid's character and the second guy he encounters, especially its clever denouement. As for the secondary characters, I'm afraid I did not care very much for them because they weren't really developed. One of them looked pretty enough but I kinda missed actresses of the quality of Sigourney Weaver or Mila Jovovitch who emote so much better. Action-wise, it was OK but not great. You can expect the usual quick cuts and closed-in shaky camera so prevalent these days. If you're looking for claustrophobic sci-fi horror in the vein of Event Horizon, Alien or the Descent, you could do worse. I think I might have enjoyed more the mystery aspects than the horror aspects though and Pandorum is not as good as the titles mentioned above.Rating: 6 out of 10",Pandorum
101,tburke85,Pandorum Is A Decent Sci-Fi Horror Thriller With Some Flaws,7,22 January 2010,"Pandorum is a decent sci-fi horror thriller with some flaws from director Christian Alvert whose admirable in making this movie despite it's few problems. The film is about two crew members who awaken aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft with no memory only to discover that the worst has yet to come. Ben Foster turns in a good performance as Corporal Bower who ventures deep into the ship when he discovers a terrifying truth. Dennis Quaid is fine as Lieutenant Payton who stays behind to guide Bower via radio transmitter. Quaid doesn't have much to do until late into the third act however and he sits out action wise for most of the movie leaving that work to Foster whose traveling through the ship while trying to outrun deadly cannibalistic mutants that have taken over their spacecraft. Foster actually felt more like the lead since most of the focus seemed to be on him but Quaid is still solid in his supporting role. The rest of the relatively unknown cast are effective too. Cam Gigandet seemed to be over acting at times but he's okay in his limited screen time. The twist involving his character I sort of saw coming though. The bloody violence is well executed and the mutants looked freaky. They're vicious killers who think about only one thing; survival and they'll kill any poor soul caught in their way. The secrets of what happened are slowly revealed which worked in it's favor. The twists at the end were surprising. I saw one of them coming because after a while it sort of became kind of obvious but a few others I wasn't expecting. The conclusion was fitting and overall I thought the movie was all right. The dialogue wasn't the greatest occasionally and the obvious twist could've been handled better but it's still a decent rental. If you're a big fan of the genre than chances are you'll enjoy Pandorum. It has an interesting story, impressive special effects, plenty of action, and good performances by the cast especially Foster who makes this sci-fi action thriller worth the time to watch at least once.",Pandorum
102,tributarystu,Failed preconceptions,7,14 December 2009,"I always feel when watching a film influenced by Paul W.S. Anderson that it has a particular stench. But as much as I hate his take on Resident Evil and AvP, I cannot deny that I truly enjoyed Event Horzion. The atmosphere is (and I indulge in this cliché) claustrophobic in the purest sense, in a manner that seems to do wonders in the sci-fi environment.Pandorum ""borrows"" that feel, while also borrowing a bunch of elements from sci-fi horror movies new and old. In fact, I'd say it's basically The Descent meets Sunshine under the influence of Event Horizon. But it works wonderfully well, as all the elements come together in a tense and intriguing movie, even if the mystery gets dulled by what I'd still call Andersonian drawbacks.The story revolves around the remaining crew of a spaceship that wakes up to discover something is not quite right. If you have any idea of the aforementioned films, I'm sure you can figure out in which direction things go from there, as it becomes obvious some flesh-craving creatures have inhabited the ship.The actors, led by Ben Foster, do a solid job in maintaining the suspense in what could otherwise be construed as a lightweight screenplay. Yet, I feel the need to emphasize once more that while I am a sucker for high-brow material, Pandorum conquered me by being smart and particular about the details. If you can accept it's not a novel piece of sci-fi, but a solid re-imagining of familiar tales, then I see no reason why you should shy away from this.",Pandorum

Dennis Quaid probably was my favorite besides Norman Reedus (!!) who I know from AMC's series 'The Walking Dead' and 'The Boondock Saints'. But unfortunately he got a WAY too little part.

I'm guessing both apply a little.It starts off with a rush, Ben Foster waking up from deep sleep to an empty room, wet and slimy wide angle close-ups, shaky camera, flickering lights, panic, darkness, not remembering anything. Quite the opposite to the static shots of Alien. This movie doesn't of course exactly mimic Alien, but the settings are a bit similar.The mystery of whats going on starts to unravel little by little, but you are not really sure of what's going on any more than the cast. Dennis Quaid waking up next, Foster sets out to find out what has happened in the space ship and runs into a few other people and some creatures.The package seems quite good, there's action, some very scary looking creatures, interesting plot, real scares and the sets look good. The direction on the other hand and the camera-work are a bit hectic at times and not very focused and some of the supporting cast feel a bit like bystanders. While Ben Foster acts his part quite well, the supporting cast not as much. The pacing feels maybe a bit off overall.So a lot of good stuff, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of the overall style and direction. This could've been a real hit if it was a bit more polished. Even tho the plot is OK, the movie doesn't feel very ""intelligent"".",Pandorum
105,herbqedi,Superior SciFi with Amazing Special Effects by Senior Tech Herbert Blank,9,3 August 2011,"This one keeps you guessing throughout with an eeriness met with ingenuity. The acting is edgy yet always believable and the repressed emotions quite sincere. Some of the dialog is a bit corny but most of it works. But, it is its visual qualities that make Pandorum really stand out from the rest of the pack. Senior tech Herbert Blank who caught our eyes with his work on V for Vendetta and Inglorious Basterds really kicks it into high gear here. The effects alone are worth the price of admission/ Three cheers for Herbert Blank.As for the ultimate resolution of the plot, I was a little dissatisfied at first but the more I thought about it, the more I liked it.",Pandorum
106,fung0,Full marks for style,8,30 November 2009,"There should be more movies like Pandorum. This is dark, scary sci-fi adventure that delivers exactly what it promises, and then some.The first section is the most unusual. A crew member awakens with no memory into vast, darkened starship. He's forced to slither through claustrophobic service tunnels, then abruptly face barely-glimpsed cannibalistic creatures. The director really keeps you guessing: for a long time, you really have no idea where things are headed. It helps that all this is shot in true darkness, not your usual Hollywood flood lighting; you see what the character sees by the eerie light of a single Cyalume stick. The rebirth symbolism is clearly intentional.The meat of the film is a bit more conventional, following a standard action-adventure formula, but the opening segment sets it up with above-average grit and sweaty immediacy. What's more, while the story is ultimately familiar, it's cunningly revealed, a bit at a time, so you're never really sure how it's going to play out. Characters are strong, and appear at unpredictable intervals, with motives that are rarely quite obvious. The action is furious, but nobody does anything conspicuously stupid... the film sticks to its own logic, and builds through multiple twists to a nerve-wracking climax.There are plenty of edge-of-the-seat frights along the way, but at root this is an action film. It's not about fear, but about courage, under some of the most trying circumstances imaginable. Pandorum reminded me (in a good way) of films like Doomsday and Outlander: dark (in more ways that one), violent, stylish, energetically-directed, and hugely entertaining all the way. No, Pandorum does not, in the end, break much new ground. But it covers the familiar territory with great zeal, from a fresh perspective. It's not going to make anyone's ten-best lists, but it's a movie I'm going to enjoy watching over and over.",Pandorum

108,g-hbe,Fell asleep.,4,4 August 2019,"This sounded like a decent 'Alien' film, but by the half-way point we were both nodding off as most of the dialogue was whispered and almost buried under the ambient sound effects so we had trouble following the plot (if indeed there is one). The action sequences seemed to take precedence over almost everything else and were cut so quickly and given the 'wobble-cam' treatment that it was difficult to see what was going on. To see a decent actor like Dennis Quaid reduced to plying his trade in third-rate stuff like this was disappointing.

Of course, that old cinematographer's friend, DARKNESS, is a major player here. Do directors think that shooting dark dark scenes will somehow improve a motion picture?

110,Dragonsouls,Film Noir at it's finest,7,30 March 2010,"After watching this with high expectations I could honestly say I wasn't let down. I don't think it's as good as Alien, or Solaris, but it was a movie that you don't see everyday. There are few movies like this these days. ""Moon"" was fantastic but this was different. It felt like Alien mixed with Space Odyssey 2001, and Solaris, both the re-make and original one.But it did have it's own unique flavor. I was impressed by the production values of this film. Such dark set design, incredible make-up too, but most importantly, a great script! I really loved the screen play, even though the directing was a bit flawed. Perhaps I'm too old fashioned for the modern style of direction, and heavy metal music laced action scenes, but in this case, the director was definitely helped by the impressive screen-play. Even though it reminded me of the films I've mentioned above, it was still unique. The mystery was sustained through the end, and the ending doesn't let you down.A big reason is the characters. Ben Foster is never one that lets me down and whenever he is cast in a film, I know Im bound for an emotional ride. Dennis Quaid was also very solid, and so were the other cast members who I have never heard of before, but were fine actors.If you're into the Sci-Fi survival horror genre, then don't miss this film. Other than, Moon, and the Solaris re-make, this genre has been dormant in the past 10 years and it's nice to see a film like this produced very well indeed by the established Paul Anderson.7/10 Now I can't wait for the ""Dead Space"" film to come out!",Pandorum
111,RichardSRussell-1,Totally Formulaic Hack Work,3,28 September 2009,"Pandorum (R, 1:48) — SF, 3rd string, formulaIt's been 24 years since Dennis Quaid appeared in a pretty good adaptation of Barry B. Longyear's Hugo-winning novella ""Enemy Mine"". In between he's given solid performances in SF&F fliks Innerspace, Dragonheart, the sadly under-appreciated Frequency, and even (for his own part) The Day after Tomorrow. And he's slated for the lead in next year's Legion, with its impressive trailers. So he looked like a guy who could pick 'em, and I had high hopes for Pandorum.Alas, it turns out to be totally formulaic hack work. A bunch of grungy survivors is constantly imperiled by creepy critters as they trek thru dark, dangerous, often slimy, occasionally pointy corridors in search of a mcguffin. The good guys get picked off 1 by 1, with only minor props for the black guy not being the very 1st to go.There are 2 wrinkles of originality here, the 2nd of which is supposed to be the Big Reveal at the end, so I suppose I won't give it away other than to say it wasn't all that big and had been telegraphed by the nosebleed, among several other things.The 1st wrinkle, tho, is the basic plot premise, which is that the whole story is taking place on a huge spaceship instead of some castle, swamp, abandoned factory, or cavern. Launched in 2174, Elysium's cargo comprises 16,000 colonists in suspended-animation capsules, headed for the paradise planet, Tanis. But the crew gets its final message from home, to the effect that Earth's 25 billion people had finally ruined the place and ""you're all that's left of us"". Suddenly the colony ship becomes humanity's last hope, a la Robert A. Heinlein's ""Generation"" and its countless clichéd ripoffs. Given that premise, I found myself rooting for Tanis, hoping that it would be spared the ""sapiens"" plague that had already destroyed its twin.Cut to the indeterminate present. Quaid's Lt. Payton comes out of deep sleep shortly after Ben Foster's Cpl. Bower is spontaneously decanted. They're alone. Nobody's running the ship. What happened? Conveniently (for the screenwriter, not the characters), a side effect of cryogenic sleep is partial memory loss.But some knowledge remains. Bower knows he's a nuclear engineer, and he's pretty sure he can fix the power surges that are affecting the ship if only he can get from here (wherever ""here"" is) to the engine room. But all the doors are electronically locked, so he's reduced to crawling thru the ductwork until he comes to the big, empty, rusty corridors. Oh, and of course it's all dark, because the power's misbehaving, so he must rely on a supply of chemical lightsticks obviously drawn from the same quartermaster store as the old Western ""6""-shooters. I'm sure that it's pure coincidence that the surrounding murk means that they didn't have to blow a lot of money on believable sets.Similarly, Payton remains in the video room while Bower is off on his quest; this meant that the director could shoot almost all of their scenes separately, and that the scriptwriter could shuck and jive and fill a ridiculous amount of time having the 2 of them try to contact each other on the radio.Bower meets other survivors along the way, each with a piece of the puzzle needed to find the route to the mcguffin, but they're largely nameless stereotypes, including the obligatory babeulicious expositor with the bulging low-cut T-shirt. The credits list her as Nadia (Antje Traue), tho I don't recall anyone actually verbalizing it.Speaking of the credits, definitely do not see this film if you're epileptic. The stroboscopic ""atmosphere"" that Constantin Film created as a backdrop for the closing credits damn near induced a seizure in me.The word ""pandorum"", incidentally, apparently refers to a psychological condition in which stress and anxiety produce dislocation, disorientation, and paranoia, and it's the presumptive reason for the general dereliction. The trick (such as it is) is to figure out who's actually experiencing pandorum so you know whom to trust — or at least how far — and this psychological question provides enuf interest to keep Pandorum from sinking to the bottom of the pools of garbage- and junk-infested blackwater that always seem to show up in hackneyed efforts like this.

112,freaky_dave,Better than most critics say,7,30 September 2009,"I saw Pandorum last night and was somewhat impressed with the movie. After reading critics reviews, and how they trashed it, I was going in expecting less and was pleasantly surprised.Pandorum borrows heavily from other sci-fi movies, but what movie doesn't nowadays. Taking a lot of ideas from Alien, a 1979 classic sci-fi movie, and borrowing the creatures from The Descent, another near classic movie from a few years ago, Pandorum was still impressive. The storyline wasn't completely original because it reminded me a lot of Event Horizon, but whereas Pandorum went more for a science level, Event Horizon was more supernatural. Most people trashed Event Horizon as well, but it was another movie I liked also, even though the ending of that movie was flawed. Of course I'm reviewing Pandorum, so I won't mention the former film anymore.THe cast for the most part was rather good for a movie of this type. Ben Foster, and Dennis Quaid are the two most marketable names, but the other characters, outside of maybe the Cam Gigandet character, worked pretty good. My only real problem with Gigandet was that he overacted a bit, but otherwise everything was good.The movie does claustrophobia well, and the entire movie had me jumping a lot. THere was tension, and for the most part the film was fast paced. I didn't find myself looking at my watch one time. THe visuals were decent, but the creatures should've been kept in the shadows more. Horror works best when the viewer uses his/her own imagination to visualize them.Did I say horror. Well yeah because this is really a sci-fi horror film more along the lines of Alien as mentioned above. It doesn't match the classic status of that movie, but Pandorum is worth seeing for its psychological feel and how some people might act after being in space for so long. By the way, the movie does have a twist, which I will not spoil for anyone who wants to see it.Note: THis is a film that may make most of its money on DVD, and will likely acquire somewhat of a cult status.",Pandorum

Its story plot may not be very original and the twists are slight but still I had fun watching intense and non-stop action sci-fi movie. It is normal with nothing fantastic to mention but will entertain you with its suspense.The story: It starts straight into the action and intensity. Bower wakes up in a pod and found that he may be alone in the ship. But sooner, he is not the only one. OOOOhhhhh...as the adventure around the ship starts seeing some mild twists. Action and chase scenes are quite intense with its unusual soundtrack. The soundtrack choose not to be the creepy soundtrack that most horror movies feature. As usual, it contains non-stop shocking scenes which sometimes get annoying. Some shocking scenes are also not properly done, the director just put a really loud sound into scenes which are not even found shocking.Overall: It is pretty intense movie to watch in cinema and feel the darkness surround you and it may have the claustrophobia feeling.

Fortunately, the production company/director of this film managed to keep the $chlock Factor of this film to a minimum, and they would undoubtedly have managed to make an even better film had they found someone/anyone other than Dennis Quad to play the role he played in this film. That said, the best acting in this film does not go to any of the human actors (though they were all quite good), but to the beasts.

When the protagonists wake up from a long sleep, they try to retrieve their memories and find out what their mission is and what happens on the spaceship. Such cryogenic sleep can lead to various symptoms and eventually paranoia, while some of them seem to succumb in the end. Along with life-threatening technical problems in the spacecraft, there is also an unknown threat with them onboard. For the idea and the script of the film a very good job has been done overall, with a dark style like Alien, plenty of suspense that gradually peaks and finally come 1-2 small twists.

116,pontram,"Very entertaining, but fanciless SciFi/Horror",7,15 November 2009,"At first I was very enjoyed about the beginning and the premises. After all, I knew soon where the movie's direction will be. Personally, I hate Zombie-movies a bit, except if there's a cute ass wiping them out. So I was pleased that the enemies are at least not Zombies but mutated humans with high combat capabilities, still dumb like zombies, and also cannibalistic, but much much more dangerous, that gives the action a good kick.Surely I had to press the 'SciFi brain-off' switch in my head after the interesting beginning, because the main mystery so far was, how these monsters could have been evolved, and the only answer is, over a very long time, and thus the ship is probably lost in space.Surprisingly this is not so, the authors switched on their brains for a limited period and elaborated some little twists, certainly very rare and very late, but, nice.In the meantime there is much much disorientation, tightness, fleeing and gasping and fighting, a little bit too much for me. But at the moment I liked being frightened by those industrial standards of adult scaring. Even when I had to wonder how the actors managed to stay serious while chatting about 'Pandorum', that is like 'Formicula' a ridiculous and cheap sounding name.The movie has many clichés, it is a mixture from really many other SF-movies, although there is great atmosphere and there are good actors. The editing has some flaws, but it does the job to entertain you very well. For that, I gave a too high rating of 7, the movie deserves a 5 or 6. But it's made very professional, and the design is very convincing.It is clearly no match for 'District 9', neither technical, nor imaginative, but it's also surprisingly captivating. And that's a movie should be in the first place.Nevertheless some questions to the authors: For which purpose is this huge ship sent to the new planet, when it doesn't carry, say, about ten billions of the 24 billions people on earth ? And how did the mutants feed themselves over years, when the pods with the people are nearly indestructible...",Pandorum

I love to watch under rated films. But sadly in this case, I don't think Pandorum was under rated at all. Sure, it has some good elements to it, but it's execution feels like it was done by film students who happened to have a big budget. (Nothing against film students, I am one)Pandorums plot is quite basic, but still interesting none the less. It's the future, the earth is running out of resources, and a ship has been sent to investigate a possibly habitable planet. Well, Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid wake up on the ship, and there seems to be some weird things happening. It grabs you from the start, but I felt as it goes along, it doesn't quite amaze me like I wanted, and by the time it wraps up I kinda felt a bit indifferent. One of the best things about this film is Ben Foster. He's an amazing actor and really brings it in this. In a way, he's almost too good for this movie. Dennis Quaid is also really good in this. Another performance that feels like it outshines the movie itself a bit. The horror element of this film is good at first, due to its intense atmosphere, but it kinda loses steam after a while. Perhaps they needed to keep the creatures in the darkness a little more, because they reveal them fully and it kind of decreases from the scary-ness, which is disappointing. They build a cool atmosphere and then they kinda throw it all away.Something about the way it's edited together and directed makes it feel amateurish. I don't think its terrible cheap looking or anything, but there's some editing errors that are obvious, and style choices that i'm not sure works. It just kinda feels off kilter, and it certainly could have been tightened up.Overall, this is a movie that had some potential, but it doesn't quite meet it.

I thought the creatures in this film looked very creepy and i thought the creatures looked practical,so a well done on the special effects.I quite liked the story and i thought the film was well directed. i didn't really have any problems with this film other than i thought the beginning was a little slow ,but everything else was good!. i thought the creatures were BadAss and i thought Ben Foster was A BadAss! he was very cool in this film and he knows how to fight!.

I also liked the idea of Ben foster and Dennis Quaid awakening from hyper sleep on the sleeper ship called the Elysium,and i found it quite surprising when it was revealed later in the film that their were other people on the ship that they didn't know about and they had already been awake before them.I just thought this was an exciting story with great ideas and that's why i gave the film a nine out of ten,it deserves that rating for all the effort put into making this film,also when people make fun of this movie it just makes me like it even more!. everything in this film went right in my opinion,you had a good story,good acting and good characters and a good cast,the effects were great and the Action at the end was great and i also liked the ending to this movie,it was a strange ending but i still liked it! i thought it was a good way to end this movie,it ended just right for me.

127,MovieProductions,"""Pandorum"" is exotic and interesting, but not involved",5,5 January 2011,"** out of (****)Pandorum is definitely a unique thrill-seeker. When's the last time we heard a film with ""horror"" and ""science fiction"" in the same sentence? It is quite undeniably exotic and interesting, but ""Pandorum"" isn't involved. In fact, the first half moves at the pace of a turtle and is only half as interesting as it thinks it is. However, the second half completely destroys its first, but the excitement arrives a tad bit late and the film, while it kicks into high gear, near reaches for the brilliance of horror/sci-fi extravaganzas such as ""Alien"" or ""Event Horizon"" (however, the ending is by far the best I've seen out of any movie).The one thing this movie has going for it when all else fails is its atmosphere. Being in a spaceship, which is the Titanic's of space crafts, is simply remarkable. Also, this movie has a very claustrophobic feel to it which is great considering those are the film's intentions. Furthermore, the ending, as previously stated, is by far, the coolest finale I've seen. Had the movie been like that, this would be a superior ""10"". Alas, the movie has its flaws.First up are the performances. Nobody truly stands out and there is some wasted potential. Dennis Quaid is pretty much wasted, Tyler Foster does a decent job, and everyone else... they're pretty much alright. The script is very average, but then again, it's very give-or-take. Same goes with the dialogue. The biggest downfall of the film is its pacing though. The first half has a very slow and steady pace and then the second is very break-neck and then in the end it pretty much cools down. All in all, I enjoyed ""Pandorum"", but sadly, I can't recommend it or say it's worth your time. I only liked this beast of a ride because it's rare you see a sci-fi/horror these days (kind of like mainstream creature features). However, it's nothing you haven't seen before. Through in some of ""The Descent"", ""The Cave"", and ""Alien"" and well... you pretty much have this movie. How does ""Pandorum"" stack up next to the director's previous work ""Case 39"" (forthcoming work for us Americans)? Pretty much the same. The director may deal with interesting cases (pun-intended) but he never does anything to distinguish his movies from others and the end result is dissatisfying.

But that wasn't enough to pull him through this mess.Incoherent story, bad dubbing, cheesy effects, choppy editing, bad acting, this one's got it all. Plus a truly nauseating ending.There's probably enough reviews here, but I thought I'd point out that there seems to be a major flaw in the impartiality of this board, as, at the time of writing, all of the good reviews are on the first pages and all the bad ones are on the last pages. What's going on here? Surely IMDb editors wouldn't be burying bad reviews because they like the movie, would they? I'll leave it to you to decide.",Pandorum
130,TheEtherWalk,"Watchable, but not perfect",6,21 January 2010,"Pandorum is the story of a group of survivors on a ship trying to reach a planet with known life on it. Earth is dying and several thousand humans have been cryogenically frozen to try and colonize the new planet.Ben Foster gives a good lead performance as the first one to awaken. He meets up with Dennis Quaid's character and thaws him out as well. One of the weakest things about the movie is Quaid's performance. There is a twist to his character that isn't so much unbelievable as it is poor casting. They run into some cannibalistic mutants which are never really explained properly. While the movie has some scary moments, it never really builds to anything.Foster's character meets two characters who are basically hardened survivors and expert fighters. One doesn't speak English and the other one was clearly cast for her ample cleavage. Both never become more than cardboard clichés.Another twist at the end of the movie you will see from miles away. This is because of the simple reason that they never show the outside of the ship, which gives the movie a claustrophobic feel, but feels way too intentional and makes the ending predictable. The mediocre script relies on weird, cryptic speeches by a couple of characters to build momentum for the climax, which was also disappointing. The mutants end up being sort of an afterthought, and while the fights with them are entertaining, they never get dealt with properly.There are things in this movie that made no sense, like how this ship survived intact in the place that they realize they are at the end. The whole 'pandorum' angle is never really believable. Where did the mutants get spears and razor-sharp metal claws? How did the fighters survive without resorting to cannibalism? Pandorum is disappointing in the end, despite some interesting elements. Mostly it gets let down by a half-baked script and poor performances. The overall direction is surprisingly good by Christian Alvart. Seen better, seen worse.",Pandorum

If you liked Aliens and Resident Evil...this is like both of those movies got together and had a sequel. Well not quite, but the story was good and had no gaping holes in it. The acting was good without going over the top.I loved the way this movie started; guy wakes up from hyper-sleephis memory is not fully functional, he knows things are not right and has to save the day.I thought the story was great in that they did not over-explain everything like they have in so many sci-fi movies. The mid plot line was very good never found myself asking ""what the hell are you doing"", and the ending was very good without being so trivially expected.Of course Dennis Quaid is a great actor but I really liked watching Ben Foster.

134,AJ4F,"Overpopulation madness as a plot device, once again",7,11 September 2016,"The acting and suspense were good, if not outstanding. The plot had a twist which set it above similar films with familiar pale, slimy creatures. The depiction of filth on the ship was squeamishly done and the female lead was appealing at any dirt level. The suspense wasn't of ""Alien"" caliber but the action stayed interesting throughout. It was worth the time.But once again, I was struck by the Hollywood theme of Man crowding the Earth to death and using elaborate technologies to ""fix"" it at the 11th hour. I question whether the Earth could ever get as packed as 24 billion in 2153. Mass die-offs would probably prevent that but public apathy/inaction makes me wonder if we'd go to such lengths to keep people alive at the expense of nature. The current ruining of landscapes with ""green"" wind power and fracking is ominous. People seem to think we're supposed to grow forever and keep destroying nature, since that's all they've known. Does such a dim species deserve to survive?I just wish Hollywood would make a film about the much simpler birth control solution vs. treating overpopulation as our inevitable destiny, even desirable. A few films have tried (e.g. ""Z.P.G."" or ""Children of Men"") but the plot usually involves someone rebelling against population- control, as if selfish acts are heroic.

136,toll-8,Dark and chilling but not good enough to make me care,3,12 October 2012,"What happens when you awaken on an abandoned ship in space alone? Is the simple premise of Christian Alvart's Pandorum. Starring Ben Foster and Dennis Quad as the two men who find themselves on an abandoned space craft with no memory of what has happened. This dark tale should leave you feeling lonely, claustrophobic, and above all frightened about the prospect of having no way of survival.We open with Bower (Foster) who awakens from hyper sleep and finds himself wandering a space craft's flight deck alone. After freshening himself up and attempting to remember what he is doing there he finds another man, Payton (Quaid), who has also just woken with no memory of how they got there. With all doors having been sealed shut due to the failing power Bower climbs through a ventilation shaft, breaking himself into the main decks of the ship, in order to get answers and turn the power back on. Meanwhile Payton stays behind in order to guide him through the dark corridors via the control computer that can be powered manually. Whilst searching the ship Bower comes across others who have also awoken to the silence, however it doesn't take long before Bower finds himself meeting the one reason the ship is so desolate. With monster like killing machines hot on his tail Bower, and his new team, must be lead by Payton through the dark tunnels of the ship in order to regain power from the nuclear reactor before they are killed by the mutations breathing down their neck. The mood of the film is very dark, chilling, and silent. When the film opens we spend several minutes alone with Bower and the silence with him is almost overbearing. Instantly you find yourself in the midst of space alone with him. Again when he ventures into the heart of the ship we hear nothing but silence until the high pitch screeching of the zombie like monsters startles you. The cinematography by Wedigo von Schultzendorff highlights the light amongst the dark and gives us a futuristic feel to proceedings. The vision of the film is actually one of the only highlights as much of the rest of it doesn't feel as good. The characters aren't very fleshed out, we learn very little about them and at times failed to really care if they survived or not. The script is poor, especially some of the dialogue. At one point a character says 'I remember last time I woke from hyper sleep I couldn't remember anything for months.' That's funny you just remembered that!! The story also fails to grip you and at times it is hard to follow where the characters are going. The dark corridors actually work against this part of the film.The story is a major issue with the film. The intrigue and tension at the beginning was infectious but as soon as we were introduced to the zombies in space I found myself losing interest. It was a mash of many films put into space. At first it felt like we may get an Alien type film but ended up getting The Descent crossed with Event Horizon. Throughout the film we also see many flashbacks which seem to have very little need to be there, especially considering by the end they had little to do with the story. The overall reason for the story turns out to be quite an interesting idea, I won't give it away here, but it ends in such a poor way as if it is all a happy ending which my interpretation of the film is that it is not. The B story has us learning about a space paranoia called pandorum; see the title comes in somewhere, which sends people into a mad state when they believe that everyone around them is there to kill them. This is constantly mentioned throughout and the problem with this is that is then becomes slightly obvious what is happening in one strand of the story. The finale of the film is also a major let down with things coming together quite poorly and with none of it ever really making sense. There are two stories going on throughout, in a much bigger story, but they seem to become confused with each other by the end.This is not a film I would recommend. Of course it will have its fans out there but for me this was a poorly executed movie. The tense scenes from the beginning soon dispersed and it became something we have seen before. The performances weren't particularly good either with Quaid delivering his poor lines poorly, and Foster seeming wrongly cast as the hero. The film is packed with problems and issues and it is one I fail to see what the point actually was. Not much makes sense by the end and the finale becomes too easy and happy for a film that started so dark and morbid. Overall a disappointing piece of work which shows why it struggled at the box office, meaning a sequel is not going to be made.

The special effects are hot, but they could have done with far less of it, and it would have still been an amazing story.I like the concepts they came up with, such as the temporary amnesia one has after waking from hyper-sleep. This not only helps setup a voyage of discovery of oneself, but also shrouds in mystery a lot stuff that has happened to them, that they should have remembered but can't. Wish this movie had done a bit better in the box office, then there might have been a sequel to show their lives after these events.",Pandorum

Both suffering from hyper sleep-induced short term amnesia, Payton mans the com as Bower descends within the bowels of the ship to restore power. Along the way, Bower finds himself the preferred delicacy of tribal mutants while Payton deals with a psychotic crew member. Sorry, but that's all I'm gonna' tell you.Reminiscent of several films including Aliens, The Descent, and Event Horizon, to name a few, Pandorum is not unique. However it is rather entertaining and maintains a fairly unsettling atmosphere. What I did find refreshing is that there are no gimmicky characters oh-so-common in many like films such as the ridiculous little girl in Aliens. Ugh! Nope. All serious here folks and if you want blood, you get that, too.What disappoints me is the film's seemingly short time span.

When are directors going to learn that only little kids are afraid of the dark? Movies like this are ridiculously boring, because you don't get to see much; just flashing lights in the dark. I understand that it was supposed to show the inside of a wrecked spaceship, but the use of so many dark scenes with little or no light would make any movie utterly unwatchable. The aliens were a mixture of the monsters from the Descent with fighting skills borrowed from the Predator. We've seen it all before. The movie was pretty boring to me, and I can't understand why it even had to last 1 hour and 45 minutes. The duration made it even more boring. To make things worse, the characters were whispering all the time, even when they did not have to. It totally got on my nerves. The ending was, well, interesting, but I do not like to watch a movie only to get a few interesting minutes in the beginning and a few minutes in the end.

Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined. The film itself is a sort of a SCI-FI/Mystery/Thriller. The plot revolves around two pilots who wake from stasis. They have no recollection of where they are who they are or what their mission is. This opening sequence sets the scene for the whole movie.. For a low budget movie the effects are spectacular the acting is excellent and the ending of the story is extremely satisfying. I saw Pandorum last night and was somewhat impressed with the movie. After reading critics reviews, and how they trashed it, I was going in expecting less and was pleasantly surprised. Pandorum borrows heavily from other sci-fi movies, but what movie doesn't nowadays. Taking a lot of ideas from Alien, a 1979 classic sci-fi movie, and borrowing the creatures from The Descent, another near classic movie from a few years ago, Pandorum was still impressive. The storyline wasn't completely original because it reminded me a lot of Event Horizon, but whereas Pandorum went more for a science level, Event Horizon was more supernatural. The ship actually being underwater on the Tanis (or whatever it's called) planet is a neat little twist at the end but it doesn't make up for the bad lighting and little character development.

It can be confusing, the protagonist falls down WAY too much (about 5 times before the first hour)and the rest of the cast of characters (the exception of Dennis Quaid) are bland. Action scenes are filmed too close or too dark.Yet, I cannot not say Pandorum was bad. It delivered exactly what I expected: a horror sci-fi in a claustrophobic spacecraft with Dennis Quaid doing something questionable. Really, it's fine.The movie starts off with crew member Bower (Ben Foster) waking up, not knowing who he is, disoriented, & not knowing what his mission is supposed to be. Then another member, lieutenant Payton, (played by Dennis Quaid) wakes up, but no better with the memory. Still, they are determined to turn this ship back on, as things don't look good with it. But where are the other members? What the heck happened and what are those crazy & scary looking things with teeth? Eventually, Bower meets up with more survivors, but we put our focus on Bower and Payton, the only folks who seem to know what might be going on and how to fix it.

The problem when doing this though is that it can become clichéd and audiences will have guessed the ending or any other plot twist before it happens. Despite this, Pandorum is entertaining to watch but is not a film that I will return to see again.The two lead actors Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid, are both watchable and have some good dialogue at the start. The film succeeds in creating an interesting - if slightly impractical - environment. Atmosphere is always important and the film maintains it until later on when more characters are introduced. Anyone who thought that Tim Robbins in War of the Worlds to break the tension will find this here.By the time the ship's inhabitants are revealed, any sense of terror is lost and it becomes a film against the clock to create tension instead. As the film progresses we learn more about the ship and its purpose but some points could have used a clearer explanation.Overall the film is entertaining but does not end nearly as strong as how it started.",Pandorum

Normally, I wouldn't give much credence to BO--plenty of great movies never see the light of day--but this time, popularity and quality go hand in hand.Yikes.What seemed like a great premise goes nowhere fast and turns into a mishmash of about six other films and far too many genres. You've literally got ninja warriors with alien demons along with tried and true sci-fi tropes that we've seen far too many times before. The end result isn't a psychological thriller or a complicated and taut sci-fi fantasy film, but just solid crap unworthy of even a made-for-TV-movie. To discover that the director decided to ""meld"" a script he already had with the one he read by the screenwriter of this pile is not a surprise. The only surprise is that there weren't thirteen or so other scripts that were cut and pasted together to make this one a gruesome and sad reality.The only reason I continued watching the film to the end was because I thought that maybe- -just maybe--there would be some fantastic twist or last minute revelation, and though there was a feeble attempt at such a plot turn, in the end, there's really nothing worth sitting through in Pandorum. Don't waste your time the way I have.

The fate of humanity, space madness and mysterious creatures aboard the ship are all I will divulge of the plot. The less you know going into the movie, the better. Luckily, Pandorum's trailer is one of the few these days that doesn't give away the whole movie before you see it. With that said, I realize this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you've been disappointed by a lot of genre/sci-fi action/horror hybrids lately, you might really enjoy this one. I thought it was the best of its kind since Outlander.",Pandorum
160,bobbywell,Well put together.,8,9 March 2019,"This is a well put together sci-fi horror flick. First you start out with Dennis Quaid who is always a solid and enjoyable actor. Rest of the cast is quite good as well.

161,bharath-karthikeyan,Very Novel and breaking clichés!,8,10 February 2017,"The Novelty and cliché breaking concepts will be realized when the movie credits zoom out but it doesn't mean that this movie is out of clichés - because the concept as it is driven by a clichéd story formula. There has been numerous movies which had tried to replicate ALIEN but not even the sequels to ALIEN could justify the masterpiece. Pandorum is a clone of a zombie/aliens movie set in a space ship and hence even though it offers surprises, the audience have seen it all in many movies/series and hence eventually turn out to be the slower parts of this movie. The places where Pandorum shines are the editing, screenplay and casting. There are moments where CGI shows up B-grade quality but is amp-ed with the editing and screen presence of the actors and this definitely sets the bar high for this movie. I watched it on Netflix, years after its release and this movie definitely holds up well after 8 years! Therefore i give it an 8 out of a 10!",Pandorum
162,eddie052010,"Unremarkable, with a decent twist.",6,8 July 2018,"How often is that that a bad, usually awful film can actually redeem itself with a half decent twist at the end? It's a trick as rare finding a lost artefact, but it can happen. While there are various examples one can point to for this to happen (like The Hunger Games: Catching Fire or Cloverfield), the specific example being discussed here is Pandorum. Let's take a look at this case study.Now there are various bad aspects of the film which have earned its rightly deserved negative press. The acting ranges from average to underwhelming, most notably with main players Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid. The former is bland to the point of monotony, and the latter while usually reliable overplays it to the point of hammy. Not to mention how utterly redundant the movie is as well. The movie rips off various other sci-fi, fantasy and horror movies in a way that seems like it was trying to create a blend to build something new, but instead is about as unoriginal as it gets. The ship that occupies most of the film heavily resembles the Nostromo from Alien. The bad guys, despite being designed by the Stan Winston Company, heavily resemble the Orcs from Lord Of The Rings if they were more pasty white. In other words The Hobbit type. The idea of paranoia in a confined space not to mention outer space has been explored before, with the likes of The Shining and Solaris. However it isn't just good movies Pandorum steals from. Oh no, the film is so derivative that it snatches elements from bad films too, making it feel furtherly lame. The main badass lady character in the film is a direct rip off of Alice from the awful Resident Evil movies, while the compartments among other aspects of the ship resemble those of prior laughably bad sci-fi horror Event Horizon. The fact that the film has Paul W. S. Anderson as producer who worked on both films isn't a surprise. On top of this, the various lame jump scares used throughout the film are not too dissimilar from the various teen slashers over the last few decades. Given that this film belongs to such a compelling genre like sci-fi horror, one would expect more originality in the initial plot threads.Not to mention how unexciting it all is. There is no tension simply because the characters are far too two dimensional and stock to be compelling, all the while the lame jump scares and occasional bad lighting are clear attempts to frighten the audience in cheap ways, attributing to how bad the director is at building it through any other means. It leaves the film overall an uninspired mess of which fails to frighten, unnerve and mostly entertain the viewer.So why the high rating? Well, it is because the movie actually has the balls to take an unexpected turn at the end and actually give us a nice addition to the presumably overdone genre of sci-fi horror. That being that the end twist is that one of the characters suffers with split personality disorder, of which is partially linked to a disease nicknamed Pandorum, hence the title of the film. While it makes the film arguably furtherly derivative of the various films that have already played this card in their storylines (from Psycho to Fight Club), this element of it being done in sci-fi horror is new and adds a decent twist in an otherwise pretty crappy movie.So I can recommend Pandorum? Not really. the derivative nature of the film, coupled with the lack of a compelling plot or characters for the most part fails to gain the attention of the viewer and therefore make it mostly not worth your while. However, the creative direction it takes towards the end is worth waiting for, and makes the experience all worth it. It is better than its cousin for Event Horizon that's for sure, of which is the opposite to this film: mostly fine but ruined by its last segment. Not bad, but not remarkable either. Certainly not worth a sequel though, despite what some Facebook groups would have you believe.",Pandorum
163,baba44713,A champion in blatant rip-offs per second,2,17 December 2009,"If you watched the first trailer for Pandorum, and only that trailer, you might be fooled into thinking that it's a movie about a crew of a colonization starship going insane under the influence of deep space psychosis. You might also be fooled into thinking that if you chose to watch this movie, you would be in for quite an interesting experience. A scary psychological sci-fi horror/thriller.. yum.What the trailer fails to show is that, once you decide to shell out money to watch the actual movie, you will be mostly watching said crew run away from monsters that sound like a Predator, move like Silent Hill monsters, climb walls like Aliens, look like predators from Descent only wearing armor from Quake's Stroggs, and altogether participate in the plot straight out of Event Horizon. Even the one single surprise the movie uses as its highlight is straight out stolen from a Futurama episode, although it was more probably stolen from a movie Futurama was spoofing. Rip-offs are so abundant it's not even funny. Not a single scene or plot point is original, it's like a study of how many movies can you steal stuff from and get away with it. And it would perhaps be forgivable if the movie was actually good, however Pandorum succeeds to be significantly worse than any movie it ripped off, making it a complete waste of time and money.This is a bad, bad movie. It tanked on the box office, and rightfully so. You might enjoy it if you have never seen any SF or Horror flick ever filmed. Also, film connoisseurs could get some mileage by trying to make a list of every movie Pandorum is ripping off. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. Don't say I didn't warn you.",Pandorum
164,TheLegendOfThe42,"Ultimately a fail, despite good aspects.",4,5 January 2021,"I have shied away from this film for a good while, and for good reason. You see, German directors generally aren't very good, and Christian Alvart is no exception to this rule. He genuinely loves genre cinema though, I'll give him that, and even bad directors occasionally get hold of a decent script. So could it be that this is Alvart's ""Event Horizon""?Unfortunately, no. Although the script deals with interesting concepts such as madness in deep space, colonization and enhanced evolution, it ultimately fails at creating a coherent, engaging story with interesting characters. You might say that this could have been the point, but even if this was something like an interesting experimental film (which it isn't), you probably wouldn't want to spend more than 30 million bucks on that. The characters don't manage to pull you in, and that's not because of the actors. Everyone tries to do their best with what's given to them - which is really not much.I mean, what could you possibly do with a plot of which the very premise is already a huge plot hole? Sure, the ""Elysium"" has crashed into the oceans of Tanis long ago with no hull breach, but a piece of metal breaks the window that withstood millions of tons of pressure. And of course the water enters so slowly that you can easily outrun it. Oh well.The production design was stunning, the creature FX great, the costumes and make-up really good. What messed up this film were the camera, the inept editing and the incompetent direction. Who called these at times horrifyingly redundant shots that managed to make the gorgeous set look bad? Why wouldn't you cut them out instead of slicing them in to give you eye cancer? Who lit this so badly?And let me tell you - whoever was responsible for shooting the action has no clue about shooting action. What an incoherent, badly choreographed and chopped up mess. Honestly, why even include action if it's as bad as this? Doesn't someone at some point watch it and goes ""This is garbage!""?The sound mix was questionable as well. Some very weird sound design choices and wrong panning combined with a sometimes jarring volume imbalance create true horror, only probably not in the intended way. The score was ""generic space horror stuff"" which you could probably buy for a few hundred bucks from some stock music website.Maybe it's only me, but most of the time ""Pandorum"" felt like a film by someone who tried to simulate how to make a film. Like a film by an impostor, a ""Thing""-like creature who tries to copy a human film director, without any emotion, any real vision or sense of pacing.This was a lot of money spent on something that should have been rewritten by a better writer and directed by a better director. But it's a nice little oddity that makes you giggle when you remember that the director had the audacity to set his film in the same universe as ""Event Horizon"", which is a much better film in every aspect.",Pandorum
165,garrettderose,A solid effort,7,28 September 2009,"Pandorum could've done without the monsters. If not, maybe cut their threat/screen time in half.That's pretty much my only gripe with this movie. It plays out like an episode of a TV show. I didn't mind that too much, that's pretty common for scifis.The movie looked great. The ship looked great as well.Music... ehh, it was a bit lacking. Music is one of those selling points for a movie, in my opinion. It wasn't horrible... but I'm always amazed when these huge productions skimp out on the music. Think about your favorite movies of all time? You can remember the music/theme, right? Pandorum isn't anything TOO special. It's a legit scifi though.

It established the locale very well, it was unafraid to show the future as a grimy messed-up hole rather than some squeaky-clean paradise and it really made you question if what the characters were experiencing was really real.But the potential was lost because half the time I couldn't understand what the actors were saying. Sometimes this was because of a foreign accent, other times the audio mix was off and the words were drowned out by the sound effects, and sometimes it was both.All in all, probably not worthy of your time.

If people like it, if they enjoy it, if they find the film exciting and creative, then to that extent for those people the film is successful. And if people enjoy it, that's fine, but if I think the film is terrible and say so (and of course give some reasons) this may save some people a few bucks and utter boredom some evening. So what was so terrible? You have a few people trapped on a space ship with a horde of flesh-eating mindless monsters. And that is basically it. Oh, there is something a crew member must do to save the ship, so a story of sorts along with cliché after cliché of fighting monsters over and again last moment this and last moment that ad nauseam. Really. Just that. The film is very Hollywoodish from beginning to end (if that means anything). So well okay it's a matter of taste.

I didn't know much more than IMDb's brief description going in, but set in space sounded good to me.Overall it's not a bad film. It looks amazing. The set pieces for me really worked. Darkened hallways I guess all look alike after a while, but you really got the feeling of a very large ship.Yes, there is a twist or two, and you can see at least one of them miles away. Overall the story in not that bad, and it would be interesting seeing more tales set in this universe. But it is nothing that hasn't really been done before either. The bad guys are pretty generic. I actually think it would have been a better film without them.The biggest issue to me was the sound. You have some loud noises when things happen, and the bad guys are pretty noisy. And then the main character talks in a gravelly whisper for much of the time. It was very hard to understand what was being said for a lot of the movie, at least to me.Probably a little bit better than Event Horizon.",Pandorum

Most sci-fi enthusiasts will have fun here. The acting by all is also good.I assume much of the production was in Eastern Europe. Germany was listed in the credits, but many of the names seemed Slavic. Good idea, because the money they put into set design must have been pricey in dollars, so I'm sure they saved a bundle.Overall, the writing is not much above average. American colloquialisms used by people hundreds of years in the future, or in galaxies far, far away exemplify laziness at the pen.

There's even a scary oooga booga babbling brown man, who has some incoherent florid story, with nice freshly-shiny pictures scraped into the wall. and even though the monsters are supposedly much faster and stronger than our heroes, somehow they can just never seem to catch up until just as the door closes.

172,moviesaccordingtodes,Pandorum pleasantly surprised me!,6,1 October 2014,"""Pandorum"" started off slow but I kept watching because of my love for Ben Foster's talent. He is usually in amazing movies so I stuck it out. Glad I did because I wasn't disappointed.I didn't know much about ""Pandorum"" going in. I was expecting it to be like any other thriller or sci-fi. It wasn't. It was sort of a mystery and we kind of guess what is going on but we don't really know until the last half hour.The alien type creatures in the movie were stereotypical looking but they did look real.Why was Dennis Quaid in this movie? Better question, why is Dennis Quaid in any movie? He ruined the scenes he was in with his unimpressive acting. Any time anything was weird or made a noise, his look of horror was comical and diminished the moment. His eyes popped open wide and he would get a funny look of shock or horror on his face. As time went on his acting got a tad better. Better to the point that I didn't laugh during serious moments.Does Cam Gigandet ever play a likable character? He is a good actor and great villain but he should be careful not to type cast himself. I can see him being good at a variety of roles but I haven't seen his talents broaden so far.Ben Foster as always, was amazing! I don't think he can get any more talented. It's just not possible. Why isn't he more famous?I was more impressed by the ending than anything else. I didn't expect it to end the way it did. I really liked the ending. It reminded me of the ending in Apocalypto.

174,Mr_Saxon,"""You Just Woke Up?""",8,12 November 2009,"I'm a big fan of science-fiction horror movies as long as they're done well. The last movie of this type that i recall enjoying was probably ""Event Horizon"" which replaced the typical haunted house concept with a spaceship. It's probably no coincidence that the director of that particular movie was also the producer here for the two have several things in common - including the fact that I found ""Pandorum"" equally enjoyable.I've read other reviews criticising the storyline of ""Pandorum"" and some argue that the movie attempts to throw too many different things into the mix - you have the protagonists waking with no memories as to where they are, you have the introduction of space madness (the 'Pandorum' of the title) and you have a group of angry mutants racing around eating people. For me, these parts came together perfectly and i never found myself thinking that the plot was too busy. The screenplay is actually very well written - there are mysteries presented to the viewer which are gradually answered, leading into other mysteries.The director has done a great job here with the camera carefully weaving through dark corridors, whilst the sets are magnificent; you truly feel as though you're trapped inside this dying vessel with Bower (Ben Foster) and Peyton (Dennis Quaid). Foster, in particular, keeps your attention on the screen as he struggles not only to survive in the hellish environment he's woken up in, but also to reclaim the memories of why he's here in the first place.Perhaps it's not incredibly scary but the movie works more as a mystery than a horror. That's not to say that there aren't any horrific elements - some scenes are fairly gory. I'll also praise the makers for choosing to use make-up and physical effects for the mutants rather than bland CGI.

There's no sense of a ""manufactured"" crisis, or nonsensical villain with some inexplicably diabolical ideology, or some brain hurting buildup only to arrive at a deus ex machina resolution.There are borrowed themes from other sci-fi horror movies certainly, but just as you think that you know where it's going with it, it does something refreshing--well worth watching, if you missed it, like I did.",Pandorum

180,merdiolu,Decent Sci-Fi Horror Attempt,8,8 November 2009,"Sci-Fi productions of this summer were mainly disappointing to horrible for me. From bloated piece of trash Terminator Salvation to banal Star Trek almost everything of this genre had the title of Hollywood big studio production company and style an awful cliché stereotype style I might add...Only exceptions were District 9 and Pandorum so far. ( I am planning to watch Moon also ) With Pandorum director Christian Alvart takes us to a familiar and classic sci-fi atmosphere we know since Alien. Space horror in dark cramped almost claustrophobic environment....All characters and incidents are deadly serious and creepy. Bower and Peyton , two astronauts wake up from an extended hyper sleep in a gigantic space ship called Elosiyum deep in space. They are suffering from hyper sleep amnesia. They have no memory of who they are or what their mission is though they know how to operate the damaged systems of ship. As main protagonist Bower takes off to scout the ship he discovers something no a lot of things went wrong and many kinds of different horrors and dangers lurking in darkness...Survival is the main goal now. Meanwhile Peyton is in a different kind of struggle with a situation he does not want to admit to himself...Are they suffering a sickness called Pandorum ? ( Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome )Actors are decent. I always liked Ben Foster since 3:10 Yuma and here again he does not disappoint as an astronaut who tries to reorient with his surroundings amidst great hazards plus remembering his past life meanwhile. This is a scared and confused pratogonist and Foster is just well on that one. Veteran actor Dennis Quaid is not bad either....The actors I have seen first time beautiful Antja Traue , martial arts champ Cung Le , Eddie Rouse and Cam Gigandet pull up impressive slightly crazed character performances. The plot twists were interesting. I have never seen them coming....As you watch the movie you can get a slight similarity of Event Horizon ( 1997 )-same production company or Dead Space PC game. You might even get a little Solaris vibe. And towards the end whole scripts kind of reminded ""Planet of Apes"" to me.

What I love so much about Pandorum is that Ben's character refuses to be paralyzed with fear and keeps pushing forward and survives myriad horrific circumstances despite his fear. I love what he does with the role. Pandorum is *not* for the faint-hearted. You'll see things that may haunt you for days afterward.The plot is *solid*. The cinematography and special effects are top-notch. Fight sequences are tight.The quality of this film cannot be overrated. If you like space movies, thrillers, survivalism, and seeing humans pushed to the limits, I guarantee you will love Pandorum. It's of the same caliber as Alien, Prometheus, and Predator.

Every time a question is answered, more come up, as the crew gradually regain memories, and the few survivors exchange what little they know.The closest parallel I can think of is not a movie, but the classic Robert A. Heinlein story ""Orphans of the Sky"", written in 1941. In Heinlein's book, a group of people is sent to the stars in a ""generation ship"", one designed to let folk live and multiply for the several generations the journey is expected to last. Unfortunately, something goes wrong, and the current passengers have lost most of the technological knowledge needed to run the ship, which is so sophisticated that it still continues to run itself. And some of the current passengers have become mutants, deadly to ""real"" humans.This vessel is a bit different, having 60,000 folk in ""hypersleep"", and a rotating crew of 3 to run things. But something goes wrong, and a ravenous enemy roams the corridors of today's ship, possibly mutated passengers, and the few humans who are alive have memories badly impaired by too-long a sleep. There are, of course, the obligatory buxom damsel in distress, the insane crew members, and many elements of a traditional locked-in sci-fi horror movie. However, in this movie, it is very well executed, and, as said, grips the moviegoer from beginning to end.This is a movie I will definitely watch again, if only for Antje Traue's performance as the buxom, ass-kicking damsel in distress.

The mutated passengers on the ship weren't given a proper explanation and were just painted up as ""villains"".Ben Foster's character seemed to be a mixed bag. Sometimes he seemed overly anxious and then borderline schizophrenic, the same with Quaid's character. If you watch the film you'll know what I mean.

So, I have some experience in these genres. As I perceive it, this movie just remixes and rehashes the standard ""scary"" things like eating bugs, falling into pools full of body parts, being lost in darkness, running away from blood-thirsty monsters, meeting crazy strangers all the while trying to keep some sort of a potentially devastating device from going ""boom!"". The makers of this flick just wanted to gross you out by throwing all this nasty stuff at you. And in order to make the standard grossing out effects scarier, they also set the movie in an all too familiar Alien-like spaceship environment. There were also some elements of The Cube evident. In essence, you are to believe that a major scientific project like a generation ship intended for colonization of a far-away planet gets organized in a highly unreliable and uncontrollable way. So, a mentally unstable crew gets all crazy, the ship gets messed up, the Earth blows up for an unexplained reason. Those aboard the generation ship who do not become criminally insane turn into mindless mutants, because the crew is supposedly injected with some ""environment adaptivity enhancement"" drug, but it kicks in too early and those affected become environmentally adapted to the rusty messed up ship, lose all signs of humanity and most of their mental abilities. What would those poor overly-adaptive humans turn into if they had a chance to adapt to environment of the planet of their destination? Would they still turn into mindless cannibalistic animals upon their intended arrival? My overall impression of this movie is like this: it is not scifi as it lacks the actual ""science fiction"". Instead it is a bunch of pseudo-scifi gore and dirt intended to be as disgusting as possible. There is really no story, no character development, no philosophy, no message, no room for imagination - nothing that makes a good scifi movie. It seems that the film makers of today lost any ability to make interesting scifi movies that make sense and evoke thought and imagination.

So basically there is nothing about this film you haven't seen before and you wade through it to get to the end and say ""oh OK"" .What I really don't understand is why have they made it? Other than the last two and a half minutes of the film there is absolutely nothing original about it, and I would even go as far as to say that it's about as close to ripping off Alien as is possible. Ridley Scott made Alien in the 1970's which is unsurpassed as a space sci fi film, infinitely better and well, what's the point? You might like this film if you like sci fi movies and have not seen Alien, which is like asking a Muslim if he's heard of Mecca. You see there's my point, if you like sci fi then you must have seen Alien because it is the Mecca of sci fi movies so the only way anyone would think this film is original is if they have not seen Alien and if they've not seen Alien chances are they don't like sci fi anyway and wouldn't therefore watch Pandorum. Get the point? The point is that the movie is pointless, it's all been done before and, by Ridley Scott at least, far better.",Pandorum
186,YellowTea,Better Than I Thought,7,12 September 2021,"It succeeds in making you feel like you're aboard the ship, and it succeeds in making you feel like you're in danger with these weird monster things nipping at your heels.Ben Foster gives his usual hopped up blistering performance, and Dennis Quaid makes for a well-cast nutty captain.The one thing that I do find a little annoying is the goofy martial arts, and the done-to-death muted characters who suddenly develop the ability to speak midway during the storyline.Overall, it's a good movie. Think of it as a cross between The Descent, and maybe Event Horizon.",Pandorum
187,znegative,Fun Space-Horror,7,27 June 2016,"Within the last few days, I've found that I am a fan of the space-genre movies. I love both science fiction and horror, so I suppose that makes sense.I'll keep this review short, but I enjoyed this movie a lot. If you liked the 'Alien' movies, 'Event Horizon' and 'Sphere', this will be right up your alley. Even if you're not so much a horror-fan per say, but enjoy science fiction, you'll probably enjoy Pandorum too.I wouldn't say the plot of Pandorum is really all that original. A crew wakes up after a suspended period of hyper sleep without any recollection of their past, or why they're on board a massive ship, and then, surprise surprise, they come to find out that they're not alone. I've heard someone else compare it to 'The Descent' in space, and that's pretty accurate.What makes the movie good is it's ability to immerse the viewer into a very cool looking and scary world (er, ship more like). I was also impressed with the special effects in Pandorum. Unlike a lot of modern Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies, this one seems to rely more on make-up and cool sets, rather then CGI animation. IMO, old school special effects are a lot more convincing, if sometimes flawed, as they seem more grounded in reality. CGI tends to look too smooth, and weightless.I would say this one was definitely worth the 3.99 I paid to watch it on Amazon.",Pandorum
188,whosyourdrummer1,Great Movie,8,1 October 2009,"This movie was amazing on so many levels. It took a rather simplistic story line and turned it into something phenomenal. It also kept a good balance of suspense mixed in with telling the story, because honestly the movie starts off with a bang and no character development whatsover. This movie proved that this isn't always a bad thing. Ben Foster is a great actor, and I've always wanted to see movies that he's in and this one didn't disappoint at all. Cam Giganget also had a nice addition to this limited cast. The twist of the story kept coming, and my friends and I were extremely pleased with the way things turned out in the end.",Pandorum
189,SubZeroMK,"Event Horizon meets Dead Space, they had a baby, and this is what came out.",10,10 November 2009,"First of all, the opening for this movie was amazing, I loved the graphics on the opening credits and end credits. Those were great.Another beautiful thing about this movie is how it reminds me of the video game, Dead Space, and the 1997 movie, Event Horizon. It's like that video game and that movie had sex, Dead Space got pregnant, and their prodigy is this movie. All original, and very well done. Just imagine if you had Stanley Kubrick alive today, and he was called on this project, man it would be crazy.I can't wait till I get it on blu-ray. The special effects were nice, the sound was even nicer, and Ben Foster has proved to me that he can act extremely well. I never liked the actor..or more importantly, the characters he plays. I always thought his characters were unstable, bi-polar sociopaths. In this one, he wasn't, he was the hero, but he had something cynical about him. It's thanks to this movie that I like the actor now. He's pretty badass. Dennis Quad was really great as well. I kinda wish he wasn't the bad guy because I was rooting for him, but he played his part very well. But for 40 million dollars, this movie had some great special effects and excellent sound editing, and again I say, for 40 million dollars. A sci-fi movie these days has to have a budget of 100 to 200 or more million dollars. 80 million at least. But this just proved that even with a small budget, you can do anything you want. The director has some very good budget management skills that's for sure.So to conclude this review. It's a moderately paced action sci-fi with a twist to it, and if you loved dead space and event horizon, you'll love this movie even more. 10/10 for originality, acting, good use of budget on special effects, sound, and everything else. Hopefully this movie will get more appreciation on IMDb and everywhere else, because it deserves to be in the top 250.",Pandorum
190,lord-of-the-lez,Rollercoaster Ride,7,4 July 2018,"This is a rollercoaster ride of a movie! It starts out a bit slow, but once it gets going, it never stops. There are so many twists and turns that you can't exactly predict how the plot will unfold. At some point, it starts to feel like an adventure movie from the 80s or 90s with an ensemble cast and characters in set roles and I felt this made the movie feel a bit silly at times. And some of the acting can feel a bit hokey and over-the-top, which weakens the more serious moments. However, the sci-fi elements are superb! It takes bits and pieces from other horror and sci-fi films, but arranges them in an interesting way. It has some truly terrifying ""OH SHIT"" moments. If you enjoy movies like Alien, The Thing, and Apollo 13, you'll really love this!",Pandorum

192,micz81,Best SF mix I have seen in years,7,27 February 2010,"I think box-office failure of this one was caused by crappy advertising. Posters are set in the tone of ""Starship Troopers"" or ""Crank"" or ""Saw"" and they doesn't resemble the soul of this movie. At all. So if you want to see Pandorum, but you feel stink from the posters - don't be afraid, it's only a poster. Movie is better.In few words: Pandorum has splendid sets and design, gooooood acting (Ben Foster especially gives power to this movie), and most important - strong directing and quite good script with few kinda' freshy concepts.The script has only one major flaw - too much talking. This story is a great pretext to create almost silent movie. It would be a challenge to tell the plot almost without talking, but I'm sure it could have been done good. And THEN we would get a fresh movie! Instead we have something more hollywoodish, but still attractive and wort watching.Director Christian Alvart knows how to thrill. I've watched this movie on rather bad DivX copy and shitty speakers and still was climbing the armchair in few moments. Very good sense of suspense. DVD or Blue-Ray should emphasize those experiences.But good directing isn't much when your cast is shitty. Respect goes here to Ben Foster and Denis Quaid who assist the director in gaining the right feel of the movie. Female lead Antje Traue was a nice choice too. She jumps over the over-played ""strong female character"" known from times of Sigounrey Weaver's Ripley and plays here in very simple, yet realistic manner. It adds some very needed reality feel to the story. In the opposite we have Eddie Rouse whose theatrical acting - either it was director's choice or his own - doesn't fit here, and spoils the mood.To complete the picture we have here very very very good design and nicely created and lighted sets, without joy-killing ""cardboard feel"". It helps again the story to be more believable. But we have to remember that I watched it on DivX, so It could be worse in better quality.This whole bunch of things is nicely photographed and edited so the final package WILL make you happy.Summing up - be prepared for some deja-vu from time to time (for example ""The Descent"" [2005], ""Event Horizon"" [1997], ""Creep"" [2004]), but it's a good mix for sure and if you are looking for dark Science Fiction in the tone (tone, not level) of Alien, I definitely recommend you this title.",Pandorum
193,eugenia_loli,One of the top-3 space horror films ever made,10,7 September 2021,"Pandorum is among the top-3 space horror films ever made (the other two being Event Horizon, and Alien). There is mystery, action, and lots of pumping adrenaline. Some say that the ideas are derivative, but I don't think that this is a problem on this film, since there are many twist and turns, especially in the end. It's known ideas, but weaved the right way. Other films in this category have not done that. Ignore the clueless critics who gave it really low scores when the film came out in 2009, this film has aged very well, and I hope it becomes a cult hit. I hope we also see a 4k rescan version of it sometime soon.",Pandorum
194,metallipowerman5000,"Not into sci-fi's, but this was great!",8,8 January 2010,"Alrite, like the title says, not usually into these kind of movies, but this one has to be an exception. Basically there are a few flight crew left on the ship, no memory except for their training. They find blood thirsty mutants running around, and now they must get to the ships nuclear reactor before the ship permanently loses power and they are stuck in space forever.This movie reminded me a lot of several movies. It reminded me of Doom, because of the extremely dark scenes throughout the movie and the fact that they are in outer space, the ship seemed similar to the moonbase. -It reminded me of Descent, because of the monsters/mutants, and the killing scenes and the dark and weird camera angles. -It had the feel of a few other movies too, but I could go on and on.This is a VERY well made movie, tons of scary edge of your seat moments. It also has plenty of weird moments that don't make any sense. The overall journey as the crew tries to make their way through the ship actually makes you feel like your in the movie. Just tons of little moments and small details, it just sucks you right into the movie! It's kind of hard to describe, but a lot of other sci-fi or horror movies make me lose interest or I'm somehow able to feel separate from the movie. Often times yelling "" oh BS! That's not real, that wouldn't happen in real life! What an idiot, I would never do that!""But this movie is in the depths of space, so it's hard to just imagine yourself being somewhere else or even losing interest in the movie. There's no saying "" oh I would do this or that differently"". Your in space in a giant spacecraft, you are forced to deal with the reality of the situation, no matter how sane or insane it may seem!One thing I keep hearing is, how many plot twists there are in this movie. I think that is miss-leading. I don recall many twists, other than a few weird mental breakdown parts with a character or two. The ending sort of has a nice surprise, but i wouldn't call it a twist.But that doesn't change anything, this movie is a very raw sci-fi action thriller.This movie hammers out very strong with a psychotic numbing effect in the beginning. And it follows through with very real moments of what it's like to be hunted by a species that's superior in instinctive killing, while trying to escape to the next temporary safe area. And it ends with more action and a nice surprise. For such a dark action movie, I must say, I enjoyed the ending scene a lot!It's a very solid movie, and if you're into sci-fi, monster or zombie movies, or thriller or dark action movies, you will love this movie.",Pandorum
195,Erichnathanbennett,Suspense scary worth it,7,20 May 2010,Pandorum is a great film. I thought it looked stupid to pay to go see it in theaters but when I saw it on HBO or something like that I thought it was stupid of me not to see it in theaters. Pandorum is not one of those movies that is just barely held together by a string and then collapses at the end. It's pretty consistent and even throughout the whole movie wit a decent ending.Also one of my friends saw it in theaters and he heard this guy say that it was dumb and how one of the characters was too dramatic. Sure I'll admit the movie had some flaws but name one movie where it was flawless. Also any movie that I've seen I know what rating it got (out of 4 stars). Do u know what the critics gave it? 1 out of 4 stars. Unbelievable. I know that critics criticize all movies that's why they're called critics but cmon. Were they drunk?If you haven't seen pandorum go see it cause like I said it's worth it. And one more thing. Don't eat anything before or during the movie. I had to learn it the hard way.,Pandorum

I was surprised to hear that it actually played in cinema. The acting is very good. The mystery keeps you interested, all the way through. There are many ways a sequel could go, it's a superb story, I would've liked to have received more of it. They must have done a bad job with the advertising, it flopped in cinema, so that is why we haven't gotten a sequel - Most people who I spoke with, had never heard of the movie.

The storyline isn't very interesting, a bunch of zombie or weird looking creatures chasing you? And all you need to do is run? How did the humans who were awake earlier survive for so many days/months/years/whatever without proper food/hygiene? And the female character was jumping around like some sort of a cat? Sigh!!

199,politically_incorrect204,Surprisingly Well Done,9,27 January 2010,"Normally I don't bother with writing reviews because there's already enough that express the same sentiment I had. And while I think there are already a fair amount of people who share my thoughts on this film I was so pleasantly surprised by how good it was I thought I'd do it the favor of writing a positive review. I won't go into every agonizing narrative detail about the film. I will just say that while it does have some typical sci-fi attributes I would definitely say it proves itself worthy of the viewers attention. First of all the acting was great. Great cast even in the small roles. Ben Foster is excellent again and Dennis Quaid is convincing and surprisingly forceful and manic at times. So that always helps when you can rely on the actors to do things well. The script is actually quite original. It takes some familiar sci-fi components and then mixes them up into a very original take on sci-fi. Some ideas I would say are completely original, so kudos, since sci-fi has to be one of the most rehashed genres out there. That being said great story, I liked how there were two simultaneous story arcs that were both very compelling and had you both wanting to know what happened next or what something meant. Its hard to enough to find one good story people want to follow but two is even better. The creatures were well done as well, believable, scary, and vaguely original. My only small criticism is I felt some moments were strongly borrowed from The Descent. Just little ques here and there, objects, creatures, scenes. These may have been homage to that wonderful film, or perhaps just miscues by the director. Either way by films end I was very happy I'd taken the time out to watch it and will be definitely watching this movie again some time.",Pandorum

Not to say it's bad, simply different in how it presents itself. Gets off to a slow start, but quickly picks up when the bad guys are introduced, and bad they are. Thankfully, there aren't too many characters to get attached to, so the movie becomes standard Sci-Fi fare with lots of running through dark tunnels and the occasional triple-team on a monster. Quaid is really good as a disoriented Lieutenant of a doomed flight to find new life...the rest of the cast...not so much. Nice little twist at the end that puts lots of things into perspective.

There's a lot of Aliens as well although the ""Aliens"" in this movie aren't nearly as terrifying as the Xenomorphs in James Cameron's movie.Lots of undertones and subtle hints COULD have helped me spot the ending but I have to admit, I've missed them all completely.

206,jormatuominen,Space horror for the thinking person,9,24 June 2016,"I have watched the film twice and I'm glad. The first time I did what the besserwissers do and spent my time counting the sci-fi and horror clichés the film uses. Admittedly there is a lot, and I was especially annoyed by the aggressive creatures. They looked like underfed Mad Max extras to me, OK in a zombie movie but really unimaginative as space monsters go. The second time I was able to focus on what the film in itself is all about. The plot is extremely well thought out from the beginning, where a man wakes up with no memories on a rather empty spaceship, to the surprising and completely original ending. Being a European film, there is no sloppy writing. Layer by layer the strange world of the believable giant space vessel starts to make more sense. Suspense is built slowly but not too slowly. You will be scared out of your wits also suddenly and when you do not see it coming. The character do response emotionally. The actors depict it well, perhaps slipping into over-acting a couple of times, but hey, what's over-acting on a doomed spaceship? After all the core of the film is how to retain your sanity in extreme circumstances, and here they are pretty extreme. All in all, Pandorium adds a lot of new and thought- provoking twists to the space sci-fi horror genre, if you just give it a chance. I'd give it a ten but for the Mad Max extras. I still hate them.",Pandorum
207,Lunaroseice,Better than Event Horizon,7,24 December 2010,"I liked Event Horizon. I like this film better because it made a little more sense in the end.I watched it in three segments. Mostly because it was too dark for most of the film and more gore than I care for. The concept was good, the acting good, the writing good. The only flaw was in the execution.I struggled on through the gore to find out how everything would tie together in the end. I liked the explanation of where the 'monsters' came from but found myself curious as to why genetic treatments (that were supposed to help them adapt to the new planet) caused those that were woken up early to adapt to the ship environment in those particular ways. I love the way it ends with all the undisturbed sleeper pods bouncing up out of the ocean and people sitting up and enough people surviving to still have a large, diverse, genetic population to start a viable colony.So while I do wish so much of it wasn't so dark and dirty and gory, I still think it is a film worth watching.",Pandorum
208,themightyservo,"Quaid, I mean Foster, Start the Reactor!",9,6 August 2010,"I watched this on DVD and just finished it a few minutes ago. The film is still fresh in my mind, and left me with a feeling of ""man, that was worth it!"" It's a good, solid piece of entertaining film. I went in with zero expectations and was very pleasantly surprised.The film offers solid performances from Quaid, Foster, and the rest, though it isn't going to be an Oscar candidate (no sci-fi ever is anyway, but I digress). The film does some character development, mostly as characters remember who/what they were. It's not Anna Karenina or Gone With The Wind, though. It's a lost spaceship movie.The film has the mood that's portrayed on the back of the DVD box. It's a claustrophobic lost spaceship flick - very direct. If you like that type of movie to begin with (Alien, Event Horizon, Sphere, etc.), you'll probably find yourself enjoying it. If you don't, you still might like it anyway.If you're a sci-fi snob demanding that ""The Wreck of the River of Stars"" be made into a 10-hour miniseries, then go read a book an tell us how dumb we are for enjoying movies. (River of Stars is about a doomed sailboat in space. You get this from reading the title and the first page. Hell, the title tells you what's going to happen.)Pandorum has a couple of turns in the plot that make it really interesting. I won't call anything a ""twist"" or ""reveal"" because that makes it seem like a cheap showman's trick, and Pandorum really does tell a good story.There are a few parts where I found myself thinking I'd seen something like it before, and there are some derivative elements. But so what? What it borrows from is good entertainment, and it uses much of it to good effect - sometimes better effect.Is it the greatest sci-fi ever? Certainly not. Is it derivative? Sure, somewhat, but everything is. Haters gonna hate. There are some flaws - one scene specifically that may leave the audience going ""why would you do that?"" - but even one really dumb move by the characters didn't dissuade me from enjoying the film. You'll know it when you get to it, and just roll with it - the movie's worth ignoring one bit of bad writing. There are some other flaws for nitpickers, and the action scenes suffer from rampant ramping, but it's nothing intolerable, and the story carries on despite giving nits to pick.There are a few small, VERY creative, very unique special effects that add to the mood of the film. There are also some unique character traits that mix up the film a bit, plus the title space-sickness ""Pandorum"".All in all, if you rent it or Netflix it or find it for $10 at Walmart, it's worth it.I'd give it 7 1/2 stars, but I'm trying to offset the hater 1s.",Pandorum

It reminded me of Event Horizon and as a fan of sci-fi films in that style I immediately put it on my high priority list. I can't say I was disappointed. People may say the 'zombies' that attack them are out of nowhere but there is a good reason for them being on the ship if you watch the film long enough to find out. I found myself glued to the screen as the story unfolded and I thoroughly enjoyed it up to the 'happy ending' where Ben Foster's character managed to get out of the ship taking the survivors with him. I will definitely be buying this and I will be looking for other films of it's type too. Excellent viewing.,Pandorum
210,FJWWindsor,Get to the Reactor!,7,30 August 2017,"Pandorum is a refreshing hybrid film combining science fiction and horror, and really hits its mark in terms of being entertaining. Time and attention was taken to develop an interesting backstory, and a decent script helps move the film along at a consistent clip. A great acting team helps develop characters you actually care for, and the sets are murky and brilliant. The creatures come across as menacing, though I didn't care for the accelerated motion filming, as it was annoying in its overuse. CGI and FX were more than passable but were not the central focus of the film, as they are with many sci-fi and horror flicks these days.However, what I found really interesting is the film makers study in contrasts. For example, the trek starting in a dystopian world to the development of technology enabling long distance space flight, and then back to the primal need for basic human survival. Several references were made to the size of the ship, carrying not only some 1200 human passengers, but thousands of species of animals.

I was disappointed that Norman Reedus (Daryl from The Walking Dead) was only on screen for a few minutes, his inclusion one of the reasons I looked forward to watching this. The whole pandorum concept is interesting though, insanity resulting from to much time in stasis, and the ending IS pretty decent. Overall, can't recommend.",Pandorum
213,NousPax-1,Mental and Physical Aberrations in Space.,8,30 November 2009,"Dennis Quaid is excellent in this Sci-Fi horror mystery thriller. Other characters are not well known, but they give an excellent performance.Ambiance is very good in this too. There are some very horrible beasties in this. Some excellent surprise including the climax but that will not be revealed here. In the early part of this film, I nearly cringed when it showed ""flyby"" views of the monsters. That's where they go by so fast that you cannot focus on them. That irritates me greatly and make me feel like shutting the movie off immediately, but am glad I stuck with this because it turned out very good overall. Pandorum shows at the beginning that it is set about 160 years in the future and the Earth's population is over 24 billion. A distant habitable planet has been found and the ship is on a long journey to it. The ship appears to be miles long, as it can hold thousands of people. The science behind the mission and it's objective is well presented and sensible. The major twist in this is almost impossible to guess and some surprise scenes are very unexpected. Great Sci-Fi horror mystery!",Pandorum
214,sahamh,Underrated Thriller Scifi,8,17 July 2013,"Directed by Christian Alvart and written by Travis Milloy, and I totally had forgotten about this movie, I just remember seeing its trailer back in 2009, but I wasn't interested at that time, however I got curious again since Antje Traue is in it.The story is interesting; a spaceship that's on its way to the new Earth is lost with thousands of passengers, and a lot of crap happens around this gigantic spaceship. It obviously has some of the old, cliché of the ""jump scares,"" but the story gets more thriller and intense as the movies goes on, and I absolutely LOVE the third act; some of the twists are predictable, but they're presented very well. One thing bothers me the actions the characters take at each other when they interact with each other at first, it absolutely doesn't make sense, but on the other hands, the intensity of it and the action scenes are entertaining. Another element that surprises me in this movie is the soundtrack; I really appreciate it when a proper soundtrack is done for such movies. The performances are fine honestly - I only thought Cam Gigandet was over acting, but I think it is necessary for the story.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, more than I expected in fact, and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a thriller scifi, I give it 7.5/10.",Pandorum

The story constantly twists and turns, and throughout the movie you slowly unravel the mystery of what is happening. The tone is perfect; it is dark, damp, dirty, wet, slimy, creepy, and feels isolated. The atmosphere is almost like that of the ""Doom"" or ""Dead Space"" video games. There is a constant feeling of dread and the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is perfect, switching back and forth between sequences of gory monster fights and psychological mystery. Some of the twists are cliché and not unseen before in other movies, but they are presented in a way that is very original. The creatures are scary, but they are not what holds the film together. What holds the film together is the amalgamation of great story telling and cleverly constructed pacing and twists. The climax is very intense and the ending was perfectly fitting. While certain story elements do feel slightly forced, Pandorum is still a terrific thriller that sci-fi fans should check out.",Pandorum
216,grandfunkfan,Pandorum is a great sci-fi movie,8,6 February 2010,"I started to say that Pandorum was a great sci-fi horror movie, but I realized that wasn't necessary. Sci-f deals with the unknown, and the unknown can be horrible. I would also advise readers to ignore the naysayers that compare Pandorum to other movies. Take it on its own merits as a good sci-fi movie.The mutants in Pandorum, as well as the 'normal' humans, are all just creatures trying to survive in the environment they've found themselves in. The mutants surely have the advantage, because they have developed and grown up in the cargo ship. The sleepers on the other hand, expected to wake up to a peaceful, controlled environment headed toward a new beginning or a continuance of mankind. What a horrible shock the sleepers woke up to instead: they didn't know where they were, they didn't know how long they had been asleep or how far they had traveled, they didn't know if their breeding companions (a.k.a. loved ones) had survived, etc.The unknown can be horrible. Sci-fi can be horrible. Many attempts at creating horror through the genre of sci-fi have been horribly disappointing. However, Pandorum is a very entertaining movie with many twists and shocks that should hold the interest of a sci-fi or action enthusiast throughout.",Pandorum
217,glen-88,Pan-dreadful,4,3 October 2009,"The psychological terror the film wishes to instill on us comes up short - not due to the basic plot or premise but to the dreadful homogenized editing and directing.Pandorum is not a bad film as far as story goes - certainly there a lot worse premises for a film out there and this little yarn is original in how it explains the presence of the unnamed nasties on the ship. But what it fails so miserably in is something that should be film-making 101 to any competent director...exposition...there's almost none. No sooner have we met a crew on board some sort of flying death trap than we find everyone and everything has run amok.And while the answers are quickly given to us (much much later in Act 2) they are quickly hashed through and then just as quickly dropped.The fact that the evil meanies on board are some sort of evolutionary hybrid gone awry because every astronaut is given a magic serum that adapts human DNA is barely mentioned very late into the film and because of this feels pretty tacked on. If it had been brought about earlier it would have given the film much more suspense.The ship actually being underwater on the Tanis (or whatever its called) planet is a neat little twist at the end but it doesn't make up for the bad lighting and little to no character development...two of the surviving crew come across as little more than grunting exotic warriors who's ultimate sacrifices make no difference to us.Dennis Quaid is a welcome addition but even he can't sustain the mire of character arcs that at one moment pit him against a younger insane crew member and at another moment make him akin to a babbling Jack Nicholson in the Shining.The thing with thrillers is you have to be invested in the characters before you feed them to the wolves, and when feeding them to said wolves, leaving everything a total mystery up until the very end is a little amateurish...real suspense builds on what facts are already known.Unfortunately Pandorum's creators didn't take the time they could have in creating any suspense and so the whole thing feels like a rehash of Aliens, Event Horizon, and a dozen other films, except not quite as good.5/10 stars for the basic premise, the set design and a very few nice visuals.",Pandorum

I'm pleased to say it didn't. Whilst it's a horror movie, it's not overly gory and there's plenty of action, even if the scenes are hard to follow because of the quick cutting between camera angles.It's not going to win Oscars but even though there were blood hungry mutants which stretch the bounds of probability and there were echoes of other space horror movies, it's more believable and enjoyable than some of the earthbound movies I saw in the last year.The plot is not that complicated but there are a couple of nice twists which keep it rolling along and which differentiate it from the standard horror.

It's later explained they're on a seed ship, a kind of Noah's Ark destined to colonise another planet after Earth has used up its natural resources. Oh, and they find they're not alone on the ship. Think Event Horizon with added aliens - and with Paul WS Anderson's producer's credit you've got some idea of what to expect. Director Christian Alvart deserves kudos here though, because he manages to balance the increasing paranoia of the surviving crew with the fighting action experienced between the humans and the hunters without making the whole thing seem too ridiculous. Antje Traue provides a bit of eye candy - the poor man's Asia Argento really, and Eddie Rouse plays the token nutter-who-speaks-the-truth down to a tee. The tension's not notched up anywhere near as high as it could have been, but with the mix of action and plot-driving scenes it never gets boring.

I don't think this film is incredible, or any superlatives like that - but it is very watchable and it worth the 90 minutes if just for the beautifully staged finish.I think Foster's performance is the one that shines through - and his honest delivery of his lost character and the claustrophobic struggle he faces is well suited to the film's style.At times I couldn't help but feel the film slightly bordered on cliches and action film goofiness but it often kept on the straight and narrow with the cool plot developments and character twists.*Spoiler* My favourite part of the film is definitely the final 10 minute section with the final conflict involving Bowers, Nadia and Payton (or Gallo even?) and then Bowers and Nadia's escape to the ocean's surface. I think having been through 90 minutes of utter darkness, you feel a similar sense of relief to them - and that's credit to the way the film was set up and delivered.Good job overall. Can see why it is become a sci-fi cult classic.",Pandorum

As he recovers his memory by finding his belongings, he realizes that something's wrong with the ship's reactor and is decided to go and fix it. But he's not alone This is one of these movies that has a visual style that stand out in an unique – and good - way. It reminds me of 00s horror videogames, with a mix of green and blue tinted light and an overall darkness. Apart from that, the movie sets in some parts of the spaceship, but there's no views of the outside or something that makes that the're inside of a ship believable. Sometimes it looks like there's a set of rooms, one after the other, and almost the whole movie is about going from the first to the last and back.This movie has good characters, with a lot of personality and strong roles in the plot. Though the whole movie we can see how a squad forms not because of affinity, because the kind of need each other and they believe in Bower and his mission. If I had to pick up a favorite character from this movie it would probably be Nadia, because she's just badass.The plot is maybe one of it's weakest points, being good in some cases and leaving holes and some others. After watching the film I found myself thinking that some things didn't really make sense or at least they didn't look right. Maybe rewatching this movie would make this better, since this movie is one of those that you can watch over and over again without getting tired.

I was wrong. I must say I was pleasantly surprised in every way. First of all, Don't let the casting of Dennis Quad discourage you from watching this film because his role is minor and Ben Foster is amazing. Secondly, The set design, plot, lighting, and character development is great and this movie sucks you in and will leave you thinking about it later. I really enjoy when a director and his crew take the time to construct REAL sets/backgrounds as opposed to all the CGI used today. The acting was above average and the creature designs were very believable, not campy or corny. It is too bad this movie did not get the promotional funding it deserved as it would probably made more money at the box office and spawned sequels.

225,simmmz,I would rename this 'Panboredom'.,1,11 October 2010,"I was lured towards 'Pandorum' with the expectation of a good value science fiction/horror. But nay, was this poor-trite Ben Foster plays astronaut Corporal Bower, who wakes up on a desolate spacecraft, all alone, with no memory of who he is and how he got there. Whilst exploring the forsaken ship, he comes across fellow survivors and an evil presence that slaughters them one by one.The premise of 'Pandorum' is reminiscent of 'Event Horizon', 'Alien', 'The Descent', 'Sunshine' and numerous other sci-fi/horror affairsand it has absolutely no new ideas. But a genre film is a genre film, and that's not what makes 'Pandorum' bad.German director, Christian Alvart, creates a despairing and unsettling tone that is effective in the first 10 minutes of the film. It reminded me a lot of Alien 3 (which I consider a pretty awful film too). But Fincher, Alvart ain't. 'Pandorum' rapidly deteriorates into an awful mess. I knew this was going no-where fast, but alas, it went beyond nowhere into another stratosphere of shiite-ness. The action sequences were impossible to make sense of, the art design was tacky, the creatures looked SO nonthreatening and false, and the ending was a real fizzer. It has an awful visual style to boot, and character development = zill.Being impressed with Ben Foster on 'Six Feet Under', this was such a disappointment for someone I always saw as an up-and-coming star. He is utterly forgettable. And god knows why Dennis Quaid signed onto this.This is complete trash, but not of the enjoyable, tongue in cheek kind. It is very rare that I feel compelled to walk out of a film before it ends. I want to get my money's worthbut after 45 minutes, I was completely unengaged and there is absolutely nothing to reel you back in. 'Pandorum'? I would rename this 'Panboredom'.

It starts out with some good acting when a couple of crew members wake up after ""hypersleep"" on board a space ship. It starts to get scary when they find no trace of the other crew members or passengers. Ben Foster has some claustrophobic travels through a duct system to get out of the room with a door that will not open. After emerging from the ducts he finds monsters that look like regurgitated zombies or vampires or something. The monsters look like they just stepped out of QT's From Dusk Till Dawn. He also finds a group of cretins who have survived the zombies but seem determined to kill all the other people instead of banding together to fight them. The people are passengers who look like they just stepped off the set of Mad Max.

Not The Shawshank Redemption but not bad either. A sequel will probably spoil it because the gritty psychological drama taking place within the ship was unique and could not be re-attained unless the plot is repeated verbatim.

The idea the character knows about as much as the viewer is the real ""catching point"". I found myself watching this movie from beginning to end with complete focus. Thats just my initial reaction.Witehn the first half an hour you'll start asking questions about the movie, as in whats going on, who's who etc. This is excellent cause it creates a bond between story and viewer.Excellent cast delivers amazing performances, as well as a few new faces appear who ALL really bring on a triple a performance.THe story, Phenomenal. A combination of Event Horizon, Dead Space, Aliens,and ghosts of mars blend perfectly, while staying unique in its own little way. Not once will you find yourself uninterested in this movie.Exciting is an understatement as I found it hard not to keep wondering whats next and whats going on. A lot of people say Paranormal activity is scary and such. NOT, that movie was a bunch of silly wires and fans. This movie has genuine spook moments which not only frighten but induce a sense of paranoia which blends effortlessly with the story. Everything feels like it belongs not forced.So with fear of giving away any plot (believe me its worth discovering on your own) I have to say the ending is AWESOME. Im so sick of movies these days coming out of the gate strong but finishing at a slow crawl almost making people wish they hadn't even seen it. This ending is NOT the case. it not only was a major 'WOAH' moment but offered some closer WHILE giving excellent potential for a sequel.Overall excellent acting, GREAT scripting, awesome effects (and not over done with excess of cg, in fact from what i could tell only a few shots used any cg at all), Phenomenal ending , OUTSTANDING plot curves and twists , and yeah all I can say JUST WOW!

233,richardmarkham42,"Rather ponderous, but effectively gruesome",7,23 October 2017,"I watched this time-shifted on TV - not in HD - and concede that I may not have been seeing it at its best. I like scifi movies and TV but would not say I am an addict, nor an expert. I would liken this production to a cross between small-screen miniseries ""Ascension"" (mainly in its basic idea of a ship designed to colonise a new Earth) and the Alien franchise (in its atmosphere and setting). There are certain scenes familiar from the likes of ""Sphere"" and other such and in some ways there are even parallels with ""The Wizard of Oz""! For me Ben Foster is very strong in the lead role and Dennis Quaid also convinces. It is just as well because most of the other players who matter have peremptory dialogue and the bulk of the other ""lifeforms"" who inhabit the ship are interchangeable and genuinely nasty zombie-like apparitions with only one thing on their agenda. For too long, the movie drags us through somewhat repetitious encounters between our hero and the many hazards he encounters, but the basic story is clever and intriguing, with several twists that eluded me, not least at the end. Given that the budget will have been a fraction of that thrown at the Alien franchise, the sets, lighting and special effects are impressive and for the most part look real. There is also a solid futuristic score - crucial in movies like this. In the end, we have here a very decent effort at generating a cult picture that might yet be remade into a scifi masterpiece. Well worth your time, if you don't easily get queasy (or do and enjoy it)!",Pandorum

237,anonveli,Severely underrated Sci-Fi/Horror,8,27 September 2017,"I saw this movie some years back and it always kind of stuck out in my mind. I think it quickly fell off the radar and never really got the kind of attention it deserved, because it is most definitely underrated. Sci-fi horror/thriller movies are becoming more common now, but they don't always hit the mark. The premise of this movie is that a flight team crew member (Bower played by Ben Foster) aboard a passenger ship for a new planet awakens to a seemingly empty ship. He awakens his lieutenant (Payton played by Dennis Quaid) so that their shift can begin and they can unravel the mystery surrounding the state of the ship. Here's the spoiler free rundown.The Good: A successful a sci-fi movie takes the time to immerse you in the world that exists as the characters see it. Part of that is showing off all that fancy-dancy, non-existent future technology. In this case we get to see the lazer-razor, holographic computer systems, hibernation chambers and of course a ****ing wrist-mounted plasma cannon. Okay, okay it's a non-lethal riot plasma cannon but whatever, it's still pretty cool. Pandorum at times reminded me a bit of Dead Space (probably because of the plasma cannon) and that's not a bad thing.This movie is drenched in atmosphere that will make you feel claustrophobic and alone. It was done completely right since there are very rare moments in the movie that are completely well lit. It hones in on the darkness and uses it to its advantage because as the story unravels further, the horror elements roll out with it. The suspense is worked into almost every scene, constantly nagging at the back of your mind. I love that this movie feels like The Descent meets Passengers. Yes, I know Passengers came out this year so the two are unrelated but it's really the only comparison I can make. It also has a little humor mixed into it, albeit not much which is probably a good thing considering the setting of the movie.Without giving too much away on the ending, I'll also say that it's one of the few sci-fi/horror movies that has a satisfying ending. I think that's what really made this movie shine for me. A lot of movies that revolve around horror or dark subject matter tend to end very bleak or leave it up to viewer interpretation. This movie is a journey which has a very clear destination that doesn't disappoint.The Bad: The survivors of the ship are all somewhat stereotypical and what you'd expect to see on a ship full of mutated creatures. I guess that's not necessarily the worst thing possible, but the reality is you only care about Bower and Payton for most of the film. At some point, you get to see Norman Reedus before he played Chewba Daryl Dixon in The Walking Dead.Speaking of banding together in dire situations, this was one of the parts that really irritated me. For a big chunk of the early part of the movie there's a lot of mistrust and aggression towards the other survivors until Bower drops the line, ""can we get a little ****ing solidarity here?"". You'd think after years of space-cave babies eating people that the survivors would band together to better the odds. Guess not.Going into the final act of this movie, there are some revelations that will demand that you overlook some plot-holes. The story itself is actually very interesting and a great concept but there's one very specific unrealistic element. There are ways that the hole can be explained away but unfortunately there's nothing in the film that really digs into it. There are also other implications involved with said plot-hole but it's better in this case to just brush it under the rug and consider it a bump in the road for what is otherwise a good movie.The Judgment: If you're into sci-fi/horror this is the movie for you. I love this film and the way that the story comes together. Even with the aforementioned flaw, the movie tells a great story. I'm sure I'm going to upset someone out there with this statement, but I would put this on par with the original Alien. It's certainly not paced like Alien and the monsters are far more vicious, but it manages to capture some of those same feelings of isolation on a ship. While the setting of the story isn't 100% original, the narrative has its own unique spin. This film is definitely worth your time!Check out this review and more at TheCynicist.com",Pandorum

The main star is an unknown (Bill Foster), the female star is pretty enough, but somehow she doesn't fit in, and Dennis Q, as I said,is wasted in this role. 4. Weak plot, far-fetched and unbelievable. 5. For the year 2152 too many items and too many similarities to current years, like the torches, the style of talking, the computer keyboard, the lighting...hey, this is supposed to be 150 years or thereabouts in the future, but judging from the ship interior, their languaqe style etc it would seem to be only a few years ahead in the future. All in all, a movie you can safely give a miss. Watch if your'e bored and got the bluray free.George Menon, Goa",Pandorum
239,joselnieves81,Aliens meet The Descent!!!,6,26 September 2009,"I simply loved the posters for PANDORUM, they were edgy and graphic enough to make me want to give this movie a shot even thou i'm not a Dennis Quaid fan at all. I gave it a shot earlier today and i have to say it was a pretty good movie.PANDORUM is your classic outer space scifi movie which we really haven't had for sometime. I do have to say the aliens kind of reminded me of the creatures in the movie DESCENT just with armor. The movie itself had a feel of the original ALIEN movie. Now to what I enjoyed about this movie was the way the story evolved into a edge of your seat thriller with twist after twist. The story is what separates this from other spaceship, scifi movies. Even leaves the viewer thinking ""what if"" this happens. PANDORUM is a good way to enter this fall season. Great story, good effects, easy story to follow, just enough gore to satisfy everyone and not to much Dennis Quaid to make me happy!",Pandorum
240,Loops2112,"Looked OK, sounded terrible",5,10 January 2016,"This movie showed promise, but went downhill fairly quickly. The sets were good, the picture was good, special effects/CGI good, but the mumbling dialogue really let the whole thing down. How does that happen? When they test screen movies like this, doesn't anyone come out of there admitting that they couldn't work out what the hell they were saying? I watched it with the family (varying ages, no hearing problems!) and all of us said we thought they mumbled. It's such a simple thing to get right in a film and yet they often mess it up. The details of what happened back on Earth, what the illness was, what happened to the crew and passengers.....it could all have done with being explained a bit more clearly. Lastly, and I know it's fantasy, but if you did send a bunch of people off to settle on a new planet, wouldn't you at least ensure that they understood a common language? If I was in charge, I think I would!",Pandorum
241,carolynvargas,Cool science fiction movie.,8,7 June 2018,"If you like science fiction than this is a good film- dare I say even a great one on occasions.

242,emran222,"I was looking forward to it, but......",4,17 September 2010,"It disappointed me, I have been waiting to see ""Pandorum"" for a while now,and it just came out on DVD over here in Australia. I remember seeing the trailers for this movie online and thought wow this is going to be a treat, I also remember reading an article from empire magazine on the behind the scenes stuff and being so excited to see a movie that had echos of ""Event Horizon"" (On of my favorite Sci-Fi horror films ever), after all ""Pandorum"" has the same producers as that film did, and they even mentioned it would echo ""Event Horizon"", and for the most part it does only not as effectively as that movie did, Now don't get me wrong i wasn't expecting a movie exactly the same as ""Event Horizon"", but one that would be as Deep and effective as ""Event Horizon"" or even more so than that movie was, and ""Pandorum"" Just didn't do that for me.PLOT: the plot involves two astronauts played by ""Dennis Quaid"" and ""Ben Foster"" who awaken from a Hypersleep aboard a deserted spacecraft called the ""Elysium"" and neither of these two men remember much of who they are and what their mission is.CONS: Now with a plot like this there is a lot of potential here but the movie has that weird feeling of, the plot works but there's no satisfaction, but some of the main problems come from the the performances of the actors as well as Plot elements which are not developed to their full potential, The acting in this movie fell flat there was not a single interesting character in the movie it's like they were there to just push the plot along but not add important elements such as Mystery or Intrigue to the film. And a lot of plot elements were not developed enough, Particularly the whole Condition of ""Pandorum"" (A psychological breakdown that leads to madness when Travelling in space) now this topic is only touched upon on a few occasions which was not enough to keep me interested, And there's also a Side plot involving Mutants roaming the ship looking for people to eat, another plot point that is not developed in an Interesting or plentiful manner.Another major problem was the film was way too dark and what i mean is that most of the time i could barely see what was happening, and as for the action scenes with the mutants, they were done in that choppy and quick cut style which i really dislike, It just makes it hard to follow an action scene, in fact there were moments when my eyes started to water when watching the action scenes, and there is also a lot of whispering in this movie now granted the whispering was necessary to avoid the attention of the mutants, but the problem was it was hard to make out what the characters were saying half the time, I actually had to put on Subtitles to make out what most of the characters were saying, no joke. Now I know what you're thinking by now you're probably thinking, WOW this movie sounds really bad, Well no, it's not that BAD it's no ""Batman and Robin"" or ""Battlefield Earth"", but it's more of a big Disappointment than a Bad movie, however there are a couple of things in the movie that are actually good.PROS; The Mutants looked good the make up and designs were brilliant so thumbs up to that.The ending was actually very good it ends on a positive note and leaves you with a good feelingAnd the Concept of the plot was great only not executed well.However for me this movie could've been more, and this is just my opinion on the film so overall I'd say Rent the movie yourself and see what you think, but for me the best description for it is; ""The Lights are on But Nobodys Home"" (4/10) (**/*****)",Pandorum
243,mj68538,Did the professional reviewers see a different film?,9,17 October 2018,"Just watched Pandorum for the second time (after a couple of years) and found it every bit as good as the last time I watched it, despite half-remembering the plot.And what a plot it is, suspenseful twisty and horrific (in a psychological way), with a suitably claustrophobic dimly lit set to match it. Admittedly there's not much cgi or grand vistas on display here, but then they're not needed - the dark, enclosed steam-punk setting perfectly matches the on-screen developments. And there's not much gore, but then the horror is all mind-based so once again isn't needed.All in all a fine, low-budget film where IMO the low budget does more to enhance the film than detract from it, and everything about it leaves you glued to the screen, straining to hear the whispered comments, and almost constantly on the edge of your seat.Maybe the film looks less impressive in the cinema than it does on the small screen and maybe then the suspension of disbelief collapses; I can think of no other reason why the pro critics would get their reviews of this film so drastically wrong, unless somebody accidentally played them Battleship rather than the proper movie...? :-)",Pandorum

Add to that a better story, true character development and top class acting and you should be reaching for two things, the light switch and the popcorn.THE MEAT: Moments of obscurity become 'clarity' as the film progresses. While being alone on a space ship can feel very claustrophobic, added elements of surprise generate a lot of genuine fear which does not diminish as the plot unfolds.

So, this is the sort of horror that messes with your head. I think it is the best kind. You get the most thrill out of it. I had a great time watching this film. I bit my nails, I jumped in my seat, but I couldn't tear myself away from the screen even though at times I was terrified to my core. I disagree with those who say that the story is boring.

It was every bit as good as aliens with newer technology and special effects. Sci-fi buffs will like this film. The ending was also satisfying. I have watched a gagillion ""science fiction"" films and I have been disappointed so many times. This one was good! I recommend it to anyone that appreciates the science fiction fundamentals. None of the artsy, intellectual stuff from movies like stalker, solaris etc. and none of the hokey, cheezy stuff from movies like dark star or trancers.

249,TheDeadMayTasteBad,"Pandorum: A terrifying and atmospheric, if flawed, sci-fi odyssey.",8,26 September 2009,"Anybody wanting an intelligent, insightful, or mesmerizing motion picture should readjust they're expectations before walking into Pandorum. There are a few themes here that are interesting and the characters aren't dumb (some are engineers and scientists, after all), but chances are you've already seen these archetypes in countless movies already. As for whom to recommend this film to, if you enjoyed Event Horizon and/or Alien³, there's no reason why you wouldn't find anything to like in this film. However, contrary to what many people have said, Pandorum seems to resemble another film, Eden Log (a French sci-fi/horror picture), much more than either of the previously mentioned. As in Eden Log, our central characters wake up with no memory of how they came to be in their isolated environments. Likewise, they also have to explore an isolated world around them were horrible things have occurred and monsters seem to be looming. Even more interesting is that both films feature protagonists caught up in the mix of highly mysterious projects entitled ""Eden."" Our two main characters are Corporal Bower and Lt. Payton, played by Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid respectively. The two wake up disoriented and contained (i.e. trapped) in a small hypersleep chamber designated for the Elysium (the name of the large vessel of characters are aboard) crew of Flight Team 5. Unaware of what has happened to the other crew members the two begin to analyze their situation and Bower, being a technical/mechanical engineer, notices electrical surges throughout the ship signal that the nuclear reactor core in the Elysium is about to overload and shutdown. The two begin a makeshift mission to try to save the ship, with Bower climbing through ducts and exploring the wasteland left of the craft and Payton guiding him over a comlink and a crank-generator powered computer terminal. If you've seen any of the Alien films or played the videogames Doom or Dead Space, this should sound quite familiar.Oh, yeah, and there's monsters aboard, though I won't reveal what these ""monsters"" are for potential viewers that don't know yet.To Pandorum's credit, however, there are a few unforeseen plot twists before the credits roll. Some audience members may roll they're eyes at the ending, but I find it's a rather nice addition to the experience. Instead of a big, epic final battle with an Alien Queen, you get a heavy plot-reveal in the finale that causes some reflection upon the film. While it may be no masterpiece, Pandorum is not a bad film. 2009 has been a surprisingly good year for sci-fi thus far (Star Trek, Moon, District 9) and this certainly doesn't detract from that. In terms of horror, Pandorum should be a breath or fresh air for those who've endured films like Halloween II and The Final Destination for the past few weeks. In fact, I'd say Pandorum is the second best horror film of the year thus far, not quite matching the entertainment value or overall quality of Raimi's epic return to the genre (Drag Me To Hell).In terms of film-making, this is a rather well put together film. The cinematography looks great with the exception of a few action sequences that go overboard with the ""quick-cutting,"" but over-all audiences won't have to worry aboard an abundance of shaky-cam or other cons. Also, everything here is properly lit. Those who had trouble with their eyes focusing on images during Eden Log won't have that issue here. This film also doesn't meander around in complete darkness for as long.Director Christian Alvart obviously has a lot of talent and I'm glad he directed this film as opposed to someone like, say, producer Paul W.S. Anderson. He really knows how to handle suspense and build up intense scenes. Like Neil Marshall, he can place his actors in tight, unattractive situations with monsters crawling right beside them (or vice versa) and have the audience holding their breath. Hopefully he'll garner more work in the future.As we now know, Pandorum has tanked at the Box Office. While on one hand that's disappointing, it's not all together terrible news as the film might garner some sort of cult status in the future. In interviews only a week ago, Quaid discussed the possibilities of not only a sequel, but a trilogy following Pandorum. Not only is that seemingly impossible now, given the films performance, it additionally doesn't seem necessary. The film ends with a complete sense of closure. There's no need to see what happens after we leave this world, and such a story wouldn't resemble the experience in Pandorum in the slightest anyway.All-in-all, the latest spacey sci-fi/horror epic has everything you could want in a ""genre"" picture. It's not original (admittedly, this is simply a collage of other, better films), but so little is in the 21st century. The film does feature a solid cast that deliver solid performances, thick atmosphere, several scares, a few unexpected twists, astonishing special effects and set pieces, and quite a bit of gore. If you are a fan of the sub-genre and these type of movies, you'll definitely want to check it out.Runtime: 106 minutes (1 hr. 46 min.) Related Recommendations: It!

The editing, especially the fight scenes, is bizarre - it feels like there are missing clips or frames as we jump into one scene to another. Sloppy editing?

It's the kind of flick critics tend to frown upon while audiences tend to relish through and through. Well, not quite any audience. If you've enjoyed movies like 'The Descent', '30 Days of Night' or 'The Midnight Meat Train', then know 'Pandorum' is a bit of each and then some. If neither rings a bell, do pass it up.It's brutal, it's gloomy, it's relentless and above all it's got a nice little story to tell on top of all that creature-related fun and frolic. And while we're on the creature subject, Stan Winston's company (R.I.P.) was on the job. Even though they borrowed heavily from 'The Descent' there, the creature kinetics was great. Acting was also way above par as both Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid delivered great, sustained performances throughout. One final word on the directing side. As I understand this was Christian Alvart's only significant job he's landed so far. Judging by the way he's handled Pandorum, he's bound to make it big. Fingers crossed, Chris.With its winding post-apocalyptic story and that bleak, dense, impending doom Alien-like feel to it, 'Pandorum' was one of the only two sci-fi movies I enjoyed this year.

It is not.This movie is Loud, sometimes you cannot hear dialog, I don't mean volume, I mean sonic trash. The Camera shake is a crutch that attempts to hide Visual Effects that were clearly rushed, and not shot properly.The footage is under-lit during far too many scenes. At one point I saw the evidence of a Stage Hand in one of the shots, I'm sure the visual effects artists were not given a fighting chance to salvage what they had to work with.It is bad taste to say this movie rides on the coattails of other Iconic Science Fiction movies of the past. Dennis Quaid is one of my favorite guys, Ben Foster has done some great roles, the actors did well to bring the story to the screen.

The only criticism I have about the movie itself is the way in which the final plot twist regarding Lt.Payton's character was handled.

The remainder of the film parallels the experiences of the two men as they separate and seek to establish control over the ship.The film has a well-defined plot (not a given in modern sci-fi films) and sticks to it. No wacky subplots that peter out irresolutely; no absurd romancing. Also, mercifully absent were explanations of the current state of affairs that dragged the whole movie sideways.The finale is corny but satisfying.

The start is intense and allows the audience to fully feel the force of confusion from the main characters. However, as the story progresses, a lot of the intense scary, action scenes loose their edge as everything is edited together so quickly. It makes it disorientating, but too so for the audience to realise what has just happened. The special effects and setting of the movie are amazingly done, as are the costumes and lighting of the scenes. Although the film has an intriguing plot, it is quite hard to follow the characters' actions throughout as the audio from some of the characters is sometimes very hard to make out.

He meets a guy named Payton who's also a part of the crew and apparently has some knowledge of what's going on. The ship is adrift in space apparently. Bower is set out to go and fix it. Then the horror begins. I can't stress enough how important Alien was for it's time and the beginning of sci-fi horror. Well this is its 21 century version. I loved most of the scenes in this movie. I thought it was pretty well explained as to what had happened on the ship and back home, on Earth. The characters are OK, I mean as far as characters in a sci-fi horror movie genre can go.

Pandorum is inspired by other science fiction films, it does not justify harsh criticism, several films do this today. The plot is not the most original, but the film tries to delve into science as much as possible.The film has a good cast for this type of films, even if some characters are neutral, others stand out, as they fall headlong into the role of the character, this is impressive when we watch it, especially for a film of this size. The characters work well through the performance of the actors, some with exaggerations, but it is not a sin.The film leaves you claustrophobic to the point of being restless in your home chair, it goes at a fast pace with doses of tension leaving the audience entertained in various ways, in addition to living up to the visuals of fiction, the creatures and the intergalactic gloom, imagination is awakened in the public through these shadows, which could have been more used.In short we can say yes, it is a sci-fi horror film, but it does not carry the status that other classic sci-fi horror films do, but in any case, it is also worth watching Pandorum, due to the psychological sensation of seeing people in the space for so long surviving amid the gloom that the intergalactic carries.

And why does Dennis Quaid just sit at the controls through almost the entire movie, instead of joining Ben Foster, looking for him down in the depths of hell it seems like? Anyway, I really loved Ben Foster in this movie. He seemed perfectly cast for this physically challenging role he portrayed. But most of the other characters seem to be miss-cast. Very unorganized movie. Good Special Effects, however. This movie slightly resembles Alien in many scenes, including much of the story-line. I was really excited before I viewed this movie today. However, it was much less than I expected. But thanks to Ben Foster, he seemed to carry much of the movie himself. I am also surprised, that Dennis Quaid, one of my favorite actors, took this role.

You're in outer space, there has to be aliens, not blood thirst creatures.Frankly, I'm not recommending this movie to you. Go ahead and watch Event Horizon if you haven't. If you did watch Event Horizon, go for Alien series. This list can go up to sky, but the bottom movie is obvious-pandorum!",Pandorum

Don't know why it didn't do better at box office, as it seems like alien for the 2010s. I liked how you figure out what is going on with the characters as their memory returns. and that it is not clear whats real and what is psychotic visions. I had dreams thinking about this film as the essential premise is true...we will have to find another planet since we are using this one up. Ben Fosters character brings a welcome touch point of sanity, a good plot tool to engage the viewer. Very suspenseful!Great special effects and well done as part of the plot not extraneous. Id love to see the second of the trilogy!",Pandorum
270,StrontiumAE,Inside Pandorum's Box is a damn good film.,8,25 February 2010,"As sci-fi movies go, Pandorum is one of the more original you will find. Despite taking more than a few cues from the Alien franchise, this art house feature delivers so much freshness and punch (much like District 9); it can restore even the more cynical person's faith in Hollywood. Pandorum is at its core a psychological horror that is as much about the 'demons' that lay around a dark corner, as it is about the ones that haunt the mind. Staring Dennis Quad and Ben Foster as two surviving members of a crew who awaken from a deep sleep on board a city sized space ship, the pair has no recollection of how they ended up where they are, and what their mission is meant to be. Initially believing that the rest of the crew and the ship's large compliment of passengers are still asleep, it soon becomes apparent that something else is awake, and that this thing has a taste for human flesh. However, to reveal more about the plot will ruin the multiple twists that swiftly come one after another, right up until the end credits. Fans of Solaris, 2001 and Sunshine, who also do not mind copious amounts of blood and guts on screen, reminiscent of the horror thriller Descent, will enjoy this story. Although Michl Britsch music score proved distracting to the point of annoyance and the special effects are a little weaker than one would expect for a film released in 2010, everything else about Pandorum makes this a must see movie. The performances are excellent; the set designs are as epic as the story itself, and the direction is tight. 8 out of 10.",Pandorum

272,random343343,Awesome movie,9,8 October 2010,"I did not have high expectations walking into this but 5 minutes in and I was blown away. The movie does not give much away at the start and it is very clever how they build the plot up. I am a big fan of sci-fi movies. I liked all the alien movies except for 3. I also liked the recent revival of a Star Trek movie. Pandorum reminds me more of a video game I once played named dead space but with a much deeper and more compelling plot.In my opinion this is more an action film than a horror film. It makes you jump from time to time but if you have seen a few horror movies here and there than this will not really frighten you.Character development is great. All the characters feel like real believable characters and they all play their parts very well. There is some great twist here and they're that I honestly did not see coming. My only disappointment was that it was all over too quickly. I like a long movie like lord of the rings (extended edition) but it was still a decent length coming in at 108min. all up if you like a good action film mixed in with a small bit of horror than I would definitely recommend this, even if you're not into that I would still recommend this. 9/10 (10 perfect, 5 not really worth my time, 1 I would rather watch grass grow for 10 hours than watch this movie for 10 minutes).",Pandorum
273,DSP919,More Original than Derivative,6,6 April 2010,"I have a mixed opinion about this movie. On the one hand, in many respects it is not that original. It channels numerous sci fi/horror movies of the recent past, including the entire ""Alien"" series,2001, Star Trek, The Box, Terminator Salvation, the Descent,Deep Blue Sea, The Devil's Tomb, and even Shutter Island to name a few. Ben Foster spends almost the whole movie trying to ""reboot"" the reactor since the entire spaceship is dark. The final sequence in which the reactor blows up destroying all the monsters, and the whole concept of hyper-sleep was done before in Aliens and 2001. On the other hand, it has numerous qualities that make it somewhat unique and unquestionably exciting,or horrific: Dennis Quaid brings star power to a role that is probably less interesting than Star Trek's Captain Kirk; the humanoid white-faced mutant monsters with spines coming out of their backs could be viewed as a bit of an change from the Aliens, which have grown tiresome after at least 3 unnecessary sequels. The ejection of the 1000 capsules in the movie's last scene, the destruction of the spacecraft by water and the near-drowning of the two surviving protagonists (the cameraman uses a red filter) were exceptionally creative and an exciting climax. The captain's alter-ego, which shows him as a young man and separate both in mind and body from the captain, is interesting. The alter-ego pleads with the captain to abandon the mission as hopeless and tries to eject himself into the void, as in a previous ill-fated mission. The mental disease Pandorum that afflicts space travelers during claustrophobic space flight was original. The crew's near total amnesia was frightening. The Noah's Ark tube room and Ben Foster's eating of a live grasshopper are horrific. The overall darkness of the movie adds to the terror and is very reminiscent of another dark movie, Terminator Salvation. The fights between the Vietnamese soldier and the monster are exciting, as is his final confrontation with the child monster, who turns out to be armed with a deadly weapon. The artwork scratched into the walls, and the brief flashbacks to the voyage's beginnings give necessary background. It is noteworthy perhaps that gunfire is avoided in these enclosed spaces. The new planet, in contrast, is beautiful. But the miles of conduit pipe and see-through metal scaffolding, the recluse who for years has resorted to cannibalism to survive while forced to avoid the monsters is somewhat reminiscent of the ""Newt"" character in Aliens--all of these are quite derivative of James Cameron's terrific 1986 movie and its sequels. These derivative features and Quaid's occasionally uninspired performance give Pandorum at times a ""B"" movie feel which is perhaps not justified by its $40M price tag. The writing and the final revelation about the voyage's actual duration are exciting, and in particular the final scene, while a bit overdone or clichéd,is a logical conclusion.",Pandorum
274,cdanielabr,Overrated,3,10 January 2017,"I'm tired of watching the same plot over and over on this kind of movies, I just don't understand why can't we have good sci-fi movies anymore.Acting is mostly OK, but the characters are so void and stereotyped. Technically is also well done, but we all have seen these scenarios many times before. Everything is highly predictable.

275,Nexus_VI,It Starts Out Strong--Then Ends Weak,3,20 February 2010,"In the beginning, Pandorum has a lot going for it: slick set design; interesting characters and an air of mystery. Unfortunately, it's when the main antagonists--the creatures--are revealed that it all unravels. They look extremely fake and move even less real, with a herky-jerky motion that looks all the world as if the filmmaker just sped up the ""film"" (or digital sequence), like an old Keystone Cops movie or the end of a Benny Hill episode. They don't have anything more sophisticated than that for showing something moving rapidly? It was laughably bad, and if you're trying to scare people, you don't want your monster to make them laugh. Then, as if cued by the bad make-up and effects, the story began to spiral downward, with ho-hum action scenes (the monsters know Kung-fu weapons fighting, how about that?) and unbelievable explanations of how the monsters came about that just leave you rolling your eyes. It just became, for want of a better word, stupid. It could have done a lot with the interesting premise--including showing how the creatures come about--but instead they're just cookie cutter monsters with bad make-up, borrowed from 100 other alien/zombie movies.

As mentioned before we have the monsters from The Descent, we have some ""atmosphere"" and ""horror"" from Event Horizon (the only good film by Anderson, even if it was ruined by heavy editing by brainless execs) and we have the ending ripped off from Sphere, sort of. Well, Mr. Anderson, the fan-boys have seen all of these movies and more. You don't seriously think, you can steal your way out of it this cheap, don't you?And would somebody please delete the time warp effect from all Avid-Editing Suites around the world - we are really fed up with your stupid zombies and monsters moving around like in ancient silent movies.

278,somewhereovertheturnip,"Great, but by no means perfect.",7,16 November 2009,"Reviews have been overly negative, so I went into it with slightly shallow expectations (even though the trailer did pique my interest).However, I was very pleasantly surprised by one of the coolest Sci-Fi films I've seen in a very long time.From the off I was absolutely drawn into the plight of the two men trying to fight off paranoia, claustrophobia, panic, etc... while the desperation of their situation bore down on them. The set pieces were exceptionally well done, and the first section of the film is hugely atmospheric and tense. Going any further is going to require spoilers. All I can say is please, if you haven't heard anything about this film yet, DON'T go looking for more info. Stay away from the IMDb boards especially. While you could enjoy this even if the plot was spoilt for you, it'll be much more effective if you let it unravel with no further knowledge.The film covers every base for me in terms of what a decent sci-fi experience should: memorable characters and set-pieces, a plot that develops and twists (mostly) naturally,, a great transition from perceived situation to reality, and it doesn't ever feel dumbed down or the future science forced or unbelievable. The only flaws I can mention without spoiling are: -Some parts of whispered dialogue are annoyingly low -Some of the editing is a little confusing at times. -Some of the action moments are a little over the top (I'd have preferred more tension and less hands on, but it's not a film breaker and it's still fun to watch) -The way the back story is explained isn't absolutely efficient, and if you're not paying attention 100%, you could miss out on a couple of key elements and be left a little confused as to what exactly happened.I'd highly recommend this to fans of sci-fi such as Aliens, and Event Horizon, and while this film will no doubt be compared ad nauseum to the aforementioned, and while it doesn't' ever re-invent the reactor core, it DOES add up to more than the sum of its parts.A well crafted and hugely enjoyable experience, but not without its flaws.

What I loved the most about the movie is that it doesn't give you all the answers, it let's you imagine and figure them out. The other thing that I loved is the claustrophobic ambiance and disturbing scenes folding one after the other. Just amazing. The only thing that I didn't like so much was Dennis Quaid performance, don't misunderstand me, he's a terrific actor, I just think he can do better than that. I'm giving a 9 stars to this movie.

Seriously, I think that there's a lot more creative ideas out there that justify production than this film.Either it's the illogical outcomes or the means to get there that disappoint, but in the end it's all the same plots rehashed over and over again. We get it, we go out into space and maybe meet some hostile aliens, or something bizarre happens. But how about something unpredictable for once, like something perhaps that is on par with movies from the 70's and dare I say 80's as well.I think Hollywood has officially run out of ideas if this movie made it to production, and let alone had what are seemingly recognizable actors. The fact that movies like this are still being made and receive 7/10 ratings on IMDb is saddening and disappointing.I for one would love to just see a new plot for once. I have had better dream/nightmares with more coherent and original plots than Hollywood seems capable of producing with multimillion dollar budgets.Seriously, how is such inane screenplay writing possible on that kind of budget?

And it keeps your attention. There are some downfalls to this movie, for horror buffs the creatures are kinda comical, but to love this movie you have to look past that and just watch the storyline. The second bad thing about this movie, it was too short. I was so entertained I wanted it to be longer. Time zips by. There's a scene towards the end that you will find yourself grasping for air.

282,Awesomephant,Pandorum - One of my favourite movies,10,24 October 2011,"This movie just did it for me. I think it worked wonderfully and was able to deliver in all fields it explored - sci-fi, action, survival, horror. 10/10 from my behalf. Excellent action, excellent acting, excellent mood, excellent story, excellent ""bad-guys"" and excellent setting.The start quickly picks up your attention and curiosity - Ben Foster does a great work as a clueless man who just wakes up from prolonged sleep and Dennis Quaid, as usual, delivers a solid performance. The characters then have to discover what happened to the spaceship (as it seems abandoned), what happened to the crew, who the bad guys are, etc., leading them to discover new characters, fight off bad-guys, work together for common goals and learn about the events that preceded their awakening. The ending is excellent as well, involving a very cool surprise.The scenery was very enthralling, with the dark, mysterious corridors pumping up the adrenaline levels over and over again, especially since the characters are not exactly sure where they are (deep space?) nor what the exact date is - and find themselves in a confined location with dangerous creeps roaming around.The ""bad-guys"" were very well done. I'm glad they went with real actors and hours of make up to create these fantastic, lethal creatures instead of using computer animated beasts, which would probably tone down the level of the movie overall.If you prepare yourself to be immersed in Pandorum's universe (and obviously are a fan of this type), you will very likely enjoy this movie.",Pandorum

The people who are parroting ""oh, it's just over used scifi plot devices and blah blah blah"", don't have any idea what they're talking about.Films can be genre films. They don't have to re-invent the wheel. You can make a scifi/horror film and it can deal with issues that people deal with in scifi. I'd love to hear these critics share their thoughts on the original Indiana Jones films. ""Oh it's just over used action movie plot devices, like fighting Nazis? Please, haven't we seen that before?"" You can literally do that with any genre film, it's just critics choose to suckle up to the indie darlings or the movies that have Will Smith in them because they want to get their glorious kiss up words on the box and will pish posh dismiss anything they don't think will get them cool points with generation suck.So it's a scifi horror film that deals with memory loss, mutants, and the end of the world, what's wrong with that? It seems to me that films should be judged on what they are supposed to do, especially if it's a genre film. I'm not saying in the broad spectrum of, ""But is it art?"" and ""You can read my film from many directions, there is no specific way to read it"" kind of art house, janus pictures, black and white, 348 minutes of french tedium, but I'm saying that if a movie is supposed to be a comedy and you have a theater full of people laughing, that film is a success, that film did what it was supposed to do, maybe you didn't care for it's particular brand of humor, but you can't say that it was a bad movie. This is the case for ""The Master of Disguise"" a film that was a box office bomb and critically reviled, yet, has gone on to do quite well in the rental and home video market, because, it's a movie made for kids and kids love it. Same goes for the last bunch of unwatchable Steve Martin ridiculousness. If you're under the age of 12, chances are, you're going to love it, because it was made for you, it wasn't made for snarky 28 year old hipsters. So while I can't imagine ever wanting to watch The Pink Panther 2, I won't call it a bad film because it's not made for me and who it was made for, love it wholeheartedly.So in this genre film, of scifi horror, the audience I was with, myself included, were terrified throughout the picture. People jumping and screaming and laughing afterwards about how scared they were. Back to the film. It's a roaring success. The sets are gorgeous and the special effects are fantastic. The film moves quickly and is full of twists and terrifying jump outs. It's just a lot of fun to watch. It's fun to get scared.The film doesn't go overboard on the gore, it doesn't try to force in sex, it does feature good actors giving great performances. The CGI doesn't look awful like in 90% of the big effects driven films of today. The fear is real and the story, while having its roots firmly planted in some of the well worn treads of other scifi works has enough new and good ideas to make the picture seem fresh.Don't listen to the jerks, the critics and the haters.

After films like Moon, Alien and Pitch Black, my expectations were probably too high. It did have an Alien film feel about it. The story line was OK but the film lacked originality and coherence, and the mutants were old zombie type images seen in many other films. It seemed to lose the plot in the middle and some of the dialogue was confusing. Too many of the scenes were done in darkness making watching sometimes a strain on the eyes. Most of the time I did not get the sense that we were in a spaceship, even one as large as city. It was not until the end, which was the best part of the film, that all was revealed.As in many SciFi films, 20th century technology was used on the spaceship when it was supposed to be in the 22nd century. Lighted keyboards on computer controls are unlikely to exist in the next century. And there is unlikely to be conventional nuclear reactors. By that time alternative power sources will exist.

296,samanosuke19,SciFi fans will enjoy,7,26 September 2009,"Pandorum didn't blow me away with its originality but was certainly very entertaining to watch. It reminded me of three other movies I've seen and enjoyed. Alien, Serenity, and The Descent. The beginning of the movie was very captivating with its tense sequences of confusion and of the realization that something else was on board the ship. Many of the scenes reminded me of Alien and The Descent. The claustrophobia feel, crawling through the air ducks, and the eerie feeling knowing that your not alone.What I feel lacked in the film was the attempted ""twist"" at the end. Only TV shows can build that type of suspense that creates an effective twist because you've grown with the characters over an entire season and the longer run time allows for a more elaborate story. A film doesn't have that luxury and many times ends up rushing things. If the twist isn't going to be a jaw dropping revelation then don't put too much emphasis on it. Accept what the movie is and embrace it.Personally I wish they had kept the movie more a thriller and only revealed the creatures in the end. The story could have been more interesting if it had been told in bits and pieces. Each crew member only remembered certain details, and as more survivors were found all the memories were being put together in one cohesive thought, like a jigsaw puzzle.Overall it was enjoyable. I was kept on edge most of the movie. The suspense was good, the action was average, had your token hottie, gruesome deaths, overall your typical SciFi movie.",Pandorum
297,origo13,Space Zombie film with a story to tell...a damn good one.,8,23 January 2011,"This is definitely one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen. The trickiest part of any futuristic Sci-Fi is to create an environment that looks and feels believable as dictated by the background setting. Pandorum succeeded in this with flying colors. The film sets really convinced me that the space-ship is indeed from the year 2174 all thanks to the amount of detail and quality of the film sets, no cheap 'Farscape' space decks here.The story was unique and kept me captivated throughout its duration unlike 90% of other films.

Granted, the story-telling is patchy in places and the horror part seems like it would've been better cut out, but the whole thing is fairly enjoyable. It could've done with a bigger budget, wider scope and focus on character instead of physical mutations. Pandorum is a fairly good horror movie, but you can certainly find better horrors out there. What makes it better is a well-designed core plot and good/great execution with solid acting. Certainly worth the 1.5 hours.",Pandorum

The annoying thing is I can't place what annoyed me more, the performances, or the direction, or even the complete lack of pace. Having not seen anything else from this director, I'm not inclined to search anything out, there will be an audience out there for this crap, hell the score on here proves that, but I can't think of anyone I personally know who will find this entertaining or interesting.On the plus side it did cure my insomnia.",Pandorum

However, after hearing a few positive reviews of it, I decided to give Pandorum a shot. I found that this is a perfect film for any sci-fi/thriller fan, and it's certainly worth seeing. Any film that focuses on only a few characters is always risky because if the actors aren't fit for the role, the film will lose its captivation to the audience. Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid did well enough in this film to make their tumultuous emotions felt by the audience. One thing I liked particularly about this film was the explanation of what happened to the crew. This film kept my interest because the entire time I was trying to figure out why things were so screwed up on the ship, but the film's explanation was different, and pretty cool. Anyone who doesn't mind being scarred or uncomfortable during a film will certainly enjoy Pandorum.",Pandorum

It starts of relatively predictably but adequately enough. The acting and visual presentation are very good and immerse you into the atmosphere. As the film progresses several very interesting plot twists and evolutions occur. I think this movie taps into a lot of key primal fears and concepts without ever being anything but a very entertaining movie.I thought all the actors did particularly well and it was an excellent movie casting Dennis Quaid.

GREAT ATMOSPHERE, the kind that is perfect for the scifi genre. just perfect! from the high-tech impossibly man-made spaceship to holographic projection technology to the wretched mutants. solid acting, great feel, esp. the hot German chick, whoohh. breathtaking! i gotta say the most astonishing and enlightening scene in the movie is the one where deep sea creatures were shown swimming outside of the ship, it immediately injects an eerie sense of thrill and wonder. excellent twist concerning that all this time, humanity could have been restarted and yet it's humanity themselves that hindered their own iniation by internally destroying each other. what a theme! humanity are self-destructive and clueless even with all the commodities they created around to benefit them. after all the calamity on the ship, the ending couldn't be more perfect and enlightening as hope surges and survival ensured in a BEAUTIFUL tanis scenery that has never been more liberating and SWEET, and guess what, they have 1200s other human survivors to share it with! now let me ask you this, have you ever felt such high and relief ever seeing those pods popping up one by one even in limited number? has the number 1200s meant more to you than ever? once u begin the fathom how precious and significant this minute yet grand population is, u will get to realize the true value of human life?

I was so shocked at its greatness that i actually had to watch it again and again.Not only did this movie have unexpected greatness included but it also had an unexpected story line and ending. I mean the ending scene with the pods emerging from the water and also who better to play the bad guy(s) other than Cam gigandet and Dennis Quad, it was amazing. And if you haven't seen any Cam Gigandet films you'd better do that before the next one. My only criticism is that it didn't have a better soundtrack and a better suited actress to play the girl (no offense).

It's up to you to decide .... well i loved it better than any science fiction ever, just because of the starting and ending it's the ultimate truth, if we ever lived to see the day or our race live to see it.Acting , production , and technique was well set and satisfying it griped me for as long as the movie continued, before long it ended and felt like it was only some few minutes ago and believe it that i mean-it... may be i was at the right mood for the movie but rest of what you think is up to you.",Pandorum

This film is one of the most terrifying action/horror/sci-fi movies I have seen in a very long time, but that's not the best part! The best part is the intriguing story with some amazing twists! Some are obvious and at least one is just completely unexpected, but none of them feel overly typical. Ben Foster is really really good in this and I must say that he is getting much better at picking roles, with 3:10 to Yuma and now this! One thing that really stuck out to me also, was how much some of it reminded me of the game Dead Space, don't read into that too much as far as story goes, it's just that there are a few elements that I think were inspired by the game, and if you have played Dead Space, I think you will know what I mean when you see it.

I could mention every scene vis-a-vis to the originals which I kind of made a game of throughout the movie.Ben Foster's typically insane expressions and teenage angst acting added more lunacy to what seems to be this movie's central theme. The close up shots of his maniacal facial expressions coupled with some crazy camera work were a bit over used and over the the top at times. Monsters, Kung Fu, Space sickness...its a mess of a plot that doesn't make sense. At best this is just another popcorn movie.Definitely not joining the sci-fi greats.

316,ninfanwill,A great addition to the sci-fi genre.,7,13 January 2010,"I have been waiting to see this one for too long now and finally got to see it last night. It was worth the wait though because this was a great addition to the sci-fi genre. I've heard comparisons to Aliens and I guess I can see why, but then again when you set a movie in space and have some sort of creature involved you're instantly granted the Aliens comparison. By the end of this flick it certainly makes a name for itself and stands on it's own. It was a head trip of a movie that left me wondering who was crazy or if I was the one who was crazy! Ben Foster as Bower is the first to wake up followed by Dennis Quaid as Payton. They're vaguely aware of where they are and what they're doing but it's still pretty fuzzy. They begin thinking that they're the only ones left alive on the ship but soon realize that not only are there other survivors, there's also some very strange human looking creatures that are out for blood. Pieces of the story are slowly revealed as the characters remember more about what's going on and you start to get the bigger picture. We also learn about pandorum which is a form of insanity brought on by hyper sleep. It's here where the movie starts to mess with your head. You start wondering who may have pandorum, or maybe everyone has it, or maybe you have it! It's a great twist to the movie as it threw me off balance in what to expect. Unfortunately it becomes clear who has what too soon and took away a little from the ending.Speaking of the ending, the big reveal at the end was satisfying. I personally didn't see it coming but I was so involved in the movie that I hadn't even been thinking about it. This made it a surprise for me but it may be too easy for others to figure out. While the plot may not drop any great twists onto the general viewing public, the performances of all the characters are strong enough to carry this one. I like a good spaceship flick and this one doesn't disappoint. The creatures in the flick look great as well and while they are a definite threat, it still felt as if they were only a nuisance in the grand scheme of things. I don't think the movie would have suffered one bit if you had taken them out as there's enough human characters ready to backstab each other that the tension would still be there. The creatures only end up adding to this tension which isn't a bad thing.You're confronted on every side by questions this way. Obviously you can't trust bloodthirsty monsters but some of the remaining survivors don't seem to be a much better option. While this may not be the most original movie out there, I still recommend it. Sure we've all seen the creature on the space ship flicks and I'm sure that lots of you will see the ending coming miles away but with strong acting and a great look and feel to the movie you'd be missing something if you didn't add this to your collection.",Pandorum
317,jpbrumby,An assured 21st century collage of sci-fi horrors,8,20 September 2011,"'In space no one can hear you scream' intoned the Alien tagline way back in 1979, like some kind of spaceman rapist with Bad Ideas. Pandorum is more a case of 'In spaceship, savage spear-wielding freaks can hear you scream. So don't.'Pandorum is a solid sci-fi with a tight 108 minute runtime, starting with a first-half rehash of clueless protagonists realising that they are not on holiday in Hawaii and wait, what was that sou -- 'OH SH** WHAT THE F***, SHOOT THE LITTLE B******S!'. The well-worn premise is invigorated by assured performances from Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster as LT. Payton and Corporal Bower respectively, who are in turn helped by an unobtrusive script that is several light years ahead of Michael Bay back on Earth, with his borderline mentally-retarded fireball obsession.'Alien' marks an early influence in the genesis of Pandorum, and Ripley's ghost hovers over the film as little space engineers and scientists scuttle through the dim corridors and engine guts of the mysterious spaceship Elysium. The film can be read as a successful synthesis of its influences, from the Cube start-point of confused protagonists waking up in a strange environment to the Event Horizon island madness that threatens to derail Bower and Co.'s attempts to get Elysium up and running in the final third.And this huge spaceship, despite drifting in space, drives the plot forward at several points. Elysium is a citadel of hibernating people, launched from a predictably effed-up Earth with the sole intention of reaching Earth II (Tanis) so that the human race can continue to do the dirty and smoke post-coital cigs on the other side of the galaxy.As with the more recent, and inferior, Predators film which follows a similar sci-fi riff with similar all-round competence, the plot struggles to maintain momentum towards its conclusion. Plot points feel forced towards resolution within the small time-frame and, though twists are reliably well-handled by director Christian Alvart and crew, the actual twists are pretty well-established film devices.Pandorum is a strong sci-fi horror that goes some way to redressing the decade-long lobotomy that has been the Modern Blockbuster. Unfortunately the film bombed upon release back in 2009, cutting short talks of a trilogy. In its skillful direction, strong acting and intriguing CGI savages however, Pandorum as a stand-alone film is an example of what can be achieved with studio productions. If only other people would kindly watch this rather than encouraging the recent rashes of big, friendly robots and square-jawed superheroes.",Pandorum

Payton and Corp. Gallo comes out nice in the big secret payout. Granted it did seem abit obvious but the fluid motion to the finale was nice.Bottom Line: It was surprisingly something I went into just to get out of the house and was expecting a let down turns out to be a good flick. worth watching definitely, and i hope i am not alone on think this somehow could have been a survival horror video game. or at least this could have been the script for one.",Pandorum
319,crowcaster,"Disappointing, but entertaining",7,23 November 2009,"Based on the other comments on this movie and the IMDb rating, I expected Pandorum to be a pretty good sci-fi movie. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to those expectations.The story of Pandorum revolves about a long-distance spaceship designed for colonizing a distant planet. In order to survive the long trip, nearly all passengers are suspended in hyper-sleep. Needles to say, something goes wrong during the trip. Not wanting to spoil this movie for anybody, I don't want to divulge into further details about the story.Still, I think it's pretty safe to say that this movie heavily borrows from all-time favorites like Alien, Event Horizon and Pitch Black. And while the aforementioned movies succeed in creating a feeling of dread and suspense, Pandorum creates... nothing? In my opinion, the movie always seems to fail in the critical moments. Whenever you expect something scary to show up around the corner, you're suddenly transferred into a b-movie with cheesy special fx and ""surprising"" plot twists you could see coming from 20 miles away.Pandorum is entertaining. In the long run, it will probably end up being one of those movies that you'll watch for the umpteenth time just because there's nothing else worth watching on TV. Still, despite its entertainment value, it kind of disappoints. There's simply nothing special about it that incites me to recommend it.If you want to see an entertaining sci-fi popcorn movie, go ahead and watch Pandorum. It's a nice, action-oriented sci-fi flick with lots of eerie light sources (snaplights! :) ). But if you feel like watching something special, pick a different movie. Like Moon. Or Alien.

Any person who thinks that Pandorum has not shown new sides in this genre - is absolutely right! But if we look at any new film about a strange child (for example Alvart's ""Case № 39"" or ""Orphan"") we will see that these movies are just variations of the ""Omen"".

The acting was superb (I LOVE Foster & Quaid), the story was original & kept me riveted, & the ending blew me away - I never saw the end twist coming at all! That's a rare thing in most movies the last 15 years. I also loved the atmosphere - I felt like I was right there with ""Bower"" (played by Foster) all the way.

323,cole-reichenberg,Okay idea poor acting and bad writing,4,10 August 2014,"Her is my honest review of a movie I was excited to watch:I liked the plot. Perfect for a scifi mood.The acting and plot progression was too much for me to bare. Minor spoiler: in one scene a character tells another ""I need to get to the reactor, you stay here."" He then leaves almost died. The other character appears again from seemingly no where and now knows where the reactor can be located and tells him he will show him. How does this kind of plot error happen in a big budget movie. Dennis quads character is not worth anything in the movie. His lines are so basic it hurt to hear him talk. Why do writers allow any characters in a movie to have such little personality or flare? Gerard butler would have been a great choice if you ask me just because he does a great job with expressions to make his character exciting to watch.The good: impressive costumes, makeup, and gore scenes. This is where the movie shines. It has some really unnerving and disturbing moments of fright and terror. That being said, because we have no idea what the scary creatures are or that they are actually worse than being trapped at deep space travel forever, I lost interest in the very shallow characters' fate.That's all I have on the movie because I didn't see it going anywhere I cared to go along with it so I stopped watching. Because of that, this is not a full review but it speaks volumes about the movie's set up. I made it about 40 minutes in before turning it off and returning it.

324,Laura_Organa_Solo,"Regardless of its Predecessors, ""Pandorum"" Stands Just Fine on Its Own",9,22 January 2010,"It's impossible to watch the trailers for ""Pandorum"" and not immediately draw comparisons to its predecessors -- the ""Alien"" series, ""Event Horizon,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Solaris,"" etc. In spite of the easy comparisons, however, ""Pandorum"" not only manages to stand on its own two feet but takes things in an interesting new direction.Yes the basic premise -- people stuck in a large, dark, malfunctioning spaceship with something awful -- has been done before but ""Pandorum"" puts a new spin on things that keeps the story fresh and intriguing. The final twist is new and different, even if the characters aren't quite so (although Dennis Quaid was very good as the level-headed, unflappable captain trapped alone). The acting was solid.Something I enjoyed that I haven't seen in a horror movie in a long time is the less-is-more approach that the director took with the violence and gore for the bulk of the movie. I think it made things more sinister and mysterious and it kept me guessing at just how dire the situation was and how long it had been going on (is it just a few monsters? How monstrous are they, anyway? Are they completely feral or are they sentient? Have they been eking out a pathetic existence for a few years or for decades?).Don't pass ""Pandorum"" up just because you think you might have seen it before in the form of other movies.

Here they are:-Alien(s) - Event Horizon - The Descent - The Abyss - Doom - Masters of the Universe (especially ''Skeletor'')All-in-one: Don't mind this crappy review, just go and watch this awesome movie as soon as you can!!! 8/10",Pandorum
327,felekisz,Self-confident and uncompromised,9,28 October 2009,"What makes a thriller great ? A serious tone, tension and unpredictability. Pandorum has them all. It doesn't make a mockery of itself by employing jokes, sex or smartass heroes. And that is really rare nowadays. The script is intelligent and it contains a few surprises that culminate in a very satisfying ending. Don't let anyone ruin it for you. The music and the audio effects are especially effective, the pacing is near perfect and pretty much everything from acting to direction works beautifully. And guess what, the cinematography and editing aren't epilepsy-inducing. Woohoo !One could argue that the movie could have been better if it had a bigger budget. More detailed and varied sets wouldn't have hurt. But who cares when you're sucked in from minute one and kept interested (not to mention terrified) throughout the whole deal ?If you love sci-fi, psychological horror and movies that are just plain INTENSE, do yourself a favor and check out Pandorum. It's grittier than District 9 and much scarier than the Alien series. For me, this was a small revelation and the year's best movie-going experience. I hope the people involved in making this gem will get the recognition they deserve.",Pandorum
328,sdtsanev,"Beautifully shot, amazingly acted thrill",10,8 October 2009,"I didn't expect much from Pandorum when I went to see it. Therefore I was taken completely by surprise as to how incredibly good the movie was. It's very strange for me to love so much a strictly genre piece, but there you have it.Pandorum follows the rules of SF/horror deep-space stories and doesn't stray into new territory, but it still manages to not seem a rip-off of anything, even when you see clearly which movies it was inspired by in specific scenes.Pandorum is claustrophobic to the point of suffocation. It is darkly schizophrenic and vibrates with barely contained hysteria. It is also almost entirely devoid of cheap shocks, which is very much to its credit.The movie delivers an amazing performance from both leading characters, but especially from Ben Foster whose Corporal Bower is both strong and vulnerable, barely keeping it together. He is so believable in fact, that at some point I almost began to feel some of the hysterics of his situation.The camera is also great, especially in portraying the claustrophobic shaft sequences and the movement of the creatures infesting the ship Elysium. The way it focuses on characters' faces during specific moments also strengthens the atmosphere of panic and dementia.All in all, Pandorum is far more than I expected, and I loved every second of it. True, it presents nothing original and sticks to the basics of a very limited genre. But he does it masterfully, with superb acting and a scorchingly engaging atmosphere. For me that is not only the SF, but also the horror movie of the year.",Pandorum
329,Nikker1985,One of the best Sci-Fi fictions.,10,26 February 2013,"It seems that the so called ""nerds"" have become so passionate with certain franchises such as Star Trek or Star Wars, that they constantly talk about them, giving them exposure while overshadowing good Sci-Fi movies that unfortunately stay under the radars.Like Moon, Pandorum is one of these movies. Sure, I ve read lots of constructive criticism which does not, however explain how bad this movie performed. It was said that the movie used too many clichés or that the acting was bad. I simply disagree with both. If you are willing to eat a live cockroach for the sake of your movie, then you ve actually acted better than some Oscar Winners who cant even not act like themselves (Looking at you Jack).There were so many good memorable moments in that movie but most of all,the whole setting is amazing, the confusion this movie puts you through and the emotions...but above all, the story is simply amazing. I highly recommend it.",Pandorum
330,vejo,Swiss cheese,2,21 November 2009,"Interesting in the beginning, with lots of unanswered questions, if's and unfinished scenes, but..The link between the title and the film doesn't add up, the title refers to a space travel syndrome, but the syndrome plays only a small and rather insignificant part of the film, which turns to in to a never-ending story of huge holes in the plot. Nothing i this ""copy this and steal that"" can be justified as original, smart or elegant, it's just speculative moneymaking. Mad Max/thriller-like ""mutants"" so stupid and stereotype you hardly believe it takes up most of the ""space"" in a film with a ""lets make up stuff as we go along""-script made in a day. The film ends when a ! panorama-window in the front section of a ship meant to travel in empty space at high velocity breaks.. call NASA and complain. I hope somebody threatened Dennis Quaid to sign this role.. Would that somebody please find those responsible for this film and tell them to find something else to do?

333,jediknight-19,Pandorum is an Amazingly Original and Mesmerizing.,10,26 September 2009,"Pandorum is an amazingly original and crafty sci-fi/horror film. The premise is well thought out and the script delivers bang on from the opening scene to the end. This movie grabs you like a vice right from the start, and never releases until the final credits. The mise-en-scene is beautifully dark and realistic, against the juxtaposition of human beings waking up in a ship without memories of who they are or their mission. The audience explores with the two crew members unraveling the mystery. There are many twists in this film and it's hard to find words without spoilingso just go see ityou won't be disappointed.In my opinion, this is the best sci-fi/horror film to hit the major screens since Alien. I viewed Pandorum on Friday, and then Surrogates on Saturday, and without question, Pandorum is a superior film. Pandorum has it all, from dark scenes, fast moving monsters, isolationit's all there and more. In fact, I haven't felt this much realistic isolation and since Carpenter's 'The Thing'. Yes, I loved this movie! It's definitely one you want to see plastered on the big screen.",Pandorum

Besides The Road, I have not seen a better post apocalyptic film thus far. Pandorum is set on a space ship in the future where crew members awake with no recollection of their past, where or who they are. Pandorum contains excellent acting, excellent special FX (no bad CGI)and a script that will not reveal anything until the end. Ben Foster has let me down in the past with shoddy films (like Alpha Dog)but his acting is always top notch. Just as good as 3:10 To Yuma this is by far one of his best roles. This is one excellent film! It really kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the film. Highly Recommended 9 out of 10 stars!",Pandorum

337,dextux,Probably great for certain science fiction fans.,5,30 September 2010,"This movie felt a bit like it was written and directed by a 14 year old boy whose watched lots and lots of science fiction movies. There was plenty of stuff you expect in a science fiction movie: funny uniforms, suspended animation, aliens and stun guns, but not a lot in between. Pandorum really lacks depth and passion.At no moment did I feel that the director wanted to convey anything except how great his set was and how he'd really tried hard to make this all plausible. In other words, the movie doesn't really have anything to say, but also isn't in any way artistic or moving.In Pandorum's defense though, if you like science fiction movies simply because they involve spaceships and people traveling to other planets, and don't expect anything (and I mean anything) from a movie except entertainment (and find watching people being chased around spaceships by aliens entertaining), this movie is for you. On saying that though, Starship Troopers comes to mind, which I actually enjoyed. The difference between this movie and Starship Troopers is that the latter had a talented cast, was well directed and witty. And perhaps the fact that I was 14 years old when I watched it...",Pandorum
338,cooper101183,Absolutely Thrilling from start to finish..... A Pleasant Surprise,10,30 January 2010,The film itself is a sort of a SCI-FI/Mystery/Thriller. The plot revolves around two pilots who wake from stasis. The have no recollection of where they are who they are or what there mission is.This opening sequence sets the scene for the whole movie. The director does a fantastic job of moving the audience along with the characters which results in both being on a journey of discovery and both are no doubt formulating there own theories. This is very refreshing as the audience do not have any other insight than the crew themselves. For a low budget movie the effects are spectacular the acting is excellent and the ending of the story is extremely satisfying. I could draw similarities between this and I am legend however I firmly believe this to be the better film. Watch this film you will not be disappointed.,Pandorum
339,matwashere,A Surprising Sci-Fi/Thriller.,9,11 August 2010,"I was very surprised by this movie. I didn't hear much about it until a friend of mine suggested I watch it. The plot in this was amazing and the acting was well done. The idea was something I haven't seen before, but was an awesome idea and they followed with it well. The only reason I gave this a 9/10 was because there was a plot hole or two in the movie that I realized they never assessed. From what I'm to understand, Dennis Quaid was the person trying to play God. Did he wake up and act like that and go back to hyper sleep or did he act like a God from when he was younger? Although there were moments like this, it leaves it up to the imagination some which makes it an even more fun movie to enjoy. I wouldn't suggest this for everyone, though; if you love sci-fi horror movies, this is a must-see.---EDIT--- I just watched it again and now I understand the God part haha. Makes much more sense now.",Pandorum
340,bjdomeij,**Spoilers** Thoughts about the movie **Spoilers**,7,25 November 2009,"First I'd like to express my overall opinion about the movie. It's well worth a watch, both if you like sci-fi and horror, and specially if you like sci-fi horror. I think it did well in both genres. Also the acting was pretty good.Though some things distracted me... (I might have missed some dialogue. It was a lot of whispering and I had no subtitles.)First, the ship is full of maneating mutants. Usually you'd say that a common threat unites people. Then why would that girl agressivly attack him? Because she wanted his boots? I mean come on... That cliché I-trust- no one attitude just felt stupid.And oh, why would that first encountered mutant just drag him away and leave him? If the mutant was saving him for later or something, why not wound him, tie him up, or lock him in? That really made no sense to me. First he gets dragged away, then they cut the scene, in the next moment he's hiding in some room and there's no sign of the mutant.And about these mutants. Way too exaggerated for my taste. Their spikey armors, their superstrength, their wallclimbing, their ridiculous chest-first superleaps, their weapons, their lack of speech. One mutant even got hit by a machete deep into his scull, whereupon he just rips it out and keeps fighting like nothing. And yet, despite these awesome abilities, they seem to spend a lot more time screaming, and pushing away the prey than actually killing it.Also I felt the plot rather confusing. (Again, this may be because I had no subtitles and there were a lot of whispering.)Others than that I felt the movie was pretty awesome. The ending was nicely done. First they confused you by saying, ""Look, there are no stars!"" And your mind started trying to work out what the h*ll was going on. I really felt like ""whaaat?"". For a second I thought they'd actually hit the end of universe and was travelling in the emptiness haha. I didn't expect that ending at all.",Pandorum
341,alissawatkins,Brilliant,9,26 October 2009,"Great movie and I generally don't even like ""Sci Fi"" movies. There was definitely a creep element to this movie and psychological undertones.

I don't want to give it away! See it. It's worth it and it will make you think at the end. I definitely pondered the meaning of life and our existence when I walked out of that theater.

A different ending (which I won't spoil) sets the stage for a possible sequel, but I haven't read anything is planned.A game version iPhone app was released with the theatrical release of the movie but now there is a new free iPhone app that is super fun.

There is genuine suspense, edgy editing,action scenes and eccentric characters to keep it visually interesting and a clever little plot twist at the end to keep the brain box thinking.Well worth a viewing.",Pandorum

This movie is different. You can trust the main character, he is believable, smart, and you'd probably act the same way.It'll happen with this movie the same happened with ""the Matrix"" .

345,humbledebase,"Pandorum - Bad breast, OK film.",6,23 February 2010,"Let's not get too excited. It isn't Aliens (alien-lovers) and grievously it isn't quite as disturbing (therefore entertaining) as Event Horizon; both of which are very imaginatively scary. This film gives too much. And because it gives us too much we, 9 times out of 10, prudently assume how the whole story is going to pan out. I am now going to say ""It is entertaining, though"". If I was chatting with Michael Crawford I would say ""watch it"", but if I was conversing with Pinter I would say ""do not watch this"".The story isn't terrible, but it does cash in on this very slow climate altering Armageddon we are currently experiencing. Why am I so miserable? I don't particularly like films that are pertinent to current events. This is not only because they have less chance of being timeless and have narrowed their story-telling scope, but they also make an attempt on my Stirling by twisting actual serious concerns (like climate change and the grey squirrel crisis). Thus consequently shaping the opinion of the less-enabled public to what is actually happening now and what is going to happen in the future. But woe there! This film isn't supposed to go that deep (although I'm sure the direct patrons of this film are deep in a very sinister looking way).What happened to the old days where earth just exploded and one ship got away, and we left blank as to why. Here it is - Earth dies, the watcher presumes why. It is a little sad that it has to excite us with notions of 'death by climate change'. The oil is going to run out first, and civilisation is most probably going to rhythmically churn down to a very slow obese grind. Services will go first. But woe there! Anyway, I would say watch it. For me it reminisced of Aliens and Event Horizon, and space is just generally pretty cool anyway. Plus it allows for a little grumble afterwards expressing that it's not ""better than blah blahbut its OK"". The special effects aren't bad (although weirdly similar to Disturbia by Rhinna!!!). I would have probably said they were rather good if I hadn't seen Avatar a week beforehand (level up!). Furthermore, the acting isn't that bad (as good as it is ever going to be for being in the situation they are in) and the film/characters do genuinely offer a sense of hopeless dread. Although I warn you thus, there is a cheap pair of Lara Croft breasts in the film, which suddenly makes the whole hopeless dread experience a little more  well, cheap and light-hearted.

This movie was exciting, thrilling, terrifying, and jaw-dropping all at once. The beginning starts a bit slow, I noted to myself 30mins into the film that the plot was really just unfolding - however, with such a complex storyline, it's no wonder there was a lot of explaining to do. Anyway, the movie's choices in actors were also quite good - I especially loved Nadia's character (I always love a good kick-ass female in movies). Overall, the movie was really action-packed and exciting, however, there were some things I would recommend to viewers:Be sure you're watching on a television with GOOD sound quality - some scenes are filmed in rather unforgiving acoustics.Be prepared to pay attention throughout the whole movie - (without spoiling) - I had a lot of trouble figuring out what had happened with their communications with Earth and what EXACTLY the creatures were since I failed to pay attention at the beginning.Be prepared to have remaining questions about what will happen and how this all happened - they definitely should do a sequel <3...however, if you read into the budget stuff, as Holylwood must, it's a definite no for now :(Loved this movie, definitely see it if you haven't!",Pandorum

Don't listen to critics and haters, because this movie, as a Sci-Fi/horror film, is better than a lot of others out there. Some of the movies out there in this genre are garbage, but Pandorum is not. If you like space movies with some scary to it, then this movie is for you. It's so good that not having a sequel is very, very, very saddening that I will probably never see a sequel. It just goes to show that the creativeness in this movie is being over looked for some reason, like so many other awesome flicks. Go to Facebook 500,000 to get Pandorum sequel. The plot is so different but great and mind boggling that I kept thinking about it for days after I watched it, and that's how you know it's a really good movie. I just had to watch it over and over.

Still while being a rip-off it could have been an enjoyable movie. Unfortunately it wasn't.Firstly, it is damn DARK through all the movie. You see just darkness, flashlights and emergency lamps through 90% of the time. There are some people, some mutants chasing and fighting each other but you just can't see anything. Where is the fun? Then, you don't care at all about these people. Will they survive, will they die, what's the difference? They have no personalities, you barely see their faces and see no emotions at all (darkness again!) And there is quite a lot of strangers on this spaceship so you can easily get lost and forget who is who.As a result it was just boring for me.

It's exciting, frenetic, and full of action. I like space-horror movies, and being an interested person in astronomy and space related topics, I found very interesting the possibility of finding an exoplanet similar to Earth, where life might be found someday.This movie covers this topic, in great extent. It's an interesting idea, because we -as humans-, expect to find some life-form in another planet, some day.But, I really want to say that, for some moments, I had trouble following up the story in the movie. Very fast scenes, sometimes incoherent lines... I must say that I felt lost in several moments, losing my interest in the movie, and then coming back again when things returned to ""normal"" action.I wouldn't watch it again, because although the story is very good, the movie is for THAT moments, boring and delusional.If you want action and fast scenes, you'll like it.

It doesn't once make you jump from your seat or make your heart beat faster.While I've found the ending to be unpredictable, the entire movie is just one long boring treck through the ship without anything to make you care about any of the people in it - the characters are so boring and the plot makes so few demands of them that you could replace them with video game models and it wouldn't make any difference. You keep watching hoping that something - something! - will happen to change this but no, it just goes on and on, identical shots and sequences on repeat until the end - such is the lack of imagination.As for the action sequences, these too are so poor that you'll find much better ones playing a video game, any video game that's gone out in the last few years has better action than this movie!

The mutants looked like something from mad max beyond thunderdome. Then there is the ending: pop up to the surface and ""sweet! we're here!"", well... the humans are going to have a hard time getting their supplies and specimens up from the ship with those mutants down there! How are they going to work that out? They should have spent more time on Quaid and who he was and the pandorum sickness, and made it more psychological than silly mutant humans.

357,Szczez,Good s-f mixed with average action/horror,9,25 November 2009,"Unexpectedly, 2009 appears to be a good year for s-f. After ""District 9"" and ""Moon"", ""Pandorum"" is the third movie I've seen that can be truly classified as hard science fiction - well, not very ambitious in all three cases, but a completely different animal than ""CGI galore with no internal logic"" usually served. In a perfect world, I'd give it a 6-7 for the weaker action/horror part and some flaws, but in a world that didn't provide real s-f since maybe 2006, and gives good reviews to something like the new ""Star Trek"", Pandorum gets a 9 - it means that you sadly won't see anything much better.The good: the plot and back story's exposition is quite good, with constant trickle of information, and it doesn't become completely obvious until the very end of the movie. It is complicated enough to keep your brain awake, but it all clears well up with no gaping holes. People calling it an Alien ripoff etc. show only their limited s-f scope. It's closer to some classical s-f themes of long space journey gone awry, like Brian Aldiss' ""Non-Stop""... Of course it is no epic, rather a decent short story.Pace is very good (to my taste), with slow and mysterious beginning and an intense ending. The action/horror part in the middle is dragging a bit, though. I found no big flaws in the film's logic, the back story that is partially told and partially implied is consistent and it explains basically everything we've seen. The monsters seem too weird even for the explanation provided in the middle of the movie, until we know how long they have really been on board. The fact that two people left alive have some martial arts skills is logical too (amidst 16000 people some had to know how to fight, and they were the only ones who could survive waking up). Even the end speech of the villain isn't just typical babble (as I saw it characterized in some reviews), it actually makes sense in connection with what happened to Earth and what he tried to do - to start anew with a different mankind, to achieve different results - there is a method to his craziness.Ben Foster as Bower is well cast and acts well. Of course, as the viewpoint character with no one to have deeper relation with, he is underexposed, but still the way he reacts to his situation is psychologically probable and portraits a real, if somewhat vague human being. Dennis Quaid acts less, but his role doesn't provide him with many chances to show skills, and what he does is OK.the lighting, sets etc. provide for a good hard s-f mood, it is not original but it works. I didn't mind the darkness, I either saw or knew what is going on all the time.The bad and could-have-been-better: Movie has only two characters (Bower and Payton), others are just decoration. The girl and the warrior farmer (Nadia and Manh) have basically the same function, and the only reason we have them both is because somebody had to die valiantly and the girl was supposed to survive with the main hero. It would be better from a writer's point of view to merge Manh with the cannibal (Leland), who serves no real purpose after joining the team. It would save some time in the middle, too. Also the girl acts tough in a somewhat annoying way.Shaky, cut up cinematography is mildly distracting, but that is a sign of times probably. As a redeeming feature, it is not used mindlessly - the scene after the surviving crew-member (Shepard) being caught and killed is particularly messy (inconsistent speed, chopped scenes), but it appeared to me as an effect of viewpoint character (Bower) being shocked. The level of ""shakiness"" seems to indicate Bower's psychological condition throughout the movie, or at least that's how I've seen it.Fight scenes are rather weak and at least one is too long.Horror part has no escalation. The s-f has a unraveling mystery, but the horror is basically level, with the monsters shown quite early on and nothing changing in their regard up to the end.The monsters are underexposed. They show some signs of technology use and of some warrior/macho culture. Showing them as generic monsters with no psychology or intelligence (apart from the two points above) wastes some opportunities. That might be a sequel space, on the other hand.Bower deserves some more explanation, too. In the end he certainly remembers something about Payton but we don't know what. We know something about his earth life, but not what he was doing on the ship, and he certainly was awake for some time during the journey. That is probably the prequel space the makers were talking about, though:). Overall, it is definitely worth seeing if you like s-f (not ""space fantasy"", not ""a series of CGI connected with a plot placeholder"", but s-f, like in ""s-f literature""). It might entertain you if you like horror, because it is different than most (being mainly an s-f movie). For mainstream viewers, probably not so good, as the mainstream reviews show.",Pandorum
358,arronaxtrance,Too much violence and sickness,5,3 June 2010,"First of all, I want to mention that this review is based mostly on my personal taste. I know that there are many people in this world who like to watch violence in movies, especially if it's violence with a lot of mutants/zombies involved. Never figured why is that so, but this movie proves it once more. The audience love fake blood and fake monsters all over the place.However, my personal opinion is that this movie would be better if it wasn't based on a brutal horror story. The beginning of the movie is perfect, it has a brilliant approach to viewers, who will be dragged into the atmosphere in the very first few minutes. Sci-fi elements are very well implemented in the beginning of the storyline, and the actors fit very well into the darker mood of the movie. But, unfortunately, the plot seems to develop in a different manner as the minutes pass by, and it's getting worse as the climax is approaching. As the climax arrives, the whole movie becomes a chase between cannibalistic mutants and crazy survivors of the ship. Another thing that also doesn't fit into this genre is cannibalism, which is too sick for sci-fi. What also bothered me while I was watching Pandorum is the similarity to Event Horizon and Aliens. The director/producer obviously had great inspiration from those two movies, but he obviously failed to implement the main thing: good and intelligent point of the movie. Aliens and Event Horizon are classics, and very intelligent sci-fi horrors with great messages, but Pandorum is a plain brutal killing spree which ends typically: with a new start of humanity on some distant world. It's just what I predicted in the middle of the movie, when they said what their mission was. The only thing which I can really say that I enjoyed in this movie was good acting and the exterior/interior design of the Elysium starship.",Pandorum

It's seriously good with no Hollywood bullshit that you see lately in all American movies... Definitely recommended for anyone who liked alien or played Dead space as there is a lot from it in the movie . There is even a nice twist at the end you don't really expect which add so much to the movie . Dennis Quaid should have more scenes in the movie but in general it was well balanced. Anyone saying this movie is bad has a problem with imagination or doesn't like fantastic movies , then don't post comments nor vote if you went to see it without liking this types of movies. Period.

The ugly human like monster, the awkward love story, and of course the ""Hollywood big movie suit"": professional acting, mainstream special efficacy, thoughtful in details, etc.. So for this mediocre performance, 6/10 points for this movie is very secure. What make this movie finally get 7 form 6 is its delicate and solid story. There are no obvious flaws of the story.The background structure is so huge, endless imagination and possibilities may happened based on that background. I hope there could be a TV show based on this movie to describe the life of human race on Titan planet science Titans year one. Finally, this movie also have a very creative happy ending, which is very rare nowadays. ""you can not count on one thing too much"", this rule could also being applied to movie industry. Sometimes expecting too much form a movie will be a pitfall of its watching experience. On the other hand, watching one movie without knowing anything about it in the first place will, very often, give you a wonderful experience.

Not just killing creatures or humans. The concept deserves a part two i hope they make some money back in DVD, something went wrong with the promotion or marketing of this movie. I rate this with alien one which was fantastic and this movie has a lot more to be told and explored i could have truly watched for three of five hours straight. The fight scenes are good,the size of the ship just kept going and going, the scenery is deep and where the ship lands which is kept for the end really makes you want more towards the end of the movie.I don't want to say to much and spoil the viewing but this one deserves your DVD money.

Ben Foster is really really good in this and I must say that he is getting much better at picking roles, with 3:10 to Yuma and now this! One thing that really stuck out to me also, was how much some of it reminded me of the game Dead Space, don't read into that too much as far as story goes, it's just that there are a few elements that I think were inspired by the game, and if you have played Dead Space, I think you will know what I mean when you see it.

Rating >> 8.1Antibodies director Christian Alvart takes suspense into space with this tale of two astronauts who realize that they aren't alone as they drift into the darkest corners of our galaxy. Awakening in their hyper-sleep chamber with no memory of who they are or what their mission is, disoriented astronauts Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) gradually surmise that they are the only ones aboard the darkened spacecraft. But how did they get here, and what are those strange sounds coming from the belly of the ship? The only way out of their hyper-sleep chamber is a narrow air shaft, and the only one small enough to climb through it is Corporal Bower. As the younger of the two space travelers shimmies inside, the older remains behind to offer guidance on the radio transmitter. But the deeper Corporal Bower ventures into the ship, the more apparent it becomes that something horrible has happened. Could it be that the survival of the entire human race rests in the hands of these two astronauts stuck on a lonely ship in deep space?",Pandorum

367,criticaltom,The Decent meets Event Horizon.,4,4 October 2009,"Pandorum has been thrown into the current releases as the latest Sci-Fi horror from the makers of Resident Evil; a trilogy of progressively underwhelming instalments loosely based around a succession of very popular computer games. However Resident Evil's director Paul W.S. Anderson is only the driving force behind Pandorum, taking the role of producer and leaving the director's job to Christian Alvart of whose previous few movies include Antikörper (Antibodies); a very well constructed German language film about the fictional serial killer Gabriel Engel. Pandorum begins unashamedly as so many Sci-Fi films have since the 1979 release of Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien with us being introduced to a small room occupied by cryogenic sleeping capsules aboard an interminable Space Vessel drifting through unfathomable darkness and stars. Within minutes we are introduced to our two main protagonists; Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid) who have been awoken from hyper sleep early for reasons unknown in very familiar Event Horizon fashion. Both of them are suffering from an amnesic side effect of the long sleep and in plot inducing convenience fail to recall their reasons for being on the ship or how long they have been asleep for. It is soon established that the power on the ship is down and that Bower must find a way passed a number of locked bulkhead doors which are incapacitated whilst Payton takes up the job of hanging around a budget set of a cockpit providing reassuring intercom dialog that everything is going to be OK. Of course it is.Bower then discovers the death of several crew members, some of which are in the later stages of decomposition and after a run in from what at first glance would seem like Alice from Resident Evil: Extinction he is forced to run and hide in a locker from the roaming horrors that quickly infest the darkened corridors. Once the beasts have been acknowledged, and to some degree disregarded, it is established that the ship is soon to run out of power and in an amazing coincidence Bower regains his memory of being a technical engineer and sets out to reboot the failing reactor. The remainder of the film then plays out from two perspectives, the first of which follows Bower on his quest through the consistently dark ship to save what might remain of the crew and the second following Payton as he is confronted by moral decisions from an eerie new crew member Gallo (Cam Gigandet) who he discovered cowering in a wall panel. The rest of the film then pivots between cheap horror scares and gore, and disappointing linear plot dialog progression which leads up to an acceptable yet somewhat unfulfilling ending.This is not to say that Pandorum is without merit, there are a good few scares in the film and even thought the dark corridors are way overplayed it does help to add to a sense of atmosphere, it is just a shame that there is no originality in the movie to make any scene rememberable. The monsters do have a genuine fear factor about them but are almost clear cut from the movie The Descent; a much better executed British horror movie about cave spelunkers. As the movie progresses and new characters are introduced it seems that the theme of the movie gets split between horror action and psychological thriller, but just doesn't manage to integrate the two so seamlessly and leaves you with quite an open ended feeling; which makes you not so much care about the present narrative, as makes you want to skip right to the Twilight Zone ending.Pandorum is a film which hits all the right notes of an average movie, it pushes no boundaries and raises no bars but as Sci-Fi horror it is one of a dying breed and only has some of the best past movies to compare its self too so it falls short of great, the acting from the main cast is adequate but the script is poor and with so many scenes linked directly with other movies of a similar nature it comes off as a lazy attempt at the genre. But that said, it is the first Sci-Fi horror film for a while, and even though there is no originality, cheap scares and a lot of the action is too convoluted to even tell what is going on, it does give a shimmering light that the Sci-Fi Horror genre is not forgotten.",Pandorum

374,saberme-781-928150,Give it a chance! (Flawed but worth seeing),7,3 July 2010,"A lot of people seem to hate this movie with a passion, but it is not bad at all. There are much worse movies out there that I've had the unfortunate experience of sitting through, but more about Pandorum...Although the feel of the movie is very reminiscent of Alien with claustrophobic spacecraft situations, the plot revolves around a completely different idea: Earth is in ruins from (implied) war, environmental destruction, population etc... and a space ship is sent out to the only other Earth-like planet reachable via flight, Tanis.Here is where it gets interesting: Pandorum opens with a Colonel Bower waking up from cryogenic-like sleep on what seems to be an abandoned ship. He has no sense of time, how long he was asleep or where in the universe the ship is. The plot takes off from this point; Bower attempts to figure out what is going on amidst the frenzy of creatures on board.The creatures are Pandorum's main flaw. They are completely necessary to tie in loose ends and make the movie interesting, but too much of them was shown. This resulted in a lowered scariness factor. I also feel like the writers who thought up the creatures tried too hard to incorporate different 'powers' and 'coolness' factors. The end product are creatures that aren't well explained and seem scattered.This movie does not follow the traditional horror plot. Although characters die, there is no group of 10 kids getting picked off one by one steadily as the movie progresses. In a few cases the deaths are even due to character conflict, making it all the more interesting to watch.The last thing I want to address without spoiling anything is the ending. I have seen a lot of people criticize it as a ""Hollywood ending"" but honestly, it fits the story line.Nowadays people are concerned with trying to be as different as possible instead of looking at what the best fitting ending might be, whether it be a happy, sad, open-ended or completely tied up ending. Pandorum is a departure from this train of thought. It is ridiculed for having an ending fitting to the story, which is not a bad quality at all.As with most movies, it has its flaws, however Pandorum is generally a good movie for any one who likes science fiction or horror. Anyone who believes it is garbage should really consider the plethora of other movies out there (try ""Razortooth"") that actually deserve the low ratings.Bottom line: If you enjoy sci-fi, go see it. Pandorum is no Alien, but despite its heavy influence from other movies, it is still entertaining and well made.Appreciate it for what it is.",Pandorum

What makes this film excellent? The deep space setting, the monsters/aliens, the ""Dead Space"" type of atmosphere (not to mention some other tricks that eerily recalled the video game story) and feel are all very well done and executed. While the movie doesn't avoid some clichés of the genre, they are presented naturally and are not as jarring as one would expect. But what makes this an instant classic for me is that this is not a 'horror' flick in my opinion, though absolutely falls into the SciFi/Horror genre. It is a film about the dark side of human nature. As with 28 Days Later, the real monsters aren't the strange violent creatures we encounter in the film - they are just a setting. The real monsters are the people who survive. And that is much scarier, because people are capable of much greater evil then simple violence.A 6.9 rating severely underrates this movie, and it really is a crime that it was so poorly marketed and lost so much money.

381,max-rainin,Pandorum. The men after Earth.,8,16 June 2011,"A movie by German director Christian Alvart, whose works are marked with contradictory appraisals of critics. His previous ""Antibodies"" and ""Case 39"", constructed as ordinary thrillers and refer-ring to such classics of this genre as ""The silence of the lambs"" and ""The Omen"", are actually filled with totally different from classical content. This dissonance of genre and plot breeds confusion and misunderstanding. Meanwhile it absolutely fits the situation of postmodern mixed culture. All these features are crystallized in ""Pandorum"". The plot. Spaceship ""Elysium"" (antique word, means ""the country of the blessed"") is floating through the stars to the planet Tanis. Crew members wakes up without memories. They try to figure out what's going on with the ship and they discover, that it's filled with horrifying, carnivorous mutants and it's reactor is about to stop. Through the narrow corridors and gloomy iron decks they sneak to the reactor, reload it and escape the ship, which all this time was on the bottom of Tanis' sea. Kinda happy ending. Simple and ordinary scenario. But, all the screen time you're caught by the atmosphere of claustrophobia and schizophrenia creeping upon your skin as drops of nasty water. It's achieved by back-ground and actors' playing. As Foster's and Traue's characters hiding from mutants under the layer of human bare bones or Quaid's double personality character struggling his previous, hallucinatory identity, your mind starts to confuse itself, looking for effects of previous causes. That only increases the sense of inevitability. But this state is equalized by survival struggle scenes, when the personage of Cung Le uses martial arts to fight evil antagonists or brave girl Traue escaping them like qualified traceur. But these are only visible features. The significance. What distinguish this film from others post-apocalyptic and sci-fi movies is in-imitable philosophical contest between egotistic and altruistic motives within the human. To survive alone by killing or together by helping each other. Much closer to illustrate the Price equation, then the ""WAZ"". Another side of within struggle is the question how to behave and who to be in the open space, in the emptiness, nowhere, while Earth doesn't exist anymore. Here comes ""pandorum"" - a psychological disorder with it's symptoms: memory loss, hallucinations and unmotivated violence, sharpening with the fear of inevitability. This thing leads Quaid's personage to absolute denial, makes him say: ""The god has died together with the Earth"" and to become amoral monster, much similar to mutants, flooded the ship. He loses all the bounds of law, the sense of retribution, and for this he is punished by the forces of Good (sweet couple of Traue and Foster). So this is to say in spirit of Camus: ""The absence of god doesn't mean the absence of morality"". And all the bad asses should be savagely killed. This after-Earth situation, post-humanity conditions shows concluded picture of unbound mind. Nothing is left and nothing to evaluate. Alvart opens the possibility of this state and then quickly closes it with happy ending and new beginning of human's life on Tanis. This is the way how all his films go: opening of disputable issue, complicated contest of good and evil, than settlement with the victory of good. If deduct happy ending, we'll get Richard Kelly, twisted on Christian theology. The middle part, one for interest, one filled with reflection, is left moved away the scene. Also these half-baked mutants with nowhere taken martial arts skills... some nonsense. In whole, it represents a kind of bizarre and cruel postmodern mixture, suitable for mass show and Hollywood conveyor. P. S. Enjoy the view of dirty Traue's breasts.",Pandorum
382,hectorjunk2,More like Resident Evil than Aliens,4,21 March 2012,"I'm not sure why everybody refers Pandorum to ""Aliens"", because in my opinion it's far more related to ""Resident Evil"", specially its high-tech video game visual style, the way the camera rotates and cuts around, the short and snappy dialogs, etc.In fact, its dark, apocalyptic, gloomy and claustrophobic atmosphere reminded me more on ""Pitch Black"" than ""Aliens"". Again, I'm talking about its visual style and script.AT ITS CORE, PANDORUM IS A ZOMBIES FILM SET IN OUTER SPACE. You know the drill: the main characters running around the ship being chased by hordes of zombie-like creatures, trying to get the heck out of there without getting eaten along the way.Given the plot, it would have been much better if had been written as a psychological horror movie rather than a zombie movie. I mean, how many of these run-away-because-the-critters-are-after-you movies can we take, no matter whether they're set in outer space or in a farming village in Ohio?Not a bad entertainment for a popcorn-feasting late-night session if you like Sci-Fi horror, but definitely not a cult film in any way. I'll give it a 5 out of 10. It might keep you entertained, but in all honesty it simply is not a good movie.",Pandorum
383,zoran15,Brilliant,10,7 April 2012,"Unexpectedly good movie. Good atmosphere and quick action,without boring parts.This movie proofs that you can make interesting film with low budget.Design is great,especially the ship, which looks fantastic.Modern SF hybrid which came out from nowhere in the year of Avatar,Star Trek,District 9,and Moon.I will remember 2009,as very good year for SF movies.Excellent choice of actors.Ben Foster,Denis Quaid,and Antje Traue.I would like to see Pandorum 2,although i know that it not very likely to happen.",Pandorum
384,karzael,"""Sci-fi Horror"" at its finest",8,9 May 2013,"I had the pleasure of watching this title without first being exposed to any spoilers. This I feel made the difference to what could have been a hollow movie. There are several plot twists and even when you think you've seen them all, you haven't.While I won't discuss the plot (For reasons above), I would say that while Antje Traue's performance is sadly too physical and under used, Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid more than make up for it. They have difficult psychological roles to play and apart from one scene, perform them admirably. Cung Le's appearance is more for action, though the language barrier gimmick, though largely unused adds to the tension and to Ben Foster's desperation.The ""monsters"" I felt could have been done better, but are more than enough to evoke whats required for this type of film. It was more the unknown that gets you than the threat of danger. You may well guess the ending, but I guarantee you it won't be early, nor easy. There were several scenes I thought could have added to the movie, but had not been made probably due to time constraints. However, there were no distinct plot holes and when one begins the process of ""nit picking"" you know you've found a good one.Still, this is one of those movies that will leave you wanting to watch it again after being told the truth, just to watch for all those hints you may or may not have missed.Terribly mistreated by critics, Pandorum as one critic described it was ""a B movie with A movie treatment."" Indeed, despite a relatively light budget the film pulls off incredibly with perfect actors for the roles, awesome sets, above average lines, grungy hopeless atmosphere all round. However the critics seem to have largely rated this movie as a AAA movie and thus downgraded it. On one case, a critic started his attacking review with ""Fans of Scifi will love it, but..."" I didn't read on, as I realized to my horror that this and many other critics had reviewed this sci-fi horror as a movie meant for all audiences. Such idiocy really depicts the corrupt and horribly falling critic environment these days, echoing the ""controlled"" game critic arena too well.Pandorum was a delightful surprise, especially after watching the disappointing Iron Man 3 at the cinema. Its best watched in the dark, with no preamble or prior knowledge of the plot. Like any good horror. It is essentially, Sci-fi Horror at its finest. For so little in the way of budget, it shames high budget AAA movies in the same field. It drips with atmosphere and the sets spit on movies such as Aliens Resurrection, using every element from lighting to suggestion to unnerve the audience. Go. Watch. Judge for yourself. Though if your hands start shaking...Thanks for reading. R",Pandorum
385,zero132132,Smarter than most sci-fi,8,26 January 2014,"Some people will disagree vehemently with my position; this movie is smarter than most sci-fi. The people that disagree will largely be drawing comparisons to movies like Alien or whatever else they want to, but this movie was well-received by me (and some friends of mine) for one simple reason: it doesn't cheat.The overwhelming majority of science fiction is heavily reliant on confusing the reader/viewer with technobabble that's essentially meaningless. In most science fiction, they gloss over numerous impossibilities every minute either through technobabble or generous applications of handwavium. There's nothing particularly wrong with that, but as someone that notices even relatively small technical problems in movies, it can be really annoying.This movie doesn't cheat, which is somewhat rare in science fiction. It doesn't break its own rules, and it only barely breaks the real world's rules. There are only 2 plot contrivances that seem particularly unscientific and are glossed over without a thought (hypersleep and something that may be a moderate spoiler).If you get annoyed at unexplained, impossible crap the way I do, you might find this movie refreshing.",Pandorum
386,johan-962-164832,Dark sci-fi with great acting,10,30 March 2014,"Very dark and atmospheric sci-fi thriller with superb actors all around, excellent imagery, really good psychological exploration and quite a good story and storytelling as well.I just hope for a sequel.I also like to say that the 10-line-minimum rule for posting reviews is very bad. Keep it short and simple i'd say.I've seen others complain about this as well, and they always get answers like: you need to think and explain why you like or dislike the movie. Well, some of us are able to do that in just a few lines. So please change that rule.",Pandorum
387,seattleattack,one of my faves,9,21 May 2014,"This wonderful, intense action, scifi movie has actually a lot going on for it. When I first saw the trailer I instantly wanted to see it but still had some doubts. Man I'm glad I watched it. Ben foster is a really good actor and if you don't think so then you don't know what your acting is. The monsters are great looking and scary. The suspense is regularly there. Just overall good movie. Now.... it's not perfect. Sometimes there some lines and the way they say them that leaves you saying... did he actually Just say that? But hey. ... there allot of movies like that. Overall, if your a fan of the subgenre of scifi/horror then this movies got it all. Not to mention the end is fricken awesome!!!!!!",Pandorum
388,ragingnewborn,"Story good, filming not so",6,4 May 2015,"I would have reviewed this movie better if the film style wasn't so jarring. I found it almost impossible at times to tell what was actually going on.I really was fascinated by the plot of this movie, but sadly it was very difficult to actually follow. The sequence where you find out what actually happened on the ship was very hard to follow, jumping between one guy being very vague, some pictures, and a crazy guy speaking poetry.It's very sad that this movie wasn't done better, the general story (once I had looked it up to figure what actually had happened on the ship) was very original. It's a huge shame it wasn't made better",Pandorum
389,dupeeppenguin,eh,6,12 December 2014,"Began extremely well , almost immediately a strong sense of loneliness and claustrophobia took me by surprise before I even could make sense of what was happening as far as plot goes, which only made the feeling all the more intense. Unfortunately this quickly began descending into a more well lit, cliché creature fest filled with expendable characters, the sense of helplessness and the actual feeling of ""wow this guy remembers nothing and is basically alone and might succumb to an ill fate"" disappears , you know whos getting out alive and that everythings going to be cheeky run of the mill bullshit from here on with a story line that doesn't really matter until the end of the movie . Overall I must say I was disappointed, Tension soon became simply being annoyed. however! I did enjoy watching it and would recommend people give it a try but, personally I just dislike where it all went, I do prefer Alien over Aliens though and this was sorta like a mix of both",Pandorum
390,mattmarshal,A spectacularly undervalued Sci-Fi gem!,10,18 January 2015,"Although I'm usually in alignment with the critics, I thoroughly disagree with them on this one. I watch A LOT of movies, and really enjoy sci-fi when it's exceptional. But it HAS to be well made.If you like ""Aliens"", zombie apocalypses, ""Mad Max"", and descents into madness set to a lost-in-space astro-tragedy, you will love this movie. Although it admittedly has an intense and complex plot, it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The visuals are stunning and frightening, and the performances from the cast, outstanding. Such an order of filmmaking is difficult to execute competently, but I feel Christian Avart does it justice. I rank it right at the top of the best sci-fi thrillers ever made, with ""Prometheus"" and the ""Aliens"" movies, the ""Predator"" movies, and ""World War Z"". While watching, I kept thinking what a good series it would make, both within the existing plot and beyond. Would so love to see a sequel!!",Pandorum
391,amanpatel-83914,Might as well the worst movie I will ever see,1,20 September 2020,"This movie is highly overreated . I saw the title in some MindBender movie list which by the way im a die hard fan of. Most of those movies are not good from the start to the end but there is some factor which keeps you glued to the screen because you know the end will make it all worth it.This movie just couldn'd do it for me. The characters reactions to scenarios were awkward, the plot was lame af. Not one scene with proper lighting conditions, I CONSTANTLY had to adjust the volume since the dialogs were inaudible and the action scenes and roars of some creatures were extremely loud. At one point in the movie my speakers got disconnected in between the dialogs and I kept reading the subtitles for a good 2 minutes before realizing there is no sound.Overall This was a total waste of time. I did not even bother to watch till the end after the reveal near the end, it was so unsettling.",Pandorum
392,claudiocosta,So many plot holes...,3,30 July 2015,"Really, too many plot holes. I don't even know where to start to list them, so I won't. This movie looks to me as a missed occasion, mostly. And it's kind of sad because there is some good stuff here and there. Despite the similarities with other films (Alien comes to mind) Pandorum could have been something original and interesting... unfortunately, the overall impression is one of frustration. Like who wrote the script didn't put in enough effort or time to check their own work. Calling this a B-movie might be a bit far-fetched, but the screenplay definitely is of B quality. To be honest, it's quite surprising that several users here gave high marks but, hey, to each their own ;)",Pandorum

394,jasondrewlee,Excellent Space Movie - must see if you are into sci-fi/horror fan,10,30 June 2016,"In my opinion no one can top this movie because this is the Best Excellent, Outstanding space movie ever. For me this is the best sci-fi in the last decade, the only one which I enjoyed from beginning to the end without being bored for just one minute or even half of minute ! Very suspenseful and engaging throughout. This was and is, an excellent movie well scripted, awesome acting and surprising twists leave this movie with you catch into it. A must watch for space thriller fans! Dark, full of terror, suspense, really excellent movie, excellent acting of Ben Foster and Antje Traue...Hopefully there's coming second part of the movie Pandorum isn't suppose to be an action space flick, it's not a generic star wars clone And it is defiantly not a AvP off. It isn't supposed to be, this movie is more of mystery suspense with a mint of tragedy. I thought this movie wasn't going to be good at all, but I was way wrong! This movie is extremely awesome. It kind of reminded me of Dead Space. Great story (always kept you trying to figure things out) a must see. This movie has Intense, very scary, great actors and a space ship full of monsters. Great set design and the movie has its own feel. Original story line (not another reboot), A bit like aliens/event horizon/and a zombie movie so perfect for me I LOVED IT!!!!! In addition this is vastly underrated movie. One of the best space films of recent years. Great story, with plenty of twists and a great ending, cool mutant design as well I found it so amazing!, reminds me Dead Space video game. It's a survival horror movie which has its thrilling moments, really very good story and creepy creatures. I enjoyed much more than the last 5 Resident evil and other space movies, so for me this one is the best Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen. Excellent cast, involving story, crazy action, scary moments, adventurous. a very excellent movie to watch at night in the dark. Worth buying, entertaining enough to watch more than once. Alien, Event Horizon, and now Pandorum - Gothic science- fiction horror. Pandorum is an original story with a great twist that actually make s sense, excellent acting with believable characters, all in an imaginative environment. Its dark, very scary, and very serious stuff. EXTREMELY EXCELLENT AMAZING MOVIE!",Pandorum

And yet when one of the survivors appears on screen and opens his mouth to speak his dialog, he's got the whitest damned teeth you've ever seen.

After seeing it, it completely surprised me. Could easily be a cult classic like Pitch Black. A lot of elements to it that made it interesting. I feel like everything has been done as far as sci-fi space thrillers but this combined elements of a variety of different movies. It had a little bit of Aliens, some Event Horizon, and some Memento all rolled in one. Hard to explain all the different elements but they fit together well through out the course of the movies. Very interesting. Please don't ruin this movie by making make a sequel like the Chronicles of Riddick. A sequel couldn't work.",Pandorum

400,xmrmeow,A great unpredictable Sci-fi horror thriller,9,8 July 2018,"This movie isn't perfect, but it deserves a hell of a lot higher score than these bone-head critics gave it. Most movies these days are incredibly predictable and horror director's idea of scary is little girls and jump scares. This movie had me on the edge of my seat for nearly the entire time with a few short low points to give you a chance to catch your breathe. Most of what happened I completely didn't see coming, ye that's right, I had to actually watch the movie to know what going to happen instead of being able to see every twist coming from a mile away like every modern movie I've seen in the last 5 years. The plot was pieced together nicely throughout the film, and all the twists were interesting and fun to watch. They weren't unpredictable because they were nonsensical, but because the movie doesn't act like usual Hollywood and take the most obvious direction because it's the safe way to make it.",Pandorum
401,etown_cowboy,I'm sorry but i don't get the hype,2,12 November 2009,"Hi, i saw this movie yesterday and honestly I didn't like it at all. When i read all the positive comments I really was surprised.The first half hour of the movie consists of Foster running or crawling trough some dark corridor. Quaid basically just sits on his behind yelling ""are you there Bower?"" or ""Can you here me Bower?"" which is followed by some more running or crawling by Foster.Then u get your typical ""safe house""-point in the movie where a character has the time to explain some stuff that has happened. Which is of course followed by some more running in the dark.After 15 minutes in the movie you just know that you are gonna get an attempt to a plot twist/ surprise ending, which ruins the surprise of course. I really think it's stupid that since the usual suspects or the sixth sense movie makers think: ""If u have a plot twist your movie is always a hit"" Well let me state this once and for all:""YOU CAN TRY AS HARD AS YOU WANT. THE MINUTE THE AUDIENCE KNOWS THERE IS GONNA BE A PLOT TWIST YOUR ATTEMPT AT MAKING ONE HAS FAILED."" Also i would like to state that i'm not a ""hater"" but a ""lover"" of the scifi-genre AND horror-genre and that comparing this poor piece of cinema with alien , the descent or event horizon (wich was 10 times as scary, i had to stay in my seat for 5 minutes watching the end credits before i could relax and get up) is just wrong. OK i like the attempt of making a scifi/horror, but this was just one big disappointing movie, i was blind sighted by the posters and the title and the premise of this movie. there is so much u can do with a theme like insanity in space and consequences of hyper sleep, but this movie fails miserably in it.",Pandorum
