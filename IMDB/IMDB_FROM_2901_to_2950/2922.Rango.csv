0,MartinHafer,Annoying.....,3,13 May 2012,"I've gotta admit up front that I am not a huge Johnny Depp fan and frankly think I've seen enough of him for some time. Now I am not saying he isn't talented—he certainly is. But so often his films have 'mega-hit' written all over them and the public throngs to his films like lemmings—and I just think I've seen enough. Plus, he's in practically EVERYTHING these days and I just wish he'd take a break. This is especially true in ""Rango"" as if you love Depp, great...but if you don't, you'll probably REALLY hate the film. That's because Depp's character talks practically non-stop--and is about as subtle as Ebola. And, frankly, so many of the characters and the music to this film is just LOUD, LOUD and LOUD!!! I just kept wishing the film hadn't tried so hard. In my daughter's words, ""there doesn't seem to be any plot...just Johnny Depp screaming a lot"". Ditto.This is all a big shame, as apart from being a loud and obnoxious film, the CGI is AMAZING--and among the best I've seen so far. It's a quality production but annoying--and the rottenness of the Best Animated Film category was terrible for 2012 if this film ended up winning! In my opinion, they should have just not given an award instead of rewarding such a film.",Rango
1,TheLittleSongbird,Wasn't expecting something this good so early on in the year...,9,4 March 2011,"I heard from a number of people that this was excellent so I went to see it myself being a fan of animated movies and of film in general. And I absolutely loved it, other than being a little too long, which is such a minor complaint, it was a wonderful film with some surprisingly mature themes and does very well at trying something different.The animation for starters is outstanding. Not only do the characters move convincingly, but the colours look gorgeous and the backgrounds are imaginative and stunning. The soundtrack is another plus, the score is wonderful with a sense of fun, great use of instruments and nods to Ennio Morricone, without being too generic or over-the-top with some inspired musical flavour to it.The script is funny, smart and quirky as well- loved the Chinatown(Ned Beatty based his performance on that of John Huston's), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Star Wars references- the characters are genuine and likable with heart and don't fall into the trap of being too cliché(there are some but it works in the film's favour and I loved the title character), the film goes at a great pace while remaining wholly satisfying at its end with an almost elegiac quality that is there with almost all the best westerns, the slapstick action bounces along nicely and the story is far from formulaic instead it is original and inventive. The voice acting is wonderful, both Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy- Rattlesnake Jake is awesome!- give knockout performances, while Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Harry Dean Stanton and Abigail Breslin are equally terrific.In conclusion, a wonderful film that I wasn't expecting to be this good this early on in the year. On a side note, for those complaining about suitability for children, I actually wouldn't say this was a film for kids but more adult-oriented. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Rango
2,Leofwine_draca,Western tropes reposited as CGI animal comedy,4,5 July 2017,"RANGO is one of those interminable all-star-voice-cast animations that Hollywood churn out for the kids. These films always have lame, action-focused plots that feel repetitive in the extreme, and are chock-full of in-jokes and references for their parents taking the kids along. This one is an extremely clichéd western adventure in which a mild-mannered chameleon becomes sheriff of a western town and has to clear up trouble. Johnny Depp slums it as the lead while the various voice actors play the parts of various stereotypes. The best thing about it is the use of classical themes on the soundtrack, but I didn't care for the cold CGI work and the action is interminable. The Man With No Name's cameo is the best thing about this.",Rango
3,SnoopyStyle,Jack Sparrow as a lizard,7,10 February 2014,"Rango (Johnny Depp) is a hyper imaginative pet chameleon. When his family loses him out the back of their car, he is left to fend for himself in the middle of a desert. He escapes from a deadly hawk to find a western town called Dirt. The drought has made water incredibly valuable. Through luck and circumstances, Rango become the sheriff, but he is hopelessly clueless.This is a very well made Nickelodeon animated movie. I wonder if this is going to be a new competitor to the animated field. The animation looks crisp and lively. The only missing element is cuter characters. Lizards are very odd for animation especially if you do it relatively realistic. But it fits very well to the setting of an old decaying western.Rango is a very original character which actually is reminiscent of Johnny Depp's other big character Jack Sparrow. Does the fact that this is a reunion between Pirates director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp has anything to do with it? The comedy comes from a similar place, and it works well here as well.",Rango
4,Hitchcoc,"Once Again, Listen to the Venom",8,5 May 2019,"Rango manages to appeal to many interests. First of all, the recreation of the old West is charming. The animators have done a masterful job of producing a setting that really works. The chameleon star finds himself in Dirt, the aforementioned town, and is given the task of saving the water supply. Yes, it is a bit dark and the plot is sophisticated. So why so many 1's and 2's. Is it that people are so easily bored when their minds are a bit challenged by an animated film? This is one of the better films of the year and works on many levels. It also parodies tough Westerns that we have seen in contemporary times.",Rango
5,claudio_carvalho,No Man Can Walk Out of His Own Story,9,28 April 2012,"A family is crossing the desert by car with their lizard in an aquarium. The driver is forced to an abrupt movement to avoid an accident and the aquarium falls off the car on the road.The female lizard Beans gives a ride to the lizard up to an old western town called Dirt and he goes to the bar expecting to drink water. The braggart lizard tells that he is a dangerous gunslinger called Rango and the impressed locals believe that Rango is a hero and invite him to be the sheriff. Sooner Rango finds that water is missing in town and the Major has a suspicious behavior. But when the evil Rattlesnake Jake arrives in town, Rango assumes that he is a coward and quits his position. He walks to the road but the Spirit of the West convinces him to return and fight for those that had believed in him.""Rango"" is one of the funniest and most originals animations that I have recently seen with a parody to western movies and a tribute to Clint Eastwood, the stranger without a name, in ""High Plains Drifter"".The voice and the way of speaking of Johnny Depp are also hilarious. The 2012 Oscar of Best Animated Feature Film of the Year is in good hands. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Rango""",Rango
6,kosmasp,Skin I live in,7,14 December 2011,"I only watched the version that ran in the cinemas, so I can't comment on the extended Edition that is available on Disc. I personally liked the fact, that the movie didn't follow the trend to go 3-D (though you never know what ""clever"" marketing people will do in the future). I also liked the fact that the movie is goofy but also deep when it comes to its main character (spoken by none other then Johnny Depp).A great main character is always helping, but you also need good supporting characters. And you got them here too. While the story may unfold pretty much as you would expect it to, what will stay with you are the characters. And hopefully some of the jokes too.",Rango
7,classicsoncall,"""Ain't no one gonna tango with the Rango!""",8,17 December 2011,"Well I've seen all manner of Western stories - TV Westerns, revisionist Westerns, spaghetti Westerns - but this was my very first lizard Western. I have to say, I enjoyed the animated venue, but if you're a Western fan, the story itself isn't going to offer anything new or creative. The hero chameleon Rango goes up against the crooked town boss and Mayor of Dirt, who's been buying up all the property around the town while controlling the local water supply. As usual there's a lone hold out, in this case the female lizard character known as Beans. When things look a little shaky for the Mayor, he brings in his gun for hire, Rattlesnake Jake to put an end to Rango's quest. I had to chuckle over the Rattlesnake's appearance, he had the faintest of a moustache line across his lip reminding me of so many Western villains. The picture inadvertently and I'm sure unintentionally pays homage to the little known 1975 Mexican Western ""Dead Aim"" which makes clever use of 'rattlesnake music' whenever a tense situation occurs.However there are overt nods to other better known films that most viewers will be able to recognize. The first real battle action sequence is patterned after Luke Skywalker's aerial assault in the canyons of the Death Star. Then there's that real neat touch when Rango meets the Spirit of the West, a throwback to Eastwood's Man With No Name character. ""It's the deeds that make the man"" the Spirit says to Rango, and from that point on, our hero forges ahead to face his destiny. Was there ever any doubt that the final showdown would take place at High Noon? With all that, I think it's pretty safe to say that this isn't really a kids movie, even though the marketing for the picture seemed to paint it that way. The setting of Dirt and the grimy characters give the picture a dark and forbidding overcast, and though I'm no prude, I found a scene with Rango hugging a topless female doll form to be somewhat disturbing. That just sort of creeped me out when I saw it, and made me rethink an invitation to my granddaughter to watch the picture with me. She didn't after all, so I didn't have to do any explaining. There was also a line from a song referencing 'refried beans and booger blood' that wasn't particularly appetizing as I ate my dinner while watching the picture, but I could see how little boys would get a kick out of that one.",Rango
8,gavin6942,Grossly Overrated Film,6,21 April 2012,"Rango (Johnny Depp) is an ordinary chameleon who accidentally winds up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West in desperate need of a new sheriff.How this film won the Oscar for best animated film of 2011 is beyond me. All I can think is that there just were not very strong contenders for the prize (I know I cannot think of any). I will say the animation itself is amazing -- it is quite possibly the best animation I have ever seen. So, George Lucas, you have outdone Pixar and you should be proud.And I will also say I enjoyed the references to ""True Grit"", Clint Eastwood and Lee VanCleef. Oh ,and Hunter Thompson. I think those were an excellent touch. I wish that Eastwood himself could have lent his distinctive voice.But the film does seem to just feel very flat for me. While the plot is alright, I could not get myself to care about the characters. Who lived or died was of little consequence to me... even Rango himself was not much of a hero.Roger Ebert says the film is ""wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical"" and he gives it four stars! The review is a big, slobbery kiss with repeated calls to see it and bring your family. I guess whatever Ebert was drinking must not be in my refrigerator.",Rango
9,lee_eisenberg,no one expects a western (or an animated feature) to mention Kim Novak,6,9 November 2019,"Having directed Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Gore Verbinski had him voice the lead role in the Academy Award-winning ""Rango"". The movie has a common plot, but what caught my eye were the pop culture references. We get references to the spaghetti westerns, natch, but also to ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", ""Chinatown"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and others. The tykes can enjoy the gags while the adults can laugh at the references. An OK movie. I guess that its overall message is to develop responsibly.Worth seeing.",Rango
10,jboothmillard,Rango,6,15 June 2016,"I had seen many images and maybe a couple of clips of this computer- animated movie, and I knew the leading actor voicing, as for anything about it, I just waited until I watched it, directed by Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt, The Ring, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, The Lone Ranger). Basically a pet chameleon (Johnny Depp) is stranded in the Mojave Desert, on the road he meets armadillo Roadkill (Alfred Molina), who directs him to a town called Dirt. The chameleon narrowly avoids being eaten by a vicious red-tailed hawk before meeting desert iguana and rancher's daughter Beans (Isla Fisher), who takes him to Dirt, an Old West town populated by desert animals, the chameleon uses bravado and improvisation to fit in, presenting himself as a tough drifter, giving himself the name Rango. He quickly has a collision with outlaw Gila monster Bad Bill (Ray Winstone), but avoids a shootout when the hawk returns, Rango is chased by the hawk, but accidentally shoots and knocks down an empty water tower, which crushes the bird, the elderly tortoise Mayor (Ned Beatty) appoints Rango the new sheriff, but with the hawk dead, the townspeople worry gunslinger Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), who feared the bird, will return. Dirt's water reserves, stored in the town bank inside a water cooler bottle, is nearly empty, sceptical Beans tells Rango he should investigate where the water has disappeared to. However, in the night, Rango inadvertently assists a trio of bank robbers, led by mole Balthazar (Harry Dean Stanton), mistaking them for prospectors, when the townsfolk discover the water bottle has been stolen Rango organises a posse. Bank manager Merrimack (Stephen Root) is discovered dead in the desert, he was somehow drowned, despite the town's lack of water, the posse and the robbers then fight over the stolen water in a canyon chase, after which the robbers profess they found the bottle empty, but they are brought for trial. The mayor is buying land around Dirt, he denies any wrongdoing and tells Rango he is building a modern city, but the mayor hires Rattlesnake Jake to run Rango out of town, and make him admit everything he told the town about himself is a lie. Rango leaves ashamed and confused about his identity, but in the middle of nowhere he meets the Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant), the Man With No Name, who Roadkill told him about, the Spirit inspires Rango to return to town and put things right. Rango learns that Dirt's water supply, located outside of Las Vegas, is controlled by an emergency shut-off valve in a water pipeline, the mayor has manipulated to cause drought and buy the land, Rango recruits the robbers to help him restore order to Dirt. Rango makes a diversion by calling out Jake for a duel, while the clan can turn the pipeline valve and flood the town with water, Rango eventually gets one over on the Mayor and his men and washing them away, in the end the Dirt citizens celebrate the return of the water and recognise Rango as their hero. Also starring Abigail Breslin as Priscilla, Ian Abercrombie as Ambrose and Gil Birmingham as Wounded Bird. A chameleon with a big imagination but a self- questioning personality in the wild west during the modern day, it is fairly simple if a little weird, but the voices are chosen well, the jokes including spoofs of Spaghetti Westerns with Clint Eastwood, Apocalypse Now, Star Wars and others are funny enough, and the animation to create the walking talking animals and the world they inhabit is fantastic, it may have clichés, but overall it is a fun animated action comedy western. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Good!",Rango
11,Tweekums,A delightful animated western,8,8 July 2016,"Rango is a pet chameleon who finds himself lost in the searing heat of the Mojave Desert. Seeking water he heads to the town if Dirt, meeting an iguana named Beans on the way. Once there he is confronted by the locals and makes up some rather tall tales that lead them to believe he is a stone cold killer of a gunslinger. A lucky shot when he is confronts the hawk that was terrorising the town persuades them that what he said must be true. The mayor makes Rango the new sheriff and soon he is hunting down bank robbers who have stolen the town's limited water reserve. His posse catch the suspects but they claim to be innocent; Rango starts to suspect somebody else is behind the disappearance of the water.This animated western was a lot of fun with plenty of laughs to be had as well as a fun story. Most of the jokes can be enjoyed by all viewers but some are clearly aimed at older viewers some may think these aren't suitable for younger viewers but I suspect most of these jokes would go over the heads of youngsters. There is plenty of action, including some which may be a little scary for very young viewers namely any scene featuring 'Rattlesnake Jake'. The CGI animation is impressive and the voice cast do a fine job bringing their characters to life; most notably Johnny Depp and Isla Blair as Rango and Beans respectively. Overall I'd recommend this to all but the youngest of children, and especially anybody who enjoys westerns.",Rango
12,paul_haakonsen,A great western animation...,8,11 January 2013,"For an animated movie, then ""Rango"" was a really, really entertaining experience, and it was one that appeals to just about every age. With lovable characters, a good story, comedy, action and laughs.The story is about the lizard Rango who ends up at the western town of Dirt after a car accident. Here Rango gets the chance to play a heroic person, but soon finds that his tall tales catch up with him and the citizens of Dirt come to count of him to be their heroic sheriff.""Rango"" offers a great variety of colorful characters, that are all very unique and interesting. Each character is given its own unique set of personal traits and distinctive characteristics, and it is clear that a lot of work has gone into the character design. And the amazing list of people on the voice cast really helped the movie along quite nicely.And the references found in ""Rango"" to other movies was just great. If you are a movie aficionado, then you'll pick up a great deal of subtle and less-than-subtle hints and references through the entire movie.I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rango"" and was pleasantly surprised by it, because it surpassed my expectation to it by far. If you enjoy animated movies, then ""Rango"" is a definite must watch.",Rango
13,tavm,"Johnny Depp brings his charming voice, among others, to the computer animated Rango",8,7 April 2011,"In this computer animated feature, Johnny Depp voices a lizard who had previously been used to playacting in a waterball forced to walk the desert after the glass breaks when it fell off a moving vehicle. He then encounters a western town that seems to live in the 19th century...This was quite an amusing enterprise with many pointed pop-culture references like that of John Huston in Chinatown (represented by The Mayor as voiced by Ned Beatty) or Clint Eastwood's The Man with No Name (as voiced by Timonthy Olyphant). Oh, and there's also a compelling story with Rango becoming a reluctant hero and a Greek-chorus of guitar-playing birds that add to the fun. So on that note, Rango comes highly recommended.",Rango
14,michaelRokeefe,A pet chameleon becomes a wild west hero!,9,12 November 2014,"An absolute Grade A wacky, witty and weird animated feature directed by Gore Verbinski. And it doesn't hurt to have Johnny Depp voicing the lead character. A nameless pet chameleon(Depp) is jettisoned from a family's car on vacation and lands in the middle of a desert. He narrowly avoids being buzzard food when he is approached by another four legged creature walking upright, Beans(Isla Fischer). She eventually guides him to a desert town called Dirt. The thirsty stranger takes on the name Rango and goes from meek and mild to cocky and grandiose accepting the job of sheriff that carries the task of solving the mystery of the town's missing water supply.The animation is fabulous with not a stale moment to be found. Every cliché of western movies is touched and a lot of the humor may actually go above younger children's heads, but there are laughs a plenty to enjoy for everyone. Not exactly a clever story line, but still a hoot! The obligatory potty humor seems to be missing; but the music is cool and then there is the puzzle of figuring out what kind of creature each character is. The animation is fantastic and the voice work is top shelf. Depp's voice is spot on and gives Rango personality and depth.A few of the other stars lending voice to the characters: Ned Beatty, Harry Dean Stanton, Abigail Breslin, Bill Nighy, Stephen Root, Alfred Molina, Ray Winstone, James Ward Byrkit, Claudia Black and Timothy Olyphant.",Rango
15,grantss,Good fun,7,24 July 2016,"Rango is a chameleon. Literally. He is wandering through the desert, having escaped the clutches of a hawk, when he stumbles into the town of Dirt. After massively exaggerating his skills as a gunfighter, challenging the town hoodlum to a duel and (accidentally) killing the town's greatest menace, a large hawk, he is made Sheriff of the town. It is then that he discovers that the town has a massive water shortage. After chasing down some outsiders who robbed the bank, it appears the reason for the shortage may be due to intentional interference, and may be close to home.Good fun. Started pretty badly - plot was over the place and it appeared you needed to be high to enjoy it. However, from a point, around about the saloon scene, the movie finds focus and kicks up several notches. Ends having a decent plot (though a tad derivative of Chinatown), some good humour, great CGI and good action sequences.Vocal casting is spot-on, with Johnny Depp to the fore as Rango. All-star supporting cast delivers in spades.",Rango
16,Boba_Fett1138,Rango takes you on one unexpectedly great ride.,9,8 July 2011,"This movie perhaps already is one of the biggest surprises of the year. It's a way better and more entertaining movie that you at beforehand would expect and on top of that, it's great looking and really wonderfully and professionally put together by director Gore Verbinski.It was a real surprise when acclaimed director Gore Verbinski announced his next project to be an animated feature. He had never done animated movies before and besides that, he worked with a company that also hadn't made a full length computer animated movie before. It seemed like this movie was a real dream project for Verbinski and with his influence and reputation which he had build up with his movies over the years, he persuaded the studios to give him the budget and creative freedom.And because the movie got done by a director of 'normal' movies why ""Rango"" is different and original. It isn't as fluffy as lets say a Pixar movie and it certainly isn't as clean and smooth. ""Rango"" is raw and prefers making its characters look dirty and ugly. A true western in that sense and by saying things look dirty and ugly I of course don't mean to say that the animation is bad. On the contrary really!The animations are done by well known and acclaimed special effects company Industrial Light & Magic, or simply ILM. Ever since their early days they have been the pioneers of special effects and even till this date they are still at the top of their game. Yes, still better than Weta or any other special effects company, in my opinion. They had of course worked with all of the techniques before but this was the very first time for them to create a full length animated feature. All I can say is; I hope it won't be their last! Everything is incredible looking. The backgrounds, the details, the characters, the action. It makes you wonder were it all will lead up to one day. Is it really possible that in a decade or so we get to see movies, or at least CG sequences, that can't be distinguished from real ones? Leave it up to ILM to pull that off some day! Animation-wise I even prefer this movie over a Pixar one, though perhaps you shouldn't compare the two, since they serve a totally different audience.Fore ""Rango"" isn't necessarily a kid's movie. You could still really call it a family movie but it are probably the adults who will be mostly able to appreciate ""Rango"" for its visuals, humor, characters and references.What I really liked about this movie is that it features plenty of references to other movies, in- and outside of the western genre but it aren't the usual, standard visual gags or dialogs you would expect. It's way more clever and creative with those moments and as a movie lover I was really able to appreciate that, though I'm sure I haven't even catch all of the references yet with my first viewing.It's a true western and not only just that; it's also one of the best western to have come out in the last couple of years! Not bad for a movie starring a chameleon! It really has a western look and feel to it, as well as a great sense of adventure. It's a movie I really didn't want to end.The story is actually quite simple and also quite formulaic, once you start thinking about it. There actually really isn't anything special or original about the story but it's simply done all so superbly that the movie still works out as great and perfectly entertaining. The movie can even be divided into many different parts. It starts out as a sort of goofy one, which children will like but after that the comedy gets soon replaced with action and adventure and the comedy gets pushed more to the background. It doesn't make this the most consistent movie perhaps but while watching it you don't even notice it, so it just can't be a complaint in this case. The movie simply works out very well and you get sucked in immediately by all of it and the strange world of talking animals, who dress like humans and live in the human world. No, this really doesn't make sense but this really doesn't matter at all. You'll get especially sucked in by the movie its action sequences, which are all really amazing, as is Hans Zimmer's musical score, which suits the movie so very well and it should really earn him his second Oscar out of his career!It's a movie with plenty of big names attached to it with its voice cast but most of them are actually quite unrecognizable. Even Johnny Depp's voice, who plays the main lead, isn't always that recognizable. This is really not a complaint though. Most of the time, big names seem only to be attached to these sort of animated movie so that they have a big name, which they can put on the the posters and advertise their movie with. But with this movie the people really seem to have been cast because of their skills and how well they fit their characters. It really lets the actors work for their money, so to speak and they are really acting and playing a character, instead of just voicing an animated character.And the movie does has some real great characters in it, who are all also great looking ones, with each a very strong and distinctive, unusual look.This is such a fun and just brilliantly put together movie. It will be hard for any movie this year to top this one! The movie even features a great montage and fart joke in it. Two things lot's of other movies can't ever seem to get right!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rango
17,george.schmidt,Depp & Co. make a great animated 'western' come to fruition: One of the year's finest surprises and best films to boot.,10,22 March 2011,"RANGO (2011) **** (voices of: Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Bill Nighy, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Stephen Root, Harry Dean Stanton, Ray Winstone & Timothy Olyphant) Quick-witted ""Walter Mitty""-esque chameleon (Depp at his liveliest with a Kermit the Frog on acid affectation) winds up unwittingly lost in the desert town of Dirt, where he finds himself the self-appointed duties of the drought-plagued crittery citizenry faced with a corrupt tortoise mayor (Beatty channeling John Huston) and a gang of outlaws in the way. A splendid visual animated feast for the eyes (dig those earth-tones color schemes for the arid environs!) and aural sensation for the quick/sharp dialogue thanks to John Logan's screenplay collaboration with James Ward Byrkit and the inventive director GoreVorebinski (harkening back to classic Warner Bros' Looney Tunes echoing in the canyons). Some inspired riffing on cinema including a take of APOCALYPSE NOW's ""Flight of The Valkyries"" bat-attack; the storyline of ""CHINATOWN"" and the revelation of The Spirit of The West in the iconic form of Clint Eastwood's ""the Man-With-No-Name"" spaghetti westerns. The only genuine surprise is the film was not one of the myriad choices of 3-D as of late and while it surely doesn't need it, it feels like it was for its tactile artistry. One of the year's finest surprises and best films to boot.",Rango

19,ferguson-6,Let's Tango with Rango,8,6 March 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. I just can't believe it. Last year I was raving about Toy Story 3 being my favorite film of the year and now here I am again extolling the excellence of an animated feature. However, Rango is a different experience ... these are all new characters and a whole new look for animation. I would even say this is more a film for grown-ups than for kids, though kids will certainly get a kick out of Rango, a colorful chameleon energetically voiced by Johnny Depp.This story and film pays homage to many classic movies and especially to spaghetti westerns. You will easily spot the tributes to Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, Hunter S Thompson, Sergio Leone, Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood, High Noon, and of course Chinatown. The main story line is nearly identical to Chinatown ... the control of a town's water. Here we get the Mayor, voiced by Ned Beatty, in the John Huston role. For film fans, this is just so much fun! Rango the chameleon is a very likable character who just wants to be liked. He dreams of being a hero so that people will look up to him. Of course, he learns the hard way what being a hero really means. The town of Dirt, the desert, and multitude of characters are all fantastically drawn. There are times the film has a look of live action with terrific lighting and detail.The voice acting in the film is truly outstanding and it starts with Depp's fine work. Also contributing are Ned Beatty (Mayor), Bill Nighy (Rattlesnake Jake), Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Stephen Root, Alfred Molina (Armadillo), Ray Winstone, Charles Fleisher (from 1988 Roger Rabbit) and Timothy Olyphant as the Clint Eastwood character no-named Spirit of the West. There is also a useful and very funny Mariachi band that pops up periodically to push the story along.Director Gore Verbinski is known best for his Pirates of the Caribbean movies (with Depp) and he really gets to go all out on his visual style here. He is helped along by George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and their first foray into animation. Heads up Pixar ... you have definitely have some tough competition!",Rango
20,anaconda-40658,Bingo!,8,11 May 2015,"Rango (2011): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Voices: Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Ned Beatty, Bill Nighy: A send off to western classics with Johnny Depp voicing a chameleon named Rango, who is stranded in the desert. He happens upon a town called Dirt and as predictable formula goes, he puts on a charade as to who his true nature is. He sells himself as a sheriff who is to solve the town's water issues until he is driven out of town and exposed. Director Gore Verbinski peppers in as many film references as possible, however, the film's nature is too adult oriented for young children who may be drawn to the film's striking images. The animation is glorious detail of colours and shadows allowing it to resemble the films that inspired it. Depp voices Rango as a sense of his role in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. A slacker who is thrown into reality until faced with the truth and true heroism. This involves a showdown that climaxes with more intelligence than expected. Isla Fisher voices Beans, an iguana, romantic interest with a strong sense of facing enemies. Abigail Breslin voices Priscilla, an Aye-Aye or cactus mouse who is one of the town's smallest residence. Ned Beatty voices the leading villain, a tortoise that bears a striking resemblance to the mannerisms and speech of John Huston in Chinatown. Finally we have Bill Nighy voices the menacing Rattlesnake Jake, feared gunslinger and Rango's greatest adversary. This is all done with exquisite animated detail that rivals that of the best of the genre. Theme regards elevation to one's fullest potential and coming face to face with truth. Score: 8 / 10",Rango
21,zetes,"Great looking, decent story, but could stand to be funnier",7,6 March 2011,"Worth seeing mostly for the visuals. It's awesome how bizarre these characters are. I sincerely hope they frighten children (reports from the movie's message board say that there were a lot of young children weeping when the rattlesnake character appears). Animated films are often far too cutesy, and this is a breath of fresh air in that way. The story is not especially great, but it's passable. It's a Western about a pet chameleon (voiced (kind of poorly) by Johnny Depp) who gets lost in the Mojave and ends up in a small town. After some accidental heroics, he becomes sheriff. A local lizard girl (voiced (quite well) by Isla Fisher) persuades him to look into the current drought after she finds evidence of water being dumped in the middle of the desert. If that sounds familiar, it's because that whole mystery plot is cribbed from Chinatown. That doesn't bother me at all, and the mystery is relatively complex for a kid's movie. My major complaint about Rango is that the humor very rarely works. The script is just not very funny. If it wasn't supposed to be, that would be fine, but they're clearly going for laughs (and failing).",Rango
22,deloudelouvain,Oscar well deserved.,8,26 April 2019,"The Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year went to Rango and to be honest in this category it clearly deserves that. After The Ring and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Gore Verbinski brings us another highly entertaining movie, this time with something slightly different as it is an animated movie. The images and characters are just perfect, it's all very creative and visually stunning. As for the actors, or better the voice-overs, they were perfect in their roles. I can't see anybody narrating Rango better than Johnny Depp. The story is simple but effective, with alot of humor, maybe not for the younger kids but more for adults with a healthy imagination and that don't mind watching animation movies every now and then. Rango, a movie I will watch again in the future.",Rango
23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Rango,10,11 March 2011,"This is the story of a humble chameleon that is destined for greater things, being put on his true calling by a freak accident that got him literally thrown out the window of his comfort zone, and into the big bad real world, the canvas in which he will bungle and stumble into recognition. Director Gore Verbinski is probably well known in recent years for this Pirates of the Caribbean action adventure trilogy, and he brings that swashbuckling sense of storytelling into the animated realm with Industrial Light and Magic's maiden venture into a full length animated feature film.But to offer up some guarantees chartering into unknown waters, Verbinski brings onboard some of his pirates alumni to provide that A-list voice cast for animated characters that don't look at all a tad adorable - imagine selling a rattlesnake or a chameleon as a soft toy - providing that additional oomph that this is no run of the mill venture to test waters, but a serious attempt at great storytelling with great visuals, and its Western movie homage fires on all cylinders to bring about a rip roaring comical adventure that's suited more for the young adult and upwards demographics.There's Johnny Depp playing the titular character, a motormouth who daydreams of being a somebody, and finds that in this strange new world with the town called Dirt that he discovers in the middle of the Mojave Desert, comes an opportunity to live out his dreams of a badass with a reputation of ridding his opponents with just one bullet off his sixshooter. The townsfolks lap up all his stories when Rango accidentally finishes off one of the town's greatest predators, and got rewarded with being the new Sheriff in town. While he knows he's a complete fluke, that doesn't stop Rango from living up the attention, with deadlier foes all coming in the horizon given the food chain concept of there always being another predator just around the corner, especially with the absence of something higher up.But for those expecting a simple tale of Rango overcoming such obstacles in his path in his road to enlightenment, you'll find that expectation soundly busted with the same sense of complexity that Verbinski brings to the Pirates films, where the plot here tangents off in all possible intertwining angles, where the villains are more political and the problems faced by the town of Dirt being more macro than micro and quite contemporary too with the reminder on the scarcity of fresh water that our real world at large face, calling for attention to be paid to the plot crafted by John Logan, Gore Verbinski and James Ward Byrkit, that rewards at the end when they converge.Fans of Western films will undoubtedly identify with the myriad of homage paying moments in Rango, culminating in the appearance of the Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant), who without a doubt resembled one of the greatest Western characters played by Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone films. I thought it would be a treat if Eastwood had lent his voice, but it was not to be. Still, the voice acting of the likes of Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty and Ray Winstone are nothing to scoff about.The animation is top notch and will give Pixar, Disney and those ahead in the game a firm run for the money. You'll feel the heat and parched landscapes of the desert, coupled with texture rich creatures created. Rango also struck a fine balance between dramatic, dialogue heavy moments with its kinetic big set action sequences, and Verbinski once again underscores his brilliance in creating a large action adventure, with one of my favourites here being the aerial and land battles midway through the film with Rango and his ragtag gang running away from adversaries who utilizes the flight of the bats as an aerial threat. Really edge of your seat, exciting stuff conjured.For those who have enough of animation dwelling on the cutesy nature pandering to the younger audiences and with that ulterior motive to sell toys, Rango will be that breath of fresh air to reinforce the notion that animation can be for adults to enjoy as well, if rightly done with the right ingredients used to tell a good story with great, zany comedy to top it all off. Highly recommended, and this strikes early gold into my shortlist of one of the best films thus far this year.",Rango

And true animation and big screen cartoons aren't my favorite type of films still every now and then these type of pictures are worth a watch. ""Rango"" tells a wild west story of good against evil the up and coming lawman and the bad mayor with cowboys and it has a theme pattern of ""High Noon"" and ""True Grit"" only it's done in animation! Yet it has the stars in it they just look different as characters in the wild west town of dirt. Johnny Depp is just fine and the beauty Isla Fisher plays a damsel in distress she even has a scene where she's tied up and gagged!

26,KineticSeoul,"The CGI animation is solid and truly fantastic, everything else was just okay",7,5 March 2011,"After seeing the first trailer of this cgi animated movie, I didn't really have a big hype for it nor did I know what the movie is about. After watching it, I can safely say it really did not meet my expectations. Now I know what style and direction it was trying to go but overall it just wasn't all that effective. The movie also seems to be all over the place sometimes and not in a good way either. There just wasn't the development to care what goes on all that much, I just didn't care for any of the characters in this movie and what happens to them. And like I said I didn't know much about this movie and didn't expect it to be a wacky CGI animated western or a semi-western movie for kids and adults. I will say the movie did have it's moments although I never heard the word ""water"" so many times in a movie before. And the CGI animation is spectacular and amazing to watch, the quality of the CGI animation really is top notch in this. The voice actors did a really good job as well, didn't expect much from Johnny Depp in this but he pulled it off really well. Bill Nighy did a good job as Rattlesnake Jake the antagonist as well and really stood out. Overall the animation is solid and very detailed, it was truly amazing to see the CGI animation on the big screen but as for the direction and story. I could tell what what it was trying to do but wasn't fully effective. Maybe if the movie was a bit more witty at least I would have given it a higher rating.7.5/10",Rango
27,sddavis63,It's Fun For All Ages,7,1 January 2012,"Rare is the animated feature that will be of appeal to ages 6 to 96, but ""Rango"" seems to have accomplished that balance rather nicely. Kudos to all who were involved with this production, but especially to the animators. The animation in this was absolutely brilliant. While it's obvious that walking and talking animals are animated, the details of the Town of Dirt and the desert landscape take on a definite sense of reality. In those scenes where there are no characters on screen it would be very easy to forget that this is in fact an animated feature.The story has something for everyone. Basically, this is a Western in animated form. Rango is a pet chameleon who as a result of a car accident gets separated from his family on a highway in the middle of the desert. Being a domestic animal, he has no idea what to do or how to survive until a helpful armadillo tells him the direction to a nearby town where he should be able to get water. Stumbling across the desert, he finally comes across the small Town of Dirt, populated entirely by animals of various sorts. Struggling to fit in, he spins a few yarns about himself and his adventures and where he came from, and he ends up quite accidentally as a local hero and as the local sheriff who suddenly has to confront the town's great mystery - the water supply is quickly disappearing.The details of the story are really oriented far more toward adults than children, and those who let children watch this should know going in that there's some mildly harsh language and a few scenes that might be frightening for little ones. But they'll enjoy the animation. Kids love animated animals - and all ages will enjoy some of the action sequences in the movie, which - like the rest of the animation - is very well done, and quite believable.I thought this weakened perhaps a bit in the last half hour or so. At that point (really, with the introduction of Jake the Rattlesnake, who was as the rest very well animated, but who was also a rather menacing character) a lot of the fun of the movie disappeared, and it actually became a rather heavy story toward the end. The ultimate moral of the story is that Rango has to find himself and be himself. In the end, once the reason for the disappearing water supply becomes obvious, there's also a bit of an environmental message, but it wasn't preachy at all, and for the most part it was very entertaining.

28,Hellmant,Definitely a kids film at heart and a good one at that.,8,3 April 2011,"'RANGO': Four Stars (Out of Five) Industrial Light & Magic's first animated feature film and it's a beauty. I think it's the best looking animated film to date, the CGI animation is breathtaking! The film also marks the re-teaming of director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp (after making three 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' films together). In the film Depp voices a chameleon who falls out of his owners' car and becomes lost in the Mojave Desert. He then finds a town of assorted animals living out in the Wild West in need of a sheriff. The film is written by John Logan, James Ward Byrkit and Verbinski. It's a pretty dark and somewhat mature animated film that some have argued is not a kids film. I think while it does have plenty of appeal for adults as well it's still a kids film at heart and a very good one at that.The film's title character is in fact a chameleon named Lars. Lars had always dreamed of adventure outside of the terrarium where he lives and when it falls off his owners' car on the highway he's forced into one. He first meets an armadillo named Roadkill (Alfred Molina) with mysterious healing abilities and tales of a 'Spirit of the West'. Roadkill encourages Lars to venture out into the desert so Lars does and is almost eaten by a hawk. He then finds the town of Dirt and lies to the locals telling them of adventurous duels he's been in. He also tells them his name is Rango. After he kills the deadly hawk with luck the town looks up to him and makes him their sheriff. He's then tasked with the responsibility of solving the town's water shortage, which is like gold to the animals living in the desert.The film, like I said, is very dark and filled with ugly looking characters, mature jokes and references as well as a fair amount of violence. It also has plenty of kids humor as well though and a heart and uplifting message too. A good kids film should appeal to adults as well and this one definitely does. It's got elements of western, comedy and a little spiritual drama (it's very psychedelic at times which is fitting for a Johnny Depp film). The movie doesn't talk down to kids and most of the jokes are not too cheesy or silly (although there are a few). It's a little slow in places but never for too long. The animation like I said is the best I've ever seen in a feature length animated film and the movie as a whole rivals the best of Pixar and DreamWorks. It's not the best animated film I've ever seen but it's definitely among them.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk",Rango

At any rate, 'Rango' relishes in homage to the past Westerns – though it's not technically a Western (too much of a spoiler on why not) – and even then, it's story is really, really old. That said, visually, it's stunning, its attention to detail is that of Pixar-quality, it's hilarious at times and a recommendation for all despite it's too-long running time. Oh, and in spite of the fact it voices one of my all time favorite actors, Timothy Olyphant, they really should've got the real-deal in that great scene. It's a SEE IT. 4/5 Stars.",Rango
30,cherold,A peyote dream masquerading as a kid's movie,8,24 June 2012,"For the first five minutes, I was worried that Rango was going to be some innocuous kids movie about a lonely lizard. And then, in a crazy moment of shattered glass and slow motion spilling water, Rango revealed itself as a movie of stunning animation and a willingness to get kinda weird. Ten minutes later, it showed itself as a movie that was willing to get really, really weird.While the whole animated cartoon characters would seem to make this a kid's movie, such things as evil looking trees and a quick shot of Hunter S. Thompson tell a different tale. The movie is bizarre and trippy.It is also fast-paced, stylish and at times quite funny, although it's not the funniest of animated features and is really more memorable for some of the best animation I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie and a huge cast of bizarre and creepy characters.Is this a kid's movie? Well, it's dark and twisted and very strange, but then, so is Alice in Wonderland. While adults often forget this, kids are dark, twisted individuals. But since I don't have any, I won't say whether it's a good movie to take kids to. But it's a great movie to take yourself to.",Rango
31,ElMaruecan82,Rango is a Bingo...,10,14 October 2016,"Ever since my eyes met the poster of ""Rango"", this film never stopped to tickle my curiosity. I made a poll about scariest looking not-meant-to-be-scary posters and ""Rango"" seemed like a good candidate, but it made me wonder: how on Earth could such an ugly-looking creature be ever conceived as a major animated protagonist? Rango is not 'Shrek ugly', Shrek is monstrous in a cinematically appealing way, but Rango looks like a chameleon and I don't think these animals would make it in the Top 20 bestial beauty pageants, even by Disney standards, a chameleon IS ugly.But then again, why shouldn't a chameleon be the hero? Why should the requirements of drawings affect the narrative status, and as a matter of fact, what it is with the whole reptilian universe's snubbing, aren't we tired of cute, fluffy bunnies and proud and majestic horses? One of the good things about ""Rango"", and there are plenty, is that the film redeems a whole fauna that has been severely overlooked by animation: the creatures from the desert. The setting is a town named Dirt and its populated by the flotsam and jetsam of bestial society: toads, rats, lizards, bats, turtles and beavers, even the rodents are drawn in the ugliest possible way, but these are the animals who fought the hard way for survival, centuries and centuries of evolution, but in ""human timing"", it fits the Conquest of the West period. And what better a setting than the desert for a great Western story?And if ""Rango"" is all built on Western archetypes and some from other genres (and that includes one of the best takes on ""Apocalypse Now"") these references aren't the end but only the means, it's all in the story. And this is why I'm glad I finally watched ""Rango"" because I never really put my finger in what left me perplex in ""A Shark Tale"", and now I got it, it's one thing to make references to countless movies and the more of a movie lover you are, the more likely to enjoy them you are but here, no reference feels gratuitous and it's always combined with a bit of originality that belongs to the film. ""Rango"" has a story to tell, it takes it seriously enough to get pretty dark and handle such serious themes like death, thirst and progress and it knows how to loosen up when needed to. In other words, it's adult material; I doubt the film would appeal to little children, but this is finally a movie that aims the adult world in an intelligent and fun.Starting with Rango, that little guy is one of these original creations that immediately grow in you, a chameleon who is a hero in his own world, he rehearses it with a headless naked Barbie doll, a dead cockroach and a mechanical fish but the heart isn't in it, he know what lacks: conflict, a pivotal moment, a journey starter. Basically, Rango anticipates his heroic status, he's like the voice of his own writers, his voice-actor, Johnny Depp and his ""Caribbean Pirates"" director Gore Verbinski. He is an obvious creation, and the presence of the singing owls as a Greek chorus reinforced the artificiality of Rango. But when the action takes off, when an armadillo crosses the road, and the tank where Rango lived get out of his owners' speeding car, Rango is thrown on the road, gets out of the comfort zone but gets 'in the picture' and becomes his own creation, the journey begins and things start to get fun.The armadillo shows him the way where he can meet his destiny, the West so Rango moves forward, he meets a hawk, a toad, a bottle of coke and finally, a cute female lizard named Beans, whose particularity is to freeze like a defensive move. But she's more than the soon-to-be love interest. The film plays with archetypes but never without substance. Take the great saloon entrance, Rango is eager to make an impression, he then brags about how he killed seven outlaws with one bullet while everyone listens with admiration, he is hilarious not just by the speech he makes but the enthusiasm form his listeners. Every character in this film has something to say, in most animated films, you have the protagonists and the rest are just space fillers with occasional one-liners, in ""Rango"", you feel like each one's story would have made as good a film.So ""Rango"" becomes the sheriff, and the plot gets more surprisingly thicker and complex with a scheme you wouldn't see coming, let's just say that it involves water and the antagonist is obviously based on Noah Cross from ""Chinatown"". Out of all the movies parodied in animated features, this is the last I would have expected, and when the Mayor says that he uses water to buy 'the future', I didn't even think of Chinatown, I was drawn out by the film, and I was wondering why is it that Tarantino gets screenplays nominations for a thing like ""Django Unchaines"" and a film like ""Rango"" gets none. Well, it still won the Best Animated Feature Oscar and rightfully so.But I wonder if it would have won over the 2010 Disney films or in 2012, this is obviously a film that is 100% original which is more than you can say about Disney and Dreamworks, and it's a film that stands so high above the usual movies for kiddies that it deserves a special spot as the most original cartoon and the riskiest. Indeed, you can't even merchandise ""Rango"", and that's why I love about it, it's a film whose priority was to have a unique look and feel. In the end, it is a unique film.",Rango
32,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Rango unchained.,8,9 March 2021,"For starters, 'Rango (2011)' just looks gorgeous; it's an odd yet successful mix of outlandish, exaggerated character designs and earthy, almost photoreal rendering. It has a unique vibe all of its own, though it obviously also pays homage to the western genre. It's actually strangely spiritual in a way, with a musical score that's as often introspective as it is bombastic and resonant themes of self-discovery, finding companionship and delivering deeds not words. Of course, the movie is also straightforwardly fun, with plenty of fast-paced action set-pieces and slyly tongue-in-cheek dialogue exchanges. It's really funny, too; there are several belly-laughs throughout. When it comes down to it, the piece is just incredibly well-made and equally as enjoyable. It really is a blast, as impressive as it is entertaining. It's great. 8/10",Rango
33,g-bodyl,Beautiful Animation!,9,29 January 2013,"The beautifully-animated Rango is one of the best animation films of 2011. I'm glad it won Best Animated Feature at the Oscars because it clearly deserved it. This is like one of those 1960's spaghetti westerns but this film is even better than those. I liked the fact on how many movies this film paid homage to. It is just worth the admission price to see the gleefully awesome ways on how this movie paid homage.Gore Verbinski's film is about a household chameleon stumbles across a town in the desert that is lacking in water. With inventive stories, Rango makes a name for himself and becomes an instant success and a hero. But, sooner or later, he is going to have to prove himself.This film has such a great voice cast. I'm not surprised with the Johnny Depp casting because he seems to be in every Verbinski film but Depp does the role just right. I liked the great supporting cast of Ned Beatty, Ray Winstone, Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, and many more.Overall, this is a smart, well-made animated film that ranks high in my favorite animations of all time list. This film is funny, witty, and has a great message. I liked the scenes which featured the narrating, musical birds. They were so depressing, but in a good and funny way. This is also an example of a western film done right despite the animation. I rate this film 9/10.",Rango

35,ironhorse_iv,This isn't your average animated movie! Go Rango Go!,8,28 April 2013,"Director Gore Verbinski once again teams up with his main star from Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) Johnny Depp, this time on his Animation Feature 'Rango'. Rango isn't your average animated film. It's nearly borderlines being an adult film with several mature themes that may go over kids' head. There is a lot of cursing, plenty of violence & killing, drinking and smoking. Somewhat racist jokes about the natives. So there is a lot that not for younger viewers. There are also positive messages about living up to your potential, defending those who are defenseless, and the importance of authority figures who do what's in their community's best interest instead of their own. The movie stars a lonely pet chameleon (Johnny Depp) seeking adventure suffering from an identity crisis whom becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert after his glass world crashed around him. While wandering the desert, he meets a desert iguana name Beans (Isla Fisher), a rancher's daughter, who takes him to Dirt, an Old West town populated by desert animals. Using swagger and creativeness to fit in, the chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named Rango. Sooner than later, the town mayor (Ned Beatty) ask Rango to become its sheriff, to help solve the drought crisis. What Rango finds is more complex than it seems. Now if you really want to make a comparison to other movies, watch Chinatown by Roman Polanski (1974). You'll see the similarities jump out at you, down to water being the pivotal part of the plot. The mayor may as well also be lifted directly from that movie. It's seems like Rango had some very interesting movie influences to its production. Not only Chinatown, but the name 'Rango' is similar to the name Francis Nero's 'Django' (1966). Other influences are Sergio Leone's The Dollars Trilogy like supporting characters such as Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) that looks and acts like Lee Van Cleef from the Good, Bad, and the Ugly (1966). I really loved Rattlesnake Jake. He had quite a bit of build-up, and when he appears. He was very intimidating. How many of you shivered when you saw him? But at the same time, he had a strong code of honor that I feel really sets it apart from other villains in animated films today. The Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant) was interesting, in the fact that looks like Clint Eastwood and sounds like him. My favorite movie influence was the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) references. Love the Hunter S. Thompson cameo. It was pretty trippy. The visuals outdo anything Pixar has done so far, and trust me I'm a big fan of Pixar. This movie is the first animated feature produced by Industrial Light & Magic, the special effects company that George Lucas create for Star Wars (1977) hints why you can see their logos in Easter eggs form. It's amazingly detailed. The CGI was breath taking, such examples are the way the light shines on the animal skins, the landscape, how the dirt was all over their clothes. Great voice cast from everybody, and a lot of funny moments. The humor is a hit or miss, for me. There were a few jokes that did fall flat on their faces, but for the most part, I thought it was just hilarious. I thought it was a nice blend of dark humor and drama, especially for a kid's flick. Sometimes, there are these moments when I wish for a Mariachi-band to follow my every step and accompany it with their music. The music by Hans Zimmer was awesome. Welcome Amigo by Rick Garcia and 'We ride' by Hans Zimmer are my favorites. Here is some of the faults of the film. The basically revolves around death, so it can be a bit, depressing. It's true, they were building up to a death. They said in the beginning, ""We're here to celebrate the life and untimely death of a hero."" In the end, you find out, something that isn't right with that statement. Still overall, would gladly pay to see this movie again.

In the process he would become the most unlikely of heroes.I must be honest I didn't find the first few minutes very funny, or all that interesting for that matter. It was cute in places, but also bland in others. However, around the midway mark, it became very exciting and quite thrilling, actually, with lots of action and fast-paced sequences.

42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Existential yet goofy, ""Rango"" will impress both young and old",8,4 March 2011,"We all face an existential crisis at some time or another, just usually not when we're seven, which will likely be the mean age of children watching this newest non-Pixar non- DreamWorks animated feature. No, ""Rango"" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself — as many animals in animated films do these days — thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. But in addition to all its verboseness and abstract homage to classic Westerns, ""Rango"" equally dishes out top-notch physical humor and creative characters for the young ones to lap up, even if they're not exactly of age to, as the film puts at least once, ""ruminate.""We don't learn much about Rango's life as a pet lizard. In fact, his name is not even Rango; he adopts it as his identity during his adventure. We do see him create his own theatre productions with the random items in his tank and he pretends that they give him feedback and criticism. When he determines that his latest show needs some intense conflict, he finds himself flung from his tank and on the side of the dry desert road. At the advice of an old armadillo (Molina), he seeks out water and stumbles upon the town of Dirt, a classic Wild West locale full or critters and experiencing a nasty drought.Johnny Depp quickly loses himself into Rango, a character that's somewhere between his take on Willy Wonka and his turn as Hunter S. Thompson. Depp churns out an outstanding animated protagonist, one who is equal parts boisterous and insecure. As the ultimate outsider in Dirt, our lizard hero has an epiphany: he can reinvent himself out here. He takes up his new name and makes up a fantastical tall tale and then with a pinch of luck, becomes the toast of the town and gets anointed sheriff. All seems swell, but something's up in the town with regards to the dwindling water supply and the local critters are getting restless. Rango must truly be the hero he masquerades as.The creatures of Dirt are fascinatingly animated. They are gritty and unpleasant looking, but awing in their detail. Rango's facial expressions even out-Depp the man behind them as embodied in the scrawny asymmetrical lizard. The animators do a particularly fine job of creating the hot and dry climate of the desert, enough so to recommend that the film is best enjoyed with a beverage in hand. It's so effective that it magnifies the problematic nature of this simple predicament done hundreds of times before. Hidden underneath it all somewhere has to be an environmental message, but not an overt one and not the main lesson to learn from the story.The language and texture of the film might be decidedly adult, but the conventions of the story and the degree of action aims specifically for children. Rather than aim for a middle ground, ""Rango"" somehow takes the highest road and the lowest road simultaneously. The dialogue and the situations are sophisticated but the physicality of the characters and the high-flying Western frontier action still plays to a child's understanding. This only proves that ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Gore Verbinski has a real gift for all-ages entertainment.In addition to Rango's existential quandary, children will not understand the cinematic homages either, particularly to spaghetti Westerns. One of the film's most affecting scenes comes at the moment when our animated hero, as they all do, hits the lowest of lows after he's exposed as a ""fraud."" Rango has a run-in with ""The Spirit of the West,"" an instantly recognizable figure who has some old-fashioned advice about toughness and walking tall on the path you're given. It's a tender moment as what has been considered a bygone era of cinema plays an important thematic role in such a modern mainstream story.""Rango"" doesn't quite capture the degree of humor and emotional depth that the Pixar greats of the last few years have, but it's a fun adventure with exquisite animation, tasteful characters and a good heart, which puts it as an above-average offering compared to others of its kind. Adults will simply marvel at the intellectual boldness of this pure and simple kids movie and rightfully so. Only with a Pixar gold standard in place does ""Rango"" come across as flawed; otherwise it's an absolutely pleasant watch from start to finish.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Rango
43,Vartiainen,Odd duck of an animation,7,9 September 2021,"An Academy Award winning movie from Nickelodeon Movies of all studios. Who would have thought?Nevertheless, it did happen. And the movie honestly ain't half bad. It follows the eponymous Rango, voiced by Johnny Depp, a small chameleon who gets lost in the desert and becomes the unlikely sheriff of a small frontier town populated by other critters.The plot itself is quite honestly more than a little clichéd. You can very easily predict each story beat several minutes in advance. But sometimes that's not a bad thing. Would I have preferred a bit more original storyline? Sure, but I'm happy with what I got because it was told so well. Depp is a surprisingly good comedic voice actor, the film honestly looks gorgeous, the jokes are funny and I like the world they have built for the film.But really, movie. You're going to introduce a character named The Spirit of the West? And not have him be voiced by Clint Eastwood? What's wrong with you!Plus those cursed owls. I was promised things! And they never delivered. Unforgivable!Ahem.Aside from those two gripes, the film was a lot of fun.",Rango
44,lisafordeay,Am I the only person here who actually didn't like this movie,3,14 September 2014,"So it was on TV last night on RTE ONE as the Big Big Movie and since I am a lover for animated movies(which are too many to put down here on this review)I decided to give this one a go. Turns out that this film is too overrated and shouldn't have won an Oscar back in 2012. I dunno maybe I'm not a Johnny Depp fan as I find him creepy in A lot of his movies,but anyway here is the review.The movie tells the tale of Rango(voiced by Johnny Depp who in fairness did a good job as the voice of him) a pet chameleon who ends up getting lost in the town of Dirt,as he gets thrown out of his owners car by mistake and meets an animal in the side of the road. Of course Rango follows the animal to a western town where Rango meets a girl (voiced by Isla Fisher from Confessions of a Shopaholic)and Rango ends up saving the town from drought.I didn't get to see the ending of this movie as I just didn't like it. I dunno why I mean the animation was great(if not too creepy for younger kids),there is A lot of adult humor in it(heck Shrek had adult humor too). But you have to be a big fan of Johnny Depp which sadly I'm not at all and you have to be interested in westerns.My advice watch Frozen,Tangled,How To Train Your Dragon or any other good CGI or hand-drawn movie instead of this one. Its too overrated like I said and they should have given it to another animated film at the 2012 Oscars.Im giving it a 3/10,because I like the animation.",Rango
45,freemantle_uk,A solid animated film,7,5 June 2012,"From the back of three Pirates of the Caribbean films, Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp reunited to work together, working on Verbinski's first animated film, a film which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Film.An unnamed and lonely pet chameleon with a lot of acting (Depp) ends up strained in the middle of the desert after a car accident. Desperate for water the chameleon ends up in a western town called Dirt which in the middle of a water crisis and in the local saloon comes up with a new identity as the gunslinger Rango. After Rango accidentally kills a hawk he is celebrated as a hero and becomes the main of the town and is quickly put on the case to find out what is happening to the town's water.Rango is a wonderfully animated film, with a great amount of detail and was able to get a balance between realism and cartoonary, Rango being the most cartoonary looking creature. Because of the animation Verbinski is able to give the film an move the camera to unique places, do incredible shots and make some good action sequences, the scene with the bandits on bats whilst Ride of the Valkryie was an incredible action scene.There is a great voice cast, Depp was unrecognisable as the lead character, someone who suffers an existential crisis, trying to come up with an identity for himself in the world. He was obviously have a lot of fun in the role and Verbinski inhabits the cast with a lot of people Depp could work. Isla Fisher is a strong as the love interest and strong western world woman, who has a fun running gag that she freezes up as defence mechanism, but she does turn into a dismal in distress. Abigail Breslin too has good comic timing as a child character with a dark scene of humour. There are great supporting acting like Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Ray Winstone and Timothy Olyphant, who are solid through and provide some more serious characters in the film.But is most weird about the film is humour which is dark and morbid. There are some moments that are just out of place, like in the beginning with Road Kill (Molina) who is pretty much sliced in half, a bit dark for a family film and most of the jokes have a dark/adult tone. They are jokes geared to adults like Thespian one but then there are some toilet and fart jokes which felt out of place. There is a chorus of owl who did provide a lot of humour, but there was one fourth wall joke I did like when Rango gets them play for a montage, with one of them even playing an electric guitar: its hardly a deal breaker but it annoyed me. There were moments I laughed heavily like when Rango gave his gun to a child and when Rango punches a woman, and other moments I did smile at.Rango is entertaining and enjoying with some great animation and action. But I personally thought Kung Fu Panda 2 was a better animated 2011 film for the whole family.3.5/5.",Rango
46,kevin_robbins,This is a very good movie that is a bit underrated and a fun family film,8,16 October 2021,"Rango (2011) is a movie I recently rewatched with my daughter on Netflix. The storyline for this picture follows an escaped lizard from his safe family to the wild desert. He wanders into a town filled with local lizards that are struggling to find water. Rango talks himself up as a big tough lizard despite not being so and talks himself into becoming sheriff. Shortly after doing so he sets out to release the water and save the town. This movie is directed by Gore Verbinski (Pirate of the Caribbean) and includes voices by Johnny Depp (Blow), Isla Fisher (Wedding Crashers), Timothy Olyphant (The Crazies), Ned Beatty (The Deliverance), Alfred Molina (Boogie Nights) and Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean). The animation in this is absolutely outstanding. The setting are unique and a perfect place to lose your imagination and enjoy the diverse group of characters and animals. The dialogue is hilarious and well written and the movie also contains great sound effects. The story is fun and contains good twists and turns. The action scenes are also excellent and well done. Overall this is a very good movie that is a bit underrated and a fun family film. I'd score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",Rango
47,dfranzen70,Depp once again proves his range,9,10 March 2012,"Rango is more than just a pleasant, well-conceived kids' film. I'm not even sure kids are the target audience. There really aren't any adorable animals afoot, although there is an obvious Bad Guy and a whimsical Good Guy. But there's a level of delightful sophistication that makes Rango a cut above most of its ilk - and, as a prize, it picked up the Best Animated Feature Oscar, so there's that.Rango (Johnny Depp) is a chameleon. Well, truthfully, we don't know what his name is; he merely adopts the name when he has to. See, our chameleon is really a family pet who finds himself stranded in the middle of the desert, alone for the first time. He wanders into an aptly named town called Dirt, a place that is naturally beset by bad'uns despite a paternal mayor (Ned Beatty). Our friendly chameleon, who has spent his life in a terrarium wishing he could star in a musical (seriously!) finds his acting prowess put to the test. Yes, he must become Rango, the daring gunslinger who has saved other towns in the Old West. It seems Dirt has a problem: little water. I know, if they had water they'd be Mud, right? True, true, but the critters who inhabit the town still need water, apparently, to farm and, you know, exist. Such denizens include lizards, iguanas, moles, mice, armadillos, rabbits, Gila monsters, and tortoises. You know, desert critters. Anyway, the town actually has a bank - a bank in which water resides. Citizens make deposits, withdrawals, and you get the idea. But the supply is running precariously low. Why is that?Rango to the rescue! I won't bore you with how exactly our chameleon susses out the situation, but let's say he takes the bull by the horns, suffers some indignities, proves he's not what he says he is, and maybe wins in the end. After all, it's an animated film that kids are going to be interested in, so don't expect a lot of violence or a detailed plot. It's not important.What is important, and what truly makes this a wonderful film, is Depp. If I didn't know any better - and I don't, really - I would swear he was ad-libbing all of his lines. Depp's patter is rapid, intelligent, witty, and delightful. Often, if an actor improvises and isn't up to it, you'll darn well notice - none of the made-up lines connect with each other or the rest of the movie, jokes fall flat. Hey, actors aren't usually writers as well. But if he or she is good at improv, then you get lines that seem even more natural than the scripted variety. For the record, John Logan wrote the screenplay, and since he was nominated this year for writing Martin Scorsese's Hugo, I think we can assume that the words we hear Depp speak are indeed from the pen of Mr. Logan. Most of them, anyway.Good supporting cast, too, including a creepy, oily turn by Bill Nighy as a rattlesnake; Beatty as the tortoise-mayor (who might remind one of Noah Cross in Chinatown); Isla Fisher as Beans, the nominal love interest who has catatonia as a defense mechanism; and Alfred Molina as a run-over 'dillo. Directing the shenanigans (his first animated feature) is Gore Verbinski, who directed Depp in three Pirates of the Caribbean movies.Kids will like this movie, although maybe those who are fans of shoot- em-up cartoons will take a greater shine to it than those who like love stories, but we're not going to stereotype here. Truth is, Beans is one of the toughest characters in the movie, much more so than poor Rango. In any event, Rango contains some scenes that may frighten small children (scenes involving the rattlesnake Jake, for example), but much more action and comedy than anything else, and even for jaded moviegoers it's a lot of fun to watch.",Rango
48,meeza,"Plenty of boring dirt in Rango, but overall Depp's delight and the classic movies homage makes it a marginal recommendation!",7,5 March 2011,"""Rango Rango Man, I have to see that Rangoman"" I said to myself several times in anticipation of the next Johnny Depp starring vehicle ""Rango"". The trailers of this computer-animated movie looked enticing. Come on, Johnny Depp voicing a bug-eyed, fast-talking lizard! How could it miss? But after seeing ""Rango"", I must say that I am a bit disappointed. ""Rango"" does delight in playing homage to classic movies such as ""Apocalypse Now"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and the infamous ""man with no name"" Eastwood westerns. But what ""Rango"" dangles primarily on is on its dull narrative. Our protagonist Rango is a lizard drifter (aren't we all?,whatever that means) who ends up in the animal western-town of Dirt. The Mayor of Dirt (voiced by Ned Beatty) does plenty of dirty deeds done first cheap by stealing the town's water for greedy investment purposes; or something like that. That watered-down plot line did stray my attention; it's not like I was watching ""Chinatown"". Rango falls for Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher), a ""looks like a lizard but I cannot make what it is"" Dirt animal female who is suspicious of the Mayor's actions and wants to keep the land of her deceased father. Rango, with his wit and fast-talk, ends up convincing most of the town animal residents of Dirt that he is a skilled killer & fighter. The Dirt animals love Rango, he is to them one rocking Rango Star! Rango is then appointed Sheriff and his first sherrify task at hand is to save the Dirt town from being waterless due to their droughtarama. Predictability then ensues as Rango gets into hot water when his Dirt followers found out that he has been deceiving them all this time. Writer John Logan must have not gone into a profuse analytical Logan's writing run with Rango's formulaic script; and to make it worse he even included way too much dialogue incomprehensible for children; who let's face it, is the major demographic target audience of ""Rango"" . It appeared to me that Director Gore Verbinski was trying too hard to guide the film with unorthodox elements. Gore, this is not ""The Lizards of the Non-Caribbean: The Curse of the Amphibian World""! However, what rang in quietly nicely in ""Rango"" was the stellar talent of Johnny Depp as ""Rango"". I could not envision any other actor but Depp giving ""Rango"" his character justice. ""Rango"" is a lizard tale that lounges around most of the time, but is salvaged by Depp and that classic movies' homage. *** Average",Rango

Johnny Depp brings what he does to every picture these days - an inimitable lust for life and boatloads of free-wheeling character - but the film doesn't make much effort to move beyond its status as a playground for his zealous voice work. Rango's plot is very by-the-books, and despite several amusing nods and winks to other pictures along the way, is never quite able to shake that burr loose from the heel of its boot. For a PG kids' picture, it also pushes the envelope in several spots with an armful of violence and a dozen jokes that will sail right over a younger audience's head. Didn't really bother me, personally, but it's not something I'll be pulling out for the rugrats until they're a bit older.

50,XweAponX,This is the Proper Use of George Lucas' ILM,10,28 February 2012,"As much as I loathed the Star Wars I-III Fiascos, because of overbloated CGI and No Substance, I LOVE this moovie for the same reason. Not because of ""No Substance"" - There IS substance here. There is a Cleverly Written by John Logan story which was fleshed out by some very good Computer animators - Possibly the same ones that worked on SW: Episodes I-III except that their services were good and proper HERE. The characters were brought to life by incredible Voice Talents: Johnny Depp, Abigail Breslin, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty - Alfred Molina - and the great Bill Nighy - And many many more.This movie works like Warner Brothers cartoons from the 30's through the 60's worked. It works cos it is a nod to Directors like Chuck Jones and I Freleng. Early Hanna-Barbera (Not Later H-B). Walter Lantz. it is a nod to over 70 years of Cartoon Cleverness.THIS kind of movie is what the CGI is for-It's an artistic Medium. Meaning, Gore Verbinski used it as a Palette and Paint Brush.Because, it does not pander to little Kids. Movies (Star Wars I-III) that are designed to (Star Wars I-III) accommodate little kids (Star Wars I-III) always end up being insulting to the same kids (And to the adults who bring the kids). It's because all of the best cartoons were made to be funny for ADULTS. And that is what we have here, a cartoon made to amuse adults, made funny for adults, and enjoyable by adults. Except for one problem: It is not a cartoon.It is - I don't Know what it is! It's not a Movie is it? Except that it was put onto film and run in Theatres... But it was not MADE on any film medium. This was all done on the best computers using the cleverest programmers and most talented animators in their respective fields. But FILM it is Not - More like ""Computer Created Entertainment.""This CGI cartoon references other top hitters like Chinatown (water theft), and the appearance of CGI Clint Eastwood as the ""Spirit of the West"" in a scene that mirrors a scene from Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End- This film - I don't know what else to call it because this is not really a film. It's all Digital, but it was shown in Movie Theatres. Well, this Huge Computer Environment-Based Entertainment which was SHOWN in Theatres, made fun out of all kinds of movies that were made on Film.And that is what makes it great. It's a new direction for animation. Because it's not impossible imagery blended in with real life action and actors... It is completely imaginary... Which makes it real in a sense.In a way, it is film, because some of the animations used Motion Capture techniques - Some direct motion capture, and other keyframe animations that were created alongside an actor's filmed movements. So, it was all character driven, Just like Gollum in Lord of the Rings - But now, instead of just one character being CGI, they all are. And believable too-Because of the shunning of Symmetry. Even Bug's Bunny's face as perfectly symmetrical in those old cartoons, but here, Rango's face is like Johnny Depp's face - A Human face, even though Rango is a Lizard, Non- Symmetrical. And also with the other Lizards, Mice, Field rats, Foxes, Turtles, and Clit Eastwoods that were in this...

51,estebangonzalez10,Pixar still reigns over Nickelodeon,5,6 March 2011,"¨So you want something to believe in? Believe in that there sign. For as long as it hangs there we've got hope. ¨2010 was a great year for animated films (I guess that's the correct term for them now since no one calls them cartoons anymore) with Toy Story 3, How to Train Your Dragon, and Tangled all ranking among my Top 25 Films of last year. Rango is the first film I've seen from 2011 since I had a lot of catching up to do with last year's movies before the Award Season ended; and one thing is for sure: Rango won't rank among my favorite films for this year. Rango is director Gore Verbinski's (known for The Ring and the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy) first animated film and he's receiving a lot of positive reviews so far in his incursion to the animated field. I wasn't as excited as most critics were however since I was a little disappointed with the story. There is no denying that the visuals were stunning and the CGI animation was breathtaking, but the story really didn't work for me. I didn't think the characters had any depth to them and the story really dragged at several points of the film for no apparent reason rather than to evoke the mood of most Westerns. Rango is a parody of Spaghetti Westerns (fans of the genre will find plenty of spoofs from several movies including The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly) and the title of the film is actually inspired on another Western, Django. The visuals truly capture the beautiful scenery we see in most westerns, but the story just seemed to be all over the place and I failed to connect with it. There were also very few funny moments as I didn't find many of the spoofs that amusing, and I don't see how kids would find them funny at all.As for the plot goes we are introduced to Rango (voiced by the great Johnny Depp), a green chameleon wearing a red Hawaiian tee-shirt. He seems to spend most of his time in his cage imagining himself saving a damsel from distress (actually a head-less Barbie doll) from an evil villain (a Nemo-like toy fish). While he is in the midst of this imaginary feat, the vehicle where his cage is at the present time swirls making it fly out of the car and break, so Rango finds himself free in the middle of the desert. He encounters an armadillo (Alfred Molina), who guides him to the town of Dirt, a town in desperate need for a hero since there is a shortage of water. Rango encounters Beans (Isla Fisher) who warns him about the situation in the town of Dirt and the little hospitality the townsfolk have with foreigners, but Rango has no problem making friends by lying and telling stories about his ¨heroic acts.¨ His odds are improved when he accidentally kills a hawk, which happened to terrorize everyone in the village. Rango becomes the local hero and the Mayor (Ned Beatty) appoints him as the new Sheriff of Dirt. It's the opportunity he has been dreaming of: becoming a hero, but there is a lot more to this town than meets the eye. The Mayor seems to be hiding some crucial information about the water supply, and with the hawk out of the picture the locals now fear that Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) will return to terrorize them. I tried to simplify the plot as much as I could as there are actually a lot of things going on that aren't developed really well. The plot does draw heavily from Chinatown (screenwriter John Logan actually claimed he was inspired in that film when he wrote the story) and it spoofs many Westerns (Bill Nighy said he was inspired in the bad character from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly and we see Rango wearing a poncho like the man with no name did in that same film). John Logan has done some interesting work in the past (Sweeny Todd, Aviator, and Gladiator), but I really didn't enjoy this story that much. Rango simply didn't live up to the great animated films from last year, and the visuals were just not enough to save this film since that has become a known asset in every animated movie. I do think that the CGI was a bit above average from other animated movies, but it wasn't enough to save the poor story. I really had high expectations for this film since I enjoy Westerns and thought it was about time for a good animated Western to come out. I just didn't think this movie had any heart, like say Toy Story 3 or Tangled had. I just didn't get emotionally attached with Rango and didn't find it very funny at all. I wouldn't recommend this.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Rango
52,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"A mature, beautifully made gem of a film!",10,2 July 2015,"RangoGore Verbinski's Rango is a wonder amongst animated films. Naturally, the colourful, larger than life medium lends itself to the eyes, ears and hearts of children, which is the direction most of the, take. But Rango presents a mature, raunchy, surreal, absurd spectacle rife with a mischievous buzz, and peppered with laughs just bordering on the inappropriate for children, even though they'd go right over their heads anyway.this movie broke the record for how many times my jaw hit the floor seeing what they could do with the visuals. It's detailed, meticulous, gorgeously rendered and beautifully crafted. Johnny Depp gives wit, endearing naivety, and a sense of childlike wonder to his creation Rango, a little lizard in the big desert, violently thrown from a car wreck into the greatest adventure of his life, and the archetypal heroes journey. He wanders through the baking Mojave desert, into the town of Dirt, inhabited by sassy, lovable creatures modelled after all our favourite western characters. He blunders his way into becoming the sheriff, and leads the whole town on a quest to locate their most sought after resource: Aqua. Verbinski directs with a snappy, take no prisoners sense of humour, throwing joke after joke after one liner after tongue in cheek nod at us, until we feel so bombarded with fantastic imagery, brilliant voice acting and just plain fun, that we more than feel like we're getting our money's worth. Each animal is beautifully designed, from the evil Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy having a ball with a mini gun tail and Amber orange eyes), to Beans (a fellow lizard and love interest for our scaly hero), to the sleazy mayor (Ned Beatty, that old turtle), to a rampaging band of bank robbing moles led by a blind Harry Dean Stanton. The film is so full of detail, beauty and ambitious artistry that it has taken me at least 3 views to feel like I've noticed every character, every one line, very brilliant little touch. It's that good. Among the whacky antics there's a theme of owning up to ones identity, becoming responsible for people you save, and finishing the work or task you set out to do, lest you leave your legacy unwritten, and leave your Greek chorus (represented hilariously here by a trio of Mariachi Owls) with no end to their song. That kind of weight and thought put into an animated film gives me hope for the medium as something more than just whacky enjoyable children's fare, and even so I feel like like if more of the, had these kinds of themes, in them, our young ones may not necessarily understand the, but subconsciously benefit more off them, than off just the pyrotechnics and visual magic alone.

54,3xHCCH,"Not for Kids, Not Exactly A Good Time",5,19 March 2011,"""Rango"" tells about a lonely pet chameleon with an active imagination who was one day suddenly thrown off his owner's car, and into the real world. His tall tales of deadly exploits make him the sheriff of a lawless rundown town of Dust in the Mojave Desert, which was having a water crisis. When the bad guys steal their last five days supply of water, Rango must now walk his talk and apprehend the bandits.This was a very strange animated movie. I do not think this was for kids at all. The theme and story were very mature, even the language (with minor cuss words). The drawings are not at all what we would traditionally call ""nice."" The characters were all not exactly pleasant little critters of the desert. There were scenes of hard drinking, cigar smoking, gun violence, morbid hangings and even a rather raunchy scene with a naked Barbie torso. I don't know if they thought the image of a armadillo gored in the midriff still talking was supposed to be funny.Rango himself is written and illustrated in a very irritating way. It was uncomfortable to look at him or those stupid things he was doing. It was as if Mr. Bean became a lizard. I don't know if knowing that it was Johnny Depp voicing Rango would really help. The lead female character Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher) looked like a creature from ""Avatar,"" but I have no idea what animal she was supposed to have been. Those momentary spells where she would blank out were more disturbing than funny. There were some good points too in this Gore Verbinski film. The cameo tributes to Westerns were good, like Morricone's music and Clint Eastwood. The villains were seriously well-written, especially the oily Mayor (Ned Beatty) and the scary Jake (Bill Nighy). There were some pretty witty one-liners throughout the script. While ugly, the details in the animal characters is admittedly intricate and shows a lot of hard work by the animators.

Johnny Depp gives a great voice performance as the titular character Rango, and even though he shines magnificently, the film also hold many fantastic voice performances from actors all around. The peculiar thing about Rango, is that it is so firmly grounded upon its own story, and not only fully embraces it, but it is fully believable, which is an insane task to feat. The film is beautifully animated, containing some of the best CGI for a film of the 2010's and beyond. It can be a wonderfully witty satire when it calls for it, and a badass western when it needs it. Rango is full of style, class, humor, rich atmosphere, and a fantastic storyline. I was entertained all the way through watching it, even when it almost clocks in at about 2 hours, and honestly will be willing to watch it again anytime. The film is written spectacularly well, and directed so as well, and is easily one of the best, if not the best, animated feature I have ever seen.

They were detailed but cartoonish. Best of all, they were truly ugly. These characters aren't here to sell toys, they are here to inhabit the world that surrounds them. A lot of the humor comes from Rango attempting to fit into such a violent culture. This isn't the best source of humor. A wonderful voice cast lend their vocals to the animated creations, which pop out of the screen, despite being in 2D. Proving that 3D is a ridiculous and pointless piece of trash (unless used as a gimmick), when Rattlesnake Jake slithers on screen, it feels like he coming straight for you.",Rango

I would go as far as saying there is none finer; in the most skillful animated techniques and also for the Hollywood stars that do the voice overs (for each character). It makes subtle references to such iconic Italian Westerns such as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' but has it's own unique story and style. Containing the most vital and dynamic action in this particular and highly competitive genre Johnny Depp is the voice for a new Western hero, called 'Rango'.",Rango

The other animated movie that I saw this year is this one, which I think was better than Rio. Set in a western town, the film stars Johnny Depp as Rango, a lizard who accidentally lands up in the town of Dirt, an outpost which needs a new sheriff. Along the way, the green chameleon meets some new friends, and is given a job to find new water for the town, which is in a drought. The film ends when Rango kills Jake, a mighty rattlesnake in charge of the water supply, and then Rango becomes sheriff. I thought the animation was great, the casting well done, and the humor plentyful. Highly recommended.",Rango
60,pc95,Drags Sometimes but Overall OK,6,24 September 2011,"""Rango"", a new Dreamworks animation has some good moments for sure, but the movie drags in several places and is overall more boring than exciting on the whole. The dialog sometimes doesn't really engage or is silly. The animation itself is competent mostly, but spoiler the whole desert and western theme just wasn't very captivating. Johnny Depp is a likable actor, and he proves himself a capable voice actor here as well, but Rango is sort of devoid of personality. We see he enjoys play-acting in the beginning and is left to the same sorts of antics in the wild west town, but the movie seems kind of superficial in the dialog. The jokes are hit- and-miss. I liked the bats/wagon-chase scene as entertaining, but the western theme is sort of stale as a whole. I guess Rango can be mildly recommended as OK.",Rango

62,brando647,One of the Best Animated Films I've Seen,9,24 August 2011,"RANGO is one of the most entertaining films I've seen so far in 2011. Following in the footsteps of Dreamwork's SHREK franchise, RANGO is an animated film that's fun enough for kids but has enough elements that appeal to adult audiences that we can enjoy it too. At it's core, it's a simple fish-out-of-water premise where a lot of the humor is derived from a stranger's interactions in a new land he doesn't quite understand. RANGO goes a little deeper than your average kid flick, creating an interesting and somewhat complex character. RANGO is about an ordinary household pet chameleon en route down a desert highway with his owners when a freak occurrence drops him alone in the middle of nowhere. He stumbles his way a rundown little town named Dirt, where the inhabitants are in the middle of an ongoing drought. Seeing his chance to inhabit a new role, the chameleon adopts the name Rango and passes himself as one of the toughest sharpshooters to ever live. His big talk lands him in big trouble when he is brought on as Dirt's sheriff and it falls on him to discover where all the water's gone.Let me start by saying that I've noticed a lot of people trying to say this isn't for kids...that a few scattered, very mild profanities and some peril are too much for young minds. Well, my four-year-old daughter loves it and she enjoys the film without mimicking the little bit of questionable content there is. I took her to see it in the theater and she's made me watch it at least 20 times since we got it on DVD. The complex themes of identity and destiny pass right over her, but she loves it when the hawk gets its head stuck in a can. I personally love it for it's attempt at being more than your average kid's toon. It's got some great tripped out sequences as Rango wanders the desert coming to grips with his dilemma, including one where he finds the ""Spirit of the West""...a little nod towards the man who defined the gunslinger genre: Clint Eastwood driving a golf cart loaded with Oscars and voiced by star of HBO's DEADWOOD, Timothy Olyphant. There's also a funny nod in the beginning to Johnny Depp's friend and drugged out gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. I was surprised that I was the only adult in the theater that caught it and got a good laugh from the homage to FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.The animation in this film is amazing. It's probably the best CG I've seen in a film. The textures, the cinematography, the character movement...it's beautiful. The inhabitants of Dirt are caricatures of characters we've seen in countless Westerns before, and the character design is hilarious. The visuals are fantastic and ILM has proved they could give other animation studios a run for their money if they can continue putting out quality films like this. The film boasts an excellent voice cast with Johnny Depp (Rango), Isla Fisher, Alfred Molina, Stephen Root, Ray Winstone, and more. Ned Beatty is Dirt's corrupt tortoise mayor, playing the villain again after last year's stint as Lotso in TOY STORY 3. Bill Nighy arrives in the final act of the film to steal every scene he's ""in"" as Rattlesnake Jake. I thought the man was awesome as Davy Jones in the PIRATES films, and he brings his evil to the coolest character in RANGO. My only problem with the film was that it felt a little too long and some of the drawn out parts could've been trimmed a bit to streamline the film. If you're looking for a film to watch with kids that won't bore you to tears or having you rolling your eyes, this is it.",Rango
63,moviexclusive,"Wacky and delightful, this Wild West adventure is a giddy burst of creative imagination unlike anything you've ever seen before",8,23 March 2011,"Proving that there is no such genre which cannot be turned into an animation with the right creative imagination, Gore Verbinski's ""Rango"" is probably one of the first ever animated Westerns- and what a giddily delightful burst of imagination it is! Indeed, there is so much to admire and appreciate about ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Verbinski's latest reteaming with Johnny Depp that multiple viewings is probably a must. The titular character voiced by Depp is a domesticated lizard living in a terrarium with a broken doll and a wind-up orange plastic fish. When we first encounter him, Rango is dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and acting out scenes from Shakespeare to kill time; though in between reading the Bard, he also displays a propensity for soliloquies. It turns out that Rango's aquarium is in fact on a moving vehicle, and a sudden swerve leaves the coddled pet chameleon stranded in the middle of the Mojave Desert ready to begin his journey of self-discovery. Right from the start, it is clear that John Logan's screenplay (working from a story by Verbinski, James Ward Byrkit and Logan himself) isn't going to be of the run-of-the-mill family-friendly type. Indeed, Rango's journey turns out to be a surprisingly mature and thoughtful one, as Logan shows that he isn't afraid to delve into complex themes of identity and existentialism- one of the oft-repeated catchphrases in the movie is the appropriately deep saying ""nobody can walk out of his own story"". That's not to say Logan has put aside his sense of humour here, though the jokes also tend to be geared towards a more adult audience. Yes, one doubts that the kids will find the suitably titled armadillo Roadkill (Alfred Molina), whom Rango meets in the middle of a busy highway, amusing; or a fellow desert creature cursing Rango ""son of a -----"" with the last word replaced by the shriek of a hawk hilarious- but Logan's deliciously quirky story comes with sharp dialogue and distinctive wit. Both are clearly evident in every turn of the story, starting from Rango's arrival in the town called Dirt. Populated by a menagerie of lizards, rodents, amphibians, reptiles and other desert creatures, Rango proceeds to impress the desperate citizens of the town with his made-up tale of derring-do, and promptly gets himself appointed sheriff. His first task? To solve the town's most pressing problem- water. Water is pretty much Dirt's most valuable resource, not only their currency of trade but also the commodity which makes up their reserve in the Bank. Of late though, it's been especially hard to come by, and it soon occurs to the citizens that someone's been stealing their precious supply. Rango's closest equivalent to a sidekick is a fellow lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher) and she suspects it has something to do with the town's Mayor (Ned Beatty), a wizened, wheelchair-bound turtle who tells Rango on their first meeting that controlling the town's water supply is akin to controlling the townsfolk. There are definite plot similarities to Roman Polanski's 1974 classic ""Chinatown"" and indeed they are not coincidental. With ""Rango"", Logan and Verbinski pay homage to the classic spaghetti Westerns from John Ford to Sergio Leone- there's even an appearance by the Man with No Name (voiced here by Timothy Olyphant doing his best gruff Clint Eastwood impersonation). Particularly notable too is Verbinski's tribute to the helicopter attack in ""Apocalypse Now"" in his staging of a thrilling action sequence with flying bats- and this as well as other subtler references will certainly please film buffs. But Verbinski's greatest accomplishment is in creating a fascinating world intricately designed with so much rich detail. Working with his ""Pirates"" visual effects wizard Mark McCreery as production designer, Verbinski's Dirt town is steeped in the classic iconography of the West- bars, billiards, and saloons- while simultaneously unique in its variety of denizens. Industrial Light and Magic was behind the animation- this their maiden effort- and they have done a beautiful job with the characters. Whether reptile or amphibian, each creature is distinctively rendered, and despite the scraggly look on each of them, there is more than enough loving detail in each sets them apart. Credit must also go to veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins who serves as visual consultant, and gives the desert environment the same kind of visual dynamism that he captured in the Coens' Westerns ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""True Grit"". ""Rango"" also stands out from other animations by having its actors record their voices in costumes and actual sets together, rather than record their respective parts in sound booths- and Verbinski's decision has paid off handsomely. The delivery by the ensemble cast (including Depp, Molina, Beatty, Fisher, Harry Dean Stanton as the patriarch of a rodent gang and Bill Nighy as the menacing rattlesnake Jake) is sharp and well-timed, and lend that added zing to Logan's dialogue. And certainly with Logan's uniquely quirky and mature story, Verbinski's lively storytelling, as well as Johnny Depp and the rest of the ensemble cast's outstanding voice work, ""Rango"" is a rollicking Wild West adventure packed with humour, wit, and excitement. Remember that burst of creative imagination that you saw in the first ""Pirates""? Well, Depp and Verbinski have brought that same spark to this latest collaboration, and their newfangled take on the Old West is a delightful burst of creative imagination that will go down as one of the most original works of animation you'll see this year.www.moviexclusive.com",Rango
64,saadgkhan,"Rango is a delightful surprise out of its creepiness. It's funny, utterly disgusting and highly entertaining.",7,3 July 2011,"RANGO – CATCH IT ( B+ ) I hate lizards and watching a movie about lizard's adventure was one of the toughest things to do, believe it or not I practically shut it down 3-4 times as I couldn't bear to watch a Green lizard on screen. But eventually, I got over it and then I really started to enjoy it. It won't be wrong to say that it's full of ugly looking creatures/insects/reptiles etc. in a movie ever. Now, if I surpass my hatred for the rats and reptiles etc. These filthy creatures also make this movie unique and amusing. After The Ring & Pirates trilogy, Gore Verbinski impresses us with his direction again. He rightly uses the voice talents from ever adoring Johnny Depp (who made us to Love Pirates & kind of Green Chameleon), to Isla Fisher as Deserts Iguana to Abigail Breslin as Cactus mouse to all other supporting weird ugly looking creatures.

65,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Why the heck does Rango have a current 7.3/10 stars? It was boring and incredibly dumb!,2,28 December 2014,"I'm only giving Rango two stars for its animation. I honestly think the only reason people are rating it so high was because Johnny Depp was in the voice cast and he's a popular actor. I watched Rango with my little brother; we both started out enjoying it but fifteen minutes into it we were falling asleep! Basically a chameleon (somebody's pet) winds up stranded in the desert and finds his way to a dusty and dangerous town with some seriously psychotic animals and seemingly no rules at all. Rango agrees to be the town sheriff (because he wants water and a nearby city has set up a pump that took the water from the animals).Rango didn't have good soundtrack, and yes Johnny Depp fans, not the best voice acting, you read that correctly. The story made very little sense and appeared to be for children, but there were various scenes that were rather inappropriate for kids so I have no idea what sort of audience this thing was aimed at. It's a morbid movie with a lot of dark humor, and the small town, wild-west style animals appear to have lost their marbles (Priscilla, a little girl possum, suggests eating a dead animal, another character has been named Roadkill, and so on). It just couldn't resist shoving its enviro-propaganda in your face with the ""water pump city"" part of the story, the universal and untrue message of, ""nature is good, humans are bad, you're killing cute little animals by building cities"" plays a part in this movie that's highly annoying (I'm pro-pollution so I'm a little biased).Overall, this is one movie my brother and I won't be watching again, it was pretty bad. It totally shocks me that it has a 7.3/10 stars (as of December 2014). Who the hell is rating this so high? My god, what happened to all the intelligent people in the world, were they abducted by aliens or something? Oh well, society is collapsing, it's been collapsing ever since cellular phones, environmentalism and bad movies like this. I expect that in twenty years or so we'll all be devolving back to apes. :(",Rango

67,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Having just seen this recently, it's any kid's gateway drug to Western cinema.",8,17 September 2018,"Rango is a kid's film that knows the confines of family entertainment whilst trying to simultaneously break them as well: this movie has smoking, drinking and gunfights-galore, something that American animated movies tend to steer clear of. This one has all the archetypal characters you'd see in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti-Westerns and John Ford's Hollywood-Westerns, except they're computer-animated animals in a Nickelodeon production (the same guys who gave us Spongebob and Rugrats) and it's amazing that they'd let such taboo themes and imagery in a kids movie in the first place.How does this tale of a happy-go-lucky modern-world lizard against an Old-West backdrop convey the juxtapositions of modernism and that of the American frontier? It's surprising that Rango is that kind of movie: it's a comedy-adventure movie with hints of cinematically classical themes of good vs evil and told in ways that aren't boringly derivative of other movies prior to this one. Rango succeeds in being kid-friendly while trying to use that status to show how subversive the final product can be compared to other animated movies on the market.Rango is a rock-solid 4/5 stars for me.",Rango

While this had goofy looking characters and it is a CGI animation movie. This is not a kids movie. There is so much going on in Rango that definitely won't make sense to them.In essence Rango (obviously a Parody on Django) is a spaghetti western. Only now the lead is a chameleon voiced by Johnny Depp. Rango is filled with funny and slapstick moments.But it also has some real serious sequences. This is the surprising element that should not work and still it does. Trying to explain them will be difficult cause most of those scenes are very visual without dialog. Describing it won't do justice to them any way. People familiar with Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy will recognize Gore Verbinski's style.It simply is his best movie yet to date.Even better than the first POTC movie?. In my opinion yes.You can clearly see that a lot of work and love is put into it. For movie fans there are references throughout. One that really stands out is an epic scene involving a man with no name and a golf cart.Ultimate coolness. Don't make the mistake comparing this to CGI movies like Ice Age,Kungfu Panda or similar. Approach it like it is fully fledged western that has everything and more of that genre.If you get past that than you will have the pleasure to see one of the most funny and entertaining movies made this year.A must watch!",Rango
70,oneguyrambling,The best non-Pixar animated effort in years.,8,23 July 2011,"Rango is not a real name, only a pseudonym. A pseudonym chosen in haste by a chameleon stranded far from home and under pressure.But as he has selected the name that is what I will use.Rango is a small, skinny, goggle-eyed chameleon with a large angular head perched upon a crooked and frail looking neck. He is articulate yet clueless, self confident but unsure at the same time.Suffice to say that his quick tongue tends to get him into more trouble than it extracts him from.The story proper starts when Rango – though at this stage still a nameless house-lizard – is thrown from his safe but bland pet tank in the family car. Stranded and initially alone Rango takes advice from a near roadkill and heads off into the harsh and inhospitable desert. It is there that he finds himself in a small Western style town. The town of Dirt. Where water is so rare that it has become a currency, albeit an ever increasingly rare one.After some dealings with the locals and a run in with a hawk, Rango finds instant credibility with a town in need of a hero after he ad-libs his way through the tale of how he killed the Jenkins boys with a single bullet.All seven of them In recognition of this newfound renown an elderly turtle – ahem – 'the Mayor', dubs Rango Sheriff and gives him the task of guarding the town's ever diminishing water supply.Then the water goes missing Rango was unexpected. I didn't actually even plan to check it out but got roped along when Battle:Los Angeles was packed. The film was extremely entertaining and funnier than any animated film I can think of off hand. Johnny Depp absolutely slays as the titular reptile, with a scattergun delivery and a voice that is part Hunter S Thompson, part Willie Wonka (there is even a Hunter S Thompson nod in the early going).I found myself chuckling along at non-jokes simply because of his ridiculous intensity and the alternating cocksure boasting and increasing desperation as he realises he is a lizard out of his depth. But don't worry, padding out the non-jokes are several real ones, a few cracked me up and thankfully they weren't painstakingly built and obviously looming.The animation is incredible. Each critter (and there are a great many) is rendered beautifully – even the incredibly ugly ones – and feature amazing detail. Funnily enough the most 'cartoony' is perhaps Rango himself, though his buggy eyes tend to tell a story all of their own.It mattered little to me but this is definitely not the flick to park the kids in front of for an hour. There are numerous nods and winks to adults, which I recognise Pixar does too, but these are distinctly more 'adult'. The afore-mentioned Hunter S Thompson cameo, a pretty graphic vision of the near-roadkill and several other moments that depending on viewer age might be considered scary or gross. Let's just say I know of a 4 year old and a 6 year old that I wouldn't accompany to the theatre for a viewing. (Maybe 8ish might be OK? But I'm guessing.) Again I didn't see Rango coming. It was a surprising blend of fresh and different comedy in unexpected surroundings, capped off by a superlative voice job by Depp and quality work from a cavalcade of stars including Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy, Alfred Molina, Ray Winstone and even Timothy Olyphant pulling off a very worthy Clint Eastwood impression. This is all only enhanced still by some of the best animation and character design that I have ever seen.It will require a second viewing before I would be willing to elevate Rango to 'Great' status, but at this point I am happy enough to state that this is the best film so far this year. (Alright Winter's Bone was better but it sure wasn't this much fun.) Final Rating – 8 / 10. This tale of a colour-changing lizard's journey to find himself and save a small town isn't as kiddie as it might sound. The best non-Pixar animated film so for many years.",Rango
71,areatw,"Different and entertaining, but not without its flaws",7,11 September 2017,"'Rango' is an unusual blend of genres - there certainly aren't many animated family western movies out there. I like the idea though and thought that the western setting really added something special to the film. It's a unique visual experience that is unlikely to ever be replicated, or at least not to the same level as this one. It does have some very noticeable flaws though.The plot is adequate but lacks any real depth, which is predictable for a family movie, but even so. I also found 'Rango' to be unnecessarily long. There's no way an animated kids film with a plot as thin as this should be pushing 2 hours. Putting things into perspective though, 'Rango' is good overall. The characters are interesting and funny and the voice acting is all on point. Johnny Depp was a great choice to voice Rango and brings a lot of enthusiasm and personality to the role.",Rango
72,blott2319-1,Stuff that's been done (better) in the past,4,13 January 2021,"Rango is well-trodden territory as far as the story goes. The reason that this particular chameleon finds himself in an Old West town populated by many different animals doesn't change the fact that the whole thing felt familiar. It's about the clueless newcomer in town who is given an important position because he lies about his qualifications, and then he has to learn to live up to the lies. I think where this movie struggled the most for me was in the fact that Rango seemed to adapt to frontier life way too quickly. I mean, aside from the fact that he lied to them, I don't really see why the townsfolk would feel all that betrayed when the truth is revealed about his past. Frankly, no matter what he was before he came there, he does just fine with nearly everything this town throws at him. Perhaps that's why I never fully bought into this movie and felt a tad disinterested. Also, the character archetypes were fairly obvious, which made the plot overly predictable. I also felt there wasn't enough meat in the script (I've seen half-hour television shows that have managed to encapsulate similar plots) so they would often waste time with side-stories that didn't further the main storyline in any noticeable way. There's nothing inherently wrong with Rango as a film, but it simply didn't do much for me. Perhaps if I first saw it as a kid it would have worked for me in the same way that things like Fievel Goes West did.",Rango

75,MrGKB,There's a new animator in town...,8,3 September 2011,"...and his name is Industrial Light & Magic. He's packin' some heavy iron in the form of excellent direction by Gore ""Pirates...""

Fisher, Ned ""You...will...atone!"" Beatty, Alfred ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" Molina, and Bill ""Gore likes me"" Nighy, among numerous others. At times reminiscent of some of the older Looney Tunes features, ""Rango"" sports a fair complement of in-jokes and homages to a variety of sources, including ""High Noon,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Chinatown,"" and Leone/Eastwood's iconic ""Man With No Name."" The film's (relative) failure at the box office--it missed the mark on earning back production costs domestically--was likely a consequence of a somewhat darker, mordant edge to its humor and storyline that made it less appealing to children, coupled with an inescapable current of video-gamishness (cf. Byrkit's likely contributions) that dissipated adult interest. Nonetheless, it will undoubtedly do well on video, and hopefully well enough to encourage ILM into further animated ventures.

76,KnightsofNi11,The best kids movies aren't always for kids,9,19 September 2011,"What sort of expectations can you possibly set for a CGI kids movie about a lizard in the old West? For me, it was relatively none. I didn't think anything of Rango after seeing the first trailers and immediately discarded it as another kiddie film that I would have no reason to see. But then the movie came out and the buzz began and the surprisingly positive reviews started coming out. It wasn't long before I decided I actually did need to see this movie. It was a while till I got around to actually doing the deed, but boy was it worth it.Rango is, and I mean this in an utterly sincere fashion, an incredibly brilliant film. Johnny Depp stars as the voice of the title character, Rango, a pet chameleon who falls out of the back of his owner's truck while on the highway, only to find himself lost in the vastness of the Nevada desert. He eventually finds his way to the town of Dirt, an old and decrepit town filled with old and decrepit rodents who are in desperate need of water before their town dries up. Rango shows up alone in the town, known by nobody, so he decides to create a new persona for himself, dawning an Eastwood-esque man with no name facade that gets him into a lot more trouble than he bargained for. The film is sharp, hysterical, action-packed, and more trippy than you can believe.Rango possesses an immaculate sense of bizarre uniqueness that carries the film and makes it a truly wild experience. It delivers a painfully hilarious script backed by very impressive voice acting and Gore Verbinski's direction of the film gives it a cartoony and incredibly entertaining flare. This film is of a certain quality that is so rare within the kid film genre, especially the part of the genre that isn't made by Pixar. Rango takes CGI storytelling to a whole new level and transcends the ideas of what your typical talking animal film should look like and feel like. Pixar is known for its low brow subtleties that allow adults to enjoy their films as much as kids. Rango, on the other hand, takes it a step further and prides itself on its clever innuendos and shockingly inappropriate quips. To a certain demographic (i.e. uptight parents) this is appalling and disgusting. But to me, I thought it was genius to market a film as a kids flick and then blow the rest of us away when we realize that this is a film that arguably has more humor aimed towards adults than kids. While some may bash Rango for this, I give it incredulous amounts of kudos.Not only is Rango's humor great and it makes the film a blast, the action sequences in the film are brilliantly fun and the overall visual quality of the flick is superb. Gore Verbinski directs the film with incredible finesse, showing off a range of styles within one two hour film. The film can be wacky and fun, as well as sophisticated and sincere with direction, artistic design, and cinematography that captures the various moods and atmospheres Rango weaves through. And of course let's not forget the amazing CGI. The detail of every last hair on the back of a rodent, every last scale on a lizard, and every last grain of sand in the vast open desert is mind boggling. The film is pieced together so well artistically, possessing not a single flaw in its visual integrity.And perhaps what I love most about the look of this film is that it breaks all stereotypes of the idealized talking CGI animals that we are familiar with. There is nothing cute or fluffy about these critters. They are absolutely the ugliest bunch of greasy, grimy, disgusting rodents ever animated onto the big screen. The characters in this film resemble the things you find under the sink and then promptly kill and/or scream in terror. And that is really what Rango is all about in essence. It isn't about idealizing the happy-go-lucky world of talking animals. It highlights the more grotesque aspects of this fantasy land, while still managing to be hysterical. When it comes to animated films, you won't see enough like Rango, so see this movie so you don't miss out on one of the best ""kids films"" to come out in a long time.",Rango

Certainly they must have known they'd alienate large chunks of the ticket-buying polity who are put off by verbal finery, in much the same way they're put off by Bach: Too many notes. I'd be very, very curious to know the percentage of Rango's viewers who'd previously seen Chinatown. I'd guess 10%--and that's 5% happenstance, and 5% film buffs drawn in by word-of-mouth.They pulled a lot of stops to make Rango happen, and you have to at least tip your hat to that.

Ratatouille was a good example of the best that this can be; and kudos to Disney for evolving and recognizing this as the future of grand animation storytelling. The head doesn't have to be the enemy of the heart.Well, Rango seems to want to take this a step further. And in so doing, it might have tipped its hand a little too far and spoiled the feeling. There are long stretches of characters ambling across barren landscapes, exchanging barbs, witticisms, and naive pronouncements. Do people go to cartoons to wait for Godot? If they sometimes do, then the next question is: Is it worth the wait? In Rango, it rather is. Certain messages are delivered, the most important of which is: It's possible to get stuck in a personal storyline; an internal narrative with the power to entrance and delight in the short term, but ultimately powerless in the face of real world forces. And some of these forces are evil, and facing off these forces requires genuine heroism. And real heroism must break the chains of mere story. Only then can it become mythic in scope, and succeed.Rango does this, but you're going to have to wait for Godot for a spell. If you're not ready to do that, then you're going to be disappointed. But if you're patient and cool, who knows *what* you'll find in McElligot's Pool!",Rango
79,Animany94,Something you don't see every day.,8,9 October 2019,"Rango was definitely an inventive movie when it came out. Not only that, but also something that's not very common in animation like a western themed movie. And much more convincing at that than let's say Home On The Range or Fievel Goes West.While I must admit that the plot had its predictability in some places. The beginning showcases exactly that when the domesticated lizard Rango ends up in unfamiliar surroundings and pretends to be a hot-shot. Even if the script offers many mature themes and interesting ideas, that choice of story made me guess a handful of outcomes.But that's the only criticism I have towards Rango, because everything else is astounding like the animation and the characters. Animation wise it even looks like something Pixar could have made or even better, and that's the biggest compliment one can get.",Rango
80,ajs-10,"Animated fun with the voice talents of Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher and Ned Beatty",8,8 January 2012,"This is a film I've wanted to see for some time, although I didn't know all that much about it. Recommendations did the trick, but it never made it to my local cinema and so I waited for a TV airing. As you can probably guess, it aired this week and I'm pleased to say the recommendations were correct! Although not quite up there with the best of the Pixar films, it's still very entertaining and beautifully animated. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.When a pet chameleon is involved in an accident that leaves him on a desert road, he looks for help. It first comes in the form of an old armadillo called Roadkill; he sets the chameleon off in the direction of the nearest town, Dirt. On the way he is picked up by Beans who is going to town for supplies for her ranch. Once there the chameleon enters the saloon where he makes himself out to be a bit of a hero a hero called Rango! The townsfolk immediately make him the sheriff; but there's a problem. The town is running out of water, there's very little left in the bank and the mayor is behaving strangely. When the remaining water is stolen from the bank it's up to Rango, and a posse, to go and bring it back. Also, can they solve the mystery of the disappearing water supply? Well, I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be confiscating my glass of nice cool refreshing water by my side here (thirsty?).As I've already said, it's beautifully animated and well worth seeing just for that alone! As for performances, well everyone was very good, particularly Johnny Depp as Rango/Lars, he surprised me with this performance; very reminiscent, at times, of his character, Raoul Duke, in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Isla Fisher as Beans and Abigail Breslin as Pricilla both put in great performances, as did Ned Beatty as the Mayor. Honourable mentions must also go to; Alfred Molina as Roadkill, Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake, Stephen Root as Doc/Merrimack/Mr. Snuggles, Harry Dean Stanton as Balthazar, Timothy Olyphant as Spirit of the West and Ray Winstone as Bad Bill.I must say I did like the offbeat style of this film, very reminiscent of an old Western but with a modern twist. Lots of slapstick comedy moments and some great sight gags add to the fun. A nice score by Hans Zimmer is interspersed by a nice collection of songs, principally performed by 'Los Lobos'. Over all, I found this film very entertaining with some great animation; one I will definitely re-watch sometime Recommended.My score: 7.9/10.IMDb Score: 7.4/10 (based on 57,195 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 88/100 (based on 205 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 69/100 (based on 94,672 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",Rango

82,deatman9,A good movie,6,23 November 2012,This is probably one of my favorite Animated movies of recent memory. It stars Johnny Depp who plays his part very well and is quite hilarious as a lizard. The animation is amazing everything looks very sharp and very well done. The story line keeps you very interested unlike many of the animated movie they have have somewhat of a child story line this one does not.This movie is about a lizard who has an owner but while driving his cage falls out of the car and he is stranded in the desert. He finds a small town of creatures like himself and creates a new identity for himself claiming he is a roughneck gun slinger.This movie is very good and has its funny moments. This seems more of an animated movie for older kids then younger.,Rango

Sad that most people seem to have forgotten this one.",Rango
84,jdkraus,"High marks in the animation and voice talent, but it is too long",9,25 March 2011,"This animated feature pretty much has everything that I hoped for when I walked in to the theater. The character design, modeling, lighting, texturing, and animating is flawless— almost photo realistic while retaining a cartoonish look. Much of the humor is aimed towards parodies of old westerns such as: the Spaghetti Westerns, High Noon, and Once Upon A Time In the West (to name a few). Even music from old Westerns is used, as well as some famous classical music pieces. Sight gags, one-liners, and even the sense of the absurd in some of the animation sequences are all incorporated into the film. The voice talent is simply brilliant. Johnny Depp's voice fits perfectly for the chameleon Rango. Ila Fisher follows through well with a southern accent as the lizard Beans. Abigail Breslin's adorable, young voice provides cuteness as Priscilla the Possum. Ned Beatty and Ray Winstone are great villains, but neither is as up to par as Bill Nighy for Rattlesnake Jake. He did a phenomenal job as Davy Jones in the Pirates films; here he is just awesome. I wish his character had more screen time. Unfortunately though, Rango runs into a big problem, the film moves too slowly. Usually, most animated features are no more than 90 minutes long. When they go past that point, they get boring. In rare cases, features such as ""The Incredibles"" move by quickly, regardless of the length. Rango does not have this talent. Part of this problem is due to the plot. The story is simple and nothing really unique, but it goes on way too long. Fifteen minutes needed to be cut. Another thing worth noting is that ""Rango"" is not a kid's movie. Though there are some sight gags, the fact it is animated, the humor is aimed more towards people who like the western genre. I grew up watching the old western pictures, so this movie is a real treat. People who are not familiar with the western films may not like this feature. In addition, some of the humor is adult oriented (some of it a bit much for a PG movie). Rango is a very good movie in my book, but it is not a major triumph like past works of DreamWorks and Pixar. My rating: 3.5/4",Rango
85,Hayden-86055,Name's Rango,7,2 July 2020,"A good animated film, I had never seen an animated western with animals before this. Johnny Depp is fantastic as always and the rest of the cast does a good job.Music is solid and whilst not up the standards of some older Western films like Good the bad and the ugly it's still quite good. I liked the actual cinematography of the film as well, how Rango and Beans stood out in almost every seen, compared to the drabness of the drabness of the town Rango is rather colourful.The plot is really interesting as well, with water being used as currency and the usual corrupt rich hoarding lots of it and not distributing it fairly. I've seen better plots but it's easy for children to follow and compelling enough for adultsAction wise I thought it was average personally but a certain serpentine character was very well designed and thoroughly intimidating.7/10: Definitely deserves a watch, especially if you're interested in classic westerns, and I think the genuinely interesting characters and animation are worth a viewing for people who like that stuff too",Rango
86,Likes_Ninjas90,"The film rides high on an abundance of charm, provided by its inventive and textured visuals",8,27 February 2011,"This animated feature is set in the Wild West and focuses on a chameleon (voiced by Johnny Depp). This little creature considers himself an actor and tries to put on performances with inanimate objects in his glass tank. After somehow breaking out, he's left to contend with the perils of the desert. Escaping the dangers of a hawk, the chameleon takes refuge with another lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher) who is heading back to her town of Dirt. When he arrives there himself, he finds that the town is continuously suspicious of outsiders. This is primarily because the town's water supplies are so low. There's barely enough to last for the next six days. To prove himself to his sceptics, the chameleon pretends to be a fierce outlaw, telling tales about his heroics. Winning the respect of the people, the chameleon calls himself Rango and is made the sheriff of Dirt. But the ambiguity surrounding Dirt's Mayor (Ned Beatty) and his stranglehold on the remaining water supply remains. Rango compensates for some familiar tropes and situations with a superior visual style and an expressive voice cast. Gore Verbinski's film is foremost a parody of the Western genre and it borrows heavily from the Chevy Chase spoof iThree Amigos! That film, a take on The Magnificent Seven itself, was also about a group of actors who entered a village and were mistaken for real gunslingers. I suspect there's a more contemporary political message running throughout Rango though. The town of Dirt lives off the idea of hope for a better future. But for a sheriff promising stability, Rango is reliably destructive and irresponsible, failing to keep order. Then there's the town's necessity for a precious resource, overshadowed by a tyrannic prospector. These political undertones are contained in a relatively foreseeable and familiar narrative, working with a common idea of so many animated pictures that the smallest person can make a difference. Nonetheless, the film rides high on an abundance of charm, provided by its inventive and textured visuals. The tone of the film remains light and playful but the visuals distinguish themselves from highly saturated pictures like Tangled and Toy Story 3, with grittier palettes. The arid, sunburnt planes are naturally fitting for a Western and the film compliments this hardened tone with equally dark character models too. There's more of an edge to the design of these characters because many of them are halfway between being anthropomorphic and more grotesque creatures. Abigail Breslin's Priscilla is for example a walking and talking rat. But she's also dressed like a school girl, with plaits, not unlike Hailee Steinfeld's character from True Grit. It's particularly funny how they resemble token characters from the Western genre too. It gives a unique but also more unsettling feel to the town, fitting of Rango's experience as an outsider. Adults will enjoy picking up on these genre references. Thankfully, the film is also regularly witty, courtesy of a funny screenplay script by John Logan. The slapstick action, moving from elaborate set pieces to more subtle visual gags, is equally humorous and beautiful, slickly controlled by Verbinski, working from his experience on the Pirates films. The voice cast is even more impressive, an enthusiastic line-up that gives life to even the smallest character. Johnny Depp, Abigail Breslin, Bill Nighy as a very creepy snake, Ray Winstone and many others are excellent. A lot of publicity has been given to the preparation of the voice work, specifically using the voice actors to act out the scenes themselves. Given the near-perfection of how Depp captures Rango's clumsiness, I would say that this technique has been a great success in drawing the actors closer to the scenarios and providing them with a greater understanding of their characters mannerisms.",Rango
87,Christian_Dimartino,One Gonzo cartoon.,9,17 July 2011,"Johnny Depp does the voice of Rango in Rango. I saw this film on its opening weekend and I wasn't crazy about it. It gave me a headache and I became lost in the story plot. But I saw it again a few months ago, and I really liked it.Rango is a tribute to Hunter S. Thompson, or I would say it is. The film is about Rango(Depp), a lonely lizard with a large imagination who flies out a window while on a car trip and ends up in the desert. Once he keeps walking, he finds a town called Dirt, filled with critters I can't even identify. And after fighting a hawk and telling the town a bunch of stories, becomes the towns sheriff.But Rango doesn't exactly know what hes doing. So when he has to find out what is happening to the towns water supply, he realizes that he has dug himself a hole hes going to have a hard time getting out of.Visually, Rango is the years best movie. Not visually, its still one of the best movies of the year. Its an animated movie that ISN'T for kids. Its dark, and darkly funny, and kids won't get it. There is a scene where Rango lands on the windsheild of Raoul Duke, who Johnny Depp played in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Its things like that that kids won't get, and things like that that I love about it.Rango is trippy and weird, but a visual marvel and a ton of fun, especially the second time. Its also well casted. We have Isla Fisher as the love interest, Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake, and Ned Beatty as the town's mayor. Rango is a must see, and this time, not for kids.A-",Rango
88,gigan-92,Pure Awesomeness,10,1 February 2012,"This film is a masterpiece and a glorious piece of animation. Firstly, you've got to recognize the film's balls. Instead of aiming to please the general audiences with cute and cuddly creatures, the characters you see here are anything but attractive. How many times have I seen an audience wooed to praise a film because of its 'cute factor'? No such shenanigans here. Secondly, it's a gritty storyline that holds faithful to the Western tradition. Its story telling isn't sugar coated and neither is its dialogue, surely to the dismay of some parents I assume. Its distinct style is why this film is so enjoyable and truth be told it probably isn't for all ages, but these days with morals going right out the windows, is it fair to say the argument starts to become invalid? Bill Nighy, as Rattlesnake Jake, was just bad-ass, awesome presence. Johnny Depp is remarkable as our Chameleon, and many other well done voice acting is in the film. Like Alfred Molina and Isla Fisher. The score by Hans Zimmer is irresistible, sounding very much like dare I say a Spaghetti Western. You even get to hear Richard Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" played briefly by the strings of a banjo. And speaking of spaghetti Westerns, I'm sure everybody thought there was a strong resemblance e to Eastwood's Man with No Name in that scene near the climax.

90,griffolyon12,Chameleons Need Friends Too!,8,10 March 2011,"Rango is a movie clearly inspired by the works of others to create something that is a unique mash-up, and it actually works. The movie has fun with these various different styles of the Western, managing to never fall into spoof territory, but simply remain fun and entertaining. It does this through a blend of humor and sophistication that is rarely found in children's films. The movie seems to at times draw influence from films of the French New Wave or the Italian Neorealists, where it seems Rango is breaking the Fourth Wall and is communing with the audience, ""Who am I?"" After all, a chameleon with an identity crisis (and no name to boot) is something that is a tad sad, and existential.Rango is a lonely critter, having no friends and no identity, spending all of his time in his cage creating stage plays with inanimate objects. But when this actor finds himself lost in the desert as a fascinating stranger in a small desert town called Dirt, he can fashion himself as a rough-and-tough, gunslinger named Rango, and be whatever the people want so he wont be alone. There is obviously a moral to this story, don't try to be what you aren't, just be you, and Johnny Depp's charismatic voice over work as Rango really makes this message ring true with the audience. There is something so lovable about how Depp plays Rango; he is funny, skittish, over-the-top in his mannerisms, and is essentially what makes this movie worth watching. No other character in the movie seems as alive as Rango, but there and again that is not a detriment to the other voice over performances, just high praise for Johnny Depp stealing the show.Even if Depp steals the show, director Gore Verbinski keeps the movie rolling with some slick action set pieces, including a marvelous sequence near the middle of the movie where Rango and his ""possum"" (aka posse) are fighting off a swarm of badguys while being trying to escape with a covered wagon. While these things seem so cliché to the Western film, the way everything is mashed together makes it feel fresh. The town of Dirt is imaginative, with the fronts of buildings being things like juice boxes or whatever, and the filmmakers never stop playing with these various desert animals and the stereotypes and odd eccentricities that they all have to make them funny. For example, when Rango sheds skin when he first walks out into the desert sunlight, these little touches with the scale of the world and the attributes of these characters keep the perspective where it needs to be in order for the audience to suspend our disbelief.Of course, as much as Rango keeps things humorous with their existential studies and Western homages, the movie often dips into the bag of just plain old annoying bathroom humor at times, like fart or burp gags, just to try and get a cheap laugh from the child audience whenever things seem to be going a little slow. So what if the movie takes its time to develop its thoughts and emotions? That makes for a great movie, so don't ruin it with a fart joke! Even if that is tough to get over, did I mention the gorgeous, photo-realistic animation done by Industrial Light & Magic on their first ever animated flick? This is some of the most stunning animation I have ever seen, it is fluid, and the facial movements are spot on in relaying the emotion. Bravo to ILM!I give Rango an 8 out of 10!",Rango

There are loads of references to classic westerns and one Clint Eastwood tribute that is particularly great.

Animation at its finest this film combines elements of classic Western films with modern day animation and plenty of elements to keep the children in the audience happy. Like most modern animation it combines elements for a more adult audience with elements for a younger audience and it does it very well.The adventures of Rango and the other denizens of the town are a fun story and the way everything comes together is compelling enough to make for a fairly long film - and there's plenty of space to introduce events that mimic other classic films, paying tribute to the better things that film industry has to offer.Very good stuff, 8 out of 10 roads crossed",Rango

Watch it to see how the transformation happens from a lizard to a hero. This brings back the same fun ride that we had in childhood in a much better choreographed way with brilliant animation, sound and video quality but yet it's the same fun. This film reminisces of the West Classics like The Good The Bad and The Ugly and the music for sure will make us recede to those times of Ennio Morricone classic pieces of music.Now the technical part, dialogue is sharp witted and lines of Rango voiced by Johnny Depp are the best ones and the voice is done so well by Johnny who comes out yet again with a performance that is awestruck. The animation of rodents, reptiles and is done well and the textures can be appreciated and the differences too can be figured out there is a lot of detailing that has to be seen and it's a rarity actually for the Non Pixar Animated movies.. Directed by Gore Verbinski who directed the Pirates movies has done this one too with heart and an uncomplicated mind. The screenplay is lethargic at most time echoing most of themes the western classics like brawls between the gun holders, bank robbery etc...This for sure is a movie that is enjoyable if we have time to give for it, but I doubt really how many can invest their time for this tiny Rango It's 3/5.",Rango

No, ""Rango"" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself - as many animals in animated films do these days - thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. But in addition to all its verboseness and abstract homage to classic Westerns, ""Rango"" equally dishes out top-notch physical humor and creative characters for the young ones to lap up, even if they're not exactly of age to, as the film puts at least once, ""ruminate.""",Rango

Ultimately though it was predictable and really kind of slow. I found myself moving around in my seat hoping that it would be over soon. Johnny Depp voiced his usual recent characterization and I have to be honest I getting a little tired of it.

But the problem is that most of the humor is either ""Hey, recognize this reference?"" or the usual anthropomorphism. Look, it's animals doing things you've seen people do. I just didn't think it was funny, nor did the film have much heart to it. When it's not being predictable, it's being obnoxious (don't get me started on the potty humor).

I will not explain further what it is about in order to avoid any possible spoilers, but it is typically 'green dogooder' Hollywood, inserted into the movie without any plausible reason whatsoever other than to subtly impress upon the viewer a political opinion without seeming to be openly doing so.

100,moviemanMA,The Ballad of Rango,10,13 March 2011,"Rango, director Gore Verbinski's (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, The Weather Man) first foray into animation, is a mesmerizing display of both animation and storytelling. We follow a chameleon, voiced wonderfully by the talented Johnny Depp, whose life is turned upside down when he finds himself stranded in the desert. After an encounter with a hawk, our chameleon friend runs into another critter of the desert, a lizard named named Beans (Isla Fisher), who brings the chameleon into town.In the town of Dirt we meet an array of strange looking characters, all of which seem to be confused and curious about this newcomer the chameleon. Now, our friend who remains nameless up until this point, is an actor by trade, though I guess you could call it desire, who is in search of finding his own identity. When approached with the question of who he really is, he quickly comes up with the back story for...Rango.Rango quickly becomes the town's new hero/sheriff. His first task is to settle the unpleasantness surrounding the towns water supply, which dwindles day by day. With the help of Beans and some of the other locals, Rango gets a posse together to find the missing water. Should he fail, the future of Dirt looks mighty grim.This movie had the potential to be a cheesy, kid-joke infused, chaotic romp and a poor excuse of a western. Yet just the opposite happened. The jokes are witty, it is very controlled, and it is an excellent western, certainly one of the best since the millennium. The very opening scene with the soon to be named Rango is so clever and unexpected that I thought Nickelodeon had never even screened the movie before being released. There are so many one liners and visuals that go completely, and I mean completely over the younger audience's still developing head. There are some laugh out loud moments for them, but I don't think they will really understand what is going on for most of the movie.There are guns, explosions, and chases to keep them busy, not to mention a fair dose of falls, whacks, and kerplunks. The kids will be fine. It's the adults that really get to enjoy this movie. I would go so far as to say that adults should call a babysitter to forgo any questions their children might have like, ""Why are you laughing?""Depp's performance, and I do mean performance, is remarkable. My brother said that he didn't even think it was Johnny Depp. Depp, whose face and on screen persona is so hard to dismiss, is hidden well behind the uneven eyes of his reptilian persona. His talents along with the entire cast, whose voice acting turned into real acting behind the scenes (I strongly encourage you all to watch the featurettes online) turned out stellar performances similar to those from Wes Anderson's 2009 masterpiece Fantastic Mr. Fox.Verbinski's animation team deserves a great deal of praise as well. The textures and attention to detail rivals that of Pixar, who invented the process of CG feature films. The landscapes, dreamscapes, and everything in between is second to none. The most important part of the animation and perhaps the whole movie is the work done on each individual face. Each character pops off the screen. Usually such craftsmanship is reserved for the main character, the villain, and a few secondary characters (i.e. Carl Frederickson, Russell, Dug, and Charles F. Muntz from Pixar's Up), but here each character, regardless how much screen time they are allowed, is given their own unique features. It's some of the best animation I have ever seen, and that is not an exaggeration.This tightly woven animated movie is a sight to be seen. Need I forget to mention, you don't have to break the bank to see it in 3D. Would it have looked nice, maybe, but this is sure proof that 2D is alive and well in the land of animated films. Will it fluff up those box office numbers, no, but will it win over the hearts of millions like me, starving for some real good animation outside of Disney and Pixar, you betcha.",Rango
101,blackmamba99971,A real west lizard,10,17 April 2011,"Rango, I really liked this movie. To see a CGI film in the essence of Sergio Leone's western spaghetti style was refreshing. Johnny Depp (Rango) plays a domestic chameleon who is lost during a family trip. Dying of thirst, he befriends armadillo who in turn puts Rango on the path of destiny. Now in a town called dirt, Rango must help the townsfolk of animals to get water back into the town before they all die of dehydration. Yet in the midst of Rango's assured plans, the towns people learn of how Rango is not a gunslinging hero they though he was. Because a snake named Jake (Played by Bill Nighy) told them who he really was. Now all have are becoming victim to the Mayor who is keeping the water under his control. What was a good part was when Rango crossed the highway to meet the spirit of the west who is voiced by Timothy Olyphant. The likeness of Clint Eastwood was amazing, hearing his particular and sage advice given to Rango was fantastic of how a hero does not do the right things for himself, but it is for the people. That is what the hero is. And Johnny Depp was brilliant in giving his performance as the drastic Chameleon who found his calling. Another good scene is when Rango was flying through the air from his family trip and bouncing from car to car including a particular car which was driven by Johnny Depp in another movie called Fear and Lothing in Las Vegas. What a great mixture of delusions adding to the flame of Raoul Duke. The semi autobiography of Hunter Thompson. Recommended film to those who love CGI as much as I do.",Rango
102,diac228,"Zany, trippy, bizarre, unique, and perplexing. But it totally works.",8,7 March 2011,"After an extremely weak first quarter in the cinematic world full of remakes, re-dos, 3-D flicks and movies about gnomes (reallyreally?) we finally have something fresh, original, and quite trippy to kickoff 2011. Once again reaching into his Western roots, Gore Verbinski makes up for what he did to World's End and delivers one heck of an animated film. Rango is full of surprises: surprisingly violent, surprisingly smart, surprisingly full of western references left and right, and with a surprisingly incredible western score that matches that of Ennio Morricone (never thought I'd say that). If you can muster its sluggish start, extremely fast-pace humor and rather bizarre moments throughout, then you will thoroughly enjoy Rango and its Western mayhem. And who said the Western genre is dead....Rango (Johnny Depp) is a chameleon that after a mishap inside his tank comes across a town full of desperation and hopelessness. With a little bit of luck and a lot of lying, Rango becomes sheriff of the town but runs into a lot of trouble when the water supply hits low and tensions start rising. The storyline is nothing new, but the script (Good work John Logan) is full of fresh ideas, fun action pieces, and a great assortment of characters. In the midst of the script lie so many homages and references to classic westerns you can make up one heck of a drinking game.A strong factor into the fun of Rango is the excellent voice acting, which rivals that of Pixar's best casting work (See: The Incredibles and Finding Nemo). Johnny Depp is phenomenal in all his crazy roles, and his performance of the hilarious Rango is nothing short of brilliant. But, let's not forget the great work of Isla Fischer (as the lead female), Bill Nighy (as the sinister Rattlesnake Jake), and the great singing of the owl mariachi (Los Lobos). And speaking of singing, let's talk about music. Hans Zimmer was robbed when Inception didn't win Original Score, but he deserves even more praise with the score here. It is an incredible mix of guitar, strings, orchestra, and nods to masterful Morricone, and is hands-down the best score since Michael Giacchino's ""Up."" I am strongly contemplating buying the soundtrack if it's out in stores.The three main reasons why Rango works: Johnny Depp, Hans Zimmer, and Gore Verbinski. Very few blockbuster directors have the zaniness and range of Verbinski; as his repertoire includes Pirates of the Caribbean (epic blockbuster), The Ring (horror), The Mexican (I still don't know...) and Mousehunt (underrated dark family comedy). His talents can be shown here as he interweaves strange dream sequences with unique action sequences and plenty of hilarious moments. This movie also doesn't hold back for the kiddies, as it has the language, adult dark humor, strong themes, and heavy violence of a good-ol' western. Just picture what were to happen if Chuck Jones directed a tamed Quentin Tarantino script. And Lord knows there is not enough Chuck Jones influence in the modern animated movie world.Bottom Line: Rango works because of its fresh originality and its refusal to follow the clichéd rules of children animated flicks. It ditched the 3-D, ditched the watered-down tone we see all too much, while we experience a very unique take on Westerns while at the same time see plenty of odes and homages to them. The zany edge of classic Warner Brothers doesn't happen enough in this millennium (With Emperor's New Groove being the outstanding example) so its great whenever we see a Chuck Jones-style of entertainment. While the movie is quite gritty for a PG flick and some of its off-color content may throw you off, I am confident when I say that Rango is the first good flick of 2011. Once again Depp, great job. Your career is astounding and even underrated in critical acclaim standards. Zimmer, I think its time to start making an Oscar dedicated to you, because that was quite a musical trip. And Verbinski, I forgive you for World's End.",Rango
103,kdnor2011,"Amazing Animation, but quite a few jokes fall flat",8,12 August 2011,"Rango, starring Johnny Depp, who is probably my favorite actor, is so far the best animated film I've seen so far this year. It's simple, Rango, a chamelion actor tries to cover up the fact that he is a coward by acting tuff in front of the local town of dirt. But he must learn why the water has dried up, and also must avoid the evil Rattlesnake Jake, who will come since the only bird keeping him away has been killed.First off, the film's animation is absolutely amazing, I mean, this matches, it may even outdo Pixar's animation. ILM did this, and man, they really know how to use computers. And I also found myself laughing quite a bit during the film, including a couple of cameos from a movie I haven't seen, but get the joke.However some of the jokes fall flat, they do end up having to use a fart joke, also, it was a little predictable, but only a little bit. Overall, Rango was a great film, but I have to ask one question, this is a kid's movie right?",Rango
104,nickmesafilms,Rango (2011) - Johnny Depp is a Lizard? Are You Kidding Me?,7,18 August 2011,"After years of portraying such wacky characters including Capt. Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka, Sweeney Todd, and Edward Scissorhands, Johnny Depp has brought another excellent performance on the screen in his greatest animated performance since ""Corpse Bride"". ""Rango"" is the story of an outsider, who's a lizard, who travels to the town of Dirt to find water, when accidentally gets a chance to be brave for himself by becoming the town's new sheriff. Along the way, he learns about believing in himself for who he is, and not by his accomplishments. Now, the movie was one of the coolest animated features I have ever seen. I was actually entertained by every single moment that the movie had to offer. Johnny Depp, once again brings another wacky performance of excellence. For his performance as Rango, Depp brought the same type of uniqueness that he brings to all his characters that include: charisma, charm, wackiness, weirdness, and craziness. Also, Isla Fisher, Stephen Root, Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Ray Winstone, and Abigail Breslin brings an excellent casting ensemble that's perfect in every way. Gore Verbinski's direction is top-notch, the wild action is spectacular, John Logan's script is hilarious and beautiful, and Johnny Depp is the 'cherry on top' center of the film, when bringing this magical creature. With a story of a Spanish Wild West mixed with the classic fairy tale, ""Rango"" is a movie that's deserves a great story and brilliant characters, and it never disappoints when you are watching a movie that has Johnny Depp turned into a lizard.

106,zeekwunlau,Who am I ?,7,10 April 2020,"This is a movie suitable for teenagers and adults who are struggling to live in reality.We are all chameleons who love flower shirts, will shed their skin and change color, and are keen to play the heroes.We are greedy for the beautiful mask, and all the glory and enjoyment it brings. We kept changing colors, disguising and dreaming. Facing a thousand kinds of personnel, we have a thousand faces, a thousand forms, and a thousand dreams. We use countless lies and daydreams to weave a grotesque world-a fragile space that is all-encompassing.However, after wearing the mask for a long time, it is not the true face after all. There are too many lies, and you can't tell the truth from the truth. A beautifully crafted false world, no matter how beautiful it is, is ultimately false and unbreakable.Lango 's ivory tower was smashed by a traffic accident, he began to shed skin, began to change color frequently, began to disguise as his envious hero, and began to fabricate a big lie actively or passively; our tumultuous years gradually passed away, as if being stripped We have scars on the shelled shrimp, we are crazy to find new shells, and we gradually become what we once hated.Lango is looking for water, what are we pursuing? Lango found himself on the other side, and we once asked ourselves, who was I?""Regardless of the level of insight, a person can deeply organize his heart, this matter is very charming in itself.""I think knowing who you are, where you are coming from, and where you want to go is the first step on the right track of life. We are not born with the vision to see through the essence of things, nor are we naturally born with the ability to tolerate and accept our own defects and shadows, but at least we should have the courage to dare to see through. Ability can be cultivated, courage, but it is difficult to find it again.Should you be tired of the flamboyant Lango, should you also do it, watching the success or failure, the indignant owl?The story about Lango's opening after he recognized himself was more like another laugh from the director. Is he smart? No. Has his ability greatly improved? nor. Like the first half, his success is basically blessed by luck. Chicken broth has some perspective: Recognizing yourself does not bring a particularly intuitive benefit to life. Work hard on the ground so that this ideological storm will not become a joke.Let's talk about the other characters in the film. The mayor controls everything in the town, and absolute power leads to absolute corruption. If water can make me profit, then I will take it for my own use; if the people issue doubts, then I will make some stupid people's policies; what should I do if I have a prickly head and do not listen? I continue to incite public opinion and let the stupid people isolate you. The trick is pierced? It's okay, I'm violently repressing, letting you a few farts live or die.It is not difficult to find that many townsfolk fell into the trap just at the stage of the policy of stupid people. They have no big ambitions, but only water that can survive. Alive is their only pursuit. The mayor gave them a little sweetness, and they were grateful to Dade and convinced. Lango showed his skill by luck, and they vigorously pursued it.However, life, how uncertain and illusory. Maybe tomorrow will die of thirst? Even if there is water, can you keep your braid up if there is any accident? When the subject of life is left alive, they will lose their basic judgment and thinking, so they support the mayor, so they closely follow the footsteps of Lango and indirectly become the accomplices of the lack of law, the loss of morality, and the family of officials and bandits. , How sad.And who is isolated and regarded as a freak? It is a little mistress who often froze. For her, living is second, and continuing the vitality of her father 's farm is her lifelong pursuit. Although this pursuit seems ridiculous and extremely outdated in the context of the background, compared with the former, the level is much higher.It is precisely because the heroine not only pursues alive, she has a belief or goal more than others, so she first notices the clues of the bank and can see the disguise of Lango and dare to question the mayor. She's so dumbfounded that even though she is constantly derailed from reality, she sees life better than those who are sober all day long.In the chaotic world, there are heroes, bullies, revolutionaries, drifters, and naturally there are water-stealing thieves in the fly camp. But are you too good to condemn them? It's really difficult. In the face of survival, everything has to give in.Let 's not say that the life that ca n't live is suffering. In ordinary life, are we too deceived and squeezed too much, questioning too little resistance? Is it also tempted by fame and fortune to do some things to steal chickens and dogs? Faced with difficulties of all sizes, should we be silent or fight bravely?This is really difficult to choose. After all, I can't wait for a hero without a halo of protagonists, and I can't be a famous hero. However, this does not prevent us from restraining ourselves, seeing things and seeing people better, and being more transparent.""Everyone can't escape their own story.""At first glance, this sentence seems to be talking about the fate we talk about all the time.There is an excuse to say that fate is the weak, and luck is the humble word of the strong. But I am even more convinced that each person is born to have life, to be born to have luck, without distinction of strength or weakness, without distinction of height. Calling it destiny is worse than calling it ego, calling it the ultimate pursuit of the soul. That is the truth that can never be violated. Maybe some people don't know what they are pursuing for the rest of their lives. Or perhaps, many people have pursued too many things, go round and round, but eventually return to the original point.As mentioned above, knowing who you are is the first step in life. With this ability, we can see things around us more macroscopically and more thoroughly, and see the world in which we live. I do not seek to make this world perfect, but I want to live a clear and transparent life, and be worthy of the world. Even if it is ugly and unbearable, we can embrace it as hard as we embrace imperfect ourselves.I love this chameleon.May we all know who we are, where we come from, and where we want to go, may we all embrace the world vigorously, and may we all find our soul in the west.",Rango
107,Eternality,A visually sumptuous film that is undoubtedly an early contender for an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature.,8,13 March 2011,"Is this the first animated Western feature ever made? If it is, it is a commendable breakthrough by Gore Verbinski, the famed director of the wildly popular Pirates of the Caribbean (2003, 2006, and 2007) trilogy. Rango merges the glory of the old Western with the limitless creativity animation offers to give us a visually sumptuous film that is undoubtedly an early contender for an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. Scripted by John Logan, the respected screenwriter of Gladiator (2000), The Last Samurai (2003) and The Aviator (2004), Rango is a story well-told despite its rigid narrative structure.Rango stars Johnny Depp in a quite astonishing voice performance for the title character, who is a chameleon-like lizard that accidentally winds up in a Wild West town called Dirt, an arid land populated by weird- looking talking animals with parched faces who are desperate for water to survive. The egotistical Rango, sensing an opportunity to be a hero, starts to act like one, ""earning"" the respect of the townspeople by telling a fictional story of how he killed seven baddies with just one bullet. He is made the sheriff, a role he is proud to play, as he seeks to investigate the urgent water issue.Rango is the first animated feature created in the studios of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), a company best known to have invented the modern visual effects in the late 1970s. And if this is the standard ILM are setting for themselves, the folks at DreamWorks animation, and to some extent, Pixar would probably be having more sleepless nights than usual. The visuals are stunning to look at, with a more gritty approach favored towards rendering the environment and characters as opposed to the polished look associated with most animated films.With Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men, 2007; True Grit, 2010) serving as a consultant for cinematography, you know better to take Rango seriously. While the story of an outsider arriving in a new town and ends up being the hero is a tad cliché even by Western standards, Rango however imbues in its lead character a waft of eccentricity that plays out humorously with the simple-minded supporting characters that populate the film. Much of the humor is aimed at adults, though kids would be too engrossed in the story to give much thought to some of the film's more offensively hilarious moments.References to the history of cinema have been the staple of a number of Pixar films including Toy Story 2 (1999), and Finding Nemo (2003). In Rango, ILM is no different, channeling everything from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) to Chinatown (1974) to Mr. Clint Eastwood himself. Verbinski's crisp direction allows the action spectacle to be enjoyed fully without half the time forcing viewers to wonder what is going on. There are no problems with the film's pacing, though the final third becomes way too predictable and may cause a fair share of viewers to look at their watches.Rango, even with its flaws, is still an interesting watch, although Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), a quirky and peculiar stop-motion animated feature with Western elements, is a far more effective film. Nevertheless, Rango reminds today's cinema-goers that there is really no need to don 3-D glasses to have an immersive cinematic experience when 2-D animation is just as good, if not miles better.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",Rango
108,rollernerd,A wild cartoon adventure on acid,8,27 August 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the animated family adventure - Rango (2011) directed by Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski and starring the ever versatile Johnny Depp who in this film lends his voice to a sheltered chameleon living alone as normal family pet who is sharing a tank with a plastic fish and a headless torn up doll, his imagination runs through his mind where the world is his stage and goes through many scenes including a Shakespeare scene. Soon his tank crashes into the outside world and his family drives away not knowing what has occurred. Rango, dazed of what has happened encounters a visionary armadillo and finds himself in a gritty, gun-slinging town of Dirt - a lawless outpost populated by the desert's most interesting and whimsical creatures. Accompanied by a quartet of singing owls that represent the Mexican corridos our the less-than-courageous lizard soon understand what it is to be a hero by becoming last hope the town has been waiting for - the new Sheriff. This film has heapssss of pop culture nods to Western movies including the Man with No Name and Blazing Saddles. A great example (**spoilers**), Rango is not his name!! We have no clue as to what his name is which correlates with Mancho or the Man with No Name - a great reference to the classic Spaghetti Westerns to which its inspired by and its Eastwood lead 'Man with No Name' character provides a great quote so the narrative can be unfold ""It's the deeds that make the man...No man can walk out on his own story""-wisdom that helps him confront his circumstances. Depp vocal performance is the main core of the movie as its in between a wacky character and a character trying to find his true position in the world therefore balancing both between energetic and insecure. As the ultimate outsider in Dirt, our lizard hero has an epiphany: he can reinvent himself out here. He takes up his new name and makes up a fantastical tall tale and then with a pinch of luck, becomes the toast of the town and gets anointed sheriff. All seems swell, but something's up in the town with regards to the dwindling water supply and the local critters are getting restless. Rango must step up as the hero he has masqueraded. The animation was fun and eccentric, the story as a whole was engaging not only for the kids but also for the adults as you are introduced to a hot and dry desert where the the sun-bleached landscapes is surrounded with uncanny characters. Its pretty much Looney Tunes on acid - overall very entertaining 8/10",Rango

110,Ryan_MYeah,"Rango is a creative, dazzling, and funny tribute to classic spaghetti westerns, but it's definitely not a kid's movie.",9,11 March 2011,"A couple days ago, I started 2011 off on a solid note with The Adjustment Bureau, but that solid note has now risen to a brilliant note with the release of Gore Verbinski's Rango.Johnny Deep provides the voice of the title character, a chameleon house pet who gets lost in the middle of the Mojave Desert, and through a series of effective fibs, as well as killing a lethal hawk by accident, winds up the sheriff of the town he wandered into known as Dirt, a town low on water supplies, and on the brink of total drought and dehydration. Rango decides to investigate the mystery surrounding the low supplies, and quite often bites off more than he can chew.The direction by Gore Verbinski, who garners enthusiastic and terrific performances from his voice cast, is wonderful, and the screenplay by John Logan pays tribute to the classic spaghetti westerns of yesteryear, right down to pre gunfight stand offs, important events happening at high noon, and the decision to have a Mariachi band narrate, and make comment on the film's events. Sure, a couple scenes seem to overstay their welcome, but in spite of that one flaw, the film is fresh, and funny, and the film quite often got a good laugh from myself. I also loved visual references to characters played by Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.I must also praise the technical crew. This is the first animated feature designed by the legendary special effects company Industrial Light & Magic, and John Knoll does a good job at supervising the film's many grand, colorful and photo realistic images. I have just as much praise for the audio crew. Sound editor Addison Teague does a good job at handling classic western sound effects such as gunfire and galloping hooves, and Hans Zimmer (whose music score pays delightful homage to the scores of Ennio Morricone) does a great job at heightening the excitement and wit.Before I sign off, I must make a final point. I'm normally not too vocal about censorship, but take the facts that the film is animated, and rated PG with a huge grain of salt, because Rango is NOT a kid's movie. The images are quite quirky, and sometimes even trippy, some of the subject material is rather violent and foul mouthed, and some of the jokes may fly way over kids' heads, but that's exactly why I think the film's so special. The film makers stuck to their guns, and didn't wimp out in order to get a bigger audience of children. It's a movie almost strictly for older viewers, and should be treated as such.Needless to say, I loved Rango. I give it ***1/2 out of ****",Rango

112,noahgibbobaker,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one",7,20 August 2020,"I grew up watching rango and I never fully appreciated it. Rango is a funny, well acted, western parody. Rango is one of the most overlooked parodies ever, this film parodies the western genre as well as Shaun of the dead parodies zombie movies or Hot fuzz parodies action films, it hits all the right clichés and makes fun of them in a somewhat subtle way. My favourite thing about Rango is the unique character design that makes you feel as if every single character has had a life just the same as our hero's, the animation is a bit dated in 2020 but it's not distracting. Music is important to me and Rango uses it very well, the score is never overbearing and is used only when it fits, and the licensed songs are also used very well and are very fitting. There are a lot of times where the visual comedy does not work which is a shame as the rest of the film is genuinely funny.I think Rango is a underrated film that I would recommend to everybody.",Rango

And it's nice to see Tim Olyphant NOT play a bad guy for once.However, I hated the first 20 minutes. The filmmakers had no idea what to do with it. It's just Rango doing things.Also, be sure to throw in a cameo from Hunter S. Thompson for all the Depp fans. Don't worry about the kids. They won't know who Thompson is.Depp plays his typical weirdo role and Stephen Root is back once again playing the southern idiot like he always does.Some jokes work and others just make you want a tumbleweed to bounce past the screen.The plot didn't interest me and it has the clichéd ""Lair revealed"" (Yes, I got that from Doug Walker) and the ""Meet the old legend after you've screwed up to give you advice so that you can go back to the town to save the day.""However, some scenes are creative like Rango's dream of cacti turning into snake rattles and how Rattlesnake Jack has a mini gun instead of a rattle.

While the story can stand alone, the more movies and cowboy westerns you've seen, the more fun you'll have watching this because it uses bits and pieces from so many of them to spin a classic story in a tongue-in-cheek way. It's kind of a ""Blazing Saddles"" parody but done with animals in all the roles of a classic western.Well, almost all.A CGI animated version of Clint Eastwood makes a brief appearance driving a golf cart loaded with 4? Oscar statues.The characters the various animals play are all marvelous and distinctive. The computer graphics by Industrial Light & Magic are incredible--the textures of everything (lizards' and snakes' skin, birds' feathers, animals' fur and hair, weathered wood, rusted iron) are extremely realistic.

115,gregeichelberger,False marketing - 'Chinatown' for a new generation,5,2 April 2011,"As much as this film was marketed towards children in its pre-release advertising, it's difficult to comprehend, upon viewing, how this could be so. Gore Verbinski (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series) has crafted a wonderful looking CGI movie here, but those under 10 could never be the intended target of this effort.Plot has a cowardly chameleon (voiced by Johnny Depp) who continues to fantasize about being a hero and rescuing a damsel in distress. Here Depp satirizes his own method acting technique nicely. A minor traffic accident, however, changes his life and he soon finds himself lost in the Nevada desert, alone and nearly helpless.After a great comic experience with a hawk and a horned toad, he soon wanders into the town of Dirt, which is straight out of the 1950s Western movie central casting office. Either as a homage or a poke at such classic films as ""High Noon,"" ""Shane"" or any number of Clint Easwood/Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, the chameleon with no name soon adopts Rango (short for Durango) as his new moniker.Populated by lank and gruff townsfolk (consisting of rats, mice, gophers, opossum, hedgehogs, porcupine, dogs and other creatures), the community is a melting pot of flea-ridden hilarity. Dirt also needs a new sheriff and, after a few funny sequences of Rango besting some bad guys and the ever-hovering hawk (thanks to some remarkable luck), Rango is the clear choice.All is moving smoothly at this point when, suddenly, Verbinski decides this is the time to remake ""Chinatown"" and everything goes South - in a hurry. We're introduced to a new plot of water rights, the town's drought, as well as the Mayor, voiced by Ned Beatty, a direct rip-off of John Huston's Noah Cross.It's amazing how few of those giving this movie high marks fail to see this aspect of the movie. I suppose if one is going to copy a film, though, ""Chinatown"" is not a bad choice, but why then market the picture towards families and - especially - children. The screening I attended was filled with kids and befuddled parents heading toward the exits at film's end wandering what they just witnessed.Vocal talent is extensive, with the aforementioned Depp and Beatty, as well as Bill Nigy, Harry Dean Stanton, Timothy Oliphant, Ray Winstone and Alfred Molina, among others, but the adult-themed plot lines, jokes and even some swear words thrown in make this clearly a movie for those over 14.The animation, for the most part, is intricate and very well done, the script is fine and it's not a bad picture in any sense of the word, but the target audience is what I question. And, as a parent, that would have been nice to know before I brought my young children to it.",Rango
116,theinaniloquent,"""The Name's Rango""",9,18 December 2011,"Rango is an ordinary chameleon who accidentally winds up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West in desperate need of a new sheriff.You can consider me a partial animation movie fan. I LOVE Pixar, I'll settle for some Dreamwork, but all the rest do not grab my interest. So the story begins... Rango, a Nickelodeon movie, firstly turned me off. I didn't follow it around so much until the director was revealed. Gore Verbinski has some intelligent works: Pirates, Ring. With this provided, I had some thought that he could pull of his first animation. And he did... Rango is a western. Believe it or not, the film is presented, moves on like, and overall is a western. The man with ""no name"" (which in this movie has a name; non-cliché) walks into a western town, shakes up some trouble, and the adventure begins. The animation in this film is wondrous. I didn't have the time to see it on the big-screen, but once I feasted my eyes on the brilliant animation, I was in for a treat. The voice acting was obviously wonderful (Johnny Depp!) and everyone else did a fantastic job. The film also had some impressive humor. Seeing as this was PG, I had only small expectations for this, but it blends in adult and child humor together. You will surely be laughing along the ride. In fact, the film gathered nods to modern cinema. You'll have references from Fear and Loathing in Vegas, Star Wars, and even the infamous Clint Eastwood films (especially that ONE scene.) I didn't have too much to complain about in this film, it was highly impressive. Another kudos goes to the wonderful soundtrack. It's adventurous, loud, and surely kicks you into the film. Alongside everything, and combined together: I surely recommend Rango! It's a great family one that everyone will enjoy, and although the film may be classified as a kiddo's film, the film is surely going to surprise you. I give Rango a 9/10.",Rango

118,FairlyAnonymous,An ingenious movie that has a bit more depth than meets the eye,9,17 March 2011,"This is one of those movies that I have been following a while... actually since the very first teaser. This movie is unlike any CGI movie out there, which is what makes it so good. From an outside appearance it may look like your standard CGI movie that is not made by Dreamworks or Pixar. Since it is not made by those two you might exclude it. Don't.The first thing you will notice is how insanely detailed this movie. Literally I have never seen a fully CGI movie as detailed as this movie and I have seen the Final Fantasy movies. It is very beautiful at some moments in the movie, which really gives the movie an artistic perspective. One thing some people have complained about is that the movie has ugly animation. NO NO NO. The animation is not ugly, it's the characters that are ugly. The characters aren't necessarily ugly, but they are so detailed that most people can't stand looking at something realistic.Some people have complained about the movie being predictable. Here is what I have to say: it is predictable plot wise, but character wise it is much different. From the beginning you basically know who the main bad guy is, because there are enough subtle hints. But what makes this movie interesting is seeing Rango change. Rango actually doesn't have a name. Seeing him evolve into the character he wants was pretty neat, and some people think this is a western of Shark Tale. No! This isn't a movie where he kills a beast, so then the townspeople worship him and expect him to do it again. This is a movie where he did something great, and he told everyone he was great before he killed the beast, so then everyone believes him. Nobody really hates him when the find out the truth which I thought was cool. In real life people don't hate you in unrealistic amounts like in other movies. In this movie they feel hurt, but they don't hate him.This brings us to the cast. This movie has a great cast which is what separates it from most CGI movies. Most CGI movies have a couple main characters, and a lot of side characters. In this movie you actually get to learn almost all the names of the townspeople, and get to learn about each of their original personalities. I personally like Spoons a lot and the little mouse girl.The humor in this movie is good. While the movie is rated PG for some rude humor, honestly it isn't that bad. The thing that makes the humor in this movie good is that it isn't emphasizing on the humor. In the one slightly rude/crude moment the scene doesn't dwell on it, but just breezes right by. Sometimes the action in the movie seems a little too light hearted (especially during the bat scene) but most of the action is pretty cool and good.Well there you have my summary of the movie! It is a really good movie that takes a step back from the kiddish movies that are fully CGI and is a movie that older audiences can enjoy. The nice thing is that this movie does have character development, and there is one character that may or may not exist (though the movie never says he doesn't exist, but he seems to appear at weird times) I thought this character was neat because he almost seemed to be in Rango's mind when Rango needed him. Overall a very enjoyable movie that may be a little too mature for kids since the main reason it is enjoyable is because of its story and not for humor.Please watch this.On a side note: If you are a super protective parent than you may not want your kids watching this. There really isn't much swearing compared to other PG movies, and honestly the swearing in this movie was kind of needed to get the right mood. Parents need to remember this movie wasn't made for kids. Just because something is fully CGI does not mean it is a kids movie.",Rango
119,gregking4,wonderfully entertaining animated spaghetti-style western,9,2 April 2011,"The spirit of the late, great Sergio Leone runs through this wonderfully entertaining animated spaghetti-style western. Rango contains the usual archetypes of those classic westerns from yesteryear. Thus we get the corrupt and power hungry mayor; the gunslinger who terrorises the town; the feisty rancher who is trying to hold on to her family farm; and the impressionable young kid holding out for a hero. And of course there is the stranger who comes in to town and becomes a sheriff hoping to clean up the place. But he of course makes mistakes before he redeems himself in the final reel. The only difference between Rango and countless westerns starring those larger than life characters of John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, Gregory Peck and Clint Eastwood is that all of the characters here are lizards, chameleons, rats, snakes and other rodents. Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp) is a lonely pet chameleon with an active imagination who becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert. Barely surviving the scorching conditions and an attack by a predatory hawk, he winds up in the almost deserted town of Dirt. This lawless, dustbowl town is appropriately named as it has almost run out of precious supplies of water. The townsfolk live in hope that some miracle will deliver them vital water. By accident, Rango winds up as the new sheriff, and he takes his new job seriously. He has to protect the town's dwindling supply of precious water from a mysterious thief. He also has to stand up to the town's mayor (Ned Beatty), who has a sinister scheme of his own, and the notorious gunslinger Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy, hissing and slithering brilliantly). The script from John Logan (Gladiator, The Last Samurai, etc) is deliberately full of clichés and clever filmic references that will appeal to older audiences. The subplot involving corruption and water rights smacks of Chinatown, while the comic aspects are reminiscent of Mel Brooks' classic genre spoof Blazing Saddles. Some well-timed musical cues and dialogue riffs will also remind cinema savvy audiences of other classic movies. The director is Gore Verbinski, a former director of commercials who has helmed the successful and lucrative Pirates Of The Caribbean trilogy. He made his directorial debut with Mousehunt, which was essentially a live action cartoon full of pratfalls and slapstick humour. He brings plenty of energy to the material here, and his camera swoops and swirls during the key action sequences. Rango is the first fully animated film from George Lucas' ILM factory, and the CGI animation is spectacular, and every bit as good as the films emerging from Pixar, the undisputed leader in the field. The colours are pristine and vibrant, the quaint and quirky characters well defined, and the film has a wonderful look and texture to it. Veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins (the recent True Grit, etc) had a hand in the striking visuals. This is one animated film that doesn't need 3D to heighten its appeal. Verbinski has assembled a fantastic voice cast to bring the characters to life, and apparently they acted their roles in the recording studio to inject energy and veracity into their performances. The ensemble cast includes Harry Dean Stanton, Alfred Molina, and Ray Winstone, while Timothy Olyphant does a superb Clint Eastwood impression with his cameo as the legendary ""Spirit of the West"". Isla Fisher provides the love interest for Rango as the feisty Iguana Beans. Rango is a lot of fun, especially if you're a fan of western movies! Don't miss it!",Rango
120,robert-710-767167,"Not bad, but could be improved",7,29 November 2011,"The movie itself wasn't bad. Loved the way they portrayed the old west like they do in all the movies. The actors voices were well done, the characters were well made, hats off to the man with no name, he looked super real. And I found that one animal that got run over by the car at the beginning... his face and the way it looks aged with human hair is just.. odd...But anyway it wasn't bad at all, had some humor. I'll admit the scene with the bandits was a little too long for my liking but all in all I enjoyed the plot and the few funny scenes like the bar scene and the scene when he saw the great spirit as well as the ending of course. But the swearing and sexual references were a bit much, yes?Anyway, I'll rated it 7 out of 10.",Rango
121,ArizWldcat,"Dark, depressing, only mildly amusing",3,29 March 2011,"First off, this is NOT a kid's movie and shouldn't be marketed as such. The showing I attended consisted of at least 50% children, and I heard no laughter from them. In fact, I am not sure WHO this is for because the first half of the film d r a a g g g e e e d on and on and on and by the time the action picked up, I really just wanted it to be over. Ugh. What a mess this was. I don't even know where to begin with the criticism.Let's see. First off, a line of dialog says that the setting is the ""Mojave Desert"". As a former (and hopefully future) resident of the Sonoran Desert (which is located in much of Southern Arizona and Mexico)I know for certain that Saguaro Cacti (the tall ones with the big arms) only grow in the Sonoran Desert. Fact check, anyone? Why not be true to your dialog? How hard would it have been to change that line to ""Sonoran""?? And another thing. What the HECK were those animals supposed to be? There was an extremely ugly flob nosed thing...(actually several of them) that was virtually unidentifiable. It had humanoid disgusting yellowed teeth and was difficult to look at. It seemed to me that the animators were trying to create the ugliest, scariest characters they could with no regard to any animal that exists in nature. The Sonoran Desert is FULL of fascinating creatures! Why not animate REAL animals. Study them (as the great animators do) and portray them with their real characteristics. Why on earth, for instance, would you have a venomous snake squeeze its prey? Most 5 year old boys know (and girls too, if they like snakes) that there are two kinds of snakes! Constrictors squeeze, venomous snakes bite! The dialog seems to be aimed at adults, and there were lots of references to pop culture movies (many of them, such as Brokeback Mountain were rated R!) that would just fly right over most kids' heads. My husband and I were bored silly during the first half. I must have checked my watch 5 or 6 times.Don't waste your money on this one. It's a dud.",Rango
122,colinrgeorge,Of (Anthropomorphic) Mice and Men,8,9 March 2011,"Anthropomorphic animals are the bread and butter of the animation industry. Ever since Walt Disney found a cash cow in Mickey Mouse, the medium has tickled audiences with talking critters that span the breadth of the animal kingdom. But Rango, the titular chameleon of Gore Verbinski's cartoon western, is something of an anomaly. The gangly, photorealistic bipedal lizard didn't graduate from the ""Bambi"" school of cuddly creature design. Voiced by Johnny Depp in rare comedic form, the character is defined by beady eyes, a sharply crooked neck, and a gaudy Hawaiian T-shirt.Refreshingly, Verbinski doesn't constrain himself to Pixar's particular reality. The brilliant Disney-owned studio has set the gold standard for computer animation over the last 15 years, capitalizing repeatedly on an effective storytelling formula that put a magnifying glass over insects, fish, and rats, among others. Any of those films could be retitled, ""The Secret Life of _______."" Competitors followed suit, with ""Madagascar,"" ""Bee Movie,"" and a slew of other me-too efforts.""Rango"" turns the overcrowded genre on its ear. Despite being gaspingly more realistic- looking than your average doe-eyed Disney endeavor, Verbinski's flick doesn't stage its critters in a cartoon facsimile of the real world. Instead, the film takes place in some skewed dimension wherein humans exist, but might as well not save for their ever-present eco- footprint. The film is scaled to fit its characters and can't be bothered to stop and explain the origin of its windswept desert town in miniature. It's easiest to think of ""Rango"" as a modern (comedic) western in which the constituent players just happen to be scruffy rodents and scaly reptiles.The world and its inhabitants may be grimy, but what makes ""Rango"" such an endearing experience is its irreverent and offbeat sense of humor. Verbinski, who cooked up the story alongside screenwriter John Logan, borrows a page or two from the Coen brothers; Rango's faux eloquence is reminiscent of Nicolas Cage or George Clooney's character from ""Raising Arizona"" or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" respectively. It shares their dry wit and a surrealist dream sequence reminiscent of ""The Big Lebowski"" too.Those qualities highlight that ""Rango"" is not a movie especially geared at children. From its litany of literate film references including ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Chinatown,"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" to its seriously scary baddies, the film rejects kiddie convention outright. Younger or more sensitive viewers may be frightened by Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), a venomous villain with a six shooter for a tail, and parents might object to the mild swearing.But by my estimate, ""Rango"" is a near-perfect kids' film. Looking as far back or further than the Grimm brothers' macabre fairy tales, the impulse to shield children from potentially off- putting content is a relatively recent development. Verbinski runs the entire emotional gradient here, exploring moments of loneliness and fear as well as adventure and jubilation. Important themes all in the human psyche. Of course, much of the humor will go over the heads of young audience members, but the copious slapstick certainly won't. In the end, it should play well to just about everyone.That is, everyone who's in the market for a conceptually challenging cartoon. ""Rango"" is unwieldy, occasionally unfocused, and also the first great film of 2011. The anthropomorphic animals that comprise its world are less a reflection of the Mickeys, Bambis, and Nemos of years past than of the Waynes, Eastwoods, and Fondas. Verbinski, who famously teamed with Disney for their ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, steps out of their shadow for one of the most clever, fun, and original animated epics of the 21st century. And with the sequel to Pixar's least loved film on deck for this summer, our favorite Hawaiian shirt-wearing Chameleon may need to don a tux this time next year.",Rango

124,maximkong,It is entirely predictable!,3,18 November 2012,"Looks like I have finally found a winner for the Oscars of that year that the awards should reconsider picking. Rango can be summarized in a line used by one of its characters 'its entirely predictable'...and it really is.Looking at modern animation nowadays, i am sorry to say, this cartoon has more clichéd elements and more uninteresting characters that are lacking both in terms of depth and intelligence (seriously, is this how they want to fool the kids? Even though it is just a cartoon?). Also, even with a cowboy theme, it appears quite dead as compared to other real cowboy-theme non-cartoon movies. The score could have been much higher if the film is smart enough to introduce the back stories of the main characters -- who is Rango? Who is the female lead? or the villain? or the Mayor? I have no idea at all.",Rango
125,Semisonic,"Quite chaotic and rather delirious, but still fun",6,20 June 2015,"When we hear about a Gore Verbinski/Johnny Depp tandem, we all know what movie franchise comes to mind first. Pirates of the Caribbean is a huge defining point for both the director and the actor, since the former will hardly ever beat the overall success of it with any other movie, and for the latter his character of Captain Jack Sparrow was, is and probably will stay the most recognizable image he ever brought to life. It's hard to get away from your fame, and it's probably the case when it becomes your curse - just like the Black Pearl's crew was cursed for being too successful at plundering.At first glance, it's hard to imagine anything more opposite to Pirates of the Caribbean than Rango. And not only because it's an animation. Rango is a story of a pet chameleon who's deeply in the hell of a self-identification crisis, and Captain Jack Sparrow would be the last person in the world to question himself who he is. Yet there's a strong vibe of the whole PotC trilogy (to me it IS a trilogy) coming from Rango. The Curse of the Black Pearl was all adventures, Dead Man's Chest was all goofy and slapstick, and At World's End was a rather surreal journey to the other side. And Rango has it all.But in this attempt to transmit the already well-mastered recipe for success from one franchise to another Gore Verbinski chose the second installment of PotC as the base tone. Which is weird, because, apart from being a huge commercial hit, Dead Man's Chest was a rather flat and over-the-top action adventure which, as most second episodes of trilogies do, simply served as a link towards the climactic third act. And while Rango was showing some promise to become a parable of the social inequality, a satire about brainwashing, vice and exploitation, and finally a story of a person on his self-exploring journey, it's still mostly a situation comedy where a striving for local punchlines outweighs a global dramatic effect. Jump funny, say fancy words very fast and make weird noises - and you're good to go. Yee-haw!I guess it's actually enough for the audience that simply wants to be entertained. After all, Rango is beautifully animated, and it definitely delivers a feast for your senses. But for those who prefer to go deeper, Rango could be a much more fulfilling, albeit not so happy, tribute to Johnny Depp's own thespian journey. Rango is a chameleon, an ever-mimicking creature, who has to play a character he invented himself - because he has no idea who he actually is as a person. Just like Johnny Depp himself, who had enacted so many personas during his actor's career that to most people he's just Jack Sparrow or even ""that guy from that movie"". It may be a hymn to the whole tribe of actors, but Johnny Depp is probably the most prominent example of a person who's been in so many pairs of shoes throughout his whole life that it's getting difficult to remember which one is actually yours.The ending, when our hero rides into sunset to solidify himself as an icon to be remembered, is a sort of a silent resignation to this fate. After all, what's the point in trying to define and defend your personal individuality if everyone else will still have his own image of you that's only vaguely related to the reality. Apparently, this choice goes beyond a single film, because in the next work of the aforementioned tandem, The Lone Ranger, Johnny Depp's character is all but a legend alive, with hardly anything truly human in it. Depp may be a most perfect hanger for film personas, but they do start to feel somewhat empty inside. Just like this film itself. But if you're not looking for more than what meets the eye, you'll be thoroughly entertained, because, even though the make-up may be flaking, the smile still stays on. Show must go on, and it will go on. Amen.",Rango
126,blacklist-1,An intelligent animation western that partially fulfilled it's potential.,7,23 March 2011,"Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp) is an ordinary chameleon who ends up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West who are looking for a new sheriff and Rango fulfils that position. The occupants of the town have little water which is obviously essential to their survival and of what there is, is stolen from the bank so Rango with the help of various townsfolk goes to retrieve it back.Overall this is an intelligent movie with plenty of western pastiche and parodies that is referenced. But this is part of the problem, the movie becomes too intelligent and a bit self indulgent in wanting to cram in so many western references and as a result I just don't think this is a movie many kids will enjoy or anyone who has seen many westerns like me. And as a result for me though it was funny in parts and I chuckled now and again there just wasn't enough laughs for me really and it felt dragged out at certain points. At a hundred minutes it was a bit too long. If they cut off ten minutes and included more laughs instead of so many references my rating of this would have been higher. And whilst I'm still going on the negatives you enjoy watching the characters but don't end up emotionally connecting with them not like in Up or in any of the Toy Story films. And it did start off a bit boring and slow. But it does pick up when Rango enters Dirt Town.However at the risk of sounding so negative there was plenty other things in this film that I admired, which made me enjoy it. Though not as big on laughs, the script is witty and crackles with sharpness making it a joy throughout. The voice-over acting was superb across the cast. Johnny Depp was good as the voice of Rango, but the best ones were Isla Fisher as the voice of Beans (who gave an excellent wild west accent) and I really enjoyed Bill Nighy's turn as the voice of rattlesnake Jake. It is superbly well shot and edited by director Gore Verbinski. Surprisingly the action sequences are very entertaining, which did to some extent make up for some of the lack of comedy. But the best thing was the animation, which looked absolutely gorgeous to visualise it, particularly in digital. I also highly admire Gore Verbinski's decision not to add this in 3D, though it can be extremely well done in films and animations like Up, Rango just proves you don't need 3D to enjoy the visual animation. I also like Verbinki's creativeness at trying something different. A western animation as far as I am aware isn't very common, which makes it quite original.In the end though Rango didn't completely fulfil it's potential as it is a bit too self indulgent I enjoyed it thoroughly and can certainly see why this has been such a huge hit with audiences. The 7.8 IMDb rating on here is I feel about right. This is worth seeing if your an adult or have a fondness for the western genre. Rango is overall an intelligent animation that is worth a watch and despite it flaws it deserves high praise and it is one of the most original animations to come out in recent years. Very enjoyable entertainment.",Rango

It was a blast! This movie was a great deal of fun. The jokes all hit the right marks, the story was solid, sweet and not too formulaic, and the visuals were outstanding.There were times that this movie looked 100 percent photo real. outstanding job modeling and texturing and lighting on this. the little tiny attention to detail in the world you guys built had my wife and I in awe throughout most the movie. The animation was fun and eccentric. Over the top but at times subtle and felt meaningful. The only little nit pick was the mouths on some of the characters. in the attempt to make the animals look more like the animals they were representing the mouths were quite small and at times the sync was a bit odd. Though it provided for some goofy looking characters that were fun.at just over an hour and a half, at times it felt it was a little too slow paced. well, that was my wife's critique. I looked at it more so that they were going for the slower feel of some classic westerns. I thought the long stretches of little dialog, epic music and visuals, and great cinematography worked in the films favor.The crowd dug it too. I think the youngest person in the theater was about 6 (which i found odd for a late night screening, but whatever) and the oldest was probably in their 70's and everyone was engaged.I was kind of surprised what they could get away with in a PG rated movie. Im no prude or anything, but there were enough adult jokes snuck in there to give me the giggle fits. Couple of lite swear words, references to more... ehem, adult type themes, but overall pretty tame and enjoyable.Hats off. If this doesn't win awards I don't know what I believe in anymore.

He accidentally ends up in the Mojave Desert at a time where the town of 'Dirt' faces a water crisis. With his good old acting skills and all sorts of made up heroic stories, Rango fits in to the community better than he expected and becomes the new sheriff in town. And as the water crisis becomes worse and the water bank is robbed the duty calls for desperate actions from his part. Now he has to capture the water thieves and a reveal a plot behind this all to control the water supply of Dirt in order to control power.The quality of animation is commendable. It starts pretty decent and then ends up being quite extravagant. The whole wild west look and feel of the movie get a good boost with the music and the story telling set of owls appearing here and there with some good lines.The plot is itself is quite creative.

Lets make all the supporting characters very odd animals with weird character traits and deformities, all highlighted with hyper realistic animation. Oh and lets make one of the characters have an arrow through his eye, in place for most of the later scenes.Somebody at the back might also add, lets remove most of the humour and have some very odd lines - ""I found some human spine in my fecal matter"" and lets make the theme of the plot something only adults might even begin to comprehend.Lets get some things straight, the animation, voice work and characterizations are a joy. But and this is a massive but, who is the film aimed at. It would be financial suicide to make an expensive animated film about strange animals just for adults, wouldn't it? The whole film is peppered with surreal moments but involves a chameleon attempting to save a town from assorted bad guys voiced by Bill Nighy and Ned Beatty. This all transpires in the town of ""Dirt"", a spaghetti western town with no water, apparently exclusively populated and terrorized by characters straight from ""Deliverance"", the animated version.We have mystical surreal sequences, very long words, high decibel classical music (Ride of the Valkyries), an owl Los Lobos group and plays within plays.

133,wandereramor,"You WILL believe that Johnny Depp is a lizard, in case you didn't already.",7,2 September 2012,"Rango isn't a Pixar movie, but it feels like it may as well be -- state-of-the-art animation, playful creativity, overheated critical praise up to and including having an Oscar for Animated Feature in its best pocket more or less since release, a remarkable first act, and a surprising reliance on the usual plot outlines and conventions of children's movies.Rango uses the formula of the oddball pretending to be a hero, and if you've seen one of these movies (Dumbo is perhaps the most archetypical) you'll be able to see every beat coming from a mile away. But the journey is enjoyable and has some pretty amazing setpieces, which I won't spoil here. It also has a decidedly cynical sense of humour which is only eventually muted in the formulaic climax.The computer animation is top-notch, rendering a nigh-photorealistic desert and some gorgeous water effects. The distinctly odd character designs show more personality and are less realistic, which was probably a good decision. As the requisite big name star without voice acting experience, Johnny Depp gives a hyperactive and schticky performance that doesn't really suit the character. The rest of the cast acquits themselves much better, with Isla Fisher and Ned Beatty especially standing out.There's a tendency to grade these films on a curve: American critics expect little from animation and kid's movies, so when there's something of merit they overreact. The truth is, the bar has been raised for animation (and children's cinema, for that matter) a long time ago. Rango doesn't surpass that bar, but it more or less meets it. It's a formulaic diversion, but one with a lot of great moments and more than a bit of an edge to it.",Rango
134,MovieProductions,"Smart, witty, satirical, hip, ""Rango"" is a hit",7,7 March 2011,"*** out of (****)After the plethora of abysmal, Hollywood-glossed 3D animation productions, I thought a sleeper hit of such genre would never make its comeback. Boy was I wrong. Rango is an oddball of a movie, a hipster one you could say. It's an animated film that hits all the right notes, and hits those notes hard. Pixar has definitely got competition on their hands. For once, a kids film isn't in the third dimensions. Don't get me wrong, the fad played its course, and I had fun with it, but 3D has overstayed its welcome a bit. What next? ""Precious 2... in 3D!"". However, regardless of what reviewers say, this film isn't certainly for everyone. In fact, I hardly think this is a kids movie. With subtle sexual one-liners, and bits of profanity sprinkled here and there, it seems more mature. Not to mention its sophisticated, dry-pan humor. However, if you get this film, it's just all that much better. And apparently, most people got it.Rango revolves around the namesake protagonist who has been escorted from a vehicle, and has his feet planted on the other hot, western part of the city. There, Rango tries to assimilate in his new place by becoming a hero. However, the city is suffering from a drought, and Rango may have a few obstacles in his way. Can Rango still be a hero? Will the drought be gone? Will the townspeople have someone to count on?Yes, I'm fully aware you can answer those questions faster than Lindsay Lohan can try to cover up her sanity, but this film isn't about the twists and turns. It's about the ride. Let's talk about acting chops. Everyone here is exceptional in their role, especially Depp. Depp just has that charisma and undeniable wit, which makes his character that much stronger. Fisher can sass and charm into just about anything. She's definitely something. As for the rest, they play their characters respectively well. I'm not one to complain. Furthermore, the script is very hip. The jokes are very intelligent, hit every demographic, and pull a strong punch. To put the cherry on top, on a technical level, ""Rango"" shines. The animation is just so immersing, and I can slip into the picture. Also, I love just how much fun this movie is. The western vibe, the slick action, the line delivery of jokes. It's just all good.While this is a fine piece of filmmaking, there's a few bumps in the road. For one, the movie takes a while to get going. The opening twenty or so minutes is just very dry and ""Rango"" doesn't find its footing. It does when its about mid-way, but picks up momentum as it progresses. Furthermore, I think the film tried too hard in some areas, and too little in others. Also, is it just me or is this movie long? I enjoyed the film but my god, it just never ended. There were at least four times I thought it would end, and there'd be ten more minutes.All in all, ""Rango"" is an odd fellar. It has some gaps to fill, but the ride is still moving. It's entertaining, fresh, cool. Seek out a matinée, at least. Even if the film doesn't quench your acquired taste, the technical aspect of it certainly will. Smart, witty, satirical, hip, ""Rango"" is a hit.",Rango

136,bjones,Hit that's amiss,6,9 March 2011,"I began to like the film right away. I was expecting to be delighted with all the amazing animation greatly enhanced by the stellar cast and a funny and heartwarming story. The opening scene with the adorable owls promised something good to come. I settled down in my seat and cracked open my large bag of Corn Nuts. The introduction of the title character, Rango the Camelion, followed suit. The poor little guy was suddenly ripped from his imaginary idyllic environment with the humans and thrust into the grave dangers of the real world. Then something happened. Thump. The film that had started out like Bullet Bob Hayes running a down and out then, unfortunately, slowed down like an old man out for a 50 foot jog in the park.As the film meandered along it became increasingly hard for me to maintain interest. That surprised me coming as it did from the same people responsible for a number of great action films. Maybe story boarding may have helped. Maybe having a bit of assistance from someone – anyone – more experienced in creating animated films may have helped. Perhaps they felt Pete Docter was too pricey. Having no one was more costly yet.Speaking as a trained artist, the animation itself is a masterpiece of the genre. At times, it's hard to believe some of the things you are seeing on screen are animation; it's that realistic. That was the best saving grace of the film, it gave me something of considerable interest to study during the too frequent sluggish stretches.I expected some visually stunning characters coming from the genius of Industrial Light and Magic. I was to be disappointed. I got the feeling that no one was in charge of the store, so the employees were skateboarding down the aisles.The ""star"" of the trailers and the film is a quirky chameleon. That would make one expect some similarly adorable co-stars. Not so much. Whoever was responsible for character design seems to have come from a dark place they shouldn't have left.Virtually none of the films characters, except for perhaps the mariachi owl quartet, are what one could call endearing enough to make action figures from. I get the feeling the designers thought they were creating characters who would be offbeat in a quirky, oddly funny sort of way. Instead, they created an ensemble for a theater of the bizarre, unsightly bordering on the grotesque. A film peopled with a few such characters can be interesting for the counter-point they often times offer. But having all the characters like that is just uncomfortably unsightly. Compounding the felony, they chose for the film's setting one of the more unappealing areas of the world; the sparsest parts of the Southwestern American desert. I understand that they felt it gave some degree of credence to the single plot element. In retrospect, they may have been better served, and in so doing better serve the filmgoing public, by having a look at how-to-write-a-book-now.com and then develop a plot set in a more appealing area of the world.Some of the character's disquieting appearance might have been counter-balanced by other endearing qualities but, alas, such was not to be.Beyond their appearance, the Western accents the actors tried to emulate with most of the dialog fell short of actually being intelligible in places. One might tend to blame that sort of studied mumbling on the actors going a smidgen too far in trying to satirize those sorts of characters; but I'd lay the blame on the director's doorstep as it's his responsibility for that sort of thing appearing in the film. In any event, it fell flat. Perhaps it'd be better with subtitles.The actors, without exception, turned in solid performances. Johnny Depp was in fine form as the title character's voice and complimented by Isla Fisher as the the strange lizard girl afflicted with petit mal seizures. Ned Beatty, Abigale Breslin, Timothy Olyphant, Alfred Molina and Harry Dean Stanton contribute their usual quality work. And, lets not forget Bill Nighy as the nasty snake. But for all their effort one cannot get past the meager material they're given to work with. Listening to them deliver the material is better than the overall film.I had the nagging feeling that this film developed with a few well-meaning guys over a couple of beers who had worked together before and thought their little joke was hilarious and then muscled the funding for this as some sort of requite for previous successes. That thought congealed with recognition of scenes that appeared to have been designed for 3D. The fact that the film is not in 3D may be a tacit admission from the makers that they are aware they missed the mark with this one.Lastly, there's a sparsity of elements to hold the attention of children; who are usually the target demographic for animated films. There were children in the theater and I could tell they weren't entertained by all the noise they were making.By Bruce L. Joneshttp://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",Rango
137,Criticman12,Industrial Light and Magic's first animated film is a blast,10,12 March 2011,"Pixar and Dreamworks has given us many great animated films like, ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"". But special effects company, Industrial Light and Magic, and POTC director, Gore Verbinski, teamed up to make an animated movie. The result: ""Rango"". A fun animated film.I enjoyed every moment in this film. Johnny Depp does a great and funny job as the titular character, Rango. Timothy Olyphant does a great job as The Spirit Of The West (He is also a reference to, ""The Man With No Name"", character). Bill Nighy does a nice job as the evil, Rattlesnake Jake. What really make's this movie really great, is the animation. It feel's like a live-action movie and it was all done by ILM. Not only it had impressive animation, but it was really funny.Overall, if you're looking for a good animated film to watch, ""Rango"", is worth watching.",Rango
138,japamo,"Nondescript Chameleon Stumbles into his Karma in the Shabby, Parched Satirical West – Some Random Remarks",7,11 March 2011,"1. The above is one synopsis of ""Rango""'s plot.2. Speaking of which, will Culture Club's ""Karma Chameleon"" make it onto the soundtrack?3. Some moviegoers will have a blast spotting the cornucopia of movie references ""Rango"" throws at us, particularly ""Blazing Saddles"". The Star Wars Tatooine saloon scenes, ""The Road Warrior"", ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", and even ""Kung Fu Panda"" also come to mind. However,there is another movie from which ""Rango"" borrows its premise which I bet nobody ever considered: ""Flushed Away"" (except the danger there is too much water, not the lack of same). Check it out on IMDb, and you'll see why.4. If you have young children, instead of ""Rango"", where they'll probably fidget, yawn, and whine, take them home and pop SpongeBob Squarepants's ""Pest of the West"" episode into the DVD player instead. Same boisterous ""Rango"" premise, but much more attention-grabbing.5. In that vein the PG-rating is too lenient. I would elevate it to PG-13 for mature themes, killings, scatological humor, and risqué references. Smart, sophisticated, irreverent moviegoers who appreciate intelligent, polysyllabic, sizzling word play will probably get the most out of ""Rango"". Stoned people, too, though of course I don't advocate this. It will probably be extremely popular at college campus film festivals in the near future.6. Most of the time, Sheriff Rango (Johnny Depp) seems to channeling the late Don Knotts's Barney Fife, or Knotts's character in ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"".7. Yep, the cinematography is even more realistic-looking than that of ""Wall-E"".8. With its menagerie of mangy, unsightly desert critters, ""Rango"" seemed to be shooting for a gross-out ""Ren and Stimpy"" or ""The Misadventures of Flapjack"" vibe.9. I went to see ""Rango"" with my mom. She liked ""Rango's"" theme of ultimately accepting responsibility. ""But, Mom"", I said, ""you were asleep for half the movie!"" ""That's okay, I was awake for the climax (the showdown with Rattlesnake Jake), the important part."" 10. By the way, Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) was my favorite character in the movie. Imposing, malevolent, intimidating, he was like a venomous anaconda. Ironically, he humiliatingly and mercilessly exposes Rango's phony lawman stunt and forces him into temporary, suicidal exile, where he has an epiphany.11. As for the gigantic eye in the tunnel, it was either a heat-induced hallucination or a reference to the 1998 version of ""Godzilla"".12. Now, did I enjoy the movie? Generally, I did because it was ambitious, whip-smart, engrossing to look at, and lively. However, it was also derivative, meandering, a bit self-conscious in its humor, and sometimes difficult to hear. Still, it was worth the $6.25 I paid.P.S.: I think Rango should team up with the gecko in those Geico commercials.",Rango
139,rdukeesq,liked this film but then again i am in it,7,7 August 2011,"So I watched Rango from 2011 and starring Johnny Depp. So was this movie good, I say yes you bastards, sorry I tend to curse when I channel the voice of Dr. Duke. I am perhaps a little bit biased in my assessment of this film, I do have a very brief cameo in it. Look for me in the beginning I am driving the Cadillac with my lawyer in the back seat. This is a kids film, but fortunately it is one of those films the adults can enjoy as well (the fact that I am in it should tell you that). The story is very predictable and has been done a million times in a million movies. We have a fish out of water (well lizard), who pretends to be something he is not, gets caught eventually, but comes back to both redeem himself and save the day and of course gets the girl. However, it is the original take on this premise as well as the subtle deeper thoughts that this movie touches on that makes it good. It also is one of the most beautifully animated films I have seen yet. I heard this movie is spectacular in 3D, which is something I would not doubt. So this movie is well shot, well written, and well acted, it has great and original characters, and in general is really good for a kids movie. I will say this critters die in this flick something I was not expecting in a kids movie. But then again it is not graphic and we are talking about birds and other such critters so unless your kid doesn't understand why grandma can't come over for the holidays anymore, don't worry about your kids watching this film. Most people should enjoy this film it is very enjoyable on many different levels and as I said visually stunning. So go watch enjoy whatever your personal movie preferences are. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Rango
140,DonaldDooD,"Great Animation, Little Point",5,30 August 2014,"Rango's animation is perfect for a western world (with animals). And from a distance, the characters seem interesting. Too bad there's little payout from this film. It succeeds as a homage to westerns, but there's nothing to really take away from Rango. Our main character's story has been done dozens of times, and nothing new is brought to the table. His relationships are quite weak, even with his love interest. If there is any moral at all to the story, its modern society sucks, the wild west rocked? Alright.Other pet peeves include A. Some dumb jokes made by bit characters B. Lack of a satisfying fight with Rattlesnake Jake. C. A cop-out ending.Okay, its not that awful. Some of the action scenes are a lot of fun. And again, the animation is great. It may not be a bad way to pass the time. But if you are looking for character and plot, I find Rango very hard to defend.",Rango
141,AzSumTuk,Great...,10,13 September 2011,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This is what any family movie is supposed to be - a movie that can entertain an adult as well as it can entertain a kid. There is a great story. There are great characters. There is great animation... Well, you get it. I am probably going to write about it in details after I write the things that I started writing this review for.Now...Well, as I've said, this is a great family movie. Really. Kids enjoy it. Adults enjoy it. However there is surprisingly huge amount of reviews and comments written by people who think this movie is somehow inappropriate for kids. Some people think it is heavily loaded with extreme violence, heavy profanity and a lot of references to nudity. I would like to respond to those people.First, about the violence... People, what world have you been living in? Seriously... What is your kids' favorite fairy tale? Is it the one about the wolf who eats a little girl and her grandmother and then gets violently killed? (Little Red Riding Hood) Or may be it is the one about the evil queen who sends her step daughter to die in the forest and then tries to kill her many times? (Snow White) Or about the woman who treats her step daughter like a piece of cr@p and then forces her real daughters to cut their toes off? (Cinderella) Or may be it is one of the thousands fairy tales about The Brave Hero who slays many enemies, kills anyone who stands in his way, etc... And what is your kids' favorite cartoon? Is it the one about the mouse who likes hitting the cat with a frying pan or other weapons of this kind so hard so the cat would surely die if it weren't a cartoon? Or may be it is the one about the carrot-eating rabbit who likes to do similar things to the hunter? Or... Whatever, you get the point. 'Rango' isn't more violent than any of these cartoons and fairy tales. If you or your kids have any problems with the violence in it then you are just insane.Second, about the profanity... I am not going to write much about it. All I am going to say is that if you feel offended by words like ""hell"" or ""private parts"", then you might find this movie filled with profanity. That is about the heaviest language you would hear in it, and it is not used in the context that would make it sound offensive. Nothing more. Nothing your 2+ year old kids haven't heard in the kindergarten. If you have problems with it then you are just insane.Third, about the references to nudity... Yes, there are a few. Rango talks to a broken Barbie doll and asks her one question. That is it. Oh, yes, and one character says something about some fruits. Nothing heavier than Daffi Duck's whistling after any beautiful girl he sees.***Now I want to write a few words about the movie itself. First, the quality of the animation. Six words - the best I have ever seen. Seriously. Everything is so amazingly detailed so it looks REAL... I wouldn't say it is the most beautiful because beauty is a very subjective thing but the details are...Second, the story and the characters. 'Rango' is some kind of a ""multi-layered"" movie. You can see it as a homage to various movies. You can see it as a movie about finding yourself. You can see it as a satire of the actors' work. And would be right about everything. The characters are exactly what they have to be. I don't want to spoil the movie so I would not write a lot of details but... Well... Every single character is important to the story, including the owls with the music instruments that you saw in the trailer. Every single character is an individual and not a simple plot-device. Every single character is great.The music is great too.10/10.",Rango
142,Animated_Antic,"A very strange, but still amusing animated movie.",9,4 December 2018,"I've seen a lot of strange animated movies as a critic. Sometimes they are strange in the right way and sometimes they are strange in the wrong way. If there's an animated movie that can certainly fit into being strange, it's ""Rango"". This is such a weird movie and it has a very interesting crew. It includes director Gore Verbinski who made it fresh of his endeavor of directing the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy, Oscar nominated screenwriter John Logan, animation from special effects company Industrial Light & Magic, and also having it released by Nickelodeon Movies. This is such an odd combo for an animated movie, yet I still found myself oddly enjoying this film. It's a very weird film without a doubt, but if weird is done right I find myself enjoying it. This was a film I did end up finding myself enjoying.After a pet chameleon (Johnny Depp) becomes stranded in the Mojave Dessert in Nevada, he then is sent on a journey to a dried up town called Dirt. There he is seen as a stranger by most of the town folks, including an iguana named Beans (Isla Fisher), but quickly comes up with a fake story about being a drifter and taking out the Jenkens brothers with one bullet. He also gives himself the name of Rango. After accidentally killing a hawk that was terrorizing the town, he is then made the town sheriff by the mayor (Ned Beatty). There is a problem in the town of Dirt though, but it doesn't have to do with any outlaws. The town is running quickly out of water. After their last few water supplies are stolen by the town, Rango organizes a posse to help get the water back to the town of dirt. From there, some very strange and weird events occur that would take me a while to explain.This certainly was a strange movie to watch, but I still had a fun time watching it. The story certainly was probably the oddest part of the film. I think the best way to describe the film is a very bizarre Western and yet John Logan's script really does make it work. It kept me very intrigued and had some quirkiness in it. Even though it does have tropes and cliches that have been done hundreds of times in the past and will be done hundreds more times in the future, they still seemed to be very fresh and new here in this film. The animation was really amazing. This is some of the most beautifully crafted CGI I've seen, then again when you have the Oscar winning effects studio who brought to life special effects for hundreds of live action films like ""Star Wars"", you know it'll be good. The dessert animation felt so dry and empty that it left me parched by the end of the movie. Watching this movie thirsty made me regret not seeing it without a glass of water nearby. I needed one badly by the end of the movie. As for the characters, I'd say they have some of the quirky charm to them. Rango does start off as a character you don't like at first, but you start to eventually warm up too. Though it's really Beans that is the character that I liked the most in the movie. She definitely has a strong attitude towards her and is a little rough at times, but she still has a good heart. She also isn't yet another damsel in distress and can stand up for herself. Even her odd defense mechanism was amusing. Although I did like this movie, it does have some flaws. For one, the beginning is a little boring and does take time to get fully invested in. Also, the ending of the movie was so abrupt that I didn't exactly like how it finished. I felt that there needed to be one extra scene added to give the film a proper close, but sadly we didn't get it. It did leave me feeling a little disappointed.Still though, I did find ""Rango"" amusing enough. The story is weird but still interesting, the animation was certainly fantastic, and the characters were amusing and had some fun quirks to them. I do recommend this movie, though I will say this. If you're seeing it for the first time, have a glass of water near you. Unless you want to be extremely thirsty by the end of the film after looking at dry dessert for nearly two hours, you're gonna need it throughout your viewing.",Rango
143,CelluloidDog,Brilliant Animated Film Draws References from Classics,9,16 July 2011,"Most animated films are made for families and children but here we see a rare film that almost falls into the art film category. Rango is a perverse, philosophical tribute to movie- making which can be difficult to comprehend. The references to other films requires viewing this gem several times but the humor can be a bit too sophisticated or vulgar for some. It's an existential film about chameleon finding who he is, if he is the hero and whether he has an identity in the old west, much like the Man With No Name, a tribute to Sergio Leone's films.The film is rich with references to other films. For example, some people point out the Ride of the Valkyries in the canyon with the bats as a tribute to Apocalypse Now or Ned Beatty's mayor is a tribute to Chinatown and the little girl who always asks questions is remotely similar to a character in True Grit. The tower in the town is a bit like The Quick and The Dead (which had the woman with no name seeking revenge as in Once Upon a Time in the West). The reference to water and control is clearly from Dune, another movie where water was a central theme (He who controls the water or ""spice""...)...and the walking cactus in the desert are reminiscent of the worms as well as water everywhere in the end...We get hints of the philosophy of the film when in the beginning, we realize our protagonist is a lonely, nerdy chameleon who first runs into the question of why did the armadillo cross the road. The Spirt of the West lies on the other side (and we later see he's incredibly close to a screen legend without a name). The alabaster carriage and golden guardians turns out to be hilariously something familiar to us (hint: Oscar and Clint). The dream images are like Native American soul-searching with the Great Spirit. And the image of the earth bugs carrying away Rango to the distant future might be a reference to visions of death, perhaps a bit as in Gladiator.Industrial Light & Magic did a brilliant job of animation with the details of shadows in the town and the desert panorama. The rich close-ups of the animal characters is a bit disconcerting. I love the rabbit with one ear or Spoons, the white rat with the strong cowboy accent. The close-ups of the ugly characters is a tribute to Sergio Leone who loved to zoom in on eyes and facial skin cracks. Perhaps the most film references, however, as to Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. We see Rango's mayor is a cripple like OUTITW's Morton who competes with Jake the Snake (Henry Fonda). The black hat might be Lee van Cleef but easily Fonda's Frank. The scene in the bar where Rango finds his name is clearly a reference to OUTITW when Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain) meets Charles Bronson (Harmonica) and Jason Robards (Cheyenne). Lionel Stander's bartender was copied by the toady barman. The mayor makes references to the future, buying the ranch (owned by Beans who even has red hair like Jill McBain) and that Jake isn't a businessman but the last gunslinger is a reference to Once Upon a Time in the West....the characters and lines are quite similar. The drink sliding across the bar in the shadows was a reference to Cheyenne sliding the gun across to Harmonica. There's an interview by the visual effects director who actually mentions the numerous references and modeling after Once Upon a Time in the West. That movie, consider by many the greatest western ever made, was a tribute to many westerns that came before and also copied the classic westerns.This film is clearly for the film buff, but not necessarily for everyone. It's a rich comedy that has the depth of The Seventh Seal, Citizen Kane or 8 1/2.",Rango
144,MsMovie,Not suitable for kids under 7 in my honest opinion!,4,6 March 2011,"I went to see this movie under extreme protest and it was OK - I didn't like the type of animation used, nor the western theme, but it had an OK story and even though it was pretty formulaic I can certainly see it appealing to a certain type of audience.I have to say a lot of the themes, language and jokes were simply not kid friendly at all - I had little kids with me as it was only PG rated and they were really, really bored by about 45 minutes in. Two of them actually left with their parent and I saw a lot of other parents with small (toddler - Kindergarten age) kids exiting about an hour in.So, this movie won the box office for sure this week, but I think a lot of parents who waited will not want to go next week when they talk to their friends who will say it is definitely an older kids movie - I'd say honestly 8-10 and upwards.I think this was a solid entry into animation for the director who may be carving his niche by the way his movies are animated - it's not pretty animation, it's not at all cutesie - personally I found it very unappealing visually. But, Tim Burton makes movies that are equally unappealing to me that are loved by his solid core of fans - I think this would appeal to Tim Burton fans a lot.All in all, not an enjoyable movie experience for me - I felt like the plot was a little thin and by the end of the 90 or so minutes I was SO glad it was over.I can't wait for Cars 2 to come out in May - now that movie will appeal to me visually - I'm a Pixar groupie, no wonder this one wasn't my style really.Read some of the other reviews on here, but heed my warning - don't take your under 8's - their whining when they are bored gets very tedious!",Rango

146,jonnyhavey,Chameleon: Action Masking Symbolism,8,16 March 2011,"""Rango"" is a throwback to the 1950s western genre with a twist. The John Wayne of the film is a chameleon. This unlikely hero creates a modern, adult, animated, western flick of fun and depth with the help of director Gore Verbinski (""Pirates of the Caribbean 1-3"") and Johnny Depp (most recently ""The Tourist""). Depp and Verbinski have teamed up before in the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and are back with their best flick since ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". Depp voices Rango, a lost chameleon who is lost in the middle of the wild west after being thrown out of his secluded life as a pet lizard from the back of a moving car. Rango finds himself in the town of Dirt that is looking for a hero. The town is synonymous with any beaten down town in classic western cinema. The town is desperate for a source of water and protect from Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I""). The Mayor (Ned Beatty, ""Toy Story 3"") is doing everything he can, but even he cannot stop the over powerful force of urbanization as the classic cow town fades away. Rango joins locals Beans (Isla Fisher, ""Confessions of a Shopoholc"") and Prisicilla (Abigail Breslin, ""Little Miss Sunshine"") and others to find the secrets behind the water shortage in the town while unmasking the spiritual truth behind the film rebirthing the magic of the Wild West.""Rango"" is not just another animated film concerning a childish plot and overused 3D animation. While 3D has literally taken animated films to another dimension Verbinski decides to bypass it and stick with a more rugged 2D look. ""Rango"" targets adults and features many metaphorical and symbolic moments alongside brilliant action sequences. The film contains one of the best animated action sequences ever created along with one of the greatest almost cameos. Rattle Snake Jake is also one of the greatest animated villains ever created. Depp's character Rango is also very well characterized fitting into the cowboy hero stereotype with a little modern flare. His monologue at the beginning of the kicks off his character's development along with exemplifying the dark undertones of the well written script accompanied by some singing birds. ""Rango"" inserts modern concerns and ideologies into the west reaching a wide range of viewers.This is a film that the audience has to seek out and give a chance and in order to get anything out of it. It is a hard film to read and is meant to be invested in, instead of grasping the viewer. Therefore, this is not necessarily the best film for kids to watch and should be looked at as a more mature film because of its symbolic subject matter. Also, there is some empty space on the open range in slow sequences leading the slightly film off track. Also, the cameo is fake and even though it is meant as a joke, come on! ""Rango"" is ""Shane"" meets ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" released in an era dominated by animated films reliant on the beauty of color and special effects. Not to say that recent animated movies are bad, ""Rango"" is just original and different. It is early to make too many predictions, but ""Rango"" may be showing up again next February",Rango

However, I was surprisingly impressed by the oddness of it all.""Rango,"" a film clearly more directed at adults more than children, is an amusing look at a chameleon named Lars who is mistakenly dropped off a car in the middle of the desert who finds himself in Dirt, a stereotypical Western town in the middle-of-nowhere. Fearing the lawlessness of the town, a convenient lie enraptures Lars in a heroic quest to find water for the town before it dries up completely after a faked act of heroism leads the townsfolk to believe he is Rango, fearless and worthy of being town sheriff.After a few missteps by Johnny Depp, who voices the titular character, he finally found an entertaining way to deliver his almost-too-obvious quirkiness of late.Still not on the level of some of the great animated features of the last twenty years, ""Rango,"" which won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, is definitely the best offering the genre had to offer in 2011. Hell, if it won this Western-hating sceptical over, John Logan's script must have done something right, if not Gore Verbinski's wonderful direction.",Rango
148,garyvanhorn,Masterfully animated feature that is sure to delight both young and old.,9,26 July 2011,"Rango is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. Johnny Depp is stellar as the naive and eccentric chameleon that is lost in the desert and trying to find himself. The animation is second to none, at times it seems completely real, an amazing feat considering the characters are all anthropomorphic animals. The characters, the voice acting, the story; everything falls together perfectly to create a wonderful film.Rango (Johnny Depp) is starving artist chameleon, always performing for an audience of one (himself) in his safe, yet boring, fish tank. He has no real idea who he is or what his purpose in life should be. His life is turned upside down when an accident leaves him stranded in the middle of the desert where he meets a cast of crazy spaghetti western characters in the frontier town of Dirt. Dirt is a rough and tumble town that is facing a drought and a series of quirky misadventures leads to Rango becoming the new sheriff. Of course there are outlaws to be captured, corrupt officials to be stopped, and a woman to win, all staples of the romantic American western.The creative energies that were obviously poured into the film really pay off, Rango is funny, polished, and vastly entertaining. There is enough silliness to keep children interested, yet there is always a serious overtone that keeps adults engaged and the plot moving along. Don't let the fact that Nickelodeon was involved, this isn't your average kid's movie, it's much, much more.",Rango
149,montera_iulian,It seems like studios found again a great chance of covering the defunct storytelling with mesmerizing visuals and impressive editing.,7,3 March 2011,"Every film product must satisfy it's audience. Since we're talking about an animated film, the goals are harder to obtain simply because you must project a rich and attractive story filled with funny moments and a detailed animated world. We've seen animated movies made for a smaller audience like, for example, The Illusionist from last year, which addresses adults and not underaged idealists. Rango is a movie for all ages because probably everyone will have a good time watching it. But having a good time watching a movie describes how good the movie really is?... Is Rango that good? The western adventures of the simple and clumsy lizard Rango (Johnny Depp) borrows elements from Leone's classic westerns, refurnishes the set-ups, creates a comfortable world for the viewer and starts to convert the old-fashioned western story. While it may be remarkably smart written, the story is dragged around the biggest clichés in animated films. We all understand Rango is a perfect reason to pay homage to one of the greatest eras in film history, however, was it necessary to offer a predictable and pointless story? The lonely guy (or lizard in this case) with no friends and no actual talents whatsoever, integrates in a community (Dirt Town) threatened by an oppressive ruler (The Mayor) and becomes the local hero by luck and chance while defeating a local villain. After a short period of popularity he loses all the credibility and affection by getting engaged in a duel with the big villain (in our case, the town's mayor) which unveils his true face and forces him leave his people with his tail behind his legs. But somehow, in the middle of nowhere he finds hope and courage with the help of some unusual force and decides to go back to his people and free them from the oppressor because that's (obviously) the right thing to do. Wait... I'm hearing some of you interrupting me ""Will he get the girl Julian?""... Of course he'll get the girl mate... We all know the story, and we're already bored by it thanks to the tens and tens of movies using the same narrative ingredients. The story structure in Rango is not only common but is also deceivable, clichéd and pointless since it adds no gram of originality.Despite the beautiful look of the film and impressive execution nothing makes me care about our hero. Where's the emotion?... Where's the emotional core? Rango has emotional moments but not because we care about our main character but because we somehow pledge to the loneliness and hopeless described at some point in the movie. Was that really necessary for Rango?... I will say that it wasn't. The funny moments in the film are barely even there, few laughs in the theater but mostly there were just smiles and voices around me debating something but not the actual movie. Most of these funny moments don't even come from our main protagonist but from our secondary characters. We also have that classic group of characters that create a bridge from one point of the story to the other. The four singing owls represent the narrator's voice but they are useless since they are neither funny nor entertaining. They just come, sing and leave without making a strong point. You will forget about them as soon as their scenes end.As if the gasps in the storytelling's design were not enough, Rango confronts with... politics. An animated film satirizing the world's current issues like our main economical problems and our hunger for resources. Rango depicts the selfishness and creates a pretty dark and actually marxist character in the town's mayor. I was thinking that, okay, it's a understandable thing for adults but is it good for a kid to watch this and being told that if the people don't obey the rules they must be eliminated?... I don't know, maybe I'm a little bit off-topic but I think such delicate issues like that should not be addressed directly to kids.Going to the voice casting, there were good choices but I can summarize Johnny Depp's vocal impersonation as being close to an animated Jack Sparrow: same tonality, same laugh, same mumbling... It looks like he really has a hard time getting over that character. I felt the entire movie I witnessed an animated green and skinny Jack Sparrow. But enough is enough.Let's take a moment and applaud the incredible technical execution of this movie. The picture looked so clean and perfectly drawn, the colors were alive and powerful, the contrasts and the sound mixing and editing was really really impressive. The fight scenes looked like the epic grand-scale battle scenes from movies like Avatar or Star Wars... The cinematography was gorgeous and I must say I was impressed with some of the techniques used in the film. There is a shot of Rango dreaming and that crossover from reality to dreams and back to reality was simply amazing. It's a jaw-dropping visual world. Even the score was good. Good choice of music and not a single waste of wrong tones or anything like that. Everything fitted the movie wonderfully. Rango really blew out the water other animations and is a real step forward into animated drawings and design. It's like a concept car or a new burger. It's fresh.",Rango
150,ChristianUnchained,Fun and clever Oscar material,9,23 April 2013,"Entertaining, Original, and Worthy Of An Oscar (which it won!) Few animated movies can produce such remarks. The tongue in cheek humor shines while smart references to Clint Eastwood and Apocalypse Now permeate the experience, and every scene had a grimy but extremely realistic attention to detail that made this film stand out compared to other animated movies. It is not good as Toy Story (what will?) but at least one director and one studio isn't afraid to make (giant) leaps in the animation genre to produce a timeless and entertaining film. Sure some kids won't understand the true ""spirit of the west"" or the countless references to high noon or The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, but for someone looking for an animated that has more than just stellar animation (Kung Fu Panda, How To Train Your Dragon; all good movies mind you), Rango nails it. This is what I would love to see from every movie. Pushing the boundaries so when we go to the theaters we are overflowed with cliché elements but wold with a fresh and incredibly original spin.",Rango
151,dineshaishu,Rango,8,19 May 2019,"So a slight blurb about how surprised I was that Nickelodeon was tackling several mature themes: Rango boasted quite a number of darker undertones that you wouldn't normally expect from a PG, animated Nickelodeon movie. Such areas included language (sporting such lines as ""You son of a-""!, ""Go to hell!"", and ""Can I gut-shoot someone?""), violence (an impressive amount of shooting and dying), sexual themes (making references to how ""active"" one's mother was and a joke about a mammogram), and the film's portrayal of death (where characters constantly expect Rango's death and at one point, parody death by hanging). That is, you could arguably find just as much material in other animated films, such as The Incredibles- but it just goes to show that Nickelodeon is ready to experiment with a braver sort of film, much like Disney did with Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay, disclaimer over.",Rango
152,CrazyCockatoo2003,A excellent take on western movies.,10,12 June 2020,"Rango is a movie that is considered to be great take on western movies. It's very faithful to the genre since it includes everything you would expect from the western genre as a whole and more and the settings, personalities of the characters and the atmosphere best represent the genre.What I can gather from this movie is the stunning animation, the excellent music, that the characters are very interesting, especially Rango, the visuals are wonderful even for a 2011 movie, the words the characters use are very sophisticated, it has plenty of jokes for older audiences, the owls are great narrators as they properly explain everything that is going on during the movie, mostly in the form of singing, there is a great story to tell, it has one of the best uses of a twist villain in any movie outside of the mystery genre, Rattlesnake Jake is very honest even for one of the main villains of this movie, both the main villains are very intimidating and not bland unlike villains from most other movies, some of the jokes can be funny and the credits animation is just as impressive as the animation from the actual movie.The very few bad qualities of this movie is that the characters look a bit unsettling at times, the usual toilet humor, the usual clichés and it can be predictable sometimes.Overall, this is one of, if not, the best original Nickelodeon movie I have ever seen. If I were to change anything about this film, I would leave it the way it is because its flaws is part of what makes this movie unique, thus I consider it to be flawless even with the said flaws. It is a very heartwarming, feel good movie that I would strongly recommend to you all if you are looking for an excellent animated movie to watch or have kids that want to watch a movie with you. I wish Nickelodeon kept making good movies instead of the mostly mediocre to awful movies they make today.",Rango
153,TroyeEvans,"Hilarious, Distinctive, Western Story About a Lizard's Solitude",4,4 February 2012,"""Rango"" is a distinctive western animated feature that tells the story of a lonely lizard about his journey to finding meaning in his life. I like how the story is filled with hilarious moments and jokes, and I can guarantee you will not be disappointed in the intense action. Our title character has no name; Rango is a name that he makes up. The entire film allows us to witness the adventure of Rango from a nobody to a hero and how he learns about the true purpose of his life and dream.Rango is a unique and highly personified work that prevails at combining the elements of animation, comedy and western taste. It should be the kind of movie that caters for a wide array of audience. This is easily one of the best pieces of animation of the year.",Rango

155,CaptRon-2,"GNDN (Goes Nowhere, Does Nothing)",4,10 March 2011,"This was a movie I wanted to like (I really did) but it just never came together and fell into the pit of average. The character development never gets past Rango so the rest of the cast is nothing more than minor support roles. Villain's are numerous but no one really stands out and it leaves you feeling like a repeat of Spiderman III, one hero, three villains, drifting story.One of the key ingredient to a successful animation is relatable characters. With Rango, the characters are so ugly that you find yourself not caring if the desert or something else swallows them up. Relating to them is next to impossible as they are too foreign to be relative.The story is about finding yourself, being a hero, finding faith, not giving up, knowing your friends, and being a fast-talker. There might have been more but with so many moments it was impossible know what this story really wanted to be. It is far better to create a simple story and add depth than to throw all your ideas on the table and try to paste them into parallel story lines that make sense.It might make a good rental for the kids although very young ones might be frightened by the snake scenes but its not worth movie ticket priced. Credit to ILM for trying but their story writing has a long way too go.",Rango

I hate snakes more than Indiana Jones. I mean - I hate them more than Indy hates them; not I hate them more than I hate Indy. I love Indiana Jones.OK... So to recap - Lizards, snakes... hate. But I still enjoyed Rango. It's a quaint animated tale of an ordinary chameleon who gets lost on the desert highway, on a search for his own identity. He wanders into the desert town of 'Dirt', a town that is drying up fast and whose people are loosing hope. Here, he adopts the persona of Rango, a dangerous wild west style outlaw. Through a series of quirky coincidences and sheer luck, he manages to become the town's sheriff, and becomes the beacon of hope for the people of Dirt.If you've been a fan of the old wild west movies, I'm sure you will enjoy Rango. It's well made, has a serious tone, but has a generous overlay of humor. if you are really turned off by scaly lizard images, maybe you should stay away. Otherwise, I certainly recommend it.",Rango
157,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Rango,8,15 March 2011,"Rango [2011] PG - 107mins - Animation/Adventure/Comedy - 4th March 2011With western films seemingly on the comeback in recent years, it was only a matter of time before an animated version of the wild wild west made it to our screens and it has done so in the guise of Rango.Rango (Johnny Depp) is a somewhat unique chameleon who finds himself, as with many animated films these days, catapulted from within his safe surroundings accompanied by his ever trusty sidekick Mr. Timms (a plastic goldfish) into the barren and unforgiving wild where his adventure truly begins. Depp as usual brings his own unique style to the character of Rango which doesn't disappoint.Rango meets up with many other quirky animals which really gives the movie character and I have to say that the visuals in this are stunning, some of the best out there and it really is starting to get to that point that you forget it is an animation with the scenery and hot dry climate being portrayed looking top notch. Add the gritty looking critters who really look like they have been worn down by the desert and it's a hats off to the animators who have outdone their Pixar rivals (it's a Nickelodeon production for those wondering) on this front.The movies humour is great and combines lots of slapstick, good one liners and excellent facial expressions that really got me going but this I felt is traded off, only slightly, as the movie goes on so that the plot can continue to develop. As usual with these films there is some subtle and some not so subtle references for the older generations that are likely to swoop over a few younger heads. In fact more so than usual I would say with the humour more based for adults than children.Throughout the movie four singing mariachi owls accompany Rango narrating his tale a la the three mice from Babe, well not quite but you get the gist, maybe more the rooster from Robin Hood and provide another perspective that does well to break the movie up and add to the comedy of it all. Speaking of the owls, the music also draws you in and any movie that can play Ride of the Valkyries on a banjo and still make it sound good wins my vote!All in all Rango has managed to combine great jokes, funny characters and stunning visuals within a solid story. The combination of Depp and Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean 1,2,3) has worked once again and it seems to have broken the mould in so far as it's a children's animation and yet I can see the adults coming away with the bigger smiles.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Rango
158,ravsten428,"Good movie that's different, some flaws.",8,5 May 2011,"I saw this movie about a month and a half ago and it was definitely interesting.I had heard reviews that were mostly positive about the film and was worth watching.Rango starts out rather amusingly. We have a chameleon who thinks he's an actor and lives in his tiny glass cage. While rehearsing with his half bodied actress and his wind up fish (Forgot the names of his cast) he's thrust out of the back of a car window while his owners avoid a car wreck.Rango is now in no-man's land and must escape from a Hawk who wants him FOR A MEAL! Tons of action awaits the viewer.Rango is a great film and it touches on things that most people who don't think for themselves it would go right over their heads. This film touches on things such as progression, theology, and even suicide. And also if you watch this movie close enough you'll figure out that the armadillo is representing God.The only drawbacks to this film is it has a lot of swearing such as Hell and Damn and not appropriate for very young children. Also Rango went on a little to long but was still worthwhile.I am looking forward the DVD release.8/10",Rango
159,SamuraiNixon,Shakiest Lizard in the West,8,25 March 2011,"I do not always understand Roger Ebert's penchant for his overuse of the **** rating, but I still take it in consideration when deciding what to watch. I was in the mood to see something in the theater and this week did not seem to have an overriding amount of films that screamed watch me. So I thought instead of watching the poorly reviewed Battle: Los Angeles, I thought I would see what Ebert stated as ""... some kind of a miracle: An animated comedy for smart moviegoers, wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical, and (gasp!) filmed in glorious 2-D."" His rating is, of course, too high, but the movie is a fun and pleasant experience.There is nothing tremendously new or original in the plot. While the anthropomorphism of the various animals thrown together help make it seem they are in their own unique world, film fans are going to notice this is not the case though they probably will enjoy the huge amount of references to other material. Johnny Depp plays Rango/Lars a lizard that had a comfortable existence as a kept lizard in an aquarium with a headless doll and a fake fish for a companion. A near accident in a traveling car causes his habitat to fly out and crash amongst the highway leaving him to bake, shed skin and half to dodge traffic. There he meets an armadillo half ran over on the road (that has to be a little much for young kids) who is a Don Quixote character (another reference to a Johnny Depp project) who sends Lars on his way to meet his destiny.Destiny is a woman lizard named Beans who has a quirky trait which is really just an instinctual behavior gone wrong (she freezes at inappropriate moments). She leads him to a western town that is drying up from lack of water. In fact water is the most important currency there and unbeknownst to the two folks the bank's reserves are almost out. Lars finds himself in a saloon and with his acting talents and his need to not get killed he creates a fake bravado and a monstrously tall tale of heroics. At this point I am reminded of Don Knotts in The Shakiest Gun in the West (IMDb wrongly states that the character was Barney Fife influenced), but of course it also reminds me of the original The Paleface (had to have at least one Bob Hope reference).Through happenstance and just plain luck the townsfolk thinks he is a majestic hero after he dispatches a ravenous bird and gets made sheriff by the town's mayor (Ned Beatty doing an obvious John Huston imitation from Chinatown). However, someone is stealing the town's water and with the bird gone an outlaw rattler has no fear to come back to the town. Will Lars (known in the town as Rango) succeed? Is there any question to what will happen in the film? Probably not, but it is still fun.This is not really a film for kids though. I was paying somewhat attention to the children's and parents reactions and it seemed the parents made the stronger laughs and comments. I wonder if anyone else caught the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas reference. Some of the scenes are a bit strong for PG and in some of the reviews I have read (Modesto Bee for example) they like the film but pan it because it is not for kids.The animation is quite good and it helps to be seen in the theater. While the storyline is a bit trite and perhaps a bit too much material is derivative (even the score is quite reminiscent of Ennio Morricone), there are enough superlative scenes and humor to make this a worthwhile cinematic venture. Heck I might go so far as to say this will probably be nominated for an animated Oscar, as long as the Academy can remember a film before September.Other random information: I have to mention former Modesto native Timothy Olyphant as the voice of The Spirit of the West (I wonder who he is imitating).",Rango
160,taheriitaheriiarian,a masterpiece,10,25 May 2021,"Rango is a definition of a masterpiece it manages to be fun and entertaining in every minute it, the visuals and animations are pretty good that in 2021 i never saw anything like it aside from that the story is phenomenal and its something you cant forget.",Rango
161,joeravioli,Rango finds art in its thematic complexity.,10,29 June 2015,"Rango's animation is outright disgusting. Lizards, singing owls, ugly plastic fish, roadkill, rattlesnakes with machine-guns for rattles, rats, weird blobby creatures, and a homeless man compose most of the characters in this film, mashed together in a weird, reptilian Western about a chameleon in an identity crisis.The film begins with the titular character, a blue-skinned, crooked- necked chameleon, contemplating his dramatic life with his ""friends"" (the torso of a mannequin, a plastic tree, a dead cockroach, and a wind-up fish). However, a bump in the road sends his aquarium flying out of the back of the car he is in, thrusting him suddenly and unexpectedly into a harsh, unforgiving desert.The film continues from there, meandering around peril, comedic coincidence, and strange hints at an underlying message. It is witty, funny, and action packed, while the slightly crude humour adds a much needed dose of edginess to the genre of ""children's films"". And then, just when I thought the film was about to segue dolefully into a cliché-ridden redemption fueled finale, it blew my mind with one line:""Who am I?""A moving pause.""I'm nobody.""It was at this moment that I realized that this film is conveying a message, more powerful, more intellectually stimulating than most children's films would ever dare, presenting itself as the spiritual self-discovery of a chameleon. It is truly beautiful, despite the strange presentation, and vile animation.Good children's films these days often focus on the main character's interaction with others. While they often address the personal impacts of certain relationships, they rarely delve into the nature of the individual in and of itself. However, Rango is all about the individual learning to find his place in the world, learning to cope with his own existence. He discovers that his surroundings define who he is and that his choices are based on the duties that he has towards others. He, as the Spirit of the West says, ""cannot walk out on his own story"". Children, as well as adults, need this theme. So much of today's culture is fraught with indecision over one's identity. This film teaches us that we, as individuals, are defined by our circumstance. While our choices do play a significant role, we have a moral duty to be the people we were meant to be, in order to acknowledge our existence as...well, reptiles.Beautiful movie, one of the best animated films cinema has to offer.",Rango
162,randreww,A waste of water,2,26 October 2014,"The reason why this movie doesn't work is very simple. And it relates to the main character. He sucks. He is annoying, he lies, he is a misfit, has a warped sense of reality, he is ugly, everything he says frustrates you, & his entire character has NO meaning.If you can relate to the main character, everything suddenly becomes relevant to you. But there is nothing more unrelatable than the age-old ""Fate protects fools"" scenario. John Depp has never impressed me. He is one of these celebrities that has had a privileged life due to his looks, & not due to his acting ability. His over-acting in Pirates of the Caribbean, creepy acting in Charlie & the Chocolate Factory & his bemusing portrayal of this character only further convinces me of this.I hate films like this. You hate the main character SO much, but you want to see him do something right because you feel sorry for the other characters that are so desperate they believe in him. That's not enjoying a film. That is a film making you feel awkward. That's what this film does.. it makes you feel awkward. Johnny Depp's middle name perhaps?! It isn't helped by the fact that the creators were so obviously hungry to make this an adult feature, but the studio interfered & wanted it to remain a kids film - which it is NOT. Greed obviously stepped in & ruined the project, but I doubt it would have made much difference. The characters are so backwashed & aberrant that you loose your will to live early on in the film. Talking philosophically with road kill, a slap stick chase with an eagle, & then cryptic dialog with a female lizard who is stoical as she is stupid, for no reason that becomes obvious.Some of the jokes I expected to laugh at considering their bizarre & elementary nature! However, I didn't laugh once throughout this film, because I couldn't stop cringing at Mr Bean.I'm also one of few people who did not like the visuals. I don't want CGI to presume to replace reality. I don't want animations to look like the usual sterile cut scenes you get in films today. I want animations to look animated. I saw Tangled recently, & it blew me away. It didn't look real in any sense, but it made me forget I was watching an animated film at times. THIS on the other hand never let me forget how proud they were of the textures they shoved down my throat with close ups at every possible moment.Some of the music cues were pretty good, if wasted on this feature. It's a shame that we don't get this level of commitment from artists abound, not just film score composers.Overall, this film fails to entertain on so many levels that I think it's actually damaged the Western scene somewhat. It tries SO hard & yet fails so early on. Even Jim Carrey would have been a better choice! Oh dear God! Stay well clear!",Rango

It was pretty disappointing.The first thing I have to talk about is the animation. Now, I liked the backgrounds and all but the characters (except for Rango and the owls) are just not pleasant to look at. Now I get why they did it. They wanted to make it look gritty like quite a few live-action Westerns. But why would they make them *that* grotesque? (I wish I could italicize here). They don't need to look pretty. They can look unkempt without being grotesque. I'm sorry but that was a big problem for me. The story was kind of simplistic and clichéd too. It's been done quite a few times already. There's a guy who's new to a town. He defeats a villain and is called a hero. Then a more dangerous villain challenges him and he reveals to everyone that he isn't really much of a hero. Then...I won't spoil it but you know how it ends.I think they were trying to parody Westerns rather than making a serious Western. I know it was mainly a comedy. But they could still been more original.None of the jokes were that funny either. I have absolutely no problem with the fact that RANGO seemed to be made for older audiences. A lot of people complained that it wasn't for kids and all that. I didn't care. I really liked Ralph Bakshi's FRITZ THE CAT which was meant for older audiences than RANGO. I was hoping for a kind of adult animated movie, which would have been nice for a change. But all we get are references to prostate inspections and mammograms. There was no cleverness or anything.There are quite a few references to films in the Western genre. There's even a Clint Eastwood parody. Once again, there wasn't much cleverness in these references. I hope Industrial Light & Magic tries again, though. I do want to see some quality animated movies outside of Disney, DreamWorks, and Pixar.",Rango

There is nothing new about this movie but ""Rango"" is visually stunning, full of decency and totally hilarious.Though there are problems about the story but it's dark, crazy, and exciting.The story is nothing but reference of other western movies. It's kind of a remembrance but it's not compelling and new. There is nothing new about the story. It's just a western relic.The best thing about this movie is its animation. The visuals are wonderful and eye candy. The character design looks old fashion zany and I love it. Kind of reminded me of ""The Misadventures of Flapjack"" a TV show from CN. While this movie is from Nickelodeon there are some humor that kids will perhaps laugh. The movie is not in 3D. ""Rango"" proves us that 3D is not necessary to our lives. 3D shrinks the scale of a movie.There are no flaws with the voice acting. Johnny Depp is really meant for Rango. Isla Fisher did this before in Horton Hears A Who so it's okay. Bill Nighy is an amazing villain. I want more Ned Beattys' sexy voice. Too bad Timothy Olyphant didn't have enough scenes but it's still great.My favorite thing about the visuals is the environment. Look at the sky and the desert. Cinematography is also great. Every visuals are eye candy. The scene when Rango and his friends are being chased by bats and gophers is truly breathtaking.Maybe the reason why Ebert gave this movie a perfect rating because it's not in 3D.

First of all its not a movie for kids but it doesn't mean it fails for us as well. The script is not new and basically styled in western form. The most appealing thing is the visuals and animation which are just flawless with extreme quality. Secondly the characterization which is not found too strong in much of the animated flicks. Johny Depp has given life to the character of Rango seriously. He's terrific and it feels as if the character was made for the voice of Depp only. All the other characters are greatly characterized as well esp Rattlesnake and Mayor. The elements of humor are placed perfectly. The movie is a little dark and contains some violent scenes not meant for kids but hell I enjoyed them. Very good direction plus excellent cinematography. Obviously it's not perfect as I feel the script could have been better but visually 10 on 10 except the ugly looking characters.

169,cguldal,I'm surprised...,9,19 March 2011,"I am surprised that Rango seems to be doing well in the box office, as I did not think it would appeal to the mainstream American audiences... It certainly follows the classical old western plot, nothing new there, as others have noted, but a certain satisfaction of watching something you know you have seen and perhaps like, if done well.But on top of this plot, there are layers of Fear and Loathing and Star Wars and mariachis that are sometimes not even translated from Spanish, and a pinch of Mary Poppins... So really, the psychedelic quirkiness of the execution of plot made me think that it would not appeal to the mainstream. Voices are done very well, and the art is top-notch. The opening scene has to be one of my favorite scenes in the film, as the lonely pet lizard acts himself into the ""cool guy in town"" with a broken doll, a wind-up gold fish, a beach umbrella, and a dead (real) bug in the little puddle of water in his tank... From this scene, you know Depp will shine. The quick-witted improvisational acting reminded me of Robin Williams's stand-ups. The psychedelic desert scenes were masterful, both in terms of animation and in terms of evoking the good, old western film tradition (I almost expected the whistling to start, the 800 bullets/The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly theme.)I still would not recommend this to my friends who have very mainstream taste and expect an animation film to just be cute and happy. I think most scenes are safe for children, except maybe those involving the large snake, who might be scary.",Rango
170,kikoydaba3,a worthwhile satirical take on the western genre,9,11 September 2019,"Gorgeous photo-realistic animation, brilliant voice cast, quality humor and solid drama, Rango is a rewarding adaption from the western genre that respects its root while taking risks few animated films go.Rango is an ordinary pet who stumbles onto Dirt, a western town slowly dying from lack of water. With a knack for acting, he pretends to be a tough-talking drifter, utterly convincing that the townsfolk instantly believe his front. Through sheer luck, he manages to defeat a longtime enemy of the town, a hawk. After an unexpected victory, Rango become Dirt's sheriff, in charge of protecting the safety and well-being of his constituents. Turn of events during his authority uncover a sinister plot that lies at the heart of the town's hardships.Aside from incredible technical qualities such as the score by multiple Academy winner Hans Zimmer and animation looking like real life (the lighting in particular deserves rave praise), Rango succeeds because it treats its characters well by giving them relatable motivations instead of resorting to mindless slapstick comedy. Johnny Depp, playing the titular character, is a nobody who pretends to be a hero and becomes a true hero. The fact that he pretends to be someone he is not presents an angle of guilt to the character, but this does not get explored deeply during his stay at Dirt. The weakness of the film is really in this aspect. Most of Rango's character development occurs in the beginning and finale. However, the supporting characters are great.Beans, a resident of Dirt, drives the plot because of her refusal to sell her land to Mayor Tortoise John and discovery of a potential conspiracy to intentionally worsen the resident's living condition. The script did not make her a hapless female character, but a very strong one with convictions and principles. Tortoise John represents greed at its fullest, by cutting Dirt's water supply and killing anyone when necessary, even those who aid him in maintaining power, all in the name of unequal progress. Rattlesnake Jake is a paid outlaw who terrifies Dirt's residents under Tortoise John, but like Beans has principles, however wild they may be, when Tortoise John intended to kill him after nearly accomplishing his master plan. He is the catalyst for Rango to eventually find his true self by becoming the sheriff he was placed. Despite clocking less than 2-hours, Rango is also an epic drama involving characters outside of Dirt that makes the film a worthwhile satirical take on the western genre.Rango is obscenely good, perfectly made for both adults and children.8.5/10",Rango

172,Andy_MJD,One of my favorite movies of all time,10,4 February 2020,"A wholly amazing masterpiece, combining animation and western styles.In the modern word of animation where everything is all cutesy and fluffy, Rango embraces its gritty and asymetrical characters, places, and atmosphere. This makes for an etremely engaging cast and scenes.The music is really fun, and is even humouristically diagetic when it needs to.The themes of Identity and redemption resonate greatly throughout this movie (and mak a lot of sense coming from a pathological liar of a chameleon).Admittedly, the glorious animation and large worldbuilding is probably because J. Depp was busy shooting PoTC4 (first one not directed by Gore Verbinsky), so y'know, probably one of the last super indepth worlds we get, since movies like Minions has like 18M budget, and then makes over a billion goddamned dollars. Hate that movie, and I hate 8 year olds.",Rango
173,Teebs2,Rango (2011),7,18 August 2011,"A bit of an oddball animation from Gore Verbinski which rivals, and occasionally exceeds, Pixar's crowning achievements in animation technology with some tremendous textural details and cinematographic effects, aided I'm sure by Roger Deakins's input.Johnny Depp provides the voice of a theatrical but lonely pet chameleon who takes on the character of top gunslinger Rango after he gets lost in the desert and meets a town of grizzled Wild West creatures. Verbinski has fun rolling out all the good old Western clichés and film references, particularly a corruption plot straight out of Chinatown.My only criticism of what is otherwise a very entertaining, gleefully wacky and visually outstanding animation is a lack of that undefinable factor ""heart"", something which I feel is that niggling X factor which Pixar consistently hits and its competitors don't.",Rango
174,SeanDTheFilmMaker,Why is this movie doing so well?,1,6 March 2011,"Because there is literally nothing playing right now. After checking all theaters, even second run theaters, it was either this movie or Harry potter which was at a second run theater and we just missed the 5 O'clock showing. I really don't like harry potter but I love the characters and production value, dialog is just really weird. But then, having no alternative, and determine to see ""SOMETHING"" we saw this one, well the first 40 minutes of it before getting our money back.Keep in mind even rich people get bored in Oregon as there isn't too much to do on a Friday night but eat, drink, and see a movie.....that's it.Now don't get me wrong, even ""I am Bruce"" which is a corniest B movie ever was still a lot of fun to watch but the first thought that came to mind about this movie was, ""HUH?"" My girlfriend and I looked around and the rest of the audience were shifting in there seat and not a single laugh at any of the ""funny parts"". Which 40 minutes into you'd think there would be at least one but nothing really good about it. Now granted maybe it would pick up in another hour or two but lets admit it, compare this to Pixar's ""Up"" Which had you Crying and Laughing, then crying, then laughing again all with in a 10 minute span. These guys are no Pixar, and this movie isn't even rentable. I'm not even sure why it is going for an academy award except for its special effects which is a lame way of putting it. Cause it makes it seem like its going there for best picture, best performance, best script or something which they were all bad. The effects were great, but who cares? South park is just a step above as bad as ANIME but its funny, sick and demented but funny anyway. Once again people are not focusing on what really counts in entertainment, ""Is it entertaining?""And like the others it was gross, slightly on the racist side I mean why did everything in the desert have to have a Hispanic accent? Yeah sure its a western but in some of the best westerns you don't have everyone speaking with that accent. I wouldn't be too surprised if the Hispanic community would have had a problem with every grungy nasty animal had to be of Hispanic origin.So we went home and watched a Pixar movie.",Rango

The visual of the environment were perfect for the story which was actually kind of darker then expected but very enjoyable, and the detail to the characters was amazing. The voice actors did awesome and the soundtrack fit every second of the movie. If I could ask for anything from this it would be to have more scenes of Bean and Rango because from the little peak we get to see of their relationship it seemed to have a lot to offer with comedy and for the people like me who enjoy seeing the dynamic, growth and dialogue within the relationship.

176,brandonsullivan91,False hope isn't hope.,6,18 July 2011,"Rango has brilliant art and is filled with creative ideas. The story gradually loses steam and is unfulfilling in the end.I also disagree with the message sent through the story. Rango is a pet lizard that ends up in the wild and lies about his identity. Eventually the villain portrayed by a rattlesnake forces Rango to confess his false identity to the people and Rango walks off in shame. Inspired by the ""Spirit of the West"", played by a generic Clint Eastwood, Rango musters up some courage and saves the town.The interesting twist is that Rango does not defeat the snake but earns his respect as ""one legend to another"" (neither Jesus nor Satan are real, just legends). The snake claims to be from hell and many are familiar with the devil in the form of a serpent from the Biblical creation account, so it is not a stretch to say the snake represents evil or Lucifer. Rango is the sheriff who has the job to defend justice in the town of Dirt, which could be seen as a Christ figure. The problem is that Rango was not any of the things he claimed to be and did not do any of the feats he bragged about to the townspeople. Through some mishaps Rango managed to temporarily save the town. The theme of the movie appears to be putting your hope in someone, even if they aren't what they claim to be is better than having no hope at all. It could be seen as a shot at Jesus, saying his teachings are better to hope in than nothing, but he was not who he claimed to be.If you think this is a stretch there is a scene where Rango signs the Bible as if he is the author and the movie is littered with Biblical terms (salvation, hell, etc)",Rango

""If who ""Pirates"" and does not like, it's likely, for any not be able to say that the film was unprofessional. I was not prepared for what cartoon I do not like, but I was not sure of the return. Actually, I happy! Quite by accident and suddenly he is standing alone on the road. And it is not a fad. It just happened. Actor, he wore a red shirt and was pretty confident. But in the desert, where he was, there was no hope. Yes, and how to tackle it, if there is not even water! Handsome Rango was able to prove the first minutes of all the residents that he is a hero. And even became sheriff. With this and the adventures begin, full of laughter and imagination.Struck by the fact that there was a sense of presence - as if the journalists were reporting from the scene. For this I must say thank you to artists - an incredible atmosphere, hot and tart, was transferred perfectly. Each movement has been perfected and very clear, that was been noted many details, also played into the hands. Huge cactus - like Arizona, an orange umbrella, falling into a glass, a drop of water - and only seems to last; clockwork fish, palm curve and Gita beside her.Rango itself reminded me of Jack Sparrow - its charming gait and bizarre run - legs in different directions "", well, his awkward dance so all he brought me into raptures. Cartoon turned bright and memorable, and most importantly - funny! Stunning western! Theme music was also very good as the very statement - very original. The ending was struck - not the very essence, and those in which shell that are wrapped. There is no need to analyze the game actors, so we can only say that ""Rango"" - Cartoon about the meaning of life and water, the bright representative of the adventure genre, where there are tears and laughter, weird lizards and wild birds, the voice of Johnny Depp's voice is mixed with Isla Fisher.

181,rkhen,The negative reviews tell you why it's good.,9,23 April 2013,"Rango is a great kids' movie that plays on many levels, like all great kids' movies. About a hundred churchies here don't like it; that tells you it's realistic and morally complex. (One person complained about its metaphors for good and evil, because ""many people take God and Satan seriously"". Yeah, but we don't all think we hold a copyright on them.) And some folks helicoptered in to complain that it's violent and would scare some kids. Fifty years ago my parents took me to see Bambi and it scared me. So did Dumbo. It's vital that kids learn about fear, danger, and violence, and a cartoon is the softest place to do it. Thank God my folks understood that. For the record, Rango's violence is funny and completely unrealistic. Would it kill you to talk to your own kids about the difference between slapstick and the real world?There are ""swear words"" here, if you still think ""hell"" and ""damn"" are swear words, because it's a gritty Western. (That happens to star a chameleon.) There are a lot of Hispanic references and characters, because Hispanics invented cowboys and the ""American"" West; Nickelodeon simply decided to unwhite-ify the Hollywood version, for a change. (The guy I read who complained about that wasn't even Hispanic. Meanwhile, I have Hispanic friends who love this movie, in part because they're in it, for once) There are several stereotypes, ethnic and otherwise, because it's a satire. If you can't grasp irony, avoid this movie. In fact, never go outside. And several minor characters smoke. I hate smoking. But: stereotypes, remember? Westerns? Cultural memes? How about just teaching kids the difference between allegory and real life? As for the moral content, the ""lessons"" of Rango, which, I think I can state without incurring a spoiler slap, are: 1. the world is a crazy place, 2. scary problems have to be solved by ordinary people, and 3. a quick wit and a lot of luck sometimes beats a quick draw and a lot of money. If you agree with that, and aren't scared of your own shadow, see the movie. I loved it, and I'm hard to please. It's a great romp, a witty farce, and a lot of fun, precisely because Nickelodeon didn't sugar it down to pious drek.",Rango
182,jgregg42,"""Rango"" Thirsts for Originality",6,4 March 2011,"In a year that will be bringing us more than 20 remakes, reboots or sequels, it seems that Hollywood is having troubles in the originality department. What's left other than taking an unoriginal idea and adding on some really cool, yet sometimes unneeded, 3-D imagery? It's like putting a rear spoiler on a 1979 Camaro. It doesn't really need to be done but it looks so cool.The creative team at Nickelodeon Movies understood that we don't always need the latest technology crammed down our throats. Sometimes taking a somewhat imaginative idea and developing the 2-D imagery works just as well.""Rango"" begins with a scene of a thespian lizard (voiced by Johnny Depp) with an over active imagination putting on a stage play by himself in his glass case of existence. He is doing a fine job of entertaining himself although he knows that there is more to life. He is the lizard with no name; this leads him to question his own existence. Pretty deep for a kids' movie, huh? Our soon-to-be hero becomes stranded in the middle of the Mojave Desert (which includes a quick homage to one of Depp's earlier cult films). Only being in his new location for a few moments, he has caught the attention of a very hungry hawk. After an extensive, action-packed chase our hero ends up in the hands of a lovely lizard named Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher). She agrees to bring him to the town of Dirt.Once there, our soon-to-be hero finds that by using his self-taught acting skills, he can make up any story and become someone else. The townsfolk of Dirt don't know any better but to believe his wild tales.Things are going well for our hero, who through a clever lie came up with the moniker of Rango. The townsfolk are convinced that Rango had killed seven other men with one bullet. Soon that pesky, hungry hawk comes back and by pure luck Rango kills the hawk cleverly yet unwittingly with one bullet. Because of this innocent heroic act the mayor (voiced by Ned Beatty) soon makes Rango the sheriff of Dirt.There are some problems that come with being the sheriff of Dirt. As a matter of fact, the town is in its worst drought in years and the last of the water supply is stolen. Rango, still believing his own lies that he is actually courageous, leads a posse to find who stole the water.Eventually the townsfolk are shown the true Rango when Rattlesnake Jake (voiced by Bill Nighy) shows up to reclaim his right to be the town villain. Rango chickens out and goes back to being a coward. After a brief discussion (albeit, a discussion under delusions from the dehydration) with another famous ""man with no name"" Rango mans up, or lizards up, and goes back to try to save the town and to reclaim the water supply.Should you see this movie? Maybe, if it was in 3D it would be so much better. I'm kidding. Because this is animated feature you might have the notion to bring small children. This is not the case. There are some adult elements here that would be lost on the younger audience. This would be more of film for the ages 8-13 if anything.The cast was wonderful at voicing their characters. However, the thick old west accents were difficult to understand at times. With the imagery, lighting and shadowing of the computer images, it was pleasant picture to watch. Being set in a desert, I really felt thirsty during the film. Just be sure to drink plenty of water before you go.",Rango

The animators did a wonderful job at giving every character a unique look and feel.The characters within the movie are great, Rango is obviously the stand out, I find a few animated children's movies funny but not as much as Rango, thanks to a wonderful performance from Johnny Depp.But the most amazing, inventive thing this movie did was stand out from the crowd, not follow it.Also, the Ride of the Valkyries scene going through the canon is honestly one of the greatest moments I have ever seen in an animated film.",Rango

It is a tour de force for both animated movies and a welcome addition to the potent mythology of The West.I felt the plot was a bit convoluted, but it plays out well in most cases, with some very epic moments, and some very surprising introspection at times (meditations on failure, hardship, and identity).And it lives and breathes the essence of the classic western, full of dry, hot, dusty openness and grit.

188,Dory_Darko,"Funny, weird, fun (in a weird kind of way...)",8,24 July 2011,"'Rango' is typically one of those movies that can't quite be categorized into this or that little genre of comedy. Obviously, it's an animated film. Is it a kiddie movie? Well kind of. Allow me to elaborate. The film starts off absolutely hilariously, with an accident, half a road kill and a journey through the desert turned into a maniacal chase as soon as a hungry hawk gets wind of Rango's presence. After meeting a lovely lizard named Beans, he ends up in the small town of Dirt. Where, after a good deal of bluff and dumb luck, he is appointed sheriff. So far, no harm, no foul, just good comedy. In fact, nearly-wetting-my-pants-laughing-out-loud-comedy.However, at this point is where it all turns just a little bit haywire. No real damage done, just a small sense of cluelessness as we go along. The story continues as though Gore Verbinski and John Logan were just trying to think of as many weird situations as they possibly could whilst forcibly trying to mash it up into one, cohesive storyline. Truth be told, seems like they were trying just a little bit too hard. It actually gets even a little bit boring here and there, where the pacing kind of sinks in up to the point where it all comes together and starts to make sense again. (Mind you – this could also be due to the fact that I was watching the extended version, not the theatrical one, but still.) But fear not, no real quality is lost, as 'Rango' provides some of the most excellent and funny characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. They also rounded up a perfect voice-cast, with Johnny Depp who doesn't sound anything like Jack Sparrow, but still adds the same kind of awkward quirkiness to his character. Alfred Molina's part is small but vital, and I'll bet you've never heard an armadillo with a perfect Mexican twang before Bill Nighy is awesome as Rattlesnake Jake, and you can even hear a little bit of Davy Jones coming through sometimes. One of the best parts however, is done by Ray Winstone as Bad Bill. Who would expect some Wild West bad guy to have a cockney accent? Brilliant.Another thing I must mention is the superb animation. Without a doubt the best I've ever seen from a non-Pixar production. Heck, even if it was Pixar it would have been their absolute best so far, and that's saying something. The animation parallels – or, dare I say, even surpasses – Finding Nemo. That's right; I said it, so sue me. Yep, Industrial Lights & Magic made a fan out of me.Now, back to the original question – is it a kiddie movie? Yes and no. Some parts are totally hilarious and will have your youngsters rolling over the floor with laughter. Other parts will sail right over their little heads as they are very much grown-up humour with references to classic films and jokes they simply won't get. (Is it just me or did I catch a tiny reference to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in the beginning?) Another factor is that some of the humour is a little grim and quite mature for small children, with some of the creatures smoking, swearing and even getting shot and/or killed. Now, personally I don't know any children who would be upset by any of this, they see things that are much worse on a daily basis on the Disney channel. But then again, I'm not American, and it is my understanding that some American parents are hugely bothered by some of the elements in this movie. So I would recommend that you simply watch it first and then decide if you would like your children to see it. But honestly, I would try not to be too sensitive about it, it doesn't get scary anywhere and none of language or behaviour is really that bad. All in all, 'Rango' is definitely a fun ride, and one of the few animated movies that will entertain as many adults as it will children.",Rango
189,Cel_Stacker,Rango -- There's No Western Like It,8,4 March 2011,"I realize a review is supposed to talk about the movie, but indulge me for a moment.I enjoy Westerns. But, that wasn't always the case. My mother of all people turned me on to the virtues and value found in ""Bonanza"", ""Cimarron Strip"", ""The Big Valley"", and ""The Virginian"". Later, I would discover what made everyone from Sergio Leone to Clint Eastwood cool. I came to respect the romance and intrigue inherent in the genre; rarely was I turned off.It's that much more pleasing when the genre is taken in a different direction. We have an excellent example this year! It starts with a neurotic pet chameleon (Johnny Depp), naturally well-versed in drama and portrayal. Cruel fate sees him stranded in the wasteland, literally guided by voices, as he spends an amusing opening trying to survive. A chance meeting with strong-willed rancher lizard Beans (Isla Fisher) gets him a ride from the sewer to the toilet, a last-legs town, appropriately called ""Dirt"". There are water problems as well as outlaws aplenty. Mr. Neurotic lays eyes on a label in a saloon, spins a few tall tales, and Rango is born! After more dumb luck sees him nail a hawk and run toughie Bad Bill (Ray Winstone) and his gang off, Rango becomes a name in the community.But, can he figure out what's behind the water shortage? He's on a clock, since to said outlaws, a sheriff's star may as well be a bulls-eye.Prior to rushing out to see this, I heard a couple of pre-cog complaints about ugly character designs. That's easily answered, along with many other stigma you true believers may be having. First, if you are into clean, perfect, ""attractive"" character design and execution as displayed through the rose-colored, 3-D VR helmets borne of the PIXAR/DreamWorks debate, stay away from this film. That goes triple for you parents looking for the next animated film before which to plop your kids down, where any animated film will do. Don't do it. Save money and gas...go see ""Toy Story 3"" for the twelfth time.None of that here. Just as men are men and women are women in the Old West, ""Rango"" is it's own film. More ""Shane"" than ""Shrek"". More ""Foreign Correspondent"" than ""Finding Nemo"". It's gritty. Raw. Filthy. Surreal. Disturbingly violent at times. But with just the right amount of well-placed humor to break it up. Gore Verbinski's trademark pacing, put to increasingly awkward use in the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" franchise, works surprisingly well here. Equal attention must be paid to animation director Hal Hickel and the ever-improving staff at ILM, as they trade firm handshakes with art director John Bell and production designer Mark McCreery in the successful effort to craft stunning, unforgettable visuals, accented by outstanding lighting, which puts the fruit of the current 3-D, hi-def craze to shame. The not-so-original, yet solid story receives further grand support from a sweeping score by the winning Hans Zimmer and the further contributions of co-producers such as Mark Bakshi. (Yes, he's related to that Bakshi. Those in the know need not hear anything further. The rest of you, get to Googling.) Everything about the film cries ""unorthodox"", including the performance of a highly capable cast, who actually performed their scenes on sound stage, near-to-unheard of in animation procedure. Keep eyes peeled for humorous set pieces and important cameos. This is well worth your repeat viewings.So, head on west. But leave the kids at home to wrestle with PIXAR, DreamWorks, and the other juveniles of the terrarium.",Rango

This movie has both intellectual humor, and potty humor. But like actual funny Potty humor. Like I don't usually find that stuff funny, but by some miracle they put a burp joke in this movie, that actually made me laugh. I don't think I've laughed at a burp joke in a good five years. There's one scene in this movie at the water Bank,(one that involves opossum) that I really admire, because I know several other animation companies I would have dragged the joke out far too long and made it unfunny. This movie knew when to stop. Also how did the rattlesnake Jake not scare me when I was younger? I can see that dude as terrifying, and there's one of very intense scene with him where he says a couple words you don't want your baby hearing. Overall this is a movie with a funny, entertaining, semi spiritual, story, and visuals better than what we have today. Well I mean I made this review in 2019 so that statement may be dated later.

Well I can agree with one thing it definitely is a bit off or odd. Which I liked. I kind of expected as such from the previews and with Johnny Depp and Gore Verbinski at the helm.One film I would compare this to is Antz from around 10 years ago. Antz to me was one of the best early animated films in terms of writing and story. Great animation too. Technically I believe it was the first digitally created animated film. This one has a similar tone in its quirky off kilter approach to its characters and story. I find it also similar in that Rango has a very original take on its setting and characters.One thing you noticed, or should rather, is the immense detail in animation. I would easily says this gives anything out there a run for its money when it comes to textures, shadows, etc. Many of the animal characters look quite close to real if it weren't for their clothes and facial expressions etc. Regardless wonderful animation. Any shouldn't it be, it is after all the first film from Industrial Light and Magic which is ran by Lucas Films. I sincerely hope they put another one of these gems out.If you enjoy original and quirky characters and story this is the film for you. I wouldn't say it is necessarily for kids given some of the adult humor at times and just a general off beat and darker style that I wouldn't think would really appeal to a younger audience.

195,lourensini,"Rango, For the Love of Water.",8,11 March 2012,"What would I expect from a movie called Rango with a lizard on it's cover if a haven't even read the synopsis before watching it? Yeah, it took me by surprise.Latelly we have a new Depp's movie like almost every month, and since he does the same job all of them, he's getting to repetitive for my taste. But Rango couldn't be done by another actor. This time, Depp has overcome my expectations, and he was brilliant. Another actors did an amazing and remarkable job, but the attention I've gave to Depp was because I wasn't expecting to much from him.Rango is fulfilled with an amazing soundtrack that is capable of stealing viewers attention every time it shows off. Characters design was also pretty well made and they also kinda remind me some actors I've seen before, like Kate Micucci (Raising Hope) and Beans.References to Fear And Loathin in LA was a plus, too bad I couldn't see another one like another viewers, but Rango has it's bonus.Visual art and character design deserve some attention too, and the atmosphere is also stunning.Plot ain't the best I've seen from an animation movie, there's lotta things that could be improved or changed (like every good movie has, since we humans has the ""power of creativity"") and because of my constant pursuit of originality as an spectator, I did expected little bit of changes in the plot since I started to understand whats going on. Because of this predictability, I can't give Rango a an 9.But what about the message? Rango has a brilliant and expressive one: ""Who controls the water, controls everything.This is an Inconvenient truth, what's Rango is all about. Almost like a science fiction predicting future. We'll be re-watching Rango in 50 years from now in children's in primary schools to teach kids to better take care of the world and all that attitudes we'll be embittering off someday.Another problem in Rango was some moments characters could remain quiet but they wasted on old jokes. This is something we don't do nowadays if we wanna make an original film.Except two little things that could be done, Rango is amazingly well directed/produced/designed and performed movie. Worth 8/10",Rango
196,santiagocii,This is a masterpiece. Period,10,21 October 2018,"The creation of a lateral Wild West story out of a pure accidental event is just 100% imagination.

197,beccad90,Alternate Title: Existentialism by Salvador Dali,9,19 April 2011,"If you took Sam Peckinpah, Terry Gilliam, and Disney and put them all on Hunter S. Thompson's brainwaves, you would get Rango. Yes, this movie is as outrageous as it sounds. It's surreal, it's gritty, it's undoubtedly sneaky with its wit and humor, and its all the more fun because of it.The film stars a chameleon (Johnny Depp), going through an existential crisis, as he has lived his whole life in a terrarium. When that life is quickly—and literally—shattered, he finds himself walking in search of water. Instead, he finds a town called Dirt, where all the residents are plagued by outlaws and a severe lack of water, which is used as currency, it's so rare. Rango, seeking acceptance, assumes the role of sheriff, a role that has been played before, but with more unfortunate results. To make matters worse, someone is dumping water in the desert and draining all of dirt's resources. Who could it be, what is their diabolical plan, and is Rango really the unlikely hero of his own story?In case it wasn't obvious enough from this summary, the film's tone is surreal, complex and almost shockingly mature for an animated picture. It blends in so very many movie references, blending the gritty, revisionist western with the surrealism of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a too-obvious comparison on the latter's part. Director Gore Verbinski had a unique way of producing and directing this picture: he gathered Depp and all the other actors on a sound stage, in various costumes, acting out their scenes, as a sort of visual reference. Depp affectionately—and appropriately—called this 'Emotion capture,' as it gives the movie a more natural, organic feel, as if the reactions were believable. When it's put on screen, it's full realized in both interaction and appearance.What most people have touched on when talking about the pros of this movie is, indeed, the stellar animationand, boy, is it stellar. Granted, some of the human cameos are kind of on the flat side, but our animal heroes are textured and expressive, which is important in this kind of movie. We can reach out and touch these sets if we were able; the roughness of the scales, the harsh desert heat and the sponge and spikes of cacti that crop up throughout are just a few of the details in this grand visual experience. The characters that make up this floundering town are actually interesting to look at and listen to, as the animation and awesome voice work give them all distinct and likable personalities.Resident include old prospector mouse Spoons, large, but quiet tomcat Elgin, morose, trigger happy little aye-aye Priscilla (Breslin), and, my favorite, the kind, but no-nonsense Beans (Fischer), a rancher lizard who finds herself falling for the goofy, but sincere hero. But, by far, the biggest fan favorite has to be Bill Nighy's rogue, Rattlesnake Jake, who is hands-down, flat-out scary in any scene he is in! How any kid will survive his scenes is beyond me! However, that made him more of a threat that Rango needs to overcome, which is more satisfying in the long run.Overall, while Rango has a few glaring problems (like seeing the Spirit of the West, who had been built up too much to show his face and be effective), Rango is easily one of the best movies of the year, if not one of the best-animated movies. It's surreal, but rewarding; strange but still gets the message across in a reasonable way that all can understand. Just don't bring the under 7 crowd, as it may be too odd and definitely too scary (*coughRATTLESNAKEJAKEcough*), but for those who can tolerate it, Rango is a trip that you soon won't be forgetting, no matter how many times you watch ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.""

200,katie-sirles,Rango - The Kids Movie that is not for Kids,7,19 April 2011,"Last night while I was watching Rango, I felt myself putting an honest effort into really enjoying the experience. I haven't read any other reviews because I feel that is bad form for a film critic. It makes it difficult to concentrate on one's own thoughts and feelings. I did, however, see that my guy – Roger Ebert – gave Rango four stars and a standing ovation. This is troubling, as I feel that four stars is a generous rating for this one.Let me first say that just because the movie has the Nickelodeon name attached to it does not mean it is meant for children. Like the great Wall-E, this movie is one that appears to be marketed for children and adults alike, but is really for the older crowd. Whenever I make this judgement, I imagine my niece sitting next to me in the movie theater. Would she enjoy the film? Not Rango.Although the four-letter words don't get more extreme than H-E-double hockey sticks and one ""damn"" thrown in, the peppering of ""hell"" throughout the film appeared to be abundant. This is fine for my big girl ears, but I would have felt uncomfortable had my niece been there.I suspect some will say that the film is not marketed for the younger demographic. I beg to differ. Not only is it a cartoon, but it is a Nickelodeon film. These two things coupled with the fact that all of the previews show cutesy scenes with little cartoon creatures say to me that this movie will be kid friendly.I don't want to harp on this much longer, but there are a few scenes in which the movie is even scary. I think that PG rating could definitely be bumped up to a PG-13. Not to mention all of the political aspects of the film. Kids aren't going to get that stuff! Corrupt leaders and a seedy underbelly lead to many jokes that children will not get.Perhaps I'm just a fuddy-duddy.However, if you are an adult, you might really enjoy this movie. It has its laugh out loud moments. There are classic Depp moments as well. An homage to a former Depp film that was completely unexpected came across very well. Certain Captain Jack Sparrow characteristics were also present. ""That's interesting"" Basically, Rango is the story of a little chameleon voiced by Johnny Depp who hangs out with a headless, naked Barbie torso with a missing arm and a wind-up goldfish. He knows nothing of desert living until he is thrust into it. In a little town called Dirt, Rango must save the town from a drought and find himself.It was nice to see a strong female role in the film, though in the end she still needed rescuing. Isla Fisher is barely recognizable in voice as Beans, the love interest to Rango. Also unrecognizable was the fantastic Bill Nighy whom I love dearly most of the time, but Rattlesnake Jake is one mean dude. Little Abigail Breslin (Signs, Little Miss Sunshine) voices Priscilla.The cast is great, the plot is good, and the movie over all is decent. I could have done without the owl mariachi band, but I suppose they served their purpose.-Ms. Silver Screen founder of mssilverscreen.com",Rango
201,FanPerspective,Rango is a masterfully written western revival,7,6 March 2011,"Getting separated from his owners as they drive through the desert, aspiring thespian chameleon Rango finds himself in Dirt, a small ""Wild West"" town that is suffering from a drought that is suspected to be caused by a conspiracy. Knowing that he is a stranger in these parts, Rango creates himself an entire new life (including the name Rango) that makes him into a heroic outlaw and lands him as the town's new sheriff. With gritty and masterful writing, Rango comes to life as homage to the classic western with themes and humor that play well with the adult crowd, but of course featuring light-hearted slapstick styled material to allow the younger viewers to have some fun. With great animation an entire ensemble of characters comes into existence before our eyes, using a new technique of ""emotion capture"" where the actors actually performed each scene rather than standing in a studio just recording their voices. Johnny Depp is so far gone into his charismatic yet insecure character of Rango, giving him a real heart and soul to carry as the film's protagonist. Other characters are portrayed by Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Abigail Breslin and a menacingly vicious performance by Bill Nighy. For his first animated feature, I think Gore Verbinski has done a wonderful job at bringing an alteration of a classic tale, one that is a rarity in films today. From its great writing to its strong performances, this is a film anyone will enjoy with a geniusly incorporated reference to a previous Depp film, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and capturing the true ""spirit of the west"".",Rango
202,tombtim,Now? WE RIDE!,7,30 March 2021,"The film looks ABSOLUTELY STUNNING and I can tell a lot of work was built into it.

203,MovieCriticDave,"Stunning, dark Depp animated offering is no child's play...",5,4 March 2011,"Let's make this simple. ""Rango"" is one odd movie.When it comes to ""Rango,"" a theater full of bouncy young kids proves that marketing works - months of commercials pushing a wide-eyed chameleon voiced by Johnny Depp and supplanted by all manner of cheery dance tunes drove kids - and their parents - in droves to the premiere of the highly-hyped animated tale of reptiles, desert animals, and the wild west.After seeing ""Rango,"" however, and finding it to be anything but a kids animated movie, one can't help but wonder if most of those kids won't leave disappointed, their parents feeling mislead, and musing if even one of them will come back for a return visit. ""Rango"" is an odd-duck movie that's tough to endure once, but offers almost no compelling reason for a return visit. ""Rango,"" to be sure, is a visually stunning, nearly photoreal production of a group of slightly scary ragtag desert creatures in a nearly dead town visited by a bright green chameleon stranger sporting an Hawaiian shirt. What follows is just under two hours of an oddly crafted morality play that is one-third classic Western, one-third ""Raising Arizona,"" and one-third Johnny Depp certified oddness. If ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" cross-bred with ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Rango"" would almost certainly be among the offspring.Oddly, in none of those thirds can you say that ""Rango"" is particularly funny. Sure, there are the requisite cute moments, but the photorealism of the creatures, and the intensity with which some of them are depicted, make drawing out a sustained chuckle a bit of an arduous task. ""Rango's"" dark theme isn't helped by moments where one wishes for the pace to accelerate - there's only so much computer-textured chameleon introspection you can tolerate in one movie before you start wondering, ""okay, what's next?"" ""Rango"" isn't a bad movie, but it isn't especially good, either. Dragging at times, bizarre at others, when it finally ends you catch yourself leaving the theater with one uniform conclusion:That was one odd movie. Then again, with Johnny Depp in the lead, could one expect anything else?",Rango

Rango should definitely win best animated feature for the 2011 Oscars, and at least be nominated, if not win best picture. The characters are likable and funny, it has a great plot (as well as many great sub- plots) Johnny Depp was fantastic, as usual, and so were Ray Winstone and Alfred Molina.

Approach it like it is fully fledged western that has everything and more of that genre.If you get past that than you will have the pleasure to see one of the most funny and entertaining movies made this year.However, the story has nothing new to offer. The fake hero plot is old, we've seen it in animated movies too, like Chicken Run. The liar with a potential good heart returns to save the cityThe rotten leader who sells out his people is not a bright and blossomy idea either, only in this here movie, we have the tortoise, usually an animal of wisdom, representing the corrupted character, in a rather uninspired association made out of negligence or just to avoid a more clicheistic animal. While that may seem rather unoriginal you have never seen the ""new place, new identity"" gimmick done like this.This animation is a great way to introduce children to the classic western theme.The landscape is beautiful, the enemies are great and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to the film (there is a fantastic version of ride of the Valkyries).

Rango manages to side-step a lot of the western cliches, relegating those strictly to visual and audio motifs. In staying with an original story, Rango should also be commended for their refreshing tale without the need for plot twists, a crutch that storytelling giant Disney has fallen on so frequently in recent years. Despite their narrative handholding and generous foreshadowing, we're still rewarded with an exhilarating climax with a strong albeit brief standoff between the main forces of the story.Also, the owl band is super charming.

209,jkcanewton,A real surprise,9,6 March 2011,"I want to put this as simple as I can...Rango was great. I'm surprised that this movie came out so early in the Blockbuster season, it easily could be put into that category with a little more promotion. The animation was top notch and the voice-overs were spot on. They could not have had a better cast to voice the colorful characters in this adventure. While watching the movie I couldn't help but think of Blazing Saddles, of course for kids. The one thing I found upsetting was some profanity in the film, that really spoils some of the scenes. I wish films would't promote this language to kids, we have enough of it in society as it is, but now to start including it in films geared toward children is a little over the top. I am glad of one thing...it WASN'T in 3D. I was getting a little cross-eyed with all the 3D lately. I actually prefer to see films that are not 3D. I can't find the $3 overcharge justifiable.

212,thale05,"A Quick-Witted, Clever Piece of Animated Cinema (Just Mind the Kids)",8,6 March 2011,"Nature seldom shows mercy to its inhabitants. Every organism must adapt quickly to survive in the wilderness or die. Life is typically short for most members of the animal kingdom and when evolution momentarily halts, every resource is sought for to survive. ""Rango"" understands the facts and gleefully expresses them to us on screen. It's difficult to calculate how long it took for the creatures of ""Rango"" to wear Western clothes and handle guns but who am I to judge a creative animation flick in such a scientific way. Yes, ""Rango"" is the new name of the West and it resonates swiftly across the land. After concluding the ""Pirates of Caribbean"" trilogy, director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp reconnect to abandon the sea and embark on a vibrant adventure across the sands of the desert. Johnny Depp voices Rango, a pet chameleon who aspires to be a thespian. He knows he can be anybody he wants to be but he feels confined by his limits. After a freak accident, Rango becomes lost in the middle of the Mojave Desert. He finds a small town called Dirt but realizes ""strangers don't last long around here"". Instinct tells Rango that he must quickly blend in before he is ostracized or worse. He manages to improvise and assumes the identity of a gun-slinging legend that has brought down some of the most notorious outlaws with a single bullet. The townspeople (or townscritters) find hope in Rango's actions and false reputation so they urge their Mayor (a tortoise voiced by Ned Beatty) to appoint him as Sheriff. Rango now runs a town in the middle of drought where the low supply of water is controlled by the Mayor who has devious prospects in mind. If you recognize the references, you can tell that ""Rango"" is a parody of some of the finest films ever made. As a nod to ""Apocalypse Now!"", a Western banjo ensemble performs the infamous ""Ride of the Valkyries"" tune in an aerial attack scene. That's what I look for in parodies these days: clever and creative takes on past movies, not mere mentions. The water conflict in ""Rango"" is practically identical to the plot in ""Chinatown"" and Verbinski is considerate enough to model the Mayor's clothing, mannerism, and quotes after John Huston's character, Noah Cross. However, ""Rango"" mainly lampoons the Western genre with a keen respect for the movies and legends (keep a look out for one particular legend). Instead of men on horses, we see small creatures ride roadrunners into the setting sun to thrill us with nostalgia. Because there are people wanting to see an exciting cowboy flick, Verbinski delivers all the goods needed to satisfy the hungry fans from wagon chases to quick-draw dueling.As usual, Johnny Depp prevails as a character who desires acceptance above all else. I am assuming because of persuasion by Gore Verbinski, Rango has a Jack Sparrow moment or two. Since Rango is a self-described actor, Depp masters numerous dialects to transition from one identity to the next. The act tells us that Rango is a ""lonely lizard"" who is unsure about himself and his future. It's no wonder why Depp has become the one of the world's most talented living actors. Rango's love interest is a desert iguana named Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher) who, of all the citizens in Dirt, is the most skeptical of the water crisis. The trouble with Beans is her continual wide-eyed expression throughout the movie accompanied by her malfunctioned defense mechanism. Nevertheless, she is the only sign of staunchness in a suffering town. All the voice-actors perform effectively and seem to embrace their roles. The stand-out, besides Depp, is Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake, a legendary diamondback with fiery eyes and a pistol-cannon as his rattle. I knew how well Nighy can act before ""Rango"" but I had no idea that he could brandish a menacing, Western accent in place of his Scottish tongue.The CGI, provided by Industrial Light & Magic, in ""Rango"" carries a precise elaboration to capture the glorifying environment and content of the film. There are some scenes with a hallucinogenic beauty on a grand scale which further intensify the spectacle of the whole picture. Composer Hans Zimmer doubles the delight with his striking, Mexican- Western style score to sensationalize the art while a mariachi band of owls melodiously narrates the events as they unfold. The screenplay is written by Academy-Award nominee John Logan who has lent his hand to projects including ""Gladiator"" and ""The Aviator"". Logan's script is loaded with bullets of witty irony and bright pop-culture references while he critiques the weaknesses of financial institutions and the political uses of religion. ""Rango"" provides a less-than-satisfactory amount of physical humor for the kids. To be blunt, not a lot of children are going to understand the humor but the adults and some well- informed teenagers will. The Johnny Depp fans are going to have a blast more explosive than a handful of dynamite.My Rating: 8/10",Rango
213,ultimatedisneycruisefan,One of my favorite Nickelodeon movies!,10,18 November 2021,"This movie is definitely suitable for teens and grown ups, and it IS family friendly though, but does have dark scenes. I gotta say this is one of my favorites tied with Spongebob and PAW Patrol: The Movie. Johnny Depp is definitely a great voice for Rango!

214,neji107,Nickelodeon bares its fangs,8,2 March 2011,"So a slight blurb about how surprised I was that Nickelodeon was tackling several mature themes: Rango boasted quite a number of darker undertones that you wouldn't normally expect from a PG, animated Nickelodeon movie. Such areas included language (sporting such lines as ""You son of a-""!, ""Go to hell!"", and ""Can I gut-shoot someone?""), violence (an impressive amount of shooting and dying), sexual themes (making references to how ""active"" one's mother was and a joke about a mammogram), and the film's portrayal of death (where characters constantly expect Rango's death and at one point, parody death by hanging). That is, you could arguably find just as much material in other animated films, such as The Incredibles- but it just goes to show that Nickelodeon is ready to experiment with a braver sort of film, much like Disney did with Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay, disclaimer over. Rango is beautiful film that, regardless of its content, gave everyone in the theater a darn good time. Borrowing heavily from classic Westerns (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) and Western comedies (The Three Amigos), the film brings reinvents a past formula in an amusingly creative way. Rango, a pet chameleon unsure about how he wants his identity to develop, is suddenly cast to into the life of the wild wild west and decides to assume the duties of the sheriff in a troubled town. When the gunslingin' enemies arrive, the trouble begins...If anything, the film is revolutionary in its animation. The quality and textures of the animals and landscape is simply spot-on and never ceases to amaze. By far this is the movie's greatest strength- and supporting the beautiful visuals is a whole slew of jokes. Like I said before, sometimes the humor is a bit awkward for its targeted audience (there were definitely a lot of times adults laughed instead of the kids) but for the most part the theater as a whole enjoyed the comedic spots. The voice acting cast is of course lively and fun, bringing a unique quality to each and every animal character. And lastly, the score by Hans Zimmer is once again majestic and exciting (influences from his work in Pirates and Sherlock Holmes are easily heard, but with a Mexican twist!).Overall, Rango is a beautiful and exciting western adventure that you shouldn't miss! As long as you know what you're in for, the humor and the visuals will take you for an unforgettably pleasing ride. 8/10",Rango
215,Forn55,Meta-Western...,5,13 October 2011,"""Rango"" is a fascinating oddity: a meta-Western, heavily larded with irony, sarcasm, cliché, and adult sensibilities, couched in an animated film format that uses the time-honored (some might venture to say ""time-worn"") plot structure of a movie for children. There's little doubt that the movie possesses technical brilliance; the animation is dazzling and dazzlingly executed, as one would expect from this first, animated feature out of Industrial Light and Magic. Director Gore Verbinski keeps the film zipping along at breakneck speed and the longueurs are infrequent. BUT... for all its not inconsiderable entertainment value, ""Rango"" doesn't quite succeed as a movie. The problem lies primarily in its unsettling disjunction between message and medium. ""Rango"" sounds like a children's movie, looks like a children's movie, but isn't a children's movie. It attempts to encapsulate the naiveté and wonder that are the distinctive hallmarks of childhood, but constantly undercuts those qualities by its heavy use of ironic, self-reflecting commentary. Adults viewing it will enjoy toting up the movie's clever samplings of ""oater"" cliché from time immemorial. Their enjoyment of it will be magnified by their knowledge of ""High Noon"" and other western flicks. Children, who -- for the most part -- lack that cinematic context, won't get it. And, since the movie derives much of its generative power from that context, children seeing ""Rango"" will have to fall back on the action chase sequences and the toilet humor for enjoyment. I suppose, given the impoverished level of much of what passes for ""children's entertainment"" these days, that may be enough for some kids. But I suspect the makers of ""Rango"" were after something better and I wish their ""grasp"" had lived up to their ""reach."" It's a shame, but I'd guess that many adult movie-goers (who would enjoy the flick, if they saw it) will bypass ""Rango,"" thinking it a children's movie; many children will see the movie and come away from it confused about what it means, however (briefly) entertained they may have been by its gaudy mayhem. ""Rango,"" in brief, would be a better movie if its movie-makers had been less concerned with showing off how clever and cutting-edge they were and more concerned with how best to tell their story in ways that were both appropriate to and apprehensible by their intended audience. With an ""A"" for effort and technical achievement, ""Rango,"" alas, only merits an overall, ungentlemanly ""C.""",Rango
216,a-ozornin,Best Animation of 2011,9,17 January 2012,"It actually caught me by surprise. I expected light cartoon for children, but I saw the best and humorous animation of 2011.Rango has a very simple, straightforward storyline, mainly for children, the usual ""our hero does not know his place in life but then hardship and love help him to figure that out"" pattern. But that is not the storyline that grabs the attention, but everything else. Gore Verbinski uses the storyline as the skewer to stick together all the finer parts of the movie: great animation, characters, humor and Johnny Depp.Characters in Rango are almost alive. You start to like every single one of them, they are charismatic, funny and much more lovable than, say, the toys from the Toy story. Rango, pondering about his life, Beans, giving a fight to get the water back to the town, old Mayor, Rattlesnake Jake – the positive characters are charming in their clumsiness, negative characters are charismatic in their evilness. It is even hard to single out the character that would be a ""supporting actor"" only; they all play their important part in creating the festive mood. Even the plastic fish! But it is easy to figure out the character who is outperforming the rest: Johnny Depp as Rango is mind-blowing in his coolness. He actually makes the lizard live on the screen, giving him his habits and facial expressions. It is those little intonations that always make the difference, and Depp nailed them perfectly.The third component of the success is the humor. Starting with the quartet of the ""story-tellers"" who keep predicting the death of the main character and finishing with some cliché jokes about cowboys in the Wild West. It is a top-notch parody, which has a go at the Star Wars, Pearl Harbor, and, in the moment of self-irony by Depp and Verbinski, the Pirates of the Caribbean, to name only few. The jokes are nice, sometimes involve black humor but are always funny.The final component is the animation. The characters move so smoothly and naturally, they are so detailed, you can actually see every strand of wool, every piece of dust. This definitely compares favorably with the Tintin plastic-headed clumsy characters which move like they are from the computer game from 90s. In Rango, every bit of the world is drawn with laser-sharp precision, so that at times it feels like a full-scale feature film.VERDICT: Humorous and charming, probably the best animation in 2011.WATCH: with or without kids, but with clear intention to relax and laugh a bit.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com",Rango
217,abecipriano,"Two stars out of ten, and that's generous",2,25 March 2011,"Pluses: Visually well done background, some good voice acting. It can put you to sleep. (Oh wait, that last one is not good for the movie, but good for you if you've had a long day like I did and watch this movie at 10pm)Minuses: a lot; dragging story, advertised as fun but it's really not. I don't want to waste more time typing up a review. Bottom line: Don't see it. Even on DVD, folks.But if you expect that it's got adult themes delivered in animation, then maybe you'll feel satisfied after watching this. And then maybe I'll rate it a 4 out of 10.",Rango
218,zhombu,Magnificent,10,19 December 2011,"It is with immense sadness that I eject ""Rango"" from my Blu-Ray player to send it back from whence it came. And in hindsight, I regret not making it to the theater when this was released. I spent nearly a year ignorant of the magic of this film, a time when something untoward might have happened to me and I could have left this world without having a chance to have seen it.Get the picture? Often, one can get a better idea of what is great about a film by reading the negative reviews, most of which, for Rango, consist of terrified parents who didn't pay attention to what movie ratings mean. ""PG"" means that, ""some scenes are not suitable for children"". What that actually means is, SOME SCENES ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN!!!!!! The movie is gritty where it needs to be gritty, coarse where it needs to be coarse, and terrifying when it intends to be terrifying...and all the more brilliant for it.Pixar does make fabulous animated films. I was overjoyed by ""Monsters, Inc"", touched by, ""Nemo"", and thrilled with, ""The Incredibles"" but Nickoldeon has financed what is surely the finest animated film of all time. All work in it is spectacular, from the tiniest details to the phenomenal voice-acting. Bill Nighy's briefly seen but essential character rates, to me, as one of the most frightening villains ever put to the screen, such was his performance. The detailing in all of the characters regarding movement, idiosyncrasies, and texture are astounding. In extreme close-up one character, speaking in great fear, has his eyes blinking appropriately to convey his feelings. But one eye, one time skips a tiny, tiny bit and executes a partial double-blink. It's barely perceptible but it conveys the effort this character is having relating his tale. It's something an actor might understand but surely not an animator? But no computer made the decision to animate it that way. That is an example of the depth to which Rango has been produced.The backgrounds, the texture and feel, the music, the classical Greek convention with a inspired Southwestern twist (you'll see) gives sharper viewers a decent idea of how deep this story will go beyond the obvious.Rarely, RARELY have I watched any film I liked a second time IMMEDIATELY after finishing it the first time but I began the second, stop-and-go-back viewing the next morning, seeing a thousand things I had missed while watching wide-eyed in the moment on the first go-round. I can imagine that the same Puritan-type parents who whisked their kids straight from the theater and hurried post-haste to post a ""don't waste..."" on IMDb about this movie are the children of those equally horrified parents who did the same (minus IMDb) when they ran screaming from ""Fritz the Cat"" in 1972 wondering what the ""X"" rating was for having probably assumed it meant ""Xtra nice for kids"".For you parents who don't know your ABC's well enough to have bothered to understand what ""PG"" means, for you, there's a big, purple, stupid dinosaur waiting to hug you. For the rest of us who bothered to pay attention, there are amazing films like Rango. Watch it once, watch it again, and marvel at the true mastery of the state-of-the-art",Rango
219,babyZ2020,WHO AM I?,7,20 May 2020,"This is a movie suitable for teenagers and adults who are struggling to live in reality.We are all chameleons who love flower shirts, will shed their skin and change color, and are keen to play the heroes.We are greedy for the beautiful mask, and all the glory and enjoyment it brings. We kept changing colors, disguising and dreaming. Facing a thousand kinds of personnel, we have a thousand faces, a thousand forms, and a thousand dreams. We use countless lies and daydreams to weave a grotesque world-an all-encompassing fragile space.However, after wearing the mask for a long time, it is not the true face after all. There are too many lies, and you can't tell the truth from the truth. A beautifully crafted false world, no matter how beautiful it is, is ultimately false and unbreakable.Lango 's ivory tower was smashed by a traffic accident, he began to shed skin, began to change color frequently, began to pretend to be his envious hero, and began to fabricate a big lie actively or passively; our tumultuous years gradually passed away, as if stripped The shrimps with shells are scarred. We are crazy to search for new shells. We gradually become what we once hated.Lango is looking for water, what are we pursuing? Lango found himself on the other side, and we once asked ourselves, who was I?""Regardless of the level of knowledge, a person can deeply organize his heart, which is very charming in itself.""I think knowing who you are, where you come from, and where you want to go is the first step on the right track of life. We are not born with the vision to see through the essence of things, nor are we naturally born with the ability to tolerate our own flaws and shadows, but at least we should have the courage to dare to see through. Ability can be cultivated, courage, but it is difficult to find it again.Should I be a tired and flamboyant Lango, should I do it too, watching the success or failure, the indignant owl?The story about Lango's opening all the way after recognizing himself is more like another laugh from the director. Is he smart? No. Has his ability greatly improved? nor. Like the first half, his success is basically blessed by luck. Chicken broth has some perspective: Recognizing yourself does not bring a particularly intuitive benefit to life. Work hard on the ground so that this ideological storm will not become a joke.Let's talk about the other characters in the film. The mayor controls everything in the town, and absolute power leads to absolute corruption. If water can make me profit, then I will take it for my own use; if the people issue doubts, then I will make some stupid people's policies; what should I do if I have a thorn and don't listen I continue to incite public opinion and let the stupid people isolate you. The trick is pierced? It's okay, I'm violently repressing, letting you a few farts live or die.It is not difficult to find that many town residents fell into the trap just at the stage of the policy of stupid people. They have no big ambitions, but only water that can survive. Alive is their only pursuit. The mayor gave them a little sweetness, and they were grateful to Dade and convinced. Rango showed his skill by luck, and they vigorously pursued it.But, life, how uncertain and illusory. Maybe tomorrow will die of thirst? Even if there is water, can you keep your braid up if there is any accident? When the subject of life is left alive, they will lose their basic judgment and thinking, so they support the mayor, so they closely follow the footsteps of Lango, and indirectly become the accomplices of the lack of law, the loss of morality and the family , How sad.And who is isolated and regarded as a freak? It is a little mistress who often froze. For her, living is second, and continuing the vitality of her father 's farm is her lifelong pursuit. Although this pursuit seems ridiculous and extremely outdated in the context of the background, compared with the former, the level is much higher.It is precisely because the heroine not only pursues alive, she has more faith or goals than others, so she first notices the clues of the bank, and can also see the disguise of Lango and dare to question the mayor. She's so dumbfounded that even though she is constantly derailed from reality, she can see life better than those who are sober all day long.In the chaotic world, there are heroes, bullies, revolutionaries, drifters, and naturally there are water-stealing thieves in the fly camp. But are you too good to condemn them? It's really difficult. In the face of survival, everything has to give in.Let 's not say that those who ca n't live are suffering. In ordinary life, are we too deceived and squeezed too much to challenge too little? Is it also tempted by fame and fortune to do some things to steal chickens and dogs? Faced with difficulties of all sizes, should we be silent or fight bravely?This is really difficult to choose. After all, I can't wait for no protagonist halo, and I can't be a famous hero, just a mortal man, just a cut leek. However, this does not prevent us from restraining ourselves, seeing things and seeing people better, and being more transparent.""Everyone can't escape their own story.""At first glance, this sentence seems to be talking about the fate we talk about all the time.There is an excuse to say that life is the weak, and luck is the humble word of the strong. But I am even more convinced that every person is born with life, with luck, without distinction of strength or weakness, without distinction of height. Calling it destiny is worse than calling it ego, calling it the ultimate pursuit of the soul. That is the truth that can never be violated. Maybe some people don't know what they are pursuing for their whole life, and they are in a hurry. Or perhaps, many people have pursued too many things, go round and round, but eventually return to the original point.As mentioned above, knowing who you are is the first step in life. With this ability, we can see things around us more macroscopically and more thoroughly, and see the world in which we live. I do not seek to make this world perfect, but I want to live to be clear and transparent, and have no shame in the pitch. Even if it is ugly and unbearable, we can embrace it as hard as we embrace imperfect ourselves.I love this chameleon.May we all know who we are, where we come from, and where we want to go, may we all embrace the world vigorously, and may we all find our soul in the west.",Rango
220,CC4ever,Who am I?,8,15 June 2020,"Although he was not very interested in Westerns and had not seen a few, he was still attracted by the self-torture of this green lizard.Who am I?The basic issue of philosophy, Rango from a carefree little lizard, became a hero Sheriff Rango with a lie, and finally classified as nobody. What he has experienced is not only traditional adventures, failures, and discovery opportunities, but also the recognition of his identity in this film. Lango is like a young man who has just stepped into the society. He has the ability to perform. He is complacent for finding a small position for himself, but he does not know that power is the disregard of life. Even more frightening is that when Lango saw all the truth, defeated the mayor, and won endless water for the residents, at the same time, he also knew that there was a power that was hundreds and thousands of times stronger than the mayor and could never resist. There is always there, on the other side of the road, and I don't know when to extend the tentacle to the side of the road. He is just a nobody who can do nothing to help everyone.Everyone is unique, but many unique ones are no longer special. Accepting his ordinary is a major issue in life, but this does not mean to spend a lifetime of life, Lango accepted his ordinary, so he went to the marmot (?) family for help, he accepted his ordinary , So come back to rescue everyone as ordinary as you are and stop the mayor's urban hegemony plan.

It's the creativity of the animation that I think is great. If someone said to you that they were going to watch a animated movie about talking animals, what image are you going to have in your mind. Something with the art style of Illumination or Disney, right? Well this movie completly does away with that and uses a grittier and for the theme this movie was going for. Brilliant cast to fit too, Jonnhy Depp as Rango and Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake are my favourites. Overall great comedy so slightly older children.",Rango

The enormous attention to detail and how they match up animal characteristics to the characters they play is very satisfying.

Which also means that western films are dead to us expect for the grown-ups who lived their whole life watching it.In Nickelodeon Movies' newest flick, Rango; that's become of another story.Rango tells the story of a chameleon stuck in a little town better known as they called it Dirt; he makes himself a sheriff and goes by the name of Rango.Pirates of the Caribbeans co-stars Bill Nighy and Johnny Depp join forces once more with their old director Gore Verbinski (whose also directed other movies like Mouse Hunt, The Weather Man, The Ring and The Mexican.) in this oddly weird picture as we called it an animated movie.Rango may look like an innocent children's film due to the PG rating, but it's more than that. Think of the Legend of the Guardians when your watching the flick, but with swear words thrown right into our very own faces.How is it they get away with it you may ask? Who knows? But Rango is not as bad as you think. Other than the good pep talk it's gotten since it's release in spring-time, this is not something a little child should be seeing. Teens will laugh and surely adults too will probably wind up falling for it.On my watch and in my book, Rango deserves it's 9 out of a 10 for me.

The 3D animation is excellent in a story adapted from the old western movies a modern spin.The water is the money, and also the source of life, in a close allegory for modern days in a very intelligent way.In the midst of it all, an outsider comes to save the day, and every one (maybe except the underground critters .he! he!). In order to do so he will have to discover his inner strength as well as the truth in his motivation.It uses as reference the old Clint Eastwood westerns and Star Wars saga, among several others, and voice stars like Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher and Ned Beaty, and the outcome is very effective on drawing in the kids as well as the grown-ups, in an exercise in animation excellence.Personally I especially liker the four howls as great and funny storytellers.Excellent.",Rango
226,Peppered_Productions,Rango Wrangles You In,9,7 January 2012,"A Johnny Depp film that dons its lead character in the Hawaiian shirt of ANOTHER Depp portrayal ? THEN has this new chap actually intersect with the original character in a fun twist on both their story lines?I'm in!It's a familiar story - a silver-tongued, lonely coward flamboozles people into believing he is their hero. Uncharacteristically, he comes to embody exactly those traits - until he is outted by the evil, greedy PTB. Along the way, he befriends, and comes to rely on, a smattering of oddball characters. Resolve reinforced, he throws himself back into the fray.I'll admit, I am not familiar with all the classics this animated piece pays homage to. But, there were enough clever shots, word play, and a well-paced plot that my attention was fixed throughout the movie. I love the freedoms that animation affords a well-written story. There are actions and belief- suspending scenarios that, in a live-action picture, would seem....well, animated. Facial expressions, flights of fancy and poking fun at pop culture (old and new) were some of the elements that evoked classic Looney Tunes episodes - full of suggestive asides, exaggerated, yet underplayed stereotypes, and the inevitable potty humor.This is one of those movies that makes me want to watch the films it takes its elements from - and then go back and give a second view in order to appreciate how it was all pulled together. I had one or two ""Labyrinth""-like moments where I noticed small details, easily overlooked that add to the enjoyment of this film.It's a predictably happy ending, but the path taken to the payoff is what makes Rango worth riding along.",Rango
227,filmfreak-ochoa23,An Underrated Masterpiece!!!,10,10 August 2011,"Rango- 2011 Wow. Just pure love was poured into the western genre with this film! From the opening credits resembling Ennio Morricone's score from the classic Spaghetti Westerns to the intro with the singing Mariachis doing the Corrido about Rango the western legend, this movie was one of the most fun moments I ever had! The plot even centers on the fact that the western legends are forgotten and replaced with modernization, but the fact is that legends never die. The references to Fear and Loathing with even Depp resembling his fast talking performance of Duke, which in my opinion was his best performance so I'm not complaining and is a breath of fresh air from seeing his Sparrow impersonations in Alice and Tourist, and a couple of endless references to classic westerns that I probably missed. The ones I caught were the Tuco reference with the Toad yelling like Tuco yelled at Blondie at the end of Good Bad and Ugly, the little girl resembling the girl from True Grit, the man with no name being the Spirit of the West was beyond priceless, score resembling Ennio Morricone's score from the Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West, and the snake resembling Lee Van Cleef to name a few, I'm pretty sure there are more!! The movie had hilarious moments that resembled Chuck Jones cartoons without resorting to pop culture references, looking at you Shrek, like the scene where Rango eats the cigarette and then blows fire to the lizard's face, animated in a way that resembled classic slapstick cartoon humor that I missed from animated features. It reminded me of An American Tail for today with the same type of love and effort that was probably put into this film. A must buy for Western fans and animation fans!!",Rango

But Rango... is a complete movie experience with food for everyone! Rango is funny, childish, satiric, ironic, sarcastic, philosophical, emotional, visually stunning... and an entertaining raw movie!! The story is strong, stronger than most live-action movies! The comedy is subtle... and childish where needed. The characters are, in lack of other words, beautiful! Their attitude, their symbolic racial representation, their realistic gritty clothing, intelligently placed weapons... everything is masterfully designed! Every frame is an artwork, with western giddiness inflicted in every pixel, choreographed and painted with wild vivid imagination! Rango can easily be called a masterpiece in animated movies! The story basically follows a typical western spaghetti story - a lawless bent town dealing with desperate times, looking for a desperate hero. A stranger finds himself crowned their unlikely hero after taking down an imminent danger, with a lot of help from his luck! But the real danger is just temporarily stalled... and everyone's hope may just drown along with our hero, whose inept soul searching leads him to lie, deceive to achieve what he never could as his normal self.The typical well-behaved bad guy, who has continued to fool the townspeople for years, must uncover Rango's true self to stop him from disclosing the real secret to everyone... resulting Rango's spirit to shatter and Rango would disappear never to come back.

Right from the start there was not a single scene that pulled me into the movie and till the end I was hoping it will change for the better but it never did. The supposed to be funny moments were more annoying than anything else. Many scenes were so predictable and dumb. It didn't take me much time to figure out where I've heard the snakes voice accent before and its Davy Jones from the pirates of the Caribbean part 2. They are already attempting to make the same thing happen again between Depp and Jones ?The other bad thing about this movie is the choice of characters, not even a single living thing shown in this movie is likable which is mentioned by many other reviewers as well. I'm so disappointed with this movie. Even the magic of Depp didn't save it.

If you are looking for humour like that of Ice Age, Kung Fu Panda, Flushed Away or even Over the Hedge, then this would not appeal. The story line is basic; Majority of it slow and leaves you waiting for a punch line. Johnny Depp is excellent at his expressive tones of the character and I would hope he continues to do animation voice overs. For me, it just didn't appeal. I wanted more humour and more purpose to the story. I even felt a moral lesson could have been learnt, if the producers had thought of one, I for one didn't pick up on it. The movie doesn't leave you wanting to see more and each scene you feel let down you didn't get the full value of the time spent on the animation due to the weak script. There is also some singing in the movie, sort of a narration - totally unnecessary and made me question whether they had a decent story to tell and if so, then just let it be told naturally. If you have some spare time watch this movie only after a heavy lunch or Sunday dinner, not after a night out, as the thought of sleep is tempting.",Rango
231,peakcrew,Overall very good movie,9,6 March 2011,"This is a great film for children and adults alike. Contrary to the bizarre moans of the (presumably American) commentators on here, there is nothing to disturb or distress children at all. Like all great comedy, this works on so many different levels so that adults and children get something from it.The reason I have not given ""Rango"" the full ten stars is the very tedious opening scene, leading up to the accident that really begins the film. It could have been effectively trimmed to half the length, and I would still have known the same amount about the lead character.I've seen other commentators on here going on about some ""continuity errors"" as if this is the only film that has them. I actually think that they are deliberate, and go hand-in-hand with the continuing narrative from the Mariachi Owls that the hero dies. Why? Well, it seemed obvious to me from the point that the road-killed Existential Aardvark (or whatever it was) started talking that the hero was already dying, and the whole film takes place in his head. The whole film was a sequence of references to other films, and given that our hero was clearly a film-buff (e.g. the Buster Keaton/Donald O'Connor dummy scene before the accident) that it is easy to see his last moments of life being played out in terms of the silver screen.Whatever, ignore the nay-sayers unless you don't like animated films (in which case, what are you reading this for?) - go and see it and enjoy it.",Rango

With background score as close as it can be to genre and a cameo by ""The man with no name"" you can't resist liking the movie. Run time is a wee bit longer or so it may seem due to the story. Movie starts with our Hero in the middle of drama scene and ends with a action sequence & takes you to a range of levels in between. Movie has a pinch of crude humor,a dash of profanity, and a lot of violence. Guess that is why its rated PG. Our Hero tries to introduce a bit of romance now and then but is taken by other ""important"" problems at hand.All in all a good movie to watch if you like westerns and wish to see and animated for that matter.",Rango

To me, he brought one of the best performances along with Abigail Breslin. Miss Bean (Ilsa Fisher)-had a very uninteresting character to me. She gave her all to her performance, you can tell, but it still wasn't enough to make her character the best it could be (but I did enjoy the accent.)Priscilla (Abigail Breslin)-had a great performance and it completely matched Johnny Depp's.

236,VardAntinyan,An OK movie with a somewhat stretched plot.,5,24 September 2016,"There was a good cinematography, but the plot was predictable and stretched. Some actions in the middle were unconnected to the story. Originality was good here and there but the overall story was not original. Overall not impressive, except the costumes and the landscape. The start was interesting, which made me interested, so I followed the plot. But at some point, when Rango become Sheriff, things started to be uninteresting. From that point to the point of meeting the snake and leaving the town was very general plot with no real interesting events. Then meeting the Man with No Name was interesting again. The face off with the snake in the end promised to be a good concluding act. But again, it was stretched into something else, and I lost the interest again. The message of the overall movie was not bad, but as I said, twice in the middle I got destructed with mediocre plot. I understand some people will love this, but I also warn that people who are looking for an original plot and an original message will not get much. Good luck with watching!",Rango
237,pzazz_hij,"Rango... Every archetype, convention and finest detail is here! The west lives on...",10,4 March 2011,"Rango... yes it is a play on the classic Western Django. Thats why its so interesting!I had eagerly awaited the arrival of Rango, not only as a western fan but also as an admirer of Gore Verbinski; and the inclusion of Johnny Depp has yet to be a bad thing. The trailers had almost completely left out any kind of plot hint, which i now realise was a very good decision.So, the story is that a chameleon, with acting ambitions, longs for social interaction outside of his lonely environment. His wishes are granted when he stumbles into the western town of 'Dirt' and takes over the vacant role of Sheriff. When he discovers the towns water supply is almost run dry he searches for answers along side the townsfolk, all of whom believe Rango to be their Saviour.If you have seen the trailer you will have noticed the singing mariachi owls, who tunefully break down the forth wall to open the film. Not too dissimilar to the rooster in Disney's classic Robin Hood they help guide the story along and in doing so also keep you guessing. Which was a real bonus for me in terms of animated films as they do tend to get predictable, despite how well they are told. Rango himself upon first meet is absolutely NOT a hero. Even more interesting though is that his name is not Rango. In fact we have no clue as to what his name is... no doubt an obvious reference to the classic Spaghetti Westerns to which its inspired by and its Eastwood lead 'Man with No Name' character. But Rango, despite his lack of name, knows what he wants and Verbinski very clearly makes sure the audience knows too... He wants the chance to be a hero and to one have a story to tell. Let the narrative unfold...The real winner here is the scenery, its animated alright but i was struggling to believe that at various points in the film. The scene in the saloon towards the beginning is fantastically lit and the final showdown is shot better than a lot of the classics. I'm not kidding! In fact I would happily pay to see it again just to look at those shots again because they capture the tension so well.Although the real audience is those who love the classic west, Verbinski is able to make it accessible to a vast number. The younger audiences will definitely appreciate Depp's eccentric character as well as the very well timed humour, both visually and verbally. The more mature audiences will appreciate the latter a lot more so. The story is excellent! It unravels perfectly and its runtime passes by almost without effort. Rango is western... make no mistake. But i assure you one thing should you decide to give it a chance, its what it needs to be! Its entertaining, action-packed, funny and sincere. Above all else, it has what makes a great film, alongside the great protagonist is a great antagonist! Rattlesnake Jake is scary... he's great with his words and deadly with his gun and he helps build to a great and tense final showdown!Rango gets 10/10 from me!",Rango

241,JephyrX,Visually Stunning....but weak plot,7,16 March 2011,"OK...so I'll preface my comments by saying I do a bit of art and ""hobbyist level"" animation and am much older than the nickelodeon crowd this is aimed at.But from an ""artist's"" point of view, Rango's character designs and animation are fantastic. Throughout the film I was continually impressed with various scenes. Some of them are so realistic that you could see them seamlessly integrated into any live action film (and no doubt this is where 3D and live action are already well on their way).Rango's character designs are unique and only in a few cases distract from the story. Case in point: Rango's ""female love interest"", a lizard, has a bug-eyed, thyroid condition look. In addition, when one villain (a much talked about snake) finally makes his appearance...he is over the top and very CG. Otherwise, most of the character designs are very unique and really hit the mark. The voice acting (and casting) is well done throughout.The gunslinger, bar scene is suspenseful and masterfully ""lit"". (Having everything the Star Wars Cantina scene lacked : ) Against that tension, it then provides the biggest laugh of the movie.From then on Rango begins a slow plot-line descent into the curse of modern movie making: Chase scenes, shootin' guns and flyin' bullets, explosions etc. A curse it seems 90% of the new movies I see fall into. Maybe Hollywood knows something I don't (it sells??) But I'm sooo tired of: ""Introduce hero and friends, introduce villains, introduce building conflict, resolve it with HUGE shoot-outs and chases and explosions, and, of course, the hero wins."" SHESH! : ) Over all, although I've mentioned negatives, there is something very new about Rango. I hadn't seen these types of characters before....and did I mention the design and animation are visually stunning? : ) I'm sure many future 3D movies will look to Rango for inspiration.",Rango

It has a lot of references to other movies, with the Hawaiian shirt Rango's wearing straight from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Visually brilliant, almost Pixar-esque. Proves 2D is still relevant. Really amazing shots, with time-lapses, motion blur and more... Great voice-cast & dialogue, with Johnny Depp as the main act. Great use of sound, especially with the classics Ride of the Valkyries & The Blue Danube combined with great western music. The story is nice, although pretty typical for a western. But at least it reaches a new and young audience. Highly recommended, much better than the pile of sequels nowadays, also in animation. Rating: PG / 6",Rango

The scenery is great and the quality of the characters are brilliant and magnificentThe only problem that I had from the film is that I think they were more adult jokes instead of children's jokes as me and my friend were laughing at the adult jokes more than the childish ones.I also believe that this type of film is ideal for older children to watch but I believe that it is not particularly ideal for younger children because of the adult jokes.Apart from that, this is a good film that had me entertained from start to finish and it provides a exciting western adventure for everyone.Rango is going to get a 7/10 from me.",Rango

Many of my friends loved it. The film was directed by Gore Verbinski, and I praise much of his work for Pirates of the Carribian. I've read that he says himself that 'Rango is not a kids film - it just happens to have earned a PG rating'. With this in mind, I was glad to expect something as grand as pirates with a great story, great action, great ideas, and GOOD humor as opposed to senseless jokes to get the kids laughing.Well, when I saw it, it DID INDEED seem like a kid's film. Many things were unrealistic, and just overall pointless. The singing owls were annoying, and BEANS, Isla Fisher's character, put me to sleep and was annoying herself. The film would go on and on, my rating dropping every minute. When I left the theater, I was at a 5/10. A disappointment for Gore Verbinski.HOWEVER: if it were not a Gore Verbinski film, and perhaps a film of a young, average kids film director, I would greatly praise it and give it a 8/10. For a Verbinski film, it's 5/10. For a film in general, I'd say a 6/10.Also, it'd be best to be an adult when you watch this, as there are many parodies of films the kids definitely can't see yet. However, the 'kid' quality of it pulls down the adult enjoyment, leaving the film for a half kid, half man type person.I recommend you see it, as you might like it. Just be aware of what you are looking for.P.SHans Zimmer's score is brilliant! Purchase his 'Rango Suite'!",Rango
245,Crimson_Hawk,Rango,6,19 June 2011,I wasn't sure about this film when I first heard of it but I gave it a chance any way. I'm glad I did. The animation itself is pretty good but not as good as the likes of Pixar and the film in my opinion runs a bit too long but they are the only flaws. The characters in the film are fantastic ranging from the strange side characters to the main they provide plenty of laughs through out and also they provide a level of charm which has you feeling for them. Its too early to tell how this film will stack up against the other animated films which are on the way but I personally think its one you shouldn't miss out on it will keep you entertained throughout what ever age you are!,Rango

248,mleeper,"This is a smart, hip comedy that works for adults and kids.",8,6 March 2011,"RANGO(a film review by Mark R. Leeper)CAPSULE: A pet chameleon falls from a truck in the middle of the Nevada desert. He soon finds his way to the dying Western town of Dirt where his bragging and his lucky defeat of a predatory hawk make him the town's new sheriff. Sadly, the town is drying up for shortage of water. In the best Western tradition Sheriff Rango sets out to save the town. Sight gags, film references, jokes, action, and just plain funny storytelling follow as thick as a hail of bullets. Director Gore Verbinski shows his animation direction of John Logan's script is as good as his live-action direction on films like PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. This is a smart, hip comedy that works for adults and youngsters alike. Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4) or 8/10RANGO is a ""funny animals"" sort of animated film, but the writing and situations are funny enough that it might turn out to be one of the best animated films of the year.In a world like ours (but where intelligent talking animals live side-by-side with humans) the chameleon who comes to be called Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp) would like to be an actor. He dreams of a life in front of a camera. Then his habitat terrarium rolls off the back of a truck and he finds himself stranded in the dry Mojave Desert. He wanders into the animal-run frontier town of Dirt. Swaggering into the saloon he tries to play the part of a Western tough guy. He brags that he killed a gang of seven outlaws with a single bullet. In a fight with predatory hawk Rango lucks out and kills the hawk. The townspeople now believe his bragging and want Rango as their new sheriff--failing to tell Rango that his predecessors named to that job may have lived to regret it ... or not.But Rango probably won't have his job long. Dirt has some real problems. Rango comes to the town just as Dirt is parceling out to its citizenry the last few days of water. When the water source dies the town will soon follow it, and that day is less than a week away. Meanwhile the mayor (Ned Beatty) of the town seems to still have big plans. He tells Rango that who controls the water controls everything.Okay, let me digress here. This is what THE INCREDIBLES called ""monologing."" It is a major weakness in the writing. This statement is the key to everything that is happening in the town. In his anxiousness to make sure the viewer knows what is going on writer John Logan has the mayor saying exactly the wrong thing to the new sheriff. It is not hard for the viewer to figure out who the villain has to be just by his appearance. This is virtually a confession before Rango even knows there is chicanery going on. And part of the chicanery is the stealing of the plot of CHINATOWN. Another part is the counterfeiting of a cameo appearance that had me fooled. Timothy Olyphant does a spot-on impression of another famous actor. I found completely convincing, and I am generally good with voices.There were several familiar actors voicing major roles. Besides Depp, Beatty, and Olyphant, there was Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Steven Root, Harry Dean Stanton, and Ray Winstone. Animation directors seem to feel the public needs familiar voices to appreciate the characters. I frankly doubt that most viewers pick up on all these voices. Admittedly some of these are very good actors. But the film industry is full of good and deserving actors who are out of work. I personally think that it is bad for a successful actor to accept a voice-only role that could go to an actor less successful.It is good that animated films are starting to be considered acceptable for adults with or without children to see. Some of the best writing is going into animated films. I often find myself in theaters seeing animated films where my wife and I are the only party without children present. Good writing should be savored and appreciated and there was really even too much good writing for anyone--adult or child--to take in on one viewing.Smart, crafty, hip, and full of wit, RANGO may be one of the best films of the year, animated or live action. I rate it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale or 8/10.Film Credits: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1192628/What others are saying: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rango-2011/Mark R.

250,jtmytake3,Western High Jinx,9,13 April 2011,"Picture it a western set in the desert with desert creatures playing out this tale of desperation and woe. Enter Lars (Johnny Depp) a chameleon looking for purpose a method actor of sorts, there's irony there somewhere.....Lars after a shock to his world and surviving an encounter with a hungry hawk bumps into Beans (Isla Fisher in excellent vocal form) who takes him to the town of Dirt a lawless town in the middle of nowhere with desperate townspeople struggling to survive against insurmountable odds. They are all desperate for the precious resource that is water....I mean come on there in the middle of the Arizona desert what did they expect? Through sheer luck Lars who has now taken on the name Rango, unwittingly kills the hawk plaguing him earlier in the story and suddenly hero status is thrust upon him along with the sheriffs' badge and he starts to really live up to the role. But the water which is kept in the bank is stolen and when Rango starts to investigate he finds mystery at every corner. Can Rango solve the riddle of the missing water and get the girl....or lizard girl.....and also save the inhabitants of Dirt? When I first saw the trailer to this movie I knew I had to see it and even though the trailer was vague I was intrigued with the animation more than anything else. This is special effects company ILM's first foray into the world of animated feature and when I say they have attracted and ensemble cast they definitely have gathered together some voice talent. Joining Depp and excellent Fisher are Ned Beatty, Ray Winstone, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Harry Dean Stanton and Bill Nighy to name but a few. The film is quite simply excellent and the animation is faultless, the dialogue punchy, witty and clever. The film is full of filmic references which are ingeniously placed, for instance when Rango is being knocked about the highway and momentarily hits the windscreen of a passing red Chevy Cadillac convertible whose driver and passenger bear an uncanny resemblance to Depp and Del Toro's characters from 'Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas'. There is also the spirit of the west, an eerie like character who bears a startling resemblance to Clint Eastwood, tobacco chewing drawl and all and a nod to the excellent Coen Brothers 'Raising Arizona' via the Carter Burwell theme. The story is clever and inventive and the voice acting is sublime with Depp, Fisher and Beatty shining ever so slightly above the rest of the voice talent on offer. I honestly cannot fault this movie it was hugely entertaining and my kids loved it and although it is directed towards the young ones there's plenty here to engage the more cerebral of you......and adults. 'Rango' is on general release so catch it now before it disappears to DVD you'll enjoy it....I assure you.",Rango
251,Mrohnoes,A Great Tribute to the Traditional Western Film,9,12 May 2011,"When I first saw the trailer for Rango, I didn't know what to expect. After seeing the movie, I can say that this is a great movie. It has a great story, great characters, great voice-acting, and also, great animation. One thing I noticed were two references to other movies set in the West. The first is when Rango smacks into a car. The driver looks to be modeled after Raoul Duke, specifically from Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. The other is when Rango hallucinates about the ""Spirit of the West"", who gives him some encouragement. If you're a fan of the Western genre, you'll notice that the spirit is modeled after Clint Eastwood. If that wasn't enough, it turns out the spirit is called ""The Man With No Name"", a reference to ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", which also had Clint Eastwood in it. The only thing I didn't like in this movie was the humor, which was groan-inducing, to say the least. Other than that, this is a great movie. Check it out sometime.",Rango
252,TheDeadMayTasteBad,A spaghetti western... with a lizard as the lead,9,12 March 2011,"Rango is not only in love with the spaghetti western, but with movies in general. There's a scene in the opening that plays tribute to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a ""bat scene"" later that winks at Apocalypse Now, and numerous nods to Sergio Leone's westerns throughout the course of the film. Rango is a passionate movie that's passionate about movies. This in no way suggests that Gore Verbinski's latest doesn't stand on its own two feet. To date, it's by far the most interesting and unique film I've seen in 2011. While it does play tribute to many predecessors, it doesn't let the homage make up for its lack of narrative. John Logan's script is full of character and wonderful, delectable dialog that dances off the tip of the tongue. As with ""True Grit,"" I found myself wanting to quote the film after I saw it, displaying my movie ""geekiness"" for all to see and judge me by. Logan, to my surprise, also injects the film with a level of surreal that makes it more interesting compared to many of the other mainstream animated films being released today. In fact, I dare say the script and narrative is quite daring. Younger children may not only be confused by the path it takes in terms of storytelling, but also miss much of the banter and humor in the film. I haven't said this about a non-Pixar animated feature for what seems like some time now, but Rango is quite intelligent. It doesn't speak down to its audience with the obvious. Sure, there are somewhat predictable plot twists and turns (anyone who has seen a handful of the aforementioned spaghetti westerns of years past will notice similarities to Once Upon a Time in the West, The Man with No Name trilogy, etc.), but the story is presented in a very interesting manner.Despite the fact that the film is computer generated, much of the ""puppetry"" in the film reminds me of the Jim Henson films of the 80s. The creatures are so full of life, so detailed, and so wonderfully molded into their roles. The animation style--thanks to the imaginations of James Ward Byrkit, David Shannon, Eugene Yelchin, and Mark McCreery--has a strong and significant impression on the film. Rango, quite frankly, looks unlike any other animated film I've seen. Additionally, the style helps to compound the surreal nature of many of the films events. John Logan's script and the visual/art style work together in perfect conjunction. As far as direction goes, Gore Verbinski's fantastical style that dominated the look and feel of the Pirates films is here is in prime form. In fact, there's a scene that involves our lead lizard and rolly pollies that reminded me of a certain Davey Jones' Locker sequence in At World's End. The action set pieces show off all of the experience Verbinski has garnered over the course of directing the swashbuckling series. I haven't felt as exhilarated by action/adventure scenes since I last watched an Indiana Jones film. I constantly caught myself grinning like a fool during the more frantic moments of the movie. When it comes to the voice acting, Rango is sublime. Bill Nighy, in particular, does outstanding work as Rattlesnake Jake. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and comfortable with voicing the Mayor of 'Dirt.' Without spoiling anything, the biggest revelation for me was who lent their talents to bring a voice to the Spirit of the West.One thing that ultimately separates Rango from the majority of films I've seen so far this year is that it's memorable. It's been a day since I've seen the film and I'm still chewing the film over in my mind. Rango is a number of things--a feast for the eyes, stimulator of interesting vocabulary, etc.—but it's primarily a fresh experience despite having an assortment of familiar themes and plot devices at its disposal. It's fun for all ages and rewards older movie buffs just as much, if not more so, as its younger viewers. A final note: As a demystified final buff, it's become a rare occasion for me to desire to give a film an immediate second viewing after finishing the first but I instantly wanted to do so with Rango. I hope others, movie maniacs and general audiences alike, get this urge and amount of enjoyment out of the film.

My favorite part about it is the animation and art and how they are bordering on realism. In the scenes that only feature only thr backgrounds, it'd be tough to differentiate between what is a photo and what is CGI.

They wont get the subject matter a lot of the time and will get bored half an hour into it and start fiddling around with whatever else they can find around their chairs.This is an animated movie with some humour, which comes as a secondary to the main storyline of self discovery. The character, through his journey struggles to understand who he is, and through that discovers what helping and loving others can give him in return.Overall its a fun and dry humour movie made for an adult audience. This kind of flick is rare because you can tell it wasn't made to sell toys, it was made to tell a story; unlike anything Pixar churns out.",Rango
255,wilfmckie,Underrated and Ingenious,8,17 November 2020,"Even as a nine-year-old going to see this with my mum on a Friday afternoon after school in 2011, I knew there was something distinct about Rango - all these years on, that opinion remains the same.In what is essentially a David Lynch/Coen brothers flick for younger audiences, this Western adventure displays one of the uncanny and distinct styles in the history of animation. The character and set design, visuals and aesthetics stand out this century as some of the most unique, unconventional and inventive animation yet. Every character has a design that is rich with personality, quirks and imperfect symmetries, the voice cast is spot on perfect, and the comedy, whilst not laugh-out-loud funny, is full of dry moments. Another thing that I was able to distinguish quite young is that, when you rewatch it, Rango is arguably not a children's film, considering the real world guns, murder, explosions, smoking, alcohol, dark gritty themes and mild swears.But where this film really soars is it's message; where most Westerns follow the discovery of redemption, Rango follows the central message of discovering identity. At first, the film seems like your classic imposter story, as the titular character improvises his own new name and creates a new personality for himself on the spot as he tries to fit in with actual people and not the usual lifeless dolls he's been surrounded by his whole life. But there's more to the film than that: everyone reaches a time in their lives where they have an existential moment of awakening, where everything they once adored and needed fades away and they understand who they are, that it's not all about them, and we have to make our own meaning of our lives. As Rango gets ousted from the town after his ruse exposed, he wanders through the desert back to the highway he started at, the small toys that were his life still there and offering little comfort. He disparagingly concludes ""I'm nobody"" and makes a heartbroken crossing of the busy road to the other side, his purpose and place in the world nonexistent. Yet by some divine decision, he doesn't get run over by any oblivious car or truck and makes it to the other side - metaphorically and literally. There he meets the Spirit of the West, a Clint Eastwood parody, who encourages him to be the hero he needed to be for his friends, not himself, and finish what he begun for their sake - ""no man can walk out on his own story."" We all have our own journeys, our own tales, but everything isn't about us. It comes down to what we do in this world, for others and for the greater good.Despite a simple plot, Rango is the most surreal and uniquely animated film I've ever come across in my life, and it deserves to stand the test of time for its complex animation, bold creativity and bizarre imaginative style.",Rango
256,guiltron,A beautifully ugly tale,8,13 April 2011,"Rango is the first fully computer animated film from the special effects production company, Industrial Light and Magic. They enter an arena occupied by two well known heavy weights, Pixar and Dreamworks. Fair to say, ILM definitely have a hit on their hands. Director, Gore Verbinksi has made some very successful films (Mousehunt, The Ring, all the Pirates Of The Caribbean films) and this is his first foray into animation. Rango is a pretty different type of kids film. Firstly, a lot of the images and violence would probably scare the daylights out of kids under ten, and a lot of the film references and themes would go unnoticed by the young. A lot of work has gone into creating characters that look incredibly real. Each mole and hair is carefully detailed and gives the film a unique texture. The overall design is beautifully ugly. It creates an amazingly detailed desert world where everything is incredibly dry and dirty, and it captures it all in a stylish and creative way. On top of having some of the greatest animation around it also boasts a great voice cast. Johnny Depp's charm and quirkiness comes through in voicing Rango and Isla Fisher throws her Aussie accent away for an American Cowgirl voice to create her character, (Rango's love interest) Bean. Alfred Molina, Abigail Breslin, Bill Nighy and Timothy Olyphant also add their voice talents. Those that are familiar with/like westerns will be overloaded with the amount of film references. On occasion, it even comes across as slightly smug and annoying with the amount of 'look-how-smart-we-are' moments there are. Also, the story is not really original and it doesn't really carry the emotional weight that Pixar films do. Still, this fun and smart animated western has a hell of a lot going for it.",Rango
257,hotemeile,Watch out Pixar!,10,28 January 2012,"I approached this movie with caution. I anticipated entertainment from reading some reviews, but was weary as always of its blockbuster character. Let's be honest: Nickelodeon has been consistently pouring out terrible movies; Gore Verbinski has yet to prove himself outside the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise; John Logan, despite all his brilliance in other screenplays, hasn't shown to be at the same level with animation, as his work in Sinbad attests to. So, critical acclaim aside, i wasn't convinced...But scratch all that! This is a new age for Nickelodeon, a defining moment for Verbinski and a testament to Logan's literary genius.Rango has everything: masterful CGI, impeccable storytelling, radiating creativity, surgical attention to detail, humility, depth, vision; and almost none of the usual handicaps, clichés and mistakes of the genre. And let's not forget humor, a cascading, gushing, showering deluge of humor: meta humor, black humor, adult humor, satire, parody, and of course, potty humor. But its crowning moment is its referential humor, its homages - the Spirit of the West, the Fear & Loathing... All beautifully interwoven into the story in a way that separates it from what so many mash-up comedies try to do (and fail horribly).The western genre is made fun of repeatedly, but never is it ridiculed or tarnished. It's a story made with love and admiration for its themes. A wondrous thing in this cynical world and a rarity amid comedy. Humanity is reflected perfectly in this fable. And viscerally. With all its flaws and weaknesses, and all its charms and achievements. And despite the many anecdotes, despite the myriad caricatures, it's never shallow, never false. It remains true to its principles and offers as many laughs as lessons. And by that, i am truly amazed.",Rango

262,indyfreak51,Disney and Pixar have some competition this year.,10,15 March 2011,"I can describe how much this movie blew my mind. Disney and Pixar's movies have stole the show with Toy Story 3 last year. This year, so far the crown has to go to Paramount Pictures and Nickoloden Studios for this gem. Johnny Depp stars as Rango, a chameleon that has a bit of an identity crisis. Like he doesn't know who exactly what he is destined to be. One day when he gets stranded out of the middle of the desert after his owners leave the window open of the back of the car and he tries to find some water.After escaping a hawk, he comes encounter with Beans voiced by Isla Fisher that has occasional moments where she freezes like a statue. She takes Rango to the city called ""Dirt"" which has gone to waste since their lack of water. And after Rango kills defeats the hawk, he is named town Sheriff by the mayor voiced by Ned Betty. One day, after the water bank has been stolen by prospectors, Rango and the gang set off to go and see where all the water is going to.This is probably one of the most violent kid movies I've seen. People getting shot at and drowned to death, and the use of the word that references ""Dang"" and ""Heck"". But that didn't take away what I loved about this movie one bit. This movie was not afraid to be weird and do things that a kids movie wouldn't do. I think this movie was one of Gore Verbinski's best works since the first 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies. And this movie should impress all you western movie fans out there. This is a definite full price movie and this is something you don't want to miss out on. Cars 2, Kung Fu Panda 2, and Puss in Boots better wow me, because Rango is the best animated movie this year so far.",Rango
263,leenarete,Even Animals are Suffering,7,13 June 2011,"Johnny Depp is one of the best actors in Hollywood and he doesn't disappoint in Rango. His voice for the main character who is a chameleon gives the perfect touch to a simple 'human' story. Yes, water is the most precious resource we have and it is being exploited by Governments, Politicians and even sometimes the Water Suppliers. Right here in Kenya, the Cities such as Nairobi and Mombasa have a reasonably steady supply of water but when it runs dry, it really does. Watching Rango unravel the mystery of the low supply and facing his inner doubts is exactly where most of us are at with such matters or simple things in life. It is hard to believe you can make anything happen, because you are 'somebody'. Hats off to the creators and technicians that make an expression of the eyes of chameleon or the rattlesnake send shivers down your spine. This is as real as it gets. For me, the message of water, self-confidence and a simple life is what Rango showed me. Friends can be earned and respected but greed will never pay for anything.",Rango
264,barker_dl,Among the best animated features,10,30 October 2018,"First, Rango is not for a child who's not in school yet, or for that matter a child who's under about 8, with some variation based on the intelligence level of the child. I personally don't feel there's anything that is just WRONG for a child to watch, and the PG rating is appropriate, vs. PG-13. Most of the humor though won't be understood by a child not exposed to various humor, and a bit of the humor requires an adult mind. Consequently it makes great viewing for adults or a family, or kids near or in their teens.The imagery of Rango is OUTSTANDING, and I feel the CGI is better than other animated movies, with maybe one or two exceptions where they may be on the same level, and IMO the CGI rivals that of the best blockbuster movies, of any genre.The storyline isn't complicated, and it doesn't need to be; the journey along the storyline is everything.If you allow yourself the pleasure, you will laugh or at least smile most your way through the movie, but if you start the movie with an overly critical mind, you'll find your reasons to criticize. I recommend easing up a bit of that critical part of you, and enjoy.",Rango
265,alixj248,"A Wonderful Western with Mature Themes, Brilliant Music, Colourful Characters and Great Animation",9,18 May 2015,"What do you get if you cross Johnny Depp,with a lizard and a trippy journey with Western homages in a huge leap for the animation industry? Well, you would get the strangest punchline ever. That is basically Rango. A series of incredible shots and angles by Direvtor Gore Verbinski, as well as tributes to the greats such as Chinatown, The Good the Bad and the Ugly, The Hills Have Eyes, Apocalypse Now and even the strange and bizarre Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with the added cameo of Raoul Puke. The film follows a pet chameleon who falls out of the back of a car in a road accident and runs into an armadillo who directs hi, to the town of Dirt, a small settlement in the middle of the Mojave desert in Nevada. There he meets a host of other creatures like the fiery tongued, intelligent female iguana, Beans, an adorable cactus mouse Priscilla who is obsessed with death and many others all of whom are tough, adapted and not so trusting of strangers- until he spins a lie that he is a hero of the West named Rango, through his love of character acting and thespians. However, becoming the town's new sheriff isn't as fun and rewarding as most would think. The regular thugs such as Bad Bill the gila monster and his furry gang, and a clan of water thieves as well as the dangerous outlaw Rattlesnake Jake threatening to come to town, Rango has his work cut out for him. On top of solving the town's drought problem, finding a way for Beans to keep her ranch and convincing his new friends he's as tough as he talks he must also go on a journey of self discovery and break his existential crisis and live up to his new identity. Rango is a fantastic film for many reasons. The animation to begin with is just Gorgeous. Beautifully done with it's realistic detail in fur, scales, facial expressions and setting. The actors for the film actually came in to the studio for 20 days to act out some of the scenes with costumes and props so the animators could use it as a reference-but this is far from the awkward and slightly disturbing method of motion capture that we've seen in films such as Polar Express and Mars Needs Moms. It's the movement and facial expressions that make the characters look so live action and yet so cartoony. The main character himself is not a good role model, but he isn't a bad one either. He lies, makes bad choices but it's usually not his intent. He is just trying to find out who he is. The love interest Beans is a sharp and clever lead with a soft side. A rancher who is prone to a ""defence mechanism"" of catatonia which is common in many lizards. She and Rango share the usual banter especially as she views him as very untrustworthy and a bit of a wuss at first before warming up to him after some days together with a posse on the hunt for water bandits. The side characters are memorable and funny. Anthropomorphic animals such as toads, chickens, frogs, lizards, rabbits, squirrels, owls, mice moles and rats who all have their moments. The main villain is the turtle Mayor John who wants to control the water for his own intentions. The real treat is the incredibly amazing gun-slinger Rattlesnake Jake, who's appearance is based off of Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes. From his slithering movements, hellfire eyes, Gatling gun rattle and an awesome black hat, Jake's reveal is brilliantly done, with the added poison honey of Bill Nighy using a similar technique from his Davy Jones role in Pirates of the Caribbean. The shots in this movie are beautiful. From the setting sunsets to the time lapse of dusk to night to the close ups of opening and closing cactus flowers and our character walking solemnly against a bright silver full moon. The themes Rango takes on are heavy and sometimes overly adult. I would NOT recommend this as a movie for young children. I would say 12 and up is a suitable age, as it leans more towards a teen and adult audience. It's a PG but honestly I would rate it 12a or PG-13. There are LOTS of violent scenes with guns, threats and attacks as well as a knife being pulled at one point. Although no blood is shown you keep expecting them to take that road. There is also swearing, minor like ""damn,"" ""hell"" ""shit"" ""son of a bitch,"" but it's not too frequent. There are also some sexual references and anatomical words used as well as a sign reading ""Soiled Dove"" an obvious yet subtle reference to the brothels of the Old West. There are scenes of drinking and smoking as well as spitting but, hey. It's the old west and it wouldn't be a western without those things. I congratulate every single person who worked on Rango, and I eagerly await a sequel if one is in the works.",Rango

The mix of silly or intelligent hybrid jokes, weird characters and animal relationships in a harsh desert environment made me stay. Rango had a pretty boring but good life; he didn't know it until tragedy struck upon him and he ended up in a survival situation that forced him to adapt very quickly. Intelligent and willing to survive no matter what, he becomes the hero and subsequently the sheriff of a desperate city. I chose to see the extended version and i can't imagine a shorter one. The special features are very interesting introducing the viewers in the real world of each character, sort of National Geographic or Steve Irwin style.

The storyline is not too original, but it is the western setting that made it stand out ! It goes as one of the best looking animated movies I have ever seen along with How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story 3! If you haven't seen the way Gore Verbinski animated this movie watch THIS because it really is the reason the visuals are so fantastic ! The voice acting is great from every actor! I loved seeing the voice of Ned Beatty used, he voiced Lotso in Toy Story 3, and he voices the mayor in Rango. As I said the storyline is not very original, but it's the setting that really makes the movie great! After seeing How to Train Your Dragon, Toy Story 3, and now Rango I look forward to animated movies in the future!

273,amason-6,A complete waste of time and money!!!!!,1,13 March 2011,"I wish i'd read reviews before i went to see this - but i like to form my own opinions. It's animated, it's PG - should be entertaining, right? WRONG!!! My husband and i saw Rango today - when we left the theater we both looked at each other and said ""i didn't like it"". I will give credit to the animation, but little else.I agree with other reviews on many points. Not a family movie, not a kids movie, not funny, boring, and unlikable and undeveloped characters. I actually found myself resting my head in my hand and wishing the movie would end. I kept looking around at other adults who seemed just as bored as i was. I felt sorry for the kids in the theater - they weren't laughing and i think much of the movie was hard for them to understand. The characters hardly grow or develop, so i found myself not really caring what happened to them.What disturbs me most about Rango are the dark undertones which run throughout the movie. I'm not a prude, but i would not take kids to this movie. If i were a young child watching the movie, the large rattlesnake which filled the screen many times would have really scared me. What bothers me is that this is offered as family entertainment. The lead female character telling the snake to ""go to Hell""? And the serpent, with glowing eyes looking like evil personified, replying ""where do you think i come from?"" HELLO???!!! There are many people who take heaven and hell, and God and Satan seriously - not something to joke about.Wake up people - this is NOT entertainment - and it certainly is not for young children. Give me UP, or CARS or FINDING NEMO any day! Are we so desensitized to violence and evil that we don't even see it anymore when it's right in front of our faces? This movie was a waste of time and money - my only regret is that we didn't get our money back and walk out. I kept hoping Rango would get better or somehow redeem itself. It never did.

Best thing about Rango is the voice over of Johnny Depp. It's very funny and engaging. It will not only entertain the kids, but it will be enjoyed by the adults as it's very meaningful. It's a complete package of comedy, action, drama and romance.Like everybody Rango has been looking for his identity for a while. Life gives everyone a chance to be a hero. Some can actually be a hero, but most of the people remain as ordinary persons. It's the story of Rango who will have the chance to prove his heroism.

It was very crowded at the cinema and I had to sit at the very front and I only ordered a small popcorn that was finished around the beginning of the movie, but even without all of that i still don't think i would have enjoyed this movie.The story was very bland and followed the overdone and boring formula of a newcomer in a town lying about his past, becoming an unlikely hero, being revealed for who he really is, get turned on by the townsfolk only to return to save the day. Sure, the animation was a fresh breath in comparison to other recent animated films but that only takes it so far.After the movie I went to Burger King, I had a tender-grilled chicken burger with a coke and fries, my burger was not unlike the movie very bland, I usually don't eat my fries with ketchup but for some reason during this visit to Burger King I felt like it. As I had already seated myself I didn't feel like getting up again to get the ketchup and just like the movie and the burger my entire meal felt very bland.If you're looking for a mindless film to watch, go here.

It was a relief to have finally viewed a proper movie this year, especially after having to sit through the travesty that was Sucker Punch. Anyways...This movie does well in its environment in giving both Pixar and DreamWorks a proper run for their money this year in the Oscar contenders for Best Animated Film. It is both beautiful to look at in every aspect and angle. No expense was spared to give the audience a systematic treat of characters, environment, and an overall western feel that younger audiences will enjoy...though not too much younger.Johnny Depp once again reminds us why he is such a great actor, that you don't have to see Depp to feel his brilliance. Verbinski brings another tale that though it resembles elements of his previous films (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean), it still stands on its own as a fun film worthy of his name.It did drag slightly towards the end, but like all great westerns, they give the audience action, great dialog, heart, and fun characters that look like they've been out in the sun for too long (the point I believe).I will definitely be purchasing this film when it comes out on DVD and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the classic westerns of Wayne and Eastwood. 9/10",Rango

I'm going to skip how the plot doesn't make sense, or how the ""bad guy"" rattlesnake doesn't get any comeuppance, or any of the other zillion plot holes, and I'll concentrate on the character. In particular, I didn't feel that the title character was interesting at all - In the beginning he was just a wannabe actor. But by the end he was... well, the sheriff, but all it took to change him was a chat with Clint Eastwood. There was no real catharsis.

Maybe I'm used to the wit of Shrek or the pure enjoyment of Cars but Rango was not like either of these (beyond some stunning visuals).First, as others have said, do not bring your kids. Owls hanging from nooses, the same owls continually reassuring you the hero will die, at least one fairly realistic gunning down of a character and quite a bit of death overall. Combine that with the threats of ""I want to watch your eyes as I kill you"" and references to some adult topics (likely over a kids head, but still) and you have a non-kid movie. I would say the big thing is that they really do show death whereas typically it is only alluded to or the characters don't die.Beyond the kid factor, I thought the movie was highly predictable and overall just awkward. At many times it just felt overly drawn out. I think if a person was a huge spaghetti western fan there may be some material here for you, but not for the typical movie goer.In the world of bad westerns and parodies of the genre I feel like this landed more toward the former even if aiming for the latter.",Rango

I read the reviews and saw the previews and went to see this horrible excuse for a Pixar knock-off. If anyone here is expecting something clever you can forget it. There's very few funny lines except for the previews you saw which made you want to come in the first place. There's an unimaginative reference throughout to a well-known classic film. I hope it isn't supposed to be an homage because it seems more like a second class ripoff. There are pedestrian references to other films as well. Typical of mainstream Hollywood's lack of imagination today. The movie is so boring I actually found myself falling asleep. Which hasn't happened since I made the mistake of attending an opera. Lest you think I'm alone in this opinion my wife said she found herself falling asleep as well and when she turned to tell me, while in the movie, saw that I was dozing. The animation is top-notch but it should be in this day and age. The script is so poor it never ceases to amaze me how today's screenwriters get work. I've written better blindfolded. Verbinski's success at the box office with the Pirates franchise has the Suits in Hollywood fooled into thinking that he can actually direct well. His pacing in this terrible movie is made for an audience of snails. Johnny Depp who is always great has nothing to work with here. Sad waste of his talent as it was for all the actors here who do the best with what little they were given. I'm giving it 3 stars for the animation alone and the Los Lobos theme song.

284,bdub640,Rango Review by Brian!,7,10 March 2011,"On Saturday I was able to see a screening of the new movie Rango. This movie is directed by Gore Verbinski (Pirates Trilogy, The Weather Man) and stars Johnny Depp along side an all- star cast.The plot is as follows""Rango is a pet chameleon who lives in a terrarium. He has long thought himself a hero, but then finds himself removed from his contemporary American southwest surroundings and ending up in an Old West town called Dirt, which is populated by various desert critters garbed like characters out of a Western. As he's always thought himself a hero, Rango establishes himself as the lawman, strolling the streets as a sheriff-like character. Unknown to him, the ""good guy"" role does not do very well in Dirt, with a cemetery filled with good- guy tombstones. But that does not stop Rango from trying, constantly seeking to fit in with his surroundings. In ""an existential crisis"", Rango comes to question everything about himself.""This being an animated movie I have to start by talking about the animation. I was absolutely floored by how good this movie looked. It may be the best animated/CG movies I have seen to date. They even put most of Pixar's movies to shame. After seeing it I did a little bit of research about who did the animation; it turns out it was done by the geniuses at ILM (Industrial Light & Magic). Normally ILM is just a Visual Effects company, this being their first animated feature. Let me say, they knocked it out of the park! The landscape, the character design, and every little detail, down to the amazing fur of the creatures. At some points I could not even believe that I was watching and animated movie.But the story is still the most important part of a movie, unless of course if you are Michael Bay (Rimshot). The story is about Rango who comes into an old west town where they are almost out of water. Rango impresses the town and becomes the Sheriff. He then promises to get the people more water and save their town. While this sounds like a basic plot or easy to follow movie, I have to say regardless of this being an animated movie, or how it is marketed, this is in no way a kid's movie to me. Right off the bat they are throwing around very adult oriented humor.Depp as a whole does a fun job and sounds like he is having fun with the role. If I had to narrow it down I would say Depp is playing Raoul Duke and Jack Sparrow rolled into one, maybe even a little ""Sands"" from Once Upon a Time in Mexico. All that means Depp is quite ""zany"" throughout this movie, which is the best kind of Depp. Honestly I love the character of Jack Sparrow and Depp so I really don't get tired of this. Depp always seems like he is having fun and its why I really don't mind (and am even looking forward to) a fourth Pirates. (Quiet all you naysayers!)The rest of the cast is good as well, which includes Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Ray Winston, & a fantastically fun bit from Timothy Olyphany. Bill Nighy stands out as the mostly memorable role as a villainous snake. His role is short, but Nighy has a great voice for a villainA quick small item that I wanted to point out, as a huge movie nerd, I greatly appreciated the appreciable amount of meta jokes. Another one of Depp's characters makes a little cameo. Then quite possibly the greatest western hero of all time makes a great cameo and speech. (Any guesses?)In the end I enjoyed the movie and had a fun time with it. It's an old tale that we have seen done before, but the animation, actors, using animals instead of humans give this a good modern day twist. This is actually quite the good date night movie. Girls will find it cute and the guys will have enough fun with all the inside humor and adult jokes. Not that it's negative but I would still not call this a kid's movie. I think kids could see it and have fun, but some of the movies charm and special quirks would most likely be lost on them. I would still just see this movie for the amazing animation - ILM always knocks it out of the park!In the end a good 7 out of 10 / BThank you as always and enjoy the movies.",Rango

He meets a lot of interestingly put people. As it seems, a lost lizard, greeted into an old western town, becomes a local, and saves the water supply; to make it short. However, included into the journey is the humor that Johnny Depp brings along with a really cool story, and the characters are super cool and funny too! It had me giggling aloud. I was impressed by the creation and the scene animation if you will. They did a really good job on the scrip and how the story unfolds. It had me guessing and I never knew what to expect. And, there was never really a dull moment. Not to mention, the old Spanish set was spectacular and the music as well.Another high point to the viewing was that it touched not only comedy scenes but also a dramatic take put together with action scenes! I loved it! I truly recommend this movie for all genre driven fans.Ps: Look out for all the catch and find stuff, Hawaiian shirt (hint hint)",Rango
288,wareaglegurl,Great animated movie!,8,5 March 2011,"I went to go see this movie with my family and I definitely enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I mean, don't get me wrong I love Johnny Depp and all, but looked to me like this movie just wouldn't live up to his reputation. I was wrong. The storyline is very well put together, with just enough comedy that's understandable for younger children and just enough action to keep you entertained without having to make the rating PG-13. The character of Rango very much showed traits of Jack Sparrow, probably Depp's most well known character from Pirates of the Caribbean, and was definitely appealing and easy to relate to for the audience (we all want to feel like a hero sometimes!). What blew me away though was the absolutely incredible animation! The characters seem so lifelike and not even the simplest detail is ever forgotten in each scene. Overall, it's a great movie for all ages and I recommend seeing it on your next trip to the theater!",Rango
289,splatterpaint,Go Rango!!!!,10,11 September 2011,"I have nothing but praise for Rango. It was one of the best movies I have seen all year. Definitely on my personal list of top 50 movies. A great movie to see with friends and a great family movie. Both of the friends I went to see it with didn't like it for some dumb reason or another, but I absolutely loved it. I was laughing for weeks after, more than worth the $12 I spent to see it in theaters. I was crying because I was laughing so much.I really enjoyed it, all 107 minutes of it. Rango is such a great character, so dramatic and triumphant. The only thing was that I didn't see much character development on his part. These days it's hard to come across good original comedy, but Rango was original and silly. In the trailer they show the actors acting out the movie, and throughout the movie I pictured the actors as the characters and let me tell you it was hysterically funny and it added to my experience. I also felt that it helped the actors get into character more.",Rango
290,TonnerBowow,Weirdly Charming and Memorable.,9,24 May 2020,"Rango is a widely appraised animated film which had won academy awards and the hearts of many.

This movie was a huge risk because it isn't the most hilarious movie of all time and it's not really geared towards kids. But for me this risk paid off big time. Rich themes, breathtaking animation and character design, and great voice acting to go along with it. Rango is a fantastic film and I would watch it any day of the week.",Rango
292,danielmckinnon,Rango Is Not For Young Children,7,13 March 2011,"Rango is a western that just happens to star animated animals instead of humans. Little kids wouldn't care for westerns, and shouldn't be taken to them for reasons of violence, and they will not find the subject matter interesting.The same logic can be applied here as well.I took my 6 year old daughter to see Rango today, and it became apparent within 5 minutes of the movie that this would not be the ideal film for her, or any other young children. The entire time the movie was playing, kids were talking, barely laughing, and many were obviously bored. It's difficult to summarize quickly what was 'bad' about Rango because it's difficult to do.The Goodthe animation is absolutely top-notch, picture perfect and beautiful - Johnny Depp and other actors did a great job with their performances, probably due to the unique way lines were recorded - tons of inside jokes that referenced other movies (I love the Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas moment)The Badthe story will bore any young child in no time flat, they just won't like it - most laughs are from the inside jokes, I can't remember the theater laughing strongly at any moment - the language is not good for a kid movie; others have complained about ""hell"" being used over and over again, I was unhappy that ""damn"" was used at the end for no good reasonFor adults I recommend Rango but just barely. The story 'should' work better, but there is no clear flow to the film. It feels jagged and rough around the edges, and just doesn't grab you. If you appreciate animation for what it is, then I can lay 5 stars on this. It's a treat for the eyes and will no doubt get you to say ""wow"" several times.I expected a lot more from this movie and it didn't deliver. If the target audience truly is little kids, then higher ups should have intervened long ago. If the audience was adults, then I guess the end result is good, but it's a shame the animation effort was used on a movie that just doesn't hit any home runs.***",Rango
293,Hr4mmer,Animation and Western at its best.,9,20 March 2021,"This movie i can define in three words. Amazing. Funny. and Inspiring.
A well-conducted story about a camaleon who overcame his fears in defense of the people he just met, but has a tremendous relationship.
Usually in animations, the creators tend to make the characters more smootly and visually clean, like they're all perfect, which they don't. We don't see any of that with Rango. All the characters have their own scars , bruises and imperfections that makes us wonder on their past , and how did they get that scars.
Simply this is the best animation i've seen so far.
Academy got it right.",Rango

We had ""Cars 2"", ""Happy Feet 2"", ""Mars Needs Moms"", etc. But among all those bad films, there was one that stood out for its well-written script, its risky visuals and its tribute to the Westerners. Rango is a film full of action and incredible characters. It was hands down the best animated movie of 2011 and I really recommend watching it as soon as possible.",Rango
295,sarkargirik,Underrated but Excellent Movie,9,29 September 2021,"Rango , Its the most underrated movie ever. It is more good than you expected. It deserves the Oscar it got. From The Story to the Graphics, Every thing is so well made. The first 20 minutes is boring but when Rango Is Solving the mystery , it is really interesting and some of the motivational scenes are well made. Music Is also very good. Side Characters are really good. Villain is also Very Intimidating. Overall Good Movie . Definitely deserves its Oscar.",Rango
296,todd1928,Truly Fantastic,9,27 April 2011,"Rango is an animated film that is not directed at children but instead at smart moviegoers who enjoyed the old spaghetti westerns. The film is directed by Gore Verbinski and stars names like Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin and Bill Nighy.Right off the bat you realize that this is something more than a cutesy, talking animal film. The characters look like they have been out in the desert all their life and are immaculately textured to the point that you think it's a Pixar film. The voices are great with each voice actor doing a fantastic job bringing these characters to life. The plot itself is rather interesting as instead of the most valuable resource being money it is water (something that has become increasingly rare in the town of Dirt).The film centers around a domesticated pet chameleon(Johnny Depp) that gets separated from his owners in the middle of the Mojave Desert and in turn creates himself a new identity (seemingly modeled after Clint Eastwood) named Rango. While that may seem rather unoriginal you have never seen the ""new place, new identity"" gimmick done like this.The landscape is beautiful, the enemies are great and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to the film (there is a fantastic version of ride of the Valkyries). The film is packed with satirical humor that helps to keep the film fresh and helps the elements of the film to come together perfectly and you can tell that everyone was on the same page when they made this film.This film is a beautiful tribute to the Spaghetti Westerns and a must see film this year.",Rango
297,werkis2002,Unfortunately i was disappointed by Rango - its a boring and unfunny movie !,1,22 March 2011,"Im not strict and big critic to movies. I have enjoyed some of low rated movies but Rango didn't make trough for me - even it have 7.8 stars I'm not in people category who like this movie so this movie probably will not have success in Europe !!! Rango jokes was lame ! Im so disappointed even Johny Depp dint worked for me in this movie this time and i know he have saved many bad movies ...Animation are very good in this movie i always honor good CGI in movie and also music but i don't like music into this one.My good friend took kids to Rango because we all suggested to her it over Mars need moms and because there wasn't other movies to go see ! But she was very disappointed about this movie and she said it was boring by the way she not from Europe !!!And now i know why she didn't liked it ! Now I'm also disappointed as she, even more cause i am big Johny Depp fanatic.Also characters i didn't like in Rango .And most of jokes i have seen and heard before so anymore not funny for me.Pants falling down thats 1000 years old joke !As much i wished this movie to be better, i really can give it only 3 stars honestly, but for others who haven't seen yet 100 years old jokes and like lame humor i suggest to go see Rango !",Rango
298,PapaRock145,Solid Family Movie,7,4 February 2013,"Rango is overall a very entertaining and fun family movie. It is a beautifully looking film, the character designs are all very cool. They are all detailed and fun to watch. The story is also pretty good. The town of Dirt has run out of water and it is up to the stranger Rango to help this town and to prove to himself that he is valuable. The characters in the town of Dirt are all memorable and provided some very cool characters (Spoons and Rattlesnake Jake in particular) It is a film that I think both parents and kids will enjoy and a film that deserves a lot of recognition. There is also a special cameo-type roll towards the end of the movie that you will not want to miss!",Rango
299,aprilhaynes,"Really engaging movie (and yes, even for the 7 year old)!!",8,14 March 2011,"So, I've seen a lot out there about parents getting' their bloomers in a bunch about this movie not being ""kid-friendly."" I have one response to that: bull. Sure, the word ""he!!"" is tossed around a few times, and a few others, but why in the world is that a problem for your kid? Ask my seven year old when he can start cursing, and he'll tell you ""When I'm 18."" Ask him when he can start drinking, and he'll say ""When I'm 21."" Will he do both earlier? Probably, but seeing ""Rango"" is not the cause. I also saw a parent's review that said the movie was all about 'death,' and therefore also not appropriate for kids. Death is the only certainty in the world, and I don't understand how talk of death isn't appropriate for kids. Best expose them now to it (on an acceptable level) so that they're not totally spun out when it touches their young lives.Back to the movie--it was a wonderful amalgam of so many Westerns that I've seen, but it doesn't end there. Hunter S. Thompson, for example, makes a brief appearance in the first 10 minutes of the movie! There are glorious pop culture references and jokes throughout the entire movie, which kept my 40-year old a$$ very amused and engaged.The seven year old didn't get those references--but he truly loved the story line, and the visuals were stunning to him. He was saying lines from it the rest of the day, and we both got a chuckle out of some of the scenes. Whoever cast this movie did a wonderful job--and I didn't even recognize Isla Fisher's voice at all.If you want some entertainment, take the whole family with you. I can see all ages enjoying this flick!",Rango
300,mbowles64,A Great Adventure for the Whole Family,9,13 August 2011,"Sometimes by brothers insistence surprises me and Rango was one of these cases. It was a late afternoon and my brother had rented Rango which i was already familiar with because of its star studded cast and impressive review. So after much argument over the television i gave in to watch this movie.I was truly hoping to be impressed and my wish was to be fulfilled in the first half an hour into the movie. Rango is about a Travelling Pet Lizard who is separated from his owners to be stranded in the middle of the Mojave Desert. He then after certain circumstances ends up in a small old western styled town called Dirt. He soon discovers that this rough and rugged town is in a major Water crisis. The problem seems simple until Rango becomes sheriff of the town through his overwhelming acting abilities, immersing himself into the mystery and adventure of the crisis making new friends along the way.This movies plot is wonderfully simple creating a comfort for the viewer. The humor contained in the movie is extremely well timed and adds the perfection towards the strange and wonderful character developed through out the film. Setting and visuals are beautiful and voice casting was flawless. Johnny Depp as Rango is up to his usual Brilliance accompanied by actors and actresses such as Bill Nighy and Isla fisher.The reason why i loved this movie was because it surprised me and its non stop action an the occasional laughs making it perfect for all ages. I give this movie 8 out of 10",Rango
301,thosefries,Sorry....,3,21 August 2011,"I saw all these good reviews, and I just came to put in my opinion. Personally, I was not impressed by this movie. First, the plot was just plain dry. It was missing that kick of sugar. I mean, people, not being able to find water. Who made up this plot? Because I was not excited, scared or feeling any emotions during this movie. All I was feeling was boredness. At the time, I had not seen many other movies with Johnny Depp. Just one. That was the 2010 remake of ""Alice in Wonderland."" I was blown away by his performance. My friend had seen his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies and loved them. I believed in him. Then, I saw this. I mean, it is aimed at kids yet, they said he** and one of the characters started to say the b word but was blocked out by another noise in the movie. Then, there was that snake. He was totally scary. I was even a little freaked. Then, there were guns? In what kids movie is there guns?! Anyway, this has been the worst Nickelodeon movie I have seen in my life.",Rango
302,angedemo16,I prefer Fear and Loathing better.,5,27 June 2012,"Don't get me wrong. This was a gorgeous movie. The computer animation was stunning, and it was nice to hear Johnny Depp going back to something oddly familiar.In fact, a little too familiar.I thought this movie was meant for kids. As I was watching it with my niece, I found out I was wrong. This movie reminds me of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with a little mix of American Tale: Fifal goes West.That's it. There is nothing else I could think of to say about this movie. I honestly don't care if this review isn't helpful, the movie wasn't worth it.Don't make a kid's movie for adults.",Rango

304,sallysunrise,So bad that we walked out,1,28 March 2011,"This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The animation was just OK. Although it was realistic looking, the subject matter had no appeal. I thought the movie was going to be funny, but it was devoid of humor, unless you find road kill to be amusing. This movie was exceedingly boring, grim, unpleasant, pointless, and somewhat offensive. I feel especially sorry for all the families with children that showed up to see this downer of a film. The audience sat in stony silence throughout the film. (Probably some people were asleep.) After enduring this movie for about 1 hour, my husband and I finally walked out of the theater--wish we had left sooner. We don't know how the movie ended and we couldn't care less.",Rango

Good movie. ;) This was the Best Animated Film ever! Rango deserves this good rating. and my favorite scene was when the Hawk got killed by that big water tower when it landed on him. LOL! and also a few more things i would recommend this movie who looks good animated films such as this one. so anyways this was a good movie i senn so far and Rango is a good movie would enjoy to anyone who hasn't heard or seen this movie.,Rango

I liked the western setting, Rango's lies and his socially awkward personality and his arc when he reached his lowest point. I like the towns folks and their designs. Animation was good.

I expected a Great storyline in a movie starring Johnny Depp. However the story was, at times, slow. I would imagine someone told Depp to ""slow down the dialog"", probably for the children's delicate comprehension. What this movie does do well is; in your face - awesomely gruesome - computer animation detail. I don't want to spoil anything, but there were times I started feeling queasy in my stomach as I am the type to look away when passing road kill. Still okay for children though, they will probably find it funny if they can sit through the slow scenes. If bringing your kids, go to the matinée and save some money, otherwise wait for the DVD.",Rango

People will say its a bad comedy just because they expect its a comedy. Its not. This movie is a good drama. Try to understand the metaphor, the message. This movie is our reality like in George Orwell's animal farm.Ill give it just an 8 and not higher because of the Hollywood boring and predictable ending.",Rango
310,ohrid,Simple,7,22 March 2011,"I had been looking forward ""Rango""'s premiere for a long time. I was expecting it in 3D, but if the film is very good, 3D is not a big deal. This film is first of all for the western lovers. It tells fantastic story of a little chameleon, who happened to be thrown in the middle of the desert. He founds a village (ranch), where he meets new friends and new enemies instead of his past friends: clockwork fish and a half-bodied mannequin of a girl. The first part of the film is devoted to the Rango's handling with new environment, his making new friends. The main events of the film are happening in desert, where the main squad of ""good"" heroes, headed by Rango trying to find some water for their thirst village. I find this part some kind of boring. There is a part similar to the large quantity of films: chases, fights etc. I would like to distinguish the ugliness and visual enormity of all of the heroes in the movie. While the other studious are trying to do their characters funny and amusing, here we see almost vomitive heroes notwithstanding the Rango only. As for me, Rango was one only hero, who was making fun and entertaining the public. There are present some adult jokes, lame and odd, no one of the audience was laughing. I may mark a nice music accompaniment by the Mexican owls, they where pleasant and funny. So, this film deserves for attention, but there are a lot of better animations. It's very unusual for the minute, but I can't say lucky unusual. I was expecting more.",Rango

Insiting on getting some water, Roadkill points the Lizard towards the town Dirt in the middle of the desert. While making his way through the desert he encounters numerous things like Hawks, trees that stare at you, a rock like creature and a mariachi band made of birds.Soon in the desert, the lizard, meets up with Beans (Isla Fisher)an independent girl that is struggling to keep her father's ranch. She takes him the rest of the way to Dirt where he walks into the local bar where at first he is harassed by the locals but being the Thespian that he is he quickly comes up with a character and a name, Rango. Rango tells the locals of how he took out the 7 Jenkin Brothers with one bullet. Soon, Rango's stories get him into a draw with some of the bullies of Dirt which is interrupted with an attack by a hawk. Rango soon kills the bird and like in his stories and with a little luck he kills the bird with one bullet. After this heroic event, Rango is promoted to Sheriff of the town and then is assigned to find out where the water supply is going. This leads him to a number of action, duologue and sweet scenes with Rango and his Posse. When they get back to Town to no prevail, the water is completely gone. Rango has now had suspicions that the culprit of water supply is the Mayor (Ned Beatty). Now threatened, The Mayor calls in Rattle Snake Jake (Bill Nighy) who exiles Rango into the desert.Rango makes his way back to the road where he decides that he must cross the road. When he makes it he has an encounter with The Spirit of the West. After taking his advice, Rango makes his way back to Dirt to save the day. After putting the pieces of the puzzle together Rango learns of the plan to destroy Dirt and comes up with a plan to save the Town. He then takes down the evil doers and saves dirt, becoming the permanent Sheriff of Dirt. Sheriff Rango.When I went into this movie I had expectations, I was not disappointed! This movie was awesome. We definitely have a movie in the running for best animated movie of 2011. Where to begin? The Story, Overall the story was a refreshing one. It was in the formula of a western where you have slower scenes and then action sequences. It was balanced out perfectly. There was a lot of humor in the movie which was great because again there was a lot of it that was aimed towards older people and some who speak another language which i thought was great. Overall i think the story was bold and a lot of metaphoric parts of the story too. This story like I said was refreshing and definitely a 5/5.The Characters, all of the characters were great and fun to watch and look at. They all had great details and unique designs to them. My favorite was probably Rattle Snake Jake. They all were entertaining and made the movie very enjoyable. 5/5. The animation: WOW!! What can i say? I was blown away by the animation. It was probably the most impressive animation in a film I've ever seen (next to Toy Story 3). Before the movie there was a trailer for Hoodwinked 2. That animation look horrible and made Rango look a lot more cool. There was so much eye candy in the film and soooooo much detail.Being someone who appreciates this kind of stuff this was awesome. 6/5 Overall the movie was great, the only thing i had a little problem with was the fact that Rattle Snake Jake's screen time wasn't a lot but the same fact also made him even more awesome. The movie was awesome and was definitely not just for kids. In fact that was another thing. I thought the movie towards the end, the movie got a little dark and overall i think the movie would have kept kids from age 0 - 7 may be bored or scared. Kids from age 8 - adults will love it. This movie was bold in that way though which was awesome and proof that animated films are not just for kids. Rango 10/10",Rango
312,wct443,See this in theaters!,10,12 March 2011,"This movie was no doubt one of the most visually captivating films I have ever seen. The animation was stellar. Simply amazing. There were a few shots done so well it literally took my breath away. Maybe this was because I saw it on the big screen. And with that thought, I advise everyone to see this movie at a theater before it leaves cinemas. It was visually stimulating the entire time, filled with realistic lighting effects and some amazing sets.But was the story good? Well, I would say that yes it was. It was very interesting to see a classic Western plot unfold in an animated form. About halfway through the movie, while the characters share a tender moment, I realized that I really did care for these oddball animals. I think I liked the supporting roles the most. Seeing them all ride across the sunset was such an unbelievable moment.I came to this film expected a quirky comedy about not fitting in. What I got was a movie fit to call itself a great Western. And please, everyone, see this on the big screen! It will take your breath away!",Rango
313,Scannain_com,"Great animation coupled with strong characters, a good story and an inspired score, there's a lot to love here.",9,3 March 2011,"8 years ago Gore Verbinski teamed up with Johnny Depp to make a movie that no-one in their right mind thought was going to be a success. Pirate movies were dead and buried and it took the monumental success of Verbinski and Depp's first endeavour to show that genre movies can work, if the source material is good enough. 8 years later Pirates 4 sails over the horizon, Verbinski has walked the plank following the disappointing story-telling of Pirates 2 and 3, and Depp has just made The Tourist. Suffice to say that the two of them could do with a hit right now, but is an animated western really the way to goRango tells the story of a chameleon called, well we never actually find that out, who lives a solitary existence in a terrarium. Starved for companionship he survives the days by using his fertile imagination to act out plays and create scenarios utilising a clockwork fish and a decapitated doll. Suddenly he falls from a moving car and lands in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Seeking refuge he happens upon the old desert town of Dirt, a town populated with a cacophony of desert creatures living a meagre existence in the harsh environs. Using his anonymity he fashions himself as a gunslinger, tells a fantastical story of bravery and bravado and winds up becoming the local sheriff. It soon becomes clear however that all is not well in this quite little town and pretty soon Rango is going to be called into action.The characters in Rango are magnificent. There's at least 20 different desert critters each with their own unique character and personality, each interesting and worthy of their own moment in the sun. That in itself is a wondrous feat of film-making. The star of the show is of course the Johnny Depp voiced Rango. Depp imbues Rango with a vibrancy, urgency and nagging self-doubt of a guy who knows his entire persona is built on a crumbling deck-of-cards. Depp inhabits the character, causing the audience to forget that he's providing the voice and allowing Rango to become the star. Isla Fisher does a strong quirky turn as Beans, her accent is spot on and her comic sensibility very much to the forefront. Ned Beatty does a villain well, his Lotso in Toy Story 3 was perhaps better but he's still solid here. Bill Nighy's Rattlesnake Jake is the prototypical Western bad-guy and Nighy gives a suitably evil performance. As good as Depp is though there is one better, Abigail Breslin as Priscilla. Sombre, morose, sweet and more than a little scary her proclamations and utterations give weight and substance to the plight of this poor town. She is the essence of why Rango must win out. Oh and the Mariachi band are brilliant.The animation is superb. It's fluid and dynamic and shows that 2D is not quite dead yet when it comes to drawing a story. Visually sumptuous the Roger Deakins' inspired cinematography captures the west in a manner that compares favourably to Deakins own Oscar nominated turn in True Grit. This movie marks Industrial Light and Magic's first foray into animation, and if they can continue in this mould Pixar is about to get serious competition. There's an aerial assault/chase sequence here that is simply something special. John Logan's script is peppered with movie references and homages that offer something to hardcore cinema-goers and yet never distract from the tale. Sure the plot itself could be the basis of any Western but there's dialogue and discourse enough to elevate it from the dust and allow Verbinski a platform for greatness. And then there's Hans Zimmer's score Referencing Ennio Morricone's classic work and adding a twist the soundtrack here will have you humming long after you leave the cinema.Great animation coupled with strong characters, a good story and an inspired score, there's a lot to love here. Even with some minor flaws too trivial to mention Rango is top-class entertainment.",Rango
314,jaehns,Disappointing,3,17 March 2011,"I was so excited to see this movie. I have a 7 and 8 year old and they are in to cowboys right now. My husband is a huge western movie buff, so we thought it would be a great flick to go see together. Boy was I disappointed. We all were.I went expecting to see a fast paced, funny, western cartoon. I think the only thing out of those three I got was the western cartoon. This movie is not geared towards kids. However, the advertising, the animation, and all the previews I saw were! I *think* that they may have been going for the next ""Up"" style movie. Where they are trying to create an entertaining movie for kids and adults with a much deeper message. I got the message, but missed the entertaining part. The other option is that they were trying to create a really bad, boring western. If so, they succeeded! The animation is good. Some of the characters are a little weird to look at, but when you're trying to humanize lizards and such, I guess they are going to look a little weird. I also thought the sound effects were well done. The storyline has so much potential, but the movie is about 30 minutes too long. Because it was so boring, the kids in the nearly sold out theater were antsy and loud the last half of the movie which did not help the experience much. You really couldn't blame them, though.Really bummed about it, we had looked forward to Rango since we originally saw it advertised in December. The kids didn't enjoy it, the western movie buff husband didn't enjoy it, and neither did I. I did, however, leave the theater really wanting a drink of water!!!",Rango

There were times that this movie looked 100 percent photo real. outstanding job modeling and texturing and lighting on this. the little tiny attention to detail in the world you guys built had my wife and I in awe throughout most the movie. The animation was fun and eccentric. Over the top but at times subtle and felt meaningful. The only little nit pick was the mouths on some of the characters. in the attempt to make the animals look more like the animals they were representing the mouths were quite small and at times the sync was a bit odd. Though it provided for some goofy looking characters that were fun.at just over an hour and a half, at times it felt it was a little too slow paced. well, that was my wife's critique. I looked at it more so that they were going for the slower feel of some classic westerns. I thought the long stretches of little dialog, epic music and visuals, and great cinematography worked in the films favor.The crowd dug it too. I think the youngest person in the theater was about 6 (which i found odd for a late night screening, but whatever) and the oldest was probably in their 70's and everyone was engaged.I was kind of surprised what they could get away with in a PG rated movie. Im no prude or anything, but there were enough adult jokes snuck in there to give me the giggle fits. Couple of lite swear words, references to more... ehem, adult type themes, but overall pretty tame and enjoyable.Hats off. If this doesn't win awards I don't know what I believe in anymore. This is one of the more entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.",Rango

(Rango, ""Are those real??"") And the language...all that mumbled Western lingo a' la ""True Grit"" with Mexican accent was supposed to be comprehensible to young kids?? Gimme a break. I'll stick with Toy Story 3 and Finding Nemo for true family entertainment. In the theater I was in, kids were screaming and crying during the entire movie, obviously traumatized by the ugly rodents and violence they saw on screen. About Johnny Depp's voice over for Rango, I have to say this has to be the most overrated actor currently working in Hollywood. What ever happened to alpha male actors of yore like Gable, Bogart, Cooper, Peck...? Today they're all emaciated/girly-man looking boy scouts like Depp, DiCaprio and such. Basta!",Rango

319,leonaraujo,"perfect characters, perfect soundtrack perfect animation, perfect story and perfect movie",10,28 July 2019,"Rango in many ways exceeds Pixar animation, the characters are very distinctive and, although they are cartoony, they are incredibly well done, the scales, fur or feathers of the characters are so full of details that they look like real animals, The whole casting does an amazing job with the characters, especially Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake, which is without a doubt my favorite part of the movie, the movie tells the story of Rango, a lying hero trying to help the citizens of a small Animal town, the story has breathtaking action scenes.
the movie has countless satisfactory scenes, the way in which the people discover the truth, the way in which Rango is lost in the desert, references to movies, mostly from Clint eastwood, etc., I can't recommend this movie enough, one of the best animated movies I saw",Rango

Very slow start, could have done w/o the opening 20-30min. cute movie and i'm sure if i had kids they would enjoy the movie. a couple humorous parts but all in all wishing i would have gone to see something else instead. i also figure that it wasn't too interesting for the kids in the theater as they were constantly moving around and leaving for food and snacks. so maybe not so funny for them. seems like all of the ""funny"" scenes were in the previews. but as always, a good lesson for kids. the jokes were both for adults and kids, there were times when only the adults would laugh and then you would hear the kids kinda laugh b/c the adults were but you could tell they didn't know why they were laughing.

323,crazzzik,Rather flat than fun,4,5 March 2011,"After seeing a wonderful job by Disney in the from of ""Tangled"", me and my gf decided to go for another animation movie. Highly advertised cartoon with Johny Depp as a main hero voice served a good bait to pick this movie.The movie was flat, non-original and beat up. If you were not a fan of third part of Pirates of Caribbean opening scene, skip this one. The main character seemed to be highly undeveloped. Humor was OK, but not worthy watching. Battle scenes were stunning, but that also did not pull it out. Even Johny's voice acting proved that it is better to see him rather than just hear. I've heard far better voices that would suite this role far better.Finally, about 20 minutes before the end of the movie, quite a few people stood up from their seats and one of them even said ""I don't know how much you need to smoke to sit through this thing"".Bottom line: If you are looking for a good animation and haven't seen tangled, I suggest you getting it on DVD and staying home tonight.",Rango
324,wenkai31,Whoops a daisy.....,9,20 March 2011,"This is a highly anticipated movie to watch for me, and oh boy did it excite me when I got the tickets. There are a couple of parts which really deserve the ratings, but there is also a 'flaw' that made it deserved 9 instead on 10.Firstly, I love the way the directors decided to insert in the 4 birds that sings music everything a significant event has happened to Rango and his friends. The music are Spanish styled, so it kinds of give us a Spanish ambient mixing with action. Although the birds are sadistic in a sense, that is where the majority of laughter comes from.Secondly, I love the 'creepy' part of the movie. Ever watched The International? There is a part at the end where the assassin said thanks to the male character right? If you were a kid, you won't understand a single thing from the ending. However, Rango adapted some inspiration from it, so it kinds of give people a 'professional' scene from a comedy action movie.Thirdly, I love how the director made it seemed that the movie is going to have an unexpected end at the 'professional' parts. There are 2 parts which seemed like it is going to end off abruptly, but it keeps continuing on. Why did I think it's going to end abruptly? The music. Every time a 'professional' scene is going to end, there's this ending music that you will always hear when a hero saved a heroine and they started to kiss and the movie ended with a zoom out and a fade to black screen. Secondly, the tone. Rango seems serious when he looks serious after consulting his 2 friends. Made it look like the director gonna leave you to think of the ending yourself.Finally, this is the part where Rango loses out the 1 point. So close yet so far! The movie ended very abruptly. VERY. The director chose to tell people the story instead of leaving them to think about the ending. If there wasn't this part where the birds tell another lizard joke, I would have given a 8. What is the ending like and what is the joke? Go see the movie yourself.",Rango
325,gallaghergirl09,"Giving a two is being generous.... Odd, and the comedy was the only good thing about it",2,4 March 2011,"This movie, to say the least, is the strangest thing I have ever seen. I went to see this movie, expecting a cute, fun, kid movie. I was sadly disappointed.There are no fun kid aspects of this movie besides the comedy. The content is at times a little... well, not exactly ""vulgar"" but at the same time not kid-friendly. There are uses of the d-word and the h-word, and scary face offs at times. There was drinking, and smoking.At times I could not figure out WHAT IN THE WORLD was going on. I think that some parts were too western for me and just turned odd. I can't describe it in words.There WERE some funny aspects, like the owls, and some occasional jokes. Though, that was as far as the comedy went, really.Take my advice, run to ""The Other Side of the Street"" and AVOID this movie. I did not find it very much entertaining. If Tangled were still in theaters, seeing that would ALMOST make up for the two hours I wasted in Paramount's trash of a movie.",Rango
326,crafter775,I missed the wagon,3,16 August 2011,"This movie was as dry as the desert it was filmed in. Based on the other reviews I obviously missed something here. I even fell asleep it was so slow and dry. Maybe because I don't like regular westerns is why I didn't like Rango. I probably have to watch it again because I just didn't get the whole story line with the turtle (without giving away anything for anyone). Beans accent was a bit over the top, I got tired of listening to her after awhile. Where credit may be do is that the movie made me feel as dry as its desert - it made me feel part of the film (tongue in cheek). Seriously, I suppose credit is do to the animation but a story is much more important to me to enjoy a movie. If the story is no good, like in this case, the animation doesn't even matter. Guess I'm just more of a Rio girl - color, fun",Rango
327,ian-lee17,"Unusual, fun western",8,29 November 2011,"Rango is very fun to watch for fans of Western movies with twists. It reminds me of Kung Fu Panda in re-creating the feel of cult classic Kung Fu movies. The setting and supporting characters feel like a Western though exaggerated for humor, but it makes the characters more appealing and easier to sympathize with. In addition there are fantasy elements of destiny and supernatural phenomena that make it very different from unique and were a really pleasant surprise for me. More generally the plot is predictable, but the pace of the movie feels great. The movie grew on me the more I watched it, with Rango going from an annoying and out of touch with reality to fairly endearing. This movie is also beautiful. The desert scenes were gorgeous and the characters had great detail and expressions.The humor is odd and dry. There are death scenes, so I wouldn't necessarily say this is a good movie for kids. A humorous, weird, comedic but respectful Western that was really fun to watch.",Rango
328,bnawrocki14,Printing the Legend of Rango,7,25 April 2013,"In the film, we are first introduced to a lone gecko creating a movie scene with the inanimate objects in his cage. He is creating a storyline where after being faced with exciting events, he is the hero. As the props give out, Rango is crestfallen as he realizes the mundane and anticlimactic world in which he lives. Then, all of a sudden, the car has to swerve, and Rango's tank flies from the car. Miraculously, Rango finds himself alive on the side of the highway in the desert looking at his shattered home and watching his owner drive away. Alone and faced with the threat of dehydration, starvation, and other dangers, Rango befriends an armadillo. Eventually, Rango finds a town that is faced with a diminishing water supply, a terrorizing hawk, a corrupt mayor, and other unsavory characters. After being appointed sheriff, Rango is given the opportunity to live out the exciting life he had always dreamed for himself. Or so it appears While Rango may appear to just be another children's film about an eccentric pet who has lost his way, it really does encompass all of the themes found in a typical western film. Most notably, Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp)depicts the concept of ""printing the legend."" As in the classic ""TheMan Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" sometimes the story that transpires is actually much different from the reality of the events. For instance,in one scene of the film, it appears that Rango kills a hawk who was bullying and terrorizing the town. Much like with Ranse Stoddard in""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" Rango was credited with taking care of the town's enemy. Throughout the remainder of Rango's time as sheriff , there are other achievements that he is credited for. Despite the actual circumstances surround the events, the legend was printed. One of the many reasons printing the legend has become a prevalent and well accepted practice in our society is because it gives hope to the society at large that they too can become a hero, just like Rango.",Rango

There are no consistent physical laws or rules in this universe. It exists solely as a vehicle for it's loquacious script, good humor, and strange social and political commentary.With religious themes, dark gross out humor and some over the top adult dialog, this may not be the best choice for younger viewers.

334,calvinjedediah,Most Underrated Movie,10,25 August 2021,"This movie is the most underrated movie I have ever seen. There is no better movie more forgotten. There is no masterpiece more underappreciated. I believe many people have watched and enjoyed this movie without actually realizing how beautiful it is, and that many more have never heard of it.Rango is a movie about identity. A movie about a chameleon who can not blend in. A goofy stranger that makes up lies about his past and prestige to hide that he has no past at all, and watches as his lies build him a cage of newfound responsibility and people who are relying on him.""Rango"" looks like a kids movie to those who aren't paying too close attention, but the movie extends beyond what a kid will understand, with extended dream sequences and commentary on corruption, the distribution of recourses, the progress of civilization, and what makes us who we are, whether it be our past accomplishments, our future goals, or how we act in the present.The humor is extraordinarily well done, and the action is well designed and very fun. There are some brilliant Chekhov's Guns that fire, the overall plot structure is perfect, and the mystery is executed strongly. The action is surprisingly good, especially the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" bit. The visuals are breathtaking, and the music, when it is not being used for comedic purposes, is equally breathtaking. The scenes with abstract sequences and spiritual undertones are by far what make me feel this movie is better than its given credit for, and its animation style and character designs are unique and detailed.This movie contains the best scene I have ever watched. I re-watch it whenever I can, and I listen to the music from that scene whenever I can. I have never seen a more elegant abyss and rebirth in a classic heroes journey. Rango's crossing to the other side and becoming a true hero is inspiring and spiritual and transcendent. I genuinely don't know why it isn't more praised.This movie is silly for a lot of its runtime, but its emotional beats shine like bright stars. Its humor never fails me. I never grow bored re-watching it.Please, please watch this movie. And if you've already seen it and didn't see what I see, I urge you to watch it again, and this time, see if you can find it.",Rango

The first 1/2 to 2/3rds of the movie was good, then it went wacko. There were a lot of other movie references, none of which any kids would get. That's OK, it reminded me of the old Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons with the same 'over the kids heads' jokes.The animation was good, and the storyline was alright for a while. But when Rango leaves town in disgrace, it all goes to hell. He encounters the Spirit of the West, in the guise of an old Clint Eastwood with Oscar statuettes in the back of his golf cart, using a metal detector in the middle of the desert. Problem #1 - WTF? Problem #2 - SACRILEGE! The mayor is obviously going to be the bad guy, but somehow Rango sees a vision of the future - Las Vegas is using up all of the water. But wait, it's not really the future, because Rango was dropped out of a terrarium from the back of a car in present day! So why is the town like the old west anyway? Did I miss a time warp when I left to take my daughter to the bathroom for two minutes? The whole is it the future, present, or past thing just doesn't work, especially in a movie marketed towards children. My kids didn't understand any of that. Luckily it went so far over their heads that they didn't bother asking about it.At least it had the typical happy ending, and my kids liked it OK.

About half way through, we realized that most of this humor had been shown to us in the preview we had seen of the movie a few weeks prior. This movie was really hyped a lot so maybe we just had higher than normal expectations. It just didn't live up. Although I did like the animation a lot and the characters were pretty great- sometimes it was just so slow! Basically, my husband and I were bored a lot of the time.

First off, the animation in this movie is spectacular; everything from the animals to the settings to even the inanimate objects were so heavily detailed and realistic and there were so many times that i couldn't even tell it was animated. Let's talk about performances. Johnny Depp was perfect for the role of Rango. He was insanely funny and was such a likable character, and the casting of Johnny Depp for him was right. Bill Nighy was perfect for Rattlesnake Jake, this absolute badass of villain. He looked badass, he sounded badass, he was a full-on badass. Isla Fisher as Beans was excellent; she knows how to do a convincing southern accent and it sounded great. Everyone else (Ray Winstone, Ned Beatty, etc) did an excellent job portraying their characters and portraying them well. Also, all the action sequences were amazing. The fight over getting the water jug was entertaining and hilarious, as well as the scene with Jake shooting down all the bats; it looked awesome. Also, Hans Zimmer never ceases to amaze me with his score. He did amazing with Pirates of the Caribbean and the Dark Knight Trilogy, and he doesn't fail to amaze with the score with this movie. I also really love the banter between all the characters (especially Rango and Jake), and how they constantly interacted and how that would change throughout the film. There's nothing for me to criticize with this movie. I am for sure giving Rango an ""A+"". If you've never seen this movie or have never thought about seeing it, please do.

The characters seem a bit half-assed in their development, and the humor isn't clever enough for grown-ups (yes, there's a Clint Eastwood cameo, but it's not funny).And what's with the cursing in a kids' animated movie? Really seems like they weren't sure of their target audience here. I found this thing to be utterly without charm. I realize a lot of people aren't going to agree with me about this, but that's fine.

I hope that this movie doesn't get forgotten through the year. I wouldn't recommend it to children under the age of 6, but every one above is welcomed! The Good: The cinematography is just beautiful. A dark western just reeks out of the movie screen. The sunsets, the ideas of deceit from a controlling power is an interesting topic for an animated feature. The academy awards this movie deserves best animated feature, cinematography, art direction, sound original score, (TOO MANY HIGH HOPES, BUT THAT'S JUST HOW GOOD THIS MOVE IS.), and probably best picture.The Bad: The Cliché's. The western cliché's are outrageous, and well, nicely presented. The shoot outs, the clothing, Clint Eastwood (Oh yeah, Timothy Olyphant plays a great Eastwood.) There aren't any bad things in this movie I can think of other than the cliché's and the length. I wish the story was longer.The Ugly: The animals in this movie are not the most adorable little things like in most animated movies. They have crooked necks sharp fangs, old wrinkles and ugly faces. Very strange for an animated feature but that abnormality of it makes this movie special. The way the characters behave, there explicit innuendos are not appropriate for a kids movie.

Typical gross effects for the folks who find that amusing were scattered throughout and the asides that could have had substance, had only pandering ""cleverness"". My suppositions, mostly because Johnny Depp was the ""star"", were trashed. I suppose some would find merit in the creation of the characters - would that there had been something to like.

The lesson I learned from this was that you should believe in who you are even when you don't know who you are yet... Confusing, right? This movie is about a lizard actor named Rango. After his cage falls out the back window of his owners' car (who in the world opens their back car window while driving?), Rango walks into a desert where he meets a female lizard named Beans *Rango's love interest*. After riding Rango into town, chaos unfolds as he attempts to help get back the town of Dirt's water supply. Signs of the person who knows where water is point to the town's mayor who, kind of, gives away that he knows where all the water is.Every now and then, there would be a joke or two said but nothing too hilarious to keep up a streak. Being that kid movies (especially animated kid movies) usually appeal to kids, this movie didn't really capture the hearts of the young movie-goers at the screening I went to. A few children actually said they were scared when Rattlesnake Jake started choking Beans with the end of his metal tail.I didn't really like this movie, to tell you the truth.

Gore Verbinski master of his craft, and even with the cartoons he has not worked, but it has not affected the quality of the ""Rango"". Hollywood entrusted him with the ""Pirates""and now - 135 million for the cartoon! Screenwriters worked perfectly. John Logan has worked with cartoons, and his track record there are some seriously paintings such as ""Gladiator"" and ""The Aviator."" It is unknown who is James Ward, Tags, but once he is in the list screenwriters, it means that he put his hand to writing the script.

Yes, and cartoons in the genre of ""western"" almost there. I can only select ""Spirit"". The musical accompaniment also a very good level. But what can I say... Hans Zimmer was a composer of movie ""Inception""! It says a lot. Still want to thank the artists. Perfectly traced parts of the desert, animals, nice to look at all this, the eye rejoices. The artists of ""The Nutcracker"" need a lot of learning from the artists ""Rango."" After all this, wants to discuss the budget. He is great, but in this cartoon involving several great men, who had to pay big money. The budget must be recouped.

It was slow, violent (including showing a child putting a gun in her mouth, and attempted suicide by walking into traffic - obviously NOT things you want your kids to learn) and too many four letter words to count (i.e. ""Sign the damn paper!"" ""Go to Hell!""), sexual innuendo, etc. Not sure who they wrote that movie for, but it wasn't for kids. If you're an adult who happens to enjoy animated movies, go for it, but get a sitter for the kids.",Rango
347,rileyknl,Don't take a child to see,5,19 March 2011,"I was really excited to see Johnny Depp as a lizard, however the first 10 minutes shows that this is not a child's movie. Spoiler ALERT there is an armadillo in the middle of the road that is almost cut in half with tire marks through it. Towards the end of the movie we are introduced to a snake that says it's from hell and going there doesn't seem like a bad idea. Also, Spoiler ALERT Rango tries to commit suicide by walking across a busy highway, this is not a good message to send to kids. I give it a 5 just because Johnny Depp was in it, his character was a good one, except for trying to commit suicide. Just as a warning, if your a parent you should watch it before you take any kids to see it.",Rango
348,neilucifer,Real good fun,10,21 March 2011,"This movie is insane! I read a lot of negative reviews here, and all of them had one common factor: children. Of course it's not meant for your 4 year old kid, It's a Gore Verbinski movie. This guy made The Ring and Pirates of Caribbean, none of them had any child-safe approach about them. if you want to make your children happy, go and watch Mars need Mom or something.Ranting aside, this movie is one hell of fun journey and a feast for eyes. No 3d, shining bright colors, A good script that gives space to each and every character, strange and beautiful landscapes; the list is quite endless. It also happens to be quite post modern in it's approach. I couldn't believe what I was watching on screen. You definitely will long for a second watch.in movie Things were not shiny and tidy. It was full of grime, the characters experienced real helplessness and despair; you could feel for them. That's a big achievement for an animation movie.",Rango
349,tom_mcwest,exceptional animated insanity,10,23 March 2011,"Movie reviewer Roger Moore panned ""Rango"" in the Saturday March 5th Atlanta Journal Constitution. I had seen the trailer and was impressed with the spot on animation and characters, so I went anyway. I'm glad I ignored Moore's negativity. He seemed to stew in his own juices over the fact that the movie is not necessarily geared toward children. And it's not geared toward children. Who said it had to be just because it's animated? Dare I say that Rango is a great animated movie. As I said the animation is perfect. The characters are in turn cute, precious, nasty and down right ugly. I marveled at how an animator can evoke so much emotion in a computer created character with a voice. It is amazing. I must add that I did not take a small child to this movie, I'm 63, and I would not advise that others do. While some of the characters are cute and cuddly, some scenes are scary. But that's why it's rated PG. In addition the movie is funny, makes an environmental point, is at times poignant, sad, gross and hokey. And if you don't like Jonny Depp, who is the voice of Rango, don't worry you don't have to look at him and he does a credible job as a lizard. I recommend it highly.",Rango
350,wouter-de-groot,It was surprisingly...just surprisingly,8,24 March 2011,"Almost accidentally I ended up in front of the big screen to see this movie. At first I wasn't very happy with this 'accident', thinking that I must have seen enough animated movies by now! I mean, yes they're all very nice with funny characters and nice graphics and all, but come on! How many of these movies can a man take?!Turns out: at least one more! It was surprisingly...just surprisingly! Normally I find myself having a hard time laughing during these movies, due to the somewhat childish way it is presented. With Rango it was different! This movie just worked for me. Somehow the humor in it was not ""too much"" (for example like the donkey in Shrek, that's to much for me) and well timed! Even though the storyline is pretty predictable, the way the storyline is presented is new(ish). Besides I love the whole western thing that's going on in this movie! And of course -and this is predictable as well- the role Johnny Depp plays is one off a kind and makes the movie!",Rango
351,g-e-newkirk,Definitely worth seeing,8,21 May 2011,"This animation is a great way to introduce children to the classic western theme. The characters are interesting and the plot is strong. The viewer gets a sense of how dry and desolate the west can be along with the harsh struggle for existence. Depp was a perfect choice for the main character, but the Clint Eastwood character could have looked a little more authentic. The film also lacks the kind of polish that could have made it a truly great Western. The moral theme is clear and solid, but the film lacks sufficient poignancy to become a classic. Still, it is a great family movie.I plan to purchase the DVD and put it with my Westerns collection. I look forward to watching it many times with the grandchildren.",Rango

This movie is not an average kids movie. It featured foul language and inappropriate jokes. There was also some things that kids might find disturbing, such as scary looking creatures, creatures getting killed, and terms like ""I'll squeeze those brown eyes out of your skull"" and ""...your guts leak lead"" or something like that. In fact, it slightly disturbed me. I thought it would be good, considering that it looked cute and Rango was voiced by Johnny Depp. I'm disappointed. Not only that, but the storyline seems to falter.

We should have walked out after the first 45 minutes but I kept hoping it would get better. Interesting that this movie actually uses religious symbols to mock Christianity. The turtle holds up a cross while the towns people chant ""Hallelujah"" and refer to water as ""our salvation"" over and over again through out the movie. In one instance the characters are in jail and the water busts through the roof in the climax one character says ""What's that?"" and instead of saying something like 'that's our ticket outa here' he says ""It's our salvation"".

It made me laugh, it made me sad, it was visually stunning, and the story was refreshingly new. However, this film was advertised as a movie for children. I just want to give a heads up to parents considering taking their young children to see this movie that it is verbally offensive at parts, and the story line is one that you probably don't want your children to comprehend. A lot of the dialogue centers around who is going to be murdering whom, and sending them to hell. There is also a lot of shooting, so if this is something you'd like to spare your children from, be warned. I'd say a 10-13 year old range would be an acceptable starting audience. But at the end of the day, this movie is more for the older crowd. Otherwise, ENJOY! It will make you laugh.",Rango
367,mark-s-adams,Like a Cadillac with no fuel,4,5 March 2011,"Just got back from seeing Rango with my wife. They couldn't seem to make up their mind who they were making a movie for.I expected it was primarily geared toward children, but there was a fair amount of profanity and innuendo. I felt uncomfortable for a lot of the people there with their young children. Really not a movie for young kids.Rango's character experienced some personal development, but overall, I just didn't think the characters or the plot had enough depth to keep an adult interested.Without giving too much away, it is basically a spaghetti western type story. I think the intent is for it to be about Rango developing as an individual, but it mostly feels like it's about everyone being thirsty. (With the price of concessions these days, it presented me withquite a dilemma...if you see it, be sure to bring a giant drink with you.) I will say, the visuals are absolutely incredible. Some of the action scenes are really well done. All the close-ups of the characters are impressive. The voicing is well done, and there are several humorous moments that were enjoyable.Overall, it's beautiful, but it moves along too slow. I didn't feel like it had enough substance to keep me interested. It's kind of like having a shiny new Cadillac, but no fuel. Beautiful to look at, and an terrific cast, but in the end, I was just couldn't find enough to care about to stay interested. I love most of the actors involved, and really wanted to like it, but just didn't. I hope you enjoy it more than I did.",Rango
368,christy-crisis,Just extraordinary!,10,4 March 2011,"Rango has pleased me in such a way that I am unsure any other movie ever has and I was just raving to myself about it from the beginning, so I just HAD to share! This movie was a beautifully inclusive of things I didn't even know I appreciated in a movie because I had simply never seen such care put into its production. I am so relieved that there are still people who are dedicated to making the best movie they possibly can and I dare to hope that Rango sets the bar for the movies to follow in 2011. Right away I noticed the immense detail in the animation and the focus on simple, graceful images, qualities that did not disappear as the movie progressed. The plot and the protagonist's journey are both traditional and yet unique and fresh, thanks to the not-so-cliché detailed additions and unexpected perspective. The imagery is simply phenomenal and so gracefully blunt. I would not really consider this a children's movie because there isn't any dancing around the frightening or violent, it is all very inclusive. Another thing that surprised me was the overall wordiness and the style of humor. Some of the jokes I didn't get immediately, so I definitely liked the intellectual humor there. Once again, I don't really think that children are a fitting audience for such humor and there were definitely bewildered children in the theatre wondering why all the adults were laughing. I like that the story seems very folk-y when viewed out-of-context, but is brought into perspective very well. The characters were all very individual and dimensional. One thing that was refreshing was the variety in settings and genre. We go from Rango's little 'theatre' and his artsy dramatics to a Tex-Mex kind of environment where we are occasionally and subtly reminded that this is a role of Rango's and that we are in the modern era. I thought that Rango's graceful success and general boldness upon first arriving in Dirt were off-beat and quite pleasingly surprising. The music also fit very well with the film but wasn't simply background music, so I was surprised again that the movie makers would bother so much. There were a lot of subtle techniques used, and maybe it's just my own artistic eye, but these (things like Rattlesnake Jake nearly never being shown fully in frame, which makes him seem very large and thus quite frightening) show me that this was a film crafted with the utmost care. I can't find anything bad to say about this film, which proves to me that the people responsible for this went above and beyond, trying to make each aspect of the film a masterpiece in itself for an overall very consistently lovely movie. I would definitely recommend that everyone see it.",Rango

I am fortunate they are naive enough to not catch a lot of the things other kids/adults were catching in this movie. They did notice the loud, violent scenes, and the swearing. I heard many gasps during inappropriate parts, and wondered what I was doing there with my children at some points. There is language (damn, hell). There is major violence (guns, a suicide attempt, a hanging, a lot of fighting). Adult innuendo that isn't so subtle, kids aren't as dumb as we think. I watched many parents walk out with their kids. I heard a lot of crying/scared kids who eventually ended up leaving . Christians will be offended at the sac-religious remarks (hallelujah to the water, the Holy ""Spigot"").

370,TheProudPeanut,"There's two kinds of movies in this world my friend... the ones who work, and the ones who could have worked better.",8,4 March 2011,"Heads up, I gave this movie a 8/10, so that you don't think I found it a mediocre film... because it ain't!I saw Rango yesterday night at a half filled (or half empty) room. There was 1 single kid watching it and she stopped talking the minute the 4 mariachis showed up on screen, so I guess it's not the worst movie for kids. Part of her attention, of course, wasn't for the story, or the jokes or for the inumerous references to the genre classics, it was for the visuals. Colourful, highly-detailed, realistic and abstract sometimes, but always with a little of cartoonish look to it. That part, I most say, also caught a lot of my attention, I was utterly amazed with the landscape, the details of the objects and the composition of every thing on screen from start to finish.As for the story, I must say I find it genius and creative the way they manage to create this parody of western American and spaghetti movies in a animalistic context. The characters, from Rango itself to that bird with the thinguie in the eye, where greatly conceived, but didn't had the best lines to give them memorable moments and that's exactly what goes wrong with the movie for me. Everything was there to make excellent jokes and by doing so and adding it to the great story behind the town of Dirt, the movie would be unforgettable. The comic reliefs where most of the time forced and some of the comic moments looked like Peter Griffin gave Rango some humour lessons. All in all, the movie is a most see for me, the western genre fans will love (or hate) to spot the references and some will put a nostalgic smile on your face. The visuals again were a spot on for me, the mood of the film's fantastic, the creativity involved in the characters is great (you'll love Cascavel Jake), and the story's memorable and new, but the ingredient that keeps this plate from being a classic is the script, and by this I mean most of the jokes and lines.",Rango

We follow around a chameleon who is trying to ""blend in with the town"" (didn't see that coming), and everyone in the town was the least bit interesting. There were even characters that had what seemed at first to be necessary parts, but you later learn that they have no purpose what so ever. We could have watched the movie just as fine without them.

The technology gets better and more impressive with every film.I wanted to like this movie. I took my 12 year old son and 10 year old daughter. I was embarrassed and uncomfortable that I chose this movie. I cannot believe how blatantly sexist this film was. The main character has a ""friend"" that is a headless/topless Barbie doll. I realize that a Barbie doll is a doll but the writers make it sexual when they have Rango put his arm around it and ask if the breasts are fake or real. Breasts are prominent through-out the movie. There is a character (I think a frog) that has large breasts heaving out of her dress. This character adds nothing to the story line. It is very odd to have gratuitous sexuality in a family film. Early on a character offers his sister in exchange for safety. There are numerous inappropriate jokes. They ask if he ""misses his mother's mangoes?"" Without telling the story there is another ""adult"" joke that says that she just swallowed ""Plan B."" There are cuss words that do not add any value to the storyline. I truly wish that writers would consider their audience will include impressionable children. Rango lies to everyone about being a tough guy. The spirit if the west said you ""started it now you must finish it."" It is not very clear what message they want us to walk away with.

Yes, it was slightly long winded at parts and yes, the humor was a little too dry occasionally but neither of these prevented us from enjoying the movie overall. The attention to details in the animation was amazing and visually speaking the movie was quite enjoyable.To all the parents complaining about the language and content, I question your ability to actually research a movie before bringing your children to see it. You seem to be too lazy to look up a movie beforehand and see why its rated PG and in this case its rated PG for rude humor, language, action and smoking. Seeing as how most of the complaints of the content fall into these topics, there is no one to blame here but you, the parent. People these days seem to have forgotten that PG stand for 'Parental Guidance suggested' meaning you the parent, have to make a judgment call of if the movie is right for your kids. I quote a Wiki article: ""PG - Parental Guidance Suggested - Some material may not be suitable for children under 10. These films may contain milder swear words, brief smoking, crude/suggestive humor, natural non-sexual nudity, short and infrequent horror moments and/or mild violence."" Hmmm...most if not all of those were present in this movie, yet most of you parents are complaining about them, even though you knew the movie was rated PG. Stop blaming movies, and start paying attention to movie ratings. If its PG or above, research the movie ahead of time, before taking the family. If you don't agree with its content, don't go. IMDb even has a wonderful 'Parents Guide' for you to reference: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1192628/parentalguide",Rango
386,cmcguire1988,DO NOT TAKE YOUNG CHILDREN!! More Family Guy and less Shrek!,3,10 March 2011,"We went and saw Rango tonight. It started out OK but quickly turned into something I would never take children to. There were two sets of parents with five children, between them, under the age of six, they all left mid movie because of the guns and language. It has minor cuss words(hell,damn...almost b**ch but they turned it into a bird squawk...""you son of a b""squawk!!"".) There are tons of guns, general violence, alcohol, and creepy cactus creatures. Some of the characters are gruesome themselves, such as a bird with an arrow through its head and some cross dressing by the main character. More Family Guy and less Shrek. Awful!",Rango
387,fadikh,Not Funny,4,11 March 2011,"I read a lot of good reviews about this movie and i went with high expectations, but i got out from the theater disappointed.I'm no a movie critic, i'm just someone who wants to enjoy a movie. Rango, being an animated movie and with the picture showing him with one eye ball bigger than the other, gives the impression of being a funny movie. The jokes in Rango do not make the adult audience laugh, most of them are targeted for children, but ironically, this movie is not for children either, because the story is too complicated for them.It is true that the animations are great, but we have seen this before. Great animation would be enough to make a movie if it is some new technique or technology like avatar or toy story.In Summary, kids will not understand this movie. Adults will not find it entertaining.",Rango
388,jacob-999-638858,"An original, and highly entertaining animation.",8,12 March 2011,"This movie is great. to be specific, the best part are the psychedelic visuals, the AWESOME character aethstetics, and the clarity of of visuals. The story is good, but is essentially a homage to classic Westerns, particularly the movie Django, but it is not your typical kids movie. In fact half of the references are pointed towards things adults would only know (according to my mum) and the plot is actually surprising in some ways. As a western fan, and Clint Eastwood fan, the movie provides great nostalgia to the man with no name. For me this is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. Sure it is no Toy Story 3, or an animation full of emotion, and gravitas, but it definitely provides great animation, STUNNING visuals, great morales, amazing character design, and great western film nostalgia. Go and see this film and enjoy it. I might actually see it again.",Rango
389,leescottdavis,Frankly dull,4,12 March 2011,"The animation is excellent in this film, but frankly it's pretty dull. You never really bond with Rango from the outset. He's not endearing at all. The story had potential and maybe if they'd made this more comical it could have met it's potential. Why they felt the need to get a big name star to provide the voice for Rango I do not know. Johnny adds nothing to Rango at all. My wife and I drew comparison to Toy Story and Shrek where Myers and Hanks added to the character. I doubt Depp was really interested.I was close to leaving half way through the film, but with such good reviews I thought it must surely get better. It doesn't. Wait for the DVD if your kids want to watch it.",Rango
390,casnera,not for young children!,2,14 March 2011,"As a cartoon, drawing children of course, I was shocked! Mild language, guns to heads A lot! I am a movie lover, and I couldn't believe I wanted to sleep. Very,very disappointed for a movie my whole family was looking forward to. A waste of money, especially with the prices of movies (plus concessions!) Totally disappointed! Keep young kids home!!!! Looking around in theater , there were a lot of adults, which I can see, b/c the movie wasn't for young kids, the guns(which i know it's based on western) were constantly being drawn and pointed at heads. The movie also was soooo slow moving. Again surprised...Johnny Depp!!! Thought for sure i'd love it! My 9 & 12 yr old were asking how much longer do you think? Felt bad, especially $35 spent for three of us...Bummer! :(",Rango
391,surjeet-s-malik,Animation good with very weak storyline.,4,16 April 2011,"Animation was good for this movie but where is the story. One can see the trailer and those were all the good scenes in the movie. Thats it. Trailer gives you impression that movie is awesome. I was looking forward for this movie since a long time. Disappointed with the movie overall. No need to go to theater and spend money, its not worth. Voice of Jonny Depp was nice to hear at some places. In end the movie became very dull and boring. You can get a good sleep if you are not crazy about animation. If I compare it with HOP then definitely HOP will win on all grounds. I will give it 4 rating as I don't like it inspite of being a fan of animated movies.",Rango
392,themagdas,Simply Awful,1,19 March 2011,"Unfortunately, we were so disappointed in Rango. The trailers looked great, but were the only decent parts of the movie. Actually, when they were shown in context to the entire film, weren't that funny either.We were surprised at the darkness of the movie, the violence, the horrible story line and the pathetic script. Most of the dialog was convoluted, contrived and complicated.The kids are the best indicator of how good the movie was. Most of the kids in the theater were scared, bored or sad during most of the film. There was a little girl in the theater with her grandparents who were holding their hands over her eyes during the violent parts.We give it an F!",Rango
393,bunetz,Very cool movie,1,27 March 2011,"The voice talent, however, is superb in every aspect. Johnny Depp showcases his range and delivers a performance that's just nerdy and vulnerable enough to speak to everyone watching, while having strong enough character to keep audiences rooting for him. The rest of the cast is brimming with celebrity voices and everyone turns in wonderful performances aided with pitch-perfect animation. Isla Fisher and Bill Nighy (as Rattlesnake Jake) transform their voices so much that they're barely recognizable. Other notable voices are Alfred Molina, Abigail Breslin and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone pulls more than their weight and truly makes the most of their respective scenes.The target audience will no doubt love Rango, but the film doesn't quite tap into a universal emotion that bridges all age groups. While the film does give older audiences a few treats, like adult jokes, a Clint Eastwood reference and a political message that marries currency with mindless religion, this film is mainly for the kids and they will simply have a good time.",Rango
394,midieklate,The Must See Movie for Every Family,8,22 March 2011,"I, My wife and my daughter went to see Rango over the weekend because it was the most well-reviewed movie currently in theaters. The first impression I had of this film was two-fold, funny and weird. A lot of the humor, the story, and the concept is completely off the wall and strange. Eventually I realized that this film is basically a love letter to the classic Spaghetti Western. Once I had realized that, the film became much easier to digest for me. We really loving it.The characters were very well developed. One of the most brilliant ways they were able to create a character was with Johnny Depp's voice acting of Rango. The script was good, and he simply made it more so. They were able to create a compelling and interesting character out of a character that, in fact, has no foundation whatsoever. Rango is completely empty, void of any kind of interesting background save for the one he creates for himself. Out of that, they created a character that you love and want to root for. The others characters, who all came complete with actual backgrounds and goals, were equally satisfying. The antagonists were as fun to watch as the protagonists, and Rattlesnake Jake was a stroke of pure genius.The best parts of the film was their handling of the Spirit of the West. Without giving anything away, the Spirit of the West was perfectly and beautifully portrayed. I loved how, using Timothy Olyphant as the voice of the Spirit, they were able to reference the passing of the baton, so to speak, from classic westerns into modern westerns. The face of the Spirit combined with the voice was the perfect homage to the western genre.My Family love films like this and Wall-E, films that slap us in the face and tell us that there is something seriously wrong with modern society, and do so in a way that makes sense. The need for change in our everyday lives is long past due, and I love when our art reflects this.",Rango
395,travl321,OK but kinda disappointing and not so much a kids movie,5,23 March 2011,"i saw this movie and was somewhat disappointed but not completely it was pretty funny but i didn't think the language was. Most of the ""H""'s were referring to the place but but the ""D"" took me by surprise. in my opinion not exactly the best kids movie in the world but it was OK. and OK spoiler alert but i think it was not very cool for the snake to have an MG on his tail but other than all that johnny depp (pardon the spelling if i spelled that wrong) and the rest of the cast was great i saw a thing on TV that showed how they did the animation and thought it was cool so i give them kudos for that i thought it was very innovative and silly to see a bunch of grown men and women dancing around like goofballs and you can probably see what i'm talking about on youtube but yeah all in all its a silly movie that made me laugh at some times and liked it a lot",Rango
396,reagan351,Beautiful Movie!!!,9,2 April 2011,"OK, this movie is one of the few kid's movies I have recently wanted to see. I'm so glad I went. The animation was beautifully done, the voices were great, and the story was entertaining. But, there are a few jokes in the movie other people are complaining about. The thing is, it will go over your child's head, simple as that. Some people have said they walked out, that's ridiculous! If you are a parent, you should have looked into the movie before hand (it is PG) and looked at the parental guide on IMDb. Overall, I would definitely recommend you see this if you are looking for a good western kid's movie!! Plus, it's Johnny Depp, you can't go wrong!",Rango
397,jablesvanburen,Loved it.,9,28 March 2011,"I thought the film was fantastic. The only downside was that it was perhaps a little long in terms of development. It took a while for the final ""hoorah"" to take place, but that didn't bother me much at all. Getting to that point was an exhilarating ride and I enjoyed every moment. The story, while classic, was interesting. The characters were multi-dimensional, and the images were breathtakingly crisp. Depp's voice was a perfect match for Rango. He creates this comical character with his voice, but yet one that the audience feels for in every capacity. We want him to win, and we want him to be happy. I totally recommend that everyone see this movie. As a last point, the graphics are a little creepy so perhaps younger children should be kept at home, but everyone else, make a point to see this movie. - Jables",Rango
398,carolespinho,A comedic western with Johny Depp's voice,5,13 July 2011,"This was the first time I didn't really know what the story was about before watching the film. I enjoyed the plot, is a western and I don't really like westerns, but this one is full of comedy and of course, it has Johny Depp! Johny as always deliver an extraordinary performance, even if its only his voice. Also, Isla Fisher surprised me with her perfect accent. The only thing that I thought that wasn't necessary was the owls that sing and narrate the movie, it kind of ruins some scenes and pulls off your attention from the moment. It is not the best animation ever, but it has a good story and nice characters, it's a good film to watch in movies night.",Rango
399,sonal8711,a movie which is a complete act,10,1 February 2012,"Rango comes as a complete package. While the movie is animation, the characters touch the mature audience with as much ease as a kid's imagination. The protagonist and his quest to realize who he is takes everyone on a riveting journey. Though, the question seems old, the treatment by Gore Verbinski ensures that there isn't a dull moment. The backdrop of the Wild West makes you almost nostalgic of the classic action movies. Rango mixes the character with shades of humor, wit and effortless storytelling. The animation is good but it has yet to come at par with the expressions and finesse of the already established studios. The supporting characters were not that clearly defined but created an interesting ensemble anyway. The background score of the movie, mostly a compilation of Wild West themes, is simply perfect. Many-a-time you'd find yourself anticipating the exact music sequence, if you're a fan of course. The sequences are action packed and entwined with main plot are many secondary layers of a more philosophical and deep sense of understanding. It's the kind of movie that can be watched over and again. A must watch movie for 2011.",Rango
400,lol4444,"Great, but please put on a warning next time, okay?",9,10 July 2011,"My little sister was very excited today as she just got a new movie for her birthday and that's why we've decided to have a family movie night together. I expected another boring badly animated something, But after a first few minutes I realized that this thing is actually worth watching.I've heard a lot of people complaining this movie is not suitable for kids and I agree with them. It's not. But using all this so called bad language didn't really bothered us, not only because English is not our native language and my sis doesn't really understand what they're saying, but also because ''Go to hell!'' or ''Damn!'' aren't really that bad. Kids will most definitely hear much worse things in school or while listening to their parents fighting, so that's not really that much of a problem. They're also to young to understand all the sex jokes and if they do, well, then it shouldn't actually bother you, as they already know too much. As for the killing, death and such, I believe they've seen worse. On local news maybe? What makes this movie not suitable for little children is the story. They just won't understand most of the jokes, references and they won't follow the story in full as it's somehow complicated and not-so-straightforward.On the other hand, this movie is great for a little older audience. Especially all the adults, who have grown up watching all those westerns and have seen them coming into the cinema (and, of course, liked them) will enjoy it. It's full references and jokes connected to pretty much every suitable successful movie out there. Even I was able to find some funny references, although I'm a bit too young to understand every single one.The characters are kind of cute, in their own way, and the chameleon as protagonist - well, that's just awesome. Oh, and I just love the animation. I'm kind of bored watching the same-looking characters all the time. There is some more diversity here and that's what I love the most about it. It's a bit different, but hey, that's what's all about, right? As for the end - this is one of the best movies I've seen so far. The characters, the story, even the background make a perfect combo. The only reason, why I gave it a 9 is the fact that there is no warning that the content is not suitable for younger children. But what the hell, it won't kill them if they see it.",Rango
401,bidiot,Great animation + funny characters + bad scenario = boring movie,4,8 March 2011,"The first half of this movie is OK. There is some action going, animation is nice, wild west rocks, you meet new characters and have high expectations. But, after a while, it all gets 100% predictable and boring. Basically, it transforms into standard: Good Hero fights his complexes to help Other Stupid Cowards and defeat Bad Hero. Children around you start crying, you yawn and fun ends. Well, there is still hope, so you are not leaving the movie room, expecting to have at least some fun. Time passes, you fight your boredom, Good Hero fights his personal problems, still no fun. You continue thinking about leaving, but curiosity wins and you decide to wait until the end in hope that, maybe, the movie will have not an ordinary ending... Nope, hope dies last and I'm glad I will not meet Rango again.",Rango
402,jolve1988,Fabulous western movie,8,28 November 2011,"Rango, who was a domestic lizard and always dreaming to be a hero, one day escaped from the fish tank and settled foot on the adventurous journey. When he arrived at a small frontier town, he killed an eagle by accident, as a result, Rango was honored as the hero and assigned as the sergeant in this town. However, a rattlesnake, who was an evil, challenged Rango. But eventually, Rango beat the rattlesnake with his wisdom and bravery.This is a fabulous cartoon, as well as an awesome western movie, which shows great veneration to American frontier culture. In this movie, Rango once lost in the journey for seeking ""Spirit of West"", however, when he waked up, he found that the ""Spirit of West"" left some words on the glass ""No man can walk out of his own story."" Consequently, what can we do is just chasing for what we want and try our best to do what can we do. This exactly correspond to the ""Can do"" spirit. As a result, it seems to me that this is an inspiring movie.",Rango
403,stekkos,Short note/ Warning,6,11 December 2011,"I would advise reviewing this movie VERY carefully before watching it with a child. Regardless of its looks, is as nasty as any other western, and for a child the animal animations could cause very bad dreams (or other unwanted reactions). Lots of gun fights, chases, and some other scenes i cannot mention without spoiler alert. Also add that most animals are reptiles and amphibians, so they have disturbing looks, especially since they are made to look worse than in real life. Good movie for adult/ teenage crowd though, i think parents would enjoy watching it alone and then decide if they want their children to see it. It is a win/win situation that way. Personally i feel animation movies should not be that dark in mood.",Rango

I enjoyed this movie. It's not as bad as everyone here makes it out to be. I liked the title character and all the rest too. blah blah blah. What is this everyone is saying about swearing? WHAT swearing? Only some American who is a complete prude would think things like ""hell"" and ""damn"" are swear words. ffs! and the only thing more blasphemous than using so- called ""christian words"" is the half-wits who actually think those words are unique to Christianity.

407,jakemorgan-92239,Rango: An Underrated Classic,9,12 October 2016,"The film Rango directed by Gore Verbinski is based around a theatrical chameleon who gets abandoned from his lavish family into a town called Dirt. In an effort to show out for the citizens he proves his worth by displaying his skills with firearms and ends up impressing the town enough to become their sheriff. Little do they know his qualifications are completely made up and his identity is all an act. Throughout the film, Rango is exposed to a myriad of dangers that force him to change his sheriff duties from an act into becoming a true hero. This film uses the superb voice acting of Johnny Depp and Abigail Breslin along with many other popular actors to illustrate the underlying humor of the situation of a group of talking animals running a town. Which also brings up how dynamic and uncommon the plot is, the film shows another side to an otherwise uneventful story by giving the audience a peek into Rango's personal struggles with keeping up his lie, the film is also accompanied by an example of animation that is well above par.The Protagonist, Rango, is an inherently charming and funny character, he uses his expertise in theatre to coerce an entire town into believing he's a competent sheriff. This is made possible by the voice acting of Johnny Depp, an actor known for his humorous demeanor. Depp has been seen in films such as the Pirates of the Caribbean series and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, where he is yet again the comic relief. Rango, when brought into town, is very quickly introduced to a young, naive mouse named Pricilla, voiced by Abigail Breslin. Breslin in most all of her films represents an innocent little girl, such as in Little Miss Sunshine or Zombieland. Making her a perfect fit for the tiny mouse with a ""funny looking face""Many films nowadays have very predictable plots with little variation, Rango however, while having the common characteristics of the overplayed ""newcomer saving the day."" This film elaborates on that and makes the viewer fall in love with this strange little lizard, and makes you hope for his well-being even though the audience knows the whole time that his heroism is all a story. Also being that he is a lizard brings a completely new dynamic into the film, the animation. The animation is very impressive, the characters aren't creepy or disturbing like I commonly see in many animated films lately. The animation also impressed me by incorporating real world objects in an otherwise animated world, such as Rango's best friend, Mr. Timms, who is animated convincingly enough that he almost seems real.All in all, Rango is a very well rounded film. It incorporates good voice acting into a very fitting plot and is completed by superb animation. This film is one of nickelodeons best and makes me tear up every time I have to see Rango walk away from the town after they figure out his true identity. This film is very over looked in my opinion, and many people don't give it enough credit for how elaborate some of the animation is. Overall I can very confidently give this film 9 tumbleweeds out of 10.",Rango
