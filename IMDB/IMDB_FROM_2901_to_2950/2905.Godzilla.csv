0,TheLittleSongbird,"Deeply flawed, but kind of a guilty pleasure",6,10 January 2011,"This movie is far from amazing, but it doesn't entirely deserve the maligning it gets. Is the pace plodding sometimes? Yes it is, especially in the middle act. Is the script weak? Yes it is rather. Is the direction unfocused? I think so, but it is Roland Emmerich, a director I never found particularly good anyway, that said I actually think it is one of his better directing jobs here. Is the acting bad? Sort of and sort of not. Matthew Broderick is very bland, and his character is poor, same with the female lead whose acting style doesn't belong but Harry Shearer is fun and Jean Reno is surprisingly dignified.I did love the idea of Godzilla though. There may be the odd hole here and there, but thanks to a quite riveting final half hour especially it remains interesting. The scenery is splendid, the editing is good enough, some sequences are entertaining and Godzilla while different is very well designed. The score is also memorable. And while there are flaws to Godzilla, I couldn't help being entertained. This film isn't Emmerich's best, but contrary to what others might say I don't think it is his worst either. Overall, it has a lot of problems, but I kind of liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Godzilla
1,Leofwine_draca,Worst giant monster film ever,1,22 July 2016,"You know, I used to think that there couldn't be a bad monster movie. However low the production costs of a film, however cheesy the acting, the sight of a monster eating or killing people would always make a film great fun to watch. Of course, I felt like this back in the days before I saw abominations such as WES CRAVEN'S MIND RIPPER or METAMORPHOSIS. But I never thought that I'd be sitting in a cinema watching a multi-million pound monster movie which was utterly dire. And sad to say, GODZILLA wins the award for worst monster movie ever.I'm not talking about worst in terms of cheap special effects (hell, I love those films), there is no status attached to this film when I say that. It's just bad, and difficult to watch. I felt quite embarrassed that I was in the cinema while this played. My friend walked out halfway through and that's saying something. The worst thing was that it was summer, the hype for this film had been played up a lot and I was really looking forward to it. The trailer looked excellent. Although word on the 'net had been bad, I thought ""How bad can it be? it's got a big monster in it!"" Now I can look back and shake my head and think how wrong I was.The film reeks of two things: commercialism (witness the numerous references to Disney and the like) and, unfortunately, Americanism. Godzilla was created due to French nuclear testing - excuse me? The film is full of bland American jingoistic losers who walk around and smile and think they're the best. The worst offender is ""pretty boy"" Matthew Broderick, child star of the 1980s, who appears to think he's the best thing since sliced bread. The female lead is also bubble-headed and atrocious, no wonder blondes get a bad name. The only competent actor is Jean Reno, French star of LEON, who gives a tongue in cheek performance. We know he's not really taking this film seriously and he stands head and shoulders amid his co-stars, acting all of them off the screen at once (including Godzilla herself).As for Godzilla, there's no man in a suit this time. Instead we get state of the art computer effects which look truly horrendous. I don't want to watch a video game, I want to watch a film! Sadly, the special effects are pretty much ripped off JURASSIC PARK, so any surprise or awe we may have had when that film opened in 1993 has completely gone now, especially with so many CGI-fests filling our cinema screens. There is exactly one good scene in the film, where the heroes are stalked by lots of velociraptor-like monsters in a train station, which is effective and enjoyable to watch, but seeing as this is ripped off JURASSIC PARK too there's not a lot to commend.All in all, this atrocious rubbish proves once and for all that Godzilla should be left to the Japanese. There are no rubber-suited maniacs, no incredibly bad dubbin,g and most of all no rubber dummies falling out of windows here. If you're looking for monster movies go elsewhere; this film is an abomination and typical of the trash filling the cinemas these days. All special effects, no plot, acting or anything else. What a bomb.",Godzilla
2,SnoopyStyle,Big Lizard action pretty good but double climax destroyed the ending,6,7 October 2013,"Director Roland Emmerich brings us the legendary lizard. Godzilla rises from a South Pacific atomic bomb test, walks across Panama, and attacks New York City.Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is studying worms after Chernobyl disaster. Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) is his college sweetheart and lowly assistant at a TV station. Hank Azaria is the cameraman, and Jean Reno is French secret service. Together they battle the big lizard and a whole lot of less-big lizards.First off the location is too ridiculous. Godzilla start from the South Pacific and cross oceans just to go to NY. I didn't know he had relatives there.The action is pretty good. It's definitely Godzilla size. But a lot of little things are annoying like the miniature building background. I don't think they could make them any faker than when the helicopters were chasing Godzilla.Most importantly, they did a double climax. Basically they killed all the lizards in Madison Square Gardens. That's the climax. They need to wrap things up and send everybody home. Instead they resurrect Godzilla to tack on another 30 minutes of action where they have to kill him again. It destroyed the tension and that's so important in an action movie. That 30 minutes at the end is completely self-defeating.",Godzilla
3,Hitchcoc,"So Many Special Effects, So Little Story",5,3 April 2006,"I wanted to like this. I was told by one of my students that a big buck remake of Godzilla was coming out. Then, like happens too often, the big bucks were spent on eye candy and not on a really engaging film. While the lizard was certainly amazing, the way he jumps around and squashes things is almost too formidable. Had he been bent on total destruction there would have been a total annihilation of New York in a few minutes. Of course, his motivations lie elsewhere. He certainly is better than a guy in a Godzilla suit, but eventually get to the humans. I'm not quite sure what to think of Matthew Broderick. He is one of the most bland people I have every seen. Even on Letterman he comes off as the dull guy next door. He also still looks like he's about sixteen. Instead of building really great suspense and waiting for the lizard to make its movie, we have these scientific ramblings. There is humor injected here and there. The newspaper people are ridiculous. The French guys are so out of place that all they do is confuse everyone. Just because you are French, doesn't mean you are stupid. It is a Western country and the people know what's going on in the world. French Roast coffee, indeed! A lame excuse for an on screen commercial. I tried watching this again and was befallen with the same basic endless boredom. The special effects are nonpareil, but after a while they only get you to first base.",Godzilla
4,classicsoncall,"""That's a lot of fish"".",8,13 March 2016,"I thought the movie was OK when it first came out and thought the same after watching it again a little while ago. Funny how you can't please some folks; the picture took it's fair share of hits by the fan-boys who slammed it for one reason or another back in the day. As a dinosaur loving kid growing up in the Fifties I got hooked on these flicks with the original 1954 ""Godzilla"", or ""Gojira"" if you will going with the Japanese translation.Watching today however brings an entirely new perspective to the story. The first view one has of the Manhattan skyline with a clear image of the Twin Towers only three years before it was brought down by terrorists got a sobering response from this viewer. The destruction wrought by the monster on the streets of New York was in it's own way oddly prescient of the calamity brought to bear on the city on 9/11. One of the characters even references the 1993 World Trade Center bombing to bring that arc full circle.I recall thinking at the time of the movie's release that Matthew Broderick was the wrong choice to play the lead here, but once again, time has mellowed out my reaction to that. He did a credible job along with the supporting cast, and the minor twist with Jean Reno's character was handled cleverly. What I had a little trouble processing though was how a lot of the characters in the story had a tough time making a phone call a mere eighteen years ago, when today the ubiquitous presence of cell phones makes it possible to communicate at a second's notice. Not to mention citizen journalists posting videos on youtube; it really makes you think.In deference to the film's critics, I do realize there was some extraordinarily goofy stuff going on in the picture along with the mayhem. Gunning the taxi out of the mouth of the resurrected Godzilla was a stretch by anyone's estimation, but hey, when it comes to monsters, action and big guns, I guess anything is to be expected. Even if you have to blow up Madison Square Garden to save the day.",Godzilla
5,gavin6942,Could Be Worse,5,27 May 2014,"An enormous, radioactively mutated lizard runs rampant in Manhattan.This was directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich, best known for directing ""Independence Day"". Whether or not he is a good director is hard to say, since he spends his time helming large disaster epics that owe more to things blowing up than a serious plot and character development. This is no exception.James Berardinelli wrote, ""Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-Manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind. The script isn't just 'dumbed down,' it's lobotomized. Godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone."" Indeed, as much as the film was panned by audiences and critics, even earning the Golden Raspberry for worst film of 1998, it also won a positive award: the Saturn Award for special effects. So Berardinelli nails it when he points out the film's strength. That being said, effects alone can never made a film good.Roger Ebert (who is lampooned in the film) wrote, ""One must carefully repress intelligent thought while watching such a film. The movie makes no sense at all except as a careless pastiche of its betters... You have to absorb such a film, not consider it. But my brain rebelled, and insisted on applying logic where it was not welcome."" Well played, Ebert.",Godzilla
6,lee_eisenberg,"In ""God"" we don't trust",2,25 April 2006,"Why, why, OH WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DO THIS?!!!!!!!! Seemingly, everyone should have considered the famous Japanese movies about the eponymous monster leveling Tokyo to be sacrosanct. But the people behind ""Independence Day"" obviously didn't. They turned the big guy into an overgrown iguana. And the plot? The ""plot"", if we can call it that, involves two hours of destruction. The major problem with movies like this is that we want to see more of the title character and less of the people trying to figure out what to do; but that's what makes it a formula movie. Can't they just make something with a real plot?! Oh, I forgot to mention the characters. They're the types whom you want to see get crushed by the monster. The movie wastes Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria (I don't recall Maria Pitillo from anything else; ""Godzilla"" may have ruined her chances). Kevin Dunn, Michael Lerner and Harry Shearer also star. They're probably embarrassed about this.So, avoid it at all costs.",Godzilla
7,jboothmillard,Godzilla,4,6 September 2005,"From Razzie nominated director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 BC), when I was younger I used to quite like this film, a remake of the famous Japanese original, but I had to see it again in my older age to get a definite opinion. Basically French nuclear tests have been going on in the Pacific Ocean, and it was observed by marine iguanas, so obviously the radiation has fused with one of these lizards to create a monster that first attacks Japan. Dr. Niko 'Nick' Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is investigating a giant footprint found on the border of New York City, and soon enough this large dinosaur like creature, Godzilla, rages through the skyscrapers to terrorise the people. They know that Godzilla is fulfilling some kind of need, so they decide to lure the monster back and plan their attack to pile a mountain of fish in the middle of a road, and then fire at the creature, but this plan doesn't work very well. Nick comes to the conclusion that Godzilla is asexual, which means that he/she will give birth to other babies that will also be pregnant and reproduce rapidly, but they supposedly manage to kill Godzilla on its way back to the ocean. Nick, French Secret Service agent Philippe Roaché (Jean Reno), Nick's ex-girlfriend and aspiring journalist Audrey Timmonds (Razzie winning Maria Pitillo) and cameraman Victor 'Animal' Palotti (The Simpsons' Hank Azaria) manage to find the nest in Madison Square Garden. The hundreds of eggs hatch and the baby Godzilla chase them, as they smell of fish, so they rush upstairs and try to get away from the creatures, and they manage to find a news casting room to give out a warning. The armed forces send out bomber planes to destroy the building, and all the babies are killed in the wreckage, but then all of the sudden Godzilla crashes through the floor and has returned, and it wants revenge for the death of her offspring. While trapped in a tunnel, Nick works out a way to possibly get the opportunity to attack Godzilla, by trapping the monster in a suspension bridge, so they head for Brooklyn Bridge, and it does indeed end up trapped in the suspension cables. It ends with Godzilla attacked by missiles and killed, Nick and Audrey possibly back together, and Roaché disappearing with Animal's camera footage of the monsters, but of course it returns to the wreckage of Madison Square Garden, where one egg remains and hatches. Also starring Small Soldiers' Kevin Dunn as Colonel Hicks, Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert, The Simpsons' Harry Shearer as Charles Caiman, Arabella Field as Lucy Palotti, Vicki Lewis as Dr. Elsie Chapman, Doug Savant as Sergeant O'Neal, Malcolm Danare as Dr. Mendel Craven and Lorry Goldman as Gene - Mayor's Aide. The cast are I guess fine, but it is obvious most attention is drawn to the monster, using some pretty alright special effects to create the roaring beast and the buildings being destroyed, I think the most memorable sequence is the characters chased in the building by the babies. I can see however why the critics give it two stars out of five, it is not all that scary or thrilling like the original version, and it does at times feel very cheesy, but if you do like an easy watch with some fun action and a fair amount of destruction then I guess this isn't terrible, a sometimes dreary but relatively alright monster horror disaster movie. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Okay!",Godzilla
8,ccthemovieman-1,"The Good & The Bad Of ""Godzilla'",6,21 April 2006,"Capitalizing on the success of the Jurassic Park films, here came Godzilla. Can it be this was out eight years ago? As often, especially with re-makes from classic films such as this '50s sci-fi one, there are a lot of ""good"" and ""bad.""THE GOOD - Great special effects with some tremendous action scenes. The story is generally interesting and I liked the characters played by Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. The strange creatures look pretty real, especially Godzilla's offspring. Despite all the violence there is no blood or gore, but I still think it's way too intense for kids and should be rated ""R.""THE BAD - Mostly annoying lead characters, some of which are painted as unrealistically dumb (the mayor and the sergeant). Maria Pitillo, as the lead female, is especially unlikeable and I can see why she never made it in on the big screen. The action and the noise gets to be too much, wearing out the viewer after awhile. Almost all of the last 40 minutes are pure action as the dinosaurs keep coming, one after the other after the other, even when they presumed dead. The filmmakers just don't know when to stop! Some of the chase scenes are too hokey as the people would have killed for certain. There are a couple of stupid sex remarks which serve no purpose in the film and too much usage of the Lord's name in vain, which also isn't needed. Like the King Kong re-make, it's too much action.",Godzilla
9,rmax304823,More Is Less.,4,29 January 2015,"No need to spend much time on this special effects extravaganza. Godzilla, a giant lizard the size of the Collosus of Rhodes, demolishes half of New York City in its quest for fish. Not quenelles de brochet or sole Florentine but sashimi, with or without wasabi. He's not fussy.The thing is really titanic. It emerges from the East River and smashes through buildings. The Army, with its small arms and heat-seeking missiles, can't do a thing with it because it's so big and it's cold blooded. The missiles bring down the Chrysler building.Now, any thriller of this caliber must have a car chase. But there's a problem. There are no villains to chase or be chased in a car. So we get to witness Godzilla in hot pursuit of a fleeing taxi through the streets of the city.There are scenes lifted from ""Jurassic Park"", in which dozens of Velocirapter-sized juvenals sniff around Madison Square Garden, ready to try red meat instead of fish, regardless of the threat to their health.There is a famous scene towards the end of ""Wait Until Dark"" in which the supposedly dead killer leaps suddenly onto the screen, making a grab for Audrey Hepburn. It's a real shocker. Just about every horror movie since then has copied it. Here, it's copied twice. Godzilla, bombarded, groans and sinks to the bottom of the river.The end? Not on your life. He was pregnant and has deposited a couple of dozen eggs in Madison Square Garden. They all hatch simultaneously, sans egg teeth, and the stars now have a horde of new enemies to defeat. They eventually do so, at great sacrifice. Not only are some French troops killed (don't ask) but Madison Square Garden itself is obliterated.The end? That's what you might think. But -- Lo! -- Godzilla emerges intact, full of pee and vinegar, from the ruins of the Garden and is thoroughly annoyed by the death of all its spawn. More battles ensue.The score can't decide whether it would rather imitate Night on Bald Mountain or Bernard Herrmann, so it rips passages off from both sources, pounding the tympani was megabels of drums and electronic percussion. If a helicopter gently touches down on its landing pad, the first contact of the nose wheel is a loud WHOMP. There is no acting to speak of. None is required. It's a commercial spectacle with unbelievable holes in the story and in the subway system. The impact of having seen this movie is indistinguishable from that of having been hit over the head with a crowbar.See it if you must.",Godzilla
10,ma-cortes,New version based on Japanese classic monster with excessive computer generator FX,6,20 March 2009,"An underwater prehistoric reptile emerges from the depths destroying ships and people . The monster terrorizes New York and its Great Apple, breaking buildings and everything to get in its ways.

Other various characters cross paths with the giant mutant, as a French agent (Jean Reno) and two reporters (Hank Azaria, Maria Pitillo).This is a roller-coaster ride plenty of action-packed , thrills ,chills and breathtaking scenes. Fun moments and frightening entertainment when astonishing appearance of the enormous Godzilla happens . Ending scenes located in Madison Square Garden are ripped off from Spielberg's Jurasik Park . Patrick Tatopoulos' design creature is well and brilliantly made . Stirring and moving musical score by David Arnold. The motion picture was middlingly directed by Roland Emmerich.

11,BA_Harrison,Good Godzilla.,7,29 August 2011,"Monster movie purists gave Roland Emmerich's Godzilla a bit of a mauling when it was first released. The reasons for their discontent were multitudinous: it was an Americanised version of a Japanese creation; the new creature design barely resembled the original; the creature changed size throughout the film; there was an over-reliance on CGI; the acting was poor (particularly from Maria Pitiful... sorry, I mean Maria Pitillo); the film turned into Jurassic Park halfway through.Admittedly, many of these complaints held some degree of water, but what many people neglected to mention was that, despite all of these things, the film was also hugely entertaining—chock full of top notch special effects and spectacular action sequences. Even though, at a whopping 133 minutes, the film is unnecessarily long, I don't think I could ever tire of a huge, mutated lizard stomping Manhattan and have no hesitation in recommending this film to anyone who enjoys big-budget creature features. Sure, it may be dumb, but it's also a lot of fun.",Godzilla
12,moonspinner55,Sell it on its size--the rest will take care of itself...,2,2 April 2006,"Clumsy, elephantine monster-movie remake of a 1954 Japanese cult classic; an overachieving, multiplex-equivalent of a drive-in theater quickie. Mass hysteria grips the world after a mysterious terror causes destruction and death near Panama; biologist Matthew Broderick is lured away from his Chernobyl earthworms to help determine the cause and effect of an Atom Bomb-created modern day dinosaur. What could be worse than Godzilla in New York City? Maybe a dinosaur-sized Hollywood blockbuster designed to break the bank but engineered without a trace of nostalgia (the picture pretty much throws out the campy fun of the original at the outset, instead replacing it with smarmy ""wit"" and actors forced to scream at each other). Broderick, as Dr. Niko Tatopoulos--whose last name keeps getting mispronounced--sings showtunes in his truck but does have an ex-college sweetheart back home (don't worry folks--he's straight!); he gets sexually harassed by his female boss within his first day on the new job--while back home in NYC, ex-flame Maria Pitillo gets harassed by her boss as well, and yet the filmmakers don't even seem to make the connection (it's all just ""cute""). Jean Reno looks entirely out of place with his low-keyed nods and stammers as investigator Philippe Roaché (his last name gets mispronounced as well), getting in the way of the military while making subtle, pointed observations (he's like the Truffaut character in ""Close Encounters""). As an action flick, the film is pumped full of wheezing prestige and misguided ambition, too much of it for the picture to be any fun. As a career killer, it did send Broderick back to Broadway. * from ****",Godzilla
13,Quinoa1984,"Dumb, yet entertaining",4,27 June 2000,"After seeing Roland Emmerich;s Godzilla remake, I like it, but after a while, it got boring (especially after seeing it the 4th time projected). But, it never stops getting entertaining (especially when you got the team that did Independence Day) despite stupid (yet sometimes funny) dialogue from the stars (Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, etc.).

16,hitchcockthelegend,The hype was as big as the monster to start with!,5,4 March 2008,"It felt like this take on Godzilla was advertised for 2 years in advance of the actual release, every time (it seemed) I went to the cinema I was awestruck by little teaser trailers, in fact the one of the old guy fishing and hooking Zilla is a personal favourite...SIZE DOES MATTER! Love it I do. Sadly as most of us now know, the film didn't meet fans and critics expectations at all, but was the film done down by the hype and an expectation of a masterpiece for the genre?.Well it didn't help that is for sure, but taking aside that problem, the film only glimpses at what might have been. It has many great points that seem to have been forgotten, so sadly we are all too aware of the film's failings on the makers behalf. The build up in the film is excellent, the makers mount the tension in steady strokes, doing what all classic monster movie makers do, they have you waiting with gripping expectation of the creature by a series of scenarios and inventive dialogue. The sound is incredible, making it an essential viewing for those who cherish home surround cinema, while some of the shots and destruction of New York are well worth the viewers time.But then? Well they throw the good work away by turning the film's focus away from the big lizard to a story line that was only fitting for the cartoon version of Godzooki. Thus rendering the film as a poor man's Jurassic Park, which quite frankly doesn't sit well. Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria all deserved better scripting, hell we all did!It's not the evil stinker some would have you believe, it does have its moments of both good and bad, it is, by definition, very much a film split down the middle. 5/10",Godzilla

Matthew Broderick as ""the worm guy"" and Jean Reno as the French Secret agent deliver quite watchable performances as they investigate some radioactive shipping incidents and some really big footprints. The special effects are decent enough too and help carry this admittedly too long little movie. Roland Emmerich & Dean Devlin are quite good at churning out these adventure films - never great, but usually they move along nicely and keep you entertained. This does that fine.",Godzilla
18,poolandrews,"""What is this? The virgin lizard?"" I loved it.",9,14 April 2006,"Godzilla starts as a Japanese cannery ship is attacked by something massive from the depths of the Ocean, the following day a Japanese crew-member talks of 'Gojira'... US atomic energy commission biologist Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is an expert on radiation mutated lifeforms & is asked by the US military to assist them on a case where a giant footprint has been discovered, a footprint that couldn't have been made by any known living creature. Shortly after a giant lizard tramples his way through Manhattan causing death & destruction as he trashes the place. Tatopoulos & the military headed up by Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn) are hot on it's tail & are determined to destroy it although that proves harder than first thought as Gojira is fast, strong, aggressive & very intelligent. Meanwhile Niko's ex girlfriend news reporter Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) sense she can get inside information on Gojira, which ends up being mispronounced by the American media as Godzilla, this gets Niko into trouble, taken off the team & discredited even though he thinks that Godzilla may have laid eggs which will hatch soon, overrun the city & eventually the world...Co-written, co-executive produced & directed by Roland Emmerich I have to say right now that I loved Godzilla & for that I make no apology whatsoever. Obviously based on the creaky old Japanese Toho series that featured Godzilla this big budget American take on things has NOTHING to do with them at all apart from the Godzilla name which is more than fine with me. Everyone who dislikes this Godzilla seem to 'fondly' remember the originals but I firmly believe that they are really overrated, the special effects are pathetic, the English dialogue & dubbing are unintentionally hilarious & I think most people these days would have a hard time liking them & I also believe that people say they like them because they probably have good childhood memories of them. Anyway, I thought this Godzilla was everything that I want to see in a monster film, it moves along like a rocket, it's never dull or boring & delivers some of the best popcorn entertainment I've ever seen. The special effects are spectacular even today, there isn't much of a story but again I remind you that the Japanese Godzillas didn't either, the character's are likable even the comedy relief Mayor & his sidekick, you can actually understand the dialogue & the film just provides wonderful monster sized fun! Was I the only one who felt just a teeny weeny bit sad at Godzillas death? Call me a softie but I liked the big fella & felt sorry for the guy when he never actually deliberately set out to kill or even hurt anyone, he was just doing what came naturally. On the negative side I felt it went on for a bit too long & I just couldn't get past the fact that someone could lose a gigantic monster in New York, it's not like someone might not notice it walking down the street, is it? I mean it's big enough for someone not to lose it.Director Emmerich gives his audience a brilliant & exhilarating roller-coaster ride of thrilling set pieces from helicopter gunship chases, a fantastic taxi cab chase through the streets of Manhattan, explosions, underwater sequences, dozens of baby Godzillas running around Madison Square Garden, a great ending scene set on a suspension bridge & some cool shots of Godzilla trampling his way through the streets of New York. The film has a certain gloomy atmosphere as it is always raining, in fact 2.4 million gallons of water was used for the rain during filming. That's a lot of water.With a supposed budget of about £125,000,000 this had a massive budget which shows, the special effects are brilliant & are still among the best ever put on film. I love the new Godzilla design even though many didn't. One thing I must add is that I hated the soundtrack, I found it totally inappropriate & just didn't suit the on screen action at all, it seemed more suited for a romantic film, very strange. The acting was OK, Pitillo was cute, Jean Reno was cool & Simpsons fans will spot voice regulars Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer & Nancy Cartwright here.A lot of people hate this film which is fine, I really couldn't care less what other's think because films are all about personal opinion & my opinion of Godzilla is that I loved it & thought it was everything I wanted it to be. I can't recommend it as so many people seem to dislike it & I appear to be in the minority, I still think it's brilliant though, it's as simple & straight forward as that.",Godzilla
19,utgard14,Better than I remembered,6,30 August 2016,"Like many people, I wasn't fond of this when it was first released. Revisiting it now nearly twenty years later I can say my opinion has changed quite a bit. It's still not a great Godzilla movie, at least not how I quantify that, but it is an enjoyable ""big monster movie"" on its own merits. The special effects are great, the action is pretty well staged, and the music is surprisingly nice. The only real problems for me are that the cast is a little too goofy at times (I think they were going for some kind of Jurassic Park humorous/serious blend) and the movie does run a little long. Overall, though, I think it's an entertaining movie that deserves a second look.",Godzilla

I didn't like him in either.But, I watched this for another chance to see Jean Reno. He was as great here as in Ronin, and funny, too. I am afraid, I will have to get Showtime to see more of him.I have to admit that Michael Lerner was funny as the Mayor, as was Kevin Dunn as Colonel Hicks.

The radioactive materials changed one of them into a skyscraper tall predator that asexually reproduces itself, about twenty or more eggs at a time. The American military and the French Secret Service work hand-in-hand to defeat the eponymous reptile, but neither know that they are working the service of the other. Caught in the middle between enigmatic, undercover, French Secret Service Agent Philippe Roaché (Jan Reno) and strident U.S. Army Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn of ""Transformers"") are Dr. Niko ""Nick"" Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick of ""War Games""), wannabe television news reporter Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo of ""Chaplin""), and television videographer Victor 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria of ""Homegrown"") who are trying to survive, get a story on the humongous beast, and kill it. ""Aladdin"" co-scribes Ted Elliot and Terry Rosio contributed to the story that Emmerich and Devlin wrote. When Emmerich and Devlin aren't trying to make us laugh, they try to convince us that ordinary lizards could mutate as a consequence of nuclear radiation and turn into leviathans. The real-life lizards that inhabit these islands served as the prototypes for their Godzilla who barely resembles the Toho character. First, this Godzilla looks more like Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" dinos. Second, this Godzilla doesn't breathe radioactive fire. Third, Godzilla shuns Tokyo as his usual stomping grounds and plunges into the Big Apple where it lays eggs galore in Madison Square Garden. Emmerich and company weave a romance into the action with Audrey struggling to rekindle her botched romance with Nick. Nick, it seems, still loves Audrey, but she had to find herself a career before she would marry him. Not long after the military bring Nick in on their project, Audrey meets him and takes a videotape that reveals the origins of the monster. Unfortunately, the comedy undercuts the horror and Godzilla emerges as a resourceful but goofy looking creature. The showdown in New York is consistently exciting with swarms of ""Blue Thunder"" like attack helicopters unleashing their firepower on Big G. Ironically, in the words of the mayor, the military does more damage trying to kill Godzilla than Godzilla does. There is a clever ending, too. Broderick is ideally cast as Nick, and Azaria looks believable as a news videographer. Godzilla lurks in the background at different points and then stomps Manhattan with a vengeance. Shots of Godzilla's gigantic feet recur through this 143 minute monster epic. One amusing scene that stands out involves a little old guy who goes fishing off a pier and hooks Godzilla. Emmerich ratchets up the suspense and tension near the end of the film when our heroes find themselves trapped in a building with dozens of young Godzillas that have fed but are about to fed again. Another amusing scene has Nick turning over a gumball machine so that the dinos wind up slip-sliding away. ""Godzilla"" earned just shy of 400 million internationally and it is flawed but spectacular reboot that didn't kick hard enough to warrant a sequel.",Godzilla
22,Calicodreamin,A bit hokey,5,6 January 2020,"While the cinematography, cgi, and acting aren't too bad, the whole thing just comes off as a bit hokey. For the most part there isn't much of a plot and the storyline could have been streamlined by cutting out some unnecessary bits. The dialogue itself leaves something to be desired. Not a terrible experience, but I definitely don't feel the need to watch again.",Godzilla
23,Boba_Fett1138,Dumb entertainment but it works.,6,1 March 2006,"Of course most blockbuster are 'dumb' and over-the-top movies, with a simple and silly story and shallow characters. ""Godzilla"" however really pushes it at times. The movie is at times insulting to our intelligence and the story and storytelling is heavily lacking. Still ""Godzilla"" does what it's supposed to do; It brings more than enough entertainment to have a pleasant evening.The movie has almost totally nothing to do with the Japanese versions of Godzilla (or better said; Gojira.). It has a totally different atmosphere, feeling and approach. ""Godzilla"" is a very Hollywoodized version of the well known Japanese creature. No wonder most of the fans of the Japanese movies were extremely disappointing with this movie and perhaps even mad. Still, if you have to judge the movie for what it is, you still come to the conclusion that ""Godzilla"" has an entertainment value.It's too bad that the story and storytelling of it in the movie are so weak. The movie is incredibly simple and the movie lacks some fundamental things, a movie of this proportion needs. The movie lacks a real good and likable main character and exciting memorable scene's. Sure there are action-sequences in the movie but it honestly isn't something that we haven't already seen before. The movie lacks a real feeling of danger and panic. I mean, hello there's a giant lizard walking loose in New York, causing mayhem but yet nobody is busy surviving or is in real panic. Some of the elements in the movie are unbelievably bad and insulting to the viewer's its intelligence. It's just all too simple to leave a real lasting impression. Also the dialog is just plain bad at times.The special effects are good. Seriously, come on what is everybody complaining about? The special effects are convincing, especially considering that this is a 1998 movie. Yes, the movie is made deliberately dark and rainy to conceal the fact that the special effects aren't that advanced yet but hey it works doesn't it? It might not all impress very much but it's all very convincing looking.Roland Emmerich certainly isn't a bad blockbuster movie-maker but he really pushed it with this movie at times. There are still some good and entertaining moments in the movie which all still makes this movie a very watchable one. Also the musical score from action-movie composer David Arnold is quite good.Good enough entertainment, that perhaps deserves just a little bit more credit than it's getting right now at the moment.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Godzilla
24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"It's decent, I guess",6,1 November 2003,"It has a few good action scenes, but the whole film is just too slow(and possibly too long... did this perhaps take itself too seriously? As in, *way* too seriously?), and most of the scenes are boring. The pacing could have used work, as could the plot, and come on, any attempt made earlier in the film to turn the creature into something reasonably realistic and explain it all away goes away the instant ""Godzilla""... yeah, I won't say it here, but other viewers may already be aware what I'm referring to(and hey, if not, feel free to drop me a line and ask... my bite's not as bad as the title creature's). I must admit, part of this film, maybe 20-30 minutes of it(I'm referring to a specific portion), entertained me more than the entirety of Jurassic Park(why is that movie so popular?). The end scene is also somewhat interesting to watch. Something that got my attention was the number of Simpsons actors in this: Hank Azaria(Animal), Harry Shearer(Caiman) & Nancy Cartwright(Caiman secretary). I found that to be a funny coincidence, if it was a coincidence, that is(or is someone in the casting department rounding them up? I'm not aware of any other movie with that many of them). Somewhat entertaining, and maybe worth a single watch, if you can stand to sit through the whole thing(or jump to lay past the half of it). 6/10",Godzilla
25,anaconda-40658,Stomp On This Film.,2,16 June 2015,"Godzilla (1998): Dir: Roland Emmerich / Cast: Matthew Broderick, Maria Pitillo, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn: The big lizard is a big two hour long spectacle where special effects replace plot. The image of Godzilla looks great but its story is littered with stupidity. It is never established where this freak of nature came from and how it has survived. Matthew Broderick plays a biologist assigned to figure out what made the giant footprints. His ex-girlfriend is a reporter used by her boss. Godzilla develops the ability to hide from helicopters in the city. It eventually reaches the same height of stupidity as The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Directed by Roland Emmerich who made the over-hyped Independence Day, which is another overrated stupid spectacle. Broderick is at his worst while Maria Pitillo is unbearable as an idiot reporter. Together they pull off performances that would warrant having a jacket over their head during any career retrospect. Appearing in laughable performances are Jean Reno, Kevin Dunn and Hank Azaria who really shouldn't be proud to be part of this over budget circus fiasco. How many stupid Godzilla movies are they going to make before they get it right? This version may be the worst version yet and that is saying something when one factors in the budget of this bullshit. Pointless noise that is about as entertaining as an episode of Barney.

26,Aaron1375,So why wasn't Godzilla in the movie?,4,22 March 2001,"This is a movie I looked forward to for a year. I have always enjoyed Godzilla flicks and now we the Americans were going to make it with all our special effects and know how. I can not tell you how disappointed I was with this movie. One of my main gripes (and certainly not the only one) was Godzilla himself/herself. It looked nothing like the Japan version. It sounded like him (because theirs is a guy) and that is it. I heard that Sony had to show them our version before hand and Toho had to approve...why did they approve of that? Not only did it not look like Godzilla, but it did not act like Godzilla. Godzilla does not burrow underground he just stomps through the city. Suffice to say those missiles would have crashed into him with no effect. Godzilla is bigger than they portrayed as well, and he breaths much cooler looking fire breath that the American version. Let's face it the Japan version would kick our version's but in about five minutes, the only reason it would last that long is the fact is moved like a raptor from Jurrassic Park. It was also killed to easily, the Japan version would never be taken down that easily...they always have to come up with some new and innovative way of getting him back in the sea, not just slam a couple of missiles into him. And what is up with him being pregnant, sure the Japan version had a son that was never quite explained, but ours has to have a litter of raptors. And Godzilla is not a lizard, but a dinosaur a mix of T-rex and stegosaurus. I would have had a sub accident in the polar region to have him born, because I have never heard of a creature migrating north to give birth. Then of course there is the story that was dumb...they evacuated the city in five minutes so there goes the fun of seeing people flee, you get to see a woman trying to advance her reporting career (was that really necessary), and our military is hardly in the film except for a few scenes, yet the French military is for some reason (I don't think they could have ever traced Godzilla back to them).",Godzilla
27,Wuchakk,King of the monster movies!,8,6 October 2013,"I don't get the flack Roland Emmerich's ""Godzilla"" (1998) receives. The criticisms come in two forms or a combination: (1.) Godzilla purists complain that the monster is different than the one in the classic Godzilla movies, and (2.) others complain that the film is what it is -- a story about a 200-foot tall dino-lizard attacking New York City.As far as the first point goes, so it deviates from the Japanese Godzilla, so what? The hailed 1982 version of ""Conan the Barbarian"" deviated a lot from (creator) Robert E. Howard's version but that didn't stop people from loving it. Or how about ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan"" (1984), how faithful was that to Burrough's book? ""Godzilla 1998"" is an American re-interpretation, what's the big deal? Besides, the behemoth as depicted in the 1954 original ""Godzilla"" was actually cute. The last time I saw that film it was impossible for me to take Godzilla's attack seriously -- he was too cute! In other words, the filmmakers HAD to change the monster's look to make him more threatening-looking. As for the second point, this is a film about a giant lizard attacking a city, why would anyone expect ""Gandhi""?My title blurb calls this the ""king of the monster movies"", and so it is! However, the tone is more akin to Indiana Jones than the ultra-serious vibe of, say, ""Aliens"" or ""War of the Worlds"". Remember the scene in ""Jurassic Park"" where the T-Rex chases the vehicle? ""Godzilla"" has a similar scene except that the monster is 200-feet high rather than 20-feet. Remember the great velociraptor scenes? ""Godzilla"" has similar scenes except that there are a couple hundred creatures rather than just a few. In short, ""Godzilla"" is like ""Jurassic Park"" on total overdrive. This may make it less realistic, but it's arguably more entertaining. In my opinion it is: although the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" are great, the story isn't that compelling and the characters are weak. ""Godzilla"" by contrast has more drive and a better cast.Speaking of the cast, Matthew Broderick plays the likable protagonist, Maria Pitillo his wannabe-reporter girlfiend, Hank Azaria a photographer, Jean Reno a French military officer intent on destroying the monster, Kevin Dunn the American colonel in charge of the New York operations, Michael Lerner the mayor of New York and Lorry Goldman his aide. The latter two amusingly spoof Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel evidently because these critics trashed Emmerich's previous two films (and I agree that ""Independence Day"" was lame).Speaking of Roger Ebert, he of course gave ""Godzilla"" a very low rating (1.5 Stars) and criticized it like so: ""Going to see ""Godzilla"" at the Palais of the Cannes Film Festival is like attending a satanic ritual in St. Peter's Basilica. It's a rebuke to the faith that the building represents."" But isn't this the same same guy who gave 2005's ""King Kong"" a perfect rating? What's strange with this is, as cartoony and unrealistic as ""Godzilla"" is, ""King Kong"" is at least three times worse in this regard; in fact, it's like a live-action Road Runner cartoon (Remember that moronic brontosaurus stampede sequence? Or how about the scene where one guy shoots the big bugs off another guy with a machine gun? You can't get any more stoo-pid). And yet Ebert praises ""King Kong"", but ""Godzilla"" is supposedly a terrible film. Not only is this absurd, since ""Godzilla"" is the better film, but it reveals a double standard. Maybe Ebert is good buddies with Peter Jackson, who knows?Broderick and Reno shine here and the rest of the cast are effective. The weak point is the women. Maria Pitillo is a quality female protagonist, very cute, but the filmmakers don't do enough with her. Vicki Lewis plays a scientist but her role is very minor. And Arabella Field's role is even smaller (although that's not necessarily a bad thing since her character is so annoying). Needless to say, weak job on this front.The film also has an entertaining soundtrack, including some ""Kashmir.""FINAL SAY: ""Godzilla"" is just a great turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast flick. It has the fun air of Indiana Jones and The Mummy films. It takes the concept of a giant monster attacking a city and goes totally over-the-top, but not to the ridiculous extent of Jackson's ""King Kong"" cartoon. Lastly, if you think the only menace to the city is the 200-foot tall creature, you're wrong!The film runs 139 minutes.GRADE: A-",Godzilla
28,zetes,"Messy and stupid, but kind of fun",6,11 October 2014,"I missed this back when it came out (was in college and had to work the night everyone else went to see it), but have always been told I hadn't missed anything. I got re-interested after the new one was released. I was disappointed with that one. I had no real expectations for this one, therefore I didn't find it all that bad. I liked it slightly better than the new one. For one, the cast is way better, or at least they're used better. Matthew Broderick is miscast, but he's not bad. Jean Reno is great. I liked the lead actress, Maria Pitillo (who won a Razzie for her effort). Sure, she's not a great actress, but she's nice to look at. Half of the Simpsons cast is represented. Michael Lerner plays Mayor Ebert (with his tall, bald assistant, Gene). And Vicki Lewis. Man, I miss her. The special effects haven't held up that well, and the action is ridiculous, but it's mostly fun. Like the new one, there are too many long stretches without monsters, which kills the pacing dead.",Godzilla
29,SimonJack,Jurassic Manhattan quickly fizzles,4,24 September 2018,"New York City replaces Tokyo in this 1998 rendition or ""Godzilla."" But this American remake of the 1954 Japanese film fizzles in comparison. Even with modern film technology, this film can't hold a candle to the original. Indeed, the modern technology is part of the drawback in this film. It's not all of the poor aspects, but part of them. And that's mostly in the CGI. The computer images of the giant monster racing through the streets, between the towering buildings of Manhattan, just seem so phony and unreal. Much of the set seems to be computer drawn rather than actual locales. As amateurish as the 1954 method of miniature monster models and sets were, shot in black and white and with excellent special effects, they seemed so much more real. Even watching that film these decades later, it still seems more real than this 1998 film. The imagery Is only part of the weakness of this film. The mayhem just keeps piling on in this one - way overdone. The script is hokey and weak. And this film just doesn't have a fright factor - none at all. From the start, Matthew Broderick's character has an easy-going, light-hearted demeanor. His Dr. Niko Tatopoulos borders on humorous just enough to convey to the audience that this film is going to be a fun ride with lots of CGI, but not to worry, it won't be frightening. Without a fright factor, no film in the monsters genre works. In the effort to tie the source of the monster to nuclear testing, TriStar opens the film with scenes that show lizards, the dragons of Bali, and other animal life. That's followed by a nuclear explosion, the mushroom cloud and devastation. But, the Godzilla in this film turns out to be mistakan at first as something from the dinosaur age. Indeed, it looks and moves just like the Velociraptors of the 1993 film, ""Jurassic Park"" - only many times larger. 
Unfortunately, this giant velociraptor loose in Manhattan is more boring than entertaining.",Godzilla
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,A 20 foot giant lizard can disappear in New York City?,2,15 May 2004,"Godzilla, one of the major monster classics that we all know and love, mainly of course with the old badly dubbed Japenese films. As badly made those films were, they were still incredibly fun because of all the camp. It was just a good time to watch those movies and Godzilla was just freaky looking and scared the heck out of you. So naturally the men who created the big time special effects movies like Independence Day and Stargate would naturally try and re-create the gigantic lizard and you guessed it, put him in today's New York City. Now who are we going to rely on to save us? Arnold Schwartzenegger, Syvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Jackie Chan? Nope, Ferris Bueller, er, I mean Matthew Broderick. He plays a nerd in this movie, so who better to save us? Godzilla is barely recongnizable as he is just a CGI love fest where it seems that the creators were not even close to what Godzilla really looked like in the old films. Oh, this was a bad movie.A Japanese fishing ship is attacked by an unseen, giant monster that attacks from below the water: only one sailor survives. Traumatized, he is questioned in a hospital by a French scientist as to what he saw. His only reply is Godzilla. Dr. Nick Tatopoulos, an NRC scientist, researching the effects of radiation on earth worms, is interrupted by the arrival of an agent of the U.S. State Department. He is sent to Panama, escorted by the military, to observe the wreckage of the recovered Japanese fishing ship and a set of massive dinosaur-like footprints in the grassy soil. The Frenchman is also there, observing the scene and introduces himself as an insurance agent. Aboard a military aircraft, Tatopolous identifies skin samples he recovered as belonging to an animal ""unknown to science"". He dismisses the military's theory that the creature is a reawakened dinosaur, theorising that its origins in French Polynesia make it a mutant created by nuclear testing. An old man is seen fishing on the dock. He takes a bite from his fishing rod, and a big wave comes toward him after a few minutes of trying to pull in his line. The big wave happens to be Godzilla, and he emerges from the dock. Godzilla then travels to Manhattan and creates havoc in the city, killing dozens of people. Godzilla is revealed to be a gigantic, bipedal lizard that towers over much of the New York skyline. The city is evacuated and the military attempt to kill Godzilla, first luring it out with a huge pile of fish (the creature's staple diet). It takes the bait, but is scared off by small arms fire, but oddly enough, it's just not working on the giant lizard.That's pretty much a good enough ""summary"" of the movie, there's more in the movie than that, but it's kind of pointless to mention as this movie was just pointless to make. It's just badly written, the special effects are way over the top and obvious to anyone, and the actors are just so out of place it's insane. Now is this the worst movie of all time? I wouldn't say so, but it is just a bad movie over all, I wouldn't really recommend it. Godzilla just doesn't belong in America, especially since our government is stupid enough to constantly loose a gigantic lizard in NEW YORK CITY! So I wouldn't recommend this film, it's just a stupid way of killing time, you could be doing more useful things like the dishes.2/10",Godzilla

It's not that the film is just stupid. All blockbusters are, after all. It's that Roland Emmerich is so inept here at delivering any sort of entertainment value -- the film takes itself way too seriously for a summer popcorn flick, trying to insert depth and dialogue - both backfire miserably.Matthew Broderick is sorely miscast as the lead hero and Jean Reno has perhaps the only good role in the entire film.The CGI sequences are alright I suppose but compared to today's effects, they're outdated -- and when a film relies entirely on effects to wow over its audience, you know it's in trouble.The end of the film turns into ""Jurassic Park"" with little Godzillas running around chasing people like Raptors.This movie is too long, too stupid, too pretentious and too boring.",Godzilla

33,OllieSuave-007,"It's Godzilla, American style.",4,12 June 2007,"The majority of Godzilla fans probably despise this movie because it doesn't stay true to the original Godzilla character. People even named this film GINO (Godzilla In Name Only). Even the Japanese poked fun at it, dubbing it as ""Zilla."" I didn't care too much about this film after I first saw it. It is basically just another monster-on-the-loose movie; the producers just decided to borrow the ""Godzilla"" name for marque value and put the monster in its own flavor. I guess they couldn't completely imitate the original Godzilla movie.This movie begins with the aftermath of French atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific. After the explosions, it was discovered that a gigantic monster dubbed Godzilla rose out of the water and the scientists concluded that Godzilla is an irradiated lizard created by the explosions. Godzilla then makes its way to New York and begins wreaking havoc. It's somewhat entertaining-lots of monster destruction, with the military frantically trying to save the Big Apple from the Big Guy. The atomic bomb theme is surely a homage to how the original Godzilla was created. The acting, though, was unremarkable and very campy. The Godzilla design wasn't that good - looking more like an overgrown lizard than the original Godzilla. There are also monster scenes where the filmmakers ripped off elements from Jurassic Park and Aliens - no originality. While some of the action was entertaining, the story itself is dull and boring. I personally am glad, in a way, that this movie was made because the demand for the Godzilla franchise grew in America in anticipation for the film's release, which resulted in Godzilla merchandise to be exported in America, including the release of the remaining original Godzilla sequels from Toho: Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla and Godzilla vs. Destoroyah. Toys and video games related to the King of the Monsters were in high demand, and the book ""The Official Godzilla Compendium"" was published. Everything you wanted to know about the 22 original Godzilla movies (made by the original Godzilla producer), and his foes and allies like Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah and Gigan, can be found in this book. When I bought this book in 1998, my brother (also an avid Godzilla fan) and I were ecstatic. At that time, we had not seen all the Godzilla movies and this book revealed the missing movies we haven't watch, and much more. All thanks, ironically, to the American ""Godzilla"" film.But overall, a below average movie. If you're a hardcore Godzilla fan, stay away. If you're a general and casual fan of sci-fi action, give this a watch, but don't expect a masterpiece. Grade D",Godzilla
34,sddavis63,A Dreadful Remake,2,19 July 2019,"I suppose there are sometimes valid reasons for remaking classic movies. Whatever the reason was for this remake, though - it was definitely the wrong reason! This is truly atrocious in almost every way. The acting wasn't great (although I'll admit that Matthew Broderick seemed to be trying his best even while he wasn't being especially convincing), the script was weak, and there was too much of an attempt to make this a sort-of comedy, with lame bits of humour being thrown in that to be honest weren't really all that funny. It's hard to figure out how this went wrong. You have a huge dinosaur wreaking havoc in New York City! That, by the way, caused me confusion. Why did Godzilla make this trek from the Pacific, through the Panama Canal and to New York City? Was that ever explained? If it was, I missed it. But at the very least, Godzilla in New York City alone should be fun. But it wasn't. This turned out to be the sort of movie I'd glance at every few minutes to see if I had missed anything - and I'd immediately realize that I hadn't missed a thing. It was just an all round poor production. Based on the look of Godzilla and some of the effects I'd guess this was kind of inspired by the success of Jurassic Park a few years earlier, but it was lacking in spark. I'd really be tempted to give this a 1/10, but given that there have been other remakes of ""Godzilla"" since that I haven't seen, I'll give this a 2 and leave the 1 available, just in case one of the more recent remakes is even worse - although it's hard to believe that would be possible.",Godzilla
35,thesar-2,"Brains Matter, Too",3,22 April 2013,"Godzilla (1998) needs to be added to my list of movies I continuously revisit despite being terrible and that I want so bad to like more.I remember back in 1998 when I first saw this: It was one of my most anticipated movies for me in a long time. For, I grew up with Godzilla as a kid, though I couldn't tell you how many of the Japanese films I've seen. Just whatever was on Saturday Afternoons on TV. So, I thought: damn, here's Godzilla, with a budget and on American soil! And I love Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria and it also starred my soap-dish show's Doug Savant, from Melrose Place!I could NOT have been more let down than if Hank Azaria, himself, provided a voice for Godzilla.During my first viewing, I did all I could to get past the absolute trash of campiness they didn't need to hold onto. The horrid dialogue, bad acting and jokes that were as flat as anything under Godzilla's feet. I tried to forgive them to missing the mark and opportunity and said to myself: ""Let's get to the goods!""When we finally did, and Godzilla revealed his new ""look"" I couldn't stop laughing. Sure the special effects were decent, and I knew where they were going by transforming his Rubber-Suit-Man into a more ""realistic"" lizard giant, but dang, he couldn't have looked more ridiculous. No wonder they never revealed his full body, or at least warped and hilarious head, to the media prior to the movie playing.Oh, and here's a spoiler, but don't worry; it's your fault if you haven't yet seen this 15-year-old movie. They rip off the very movie they're trying to top: Jurassic Park. The entire marketing campaign, namely ""Size Does Matter,"" was trying to spit on the everlasting champ in this genre but, instead, steals the raptor scenes with the climax of this film. It was pathetic.The basic synopsis follows the previous synopsis of the established Godzilla series: radioactive (or nuclear) activity grows a lizard to, I don't know, 100,000 times of its original size, although Matthew Broderick's character says it's a ""brand new species."" And said monster believes New York City would be perfect for raising its youth. Um, it's not even good for humans, but maybe Godzilla first spoke with the rats and thought differently.The Gomer Pyle lead military decides it's best to blow up half the city in order to stop the beast after a convenient, albeit unrealistic, evacuation of 10 million people in a matter of minutes. When one doctor (Broderick) suggests feeding the beast is a good idea, the doofuses listen, comply and instead of killing Godzilla, they obliterate much of Manhattan while lacking any results.Meanwhile, a dizzy blonde, whom you'll grow to hate, wants her man, said doctor, back while stealing a story to advance at her news station.I just threw that in for the most inept and ridiculous subplots thrown in. There's many more, and sadly, the bulk of the movie revolves around live-action cartoon characters and their selfish lives while a monster threatens real estate.I digress. Godzilla lays some eggs and this causes more threats and the doctor's theories. Enter the Raptor Rip-off Chase scenes.Admittedly, if you get past the 80% of camp and cheese, some of the Godzilla chases were fun, but that's a lot to ask. In the beginning of my review, I said this is one I return to regularly, or say, every 3-4 years, and want to like it more, but blasted, I hate life when all I remembered was that 20% of good footage.In 2014, I've heard they plan on yet another reboot of this franchise. Oddly, I have high hopes again. I really do. I think they've learned from their mistakes here and despite the 16 year gap, or worse, 60 years since the original, they will take their time with a story that can be told, with actors that don't speak lines from a three-year-old's mind and with an even better threat to us than a military that couldn't stop an ant colony from gathering leaves.Skip this one, wait for 2014.",Godzilla

37,g-bodyl,Not Bad!,8,8 June 2008,"Godzilla is a better film than I had expected. I brought this film for a cheap price because I wanted to see if this film was entertaining. It was for the most part. This film revolves around a giant monster the size of a dinosaur destroying New York City and having many babies. I think that the plot was pretty good. Some things don't make sense, but this film is just meant for fun. The acting is a little shabby and weak. Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno are fine. Maria Pitillo does need some acting lessons. The soundtrack is great especially the end credits music. The technical stuff for Godzilla was great. The special effects are decent. This film can be scary to little kids. I rate this film a 8/10.",Godzilla
38,CuriosityKilledShawn,Hit and miss.,5,7 May 2004,"After scoring a huge hit with ID4 everyone expected Roland Emmerich to really impress us with this movie. Godzilla had a lot to live up to. It disappointed on every level imaginable. The only way to enjoy this is as purely brain-dead nonsense. Think about it and you'll realize how bad it is. So seriously, switch your brain off.The problems mainly lie with the fact that Godzilla himself is very unremarkable. He's just a giant lizard. Hardly threatening. And like Matthew Broderick's character says, he's not evil-he just wants food. It's hard to consider him a baddie when all he does is accidentally trash New York. Plus he moves and looks too much like the Jurassic Park T-Rex to be particularly impressive.None of the characters are interesting either. Which makes the 'character building' scenes completely useless. That time could have been put to much better use in this 140 minute long film. Only Jean Reno comes away with his dignity intact (can you believe he turned down playing Agent Smith to be in this?). Though it is cool to see Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria (Principal Skinner/Kent Brockman and Moe/Apu) in a movie together but they don't get much screen time.In comparison to ID4, Emmerich's direction kind of falls flat. Remember the public reactions as huge spaceships descended upon New York and LA and how everyone kind of watched in hypnotical awe as panic arose around them. The same could have been used in Godzilla but far too much of the movie has New Yorkers acting completely indifferently to a 1000 foot reptile hopping through the city. And I know those Apache helicopter scenes featuring the 'miniature' buildings are supposed to be an homage to the Japanese Godzilla flicks but here they look completely stupid and seem like they belong in a different movie. They just don't fit in with the rest of the film and it's very distracting. That could have been handled a lot better.The ending sets up story for two sequels which never happened because of massive audience disappointment. A shame kind of since Emmerich could have learned from his mistakes in this movie and made a sequel that is much better.I own the Superbit DVD of Godzilla (only available in Region 2 at the moment) and the DTS 5.1 sound is awesome. With every pounding footstep of the big lizard the living room booms and shakes. Plus the 2.40:1 anamorphic picture is flawless.",Godzilla
39,851222,Flawed but not bad guilty pleasure movie,7,23 January 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Godzilla"" (1998) is definitely not a bad guilty pleasure movie. It has pretty good special effects, nice pacing and some good action sequences involving Godzilla himself. Well its not entirely a Godzilla everyone knows, its more of a dinosaur but still its a good looking creature, especially when it interacts with environment (city buildings in this case). The downsides of this movie were pretty lame script at the moments, zero chemistry between Matthew Broderick and Maria Pitillo (and her poor performance as well) and just the look of this movie - literally almost all movie time action takes place at night, sure because its much more easier (and cheaper) to make all the big special effects sequences in a bloody dark, but not so much fun to watch it.Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a guilty pleasure. As a pure fun flick it does its job, nothing else and nothing more. A pure guilty pleasure.",Godzilla
40,tabuno,"Not Great, But Not As Bad As It's Been Described",7,21 March 2020,"Matthew Broderik and Jean Reno star in what in the industry is considered a ""bomb."" It cost a lot but didn't make much money. However, it would be unfair to consider this movie a bad movie. Instead one can view this English version of the relatively more cheesy 1950s Japanese ""Godzilla"" movies with Jurassic Park overtones as entertaining, blockbuster-like. It attempts along with Broderik's own wonderful personality to insert a fairly large dose of comic humor throughout the movie. Yet the balance between comedy, drama, and horror is more uneven than the best of these monster movies. There a bit more gore than the typical Jurassic Park movies, but not necessarily over the top considering how gory movies have become. There are also lapses in rational or logical chase scenes were Godzilla seems to speed away from helicopters but can't catch up to a speeding taxicab. The attempt to create a somewhat sympathetic monster is also intriguing though it wasn't completely successful in pulling it off. Overall, this is a feel-good action monster movie that could have been better, but it wasn't nearly as awful as the dollar numbers indicate.",Godzilla
41,The-Sarkologist,A monster smashes up New York,6,3 March 2012,"When one expects a movie to be poor and it is not then one is pleasantly surprised. Godzilla is not the epitome of intellectual movies. Actually there is very little in the way of intellectual discussion in this movie. Godzilla is a disaster movie, it is a movie about a giant lizard smashing up New York, and it is a remake of a much older movie using much less money.I enjoyed Godzilla though I have been told that it is not a movie to see a second time. It is nice watching a huge lizard smash up New York. It is nice watching him leap across the FDR expressway (I think) and tip huge boats everywhere. It is also nice watching the three heroes running around Madison Square Gardens being chased by hundreds of mini-Godzillas, but beyond that there is little to raise the movie beyond a cheap thrill.What is interesting is that in this movie we get to see the faces behind some of the characters in the Simpsons. We see Nacy Cartwright (the secretary in the scene where Godzilla walks past the window of the TV station), Hank Azira (the cameraman) and another guy whose name escapes me. Matthew Broderic is the star and Jean Reno plays a major role as a French spy.There is a tiny anti-nuclear power sentiment in this movie, though the science is probably not correct. There is an idea that intense radiation causes creature to mutate by growing, and Godzilla was exposed to the French nuclear testing and is really big. The original though was Japanese and probably dealt with the Hiroshima (I haven't seen it).",Godzilla

Boy was I disappointed. Don`t get ME wrong here,I loved the way Godzilla looked and infact I don`t think he could have looked better,his spines and and face was so awesome! But what I didn`t like about this film was how they used Godzilla. They made him out like an invader and shooting him for no reason and he turns about to be pregnant and not immortal like the the other Godzilla films. He looked to ME like a super hero and then turned on. The people who made this I think should have let someone else do it or not have done it at all. I was so sad when it ended and I couldn`t stop crying. I`M sorry but I just don`t like this movie like the TOHO movies.The bottom line is this: Great looking Godzilla,fantastic effects,but everything was just not used right.

44,poe426,Kaiju classic...,10,3 June 2013,"It took me quite some time to come to my senses, but I'd actually come to enjoy the terrors of Toho's GOJIRA movies- even the slow ones, wherein our hero gets very little screen time- when I was blown away by this version. Gone were the low-budget, cheesy effects I'd come to expect from a kaiju movie: everything was slick (and no doubt expensive), from the cinematography and fx to the music and performances. The original GOJIRA addressed some serious issues (like the effects of atomic radiation) and the 1998 GODZILLA made it all too clear that some of those 1950s issues are STILL serious issues. In terms of filmmaking, GODZILLA, more than any previous giant monster movie, gave the title character the gravitas he deserved: one actually FELT that this was a giant creature stomping through a modern day metropolis; it was handled realistically and logically and I was so impressed by it that I went back and saw it a second time on The Big Screen. (The live-action GIGANTOR and the first two JURRASIC PARK entries are the only other giant-on-the-loose movies that I can recall that gave one the impression that the giants were REAL.) GODZILLA may have lost some of his charm, but he gained credibility.",Godzilla
45,filipemanuelneto,A monstrous monster movie.,3,2 March 2020,"Roland Emmerich must be the director most feared by New Yorkers, as their city is almost always devastated in his films. This happened in ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""Independence Day"" and ""2012"", as it happens throughout this film, which is basically about the attack that a gigantic marine lizard decides to do against New York.The plot is all a little too imaginative and there are a lot of things that don't make sense. For example, it is unlikely that radiation from atomic tests would have caused a normal lizard to grow to the size of a skyscraper, and even more difficult to parallel this with an abnormal growth of a few inches in the Chernobyl earthworms (unless some of them have become the creatures we see in ""Tremors"", another film about grown monsters). The arrival in New York brings more stupid things: the monster shrinks and increases to the taste and needs of the film, the military are totally made of fools and humiliated at all times and who saves the day is a nerdy scientist with an unpronounceable name and a French military spy who likes to make stupid jokes at the most inappropriate times. The end is just as bad and strange, and the creature's very appearance is quite strange, looking like a weird dinosaur.The cast is full of well-known names, like Matthew Broderick (very competent in comedy, but totally wasted and strange here) Maria Pitillo makes a walking caricature, and the whole cast seems little interested in doing something good. French actor Jean Reno, in the most forgettable non-French speaking role in his filmography, gives us the best interpretation, which is to say a lot about the film.The film still has a serious problem with rhythm, with huge sections where nothing happens and that just take up space and make the film longer than necessary. To add to that, the bad visual, special and sound effects and liters of bad CGI, fake at first glance, boring and without anything impressive. The soundtrack is great, but it is meaningless in such a hollow film and ends up sounding too presumptuous.This is definitely a monstrous monster movie.",Godzilla
46,pmtelefon,Not great but better than I remembered,7,24 May 2020,"""Godzilla"" is a great example of a big budget summer movie that doesn't really work. It plays by the big summer movie rules but it misses the mark. The first half of ""Godzilla"" is very good. But after an hour or so, the story takes a wrong turn.

48,insomniac_rod,Disaster movie in all the sense of the word.,5,23 November 2008,"When I think about this movie, the first word that comes to my mind is disaster. Why? Not because of the events caused by Godzilla, not because the destruction of the City; but because of the messed caused by the script and the typical Hollywoodesque situations.Overall, the plot is not that bad but it's poorly executed. To make this worse, the action is fast paced but not that spectacular like say, ""Independence Day"" or ""Men In Black"". We don't care about the characters or their sub-plots, we only care about good old Godzilla who happens to have minimal on-screen time and never manages to make a decent appearance.The important situation is that the movie is visually stunning and is held by memorable sequences (the eye for example). Plus there were many interesting things behind the movie: the MTV support that always helps a movie to be successful, the Puff Daddy ""Come With Me"" song (poor Jimmy Page), and of course the monster itself.I would only recommend this movie if it airs on Sunday morning or when you don't have anything else to do. Overall, a mediocre disaster or monster movie that didn't have economic success because it never defined where it tried to go.",Godzilla

This movie is about Godzilla. A big lizard, basically. After atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific, Godzilla makes it's way through the Panama Canal. They call a scientist in, Niko Tatopolous, to help investigate what the creature is. They figure that the giant lizard was created by the atomic bomb testing. Who knew?

Everyone, including the combined U.S. military, must come together to try and figure out a way to eliminate the unusually large reptile.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10: Great.",Godzilla
50,FiendishDramaturgy,It's the attack of Jurassiczilla!!!,9,20 October 2003,"This is a very good movie. But the name ""Godzilla"" should have never been attached to it. As a monster flick it is quite good. But this is NOT the Godzilla I love.I'm going to try to be fair here. I LOVE the hokey old campy ""Godzilla"" monster movies of the 50's and the 60's...the 70's and the 80's even. And the idea of Godzilla being an irradiated iguana is preposterous. That not withstanding, this is still a good production; highly entertaining; and creatively directed, enacted and presented.Matthew Broderick is wonderful in his role as Dr. Niko ""The Worm Guy"" Tatopoulos (Project X, Ferris Beuler's Day Off, Election, etc). I've never been much of a fan of his work because I've never been able to identify with his characters. And I thought he REEKED in ""Inspector Gadget,"" but to his credit, that was more the fault of the direction and a really stupid script, than his.Maria Pitillo (Olivia Honey of Roseanne Barr's ""She-Devil"") demonstrated her best talents in my opinion; the best of her career. (For my review of She-Devil, please click my name and then click the corresponding link.) After a long string of obscure titles, this vehicle gave her a chance to show her true abilities. Her portrayal of Audrey Timmonds is open and appears genuine. She makes you care what happens to her character. That is the start of a good performance. But she never loses that open quality which makes you feel as if you know the character as a person. That is the mark of a great performance; such as the one with which she presents to the viewer in this production.Although the scene in which Dr. Tatopolous finds himself standing inside the footprint of Godzilla was directly ripped off from the '76 remake of ""King Kong,"" the rest of the movie was quite creatively done; written, directed, filmed and presented. I had a lot of fun with this movie, by ignoring the constant references to Godzilla, itself. The ""monster"" featured in this film is NOT Godzilla, but rather some ""Jurassic Park"" rip-off of Godzilla. I can enjoy the movie for what it is, rather than what it is supposed to be. What it is supposed to be is a modernized remake of a classic monster/horror movie. What it is, is a top quality monster movie which bears NO resemblance whatsoever to the original.PLOT: ""Godzilla"" is a colossal irradiated iguana who has come to NYC. The US Army, Corps of Engineers, and a band of French nationals know that ""Godzilla"" has found a home in the sewers of NYC, but have no idea where. After bombing and blowing up several buildings (the Chrysler Building, for one...""Negative impact?! That's the Chrysler Building we're talking about here!"" Mayor of New York City), they finally decide to listen to their hi-jacked expert, Dr. Nico Tatopoulos, and allow him to bait the monster to lure it out into the open. Well, that works, but not as planned. (Do their plans EVER work right? lol) So now, Dr. Tatopoulos, his ex girlfriend (a would-be reporter), and the leader of the French Secret Service unit sent here to monitor and intervene in the capture of the monster, must go down into the sewers to find this elusive terror. Dr. Tatopoulos determines through scientific methodologies and just good old fashioned horse sense, that the monster is in NYC to find a breeding ground for his/its(?) brood of world-dominating spawn. It seems that it reproduces asexually and therefore needs no mate. ""What's the fun in that?"" Audrey Timmonds. But when they discover that our little ""friend"" has not only been busy, but very Very busy, in its egg-laying capacity, no one will listen to Nico's insistent pleadings to destroy the building in which the eggs reside, and it is up to our hero to save the day.Excellent monster movie, if you can just ignore the obvious and constant ""Godzilla"" references. Horrid, atrocious, blasphemy of a remake in the field of ""Godzilla"" movies.As a Godzilla movie, it rates a 1.2/10.As a monster movie, it rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Godzilla
51,elshikh4,Who said that this is a bad movie ?!,8,12 November 2011,"After a recommendation from a friend, I went to watch it on 11 / 8 / 1998. The theater's huge screen was replaced by a multiplex. I convinced myself to endure one of the new, very small, screens. Then, I sat at the last raw, which is something I regretted, since I discovered that the ancient, almost tumbledown, projection was on in a room right beside me, and what an appalling noise it was producing!Though, I savored this movie to the max. It's utterly fun. It has wonderful action sequences (the taxi's chase is epic), lovely comic atmosphere, non-stop thrill (the eggs' sequence still blows my mind), sedate editing, splendid music and impressive special effects. Maybe it missed more bankable stars, but the movie's cast managed to do well. Nobody was bad in any way. The team of rescue at the end was so funny and impeccable. Jean Reno, in specific, stole the show with memorable wit and charisma. The side characters were funny and interesting too. And I loved a line: ""Time changes. / Some people don't!"" which is so rare to happen in a disaster movie!It's, as a whole, an expensive comics, done so rightly. If something was possibly bad; then it could be about how the monster was kind when it came to killing. But this is PG-13 after all, and for my taste I love the no bloody movies. So you can predict my surprise when I heard after the viewing that the movie was hated in its homeland, cursed by critics, and nominated for 5 Razzie awards!!!That was a shock. Especially when I knew that it already made good deal of money, locally and internationally! I asked myself: were all the viewers in America drunk?! Maybe it's different than the original Asian Godzilla? Maybe they didn't like Matthew Broderick in an action? Or maybe they needed any laughingstock of a movie for that year?It won the Worst Supporting Actress, and the Worst Remake or Sequel. While feeling a massive rage, since the lovely Maria Pitillo wasn't close to ""awful"" or ""not good"" in no case, and the poor thing didn't get to be in movies again, I feel more rage when many perfectly Razzie material in 1998 didn't even get nominated under any category. Remember these and weep: Free Money, The Godson, Senseless, Hurlyburly, Crazy Six, Krippendorf's Tribe, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Phoenix, The General, The Naked Man, and yes The Thin Red Line. Actually, with that, unfairness hits a super level!Roger Ebert smashed the movie (he was parodied somehow through the character of the mayor). He saw it as bad disaster movie, giving it the famous thumb down, while - in 1999 - he gave something named (Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace), a positive review?? AHHHHHHHHHH!!! The lesson to be learned here is: while searching for a laughingstock, some reviewers turn into one themselves!I give Godzilla A-Plus as huge B entertainment. It will go down in history as one of the most wronged movies ever. Enough to say that it made me forget the projection's appalling noise one time, and makes me forget the critics' more appalling stupidity every time.",Godzilla
52,jamesrupert2014,Godzilla in New York,7,28 January 2018,"Many Godzilla purists rejected this CGI-based reinterpretation of the story (#23 in the series) but it is not a bad kaiju outing in its own right. The Toho release (Godzilla vs. Destoroyah, 1995) preceding Emmerich's version continued the trend toward improbable monsters, new-age subplots, and self-righteous greenery and I found the US version to be a refreshing return to the original concept: humanity vs. a single, destructive monster born of radiation. Typical of Emmerich's unsubtle style, everything is very big (Godzilla) or very numerous (e.g. helicopters) and the human drama of the 1954 original, which treats the monster's destructive rampage more as a tragedy than an adventure, is replaced by light-weight shtick, primarily revolving around the Roger Ebert-lookalike mayor (apparently an Emmerich in-joke). Godzilla itself is (IMO) quite well done with a very different look from the original (reflecting 'iguana' rather than 'dinosaur' origins) and the production has fun with the sheer scale of the monster. The opening credit scenes, which establish Godzilla's genesis, are extremely good and the film builds well from there to the arrival of the monster on the shores of Manhattan Island. The cast is fine: Mathew Broderick's playing the scientist who seems to always guess correctly and Maria Pitillo and Hank Azaria as intrepid reporters (both tropes familiar to anyone who has watched the Japanese films). Jean Reno is great as the French secret-service agent trying to ensure that the role France's nuclear tests in creating the current disaster remains unknown and he (and his team) have best lines in the film, riffing on both Gallic unflappability and the challenges of running a clandestine operation in America. Within the context of the film, a general plausibility is maintained (other than reconciling Godzilla's size and its ability to fit in the New York subway system) until the 'third act', an overdone and ridiculous chase scene that is by far the weakest part of the film. Future Japanese entries in the Godzilla franchise make the occasional amusing dig at Emmerich's fish-eating version of the iconic kaiju, but overall, I thought that the film (the 23 outing for the big guy) was was a worthy effort at 'Americanising' Toho's famous monster and liked the film more than most viewers (based on IMDB) and certainly more than most Godzilla-philes.",Godzilla
53,ebiros2,This is not Godzilla,2,12 October 2005,"This movie could have been good. It could have had a real Godzilla in it with the budget and realism seen only in a good Hollywood movie. But no, for some reason the producers decided to blow up an iguana to Godzilla size and call it Godzilla. Why they did this is just beyond anybody's comprehension. But I guess same thing did happen to Catwoman, and few other icons that made a translation from other medium to the big screen. But this was especially bad because it was a big screen to big screen translation.Godzilla is supposed to be invincible. Not die with mere missile fires from F-16. Such weakling does not deserve to be called Godzilla even if it looked like Godzilla (which in this case didn't).Casting was (uh) bad. Story was confusing with so many characters crossing paths but didn't contribute in making the plot better. This includes the baby monster iguanas too.I'd like to see the real Hollywood Godzilla. Done like the ""Last Samurai"" which would make the original pale. Anyone up for the challenge ?",Godzilla
54,dee.reid,The hype is gone now...,6,15 April 2002,"I've been a huge fan of Godzilla since as far back as I can remember.  I remember that every Saturday I would go to the Blockbuster Video and rent ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" or otherwise known as ""Godzilla on Monster Island"". It was my favorite Godzilla movie for numerous reasons.  Along side that, I also rented ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"", ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"", ""Godzilla 1985"", and ""Godzilla vs. Biollante"".  After that, as the Internet was growing increasing popular and easier to use (this was just about four years ago), I would often go to different web sites and basically catalog anything I could get about Godzilla and every single other monster that the ""Big Guy"" has ever been affiliated with.  Then, during one of my usual cataloging sessions, I somehow came across an advertisement for the new Americanized version of ""Godzilla"".  I automatically knew that this was going to be good.  I also knew that since this was coming from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin whose two previous films ""Universal Soldier"" and ""Independence Day"" I was a fan of.  The movie was also going to star Matthew Broderick, who I had been a very big fan of since ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".  Anyway, I eagerly waited for that special day (May 19, 1998) to come. Finally, the big day came and I went to see it.  Boy I was blown away by this masterpiece.  It had everything I expected from it: action, more action, and the brand new ""Godzilla"".  I came out of that movie theater a very proud customer.  During this films run at the movie theaters, I saw ""Godzilla"" a total of six times, each time getting better and better. Also during this time, I grabbed up every single piece of literature about the movie as I could get as well as the films soundtrack, which featured music from P. Diddy (who people need to just back up off of) and The Wallflowers. I even bought the action figures (only the Godzilla and his offspring, forgot the human action figures).  Then I patiently waited for the VHS to be released.  That day came and I got the VHS.  It was just as good as it was in the theater.But that was then (1998) and this is now (2002).  That is four long years and believe me, a lot happened during this timeI've recently and very carefully looked back at those years (1990-1998) and I wonder, ""what happened?""  You must also remember that this is coming from a DIE HARD Godzilla fan.  Ever since all the hype from this movie died, I feel so did a piece of my childhood (I'm only 16).  I've been reading some of the bad and good things about this film and I feel that I agree with some of them.  My readings have brought me to several of the following conclusions about this movie.  My first realization is how Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have tarnished the Godzilla name.  Godzilla has been one of the best things to ever happen to western audiences during the 1950s through the 1990s.  Despite the hilariously bad dubbing and some corny story lines, somewhere inside, there was a lot of fun to be had and some serious topics to be discussed.  Since 1954, Godzilla has basically become an icon and has stood as a testament to the post-World War II era in which nuclear testing on Pacific islands was very common.  Godzilla himself, who is a product of nuclear testing, has stood as a symbol and as a constant reminder of man's tinkering with things that should not be tinkered with.  Godzilla is a menace plain and simple, but somewhere in the mayhem, we saw a truly tragic creature that was only doing what it could to survive simply because of man's carelessness.  This explains why Godzilla acted so fiercely towards newcomers such as King Ghidorah or Mechagodzilla, because he was defending his home.  This brings me to the ""new"" Godzilla, which in the movie is nothing more than just a big lizard who eats a lot of fish.  I heard that in an interview with Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, that they had attempted (and with very poor results) to make this Godzilla more like ""animalized"". This basically means that they had tried to make Godzilla seem like the animal he is: a lizard.  This Godzilla only defended himself when he felt threatened, ran at the sight of the army instead of stomping them down, was vulnerable to attack (the original wasn't), and lastly, what the hell happened to his atomic blast?  Oh yeah, it was the fire.  The biggest difference between the two Godzillas was the whole with thing with reproduction.  The old Godzilla had only one child, while this Godzilla laid eggs.  What the hell?  I've heard a lot of people pan this, saying that the baby Godzillas look a lot like the raptors from ""Jurassic Park"".My second realization was the somewhat questionable casting.  Matthew Broderick is arguably an obvious choice for this film.  Even with his somewhat geeky looks, he does have the wit and charm of someone who could play a scientist.  Jean Reno plays a French mercenary who is on assignment in New York, who is there to clean up his country?s ""mistakes"", that being Godzilla and his offspring.  Jean Reno is good as a hit man like in the ""The Professional"" but not as a mercenary whose only role in this movie is to serve, as someone Matthew Broderick's character has to look to for help. Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer, who both regularly play characters on the animated show, ""The Simpsons"", are good as the cameraman and sleazy news anchor.  My biggest problem with the both of them is that they aren't given a lot to work with in this movie.  Hank Azaria seems only here as a little comic relief and Harry Shearer is only here as someone to laugh at when he gets told by Maria Pitillo's character.""Godzilla"" is really at best, failed potential.  In the hands of another action director like John Woo or someone around those lines, then maybe this movie may not have turned out to be something so bad.  I mean, I really used to like this movie, but I question the motives behind it.  Aside from all the recently discovered faults that I've found with this movie, I still give it a six out of ten for providing me with the entertainment that I found necessary to satisfy my interests in Godzilla.I still reflect on those days when Godzilla was my idol, my only escape from reality, and the only thing that primarily interested me.  I really hate to say it, but this movie unfortunately did it for me.  But, despite my newfound un-interest in Godzilla, I still have all of the information and collectibles that I gathered over the years and I occasionally look at them.",Godzilla

I found this movie also had some very dark humor and lots stuff was happens in the movie and it's not just about Godzilla. I thought the Godzilla who looked Great and found whole movie very fast paced, I never get boring at all. The acting was really good from the whole cast. it's shame about open ending, I heard this was meant 2 other movies in the series, As this got panned, axed the other 2 sequel.

56,iquine,America's First Take On Godzilla,6,5 June 2020,"(Flash Review)Starting off relatively well, this turns into Jurassic Park as it felt like a dinosaur chase movie rather than focused on the mythical Godzilla. This new Godzilla also doesn't hold true to many of the original's traits such as what it eats and how it can be killed. Now on American soil of course Godzilla ravages Manhattan while the military try to take him down as they create a ton of (needless) damage. The media desperately looking for the inside scoop also create their own damage by stirring mass hysteria. One special scientist learns Godzilla is pregnant and warns that it's nest of eggs must be found to avoid hatching more of these beasts. As expected, this is full of explosions, destruction, roars, human ineptitude, light romance and heroics. Your typical Hollywood CGI fluff action monster movie with some notable plot holes.",Godzilla
57,Foreverisacastironmess123,Oh I can't stand it...,5,25 June 2014,"This film's a bit of a paradox, on the one hand it does have its awesome moments and is frequently thrilling and entertaining, but it is also so damn dull! And some of the characters were impossibly annoying! ""Not anymore Chuck, I quit!"" Gah, that bitch thoroughly deserved to get her Razzi! I was never able to sit through it without fast-winding.. To me, it was stunning how badly they misjudged the material. After how terrifically Roland Emmerich staged mass destruction in Independence Day, I was really excited to see what he could do with Godzilla. But, yeah.. What a wasted opportunity. Did anyone in the audience ever walk out thinking that wait a minute, hadn't they already seen the same thing done elsewhere, like in Jurassic Park, not to mention done better? At the climactic seen where Godzilla's on top of the Brooklyn Bridge and he's hit by the missiles which knock him off the bridge and kill him - Even as a kid I thought: what, that's it? That's all it takes to kill him? It didn't take a fan to recognize that this was just plain anticlimactic, like someone pulling out a gun to shoot the bad guy in the finale of a martial arts film. I will say though that I thought the follow-up animated series that they did was not too bad at all. They kept a loose continuity with the feature film, and despite being unable to use any of Toho's famous monster characters, did a decent job of making an interesting set of stories from week to week. One time they even had him up against Quetzalcoatel! They at least had the smarts to make Godzilla a bit more powerful and aggressive, edging him closer to what the original Japanese series embodies. Sigh, I might have liked this picture a lot more if it had been called something other than Godzilla(!) At best, it's a below average monster-on-the-loose film, one that rips off a true classic I might add: Q the Winged Serpent, a film which unlike this one, is not soulless. Aside from the title of the movie, it has nothing to do with Godzilla. I mean of course they should have tried to do their own thing and in their own way, but if you are going to call it Godzilla, then you should at least retain some basis of the original character. That was their fatal flaw - they discarded *everything* except the name. Instead of a somewhat invulnerable dinosaur-like creature with dorsal fins, aggressive and destructive nature, that's equipped with his signature atomic breath and distinctive roar, and a symbol of the nuclear threat, they gave us a radiation-mutated lizard with no special ability who runs from conflict and destroys things by accident. In the end he is easily killed by a single volley of conventional weaponry. There's no discernible subtext to this turkey other than ""let's make money!!!""",Godzilla
58,kluseba,"""Americanisation"" and ""blockbustering"" of a Japanese legend",4,5 April 2010,"I am a huge fan of Godzilla since my early childhood. If read many books, played many games, collected many cards or little figures or whatever and watched many Japanese movies about this legacy...And then, I watched this American remake. They should have never touched this Japanese legend...The charm of the Japanese movies with people wearing the costumes, artificial miniature cities created brick by brick in long hours to get destroyed during one scene by a giant guy in a latex costume, the appearance of so many funny monsters, aliens or armies, the political, social, environmental or simply anti-war context of several movies... all of those things are not present in this movie. The few characters are kind of superficial, the most important scenes are entirely created on the computer and Godzilla doesn't look like the original one, but rather like a silly rip-off from the ""Alien"" movies. Everything that made the Japanese movies special and interesting is missing in this movie. That's why, even though most of the actors had signed for two sequels, there has not been a second American movie about Godzilla - thanks! The only thing this movie was good for was the fact that it brought the legendary Japanese monster to a larger public. And it was good to see an entertaining action movie (if we forget about the Japanese context) with some ice effects in the cinema - but nothing more.",Godzilla

60,peterp-450-298716,Damn irritating actors ...,4,21 January 2014,"Because of the new release of Godzilla this year, and I'm looking forward to that, I watched this old blockbuster of 1998 once again. Well, it's obviously an old movie in terms of CGI and the acting is sometimes hugely annoying and childish. Compared to the new movie this year it really looks miserable sometimes . On the other hand, I can still remember the original Godzilla movies I saw when I was young in an old movie theater on a Sunday afternoon . There always was some Bruce Lee movie programmed in conjunction with a Japanese Godzilla (vs. King Kong ) or a Bud Spencer/Terence Hill movie . The Japanese Godzilla was hilarious . It looked like a plastic figure between cardboard boxes with some terribly bad special effects . By comparison, this Godzilla is state-of-the-art .Lets have a look at Godzilla first. At times the images are quite good like for instance the underwater images. In most of the movie, we only see parts of Godzilla: a leg that is put down on some stationary taxis, a swishing tail or only his head. Not exactly high technology. What bothered me the most is the fact that the thump of the drop of a foot followed with the subsequently shock wave is not properly synced with the bounce of people and cars . I thought this happens with a bit delay. The fact that New York is turned into a ruin is one thing. The fact that the army is the main cause of this instead of Godzilla is another thing. It's totally ridiculous. And sometimes I had the feeling that the decor was also made of cardboard boxes .The most irritating thing in Godzilla, are the stupid and terrible performances . I think Mathew Broderick is totally misplaced in this monster movie. I can tolerate him in a comedy like ""She's having a baby"", ""Addicted to Love"" or ""Inspector Gadget "", but not in this disaster movie . Or they used him to pump up the comedy-rate. His name Tatopoulus is already a reason to make some hilarious (sarcastic) jokes. All the time he runs around through the rain with that ridiculous hat and every time he says something it sounds implausible and totally made up .Maria Pitillo looks like an angel but is corny and predictable. She's the blonde bimbo in the news department who's not allowed to bring important news. Eventually she's steals some footage on a tape and makes her own reportage. Her boss uses that for his own benefit but eventually she triumphs with a report at the end. She also appears to be an old sweetheart from Broderick. What a coincidence ! Hank Azaria was actually the best actor. A nice guy at the right time to use the camera for exclusive images. Kind of weird that every time something like that happens, the camera doesn't function properly. Then there are some more irritating people, such as: Kevin Dunn as a pedantic and clamorous Colonel, Michael Lerner as a stupid and thick mayor, Arabella Field as a friend of Animal who apparently doesn't know a cameraman sometimes experiences dangerous situations. Her reaction is almost hysterical all the time. Then there's Vicki Lewis the horny science woman who, despite the apocalyptic situation, still has time to start drooling whenever she looks at Broderick. And last but not least, Doug Savant as the most stupid soldier of the U.S. Army . The PeeWee Herman of the American army .You shouldn't assume that this movie is accurate and realistic. If you seek that in a movie, go watch ""The Butler"". But there are still quite a few things that look ridiculous . That Godzilla was created by radioactive radiation by nuclear tests in French Polynesia, is actually a variant of the original film . Why that animal must swim all the way to Manhattan to lay her eggs, is a mystery to me. He/she swims from the Pacific Ocean through the Panama Canal, along Florida and then straight to New York . Is he/she making a tourist trip ? The pilots who control the helicopters apparently never had to do an IQ test. They are chased by Godzilla, look over their shoulders in a panic , knowing that if they just flew that thing straight up they would be safe . I also think their index finger got stuck with super glue to the firing mechanism , because they kept spraying bullets continuously even when there was nothing in their sight. And could they ever miss Godzilla ? Such a huge animal . Dr. Tatopoulus is a renowned researcher in the field of animal mutation by radiation. At the time he presents this as proof that Godzilla might be actually a mutant lizard ,everyone declared him as a total nutcase and crazy fruitcake. Why did they call upon him in the first place ?The end was somewhat entertaining with the ""Jurasic Park""-like baby Godzillas . But overall it was a disappointment. ""Godzilla"" had no such effect as let's say ""Jaws "" or ""King Kong"". Those movies gave you an anxious feeling. As someone suggested on IMDb : you purchase a lifelike Iguana as a pet, place it in the middle of the living room between some Lego houses , and observe how it moves and destroys everything . This can also be nerve-wracking and exciting.",Godzilla
61,adamjohns-42575,Ferris Bueler's Day At Work!,4,21 April 2021,"So back in the days when Matthew Broderick was still cute and before CGI took over completely, they made this film which wasn't entirely done in front of a blue screen and I think it's a relative success. It's a ""Type"" of film that up until now I have only ever seen bits of, but enough to cobble together what was going on. That's what makes it work for me, the fact that you don't need to pay a huge amount of attention, but you are rewarded with some great scenes of a monster terrorising New York when you do look at the screen or come back from the kitchen. Would we call him a monster? I think that's a bit harsh actually and according to this film he is, what we as a people, have made him. I don't think he does it deliberately.Having now watched it all the way through, it makes even more sense and I would be happy to tune in again. It is a much more accessible 'Godzilla' than the 2014 version, even though my husband Aaron Taylor Johnson is in that one.The only thing that I think really complicates issues here is that there are so many characters involved. I think that they could have made the same film without at least the Mayor, Harry Shearer's news anchor and Hank Azaria (A severely underrated actor), the cameraman's wife and still achieved the same results.It's not that it's overly long because of it, but it does get very busy on the screen at times.The CGI and the animatronics work well together. I'm actually more of a fan of models and people in rubber masks or make up than I am of CGI anyway, but I understand how much better films are because of it now.It's not an offensive film and it doesn't raise political questions and it's not trying to get a message across, but it's fun and simple to follow.",Godzilla

Talk about a boatload of questions in need of an answer. This entire movie is a major stumper, making me wonder how such crap can come from the mind of a human being. Seriously, the old school Godzilla movies at least had some camp value because of the strings and miniature sets, but this proved to be a big waste of time. How the heck do you lose a 300-foot reptile in Manhattan? That's a question I still want answered. Clearly, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin must have been getting sick of Hollywood or something because they actually thought this film was a good idea. Now the pair have to build themselves back up after making two great films in Stargate and Independence Day.",Godzilla

It had such great marketing too, I remember the Taco Bell dog quipping off the giant gecko, I remember getting a drink holder shaped like the lizard's claw, the toys were everywhere... It was fun!Oh how things have changed.This movie is bad. It's flirting with ""so bad it's good"" territory but no, it's just bad. The lizard looks ridiculous now, the performances are awful almost all around, save for Reno and Azaria. The comedy is just stupid and the movie makes no sense as it desperately claws for every bit of low hanging fruit it can get at. The movie is flat out stupid at numerous points, but it takes itself so seriously.Azaria is enjoyable and Reno is doing the best he can to turn garbage into gold. They are the only positives here beyond the occasional dumb joke that does manage to hit that ""so bad it's good"" spot but they are free and far between.Can't really recommend this for anyone.

65,truemythmedia,Watch out! It's Roland Emmerich!,4,20 May 2019,"This movie is pretty bad, but compared to Emmerich's other films, I'd actually say its one of the better ones, which, again, isn't saying much (note the Two Star rating).
Emmerich is a man who loooooves his special effects. He is the poor man's Michael Bay, in my opinion. His movies pander to the lowest common denominator; the brainless masses that flock like zombies from a George Romero movie to see the latest wave of special effects-driven destruction. Look at almost all of Emmerich's films, and they all have one thing in common: the cool sequences of destruction are far more important than the characters, their motivations, or a coherent plot. There is a market for movies like this, and I was part of that market 20 years ago (no longer, thank God). This is a movie aimed at teenage and preteen boys; it never tries to rise above that intelligence level.
Side Note: I found it incredibly amusing that Emmerich decided to have the NYC Mayor be a caricature of Roger Ebert and the mayor's assistant, a caricature of Gene Siskel, a ridiculous jab that Ebert himself commented on when reviewing this film.",Godzilla

I didn't like him in either.But, I watched this for another chance to see Jean Reno. He was as great here as in Ronin, and funny, too. I have to admit that Michael Lerner was funny as the Mayor, as was Kevin Dunn as Colonel Hicks. Maria Pitillo (Natural Born Killers) was cute as Audrey.The special effects were OK, but those chopper pilots should get some training from Tommy Lee Jones (Fire Birds).Time would better spent watch one of the Japanese Godzilla films.",Godzilla
67,Kamurai25,I think I'm just not a Kaiju fan,4,7 July 2020,"Not a good watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend, unless you're just a Kaiju fan, which I am not.I have a noted bias for liking stories of shrinking down, or involving small people (like 6 inch people), and not liking ""big"" character stories (BFG, Godzilla, Pacific Rim, Cloverfield (probably the best for me, but I like found footage). Something about being too big to fit into society, not being able to hide / get away, being accidently destructive just has zero appeal to me.I do respect the genre, and in some ways....maybe more than the people that made this movie. Godzilla is supposed to be the main character, whether it's a ""villain"" or ""hero"", and America has trouble understanding that sometimes so they turned Godzilla into a force of nature that nested in.....one of the New York islands and had it make babies as additional antagonists. This allows for late 1990's CG work, with the Jurassic Park reject practical effects being one of the best things about this movie.There just isn't a lot of tension as Godzilla wrecks New York, maybe there is some with the babies, but really you're just supposed to ooh and awe at the effects for way too long until you realize you don't care, and by then they're supposed to have something else to dangle in front of you.Think of it as ""shifting the goalposts"", but with focus, while nothing of any real meaning happens. The most touching part of the movie was at the end, which was just confusing, because we should have felt triumphant and not sad, the movie fails to lead our emotions in that regard.No idea why Matthew Broderick touched this one, he must have always wanted it and go to live out a dream. He was, by far, the most famous person there, with Jean Reno behind him.Maybe I'm just not a fan, but there just isn't enough action / effects to make me like this one.",Godzilla
68,eric262003,"Over-Hyped,Overblown and Overrated",5,21 September 2015,"An overwhelming, series of brightly inflated lights takes over the skies where a nuclear bomb is being tested in French Polynesia is being examined. Moments later, the Pacific ocean is churning as a freighter is moving at a very rapid rate. Giant footprints have been spotted around the South Pacific beaches and rainforests. American coastal ships have been wrecked as they were twirling into a rolling sea with no logical explanation. The carnage then manifests all the way to Manhattan, New York (big surprise?)where the culprit centres around a giant dinosaur-like creature bigger than a Spinosaurus ruthlessly destroys the city leaving it near rubble as panic and fear comes into full effect. A scientist Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), an ambitious TV journalist Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo), her cameraperson Animal Pilotti (Hank Azaria) and a French insurance investigator (Jean Reno) where an unorthodox camaraderie comes into fruition. Despite their working agendas and contrasting ways to go about it, they join forces to defeat this beast before her babies hatch before its too late. Back in 1998, everyone's favourite super-dinosaur who has terrorized audiences for over 60 years had returned to the big screen stomping on vehicles, destroying tall buildings, and breathing fire from its mouth. In this 1998 adaptation, more so than the 2014 remake, ""Godzilla"" was the most hyped summer blockbuster at the time. But the final product resulted in nothing more than an overdone, overrated abomination. It just lacked in excitement, thrills or even exposure to the massive beast, which was what I was expecting. Back in the 1950's when Godzilla was wrecking havoc in Japan, the stories focusing on the monster was often intense, though campy, with cheesy archaic technical effects, but did reflect a true phobia and distrust at the time when science and nuclear war was becoming a threat. However, the 1998 version, is contrary to the intentions that the Japanese versions had. Okay the technical features improved tremendously, but the fear factor was not very effective. Godzilla in the more modern day feels not well needed and has no symbolic references in our less than paranoid world than in years before. Directed by Roland Emmerich (who also directed ""Independence Day"") made ""Godzilla"" to cater towards the audience into making him a spectacle rather than to implement a significant story behind the beast and its destructive nature. The monster just plows his way across the Pacific towards New York City where all modern day giant beasts make their homes to proves themselves formidable. The main thing wrong here is that the monster's screen time seems to be at only thirty minutes long. That's quite a record low. The unleashing of the monster is to be blamed towards nuclear testing. When the opening credits come into fruition as iguanas are staring at a giant mushroom-shaped cloud is coming down. Radiation has a lasting effect on these lizards and before you know it, Godzilla materializes standing over 100 feet tall, leaving massive footprints and demolishing fishing boats.Matthew Broderick is Dr. Tatopoulos a nerdy kind scientist who was brought into the mix while his ex-girlfriend, TV journalist Audrey Timmonds who has ambitions of being promoted news anchor and coverage of Godzilla's destruction is her ticket to that position. Let's just say the apocalypse of the modern day world is just another shoe in for career opportunities. Once again Matthew Brodrick is playing the same character he's played all his career. Maria Pitillo fared better and was adorable, it's too bad she knew it herself. The real stand-out performer comes from Jean Reno was the French secret agent. With his panicked eyes and his pock-marked complexion and his harried expressions, he was the sole character other than the giant lizard that held my interest. He scoffs at awful the coffee the New Yorkers make and when impersonating Elvis in front of American soldiers. The missing ingredient that would have made ""Godzilla"" better was some tongue-in-cheek humour which Emmerich used in ""Independence Day"" that he neglected here. As it stands, ""Godzilla"" falls flat by simply lacking in wit. Michael Lerner can pass off as the most loudest, annoying political leader as Mayor Ebert, as he bears a stunning resemblance to film critic Roger Ebert. Oh what a coincidence, his partner is a balding man named Gene. How funny is that?The only thrilling moments often feels recycled from ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" only exception, those two movies executed it far better. The monster's features are only shown waist down crushing cars and demolishing cars with his powerful tail. Meanwhile at Madison Square Garden, little Godzillas wreck havoc against feared bystanders that once again steal pages from Spielberg with the velociraptors. Fifth Avenue was in rubble, Chrysler Building is crushed and the Brooklyn Bridge is now eradicated, by end the end of the destruction that may cost trillions of dollars in damages. The beast is never good or evil. He's just an animal, a gigantic, loud shallow beast with reboots, remakes and sequels in the future, his reputation's slowly becoming extinct.",Godzilla
69,winner55,time waster,1,16 October 2006,"There are only two good things in this film, Jean Reno as the French spy, and the editing, which keeps the film moving even when the screenplay clearly does not. For these two reasons alone, it might be worth wasting some time on this, but surely for nothing else.Here are some of the bad qualities of this mess: BAD science: it is physically impossible for this lizard to have laid 200 eggs in two days.BAD history: The French are brought in to hide the fact that it was the US that did most of the nuclear testing in the Pacific.BAD politics: In a State of Emergency military response HQ, the mayor would never be present - he has no authority in such a situation; so why do the soldiers here even tolerate him? BAD story construction: Only a couple missiles to kill off a monster, but two similarly explosive torpedoes can't do the job? And how did the lizard get from Guam to NYC without any further notice - in a single day, apparently. And why? We all know Toho's Godzilla's grudge against Japan, but it's senseless for GINO to swim thousands of miles, just to sleep in a NYC subway.BAD characters: The hero is boringly monotone, in appearance as in speech; the hero's girlfriend is a real bitch and deserved stepping on - why then bring the two of them back together? Are they sadomasochists as well? BAD special effects: The color values of the skin of the big reptiles never change, despite radical variance in tone, amount, and direction of the environmental lighting of any scene. A godzillion dollars on special effects, and they make such a serious goof?! Of course these critters are phony - they look pasted on the screen.BAD in-jokes: The Siskel and Ebert gag was amusing for precisely 10 seconds - unfortunately it was repeated through-out the film. And it is overtly insulting to two critics who deserved our respect, no matter how we disagreed with them.BAD performances: Is Matthew Broderick's face capable of more than one expression? If so, I've never seen it.BAD musical score: the main theme of the film is played over and over again, until we just want some big reptile to step on the orchestra.BAD psychology: The endlessly replayed musical theme is composed to arouse sympathy for the beast, when everything else in the film makes us dislike it. The disjunction is painful.BAD timing: This film goes on and one - the eggs are introduced for no other reason than to prolong a film that desperately needs trimming.I could go on, but what's the point. Roland Emmerich needs to find something other to do with his life, he's clearly not cut out to make movies. In an interview on a featurette in the DVD release of this film, director Roland Emmerich says that he wanted to make a ""completely different"" Godzilla, the original being - according to him - out of date. Does this man suffer from brain damage? Godzilla doesn't need to be different. Godzilla is the protagonist of a popular ongoing series of films made in Japan. Beginning in 1984, the producers of these films decided they would gradually update the series to take advantage of new special effects technology. They didn't need some snotty Occidental to show them how to do this. They were gracious enough to license out the series to Americans because they know our fascination with these films. I suspect they assumed that an American entry into the series would give it new energy. Instead, their series' title was ripped-off for a remake of a completely other American film.If you're going to make a pastiche of a famous adventure series, you had better find some way to fit your pastiche into the series as a whole. For instance there are many pastiche Sherlock Holmes stories written by authors other than Arthur Conan Doyle. Some of these stories attempt to fill in a gap in the original series - the years following Holmes' struggle with Professor Moriarity at the Reichenbach Falls, when Watson loses touch with Holmes for a few years. So a reader is permitted to imagine Holmes as having lived a whole life - no past Holmes episode is denied; no Holmes story to come is effected. The reader can thus ignore the question of authorship and concentrate on following the adventurous life of the great detective.While the original Godzilla series is not chronologically sequential (A few are, presumably, set in an ""alternate universe""), they do share a remarkably consistent set of themes and subtexts. And while the appearance of Godzilla changes over the years, these changes are consistent with the notion that the monster somehow matures with every film.It is utterly pointless, therefore, to make a Godzilla film without any Godzilla in it. It is actually insulting - to the producers of the original series and to its audience - to discard the themes that brought the audience to the original series in the first place. And it is absolutely stupid (and racist) to presume that, because you work in Hollywood rather than Tokyo, you can get away with it.So this is not a Godzilla film - what is it really? It happens to be an over-bloated overly-rewritten remake of the Ray Harryhausen classic, ""Beast From 20,000 Fanthoms"". That film is also way better than this one; heck, while made in the '50s, even its special effects are better.Again, if you have two hours of spare time, and you can think of nothing else to do with your life, by all means let Emmerich give your brain a visual enema with this movie. But keep the toilet-paper handy, I guarantee watching this will leave a mess to clean-up.",Godzilla

(PG-13)Japan's most famous giant lizard gets rebooted and rerouted to NYC, where it climbs out of the sea and tries to catch a Broadway show, then accidentally steps on and knocks over a bunch of stuff, which makes the mayor and military very unhappy. Spectacularly stupid and visually unspectacular, this monstrosity is the very definition of a tentpole-wannabe; even on the level of effects-driven ""popcorn entertainment,"" it's never wise to insult the intelligence of the audience this badly. Broderick isn't exactly a prime candidate for action-junk leading man, but it's hapless Pitillo that could really use a good reptile-on-a-rampage squashing (at least Reno emerges unscathed, as expected). For anyone afraid that it might get monotonous watching ol' Gojira stomp around a city for over two hours, rest assured that there's an extended bit involving its newly-hatched babies scurrying about and looking for human-flavored snacks that shamelessly rips off the ""Jurassic Park"" raptor scenes.

Oh, and the special effects have their say too!",6,8 January 2007,"When a ship is attacked at sea by an monster that is suspected to have a politically damaging source of origin, Matthew Broderick is called in as an expert in the effects of radiation on lifeforms.From the start Jean Reno, an insurance investigator is hot on the tail of Broderick and the creature to get some answers of his own.Now Matthew Broderick has a great knack of appearing in bad films and delivering poor performances (e.g. Inspector Gadget, The Cable Guy) where Jean Reno is pretty much the opposite (e.g. Leon, Ronin) Thank god when Reno appears in a film that is - Shall we say, less intelligent and full of cheese, he can still deliver an believable and serious performance.In Godzilla it is quite literally only Reno and the special effects team that emerge with the credit of hauling this film out from the depths it seemed so desperate to reach.Anyway, that's enough of bashing this movie - What about the good points? I hear you ask. Well beneath the cheesy dialogue and the simplistic story, there is a fun action film, crammed with great visuals and plenty of action. But seriously, that's all it is; a very expensive bit of fun, Reno's strong performance and the stunning special effects cannot make this film anything more that.6/10 I enjoyed it for what it is, and as a cheesy action flick it's OK",Godzilla

That film had a director whose personality (and possibly ego) was big enough to sit alongside that of the franchise and not be overshadowed by it.  Godzilla has a big tradition in Japan, and sadly, with this film it has been reduced to a Saturday matinee type feature.Aliens also had a star who had been made into an icon by the success of the first film.  The closest we come to a headliner in this picture is a moonlighting Jean Reno.  Brooding and vaguely charismatic he may be, but he doesn't have the ability to anchor the audiences attention firmly to what's happening onscreen.  Despite some manful efforts from the cast, the film struggles to stay afloat without the influence of a major star.An average attempt at a big-budget crowd pleaser, which has some impressive moments but doesn't deliver the end product we perhaps had a right to expect given the source of its inspiration.",Godzilla
75,Screen_Blitz,"Godzilla is a shoddily crafted monster extravaganza tainted with poor acting, incompetent writing, and a misguided direction",4,3 February 2017,"In the history of Hollywood's renditions of the classic titular dinosaur wrecking havoc on a metropolitan city, Roland Emmerich's re-imagining of the source material is arguably one of the worst. Emmerich, the man behind the 1996 blockbuster hit 'Independence Day' puts his heart in wrecking mass destruction in his films. Whether it involves destroying major landmarks such as the White House, the Chrysler building, and the Empire State Building, or racking up an abundant body count in an endless barrage of explosive special-effects mayhem (or both); Emmerich's fingerprints are almost always on display when his films come on screen. His extravagant style of filmmaking shows up on full blast in this big-budget monster feature, but without capturing the true spirit of its classic primitive monster that's been popping in theaters since 1954. Suffering from a sorely incompetent script co-written by Dean Devlin, poor performances, and Emmerich's misguided direction, Godzilla transpires to an unappetizing big-budget disaster flick that simply crashes and burns. Set in Manhattan, New York, this follows biologist Nick Tatopoulos (played by Matthew Broderick) who discovers the giant dinosaur as it makes it's way to the Big Apple and wrecks havoc while laying eggs in an underground nest. Teaming up with his former girlfriend Audrey (played by Maria Patillo), freelance news photographer Victor Palotti (played by Hank Azaria), and French secret service agent Phillipe Roche (played by Jean Reno); Nick must make a daunting attempt to bring the enormous creature down and save the city from utter destruction.There is very little reason to expect Roland Emmerich to make a masterpiece out of the giant prehistoric monster, but certainly no reason why not to expect him to at least capture the spirit of the classic titular monster. Unfortunately, what transpires is a bombastic monster attack extravaganza that strolls along with a brain-dead screenplay and a shortage of thrills. That is not say the film doesn't kick off on a somewhat promising start. The opening minutes of the dinosaur arriving in the city causing chaos and destruction everywhere are sort of fun to watch. After while, the thrills and excitement quickly wear off as the film bogs down on flamboyant action sequences while taking for granted any real attempts on suspense. And Roland Emmerich makes use of plenty of explosions and plenty of collateral destruction to make Michael Bay blush. It is not until the second half when the film completely throws logic out the window. This is when Emmerich takes the action in a underground in a battle against thousands of Godzilla's babies. By then, all the chaos ensues into an unintentionally funny 'Jurassic Park' rip-off, and without sense of rationality. How is Godzilla as tall as a building in the beginning, yet able to fit inside a subway station toward the end? These sequences are supposed to be fun, but fail make any sense. This definitely isn't say that Roland Emmerich doesn't pack a fair use of state-of-the-art special effects, though nothing innovative.Matthew Broderick established himself as a household name upon his charismatic portrayal in the 80s classic comedy 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', though perhaps not on Hollywood's A-list. Here, he plays a likable biologist who becomes a heroic hand at saving the city of Manhattan from Godzilla's havoc but delivers nothing beyond a surface-level performance with a slew of cheesy dialogue. And the character himself develops to almost nothing but a punching bag of botched humor involving characters failing to pronounce his last name. Maria Patillo who plays his former girlfriend however, phones in a rather wooden performance that falls short of emotion. Jean Reno, the star of Luc Besson's 'Leon: The Professional' in 1994 plays a secret service agent who provides a little comic relief with a few good one-liners sprinkled here and there, but nothing memorable. Hank Azaria, the best known for providing the voices of various characters in Fox's animated television series 'The Simpsons' is also given his time to shine, but falls victim to a slew of unfunny jokes nearly every minute he's on screen. The film's biggest and arguably the most bizarre attempt at meta-humor comes from Michael Lerner and Lorry Goldman playing parodies of film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, even mocking Ebert's trademark ""thumbs up"". Is this really supposed be funny? Maybe if they were actually given something to do with the plot.Godzilla is a poorly crafted rendition of it's classic source material that suffers from a thoroughly misguided direction by Roland Emmerich, a slew of poor performances, and an overall absent-minded script that fails to capture the heart and soul of the titular creature. In short, it is a mind-numbing big-budget action spectacle that may provide some pleasing value in it's top-notch special effects, but nothing fascinating.",Godzilla
76,BrandtSponseller,Drastically underrated,9,8 March 2005,"After bizarre attacks on a Japanese freighter, first the French then the U.S. learn of the existence of an apparent modern ""dinosaur"". When it's suspected that radiation from nuclear weapons testing in French Polynesia may have instead produced the monster, biological radiation specialist Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is called to the scene. While investigating the monster's path of destruction, a new sighting arrives--just off the coast of New York City! It's no secret that Godzilla has been much maligned. Even Fangoria editor Tony Timpone stated in an editorial that he thought it sucked, and he's usually willing to give movies the benefit of the doubt. The reasons why director Roland Emmerich's version of Godzilla is hated are as varied as people stating opinions. But I tend to think that there is also a strong bandwagon effect with this film that will be tempered by time. There are already signs of a number of people giving it a second look and lessening the severity of their criticism.The chief complaint seems to come from a very vocal but relatively small crowd of fanboy purists--they dislike that Godzilla is different here. In the Japanese films, made by the Toho production company, Godzilla is a guy in a rubber suit who stomps on models of buildings and such. He tends to lumber, as irrelevant military attacks on him provide pretty fireworks. Most Godzilla films feature him fighting some other monster, ""professional wrestling"" style, and Godzilla arbitrarily falls down and gets back up as he is attacked and attacks with various ""death rays"" from his mouth, eyes, etc. Now that might sound like I don't like the typical Godzilla film, but that's not true. I like them quite a bit, but a big part of the reason why is that most of them are very cheesy. I'm a fan of bizarre cheese/camp, and you get tons of that in Godzilla films.But I'm not a purist. To me, there's no good reason why Emmerich's Godzilla needs to be similar to the Toho incarnations, which in fact are often quite different from and inconsistent with each other, too. At this point, I see Godzilla more as a recurring character type--think of the various instantiations of Dracula or Frankenstein throughout the 20th Century. The Toho films can't really be seen as chapters in a single, long story. But whether their arguments are wrong or not, the fanboy purists are at least noisy and prolific, and too many people are followers.If Emmerich would have given us a guy in a rubber suit, acting just like the Toho Godzillas (not ""Godzilla""), with the typical gobbledy-gook of a Toho script, this film would have bombed even worse (if we can call a 100 million dollar film that made a profit a ""bomb"") and the fanboys would have still found something to complain about. Even though I love the Toho Godzilla films, too, we can't deny that they do not tend to be bestsellers on video in the U.S., despite the fact that they're readily available for purchase.So what Emmerich gives us instead is an epic, expensive-looking film that spans a number of genres, features more coherent dialogue and subplots than a typical Toho Godzilla film, and showcases a redesigned, mostly cgi cast of monsters, where Godzilla looks and behaves much more like a ""real"" giant, mutant lizard. For those of us who are not purists, who do not care if our opinions match the majority, and who evaluate films on all or their technical and artistic levels, it's difficult to deny that Godzilla has many merits.For example, the cinematography in this film is gorgeous. The sound design is superb and the soundtrack (score and songs) works well with the film. All of the action sequences, and they comprise a large percentage of the film, are expertly staged--Emmerich doesn't resort to darkness, blur-cams and overly quick cuts like many other directors. It's always easy to follow the narrative during action scenes, it's always easy to see what's going on, and it's always coherent. That goes for the non-action scenes, too--the entire film is ingeniously designed in terms of the progression from one sequence to another. Also, the cgi is amazing--it's often difficult to tell where it stops and mechanicals/models begin.But the story is great, too. Broderick's Tatopoulos is an attractive anti-hero, a nerdish scientist who solve dilemmas with his professional knowledge. The other hero is Jean Reno as Philippe Roache, a humorously enigmatic French ""insurance agent"". The obligatory romantic subplot, involving Tatopoulos and Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) surprisingly avoids clichés, and Timmonds provides a launching pad for an all-too-honest satire of the media.Satire is high up on Emmerich's agenda. Godzilla not only satirizes the media, but the military, New York/New Yorkers, film critics, and even monster movies. While the film is simultaneously giving us a lot of genres--sci-fi, horror, adventure, war film, drama, etc. the most unexpected motif is the almost cartoonish, spoof-like humor. Godzilla is more frequently laugh-out-loud funny that anyone expected it to be. It's not just one-liners and overt jokes, although those are certainly present, but the amped up intentional absurdity of situations such as the final taxi cab ""chase"".Even if you think that Godzilla has some internal problems as an artwork (and I agree that there is a slight clunkiness in parts of the narrative flow--it caused me to subtract a point), there's no way it deserves the trashing it's received so far. This is at least a well-made film on a technical level, and if you have any taste for slightly campy sci-fi/monster flicks, you should find much to enjoy here.",Godzilla
77,RNMorton,The Big Guy deserved much better,2,17 October 1999,"Godzilla's return to the big screen is major flop.  Cast and special effects could have made for a good movie, but the script torpedoes all that.

78,Jeremy_Urquhart,One of the first movies I remember truly disliking,3,6 April 2020,"I was 12 years old. Godzilla (1998) was on tv. I'd loved dinosaurs throughout my childhood, so surely I could get around a giant radioactive lizard, right?But even at that age, this film seemed bad. Something was just off. It's the first movie I remember picking apart, and finding inconsistencies and ridiculous moments within. Some people in my life say I'm too critical and analytical when it comes to movies, and this film might be responsible for kick-starting that cynical streak within me.It would have been the first Godzilla film I ever watched, and honestly, what a terrible introduction to the franchise. It's a Godzilla film in name only, really. It's too long, too sloppy, and too boring to count itself as a true Godzilla film.But we all know the purists hate it, so there's little reason for me to go on. Now 13 years later, I've finally seen every other Godzilla movie, and they all have more to offer than this one (with the possible exception of 1969's All Monster's Attack, which is essentially a clip show of scenes from previous movies, and therefore easy to forget about).I don't have any inclination to rewatch this. If I didn't like it as a child, I'd probably like it even less than an adult, and it's likely all I'd get from losing over 2 hours of my life to the movie would be the realisation that 3/10 is too generous.Where to go for a better Godzilla movie, someone may ask? Literally anywhere else. Even the two recent American Godzilla movies, if you must.If this helped the legitimate Godzilla movies get more exposure outside Japan then maybe this infamous mess did some good. And the smackdown this inclination of Godzilla receives in 2004's Final Wars is wonderful. Yet for Godzilla fans (and fans of well made movies in general), I'd advise staying away, unless you're even younger than I was when I sat through this, feeling youthful, frustrated, and utterly perplexed.",Godzilla

Well, it doesn't.  So the movie sucks.I was bored in this film, so much so that I almost fell asleep and when I saw the film unfolding exactly the way my brother prophesized it to do, I laughed.  It's too bad they couldn't have proved him wrong because I would have kept a bit more money that Darrel took from me because I lost the bet.This is an awful movie and the true champion of the summer has to go to Armageddon.

80,gizmomogwai,America butchers Godzilla once again,5,23 September 2012,"The 1954 Japanese classic film Godzilla is very good as a horror film and a fun movie, which was thankfully recently given Criterion treatment. Alas, in the West the film has not always been available in its true form. In 1956 it was butchered thoroughly, massively edited and manipulated into Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, a goofy movie in badly dubbed English. If that weren't enough, in 1998 the Americans decided to butcher Godzilla again, with a movie about as bad- Godzilla, by the makers of the smash hit Independence Day (1996).Because of my love of Independence Day as a youth, when I saw Godzilla '98 in theatres I assumed I had to like it, and tried to convince myself it was a good movie, much as with Batman and Robin the year before. Time has made me realize how much of that was self-deception, however. Godzilla '98 is loud and often stupid, and the action scenes never really blew me away. Most of the damage to New York City in the film is done not by Godzilla but by the army trying to kill the creature. The moments of comic relief all fall flat (we were supposed to be rolling over laughing every time someone called Broderick ""the worm guy""). The movie repeatedly pulls the same tricks, with people thinking they're clear of danger before Godzilla pops up suddenly again. The dialogue is often painful, as adult characters interact as if they were children (""You were supposed to be my friend, I trusted you."")Some parts defy logic. Why can't the military ever actually shoot Godzilla? Are we really supposed to believe Godzilla can pick up a car in his mouth and crunch on it but the car and people inside it are still functioning? The Nostalgia Critic also did a good job illustrating how the ""Babyzilla"" scenes imitate the raptor scenes in Jurassic Park (1993). Admittedly, I still love this movie's soundtrack. ""Macy Day Parade"" by Michael Penn and ""Untitled"" by Silverchair are beautiful songs, though unfortunately they don't seem to be in the film itself, which favours ""Come With Me"" by Puff Daddy which is only sort of okay because it sounds like ""Kashmir."" The special effects are mostly good, although we don't actually get a good look at Godzilla besides his feet. The movie also had an attractive ad campaign. One commercial showed Godzilla stepping on and destroying a tyrannosaur fossil, and that unfortunately isn't in the movie either. Ultimately, Godzilla '98 has none of the charm of the Japanese original, and is more of a cliché Hollywood disaster movie.",Godzilla
81,vip_ebriega,A monstrous mixed bag.,5,27 April 2007,"My Take: It's all spectacle, no thrills. The final hour is satisfying though. Rated PG-13I have to admit that back when I was a kid, I really loved watching ""Godzilla"", mainly because I'm a sucker for monster movies, especially dinosaur films. Another reason is that film criticism does not apply to me yet. Now that it applies, I began to see the real colors of ""Godzilla"", a weak and flawed film the relies too heavily on effects than plot, pacing and interest. The second half is somehow exciting, but it's the overlong and boring first half that's the problem. If you have it on DVD, you can just fast-forward it to the good parts, but trust me, the first half is darn long. So long (and boring) it almost chews up the entire running time of the film.The problem of ""special-effects vs. good story"" is not something new to director Roland Emmerich and co-writer/producer Dean Devlin, who made INDEPENDENCE DAY. But ID4 didn't bore me because it was fun as it is, GODZILLA on the other hand spent too much time showing us the giant lizard's feet than forming much action or human characters among them.Another thing about this film, is that it tries so hard to be another ""Jurassic Park"", adding, of course, the rampage of the baby Godzillas and an enjoyable final chase scene. interesting thing about the film. Obviously, it's no ""Jurassic Park"", and even not ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"". It is, mainly, a large lizard movie that focuses more in ""destroying"" New York than giving audiences what they came for.I'd be lying if a say I didn't enjoy this film. It somewhat takes off on the second half, but getting there is just far too long, even for someone (or something) as big as the big ""G"". Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Godzilla
82,educallejero,A little rant 20 years later!,2,8 December 2018,"What? How you can miss so bad?
You had a GIGANTIC LIZARD/DINOSAUR to have us on our heels!I watched this movie when I was 11, at the theater. This movie didn't need to be really good to make love it. I was 11yo average kid dumb (I might still be, but even if I am, which Im not, but let's say I am, which I'm not, I'm still not THAT dumb just by simple nature), so with a 1.40 hs movie, with a Godzilla tease every 8-15 minutes until the final act, you probably would've gotten me. The bad script, dialogue and lack of logic in the movie could've been forgotten by that kid very easily (harder now).In the end, the movie just was doomed from the start when they chose Matthew Broderick. He's just an awful ""miracle"" of nature. Only in the disgustingly awful 90's (post-Berlin Wall? maybe has something to do? Like, now there is no competition, why would even try to show how much better United States is?).Anyways. Once you cast such a talentless hack, you either make the movie ""a joke"" and go for it, with lots of humor, no realism whatsoever, little plausibility, and a more adventuristic approach.They.Did.Not.Do.That.

84,juliankennedy23,Peek a Boo,7,14 March 2019,"Godzilla: 7 out of 10: Godzilla or someone pretending to be Godzilla attacks New York and only Matthew Brodrick and the French Secret Service can save the Big Apple.This is not the worst Godzilla film ever made, not by a long shot. The lack of endless little boys in short pants put this effort ahead of much of the filmography. Overall it is an entertaining if often painfully dated film. Like Three Kings after the second Iraq war Godzilla today is a different viewing experience with today's eyes.Let us ask and answer some questions.Were special effects really that bad during the nineties? You know I am unclear on that as well. I always thought the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park looked really good and that was five years earlier than this film in 1993 and the Matrix came out only a year later than this in 1999. I recently resaw Godzilla in 4k streaming on Netflix and yikes. Should have gone with a guy in the suit.Why did they redesign Godzilla? The story is they wanted to make her more realistic. Honestly, the new one is even sillier. I mean to support that kind of weight you are going to need big thighs. It just looks all kinds of wrong and the movie doesn't help matters by having her seemingly change size throughout the film.The look is not the worse thing mind you. It is Godzillas new special... I'm going with ability. She is apparently a master at hide and seek. Yes, the 278 foot five hundred ton Godzilla plays peek a boo with the American Army. The movie really tries to sell this hard. It does not work.Wasn't it was nice of those helicopters to fly low enough for Godzilla to eat them? I know right. I mean their regular flying ceiling is twenty thousand feet but let us fly at 100 feet between buildings that btw look nothing like Manhatten.And those submarines in the Hudson seemed to have an awful time trying to find her? Yeah, I was wondering about that as well. I mean the Hudson and the east river are about 40 feet deep in most place. I have no idea where they were. Even Long Island Sound at its deepest wouldn't hide Godzilla. Facts and logic were not this films friend.Overall I enjoyed my revisit with this Godzilla. The nostalgia was nice and I liked the fact Broderick's love interest, the very cute Maria Pitillo, was probably one the evilest femme fatale in the history of movies and still takes her back at the end.It has been common recently to revisit this film and declare it not that bad. I tend to agree it is not that bad. Not that good as well mind you but at least some form of Godzilla shows up in this one.",Godzilla
85,spookyrat1,All Crown - No Filling!,3,29 May 2019,"I don't mind some Roland Emmerich films. I tend to be more interested though in the ones that don't focus on disasters and monsters. Godzilla has both. It's a big budget sci-fi action film full of so-called spectacle, but at its heart it's terribly empty and lacking in any genuine dramatic content.There's no sense of mystery nor surprise. Godzilla is rolled out in the first minute of the movie, after which we get this confusing global whip around, where we find characters such as Dr. Niko ""Nick"" Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) an NRC scientist, who is in the Ukraine researching the effects of radiation on wildlife. Within a couple of minutes, he's summoned to Tahiti, then Panama, then Jamaica. All I could think was that he must be experiencing a hell of a jet lag. But no, this is the way Emmerich unfurls the little narrative that we get. I don't think it was ever actually confirmed in the movie, but I think we're expected to believe that Godzilla is a mutated marine iguana, who has been affected by French (LOL!) atomic testing (rather than American).Anyway the big guy finds his way to New York, where unsurprisingly again, he/she (don't ask) causes a hell of a lot of trouble around the Manhattan area and we later find that he/she is capable of giving birth to 200 (what looked to me like) tyrannosaurus rexes. Yep! All of a sudden there are all these dinosaurs running around. Shades of Jurassic Park! The story is just weird, but one can easily see that Emmerich was clearly intent on moving into Steven Spielberg's dinosaur domain under any illogical circumstances.This movie is all about visual effects, borrowed ideas from better films (especially those from Spielberg) clichéd dialogue, flimsy and formulaic narratives, illogical plot developments, and lack of character depth. Broderick is a nerdy Sam Neill without the required gravitas, but with a ridiculous beret for goodness sake. He has a love interest played by someone by the name of Maria Pitillo, of whom I've never heard anything about, before or since. She's cute but ... ! Jean Reno turns up looking guilty ... for turning up in a movie like this.Interesting things: 1 Why is it raining in so many scenes? Is rain a Godzilla thing? It gets seriously tiresome. In Blade Runner there was a reason, but Godzilla? 2 Godzilla seems to change in size depending on the circumstances required of a given ""action"" scene. Is it possible for instance, that the US forces with all their advanced technology are incapable of finding a 120 m creature hiding in the Hudson River? 3 How many times in movies now has Roland Emmerich supervised the destruction of New York? Does he ever get sick of it?I've given this movie a 3/10. It's not really worth that, but I figure that with a production this big, at least a lot of people got a lot of work out of it and that's got to be surely worth something.",Godzilla

Combined as a rip-off of JURASSIC PARK by modern standards, GODZILLA is another in recent attempts to win over new generations of young moviegoers.

That pretty much explains why Sony wanted another blockbuster franchise since MEN IN BLACK to gain control of the movie industry, and I'm sorry to say that their luck has run out. An aged and weakling plot isn't the only disease it suffers from. Godzilla's character design is a terrible pity and so does its politically incorrect New York setting.

91,anselmdaniel,Generically bad monster movie,5,17 August 2019,"This review contains spoilers.Godzilla is a monster movie that premiered in 1998. The movie is directed by Roland Emmerich. It is based on the character Godzilla by Toho. The movie stars Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo. A mutated lizard attacks New York City to create a nest for its young.Godzilla 1998 is a bad movie. From the beginning of the movie, the script is not taking the original story into account. This origin of Godzilla does not feature anything related to extensive United States nuclear weapon testing. The origin simply has Godzilla appearing from mutated lizards found on Earth. It is not at all similar to the creatures created by Toho where they feed on radiation.The writing in this movie meanders trying to get the audience to care. It is hard to care when the characters are unlikable and are not even focused in this movie. The script wanted to make the movie about Godzilla and the destruction rather than about human characters. This would have been possible if Godzilla had more character. It is a creature for the humans in this movie to overcome rather than a separate entity with character.The action in this movie is tame. There could have been grander moments but the movie squanders these opportunities. The writing is to be blamed here for focusing too much on the bland human characters rather than on developing Godzilla through the human characters. The action goes from ridiculous set piece to ridiculous set piece that is not engaging to watch at all. There is not any tension in the scenes.I would not recommend Godzilla.Grade: D",Godzilla
92,gigan-92,Now to the Several Bad Points.....,2,10 April 2009,"The only so far American directed and produced Godzilla film. Dean Delvin (producer) and Roland Emmerich (director) were the idiots behind this film and this movie is a sheer disappointment to me on several levels. With such a big budget, of course being an American film, they were so many possibilities crushed by these two 'geniuses'. To begin this review I'll mention a few positive notes. A very few. First off, obviously, the special effects and budget is bigger than any Godzilla film before or after it. The CGI is put to good use and GINO (Godzilla In Name Only) does look decent. There were some all right action scenes, but nothing to get too excited about. And that's about it...Now to the bad points. For starters, this shouldn't even been called a Godzilla movie. GINO looks nothing like Godzilla! Instead of seeing the imposing reptilian, original, looking-monster we get a mutant iguana who is now an asexual T-Rex with no heat ray with NO HEAT RAY!!! Who also is from time to time actually running away from the military! Also, none of the other G-films exist in this film's timeline, not even ""Gojira""! Not a single reference or at least a cameo is made to any G-film or Japanese monster cinema in general! How crappy is that?! Secondly, I didn't like the cast, some who were bad actors. They only added to the non Godzillaness of the movie. Thirdly, the mood of the film is horrible. Godzilla was a victim of the H-bomb test. An invincible incarnation and physical manifestation of the Atomic Bomb. Even in the kiddy and campy days, Godzilla wasn't the giant mutant tarantula or grasshopper of the American 60s and 70s monster films. He was a different type of monster who broke the formula, something original. GINO is just the modern CGI version of those American crap monsters, a giant animal who was killed by jets pathetically. Which brings me to my next point- GINO is too weak and cowardly. Godzilla was invulnerable to tank shells and missiles and did not fear them. He in fact crushed them like bugs. Most of the actual city action/destruction was thanks to the military's bad aim, not GINO. Who, as mentioned before, runs away!! WTF? He wasn't even a threat really. Just a misunderstood giant asexual lizard who's only danger to society is comparable to that of multiplying locust and rabbits.I see Dean Delvin and Rolland Emmerich's whole scheme: Make a modern day giant monster film and to ensure its success they needed to use the name of the most popular monster on Earth: Godzilla. That's all they did, use his name. Those two had no respect for Godzilla, or the Japanese sci-fi genre at all. If they had, it certainly wouldn't have came out like this. That's one reason why I like ""Godzilla: Final Wars"". We finally see the real Godzilla blast GINO off the face of the Earth in a brisk 30 seconds!",Godzilla
93,Maniac-9,Truly awful movie,3,3 February 2012,The acting in this movie lets just say simply is atrocious. Matthew Broderick looked like he was just reading off of a teleprompter. Who's brilliant idea was it to cast Matthew Broderick of all people as an action hero? There's a reason that you haven't seen Maria Pitillo in any big movies since this. Kevin Dunn plays one of the most moronic military commanders ever.Since when does Godzilla run and hide? Or lay eggs for that matter? Godzilla is supposed to run through and knock over buildings not around them or climb them.All the baby Godzillas was something too much out of a Jurassic Park movie.Honestly I don't think that Roland Emmerich or Dean Devlin had ever seen a Godzilla movie prior to making this movie since this movie clearly doesn't deliver as a Godzilla movie at all.,Godzilla
94,Min111,Godzilla is a giant monster,8,31 May 2018,"I'm a big fan of Godzilla, and I was very excited for this movie. I remember getting Godzilla on video, and I use to watch it several times. I also remember watching it on television, and it was just as enjoyable. The movie was not poor as many people claim it to be, and I think it may be underrated. The plot was interesting. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that there wasn't enough of Godzilla which was a surprise considering the name of this movie is: Godzilla. The movie would've been more better if we seen more of Godzilla. I can't believe the size of Godzilla. How did it get this large? Godzilla is a threat to everyone. The events takes place in New York City. A group of heroes/people team up to save their city. What I don't understand is why this movie gets a lot of hate. Yes, it does have a few problems, but so do a lot of movies out there. Maybe a lot of people were expecting this movie to be like previous Godzilla movies, but that's obviously not going to happen in Hollywood for now. Unlike other Godzilla movies, this Godzilla movie has a good story for audiences to follow. The movie is very long though, but I feel that's a good thing because Godzilla is entertaining for the most part. I could watch this again if I wanted to since it was enjoyable. It looks better with repeated viewings. Godzilla is an action, science-fiction and thriller movie. I'm astonished to the amount of reviews Godzilla has received on here. I assume a lot of people have something to say on this movie. You either like or dislike the movie. Well, I like Godzilla. There was enough action for everyone to enjoy. If you're a fan of Godzilla, you'd like it otherwise you won't. Godzilla is a very good movie. I think it deserves a high rating.",Godzilla
95,Peach-2,All special effects and little else.,5,5 January 1999,"The new version of Godzilla is a total disaster of a movie. As far as the special effects are concerned, they were magnificent. The story was stupid and the acting was terrible. There are some great actors in this film and they are completely wasted. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich like to say that they make ""popcorn movies."" This is really just a term they use to show that they didn't know how to be creative with a new Godzilla movie. This film is overlong and the scenes with the baby Godzilla's are a blatant rip-off of Jurassic Park. If you're only interested in the special effects, then check it out. If you like a good movie, watch something else.",Godzilla
96,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,22 February 2021,"Another good work by Roland Emmerich, but the film has some problems. The cast has strengths and weaknesses. Jean Reno is fine as are the other supporting actors, but the protagonists are not quite on the scene. Broderick is often naive and does not give credibility to the viewer, hindering the involvement with his character. Pitillo is terrible making the same face and expressions in practically all his scenes. Her character relationship with Broderick's is mentioned but at no time did we hope for the two of them to be together due to the lack of chemistry between the characters. The story explains how the originally Japanese monster ends up in New York. However, in action, the film gets a little lost by not defining itself in a single genre. In my opinion the film should be treated as a great suspense / terror, with the intention of showing in fact the horror caused by the lizard in the city, through the perspective of ordinary citizens, authorities and specialists. The big problem, perhaps, was to have given little emphasis to the monster that ends up appearing in less scenes than it should and when it appears, no expectations are created in the viewer. The action scenes and effects of the film are great, especially at night, but perhaps they have been used too much, and everything that is too much harms the end result of anything, especially on the big screen. Regarding visual effects, makeup and the action scenes themselves, we can't say anything since they become even more grandiose in the hands of the competent blockbuster director Roland Emmerich, although in most of them it's all a bit surreal, especially the escape of protagonists of Madison Square Garden when they are surrounded by dozens of monster pups. It is an authentic popcorn film by Emmerich, where the viewer knows what he will find: fantastic effects, even more fantastic action scenes, with a typical script for this type of film. It certainly amuses and always deserves to be seen. But your biggest problem may be just having more fun than scaring. The action scenes without exaggeration with a greater atmosphere of suspense would be perfect, more or less in the Alien style of Ridley Scott. But be sure to watch this great movie success at least once!Film seen on February 22, 2021.",Godzilla
97,dr_foreman,attack of the ugly Americans,1,20 March 2004,"Most Americans have only been exposed to heavily edited, badly dubbed versions of the old Godzilla films, and they judge these films to be poor based on incomplete information.  In the original Japanese, with more serious acting, the oft-derided Toho movies are actually quite good, if you can tolerate foreign special effects that are more imaginative than convincing.  This movie, on the other hand, is a dog in any language. 
The first Japanese Godzilla film is an exploration of the atomic threat; Godzilla is not so much a monster as he is a walking symbol of the nuclear bomb.  In this film, radiation does play a part in mutating Godzilla into a giant, stooped-over and ludicrous-looking iguana, but the ""cautionary tale"" aspect of the original concept is lost.  Godzilla is supposed to be a condemnation of America's use of the bomb, but in this film, we pawn off the blame for Godzilla's creation on the French - how lame is that?Ridiculous attempts have been made to make the creature more ""realistic."" It reproduces (just so we can have a ""Jurassic Park"" ripoff sequence involving raptor-like babies), it doesn't breathe radioactive fire (arguably the coolest thing about the old Godzilla - why change a thing like that?), and it's not indestructible (again, another cool trait of the original creature is lost).  The old Godzilla waded through buildings, fire, missiles, lasers, EVERYTHING, on a mission of total destruction; the American Godzilla runs around New York, squawking and burrowing underground like a camera-shy mole.  Pathetic.Godzilla is one of the greatest science fiction icons out there, despite the negative (and poorly informed) opinions of his American viewers.  This movie, however, is a poor tribute to the big G, and an astounding waste of money as well.  The original films are full of great imagery, ranging from poetic to just downright funky.  There are no compelling visuals here to equal the sight of Mothra hatching and spreading its wings in ""GMK,"" or Godzilla squaring off against a three-headed gold dragon in the ""Ghidorah"" films, etc.  With all of the imaginative imagery removed, along with the Japanese culture, social commentary, and mysticism, the Godzilla concept is stale and ludicrous.As the closing credits for this movie began to roll, I groaned.  Audibly. That's the only time I've ever done something like that in a movie.  I mean, how hard is it to get this concept right?  All I wanted was a radiation-shooting, indestructible dinosaur smashing through a city.  I didn't even expect the subtexts to survive.  But my modest expectations were not met.  Godzilla is not only an inaccurate adaptation, it's also boring, and that's just plain unforgivable.",Godzilla
98,LebowskiT1000,I thought it was great...,10,6 September 1999,"As opposed to most people, I thought this movie was excellent.  You can't watch the movie and expect Shakespeare...it's Godzilla.  You have to appreciate the work that went into making this creature look so lifelike. This movie had spectacular special effects and a pretty decent story line. I thought this movie was great.  I didn't find the acting to be all that bad.  I would recommend watching this movie before you come to any conclusions.",Godzilla
99,OriginalMovieBuff21,Has Roland Emmerich ever made an excellent movie??,5,9 June 2004,"No, I don't think Roland Emmerich has ever made an excellent movie. Independence Day was good but that was his only good film. Godzilla was not good. Matthew Broderick was good in it but not as good as he was in Glory and The Lion King. What was Roland Emmerich thinking? I mean come on it's not the next Jurassic Park. I don't think Roland is a good director. I do want to see The Day After Tomorrow but I'm just worried if it's going to be terrible and I'd waste 6 dollars. I thought Godzilla was pretty entertaining and I did like some of the actors but that's all that's good about the movie. I also liked the songs and I bought the soundtrack but ignored seeing the movie the second time.5/10",Godzilla

101,saadanathan,Another good and well made Godzilla movie 6/10,6,30 May 2020,"As much as I'm surprised from how good the movie turned out to be, I got to admit it was really fun and enjoyable. The visual effects were good and better than I thought they would be, but they were still old, you can definitely tell the visual effects were from the late 90's and so it looks silly. Not like the visual effects in later years of Godzilla movies: (2014) and (2018). Even the character of Godzilla seemed a little funny and ridiculous. The updated version of him in the newer films looks better. Though I think the plot was more interesting than the plot we had in other of Godzilla's movies. Let's make a comparison: the movies of Godzilla today have a lot of green screen and CGI which is necessary but on the other hand takes control over the film. Which means the movie is left with characters screaming left and right and doing nothing.
Now with this version there is CGI and green screen but there is a bigger plot more interesting, with characters who do a lot and a bigger film set. Like it's not only green screen but real film locations. Overall an enjoyable film and it doesn't matter much which film of Godzilla you prefer, they'll likely be the same.",Godzilla
102,dragokin,not as bad as the critics may presume,6,30 April 2013,"Although i'm not a fan of Roland Emmerich, he's been able to surprise me with Anonymous (2011). However, i'm amused that Godzilla gets such low notes, especially since it is much better than his mind numbing efforts: Independence Day (1994), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), and 2012 (2009).Godzilla fulfills its purpose, especially since it used to be a fun flick to watch in the year of its release. Not a masterpiece, it is the one you go to see, have fun and forget when you get out of the theater. There are a lot of movies that tried very hard but failed to achieve this, among them the three aforementioned titles by the same author.There might be something we're missing in comparison with Japanese original, yet the transfer to Hollywood seemed successful to me.",Godzilla
103,departed07,Worst Movie Experience in my Life!,4,20 February 2008,"If you want to know what the best movie experience of my life, it's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It felt like I was in a grind-house theater where people from all sides had been cheering back and forth from the trailers to the beginning of the Warner Bros. logo. Girls were howling at Rupert Grint's arms, audiences of all ages were laughing at certain scenes and gasping at the special effects.Let me tell you the worst movie experience...I saw Godzilla on a Saturday in late May of 1998, the day of my middle school graduation. Sure the reviews weren't hot with the exception of Joel Siegel from Good Morning America saying how much fun it was; plus the film itself was marketing from commercials, action figures, trailers and interviewing the actors in all magazine publications from Disney Adventures to Nickelodeon.The plot of Godzilla involves the famous creature going from Japan to New York City where the monster wreaks havoc in town, causing panic on all sides. With the military involved, they hire field specialist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) to see where Godzilla is hiding and ask how to lure the beast into their tricks to kill him.Other characters include a French patriot (Jean Reno) who talks to witnesses from around the globe and tracks down Niko in New York to find any information leading towards Godzilla's hideout so him and his army could kill him before the marines. Maria Pitillo is Niko's ex-girlfriend who has dreams of being a reporter despite going out with the arrogant reporter (Harry Shearer) and being his little assistant.Not only is Godzilla too much of a long movie to be a blockbuster, but with many characters. I dealt with many things in the movie theater from hearing people booing at Godzilla because he wasn't the same as the earlier versions. Plus there was too many endings to think when the movie was going to be over along with the fact that somebody spilled soda on me.What a bad experience!",Godzilla

The characters were dull and it was too predictable.I don't recommend at all.",Godzilla
105,xamtaro,An enjoyable monster movie. But bad Godzilla movie,7,2 June 2014,"Before the critically acclaimed GODZILLA 2014, Hollywood had attempted an Americanized remake of the classic Japanese monster back in 1998. They turned to Roland Emmerich, the man responsible for turning old B movie genres (alien invasion, otherworldly adventures and genetically enhanced soldiers) into big blockbuster hits. Hoping that he would do the same for the giant monster movie. To that end, Hollywood gave him Godzilla, the much beloved Japanese giant monster, to remake to his vision.Americanized, neutered and changed beyond recognition, GODZILLA came out as a decent monster movie, but a disappointing Godzilla movie. That issue lies in the portrayal of the titular Titan. Gone is the thought provoking nuclear disaster allegory, replaced by a feeble ""man is the real monster"" Aesop. Nuclear tests in the 1960s gave rise to a giant mutant bisexual lizard. This creature makes a beeline for Manhattan where his arrival is met with mass hysteria and chaos. Named ""Godzilla"" by the media (thanks to a misinterpreted comment from a dying Japanese sailor), America sends wave after wave of military hardware against the beast, causing more destruction than ever but failing to bring it down. Into this chaos comes dr Nick Tatopolus, an expert on radiation mutations. As the military tracks the monster through new york's concrete jungle, nick discovers that the creature may not be the only one of its kind for much longer. The hunt is on with French secret agents, a budding romance with a wannabe reporter and a parody of some well known movie critics all thrown in. The first thing that stood out for me in this movie was how enjoyable the scenes with the human characters were. Like INDEPENDENCE DAY, Roland Emmerich peppers this movie with a healthy dose of humor. This makes the one dimensional characters less of a pain to sit through. Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn, Henry Shearer, all renown comedians, shine in their respective roles, delivering appropriate drama and laughs. Even Jean Reno does well as the offensively stereotyped French agent Philippe. Their scenes are fun, making an overall cliché ridden story more enjoyable than it is. Only the lead characters turn out a tad flat. Dr Nick, played by baby faced Matthew Broderick, brings his best ""wide eyed"" expressions to play as a man child caught up in the wonder of this giant beast yet running for his very life so he does not become dinner. Wide eyed shock, wide eyed awe, wide eyed terror, that seems to be his only expression. And the redundancy of Maria Pitillo's character Audrey cannot be understated.Of course, the true star of any Godzilla movie is Godzilla himself. This leaner, faster, velociraptor inspired look by designer Patrick Tatopolus is a terrific looking beast brought to life by cutting edge special effects. For a 1998 production, the effects still hold up well till today. The creature is elegant yet menacing, grand yet grim, with twin rows of fierce spikes on it's back, unbelievable agility and that trademark big chin that is common in Patrick Tatopolus' designs (eg: underworld's Lycans, pitch black's creatures, outlander's moorwen). However, it just isn't Godzilla, the unstoppable force of nature. It shows none of Godzilla's powers, nor his intelligence, nor his durability. Where the original Godzilla would be unfazed by missiles, smash tanks and planes out of his way, and carry on, this remade Godzilla squeals, runs and hides! Perhaps it would not have gotten that much hate had it been billed as a remake of THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, rather than a Godzilla movie. The basic plot of a lost giant creature drawn to New York and ultimately taken down by sheer luck and superior military firepower already mimics the broad strokes of that stop motion classic. Godzilla can easily pass off as a redesigned Rhedrosaur. But alas, here it is billed as a Godzilla movie. As a Godzilla movie, Roland Emmerich's multi million dollar blockbuster would rank in the lower thirds. Better than the likes of GODZILLA VS MEGALON, GODZILLA's REVENGE, GODZILLA FINAL WAR and GIGANTIS THE FIRE MONSTER. But compared to the rest of the Heisei era Godzilla movies, the early millennium era, and especially the original 1954 classic, this American remake is a disappointment. So disappointing in fact that the titular Titan of a lizard has been officially renamed ""Zilla"" by the original creators of the Godzilla franchise. I for one enjoyed this purely as a modern monster movie. It entertains, it has cool special effects, and it is good fun. Nothing much else though.",Godzilla
106,theshadow908,"Highly entertaining, but flawed.",6,31 May 2006,"Godzilla 1998 is a re imagining of the original Godzilla rather than a continuation. In this version, Godzilla is a far more realistic beast. He is an iguana vastly mutated by atomic bomb testing in French Polynisia rather than a prehistoric monster coming out of hiding. Godzilla migrates to New York where he makes a home for himself in the sewage and subway systems, occasionally coming above ground to wreak havoc. While Godzilla is not a great movie, it is highly entertaining. In fact, it's more entertaining than the original films.I'll start with the good. First off, Roland Emmerich is like Irwin Allen for the new generation. He makes some really good sci-fi/action/disaster movies, even though they don't have great acting or writing, the plots and action scenes are entertaining. Roland Emmerich puts his style into the new Godzilla and it makes for some great action sequences including a couple of scenes of Godzilla tearing through New York. Every scene involving Godzilla is about as entertaining as you can get. This movie even shows what I would believe to be an accurate view of how far the U.S. Army will go to end a threat by showing the army blowing up buildings and streets in an attempt to stop Godzilla.Now with the bad. The actors cast in this movie aren't great. Matthew Broderick is really weak is Nick Tatopolous, the scientist trying to learn from Godzilla. Maria Pitillo absolutely sucks as Nick's love interest. Jean Reno is always pretty good, but he's just playing his average french action hero in this. Hank Azaria isn't a great actor, but he's okay in this due to his comic relief. Oh, and what's with the Simpsons alumni in this film? Harry Shearer (Mr. Burns, Smithers) plays Charles Caiman, Hank Azaria (Moe, Apu) plays Animal, and Nancy Cartwright (Bart) plays Caiman's secretary. The dialogue in this film isn't anything special. All of the touchy love scenes that they threw in for dramatic effect fall flat.Overall, an entertaining film, but not an accomplishment.6.5/10",Godzilla
107,kdnor2011,"This movie is bashed, way to much",7,20 February 2010,"I never saw the original Japanese Godzilla, none of them. I've seen clips, and I basically know what it's about, but I have not seen them. Now that may be the reason I like this movie more than others. Believe me, if you are a fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies, I can totally understand why you would hate this movie. And even if you don't, it has flaws, I can see hating it even if you don't like the original. But despite it's flaws, it's many, many flaws, I do enjoy this movie.The CGI on Godzilla did not age well, at all. I mean at night he looks OK, at times. But whenever he appears during the day, and even at certain parts at night he just looks so fake. Maria Pitillo, the actress who played Audrey is horrible. I haven't seen her in anything else so I won't say she is a bad actress, but she certainly couldn't act in this movie. The Pacing is a little off, it doesn't get interesting until Godzilla hits New York. Before that it's very boring. And yes it has quite a few plot holes and errors in logic and continuity, and even geography.Yet despite all those flaws, it's a pretty fun movie to watch. Sure the CG on Godzilla isn't good, but the rest of the effects aren't bad. A lot of practical effects for the destruction of New York city. I actually really like Matthew Broderick in this movie, he's a likable enough protagonist. It does have enough action to keep you interested. From helicopter chases to running through Madison Square Garden while being chased by dinosaurs. There are some fun characters and it can be pretty funny at times.Is it a pretty bad remake, yes it is. Is it a rip off of Jurassic Park, yes it is. Does it have flaws, oh it sure as hell does. But is it fun to watch. For me it was. Yes I can totally see people not liking this movie, I understand. But I enjoy it. Take it for what it is, and it's a fun movie to watch.",Godzilla

109,LivingDog,I liked it except for ...,9,24 June 2006,"I really liked this since it didn't turn the creature into a monster. In the original the creature is a monster that wants to kill all the Japanese ... for some reason or another.In this remake Godzilla isn't a monster any more than the shark in Jaws. Yes it is dangerous and yes it is trying to survive but it has no intention like in the original.Besides the de-monsterization of the creature the discovery and realization of the creatures existence was done based on a scientific foundation - which is rare in the movies.So I liked this remake quite a bit except... for the blonde. The blonde utterly ruined the movie for me. #1 our hero is smart, hard-working, dedicated and focused. He's got his life together after being coldly dumped by none other than ... yep you guessed it - the blonde.So he's doing well when all of a sudden the news puts him on TV about some creature no one has seen but everyone is talking about. All of a sudden the blonde (whose career is taking a nosedive) sees him on TV and decides she loves him. (Remember she dumped him for her career... how convenient that now she chooses him.) If it wasn't for the forced and incredibly superficial needless worthless and pointless role of the blonde, this would have been a great movie... so I controlled by dissatisfaction for this detestable ingredient and decided the movie is better than all that ... yet no one agrees. :/ 9/10-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",Godzilla
110,SonicStuart,Pretty Good But Yet Decent,6,30 December 2008,"GodzillaStarring: Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, Kevin Dunn, Hank Azaria, Vicki Lewis, Harry Shearer and Malcolm DenareGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated: PG-13This is another movie that a lot of people and critics have bashed on but once again I disagree. The movie is about Nick Tatopolous (Matthew Broderick) who mainly studies earthworms until the government reassigns him to an even bigger (and I do mean bigger) assignment than earthworms and that is the footprints of a giant lizard that attacked some Japanese ships. Of course the lizard turns out to be not other than Godzilla which ends up running out and causing havoc in New York. So now it's up to Nick Tatopolous, The Government, Philippe Roache (Jean Reno) and his French organization to stop Godzilla. Now I have never seen any of the original Godzilla movies (the ones that were made from Japan) but from looking at the original Godzilla, this one doesn't have the same characteristics as the original, the original Godzilla breathes fire and is invincible and this one in the movie doesn't breathe fire and is weaker since he gets shot down by missiles when the only thing that can defeat him is another monster. But I most say that I take the design of Godzilla in this movie more serious than the original Godzilla because this Godzilla looks cool and the original Godzilla to me looks funny looking. I didn't like the fact that they made this Godzilla lay eggs because male lizards cannot lay eggs and the whole egg bit was just an excuse for Roland Emmerich to copy off of Jurassic Park instead of staying true to the character. I did think it was funny that this movie spoofed Siskel & Ebert (even though I like Siskel & Ebert) which Roland Emmerich did because they have never gave thumbs up to any of his movies, but Roland didn't even take advantage of this joke and even Gene Siskel mentioned that Roland Emmerich should've taken advantage of putting the critics in this movie. I also thought some of the dialogue in this movie could have been way better but other than that everything else is alright. The movie even had a surviving egg at the end that was going to set it up for a sequel but it never happened due to all the negative reviews. I would've liked to see a sequel to this movie but at least I'm glad that they continued this movie in a cartoon series which was good. Overall just decent popcorn entertainment.",Godzilla
111,eventlaunch,So silly,6,27 July 2019,I actually enjoyed this movie but having watched it again 2019 I have to say the years have not been kind to this movie it's just a silly movie,Godzilla
112,gpeevers,Only bearable at the time for the special effects,4,11 March 2019,"Starts with a good opening credits sequence that explains the origins of Godzilla, but then unfortunately the movie begins. We begin with the familiar formula of jumping around from one setup scene to the next, with the location identified on the bottom of the screen (using computer type font in a neon color with this strange typing sound effect). But these setup scenes serve no purpose though, as the opening credit sequence already explained Godzilla's origins sufficiently. This was the first sign that the writing is just terrible and there are many more. Admittedly trying to tell a believable story featuring 200 foot tall lizard is going to have its challenges, but this script bungles everything from character motivation to logistics and there are plot holes big enough for the aforementioned 200 foot tall lizard to walk through.The setup scenes also serve to introduce the human characters (another big mistake) for the audience. These include the brilliant scientist (Mathew Broderick), the mysterious French Insurance Investigator (Jean Reno), the ambitious young news room assistant who wants to be a reporter (Maria Pitillo) and the cameraman who just wants to help (Hanks Azaria). Both Broderick and Reno deserve some credit for trying and Reno actually manages to pull off most of his scenes, but you really have to wonder why he would want this on his resume. On the other hand Azaria looks lost along with most of the supporting players and Pitillo is just awful, though perhaps the aforementioned script can be at least partially to blame.To its credit the Special Effects are quite good if derivative of Jurassic Park and its sequel Lost World, the fact that the big effects sequences all happen at night in the rain allows the Effects artists ample opportunity to cover up any rough edges and make the combination of the background and effects all but seamless.There are a few laughs to be found, but they are far outweighed by the groans at the inane plot and some of the ill-advised attempts at humor (the Siskel and Ebert references are particularly cringe worthy).The filmmakers seem to have been trying to appeal to broad an audience and the result is that they don't satisfy any expectations. It's not scary enough (almost no excitement) for those looking for a thrill ride. It's not campy enough for those that enjoyed that element of the earlier Godzilla films. Also there is very little dram in any of the early scenes involving human characters, and the attempt at a love story between Broderick and Pitillo's characters is unnecessary, unconvincing and suffers every time Pitillo tries to express an emotion (she would win a Razzie for her performance).At the time of release it was only bearable for the special effects, and 20 years later those no longer stand up.",Godzilla
113,mnpollio,"Great creature, but an ill-conceived mess with a glut of extraneous characters",3,16 June 2011,"Certainly falls under the category of: What were they thinking? At the time that this went into production and was released, this seemed to be a sure thing as a popcorn summer hit. The duo behind the successful Independence Day would resurrect the Toho legend Godzilla from yesteryear to unleash a wave of destruction on New York. The film had massive awareness and was coming on the heels of the mega-hit Jurassic Park – so dinosaurs and their similars were definitely riding a wave of popularity.The film opens with depictions of nuclear testing by the French in the Pacific Ocean while indigenous lizards look on. Years later, this results in the gigantic mutation that is to become known as Godzilla. For some nonsensical reason, Godzilla starts swimming its way to New York City leaving a trail of underwhelming destruction in its wake. A group of disparate characters pool resources to locate the creature and end its rampage.Unfortunately, what should have been a sure thing here ends in a complete botch. The film is a haphazard mess hanging together by fraying threads.The visual effects are fairly strong, but the film keeps the creature off stage for practically the entire first half and then depicts most of its appearances in rainy darkness. Truthfully, has New York City ever been the victim of such an endless spate of torrential storms as is depicted in this film? The story is fairly asinine. It concocts a barely logical reason for Godzilla's sudden swim to NYC, but the destruction that the creature leaves in its path is so minimal that one wonders why so much military and scientific effort is put into the search for the creature. Indeed, NYC survives largely unscathed from Godzilla's wrath and few people seem in any genuine danger from the creature. A good deal of the destruction, in fact, comes from the blunders of the military in trying to detain the creature. Additionally, we are told that the creature is able to hide within the underground subway system, but given the enormous size of the creature that seems highly unlikely.Additionally, the film is absent of nearly any tension. Director Roland Emmerich imbues everything with such a strangely light-hearted tone that there is no urgency to this material or the ho-hum action scenes that he creates. In fact, the film only truly comes to life in the final 20 minutes and at that point it is simply too late and altogether too brief to salvage this sinking ship. Additionally, once we have the back story, it is hard to feel threatened by or root for the death of the title creature. In fact, some degree of kudos must go to the effects team and screenplay for drumming up sympathy for the creature's plight, particularly in its final moments on screen.By contrast, the people populating this foolishness should be so sympathetic. There are so many useless extraneous characters introduced into the action that one about needs a score card to keep trackand none of them are killed by the creature. We get Matthew Broderick's dorky scientist, French agent Jean Reno, reporter Maria Pitillo, cameraman Hank Azaria and his blowzy wife Arabella Field, Vicki Lewis' scientist and her assistant Malcolm Danare, military colonel Kevin Dunn, ineffectual mayor Michael Lerner and his assistant Lonny Goldman. The ideas on character development revolve around making Lerner and Goldman an idiotic riff on Siskel and Ebert and Reno a coffee fancier always on the hunt for a great cup of java. The film would not have suffered in the least by cutting or combining any number of these roles. For instance, the Pitillo and Lewis role could easily have been combined into one (preferably Lewis since Pitillo is a nightmare).Acting-wise, the film is equally lamentable. Broderick is all wrong to carry an action film and often comes across as a double holding the stage until the real leading man shows up. Azaria seems game, but Reno looks justifiably bored. The worst performance, hands down, comes from Pitillo, who spends the film whining, crying, pouting and delivering her lines in a voice that reminds one of a low-rent Betty Boop. Simply excruciating.",Godzilla
114,The_Wood,Godzilla equals smiles 8/10,9,4 May 2002,"Roland Emmerich's Godzilla failed with geek-boys who were mad the film didn't feature a man in a rubber suit.  It angered elitists because they couldn't imagine themselves enjoying a film about a giant lizard in a city. However, I found myself pleasantly surprised with this picture, and that is why I am coming to the defense of my friend Godzilla.  The Japanese can keep their guy in the rubber suit, I like this Godzilla, because he's mean and ugly and he has cravings for fish.  I like the way he storms through New York City like he owns the place and decides to give a little hell to Matthew Broderick, Hank Azaria, and Jean Reno.I found Godzilla had exactly what I expected out this type of picture: havoc!  I walked out of Spider-Man yesterday very disappointed.  I felt disappointed because it wasn't able to have fun with itself like most summer pictures do.  I walked into a store, and their I saw my old buddy Godzilla sitting on the used DVD rack.  I picked the little guy up, took him home, and enjoyed the hell out of him.  Just like a summer popcorn film should be: BIG, DUMB, AND FUN.  This movie is a hoot!",Godzilla

118,tburke85,Godzilla A Good Remake But Overlong,7,17 June 2009,"Godzilla is a good remake but overlong from director Roland Emmerich whose admirable in making this movie but a slow pacing at times and a predictable ending is what weighed it down but it's still not that bad it just could've been better. The cast for the most part are solid in their roles including Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pittillo, Hank Azaria, and Kevin Dunn. The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well but don't have much to do. The special effects are impressive especially for that time and it does off some suspense. The Godzilla creature is cool but you can tell it's CG most of the time and seemed to resemble a giant version of the raptors in Jurassica Park movies. Godzilla looked terrific none the less showing audiences glimpses of it first before revealing what looks like in full view. The action sequences are well executed and there is some comic relief mostly because of Azaria. The pacing of the movie was a little slow at times but once the action kicks into high gear things seemed to movie at a steady pace from there. The surprise at the end I saw coming and does sort of leave it open for a possible sequel but if they had changed the conclusion the film would've been a little better. Overall despite its flaws, Godzilla is for the most part an entertaining film with enough action, cool special effects, some suspense, thrills, humor, a little romance, and decent performances by the cast who make it worthing watching at least once.",Godzilla

It isn't quite Godzilla since they changed the creature quite a bit, but I still think it's an approach worth being made and looked at.
There's build-up to the story with the science etc., first time Godzilla appears is epic.
Give it a chance. I think a lot of ratings here are way too low and this movie definitely deserves more than 5.3. Maybe my 10* are too high and it should be more like a 7, but I need to see a higher score for it in total.",Godzilla

However I was thoroughly disappointed.Nuclear bombs alter an iguana or something and it turns super big and becomes ""Godzilla"".,...............thats it for story pretty much.I really hated this movie because this is nothing like how Godzilla is in the great Japanese movies. He is not a dinosaur in this one, just a big lizard and his character in this has no heart it feels. Hes also got no personality. Also he does not really attack the city, he just runs around and when the army attacks him he runs away. Finally he cant even breathe radioactive fire. What were they thinking? You can alter certain things about a character if they aren't important, but these are all well established and important character traits of Godzilla that were all not done well at all.Also this movie is a downer cause it rains the whole movie. I just think it makes you get a bad feeling when watching it.The human cast was OK, I actually like Matthew Broderick. Hank Azaria is cool, but other than that nothing special.Basically this is not the Godzilla I grew up to love as a kid. I do not recommend this horrible film.",Godzilla

122,swedzin,"It's big, it's scary, it's loud it's Godzilla!",6,21 September 2015,"Yep, Hollywood did it again. They took yet another Japanese star and turn it into a movie, this time under the direction of Roland Emmerich. Now I will never, ever deny that I enjoy this film, I really do. I always wanted it in my collection, I was amazed by the trailer and I was blown away by the film but in all that shock and awe alas the movie is one large, noisy turd as most of the Emmerich films. But, I got to admit, Emmerich can make some highly entertaining turd films. And I think this is one of my favorite of all Emmerich films ever I still have it in my DVD collection. Now, if you have watched the original Gojira (1954), then you realize that you are expecting a totally different story. First the movie opens with atomic bomb footage, in French Polynesia, something big emerged from the depths and attacked a Japanese fishing ship. Yep, that's one of those ""slap in the face"" scenes, where the writer, or director wants to say to the original Japanese film – our monster is better! Well talking about ego. And after that, another accident occurred, this time with US fishing boats. Now that's entirely different from Japanese movies. In their movies we saw Godzilla fights numerous monsters, aliens and even King Kong but the Americans are the one who increased the plot with the Godzilla's plans to make a nest in New York where else? But, the idea of nesting? Hmmm well, I guess that we needed a new idea for a big lizard. And it's not male, or female, it breeds asexual. Although I thought that there are two big lizards, but fortunately I was wrong, and good thing I was wrong. So, the story is simply American in a simple American way. It's bearable.Time for actors: Matthew Broderick as Dr. Tatopoulos. Matthew was definitively very well payed for this film, so he looked all the time without any emotions, he was just staring at people and stuff and a big lizard and talk in his usual youngster voice and the guy never seems to get old. But, what I like about his performance that he constantly looked funny, especially in Madison Square Garden scenes, he entertained me pretty enough. Jean Reno plays Philippe Roache the French intelligence agent who came to ""clean up his sh*t"". What do I mean by that? Now this is not a big spoiler the French atomic testing were done by French people and that's why Roache (his last name was there to make ridicule of him) is here. Reno was good, in his own French guy in US element. He was the badass of the film. We have Maria Pitillo as Audrey Timmonds, a former girlfriend of Nick's. Pitillo was so funny, so bad in her performance, no wonder you didn't saw her anywhere else in other films, this film remains the best known in her career. Hank Azaria? Oh, that's not all. Harry Shearer and Nancy Cartwright are also in the film. Moe the Bartender , Mr. Burns and Bart Simpson are in the film? What was that for? You expect for American audience to recognize them? To recognize their voices? Well, maybe some of them maybe know but that does not helping! Hank and Harry were funny well it was their job to be funny in the film. We also have Kevin Dunn and Doug Savant, they were good but somehow aw f**ck it, they were all funny in their performances, it's like you are watching a film based upon a world where everyone is comedian except Japanese and the monster itself. To also mention Michael Lerner's appearance in the film as Mayor Ebert yep, you are right another slap in the face to the two famous, respected and hated critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, who obviously didn't like Roland's previous films.When it comes to the monster design, I won't lie to you I kinda liked it. It was an idea that Godzilla mutated from ordinary Iguana, but when you look at it, It doesn't even look nearly as Iguana. This Godzilla is more lean, to make him more faster and more well built for swimming. So it's not that bad. Overall, this is one large, imposing turd of a film. It's your opinion you like it, or you don't. And I do, because I think that the movie is very entertaining. But I do not include the humor in the film not all the time. I mean the script is just ridiculous, CGI is not bad, it's very good at some scenes, visuals are good, camera work – not bad, I like the underwater scenes, sound effects are brilliant, but I think the best thing is the music score by David Arnold, it's powerful and it presents monster pretty good. So no matter how amused I were it's still that's a lot of turdAnd one more thing Hollywood stop touching Japanese things",Godzilla
123,carlos37andre,139 freaking minutes,2,6 June 2020,"I don't know if I can find a single redeeming quality about this movie.It starts with a bunch of stock footage of lizards...? And, I'll get this out of the way fast, this thing is way too long, from the starts, the credits seem to be on the screen for like 5 minutes, is insane. It's just a bad way to start your movie.I didn't give a damn about any of the characters. The romance between Matthew Broderick and Maria Pitillo is just so poorly written. Why are we supposed to feel for her? We were told she dumped the guy, when he asked her to marry him, then in their first interaction in 8 YEARS she stoles from him and gets him fired! Wtf? How are we supposed to give a damn? And root for her? For them? I hated her character, I hated her camera friend, the only reason I didn't have Niko is because is Matthew Broderick, but I didn't like him either. And we have so much screen time to this whole subplot of Audrey wanting to be a reporter... my god, I hated this movie.Finally, Godzilla. Let's get another thing out of the way. He... gets bigger and smaller throughout the film, for some reason. Look, I get the bad CGI, sort of, it was 1998 (The Phantom Menace and The Matrix came out just a year after, but ok), the CGI is trash, the movie does not holds up, but man, how can't you not do the thing with a consistent size? I have to assume it is not that hard, since you are already doing a CGI monster. And again, so many weird things that go unexplained, where did he come from at the end? Was it another one? Did he come from the tunnels? How didn't anyone notice the body was missing from the bay? Since they specifically say they were going to get the body out of the water? What happened to that?Look, idk what else to say, but truly, the biggest flaw here is that this thing is so damn long (why having them basically kill it three times?) and also takes itself too seriously. And I mean, the mini Godzilla are eating popcorn at some point. C'mon!Almost forgot: It might be a nitpick, but in the first hour or so, they put place's name in the screen a lot! Like, some scenes character are somewhere, and you get a introduction, then you cut to another place (that's also introduced), and then again, you come back to the first place, that's introduced again!!! Why?! Are we that dumb?Anyways, the movie is bad, I wouldn't recommend it, it isn't even those movies that are so bad they are good. This one is just bad.",Godzilla
124,fung0,Emmerich is The Lizard King,9,27 February 2010,"I am AMAZED at how people constantly dump on Emmerich's Godzilla - probably his best-crafted film, overall, and a really sharp piece of entertainment by any standard.What more could you *expect* of a film by this title? This Godzilla is both a reverent remake and a very welcome technical upgrade of those silly Japanese films. Humor perfectly balanced against thrills. Better characters than usual for an Emmerich flick. Great action sequences, credibly embedded in real-world locations. Even a bit of sympathy for the big green lizard. What the $&%#@ else do people want???Oh, sure... this ain't yer Papa-san's Gojira. So what? Aside from the very first black-and-white film (and then only in its original Japanese version), that series was a joke almost before it started. Emmerich's Godzilla is a more athletic beast, but it's actually believable enough to be frightening, and it's got a personality that actually works. (Could it really hide down in the subways? Hm, let me get my tape measure... Oh, wait a minute: who cares??)I could have done without the Siskel-and-Ebert in-joke, but hey, Emmerich deserves a chance to have a little fun like the rest of us. And it balances out, anyway, against his hilarious use of the French secret service. (Why the French? Why *not*? In all those James Bond movies, why do the British always have to solve the world's problems?)I've enjoyed all of Emmerich's films enormously... though I do find Independence Day a bit hard to take. (Just a smidgen too much humor in that one.) Even 10,000 BC surprised me, improving a great deal on a second viewing. (A question of expectations; I was looking for a semi-remake of One Million Years BC.)These pure-entertainment, CGI-heavy films may seem trivial, but not a lot of directors can crank them out as reliably as Emmerich. He'll never be mistaken for another Fellini, but so what - the opposite is equally true. While I certainly do like to pull out La Strada or 8-1/2 every decade or so, I've watched my DVD of Godzilla at least a half-dozen times... it's an E-ticket carnival ride I'll never get tired of.",Godzilla
125,Mr_Censored,Pure Cinematic Junk Food.,6,6 April 2010,"In 1998, Godzilla got an American make-over by ""Independence Day"" director Roland Emmerich and audiences haven't stopped complaining since. Rather than make the atypical Godzilla film, Emmerich and his co-conspirator Dean Devlin took the ""Jurassic Park"" approach and turned the mega-monster into a really, really big T-Rex and instead of using aliens, bad weather or the apocalypse as an excuse to destroy a city, decided it would be best to watch the beast all but devour Manhattan. In the rain.The first thing that will likely hit you upon your first viewing of ""Godzilla"" is ""well, that wasn't so bad,"" but then you come to the ultimate conclusion that, well, it wasn't as good as it could have been, either. Emmerich, who surely knows how to turn out an entertaining popcorn flick (often at the expense of logic and character development) puts on a good show here, with solid special effects, fun chase scenes and lots of lots of destruction. Matthew Broderick takes the lead as a scientist brought in by the military to try and tame the savage beast. For the most part, the film works, but where it really falls apart is in some of its atrocious acting (Maria Patillo, I'm looking at you) drawn-out plot and it's seemingy endless series of endings. Seriously, the movie feels like it's over once it hits the hour and fifty minute mark, but intead overstays its welcome by becoming more ridiculous by the moment and not knowing when to stop.Perhaps a better editor could have tightened up the film and made it more enjoyable to the end. Hell, one can't imagine why Columbia Tri-Star didn't step in and take it down a notch, when most other studios are all too eager to trim big and bloated block-busters. Given the time and the patience, and with the right mindset (more specifically -- the mindset that is earned by checking your brain at the door) ""Godzilla"" is an overall entertaining film with its redeeming moments, but is perhaps one that could never live up to all the hype.On a side note, the film's famous ad-campaign featured the tagline: ""Size Does Matter."" Well, in spite of the innuendo, the film certainly supports that theory by proving that a film too big and too long simply doesn't cut it.",Godzilla

127,robsta23,Not Much Fun Like Independence Day,3,17 April 2015,"This is a really stupid movie, but I guess one could try to enjoy it if they think of it simply as a ""popcorn"" movie. sold tickets, but it lacks in quality. Why couldn't this live up to the fun provided in Independence Day?The first thing this film lacks is a solid cast. The only actor I really liked in this film was Jean Reno, and I guess since his character was quirky Matthew Broderick did an okay job. I cannot stand the actress who played Audrey, nor the character itself. Her character has no depth whatsoever, and seems to be placed into this movie simply as a love interest to Nick (Broderick). She is a really stupid character, asking bluntly if Nick is still mad for her leaving him, crying like a baby (seriously, it is so childish) when Nick leaves after she steals his tape, and offering the least sincere apology I have ever seen. And why are there 3 or 4 Simpsons voice actors in the cast? Hank Azaria's character can be funny at moments, but he definitely does not belong in this action flick.The CGI looks really bad, which is disappointing since Independence Day's effects didn't look too bad. That's all I have to say on that aspect.As for the pace of the film, while this movie brings Godzilla into play sooner than the more recent version, this movie is overly long for a monster movie. It takes forever for the movie to get to the second BIG fight with Godzilla where they fight him in the waters of Manhattan. This could have happened 30 minutes earlier and the film would have been on a good pace, but this movie insisted on playing things slow between each action sequence, though the action sequences can be long (especially when they get to Madison Square Garden) and somewhat fun to watch. However, if you examine the sequence with the babies hatching and attacking Nick and crew, it rips off a lot of shots of the velociraptors in Jurassic Park. The only difference is that these dinosaur-like creatures are taller.This movie had potential but fell very flat compared to that potential. I wish I could laugh at this movie like other bad movies, but to me this movie was just plain bad.",Godzilla

This is because the Godzilla here doesn't look like the real Godzilla at all, but more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. I just don't get why Hollywood so often have to make own versions that tend to be worse than the originals. Anyway, if you forget all the Godzilla-stuff, then this is an OK disaster movie. Taking place mostly in Manhattan, New York, I guess everyone can figure out what happens. The movie is entertaining and has some good special effects, but I think they should have ended it much earlier.

As a child I was completely thrilled by this film and even cried at the ending when I was young, but have since turned my back on to it after I read all these reviews hating it, what were they looking for, the meaning of life? Get real it's a monster movie. I finally picked up the Blu-ray and I must say it was still a blast, I recommend the Blu-ray, it enhances the action scenes very well. Sure the characters were mediocre and the dialogue is a hit or a miss, but I can look past that. The visual's still look decent and the special effects are cool to see. This film is not a Godzilla film, he is very different from the original, mainly he can be injured from missiles. I kind of like his design here, it's not bad. The ending was a set up to a sequel that never happened. But of course there was the animated series. I would have loved a sequel were he fought another monster. Comparing the two Godzilla's is a no brain'er, the Japanese one is superior in every way. I could go on for a few more paragraphs of talking about this, but instead I'm going to cut it short.

For once, audiences fought back, reminding the idiots that made this thing that people won't stand for s**tty movies, even if they do have special effects.  I've seen effects movies that actually have plots. The special effects in this movie serve as junk food for the brains, and are the only saving grace for the entire movie.

A survivor of a Japanese fishing crew was asked, what did he see, and he knew only to answer ""Godzilla"" because that's probably what he thought it was, but this survivor only saw a claw or a foot. It's clear this monster is not meant to actually be Godzilla, so the main mistake this movie made was naming the creature Godzilla. I saw it when it came out in Theaters back in 1998.

It all began in the 90's and Godzilla 1998 was one of the first blockbuster Science Fiction monster movies to start the trend. In an age where remakes are told in a newer and updated version there are those who still yearn for the prototypical creations that began yesteryear.This Godzilla is sort of a culmination of a giant monster action film and Jurassic Park. The characters are all familiar and likable. Throw in a love interest subplot along a plot involving scientific experiments gone haywire and civic corruption and you have Godzilla 1998. The special effects are good and there are some laughs. Godzilla the creature looks different than the earlier creations played by men in rubber suits. This Godzilla is actually a much prettier, sleek and elusive reptilian. He doesn't breathe gas or fire, but just simply leaps and swims in a lithe and sexy way. He doesn't even cause much destruction or human death. He just runs around in a leering and menacing way. He's actually rather pathetic since he doesn't cause much havoc, but rather gets enough abuse from gunfire and explosive rockets from the U.S. National Guard. The old Godzilla was a much more formidable villain as he destroyed many lives and buildings. The new Godzilla leaves mass destruction in his wake, but doesn't assume as many victims.

The first time I watched it though was when I was around four years young. It was one of the first, as I called it then, scary movies I watched.I actually will never find the strength to call this film horrible, even though my opinions on it have of course lowered a lot over time, because I watched it when I was so little, and I thought it was the best movie ever. This film is still really enjoyable, because it's value doesn't decrease as much as the person who watches it entertainment does, but it still sickens me to know it has such a low rating and many look down on it, while really it should receive more appreciation.I might have lowered my opinions on this film, but it is still a pleasing film that does not deserve the rating it has. I didn't see much of anything wrong with it, even now, and I just thought it was suspenseful and exciting, somewhat more suspenseful than a lot of other movies that have been made, with a lot of fun performances and excellent CGI. Godzilla, yet classified as a horror\suspense, was actually a touching film and was sad in some parts, as well. I will never understand how someone could hate a film that's just meant to be all around fun and enjoyment. It is still my favorite out of the original and newest remake.Two thumbs up for Godzilla.",Godzilla
137,thefan-2,He still looks like a man in a rubber suit,4,29 April 1999,"The special effects are amazing, and the action scenes of the monster thud-thudding through the streets of Manhattan chasing or being chased by humans are extremely well put together.  Matthew Broderick has just the right tone of amused irony. It drags whenever the monsters are off-camera, however, and that unfortunately includes one long section in the middle I wouldn't sit through again if you paid me.  The thing I liked best about the movie was the way the whole thing is shrouded in darkness and rain.  I don't expect many to agree with that, but it made it bearable for me. In fact, as the movie went on and I realized it was never going to clear up, my respect for the makers of this movie went up.  They probably did it to avoid having to show the monsters in broad daylight, and saved themselves a ton of editing thereby, but the effect when you watch it is of someone pulling off a deliberate stunt just for the sheer artistic fun of it.  The other thing I liked about it is the way the big monster still looks a little bit like a man in a rubber suit despite being a state-of-the-art computer animation.  A nice touch, which we can always hope was deliberate.",Godzilla

140,chvylvr80,and then Godzilla wept,2,3 September 2003,"I'm a Godzilla fan. So you can imagine my anguish at seeing Godzilla for the first time. Part of Godzilla's magic is that his movies are corny. A guy in a rubber suit fights other guys in rubber suits. Bad dubbing, bad music, and fun for all. Godzilla shouldn't have been made because what kills Godzilla, besides the fact that he looks like no Godzilla before him, is special effects. State of the art CGI is unwelcome in a Godzilla movie, and the production team of Devlin and Emmerich deserved a bomb after the undeserved success of Independence Day. The cast is disposable just like real Godzilla movies. New York takes a little beating and the army gets humiliated. Everything is in place except for the Godzilla that isn't. Bottom Line: This is a movie that should never have been made. That said, you shouldn't be seeing it.",Godzilla
141,metalrage666,A large pile of stinking fish sums this up perfectly,1,10 September 2016,"OK, despite all the money that this movie somehow made, this is pure garbage from start to finish. The story is as non existent as much as the acting. In retrospect almost everyone ever involved with this now regrets the final product. There's no point in me summarising the plot as it's been done and there isn't much of a plot anyway but I wanted to at least weigh in on why this is so abysmal. I've watched this several times and each time I'm left scratching my head over what the hell is everybody doing. It struggles to be funny with several running gags throughout the movie but they all come off as being lame attempts at cheap laughs. Like bad dad jokes they just get more and more annoying as the movie digs its own grave while trying to generate a laugh. I was never sure which was worse, the various cast constantly mispronouncing the name Tatopoulos or the head of the French secret service trying and failing to get a decent cup of coffee. There was just so much in this that never made any sense and the whole thing seems to be an exposition in how not to make a movie. I could never work out why the U.S ground forces in and around New York were all controlled by a bungling and inept Sergeant of all things; I'd expect a Lieutenant or Captain at least. Why would a worm scientist be the go-to guy for a reptile? Why not a reptile specialist? If you're in a helicopter and Godzila is chasing you, why fly straight? Why not go up? Why can't the French secret service speak English properly? Why do an Elvis impersonation under the guise that all Americans speak that way? And why would that fool anyone? How does a giant lizard manage to make it all the way to Manhattan, creating mass devastation along the way and not have the story leaked to any number of media outlets? If the tape of the first sighting was so security sensitive why was it left unsecured and in the hands of a civilian so anyone could get at it? Why would an animal as large as Godzilla assume that NYC, one of the most densely populated islands, is the best place to spawn after it's been relentlessly attacked since it got there and it's an unnatural environment? How would a lizard, regardless of size, know what a submarine is or how to destroy one using their own torpedoes? When the baby Godzillas are roaming around, why are they seen eating popcorn when their diet is mostly fish? The French guy is the one who's driving the taxi during a crisis and knows how to get to the Brooklyn Bridge! What's worse is that Godzilla also somehow knows where the Brooklyn Bridge is, manages to get there first and pops up in the right spot in order to cut them off! And it goes on and on like this and it never redeems itself until the credits start to roll. I can accept a big dumb monster movie but I'd still prefer it to showcase some kind of logic and have a plot worth following. I think everyone in this was miscast and for me that made the movie even more painful to watch. The combination of Godzilla destroying every building it touched or grazed against coupled with the whiz-bang U.S military gleefully destroying everything else, makes for good special effects but does little for common sense. This didn't have any of the essence of what gave Godzilla such a dedicated fan base in the first place and highlights that Hollywood directors should leave well enough alone if they're not going to be bothered with doing justice to an iconic character. It's little wonder they never ended up doing a sequel, it would've been like trying to remove glue from hair after this colossal debacle.",Godzilla
142,highwaytourist,"Excellent special effects, but that's about all",5,7 July 2013,"Some people hate this adaptation of the classic movie. While the film is tolerable, it certainly is a disappointment. The screenplay is the biggest problem. It's very derivative and predictable, yet has dumb characters and some poor dialogue. Parts of it obviously copy ""The Lost World"" and the scenes in the nest of hatch-lings are obviously copied from the raptor attack scenes from ""Jurassic Park."" Since the monster on the loose story has been done so many times, they should have had a few original ideas. In spite of all the shortcomings, the film has its good points. It makes good use of the New York City locations and has excellent visual effects that provide for a few good scares and chase scenes. It wasn't the worst movie in the world.",Godzilla
143,robertofuiano,Very Good,10,25 January 2008,"The reference to a possible rebellion of nature is certainly right. The danger of a revenge of animals against man is around the corner! The nature against technology. This is one of the best movies about Godzilla! Good, really Good. It has an origin mostly comic but has good special effects. It was inevitable to see negative comments here, is the norm. Cmq a good movie, the environments are good actors suited to the type of film. He certainly part ironic, comic, the environments are very well linked to those of fantascientific and the result can be considered as satisfactory. It is a shame that here there are elements that bring more than 7 film ridiculous as the army of darkness and films such as van helsing a miserable 5. Shame! I disagree with the standards is happening here, I am not convinced. In some cases there are good reviews, in other see that there are some 'too many prejudices against certain films!

144,twanurit,Main Titles are good,2,28 May 2001,"I haven't seen this since it played in theaters in 1998, but if memory serves me right, the title sequence was low-key and evocative, very well-done. But after that, the picture goes way down. Matthew Broderick is miscast horrendously as a heroic type, and Maria Pitillo is a terrible actress, playing an absurd character. As in ""Independence Day"", the producers start off with the attack, so that there's nothing really to climax. The Japanese Godzilla and his ilk and all those wonderful 1950s monster mashes always had the delirious rampages in the final acts. The film has an annoying rainstorm in New York City during most of the proceedings, and is almost always at night. Is this to cover up inadequate CGI effects? The trailer seen months before had the famous Godzilla roar, but here he looks or sounds NOTHING like the Japanese classic dragon/tyrannosaurus/stegosaurus. The creature breathes no fire, makes little sounds or even tramples buildings. He even disappears half-way through the film! The climax is assinine since a taxi can not outrun a 200-foot animal. Dreadful.",Godzilla
145,morganstephens512,not the worst,3,19 September 2017,"I will admit that while this film isn't that great, in fact it is bad, it's a lot better than people make it out to be. I mean I can see why people hated the Godzilla in it, I mean he looks sort of silly. I can also see why people would hate the fact that there is next to no character development in it. But in some cases, not many though, I thought there was a sort of clever moment. Or something funny like the line 'that's a lot of fish'. I also thought the effects were sort of decent. Far better than some other effects of movies that I have seen recently. So that deserves some points. The film is more boring than bad in my eyes. I never really saw it as bad but I was pretty bored throughout most of it. I will admit and I feel like I will be one of the few to say this but I thought that Matthew Brodreick (sorry if I misspell the last name) actually put up a decent enough performance. Enough to where I can feel some moments were he did a good job. Overall, still a bad movie but some parts and things that I liked. So I will give this a three out of ten",Godzilla

They are clearly far more interested in big CGI lizards and things going boom, and they can't even get those things right (the CGI, though technically impressive, does not look at all real).Think of all the films Wes Anderson could have made with this one crappy movie's budget, and weep.",Godzilla

""Where do he come from? Why is he here?""
""And it's Gojira, you moron!""Personal Anecdote:
Back in 2018 I visited Hawaii and went to Kauloa Ranch where they've filmed a bunch of movies like Kong Skull Island, Jurassic Park, Jurassic World and 50 First Dates.During our tour we stopped by a massive footprint in the ground. That footprint was from the beginning of this film when Dr. Tatopoulos was standing in the footprint.It was still dug out, just filled with water and was pretty weathered down.Review:
This iteration of Godzilla was trying so hard to be a Jurassic Park film. Honestly if you got rid of the title ""Godzilla"" and a few scenes with the iconic roar - I would have no idea this is a Godzilla film.Godzilla isn't even Godzilla. He's a T-Rex with a lavish title of the legendary Toho Kaiju. Nothing about him or his design is redeeming at all.The characters are poorly acted, they weren't even memorable.The dialogue is cheesy and bland and most of it was either militarily jargon or blatant exposition.The story was boring and dragged on for way too long. It kept getting more eye roll inducing as the story progressed. Also why were the French even in this? Only one person from that group ended up meaning anything and he didn't even get closure at the end?This film is just so uninspired and doesn't even pay the slightest respects to the source material in my opinion.",Godzilla
149,TheMovieDoctorful,"A Brainless, Soulless, Abomination",2,8 August 2015,"I REALLY hate this movie. Not just because it's a bad movie, though it most CERTAINLY is, but because of the mindset behind it. I love monster movies, but what I DON'T love is when somebody makes a monster movie SOLELY as an excuse to watch high octane action, explosions and apocalyptic destruction. ""Godzilla '98"" is a movie completely devoid of a single speck of intelligence or an ounce of heart. A movie with nothing to say, no deep themes to examine, no characters that compel you or grab your attention. Nothing but a 2 hour 19 minute destruction derby complete with bad jokes and bad acting.Matthew Broderick is UNBELIEVABLY lifeless and wooden as the film's lead Niko Tatapulous. I can't even say that I hated his character because he's just so devoid of any personality or identity that I can't bring myself to feel ANY emotional connection to him, positive or negative. The rest of the cast are pretty much a bunch of tokens; the token girlfriend without a personality, the token mysterious foreign guy (In this case French) without a personality, the token slimy boss without a personality, the token stereotypical New Yorker without a personality and so on. Apart from Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert and Lorry Goldman as his assistant Gene, (Who to be perfectly honest were the ONLY source of entertainment, comedy or joy to be found in this giant Kaiju turd) all of the performances in this movie are just devoid of care, interest or emotion. Even Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer (In perhaps the only role of his career where I would genuinely consider him to be not only annoying but ungodly so) and Jean Reno can't bring an ounce of life to this garbage. I honestly feel a little sorry for them.The script is one of the most paint-by-numbers, clichéd, lifeless scripts I have EVER seen. You can predict every single plot point and every single forgettable character's uninteresting arc from beginning to end. Gee, will Niko end up getting back together with his ex? Will the military save the city from Godzilla without any major casualties? Will token ex-girlfriend quit her job after getting fed up with her slimy boss? Will Mayor Ebert end up getting fired? Will the token French guy complete his quest to find the perfect cup of coffee? If you didn't answer a groaned ""Yes"" to all of those questions then please...Seek help.Speaking of the script, this movie is FILLED with plot holes. There are too many to count, and it's folly to go through every single one, but here is the big one; nobody can seem to find Godzilla in New York...How?! He's a giant lizard who leaves a pretty damn obvious trail of destruction EVERYWHERE he goes. Surely you'd be getting reports of his location like crazy wherever he was.But the worst thing about this movie, the absolute WORST thing that brings this movie down to a truly special level of awful is the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla. I don't mean his design, which I actually think looked downright awesome, or even the CGI, which I also thought was really, really impressive. I mean Godzilla as a character. In a GOOD Godzilla movie, Godzilla always has some kind of deeper meaning or social commentary behind him. Whether he represents the destructive nature of mankind with their nuclear programs, or vengeful Mother Nature reigning down on mankind after their destruction of the natural world, or even as something of a guardian angel that brings hope in times of fear. Godzilla in this movie has no deeper meaning. None whatsoever. All Godzilla is in this movie is a giant CGI abomination that merely exists to blow stuff up and cause as much destruction as possible. If Michael Bay's action scenes were a character, they would be the Emmerich's Godzilla.And finally, we have the ending. Many people have commented on how ridiculous it is that Godzilla was killed by the military, and how either he'd have to escape, or be killed by another monster. Those people are 100% right. Godzilla's death is anticlimactic, unemotional, forced and the King of the Monsters ends up going out like a pansy. ""Godzilla '98"" can't even get the SIMPLEST things right.I don't think I've seen such a clichéd, unoriginal mess take THIS little chances in years. There is nothing to remember, nothing to entertain you and nothing to compel or grab your attention. It may not be one of the worst movies of all time, but it is certainly one of the most soulless and unintelligent. The fact that somebody who didn't even like Godzilla was hired to direct the character's very first American movie downright disgusts me. Hollywood; stop making monster movies just to show monsters and destruction. Either have a point, have a story and have characters or leave the monsters we know and love alone.",Godzilla

152,jaredpahl,The Monster Summer Event of the 90s,7,7 June 2019,"A slick, Hollywood-ized version of a beloved Japanese monster, made to sell to a dumb American audience. Roland Emmerich's 1998 Godzilla serves as a specimen of 90s Hollywood excess. Big, loud, and brain dead. But Zilla (the nickname for this reimagined monster) also represents the fun, excitement, and spectacle of the summer blockbuster events of the pre-superhero era. I wouldn't call it smart, or even good, but Godzilla '98 is a great big ball of cheesy entertainment, and I kind of love it.Godzilla preserves the 1954 original Godzilla's nuclear backstory, but introduces a mostly original story and characters. Chief among the newcomers is Matthew Broderick as a scientist called on to investigate the strange threat from the sea. Also hanging around are Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, and Hank Azaria. All are enthusiastically up to the task of running with the mountains of special effects thrown around them. Now calling this story original is generous. At best it plays like a cheap rehash of Jurassic Park. At worst, it's just another monster movie. The kind of set-em-up knock-em-down script by machine that requires no thought and little engagement.And yet, I was engaged by Godzilla. Not by its ideas (of which there are none), but by its spectacle and its eagerness to thrill. What the ""all effects, no story"" complaints miss is the impact of truly exciting special effects. Godzilla has those. Emmerich and his technicians conjure some real awesome displays of scale, as well as complex CGI that still makes it point. The action scenes are carefully considered. Storyboarded, framed, and shot to be spectacular. It's an approach to action that is closer to that of the masters like Spielberg or Cameron than to the modern hacks who ship action off to the VFX team. There is a degree of showmanship found here that is nowhere to be seen in something like Kong: Skull Island or Pacific Rim: Uprising.Emmerich, along with Independence Day writer Dean Devlin, thankfully understand their audience (if not the OG Godzilla fans, then at least me). What I want from Godzilla is not heady sociopolitical philosophy. Nor is it half-assed attempts at human drama at the expense of the main show. What I want from Roland Emmerich's Godzilla is a roller coaster ride. A slam-bang fireworks show of hearty monster destruction. And this is what Emmerich has given us. The characters work. They are likable, sturdy human interests among the chaos. The effects work. The monster has a palpable presence onscreen. The action works. It's staged thoughtfully, and it's variety of locations and scenarios keep it from going stale (shout out to the Madison Square Garden section of the film. Running through the labyrinth of a basketball stadium while being chased by mini-Godzillas is one of the more exciting extended sequences of verisimilitude I can remember). All in all, the thing works as intended. It screams summer, popcorn, blockbuster, and all of the other words we associate with fun at the movies. I'm not supposed to like the American Godzilla, but damn-it-all, I do. I like the rainy, steamy New York atmosphere, I like Broderick's nerdy charm, I like the earnestness of its ultimate message, and I like watching a bunch of buildings get blown up real good. So sue me.75/100",Godzilla

It's got a big dinosaur that chomps things...things get blown up and crushed...and it almost has a plot. What more are you looking for with $3.95 clutched in your hand at the rental counter?This movie is more closely a remake of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1954), the movie which in most eyes actually started the Giant Monster genre (not counting the original King Kong of course).I'm a diehard Godzilla fan...and because of all the negative press, I didn't go see it in the theatre.

155,basilisksamuk,Product placement event,5,1 March 2013,"Gojirah, or Godzilla as he is known in the west, has always been a bit of an embarrassment to the rest of us Lizards. He likes to brag about how popular and well-loved he is in Japan but the evidence in the west is far from conclusive. Let's face it, Godzilla films are what you watch after 14 pints of lager and a chicken vindaloo, late on a Friday night on channel 4. If you hadn't drunk 14 pints of lager there wouldn't be any conceivable reason for watching a Godzilla film. Ever since I heard that Roland Emmerich was going to remake Godzilla my question has been – why? Now I've seen the film and I still want my question answered – why make a new, very expensive film about some has-been reptilian for whom we lost all respect many years ago? We'll probably never know.The plot, such as it is, finds Godzilla munching his way through Manhattan whilst Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and assorted military types try to hunt him down and kill him. There are two types of military involved – the usual Americans and the French secret service (guess who). Broderick is pretty good and Reno is too, though he only seems to ever play variations on his Leon character these days. Broderick's love interest, played by Maria Pitillo, (don't ask me, never heard of her) is very very irritating and sets back the cause of women's liberation by several decades. It's noticeable in this film that the women are all idiots. Mind you, so are all the men. A couple of the military guys are quite well portrayed but in general the characterisation is abysmal throughout.The film, like many these days, is too long. The first half hour in particular is so dreadful that I really thought about leaving. But then it picks up, at least in terms of action. The effects are pretty good though not the best I've ever seen. Godzilla being pursued by choppers through the Manhattan skyscrapers works well though when you stop to think about it you can see that they really are models and not skyscrapers. Godzilla chasing various folks through Manhattan is also good, especially the final chase. But I have to concur with the chap I overheard talking to his mate in the Gents after the film – ""I liked the bits with the little 'uns in best."" Yes, not content with one Godzilla, Emmerich also serves us up with several hundred freshly hatched Godzillaettes for our brave heroes to battle it out with.The egg scenes are pinched from the first Alien film, no question. (Godzilla's head is surprisingly like the Alien head too.) The flashlights used in these scenes even simulate the strobe effects in Alien. The little Godzillas are basically Spielberg's raptors but lots of them. Actually I think Emmerich does it better than Spielberg and the raptors, sorry small Godzillas, are the highlight of the film. As you might expect, Reno, Broderick and co walk unscathed through the raptors whilst minor French secret service types get eaten, even though they are not wearing red jerseys.Anyway, it was nice to see uncle Godzilla back on form. Don't bother turning up until the film has been running for 30 minutes, don't expect too much but enjoy the effects and the mini-Godzillas. Oh, and I bet you 50p that you can guess what the very last scene in the film is before it ever arrives.PS Please resist drinking Pepsi, buying a Swatch watch or renting a video from Blockbuster on your way home from the cinema. This film has the most blatant product placements I have ever seen and they really intrude in several key scenes.",Godzilla
156,possumopossum,"Stupid, Slow, and Not Godzilla At All",1,12 February 2007,"I watched this kind of hoping to see a new and improved version of Godzilla. I should realize by now that remakes are rarely improvements over the original. While Godzilla is wreaking havoc in New York City (?!!!!), a news reporter is saying, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have a dinosaur in New York City."" Was that supposed to be funny? I laughed my ass off when I heard that. And then the, ""Oh, man, you've got to be kidding! We are in his mouth! WE ARE IN...HIS...MOUTH!"" I don't know whether to laugh at this movie or throw something at the TV set. I tried to watch it tonight and fell asleep.Now, what is this crap? Godzilla, a male, is born pregnant. BORN PREGNANT! A MALE! BORN PREGNANT! I've heard of equal rights before, but this is ridiculous. I know the whole premise behind Godzilla is straining credibility, but this is just a little bit too much of a stretch.This is not the same Godzilla I came to know and love as a kid. This thing is a monstrous joke. Back to the drawing board, guys. 1 out of 10. Not even worth that.

Vastly superior to Independence Day anyways.",Godzilla
158,rcolgan,So bad that it took the God out of Godzilla,2,16 May 2014,"With the new Godzilla film being released in cinemas now, I couldn't help but think back to this 90's version of Godzilla. A film so poor that it is often called Zilla because people do not consider this film to be deserving of the name. But what made this film so bad? Well, everything. From the weak writing to the poor CGI there was nothing that made this film worth watching.But the bigger question is, how do you screw up such an easy premise? The concept of Godzilla is easy, a monster who causes havoc and destroys cities, often choosing to fight other monsters also. In this film however, the destruction that Zilla causes is minimal at best, as more damage is done to the city by the army. And this is probably the main reason people hate this film. If you can't understand the basic concept that the monster is supposed to destroy the city then don't make a monster movie.You can also go at great lengths talking about why none of the characters work at all. Broderick being bland and generic. Mario Pitillo being weak love interest who we never see any reason as to why the pair were interested in one another. And then there is the dreadful Siskel and Ebert parody which was a very weak poke at two of the greatest critics just for putting down Emmerich's films (which Ebert actually commented on stating that if Emmerich was trying to put them down on film they could at least have them be killed by the monster). But far more than anything else in this film we again think of how they screwed up the monster. He is a bland monster who lacks any character whatsoever. In the old Godzilla films the monster did have a personality with various fighting and death scenes having an emotional impact. The only way this one can have an impact is how we feel about it killing are beloved real Godzilla from the classic movies.Then there's the action itself. The destruction that Godzilla does cause is often off-screen with the film only showing us the aftermath such as badly designed destroyed building. Then when it does get to showing us the action (in those rare scenes) the effects are weak. In contrast to a film like Jurassic Park which came 5 years earlier using ground breaking special effects and making us believe those dinosaurs are there, Godzilla seems to do the opposite and do everything possible to show that it wasn't there. It would be difficult for anyone to believe that he wasn't computer rendered for a single frame with a weak design and incredibly unnatural movements.The worst crime this film commits is that it lacks a single moment to make this film worthwhile. It had no good action sequences. It lacked any funny moments. And it failed to create the monster Godzilla instead creating a bland generic monster who seemed to be coming off from the Jurassic Park hype, trying to rip of the film in every way possible with its monster. I can only hope that when I see Godzilla (2014) next week it's a better film than this and at least bares some resemblance to the character of Godzilla.",Godzilla
159,80sHorror,Underrated monster movie!!!,10,24 March 2017,"This is an intense and solid movie that was eclipsed by Jurassic Park and national news stories when it was released. It deserved more credit than it received and had it been released at a different time, it would have been a much bigger hit on the silver screen. This movie has awesome effects that are still good on a TV screen but are no comparison to how you would have felt in the movie theater with a huge screen. Even so, the movie kept us at the edge of our seats even on a little computer screen. The plot isn't like the Godzilla movies of old but actually makes sense in a scientific way as presented in this movie. It's a cliff hanger of a movie with characters you will like and characters you will want to smack. That, by the way, is a sign of a good movie when the acting is good enough to arouse emotions both good and bad. So grab the popcorn but go to the bathroom first because once this rocket ship of a movie takes off, you will hate to break the tension by hitting the pause button.",Godzilla
160,blazesnakes9,Godzilla is an disappointment.,2,11 July 2011,"Roland Emmerich, the director of Independence Day, directs the special effects blockbuster Godzilla, which grossed $379,014,294 in worldwide alone. It was the third highest grossing movie of 1998. Also Godzilla isn't good at all. At the start of the film, the monstrous Godzilla was created when nuclear fallout caused the lizard to grow enormous huge. After it grows as big as an house, the rampaging attacks an Japanese tanker and three fishing boats. Then, an scientist played by Matthew Broderick, come to investigated the tanker that was attacked. Aftrer that tanker, it heads to the Big Apple to wreck more havoc. Godzilla, then destroys most of New York City and its locals and residents are forced to evacuate. The problem with the script of this movie is that the characters don't reveal their background or their personality. Instead, the dialog is either screaming for help or commanding someone to let's go. Another problem is that this Godzilla doesn't even look like the original. This one looks like an giant lizard rather the title character. Godzilla is loaded with dumb special effects and stupid dialog that doesn't go anywhere other than making it. I would more impressed if this movie was more smarter for the screenplay of this mess. ★★ 2 stars.",Godzilla
161,ksj870,The Poor Man's Godzilla,3,23 July 2013,"I admit it, I used to be a fan. When this first came out in 1998 and I saw it on the big screen I had a blast. Sure, there were some flaws, but none of those kept me from having a monstrous good time while I was watching it that first time. But of course, I didn't have much experience with Godzilla, or Gojira, back then. Basically I had seen the animated series on Saturday mornings back in the 70s and a few excerpts of the Japanese films, and so I didn't really have much of a basis for comparison.But then the movie came out on home video and of course I bought it. Upon repeated viewings, some of those aforementioned flaws really became hard to ignore, so much so that I found myself wondering why I had such a high opinion of the film before. Then I actually saw some of the original Godzilla films, and I realized that in context, the 1998 American film is really just a poor man's version of the real Gojira.The filmmakers essentially throw out everything about Godzilla except the idea of a giant lizard. Unfortunately, there's more to Godzilla than that and the result is a pretty weak monster. Sure, this film's monster is still really big, but he's apparently not that powerful. He's not even bulletproof, which means that instead of wading through bullets and artillery shells like they are just so many gnats, he has to outrun them. Okay, let's think about that...we have a giant lizard as big as a skyscraper who manages to avoid taking any kind of direct hit from an entire army equipped with assault rifles, rockets, and big guns. Even helicopters can't get a clean look at him. Seriously? The idea that something so big can go most of a two-hour movie without being hit by more than a glancing shot is far more ridiculous than the concept of a nearly invulnerable monster. Moreover, once the new wears off, this Godzilla isn't really even all that spectacular from a visual standpoint. Yes, he's huge and reptilian, but he's also kind of spindly and he sort of hops around like an ostrich. And does he even breathe fire? No, of course not. That would mean he has to be something a bit more malevolent than an overgrown iguana. And that's really all this Godzilla is...just a mutant lizard like the ones living under my deck. Awesome? Not so much. And to think, all it takes to make Godzilla happy is a peace offering of fish. If only the Japanese had known this decades ago, imagine how much money they could have cut from the defense budget! At least Godzilla's mammalian rival, King Kong, had the good sense to demand a blonde.But the movie has problems even bigger than the eponymous monster. Some like to criticize the Japanese films for being too campy and cheesy, and some of them definitely are. But they've got nothing on this one. The characters we have to put up with in this film are, frankly, a set of losers. Not only do none of them engender the least bit of viewer sympathy at any time, but they are all about as likable as the stomach flu. Matthew Broderick is a poor choice for a lead in this type of film, but none of the other protagonists come off any better. The script forces all of them to say the stupidest things over and over again, and despite the fact that many of them are supposedly talented professionals in high-profile jobs they all come across like idiots from beginning to end. And really, what's up with all those major New York accents? The Yankee dialect is so thick that combined with the insipid dialog this film makes even the most badly dubbed of the Japanese movies seem like Shakespearean drama by comparison.I could keep going, but what's the point? If you've ever seen it you already know how lame the little raptor--er, I mean Godzilla clone--subplot is, how poorly the film's attempt at satire comes off (putting a caricature of critic Roger Ebert in the movie is a horrible misfire that says more about the filmmakers than it does Ebert, and I don't even like Ebert), and how weak the eventual climax is. The only thing this movie has going for it is scale and production value, both of which are indeed quite impressive. Some have said this wouldn't be such a bad movie if it didn't try to market itself as something it's not--a Godzilla movie!--but I think even that is an overly kind assessment. Even if the title monster were renamed ""Giant Fish Eater"" or something, it wouldn't help. The monster is weak, the dialog is laughable, and the characters are grating. This is just a bad movie, and changing the name wouldn't have solved it's manifold problems.",Godzilla

It didn't help that Matthew Broderick got the main role here.Continuing with the truth, no one could have helped this abomination of a film. I watched this movie back in the day while being underage, and I already thought that it was terrible.

Budget $130-150M; box office $379M.I do not understand why ""the critics"" are so dumb. Why do they like to hate so much? They must be very miserable people. This movie was awesome. Overall this was a cool, fun, and entertaining movie. I enjoyed it from start to finish. The plot was simple, straight-forward, and had a nice twist. The ending was good, although it felt sort of bittersweet. The French subplot was a bit odd and might have hurt the film a bit. The CGI/cinematography was great, and I loved the design and movement of Godzilla ""and the others"", except for a couple of very poorly animated CGI scenes (water splash and exploding building on fire). The screenplay/script was great and had some cleverly funny lines. The plot had a couple of cleverly funny scenes too.The protagonist (Matthew Broderick) started out weak but delivered better performance as the film progressed. I still cannot believe how he got away with never showing fear of Godzilla without hurting the film, or did he?. The soldiers showed the most fear, but the main cast did not show real fear (why didn't they?). I was confused about this but somehow this did not hurt the film for me. Maybe because this was not supposed to be a horror film?The orchestra music was fine and appropriate for the scenes and the ending song ""Come with me"" by Puff Daddy ft. Jimmy Page sounded good.Conclusion: everything about the film was good actually: the screenplay/script, cinematography, CGI, cast, orchestra, plot, slight comedy, ending, editing, directing, sound, etc. It was a great movie overall and I am glad I watched it again 20+ years after I first watched it. Do not believe the haters; this is a fun movie to watch.10/10.
-Below are some of my favorite lines from the script:32nd minute: ""There is footage we have that indicates a dinosaur is loose in Manhattan.""38th minute: ""Do you believe this? I don't know what's going on. You never know what's going on. Thank you.""53rd minute: ""What the hel* is the matter with you people? You've caused more damage than that godd*** thing did. Calm down sir, have some candy. Arrgg, I don't want any candy. Leave me alone!""75th minute: ""What's with the chewing? It makes us look more American.""
CGI/cinematography - loved it all throughout; except for two scenes: when Godzilla jumped into the water, the water made a tiny boring splash. And also, when a building is bombed the explosion was tiny and underwhelming.Plot complaints: 3 million people were evacuated instantly, which felt unrealistic. The real population at the time in that borough was about 1.5 million as a matter of fact. That real number would have been more believable to the audience and the critics. But even then, there should have been absolute mayhem and it was not shown in the film at all which was a huge missed opportunity to make the plot more believable and realistic. Also, the subplot of the French - I personally did not agree with that or thought it made sense because it was too unrealistic for a foreign agency to have bombs and military equipment in U.S. soil.Actors:
Matthew Broderick - (protagonist) - acting was poor at first but it got better and more acceptable as the movie progressed.Maria Pitillo - (the reporter) - acting was good enough; super beautiful too.Jean Reno - (the French) - decent performance, but I wish he had done better.Michael Lerner - (the Mayor) - excellent; funny character and great performance.Hank Azaria - (cameraman) - good enough.The supporting cast did decent.The end.",Godzilla
164,Asteri-Atypical,"Great effects, STUPID writing",3,26 May 2001,"This was the typical ""all flash, no substance"" 90's flick.While Godzilla looked and sounded great, the visuals of mayhem in NYC tickled the senses, the plot had holes bigger than those Godzilla himself was digging.As usual, the moviemakers ignored physics more times than one could count and set up the most fanciful scenarios.  Have you ever wondered what was holding up that suspension bridge when the cables snapped and were tangled around Godzilla?  How the car wasn't crushed in his mouth?  How that high voltage cable happened to be in reach and remain there long enough to be grabbed?That aside, I also hated the 'heroine'.  There was this attractive, interesting redheaded scientist available but the hero winds up with a woman whose only gutsy action was to selfishly and foolishly steal a tape? Argh!A last criticism would have to be that HELLISH music playing while the end credits rolled.  It had nothing to do with the movie and was nothing but low brow street rap.  What were they trying to do - clear the theatre as fast as possible?Oddly, the effects make this movie somehow enhoyable to watch, problems aside.  I just wish the creators didn't have to give us such dumbed down trash to go along with all that eye candy.",Godzilla
165,robert-259-28954,Piece of cinematic crap.,1,23 May 2013,"First and foremost, any reboot of this Japanese sci fi classic that would even THINK of hiring Matthew Broderick to play the male lead is going to be a rampant disaster. And this pile of junk certainly doesn't fail to fail. I've never seen so much bad acting in a major motion picture in a long, long time, and even a porno movie is more engaging, not to mention the ""pay off"" at the end! When I saw this overgrown lizard destroy a nuclear submarine because it apparently knew more about nuclear weapons and tactics with it's pea-brained Jurassic brain, I couldn't stop laughing. And when I saw 100's of it's 10' tall babies taking over Madison Square Garden, this piece of horse pucky REALLY got stupid. If you want to waste your time and your money, watch this turkey. If not, STEER CLEAR. If the original Godzilla could watch this monumental garbage, he'd turn over in his grave.",Godzilla
166,moviemattb,This is not Godzilla,2,14 August 2014,"Now I saw the original classic 1954 movie ""Godzilla;"" ""Godzilla: Final Wars;"" the 2014 ""Godzilla"" reboot; and now I have to see this. How was it? It was not the Godzilla that everyone remembers. This is not Godzilla. Today, many people that talk about this movie will refer to the monster as ""Zilla"" instead of Godzilla. The monster does appears in ""Godzilla: Final Wars,"" which it is now being part of the Godzilla universe. With that said, the movie was produced and co-written by Dean Devlin along side co-writer and director Roland Emmerich who has directed movies such as ""Universal Soldiers;"" ""Stargate;"" ""The Patriot;"" ""The Day After Tomorrow;"" ""10,000 B.C.;"" ""2012;"" and the classic popcorn entertainment ""Independence Day."" Emmerich has done a horrible job and he should never had directed this movie because he was not fan of any the Godzilla movies. Also, the look of the Godzilla looks nothing like the King of the Monsters that everyone loves and remembers. Oh, the CGI of God...oh, I'm sorry ""Zilla"" looks pretty much awful because it looks like that you would see on the Syfy channel. Although, there may be some practical effects but the CGI looks by far the worst. The story itself is horribly written, and some of the jokes don't work for example where Matthew Broderick's character looks at all fishes being putted together in a big pile, and turns to one of the soldiers and said ""That's a lot of fish."" How is that funny? Its not! Oh, even most of the cast that I feel sorry for are very much given a bunch of bad dialogues which makes most of the characters look stupid. I am not counting Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno because they are like the only two characters that I like, but at times might be given a bad direction. Same goes to Maria Pitillo, who is not only given a bad direction but a bad performance. However, I do feel bad for the actress, and I don't think she was that bad. Despite on what I say about giving most of the cast a bunch of bad dialogues and making characters look stupid I do say that the acting in this movie is not bad. I also don't mind the song that played during the movie's end credits ""Come with Me"" sung by Puff Daddy featuring Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page. Oh, I also thought spoofing Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert was very unnecessary because Emmerich did that intentionally because Siskel and Ebert never gave their movies a positive review. I know that many directors don't make movies for the critics, but they could at least just respect their opinion on a movie that they criticize on. Also, maybe just deal with criticism that whether he or she accepts it or not. I wish I can go on more about this movie, but everything else that many fans of Godzilla had already pointed out this movie on why this movie sucks. Overall, this is not Godzilla and it is not a fun popcorn entertainment as ""Independence Day"" was; but it is not the absolute worst movie of 1998 because I think the ""Psycho"" remake is the absolute worst movie of 1998, which I will review it for another time. For right now, stick with the original classic 1954 movie, and some of the other ""Godzilla"" movies. Even the 2014 reboot. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. Oh, and by the way, how dare they rip things off from an awesome classic Steven Spielberg movie of the 90s ""Jurassic Park.""",Godzilla

168,japamo,Pseudo-Godzilla is Still a Fairly Engaging Guilty Pleasure,6,29 September 2005,"If only the creature had only been named something else and not touted as the ""Godzilla successor"", the movie would have done much better.I saw the movie in a theater almost as soon as it came out in 1998 and I own a VHS copy. It's been about five years since I've seen ""Godzilla [1998]"" (hereafter G98), but I generally have favorable memories of it. No, G98 is not a masterpiece; it has its flaws, but it is far from being an abomination. The movie's major strength and flaw simultaneously is Pseudo-Godzilla himself(or is it herself-oh androgyny!). As a mythic force of nature, it falls short; it is vulnerable to heavier artillery, it is not wantonly destructive, and it deigns to stoop to Tatopoulos's (Matthew Broderick's) level (like a man wishing to communicate with an ant). As a super-beast, Pseudo-Godzilla is more impressive; it is extremely powerful, lithe, agile, clever, and tenacious in self-defence and of its raptor-like brood. I think the decision to cast Pseudo-Godzilla as a plausible animal with plausible animal behaviors, instead of, well, as a ""God Lizard"" was G98's major fatal flaw.When Pseudo-Godzilla is striding across New York, one feels a frisson of awe; he's so tall all you see are his muscular legs trampling across the street. But, the problem is, this Pseudo-Godzilla is apparently agoraphobic; he prefers to burrow and live in subterranean passages (although as an irradiated iguana, instead of say, a Gila monster, it's not really built for digging). Instead of terrorizing the world, all this titan wants to do is eat fish (again, not part of a herbivorous iguana's diet) and raise its young. Like a zookeeper using a steak to rouse a sleeping lion so the visitors aren't disappointed, Tatopoulos and the military employ fish mounds to entice the lizard to the surface. In short, Pseudo-Godzilla is not the supernatural monster summer audiences anticipated, but a simple creature that is monstrous only by accident.Therefore, in my opinion, I believe that to get the most out of this guilty pleasure of a movie, pretend that the creature is not Godzilla, but instead, say, the more prosaic Beast from 20,000 fathoms. Then one can appreciate the thrilling set-pieces more thoroughly. Also, to compensate for Pseudo-Godzilla's relatively scanty screen time, take the banalities the human cast utters with a block of salt, block any comparisons to ""Jurassic Park"" in savoring the infant Godzilla sequence, and commend Tatopoulos for his ruse in leading Pseudo-Godzilla to his Waterloo. I am aware this involves some ""intelligence dampening"", but again G98 was always intended as a roller coaster sensation machine, which it succeeds in being to some degree, certainly more so than the outlandish dubbed Toho schlockfests of the last four decades or so.In conclusion, to paraphrase a former acquaintance who saw G98 in the theater with me, it's not Godzilla, but it's fairly good.",Godzilla
169,mitchell5954,A Fun Underrated Monster Movie,6,10 February 2019,"Godzilla (1998) is an entertaining monster movie as long as you treat it as a film on its own and not relate it back to the other Godzilla movies. I saw Godzilla when I was a kid and was not familiar with the original films. I just saw this film by itself and had a good time. It has some good effects and good action. I did like some of the characters too. Matthew Broderick I think does a good job. He gets a lot of hate, but I did not mind him. I also like Jean Reno who plays the French soldier named Philippe. There are several problems, but I did ultimately enjoy the film.The plot is quite simple. Due to nuclear testing from the French one lizard mutated into a giant creature that comes to be known as Godzilla and is wreaking havoc across the globe until it finally reaches New York. The military enlist a scientist named Dr. Niko (Matthew Broderick) to help them stop the monster. Meanwhile the French military work under the radar to stop the creature in an attempt to make-up for their mistake.I already stated the things I really like about the film. I like the effects including the design of Godzilla. Many people hate the design but I like it. I like the action scenes, especially the ones in the nest. I also like Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno's characters. However, the film also has things I do not like. Firstly, I do not like Audrey, who is Niko's love interest. She comes off as annoying and unnecessary. The same can be said for her fiends Victor the camera man and his wife Lucy. They also come off as annoying and useless to the overall story. They are just the comic relief that was not that funny.Secondly I do not like how seemingly incompetent the military seems to be here. They attempt to take on Godzilla in the middle of the city which they can easily kill countless people and cause much collateral damage, which is exactly what they do. In fact, the military causes more destruction than Godzilla half the time. They cannot seem to land a hit on Godzilla with all their firepower even though he is the size of a skyscraper. Not-to-mention Godzilla gives them the slip on multiple occasions despite his size. A lizard the size of a skyscraper should not be that hard to spot.Overall, Godzilla is a fun action/monster popcorn movie. It has good effects for the time, great action scenes, and a couple decent characters. There are several moments that require you to suspend your disbelief. But if you can you should be fine. If you do not compare this to the original Godzilla films you should have a good time.",Godzilla

Ronald emmerich did a fantastic job directing this movie for lots of people who saw in 23 years ago. Now that I was introduced to it thanks to my dad who got me the dvd I get like I was seeing a newer movie that I never knew in my days .

172,smashattack,Strange combinations...,5,16 December 2001,"The combination mentioned above includes excellent CGI and cheesy acting. Also known as ""Godzilla"". When I first saw this movie in theaters I didn't really understand some of it and I was kind of uninterested in movies at the time, so I could have cared less in thinking about the movie. But I recently watched the movie again and realized just what happened. The special effects of this movie are astounding.  Godzilla fits in perfectly with his surroundings and interacts with the buildings and helicopters really well. What threw this movie into a terminal velocity speed fall was the horrible acting.  Maria Pitillo can't even cry correctly--she sounded like a dog being beaten instead of a distressed woman (I don't mean to sound insulting).  Doug Savant's character, Sergeant O'Neal, was nervous no matter the situation.  He never once spoke clearly, and acted like a frightened schoolboy rather than an enlisted man.  Hank Azaria tended to sound childish in some of his remarks.  Arabella Field overstressed the New York accent and sounded more like a cross between Olive Oil and Madonna. There are some exceptions to the horrible acting.  Matthew Broderick fit the part of Nick Tatopoulos perfectly and did an excellent job, as always. Jean Reno played well as Philippe Roache, and seldom a moronic word came from Vicki Lewis' mouth. You can tell most of the actors are just that--actors, nothing more.  It was as if half the military personnel had no idea what they were doing or how things worked or how military personnel were supposed to act. All in all, this movie isn't a complete waste of time, thanks to the great action and CGI effects involved.  It was a really well put together movie if the corny actors are discarded from further thought. And it's much better than seeing a psychotic man in a cheap monster suit thrashing at little model buildings.  This American version is worth more than, say, Godzilla 2000.  The creators of the movie took an overseas idea and made it so much better, but somehow forgot to take out the dense acting. Let's hope that the casting will be a little more thought out if there are any more Godzilla movies.",Godzilla

174,pumpkinhead_lance,Excellent underrated G-Flick **** out of 5,10,9 February 2005,"It's been almost 7 years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you, when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't disappointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people (and Godzilla fans) that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's ""Godzilla"".There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' at least, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you, you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about, after all.And what was wrong with the monster itself, Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in a lot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being a laugh-fest at the theaters.What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original, that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts, but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got a lot of attention, unfortunately, and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy it for what it is.This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects, there's nothing quite like it.So take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as ""GODZILLA"".",Godzilla

With Roland Emmerich you know your going to get a decent disaster movie which will be explosive, witty and be a complete popcorn flick. Godzilla is no different.

It came on two nights ago so I figured 16 years has passed so why not watch it with a more critical eye. From the very beginning when Broderick was approached by the identified men in the helicopter and transported to the Philippines, I lost interest. The men in the helicopter were supposed to be mysterious and authoritative and coercive, instead they looked like 2 badly dressed Hench men. Broderick is shown the initial footprint made by Godzilla and it looks like a colossal lizard foot print, then they fly over a trail of other footprints that look like they were made by a chicken? 0_0 All the characters sounded and acted the same; like a bunch of bumbling idiots. I felt like I was watching an episode of the Three Stooges. Maria Pitillo was the worst offender; she was the dumb, vapid blond who always had this look on her face like she was constipated. Behold Godzilla reveals himself and he is a T Rex? Wait a sec now I'm watching Jurassic Park? You're telling whoever is responsible for the CGI could not come up with a more original looking creature? This mess of a movie is not even suitable for TV. It was unoriginal, uninteresting and uninspired.",Godzilla

I know a lot of people, namely Godzilla fans, always daydreamed or imagined Godzilla chasing a cab around the Big Apple, and that's what we got, in a very satisfying way.  I felt Godzilla did everything I would have wanted him to do.  The movie was a bit more satisfying than ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"".  Although the movie does have it's faults: the characters aren't interesting, and the cab chase, although very enjoyable, seems out of place.  When Godzilla first arrives in New York, it's interesting how Emmerich uses the camera to film his arrival. Only showing his legs.  It's a great touch.  In the end, I was satisfied with the action and the special effects (way better than Independence Day's, although ID4 was a bit more enjoyable), but not with the characters.  *** out of ****.",Godzilla

Well, honestly, leave it to Roland Emmerich to make another terrible big-budgeted film. Yes, the guy that made Independence Day, and although it is hard to believe it earned a LOT of money in the box office. This movie is totally overrated and they just made a fool out of Godzilla.

The giant lizard has been transformed from a man inside a bad lizard costume trampling model buildings, into a menacing modern-day beast literally causing NYC sidewalks to buckle under his feet.  This is all fine and good, but who cares?The performances are stale and ridiculous and the script is the kind of simple stuff you'd find written in a children's book.  Not one person can save this multi-million dollar floppola. There are no surprises, no twists, and certainly no characters that make you care whether or not they live or die.

There are ideas lifted straight out of other films such as 'The Lost World' and the whole thing reeks of commercialization with its digs at Disney and other such companies.  The wafer-thin plot is down there with the worst of the Japanese Godzilla films and the film is very over-length.  The monsters here are computer-graphics, and it shows - they're just so bereft of character or realism.  The big creature is barely visible through the grey skies and rain and its face, complete with Desperate Dan chin, makes it look comedic rather than frightening.

The plot, such as it is, involves an iguana mutated by French nuclear testing.  The giant lizard instantly makes for the heart of a city to lay its eggs.  Slightly odd behavior.  The 'storyline' is down there with the worst of the Japanese series, the characters are all just cardboard cutouts of the kind usually found in bottom-of-movie-barrel Friday the 13th-type slasher films, the plot is ridden with holes and there is a stunning lack of originality, the producers having lifted ideas out of everything from Jurassic Park to Aliens.  The big monster itself is hardly visible through the rain and grey skies, but maybe that's for the best seeing as it looks so ridiculous with its gangly arms and legs and Desperate Dan chin.  The baby monsters are just laughable, obvious CGI creations.  There's no sense of awe or danger in the film, it's all just one long vehicle for CGI effects which often fail to seem real.

The characters are all cardboard cut-outs, the monster has no character at all and its offspring are quite obviously CGI creations.  The humour is also pathetic.  A fat man who is constantly eating and has to often be stopped from doing so?  A dated concept which belongs in uninspired cartoon strips.  The contempt for Godzilla fans and the audience in general is obvious.  This film is more of an advert than entertainment, all the tacky merchandise having been prepared in advance.

Highly hyped and highly anticipated, this movie was an absolute disgrace to movie making. The best way to describe this one is that Godzilla shows up and then a bunch of stuff happens. Nothing in this movie made any logical sense. I think this is the second movie that I felt like getting up in the middle of and leaving (the first was Mortal Kombat 2). At no point in this movie did it look like Godzilla was in the city of New York, all the buildings that Godzilla was running by or through look the same. The computer effects were horrible and Godzilla himself looked horrible. Half way through it it turns into Jurasic Park's raptor scence. This is another movie thrown together for the sake of making a movie. They hype the movie, made a good trailor for it and throw in a half decent sound track and a load of merchandise to take advantage of all the naive, less eduacated citizens of this country that work hard for their money. If there is such thing as education than this has to be the opposite. This movie kills brain cells and there should be a health warning on it. Absolute idiocy.",Godzilla
188,knsevy,There oughtta be a law...,2,20 November 2001,"There oughtta be a law that says, if you purchase the rights to a recognized entertainment franchise for your own use, you are required to USE THE REAL PRODUCT, OR AT LEAST TRY TO REPRESENT IT. This is TriStar buying a famous monster's name and then trying to use it to sell a totally different monster.Not that this is necessarily a bad monster. Heck, I actually LIKED the monster, even if they are just animating the Jurassic Park 'raptor' model on a macro scale, especially for the baby monsters.The point is, this is obviously not Godzilla, not by any stretch of the imagination. They don't even take the time to explain WHY the beast is CALLED 'Godzilla' (or actually, 'Gojira', as they take enough time to make a lame joke about). The solution: don't call the movie 'Godzilla'. Give your new monster a new name and put the movie out.Still, even if they HAD done this, it would have been a pathetic movie nonetheless. The monster, interesting though it was, is a big part of this problem.GINO (Godzilla In Name Only), as the monster will hereafter be referred to, simply doesn't seem to exist. Yes, the rubber-suit Godzilla was hokey and campy, but he had some stage presence, for crying out loud. GINO is nothing but a special effect. Since it can't actually be filmed against a real background, even a campy miniature of downtown Osaka, it never gets the chance to truly interact with its environment. When your audience can't believe in your title character, your movie fails.Another little suggestion for future filmmaking: either DO, or DON'T. I'm referring here to the tacked on 'fire-breathing' scenes that appeared twice in the version I saw. Being a longtime Godzilla fan (the real one), I was involved in several discussion groups and online lists while this movie was in production. One of the questions that kept recurring was, 'Does the new Godzilla breathe fire?' The answer we finally got from the source was 'No, it does not,' but they didn't have the guts to stick by that. In a pathetic attempt to win the true Godzilla fans over, they spliced in two post-production scenes of Gino bending low over burning debris and apparently just exhaling forcefully enough to LOOK like it was breathing fire. Bad, bad choice.Speaking of bad, bad, how about that dialogue? How hard IS it to pronounce 'Tatopoulis', anyway? It's a FOUR-SYLLABLE-NAME. It's not even a remotely challenging Greek surname, so the attempt to make a running gag out of it falls as flat as the acting itself.This movie can't be fairly compared to the Toho Godzilla series, because the two are totally different. Apples and oranges, as the saying goes. However, taken on its own merits, TriStar's 'Godzilla' is still pathetic.",Godzilla

And as the previews started rolling, I honestly thought I could at least not hate it.But lord, what an awful movie.In a movie like this, the special effects are supposed to be the driving force.  Let's just say that we've seen the same effects, and better, elsewhere (""Jurassic Park"" comes to mind pretty fast).  Once you lose those, there isn't all that much else.  The dialogue is laughable, the performances are tremendously wooden, and the cutesie cameos and bits elicit more groans than grins.Forget ""wait-for-video"", this movie is ""wait-for-it-to-be-two-for-a-buck-at-Wal-Mart.""",Godzilla

I didn't go in looking for ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""The Sound of Music"" (ugh!), or ""American Beauty"".  I went in looking for a summer blockbuster in the ""ID4"" & ""Jurassic Park"" tradition.  What I got was a summer blockbuster in the ""ID4"" and ""Jurassic Park"" tradition THAT WASN'T AS GOOD AS EITHER.Special effect movies are like a drug, anyway--the next high has to be better than the one before.  In this case, said high didn't even come close. ""Jurassic Park"" had my pulse pounding a lot harder than ""Godzilla"" did, or could.  When you have worthless effects in a special effects movie, you're in trouble.The plot was not only derivative of movies, it was derivative of BOOKS.  The whole find-the-hidden-nest thing is straight out of the end of the novel version of ""Jurassic Park"" (the sequence didn't make it into the movie). The numerous rip-offs from other films would be fine IF the creators were trying to do a spoof, as Wes Craven did in ""Scream.""  As it is, they're just betraying their creative bankruptcy and hoping we won't notice.  I go to movies to be entertained, not insulted.That leaves the acting, and I'm sorry, but even in effects movies it should be less pathetic than they are here.  Take Laura Dern in ""Jurassic Park"" and Maria Pitillo here--is there even remotely a comparison?  The ""Star Wars"" scripts were equally clunky, but Harrison Ford never phoned in a performance the way Matthew Broderick does here.  Jean Reno is tolerable, but only just.All in all, ""Godzilla"" has very little to recommend it.

192,parhat,Godzilla in Name Only,4,3 October 2005,"The movie would vastly improved if they don't name this movie Godzilla. They can call the movie Mutations, or some other names. So the name really hurt the movie. As a movie goer, you will expect certain fidelity of the original Godzilla.This is true whether you talk of the movie Superman, Spiderman, Batman, or any other movie that is a remake. The movie is remake from a popular series because there was something people like about the character which absolutely had nothing to do with the name. The big name will buy you box office in the first couple of days, after a week it is downhill. If the director and producer would get the idea that a remake is not reinvent. Also Dean Devlin completely forgot people watch the movies not for special effects, they come for the movie because of their strong identification with the character of the movie.For original Godzilla, people love the stupid dumb bumbling beasts who are indestructible from man's own sins and he is punished. That is basically the psychological attachment we have with the character. The feeling of pity we have for the monster, much like Hunchback of Notre Dame, or the Beauty and the Beast, well, you get the idea. The concept and character of this beast is within the bounds of a classic story while the movie Godzilla (1998) had none of those classic story identification. It is very close to a cheap copy of other movies from George Pal's movies and other similar American made movie without any character identification. As a professional screenwriter the most important factor in a successful writing is the strong identification of character where the audiences strongly identifies with his thinking, philosophy or other things. If there is none, then it is just nothing but a fantastic mindless SFX movie without any cult following.Cult following needs a certain element of identification, Star Trek (utopia), Time Tunnel (be part of an important events), Matrix (choice of reality), Casablanca (personal bitterness versus greater good), Dr. Strangelove (the inevitably of destruction), and Godzilla (man's sin will be punished). All these hidden meanings not mentioned in the movie is what gives movie its magic. Take for example Godfather, there was absolutely no mention of the word mafia, and the writer and the director made sure of that fact. Because these concepts lurks in our darkest corners, the psyche is very powerful.If you WANT to enjoy the film rename this movie or put in a new label and call it ""Jurassic Park 6"" and you will find it tolerable to watch, and enjoy the movie. If you have not watched original godzilla before, then this is good news, because this is a blockbuster movie.

The characters are not important in this movie, but they sure are bad! Maria Pitillo should get an award for worst AND most annoying performance in an easy role to play.

196,alexcomputerkid,"This is ""guilty pleasure"" fun indeed.",6,12 May 2014,"In 1954, the new film ""Godzilla"" hit the theaters in Japan and made an impact that nobody foresaw or thought would have happened. Sure, in 1933 the famous King Kong was released but Godzilla was still an inspiration for many monster films to follow. These movies include the classic 1954 movie, ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and even more recent films including the 2006 South Korean film, ""The Host"" and ""Cloverfield"" from 2008. So many monster movies world-wide have been inspired by the original Godzilla movie.In my mind, around the 1990's, we were long overdue for an American Godzilla film for many years. It is true that in 1956, there was an American production of Godzilla, King of the Monsters! but it had mostly the same footage from the original Godzilla to introduce the monster Godzilla to an American audience. It would seem that a new American version would surely find an audience in the States and create a new audience so to generate sequels.In 1998, an American version of Godzilla was indeed released. It came with a risk because of the past history of Godzilla movies and it also needed a big budget to properly depict this large monster. In the end, this movie version of Godzilla is mostly hated but I was able to look past this.After a sudden and mysterious attack on a Japanese vessel and also some big footprints found in the Panamanian forests, Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is contacted by the U.S. State Department who discovered a giant mystery which a monster we later called Godzilla and who's main target for attack is the Big Apple, New York City. This is an attack that later turns into much more.At the time of the movies release, director Roland Emmerich was coming off the huge success of Independence Day and there was much hype surround this film because of that. He brought Matthew Broderick in for the lead role but I believe Broderick is a questionable lead because he has never been the action film actor and his inexperience in this genre shows in this movie. Emmerich also casts popular television actor Hank Azaria as Victor Palotti as a funny guy but he mostly meanders around and is not very funny. Maria Pitillo is the love interest of Dr. Tatopoulos but her acting here is a mess and she gives some clear reasons as to why she's not around in films any more.At first glance, it seems like this is a simple plot but the plot does have some substance. Even though New York City comes off as a simple setting, the film does give us many interesting shots of the city during it's action scenes. The action scenes don't really stand out and the ending is tiresome but the action here is enough to get by. Popular actor Jean Reno plays an very interesting French secret agent which adds a foreign spy angle to this new Godzilla.What's becomes even more interesting about this American remake is the Godzilla creature itself. Godzilla sure looks like a dinosaur and that maybe is understandable considering this film was made during the heights of the popularity of Jurassic Park. The special effects here are hit or miss. The film does sets itself up perfectly for sequels but these were late canceled due to the poor audience reaction to this movie. There is also a baby element which later turns into a type of biology lesson that involves asexual reproduction. As you can see, the substance of this movie is kind of all over the place but it sure does add some elements to a film that could have easily been too simple.In the end, this is a somewhat standard Roland Emmerich film. The movie is very dumb at times and has many problems but in the end Godzilla works in a cheesy kind of way. This was a silly action film from the 90's that I wish had found it's audience. This is ""guilty pleasure"" fun indeed.",Godzilla
197,Ripe Peach,"By the time it picks up pace, it's hard to care.",1,16 December 2002,"If you were just to watch the last hour of this film, you might be able to convince yourself that it's a tolerable whole.  But there are simply too many flaws to make the entire experience enjoyable.The biggest problem is that it's simply too dull at the start.  Revealing the creature bit by bit is a classic device; unfortunately, the massive hype, endless trailers and ubiquitous merchandise utterly ruined the attempt.  Nobody watching this film is in any doubt about what Godzilla is going to look like, so holding out just seems like a mean spirited way to save on the FX budget.While the main Godzilla FX are superb, the Godzuki raptors are inconsistent and a little blue-screenish.  They also seem to be suffering from a strange disease where they can easily smash their heads through windows and steel doors, but seem unable to drag the rest of their bodies through.  This gets tiresome very fast, and the other thing that drags this sequence down is that it's so obviously ripped off from Jurassic Park that it becomes painfully intrusive.As a pet peeve, the military hardware in this movie really annoys me. Hollywood seems stuck somewhere in the 1950's as far as technology goes. Every single weapon or vehicle in this film is badly - and deliberately and wilfully - incorrect, and the continuity is shoddy: note how many times aircraft fire off their ""last"" missiles.  The reason that this annoys me is that there ARE weapons that do everything the scriptwriters wanted.  If they'd done TWO MINUTES of research, they could have found them.  That they didn't bother to do that says a lot about how seriously they take their job. Add to that the fact that they couldn't even be bothered to invent a plausible excuse for some of the idiotic snafus (why can't the helicopters fly UP?) and it becomes plain insulting, and makes it very hard to suspend disbelief.The actors in this film are irrelevant, and so it really doesn't matter that they range from mediocre to insipid, and that they have lines so trite that they would make a five year old blush.  Honestly, it doesn't matter, so try to get over it.On the bright side, the score is acceptable.  It's blaring, but it does match the action.  The sequences are well lit and shot, and there's a definite big budget feel to everything (except the cast).I really do think that this is close to being the best possible Godzilla movie that Hollywood could make.  Unfortunately it's a dull, patchy, soulless, derivative, irritating snoozefest with exactly zero unexpected scenes or twists.  It's the perfect example of how to make a zero-risk film by committee, and given that it made it's money back and more, it did exactly what it needed to do, which is to pander to the sheeple that make up multiplex audiences.Well done Hollywood, you've managed to lower the bar another notch.",Godzilla
198,TimBoHannon,What Were They Thinking?,6,10 August 2008,"I rarely include a spoiler in my review unless it is impossible to discuss what I want to without one. Most of the people who bash this movie are off base. What occupies the screen more than suffices. The characters are lacking, but not cardboard or boring. The dialogue is bland but never bad. The visuals are awesome. Nobody uses scale and lighting to create tension better than director Roland Emmerich. He is one of the great action directors of our time. The problem is what we never see. It is a colossal, titanic, mammoth, astronomical and gigantic omission.Many people assert that the script is dumbed down. It is not. ""Con Air"" is dumbed down. ""Charlie's Angels"" is dumbed down. ""Batman and Robin"" is dumbed down. ""The Avengers"" is dumbed down. ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is dumbed down. I have not seen ""Armageddon,"" but judging by what I have read, it is the epitome of dumbed down.The ""Godzilla"" script makes sense and moves with clarity. It does not jump right into the action. Godzilla does not make an appearance until 25 minutes into the movie and we do not see his face until the 45 mark. The plot is simple to follow, and the main ideas and numerous developments are repeated in conversation. They also hold up under scrutiny. Roger Ebert raises many questions, but is wrong on the details. He questions why Godzilla fits into a subway tunnel. He does not. He burrows under it. We even see him do so later on. Ebert sees many movies so mistakes do happen. Speaking of Ebert, the mayor of New York and his assistant are patterned after him and then-partner Gene Siskel. I happen to like Ebert, but he was a grouch towards Emmerich's first two blockbusters: ""Stargate"" and ""Independence Day."" ""Godzilla"" invests a lot of time into its humans. There are four separated from the rest in the credits: Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), the expert on Godzilla; Philippe (Jean Reno), a Frenchman with initially mysterious motives; Audrey Timmonds (a hot Maria Pitillo), a reporter with ties to Tatopoulos; and 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria), a cameraman who wants to help. Broderick and Pitillo fail to bring enough life to their characters. Pitillo cries in once scene, but the angle and lighting of the shot prevent me from seeing if her tears are real. Reno and Azaria inhabit the most distinctive roles in both writing and acting. Kevin Dunn plays an unusually smart military leader who makes Andre Braugher (""Rise of the Silver Surfer"") look like a cadaver.The Omission: Godzilla's signature weapon, note the word *signature,* is the atomic beam he emits from his mouth. The beam is intensely hot and causes explosions upon impact. It is not fire; Godzilla is not a dragon. King Kong's size engenders fear, but Godzilla stands six times as tall. Nevertheless, *his beam* sets him apart from all other monsters. I watched ""Son of Godzilla"" as a child, and was awed by his neon blue ray. I was too young to see this ""Godzilla"" in theaters, but when I remembered and rented it, I eagerly awaited the atomic breath.*It never came!* Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (writers, producer, director) try to fool the audience that the movie is over. I am sure many people fell for it, but I knew there was more to come. ""It couldn't be over,"" I thought, ""I have not yet seen the ray!"" I felt disbelief when I realized it was not going to come. Devlin and Emmerich stripped Godzilla of his most popular and distinctive quality, and cheated the audience of what most of them desired.The atomic breath had been used in 22 movies by that time. I love Devlin and Emmerich. ""Stargate"" is solid sci-fi entertainment. It spawned two television series with a combined 15 seasons and counting. ""Independence Day"" is the most stunning movie ever made. Twenty-two movies and cultural legend status is a lot of history. This is not their original material. Nobody, not them, not even Alfred Hitchcock, has the right to alter Godzilla. ""Godzilla"" could easily be a nine, but scores a six of ten instead.",Godzilla
199,Mike Astill,"More fun than The Phantom Menace (that's not saying much, but still...)",7,10 April 2002,"On its release, the reviews of Godzilla were depressingly predictable. Excited by pre-release, 'Lost World' bashing hype (the museum trailer is still one of my favourites of all time), a great number of people were obviously disappointed that this was, well, just another monster movie.I have to wonder what these people expect to see when they go to a film like this? I, personally, don't enjoy British gangster movies, so I don't go to see them. If you don't LIKE monster movies, why go and see one?Godzilla is a monster movie. Devlin and Emmerich obviously know the rules for making monster movies, and follow them religiously. Hence, you have a close encounter with the beast, then you're introduced to the ensemble cast of dopey but likable stereotypes (none of whom are the star, naturally), before the creature emerges from the deep to stomp through a famous city and lay it to waste. The effects are great, the musical score is a blinder, and there are more than enough memorable scenes of monster-mashing mayhem to keep this G-Fan happy. It's certainly more fun than Phantom Menace or either of the Jurassic Park sequels. You just can't win making a film like this unfortunately, as so many people are going to immediately turn on it for reasons of their own. It's a shame, as I for one would like to have seen what they would have done with a sequel or two. Oh well, back to Japan for the Big G. At least they love the big lug over there.",Godzilla
200,Tyson14,*sigh*,4,12 August 2014,"The biggest issue with this film is its title. If they so much as removed Godzilla's name from it, it would be an acceptable piece of trash. But by having the Big-G's name slapped on the posters/DVDs, what we have is Godzilla's anorexic cousin destroying the king of the monsters' reputation. How do they ruin Godzilla? Well, he doesn't even breath fire (that's like Spider-man not shooting webs), his origins are about as throw-away and unimportant as can be (considering the original Godzilla's metaphor, I feel his origins should NEVER be shrugged off), he doesn't battle any enemies and he's taken down by a taxi and a couple of jet missiles?!?! What?! I thought he was created by nukes! From miscasting (with the exception of Reno), to a lot of uninspired FX work (with the exception of the scenes before Zilla is revealed - after that, it just becomes a Jurassic Park rip-off), I personally don't see how this film can be enjoyed even when set aside from the original Godzilla universe. It gets lost in its own logic and expects its audience to be dumb enough to go along with it (giant lizard just disappearing? Come on!) Even for a Godzilla movie the characters suck... big time. In Toho's original Godzilla series our human characters were a majority of the time cartoony, yet had a certain charm and never got in the way of the beasties at hand. Heck, there's plenty of Godzilla films with real genuine characters that make this remake seem like it was written by a 6-year-old.What is nice is that Toho has actually tried to redeem the American Godzilla. In fact, he's now dubbed just ""Zilla"", as he's unworthy of ""God"" in his title. In true Godzilla entries like GMK (arguably Godzilla's best ever sequel) or Godzilla: Final Wars, they actually include ""Zilla"" into their story lines and explain that he's basically just a tuna eating lizard the Americans mistook for the real Godzilla. Pretty neat? ""Zilla"" actually goes up against Godzilla in Final Wars, and it's one of the most satisfying fights ever! This shows just how hard Toho tries to please their fans.However, to get back on track, I'll say that if you're unfamiliar with the original Japanese Godzilla films, then you're justified to like this movie. On the other hand, you really need to check out the originals. There are some Godzilla films that surpass this, and any Michael Bay film, both in terms of adrenaline pumping action and even heart.The best I can honestly say about this film is Zilla's roar is great... And I suppose the soundtrack was alright (even if there is no trace of the classic Akira Ifukube theme)Thank god Legendary got it right with their 2014 remake!",Godzilla
201,bullions27,Metric tons of utter c***,3,11 November 2000,"*Spoilers* Like it'll take a genius to figure out this movie.This movie deserves to be insulted as much as the nonsense silliness TPM brought us. Then again this is the same crew that brought us Independence Day.Godzilla is what every big action director dreams of. An idea that is just too good and perfect to go sour packed with all of today's finest technology and SFX. It's an instant money maker, or you get cow dung like this product.The plot is so simplistic it's even funny! A typical minute lizard gets bombarded with radiation from a nearby nuclear explosion and presto instant giant lizard. Years have gone by and so has the explanation how it got to be where it is now and it needs to find a suitable place to lay eggs. By sheer luck it chooses the Big Apple. What better place to destroy and have your babies? Enter Mathew Brodeick the scientist to save the day.This movie defies intelligence, even the slightest. There were so many questions raised from this film, and we're not talking the ingenuity of the plot here. How does this mockery of Godzilla gets so huge and yet so small in different scenes? When did it acquire this ability to change size? Why was it so conservative of it's nuclear breath? Why did missiles from fighters kill it after all that ammunition and weaponary including missiles dumped on it earlier only annoyed it? Here's a lesson  for you, do some research on the subject before spending your generous budget on garbage.The acting, well, that's what they can do best from the c*** they were given. I mean if you look at it after watching it once, what story was there that you need Grade-A performances? I particularly detest their attempt to ridicule Siskel & Ebert with that pitiful gag in the movie. What credibility do they have of their past movies that would even give them the right to say what they did were good films. Ebert was right. Deven and Emmerich made horrible films with it's technical SFX as it's sort of savior in the box office.Godzilla pretty much reeks of everything but good eye candy. Was it fun? Once again, hit that mute button and turn off your brain.",Godzilla
202,bbrasher1,A G-FAN's WORST NIGHTMARE,4,24 December 2002,"As a modern day rampaging monster flick, it isn't too bad. As a modern day rampaging monster flick bearing the name GODZILLA, it's just plain awful. I first got to see this during G-CON, a gathering of Godzilla fans from across the country and almost everyone agreed that any resemblence between this one and the original was a dirty shame. (One of the actors from the original Godzilla series, who was a featured guest at the convention, walked out during the movie-can't say that I blame him). Granted, GODZILLA '98 was nowhere near as bad as, say, KING KONG LIVES, but it's painful to watch, knowing all along that a far superior remake had been in the works by director Jon DuMont (SPEED, STARSHIP TROOPERS) and had been canned just before being picked up by Devlin & Emmerich.
And by the way, the acting is hideous. Only Hank Azaria and the monster( I refuse to refer to that mutated iguana as Godzilla) turn in a decent performance.Rating:  *1/2",Godzilla
203,clivy,Doesn't live up to the trailer- I prefer the original Godzilla (or Reptar)!,5,22 April 2004,"When the trailer came out showing the pounding of Godzilla's feet getting louder and then the museum scene getting squished my husband and I cheered. But when the film came to the flicks we heard it stank, so we stayed away.Godzilla came on TV last night so I decided to watch it. The buzz was true: it didn't live up to the hype or the legend.The storyline started promisingly, with loads of nuclear blasts and shots of lizards, the Japanese boat getting slashed and sunk, and the old guy screaming Godzilla's Japanese name. But when it switched to Dr. Nick hunting for earthworms and started following him around it quickly turned into another mediocre movie with taglines to tell the audience where the characters were.The love story with Audury was out of a TV movie. Most of the characters were out of TV movies. The special effects were great: the shots of the planes chasing Godzilla around the canyons of New York skyscrapers were breaktaking.But poor Godzilla didn't get to do what he does best: knock down buildings, scream, breathe fire and flatten cars, people, and anything that gets in his way. Godzilla mark 1998 is Godzilla lite. He isn't angry, he rips into buildings by accident with his tail, he's too busy looking for fish. The plot with the eggs was as plausible as Dr Nick discovering Godzilla was pregnant with the aid of drugstore Be Sure tests. The idea of Madison Square Garden full of eggs that started to hatch was awesome, and the baby Godzillas fighting over bags of popcorn was cute, but it was a plot from another film.I was glad when Godzilla came back and started eating the main characters. Why did the writers have to digress with the pregnancy plot? It wasn't the Godzilla everyone knows and loves.The movie needed to focus more on what makes Godzilla great: wailing and stomping buildings, cars, people. The Rugrats' tribute to him with Reptar was right on target. I wanted more shots of mass destruction that made Tommy gurgle and kick over his blocks with joy. I wanted to feel that delight in strength and power too.If this is Godzilla, I prefer Reptar!",Godzilla
204,arnieiam,Ahead of its time,7,27 June 2008,"I remember this movie when it came out. I was like 8 years old and I remember the huge hype on this movie before it came out. I never got to see it in the theatre and I really wanted to see it. They never showed in the ads how the actual creature looked like. I really wanted to see how it looked like. I finally did see this movie. This movie is ahead of its time. The technology to make CGI characters was very limited in 1998. To show a really big lizard trash New York city for a movie of that time is something that deserve props. For a movie that came out in 2007 it was more than possible to show giant robots battle each other and trash a city. All that can be done with blue screens and a computer. But in 1998, model cities had to be used while the CGI lizard was composited in. And remember the lizard is like 10 times the size of optimus prime. Whether these smart ass critics like it or not, films that use a huge amount of special effects will always be a hit at the box office. This movie was way ahead of its time.",Godzilla
205,Xophianic,The preview was better than this movie,5,2 February 2000,"I remember sitting in the movie theaters when I first saw the preview in which a giant monster green foot crushed a T. Rex skeleton in a museum. It was a good preview, and I thought the movie would be just as good. I was wrong, the preview was better than the movie itself. The movie was boring, plotless, unfunny and annoying.The acting is not very good. Aside from Inspector Gadget, I think this is the worst that Matthew Broderick has ever done. The plot was almost nonexistant, much like the original Godzilla movies. The monster Godzilla and its babies were ok, but nothing too spectacular. I was hoping a few of the main cast would be eaten or fried or something, which didn't really happen.Most of the jokes really didn't work, the story was boring, the characters were flat and annoying and the movie itself, although it had a few fair moments, was very dull. Your kids may enjoy it, though.",Godzilla
206,flickjunkie-3,Over-Hyped Nonsense.,4,1 January 2001,"Godzilla had an intriguing trailer. But, lots of films have enthralling trailers and are bad films. Godzilla is one of them.Nuclear testing accidentally resurrects Godzilla, a huge foot monster with a big appetite. The monster takes Manhattan, and it's up to a select group of people, including Dr. Niko Tatopolous (Matthew Broderick) and Phillipe Roache (Jean Reno), to stop the monster, and it's soon-to-be-hatching eggs, before Godzilla's destroy the whole city, and maybe even the world.The postage-stamp-sized plot is poorly written. Everything is so repetitve! Godzilla attacks almost everyone on boats, and every time he comes to town it is raining like heck. Also, here's a question for ya. Why does Godzilla eat none of Manhatten's residents and it's babies do? There are many more questions to be answered, and mostly everything important about films has been ripped apart here. It has some slight pleasures, the monster itself is pretty well-done for special effects and the dumb acting is sometimes laughably enjoyable. But the characters are unlikeable, the plot is predictable and Godzilla, the monster itself, would suit a dancing film rather than a try-hard thriller.A pointless addition for Matthew Broderick's once-good career, Godzilla is nothing short of a let-down.I rate Godzilla 4 out of 10.",Godzilla
207,mrspasm,"Whoa There, Big Fella!",10,11 June 2009,"Godzilla is the American version of the crazy Chinese/Japanese original series. Who else but them could come up with a name like Godzilla. It's good that the Americans decided to keep this name rather than choose their own- it probably would have ended up being called Josh, or Todd, or The Big Dinosaur From Somewhere Unknown! The only other similarity is that Godzilla still loves to stomp around cities crushing buildings and eating puny earthlings. The bigger the building the better- The Empire State Building must be worth at least 200,000 points alone. Not to mention the mono rail and the chewitts bonus received when lifting trains off the tracks.The story goes: America has been experimenting with nukes in a sea far away. The creatures in the sea and on land are affected and mutated. Skip forward fiddy years and a huge earthquake has ripped through the ocean floor somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle. A bunch of scientists go out to investigate the strange aftershock readings and find some bewildering things, such as giant footprints. It soon becomes apparent that the quake has awoken a giant dinosaur which was created by the nukes years before. The dinosaur is angry and wants to destroy mankind! It is swimming to the nearest city and so begins a race for the scientists to prepare the city for attack, but who would believe a story about a giant monster? Of course Zilla arrives and begins punching, kicking, and chowing its way through London with relish. The effects are something truly special. It feels like you are really there, running between taxis, feeling the rumbles of the monsters footsteps. You look up, way up and see its massive jaws towering far above- it must be as big as 3 men! There is much action, excitement, and funny, and some scary parts. Baby Godzillas chase hapless fools through a hotel and into the sewers. We turn to night vision and don't see much; all we hear is some odd screechy noises. When the characters turn they see they are being followed by lots of yellow eyes in the darkness and so begins a terrifying chase through the London Subway. One girl gets bitten and subsequently explodes from her wounds. Meanwhile the Big Daddy climbs the London Eye to get away from all the helichopters shooting at it, but nothing seems to stop it.This is vastly superior to the original Black and White films. Firstly it's in colour so it's more believable. Secondly, they try to make you feel sorry for G'Z'A in the original, but here he's just a big nasty brute who must be destroyed. Let me ask you- if you were being chased by a monster, would you turn round and ask it why it was so angry, and if it's mother never hugged it? No! You would kick it in the gunells and be gone! If this film had been made before the originals then it would be held in higher regard than those ones, but unfortunately they got there first. I don't know who starred in this movie, but I think Geoff Goldbum was there and Matthew Modine.Best Scene: The tension between the boss of the scientists and the army boss is great throughout. The quote ""I'm running this Monkey Farm now, Frankenstein!"" is the highlight, just before Godzilla jumps in the window and pulls his legs off.",Godzilla
208,DorianWynHowells,Size matters does it? Well the size of the budget didn't do this film any justice - AWFUL!!!!,2,6 February 2002,"I'll try to be nice in my review here....oh why bother, I might as well get it all out eh?TRITE. RUBBISH. INSULTING. HORRIBLE. SCARY (the fact that they WASTED all that money on THIS!!!!!) Yeah....that just about sums up my feelings for this film.This is one film that would have been the best blockbuster of recent years, but the directors and producers forgot one vital element - a plot! There is no plot. The acting is awful, and the SFX? O.k. their nice to look at, but they look really dated now. How did this ever get made? Oh yeah I remember, it was made AFTER 'Independance Day' wasn't it?! Well, that explains it then!!!Save yourself the time, you could do far more constructive things for the 2 hours that this film takes to resolve itself!!!! And I can't believe they left it open for a sequel!!! Now THAT is insulting!!! not to mention up themselves!!! A good thing to do would be to watch a blank tv screen, your own imagination could come up with better things than this!!!2/10 - and judging by other low scorers, I'm being NICE!!Do not Enjoy!",Godzilla
209,Juni78ukr,Plainly silly and horrible,3,5 February 2004,"I didn't want to see this movie because I have heard and read too many bad things about Godzilla. But anyway, I watched it yesterday. The movie was so stupid and boring, what I can't find enough words to describe it. The plot was incredible lame, love story between Dr. Tatoupolos and Audrey so weak! But, more importantly, whole cast team looks incredibly poor. I really wonder, how Rolland Emmerich, who directed Stargate, Independence Day and The Patriot (not a great movies but highly entertained and well shot) could make so bad movie. Watch Jurassic Park movies (second and third of course not so good as first but they are at least watchable) or original King-Kong instead. Not recommend to anyone, except huge fans of monster's movies. Maybe they can find something interesting in this true disappointment. Personally I suppose that Godzilla is a strong candidate for worst movie of the year and excellent example that visual effects without good story and acting mean only waste of money and nothing more.My vote: plot 3, cast 3, sound 5, visual effects 6, stupidity 9 - overall 3,5/10 Thanks for reading.",Godzilla

212,james_corck3,The monster under (and over) the asphalt,7,25 November 2005,"OK, first of all we must forget about the original (and better Godzilla). Thsi new monster is now an already defeated beast, not an unforgettable character or a powerful image. Is a creature that is scary, and when you see it in full lenght, is kinda cute, but the scary effect is already lost. Still showing a dangerous aspect even after it presentation. The worst part of Godzilla, being honest and straight, are the characters, all of them very cliché, written using a book of ""How to write successful screenplays and don't die trying to"". The only two actors and character that survive this mayhem are Hank Azaria and Jean Reno, both of them not only funny but credible in their cliché skins.The creature design is kinda good, we can't say something bad about the guy who gave us the horrific aliens of ID4. Roland Emmerich is a good director, but this is his lowest movie till the date (not reaching the levels achieved by ID4 or The day after tomorrow) And if we add a too much long duration (more than 2 hours...what the hell they have in mind?) we can say only one thing. The original spirit of Godzilla is dead, but what came from the ashes is a very cool way of present a creature to the new generation, and also a good show for the special effects.",Godzilla

215,GluStick,Give this lizard a break,9,31 January 1999,"I really don't understand all of you. This movie was great. Definitely worth buying on tape or DVD. DVD is probably the best way to watch it. This movie has some of the best and creative action sequences i've seen in most of the movies in the great summer of '98. The cab/chase part is probably the best part of the movie. I admit the acting is very bad and the cast is NOT an A-list but they are not the star of the show. Godzilla is. The visual effects are some of the greatest i've seen. I love the way Godzilla smashes all the buildings trying to run and the part when the Madison Square Garden gets destroyed looked REALLY good.Forget about plot. Who needs it unless your some geek who always needs an inhaler. If you really enjoy to just sit back with a great movie and don't like to think than you should see this. If not than don't watch it.

217,StormSworder,Makes the 70's 'King Kong' re-make look like high art.,2,14 January 2006,"I was indifferent about this film when I first saw it, having never seen the original. I'll be bluntly honest in saying I spent at least two hours bored out of my skull. Alright, so monster-on-the-loose films are not known for in-depth plots and characterisation, but this really is a cynical cash-in. It shows promise to start with, what with the topical French nuclear testing being responsible for Godzilla's mutation, and the monster itself looks quite impressive, even if it is only fleetingly glimpsed in the pouring rain. But apparently the makers of this film hated Godzilla, and if you don't have any faith in your own film then how can you expect others to? The acting is of the couldn't-care-less-as-long-as-I-get-my-big-fat-cheque variety, and the monster is killed far too easily. Say what you like about the Japanese Godzilla films, at least the bad ones were a laugh. In Godzilla '98, fans of unintentionally comic monster movies have only a scene in which the film suddenly turns into Attack of the Wind-Up Baby Dinosaurs. It's no surprise to me that the two planned sequels were never made. More recently, I've seen the first Godzilla film from the fifties. Despite the low-budget effects, it's much better than this big bore. If this re-make didn't have the name 'Godzilla' it would just be yet another one of the nameless, faceless Godzilla rip-offs, would have been ignored by monster movie fans in droves.",Godzilla
218,SamRag,The problem was casting!,7,16 August 2002,"How could Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin create films such as Stargate and Independence day, and then somewhat fail with Godzilla.  Watching it the third time last night I tried to analyze what I felt was wrong with the film.  Everything is done to perfection when it comes to the technology behind making films.  Godzilla looks great and all surroundings are professionally done (excluding the scene where three helicopters follow Godzilla between skyscrapers, which was too much like a computer game, with fake looking buildings).  The story is not that badly written either.  It is somewhat believable in the sense that the army is quick to respond, and work systematically to eliminate the problem.  And the dialogs and character building is pretty good as well.  So where is it that this film fails, because no one that I've spoken to has much good to say about Godzilla?  I think it is the actors.  If you think about Independence day we have Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum which carry the film through, complimenting all the CGI work and professionalism that went into that film.  Same with Stargate where we have heavy weights like Kurt Russell and James Spader really making the film what it was.  In Godzilla we lack that, as Matthew Broderick, while undoubtedly being a good actor, just isn't that larger-then-live character which was required for this sort of a film.  He seems to kind a flounder from one scene to the next, never pulling of being the hero of the day. Same with Maria Pitillo, while being both beautiful and good actress, she seemed just as lost as Matthew in this part.  And this can be seen when we have Jean Reno on the screen; the film pulls itself up and becomes interesting.  He has that magic and is both believable and interesting.  I also liked Hank Azaria, as the camera man trying to film the great story, while being more afraid of his wife then Godzilla.  Godzilla is one of the best examples of how important casting is.  Because without a doubt Godzilla had everything else working in its advance, while just lacking the thrust which powerful lead actors can give a film. 7/10",Godzilla
219,reisen55,A Personal story,7,30 August 2016,"OK, this is a dark, rainy movie that has it's issues with portraying Godzilla as a true villain. Secondly, the scale is way off in terms of humans sized up against the big lizard. The leads have a tough time of it too. There was also zero time for preview and fixes to be applied by Sony so it had to be released as it was.For me it was one true virtue, a life-saver. On September 11 I had walked down from the 101st floor, south tower to the 74th floor, south tower which was where I was when that tower was hit - 4 floors below that fireball. I briefly turned to look, decided against it and came back to the staircase when I saw a huge gasoline fed fireball expanding in the hallway. After realizing that this was BAD indeed, I looked at the staircase door. BLESS JEAN RENO for the line : RUNNING WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.So this bad movie saved my life. Not bad really.",Godzilla

The plot is however not half as interresting as the Jurassic Park movies (and their plot isn't very good either). This movie is not based on a plot at all but on the chance to make special f/x more breathtaking than those in ID4. The actors do a fine job, but they are lost in the explosions and computer work. This movie is also very full of cliches like: The monster manages to evade super-modern heatseeking missiles and the choppers are so bad at aiming that they wouldn't hit an elephant if it stood still in front of the choppers' machineguns. And when the movie finally ends one is sure that you will have to suffer a continuation. So let's settle down and wait for Godzilla 2 to attack the world with its meaningless plot.",Godzilla

The relatively weak story, limited comic relief, and flat out lack of suspense killed the otherwise superior special effects work. OK, we know that Matthew Broderick was in it, so we knew it wasn't going to be ""Places in the Heart"" but we were expecting some thrills. The single biggest problem was the over exposure of Godzilla to early. For example in ""Jurassic Park"" sure, you saw dinosaurs right away, but not the raptors or the T-Rex, they were given a frightful build up that slowly made your heart race with anticipation. Once you had seen a full screen shot of Godzilla it was like the cat was out of the bag. As you watch you know what is going to happen at every turn, nothing was unexpected. It was worth the price of the video rental, but at the box office you got ripped off. I felt like I was. The end threatens a sequel, so be weary and wait for the video. If Hollywood is smart they will market it direct to video. I don't think we will see any more huge objects painted green.",Godzilla

I don't deny any of this.But in my opinion, Godzilla (1998) is very fun to watch (and kinda funny). The action is great, the pacing is good, Reno and Azaria are very likable and even the CGI is decent, if you compare it to today standards (back in the '90s, it was amazing)Final rating: 8,3/10 (highly underrated action movie)",Godzilla
227,pdqpaul,movie is on a par with jurassic park,10,16 January 2020,"I like this movie a lot, I noticed that people have been able to pick up on a lot of goofs, etc, but even with the goofs in the movie, it's really and entertaining movie. maybe not quite up to Jurassic park, but close. again just a very very entertaining movie.",Godzilla
228,rorymacveigh,This Film isn't all that bad to be honest,6,6 August 2012,"I realise that on a critical level this film has been panned, but in terms of watching it as an audience, I don't find it as awful to watch as others would make out. Yes it is factually inaccurate in some places, the CGI could do with a little brushing up and the acting could be refined slightly, but other than that, there is nothing to say this film is that bad to watch. It's pretty much just a turn off film for a rainy Saturday night and basically I have no real problems with that, just as long as it's not obnoxiously unenjoyable like other films of this calibre.The film begins showing reels of the Atomic bomb tests on the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, and focuses specifically on the lizards that inhabit the island. The scene then cuts to a Japanese Cargo Ship, which is suddenly attacked by a large underwater creature with the loss of all but 1 of the crew. We then move to the evacuated Chernobyl, where our lead character Niko Tatopoulos is carrying out tests to see the influence of radiation on the genetics of earthworms in the area. But suddenly he is called in by the US Military to examine a large set of footprints that are spread across the Panama countryside. Meanwhile, the last surviving member of the stricken Cargo ship is asked questions by a mysterious French man played by Jean Reno, the only answer he is given is the chilling name of 'Godzilla'. The trail of the large footprints eventually leads them to Jamaica where another cargo ship has been attacked and washed ashore. The damage on the ship's hull indicates that some kind of large beast had clawed its way through the hull in order to access the large numbers of fish the ship was carrying. Meanwhile a trio of Fishing Trawlers off the Atlantic Seaboard are dragged under for some unknown reason. The film then moves to New York City where we are introduced to Niko's ex-girlfriend, who is a struggling news reporter desperate to make her name with a major story. Coincidently, her big break arrives as Godzilla begins his attack upon the city, smashing his way through buildings, stomping on many unfortunate Taxi Cabs and generally running wild in the city before disappearing from sight. Niko is then brought to New York to assist in the search for the vicious beast that lurks in the bowels of the city. Realising that Godzilla has an appetite for fish, the Military prepare a fish trap by bringing piles upon piles of fish to one place in order to lure him out. But the plan fails and after another mad dash through the city, Godzilla loses his pursuers and disappears into the city's underground. Meanwhile, using some blood samples Niko determines that Godzilla reproduces Asexually and is either about to lay eggs or has done already. However, he is kicked off the case after his girlfriend steals at Top Secret tape from his tent in an earlier scene before broadcasting it on the news. His girlfriend attempts to apologise but Niko no longer has faith in her and leaves the scene, only to find that he has been shanghaied by a group of French Secret Service agents who had previously posed as Insurance agents. They plan to assist Niko in finding Godzilla's nest by breaking back into Manhattan disguised as American Soldiers. Meanwhile, another trap is set up in Central Park to subdue Godzilla, but this also fails and after another chase scene, the creature is forced into the Hudson River where he is blasted by torpedo's from pursuing Submarines. The city assumes Godzilla destroyed and prepare to re-inhabit Manhattan. However, Niko and the French agents, followed closely by his Girlfriend (who is desperate to make up to him) and a fellow News Cameraman, discover the nest in Madison Square Garden, where several hundred eggs have been laid. As the French agents prepare to set up explosives to destroy the nest, the eggs begin to hatch and since they smell of fish, the smaller monsters attack the agents. Eventually the group find themselves cornered in the Commentators box and send a message to the outside world about the presence of the deadly reptiles that could potentially become the new dominant species on the planet if the Garden is not destroyed by US Fighter Aircraft. Responding to their demands, fighters are dispatched and with seconds to spare, our heroes escape the building just before it is levelled with missiles. However, just as the group consider the day saved, Godzilla is revealed to have survived and now in a fit of Paternal rage, chases after the group who have now commandeered a Taxi. In a daring chase across the city, the group eventually tangle Godzilla in the suspension cables of the Brooklyn Bridge, allowing the fighters to come back and finish off the beast, which falls the ground and slowly dies. The City celebrates, Jean Reno quietly disappears and Niko and his Girlfriend get back together.Although this film seems to have a typical sort of story to it, and with the numerous factual inaccuracies and errors, it really is a good popcorn movie, and like many Roland Emmerich films, they are not there to be watched with a critical eye, but more to be watched with a casual sort of attitude, where you just sit back, disengage your brain and enjoy the film.",Godzilla
229,Merklin,"Poor as a godzilla film , but good as a simple popcorn flick .",7,23 September 2005,"Many godzilla fans hate the 1998 American remake of godzilla, and to be honest they have every right to .The character of godzilla has been reduced to a simple minded monster-of-the week who doesn't have a opponent to face, there's no real sense of danger and the film amongst other inconsistencies doesn't explain how a monster the size of the empire state building can hide in new york with out being noticed .However....... i don't hate it .Sure, its no way as good as it could have been and it ignores its great source material , but it works as a no brain popcorn movie so well that you can forgive its flaws, switch your off your sense of logic and enjoy the carnage.The CG godzilla looks great and seeing it trashing up the place is a joy to behold and jean reno ,matthew broderick and hank azaria do well with the material they have been given .The film itself is corny but in a likable, unintentionally funny way which is great, considering that this is a film a giant lizard......Yes ,this isn't the godzilla remake we would have liked to have seen but if you treat it as a dumb, fun way to kill some time then you wont be disappointed.",Godzilla
230,dayton-w-price,Jean Reno is the man.,8,15 January 2021,"I owe this movie a lot, being the first time I saw Jean Reno and immediately loved him as an actor, I had to go watch everything he'd ever been in, to this day I consider myself a massive fan of his work, thanks to Godzilla. I first watched it at my uncles house when I was about 9 or so, I just remember him showing off his new surround sound system, the best money could buy in 2002, while we watched it. I don't get all the grief about it, I actually enjoyed it more than the 2014 Godzilla, the one where they talked about Godzilla and some how forgot to show him. Action was lacking and the MUTO where stupid monsters in my opinion, this movie is a lot more fun to watch and not boring at all.",Godzilla
231,seanroger-82963,Thumbs down,3,31 December 2020,It was a struggle to keep focused on this movie. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie.,Godzilla
232,Servo-11,Not as bad as I thought,7,15 November 2001,"I rented this movie for one reason: Jean Reno.  And I was expecting that he would be the only redeeming feature of it.  Well, he was, but the special effects were great, too.  I was more entertained that I thought I would be because I'd heard about how much of a steaming pile of Godzilla poopie this movie was.  Sure, it was mindless entertainment where you need to check your brain at the door.  But so are the old Japanese guy-in-a-rubber-suit Godzilla movies where you not only have to suffer through prolonged battles of ridiculous monsters stomping on models, but you also have to suffer through mind-bendingly bad dubbed dialogue.  I can only watch Godzilla movies when accompanied by MST3K's Joel and the 'bots.  On my own, I become a blubbering mass of jelly.This movie was easier to get through and I didn't really feel like it was long.  I certainly enjoyed it better than Independence Day, what with all that rah-rah patriotism which has become part of our lives since Sept. 11th and which has worn extremely thin.  This story was expensive, yes, but it did deliver on the thrills, and having Madison Square Garden filled with little Godzillas was pretty neat.  Kind of an Alien/Jurassic Park type of thing combined.The acting did leave much to be desired, mainly Maria Pitello who has a perpetual ""Man, I'm so bummed!"" expression on her face.  She was awful, and Matthew Broderick isn't exactly the studly action hero.  But in today's action movies, bio-scientists aren't normally the heroes anyway.  And it was kind of a nice change to not have Chunk Studmeat blasting his way across the screen.  Hank Azaria was good, too, for what we saw of him.  And I thought the Godzilla creature FX rocked.  And so did Jean Reno. :P7/10",Godzilla

I'm still not clear why the American public despises this so much. Can you say ""bandwagon""? IT IS NOT BAD AT ALL! What did you people expect? The Sound of Music??? I went in this movie to see awesome special effects, good use of digital surround sound, and stunts. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I GOT!!! ""Oh man, but the dialogue, the acting, blah blah blah"". Oh yeah, I forgot THAT'S why I was seeing this movie! And I saw American Beauty for the action, Shakespeare in Love for the stunts, and Gandhi for the special effects! STOP TRYING TO DRAW BLOOD FROM A STONE!

234,Welly-2,A smashing film!,9,27 July 1999,"I simply can't understand why so many people give this film such low marks. It is the best Godzilla film ever, and it is so packed full of excitement, entertainment and effects that it ranks amongst the best of most other genres as well. If the film is being judged on its plot or its literary profundity then that is as daft as judging Remains of the Day on its special effects or Bambi on its social commentary. This film set out to be about a big monster running around New York and it does it wonderfully. I watched it first at the cinema in a front row seat and the buzz of that hour and three quarters is still with me! This is the best monster film there is and any one who argues will be forced to watch The Land That Time Forgot until they change their minds!",Godzilla
235,ARTaylor,"Come On People, Relax.",8,29 April 2006,"So what if it's not the big hit like Star Wars or the huge Oscar winner like The Godfather. Not every movie can be that. This is still good. It's not the kind of movie where everyone who watches it says ""Oh my gosh that was the best movie EVER I just have to watch it over and over again!"" But it's not the kind of movie where five minutes in you're wondering ""Uh, what is this crap?"" But after reading some other comments I'm going to try to respond to a few.""He doesn't have the screen presence of the original!""Of course it doesn't have real screen presence! It's a computer generated image. But the original was a guy in a rubber suit in a model city. That's about as fake as they come. At least this movie used real locations and put the monster in. Of course since people have nothing to base a fifty story lizard off of it looks real enough. The original is just a guy dressed as a lizard. He moves and acts like a person in a suit. This one actually acts like a giant lizard. If a lizard was fifty stories or so that's probably how it would act.""Does he breathe fire or doesn't he?""No! But do real lizards breathe fire? It's hard enough explaining how a fifty story lizard came to be. They don't need to complicate it anymore by having to explain fire breathing.""How hard is it really to pronounce Tatopoulos?""It's a joke people! A running gag. If you saw that and didn't hear how it's pronounced could you do better?""The story is unrealistic.""It's a movie about a giant lizard. How realistic is it supposed to be? John McClane gets through all of Die Hard with no shoes. Indiana Jones seems to single handedly defeat every single German that comes at him. Axel Foley can solve any crime in Detroit and Beverly Hills. Movies aren't made to be realistic. They're to be entertaining.""He goes down way to easily.""They seem to hit him with a lot before he actually goes down. Torpedoes, missiles, machine guns. He takes a lot of damage before he dies. Also I think he kind of gave up after all his kids were dead.""All the baby Godzillas look like raptors.""Alright I'll give you that one. The whole thing with the babies probably could have waited till a sequel to do. It does seem to drag on the movie a little longer than it really needed to be. It doesn't really have you looking at your watch waiting for it to end. The movie is action-packed enough so you're not thinking about the time too much.""It's too much like Jurassic Park.""You could say the same thing about Star Wars and Star Trek. But those two seem to get along fine.""He only runs, he never fights.""He has no weapons. He's an animal. Not a person. He could stomp on them I guess but that would probably make him an easier target. He's not stupid. If you were to start shooting things at your cat or dog and it hurt it would it attack you? Probably not. It would probably run from you.""It's just not the original.""Neither is The Mummy with Brendan Fraser. But for some reason that one's considered a great remake. Both pretty much do the same thing. They both took the basic idea of the original and applied it to a different situation. They couldn't just do exactly what the original did or you get just another Psycho remake. They took the idea of a lizard, enlarged by radiation, coming to modern day America, and how America tries to deal with it. People have seen all those campy monster flicks. You don't keep eating the same breakfast cereal every morning. You got to give audiences something different than what they expect.""He doesn't destroy enough.""What do you want him to do? Just walk around destroying everything he sees? He's not there to destroy the city. He's there to live, to make a nest. You don't go around destroying your household. He's trying to make New York his home, not a garbage dump. He could go around destroying everything, but for what reason? It would make no sense to have him mindlessly destroy everything.""It's GINO (Godzilla In Name Only).""LIGHTEN UP PEOPLE! If you really wanted to see a guy in a rubber suit attacking Tokyo then watch the Japanese movies. This is supposed to be different. It's supposed to not look like the original. If you want to see the Mummy as a well-known member of society then watch the Boris Karloff Mummy. If you want to see the Mummy turn into a wall of sand then watch the Brendan Fraser Mummy. If they did have a guy in a rubber suit you would all be complaining that ""It's just copying the original, it's not doing anything different.""This is a great movie if you just give it the chance. So at least watch it once. It seems that it's just one of those where you either love it or you hate it. Don't go in expecting the original. The original is a classic in it's own right. It's a good action film that you can take your kids to without worrying about blood, gore, violence, language, etc. The worst part (violencewise) is the ending, which only shows Godzilla getting hit with missiles. Other than that it's pretty clean.It seems to me that there are plenty of people who do like this movie. I like this movie. I bought it. I would like to see a sequel. I think it was well done.8/10",Godzilla

237,eldergod-1,"Not as good as ""Jurassic Park"", not as funny as the Japanese movies - failure.",4,9 February 2005,"""Independence Day"" creator Roland Emmerich tried to make a great scifi action with his remake of the classic Japanese story of the giant monster Godzilla - and failed completely. His film basically is not about Godzilla, the strange invincible monster, which is a nemesis to the arrogant humanity. It's movie about some big monster, which is walking in New York, not doing really anything. There are some stolen moments from ""Jurassic Park"", but this does not saves the movie, on the contrary, it makes it even more pitiful. The main character is incredibly annoying, I really hated him. That said, the film has decent visual effects and Jean Reno is really cool, as is the monster itself. Even if not a real Godzilla, the big lizard is devious and clever and I actually liked it more than the stupid humans from this film. But overall I was quite disappointed. I have seen worst movie, but I have seen far better too.",Godzilla
238,takatomon,godzilla the way it should be done. BIG FUN!,10,22 July 2003,"WOW! i can't believe all of the negative comments about this movie. i loved it and bought it. it was nice to see a believable godzilla for once after seeing all of the cheesy originals as a kid. i think that alot of the negativity is from ""gojira purists"". that's bunk. to whoever said that americans shouldn't make a godzilla movie. BZZZT!!!!! japan has made king kong movies!godzilla '98 gets it right. the sfx are great. this aint' no rubbersuited monster destroying toys. as to the ""lack of personality"" alot of people speak of, godzilla isn't a gameshow host... it's a wild animal! it's even mentioned in the movie that few actually seemed to watch. '98 didn't have an agenda... it was simply following instinct. it does have a personality too. it's smart. it learns from experience and adapts. i guess everyone missed the helicopter chase where '98 outwits the pilots. at the very end, '98 also gets extremely cheesed off. i guess everyone missed that too as well as the touching unspoken ""why?"" line at the very end.i liked the more serious trying to be realistic approach much better than any ""gojira"" film. i really liked the humor alot too eg. ""all of the guns and we didn't do anything"" ""that's not true... we fed it""
and why does everone rag on the leading lady? she's HOT HOT HOT! i love her full pouty lips. she makes me feel naughty when shen has a lollypop. LOLeveryone has their own opinion about the film, but i think the makers have a genuine affection for gojira and wanted to improve upon it with a more believable big budget homage. i think they succeeded.all the sly nods to jurassic park etc. are fun too. my favorite is the theatrical trailer take on ""bambi vs. godzilla"" where godzilla stomps on a t. rex skeleton in a museum. it's too bad they didn't include it in the film. it's hysterical.if you watch the film, don't compare it to the original cheeseballs, but watch it as a serious attempt to make godzilla more beliveable.8 out of 10",Godzilla

240,foxhound-37781,Still makes for a fun and exciting popcorn flick.,8,26 October 2020,"I picked up a cheap copy of this in 4K just the other day. haven't having seen this movie for the best part of 20 years I was very curious to see how it still holds up today. and the overall result, not bad and still reasonably enjoyable.Yes the CGI is very dated now but for 1998 it must have been awe inspiring seeing this at the cinema, especially the closeup shot of Godzilla zooming right in up close to Nick. The helicopter chase sequences and Godzilla dodging the missiles and buildings in the background getting destroyed are some of the coolest elements of a monster movie you could ask for.The finale in Maddison Square Garden with the hundreds of babies is still comical and yet tense to this day. The ending is fitting and I still love the impact that final scene has where Godzilla is slowly dying and you get to hear his heart take its final beats. The actors all play a good part as well. Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno are obviously the two that stand out above the rest but we also have Hank Azaria as well (voice actor from the simpsons).All in all i'll never understand why people hate this movie so much..... It's a Godzilla movie what were you all honestly expecting? yes it is a movie you kinda have to be in the right mood for but I cant imagine how amazing this must have been to see this on the big screen back in 1998.

Matthew Broderick as the man character Nick Stutapolis or what ever the heck his name is, is perhaps the worst acting I have ever seen on film. Nothing in the movie is familiar with the Godzilla we all know and love from Japan. Godzilla is portrayed in this film as just another one of them Jurassic Park dinosaurs instead of a kick ass dinosaur that shoots atomic breath.I hate this movie. It is so bland and boring, and not the way an American movie remake should be.

Good story, good acting, great special effects, a few good jokes, and very good action. How this can upset so many people just because Godzilla didn't look like someone wearing a rubber suit for once is beyond me.The majority of complaints seem to be that this version of Godzilla looked and acted realistically like an animal rather than a cartoonish monster ...again ...after 20 (I don't care enough to look it up) other Godzilla movies to watch if that's what you really want to see. Well I say there's room in this world for both the silly and non-silly takes on the Godzilla franchise.My only complaint is the same one I have about almost every Hollywood action film in that the upper military command and politicians are portrayed to be complete retards who ignore both the scientists and common sense; but I think by now we all know to expect that sort of weak plot device by now.",Godzilla

246,The Bronson Fan,Awful film that insults the legendary Japanese monster and his fans.,1,3 September 2005,"Before one even reads this review lets get one thing straight. This is not and never will be a Godzilla film. This was Hollywood yet again taking a name and using it for nothing more then profit. Or lack there of. Recent films and TV used for name value have also proved to be pure failures or garbage such as Garfield, The Honeymooners (maybe the worst), Kojack, The Manchurian Candidate, Charlie and the Chocolate factory and to many to mention here. If anything it is a poor rip-off of many films, including The Beast from 20,000 fathoms, that was done much better back in the day.""Godzilla"" starts out in south pacific with French nuclear testing that mutates some islands and some iguanas at the same time. Years later some Japanese fisherman are attacked and their boat sunk. Devlin had to throw in the Japanese fisherman scene to have more than just the ""Godzilla"" name to his creature......it didn't work. Soon a monster is spotted near the Panama canal and they call in a bumbling worm scientist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Broderick) who is also an expert on atomic energy. After looking at a big footprint he concludes that its a big mutated iguana. It heads north to New York where it makes its appearance and runs through the city for the rest of the movie. The military somehow can't manage to find the creature (yeah I'll buy that) and when they do, they fail miserably to even hurt it. Watch as advanced weapons seemingly miss this creature and hit major buildings in NY. Dr. Nick discovers that the beast is pregnant and is going to make a nest. Dr. Nick soon runs into his old flame Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) a wannabe reporter who is a failure and eventually back stabs Dr. Nick, taking a top secret video for her breaking evening news report. She spills the beans about the monsters asexual reproduction (give me a break) getting Nicko fired from the military committee. Meantime some French have been watching everything and kidnap Nick to go destroy the monster and eggs. The reporters tag along and they find the nest in Madison square garden and the Jurassic park rip-off begins. They manage to escape only to be perused by a now angry monster parent, but lure ""it"" to the Brooklyn Bridge where F-18s finish it off with some missiles. Nick looks into the creatures eyes and mutters some nonsense reminiscent of yet another movie, King Kong. But of course they do leave an opening for a sequel. Thankfully it hasn't happened.As a life long Godzilla fan you can imagine I was more than upset when this film came out. Not that it was any surprise. I had know through G-Fan since 1996 that this film would be garbage and it was confirmed as more time went by and pictures were revealed of this so called ""Godzilla"". This is not a Godzilla film in any way, but just a badly written generic monster flick that seems to rip off many films while ruining the legend from Japan. This was one of the most hyped films of 1998 and yet I knew it would fail and it did. Devlin had claimed how ""Godzilla"" would be far superior and better than the old one. How is that, by running away from the military, not having his trademark radioactive ray, being killed with one rocket and laying eggs? A complete disgrace. The design wasn't all that bad for a creature, but not Godzilla. From the script to the acting, almost everything in this film is just awful. The acting is really bad, the blonde cant act and Broderick is not only terrible, but plays a really stupid scientist that one can't possibly believe would be smart enough to be in the position he is in and defeat this creature. I was surprised that Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer didn't start spouting Simpsons lines halfway through the film. Also, the American military is a complete failure when trying to kill or find the creature. How about follow the foot prints? Through out the movie there are many attempts at humor that fail on all levels. When watching this film, you'll find that much of it is joke, not that the concept is that serious, but the Original Godzilla was somewhat. The script and dialog are terrible, along with a movie that is much to long and relies heavily on movies of the past for ideas. Godzilla (obviously), the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, Jurassic Park, and a little of Kong at the end. Devlin and them ripped of War of the Worlds to make Independence Day. That worked out well I thought, but they failed miserably with Godzilla. The only area I give some credit to in this film are some of the special effects. I am not a fan of CGI by any means, but they were not bad in this film. Even today the CGI in this film holds up to more recent films that have been made. Although that's not saying much. Overall this is a poor film on almost all levels and was a opportunity squandered by Hollywood on what should have been a true Godzilla film. Overall 1 stars out of 10 stick to the Japanese version. Avoid the album as well its infamous for Puff Daddy destroying the legendary Led Zeppelin song Kashmir.",Godzilla
247,TheMunkeyBoy,"20 Years late, but finally watched",6,22 June 2018,"Not really a review, just an opinion from seeing it 20 years after it was released. I never cared too much to see it as I thought it looked a little fake from the previews that I saw back in the day (although I did buy the soundtrack back then for the songs). 
Decided to watch it and although I cringed at a lot of parts - some of the direction, sometimes the acting or the dialogue that was written, plus a lot of the CGI - there was a lot that could have been better. 
It wasn't a good story. 
The CGI wasn't great, even for the time. 
Character interactions were shocking at times. 
But, I still found myself watching to the end and I had a good time. The more recent 2014 Godzilla was outstanding in my opinion and this '98 mo ie does not touch that. But, I just viewed it as an over-hollywoodised monster film and just enjoyed it as a B-Grade movie in a better budget. That way I could laugh in some places. I don't really recommend the film. But it wasn't a total disaster. It really did remind me of how a lot of films were done in the 90's - the style in which they wrote I mean. We've come a long way.",Godzilla

The acting isn't the greatest and the film doesn't have the best story, but it is lot of fun to watch. This film also mimics a lot of Jurassic Park scenes. The film has a giant mutated iguana migrate to Manhathan to nest her/his eggs. The monster doesn't destroy as much as you would think, in fact, the army destroys more than the monster does. The acting as stated earlier is bad, but then again, this is a Roland Emerich film, its popcorn entertainment, not a multiple Oscar winner.

The military was stupid, in fact so stupid I wonder how all those guys made it there without shooting themselves by accident on their first day?! Why at all attack a ""tall as a skyscraper-creature"" with any kind of handguns? Why not just some massive rocket launched cyanide canisters or whatever else?? Because then that thing would have died rather quickly and the viewers wouldn't have been tormented for 2 hours! -1pAlso: The funny thing is that whenever it wasn't necessary any 'zilla, whether small or tall, could run like hell and be quick, but at the time when the food (our heroes) were right in front of their jaws they mainly stood about pretending to be extinct or something! Ever seen a crocodile in a feeding frenzy? I'd say that 20 saltwater crocodiles in Madison Square garden would have given us more action in this movie than these 200 or what 'zillas did! -1pNext thing that irritated me was those helicopter pilots! Still shooting with their miniguns or vulcans or whatever they had (shooting straight at the buildings in front of them) eventho big 'zilla had already speeded around the corner and wasn't visible anymore.... STUPID -1pReno is a cool actor, but what the hell were the French doing in the US staging some secret operation to kill a beast that was the main focus of public attention? Where they maybe thinking that if they killed 'zilla quickly (in the middle of NY) nobody would notice the animal and subsequently not blame the French? -2pThe French agents were just as stupid as the Americans. -1p2 rather equal scenes with ships being destroyed and then a completely stereotypical-non-funny-predicable scene with some old guy fishing on the peer catching big 'zilla, the lure cast out 10 feet ahead of him, the hook getting caught by 'zilla and then the monster speeding at him from 1000 feet away??????? Come on! *Big sigh* so how far did that old man really cast out the lure? 3 or 1000 feet??? -1pWhen the beast was caught in the suspension cables of the bridge it was almost down to a crawl, but when it fell its head fell to the ground... about what? Half a mile further ahead? It really seems that the length of the creature was variable whenever needed for some stupid semi-SHOCK effect. -1pThe little ones did attack (or try to attack) the heroes because of what? Because they smelled like fish! Why did mother/father Godzilla not attack Tatataatapopolous? Didn't he smell like fish after having been part of that fish pile orgy in the middle of the street? -1pAm I down to a total of 1 point yet? No actually I am on 0... So before I put any more effort than needed into razing this rather flavorless movie to the ground I better add that I enjoyed it one time, as mentioned in the beginning, but I will never enjoy it again. It's a bit of a pain that movie! Let your six year olds watch it, they might still get surprised or excited or frightened... unless they haven't watched Steve Ervin (or however his name might be spelled (god bless him)) wrestle with some crocks or unless they haven't watched all Friday the 13th or TCM yet or any other B movie that is slightly more realistic and chilling than this very costly and unnecessary B movie!Good day!",Godzilla
251,Nixon_Carmichael,A film so bad that I figuratively considered suicide.,2,19 November 2015,"After seeing what Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich did with Godzilla in 1998, it almost made me lose hope for our species. You would presume, in a Roland Emmerich film, you could at least count on high end visual, but nothing in this film looks or seems remotely real. I am not a realist who demands that a given sequel, remake, prequel or reboot, must be faithful to source material, I'm not a purist in any sense of the word, Roland and Dean managed to alienate both Godzilla fans of old and new, would-be fans simultaneously. By not adhering to old lore AND replacing it typical Hollywood tropes, they've made a film that has no appeal and zero percent rewatchability. In the 1990s, this was almost as bad as it got.",Godzilla

In one film they even point out the monster that attacked NY was not Godzilla, and in Final Wars it has a appearance as Zilla, as the director is quoted as saying that the movie took the God out of Godzilla. It also gets its CGI backside kicked back to the ice age by the true and proved Godzilla the King of the Monsters. I did like Star Gate and ID4, and cant understand how the directors, writers etc could have ever let this movie be released with there names attached, not to mention the cast. If there is a career breaking movie this is it. I doubt very much any one wishes to be associated with this CGI mistake that should have been a deleted program, and left on the cutting room floor.",Godzilla

The series of Godzilla films started with a man in a rubber suit, and went down-hill after that. They have a certain interest as relics of a post-war Japanese society. But do we need a remake of a poor original when we have so many appalling films of own in the west?Having said all that, the film itself is actually not as bad as it might have been. But it is ultimately just another bad monster movie (no pun intended).",Godzilla
254,blackasp98,sort of OK,5,21 July 2008,"Alright here it is, for one i have been a Godzilla fan since i was a kid. This movie was excellent for special effects and story line. BUT.... what i didn't need to see was a few actors from a previous movie of both dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. For those who don't remember during the sub scene one of the captains from the sub was from independence day. A helicopter pilot who came to one of the ships in order to make contact. A black guy i cant remember his name offhand, but it was so disconcerting to see him in there playing again a soldier or captain or such. Some of the other actors also appeared in the film from independence day. I hate to say this, but even though i hold very high regards for both dean and Roland, it would have been nice to see some new fresh faces on the screen rather than looking at a few of the same actors who made their film independence day so huge. Other than that Mathew Broderick was very classy in this film as a biologist in the field of chemical attributes from fallout effects on animals. Along with his cohorts who help his theories of trying to convince the army that Godzilla has laid eggs in Madison square garden. It was a very approachable story and to watch Godzilla in action again was a treat. Very well done special effects and keeping his size the same. But for the downside it was sad to see same actors in this film from a previous one. This is the first time i gave a movie of this caliber below ten.",Godzilla
255,forrestwrs,Godzilla--Great Monster VS Dumb Man,5,29 May 2007,"Godzilla was a great visual experience, and with great sound for that matter. What the movie lacked in plot and substance, it made up for in effects. Acting wasn't too horrible (with, perhaps, the exception of Ms. Audrey Timmons). In fact, I believe Matthew Broderick did a very nice job with the poor plot he was given. Also, Jean Reno's character is probably one of my all time favorites.One of the biggest flaws in this movie is editing. More jabber by the actors than destruction by our Godzilla friend. The film makers had a great CGI monster on their hands--I really don't see why they didn't take more advantage of it.Other than that weird music at the end credits, I'd have to say the music was at least decent.I think the main factor behind Godzilla's downfall wasn't the planes at all, but the advertising before the movie ever came out. That got on MY nerves more than anything else (""His eyes is bigger than this billboard,"" etc.).Other than the plot holes and editing problems, Godzilla was a fairly good film. I place blame on the director more than anyone else for not making it ""Bigger, Louder, and Funner!""",Godzilla
256,eternalsea,Emmerichs best film,6,11 March 2006,"Godzilla is an underrated film. It is directed by Roland Emmerich the man behind mediocre space adventures stargate and Independece day. Some people say Godzilla is his worst film to date well let me start by saying its a hell of a lot better than either of those two. The story is Nuclear tests have happened in France and the radio activity has come of on some of the Lizards inhabiting the islands. Fast forward some twenty years and we learn that a giant dinosaur creature is attacking boats around the globe. It comes to Manhatten were it wrecks havoc and there are quite a few fun sequences along the way. Thats all I will say its vague but I hate spoiling movies. The creature looks cool indeed and 90% of the time the visual effects are of a very high standard. The story is solid if a little simple, but at least it ain't covuluted a la stargate. The acting is a mixed bag however with Hank Azaria and Jean Reno in fine form while Matthew Broderik and Maria Pitillo putting in appalling performances. Some of the characters are unnecessary and annoying such as Harry Shearers Charles Caimen and some of the military guys. The finale is great and the film is on a par with the previous years equally underrated The Lost World Jurassic Park. Its a good movie for kids as it never gets to scary and always remains entertaining, but it also works for adults as Saturday night entertainment. Well I enjoyed it anyway, so sit back don't take it to seriously and you to might find yourself enjoying it to",Godzilla

Tried watching it as an adult and I see why i didn't enjoy it as a kid.Godzilla looked AWFUL, when I think Godzilla I think of a T. rex like creature in Jurassic Park, NOT the odd thing on my screen. To make it worse all the science talk bored my kid mind, as an adult I understood it more, but still boring. The characters are all annoying. The only good thing is the spoofing of Siskel and Ebert because they at least got a chuckle out of me",Godzilla

I hope Roland Emmerich will make in the future a better Godzilla movie.",Godzilla
260,vkn,Why oh why did I not heed everyone's warning about this?,2,13 April 2002,"Even with my expectations set at a very low level, this American 'interpretation' of Godzilla was genuinely painful to watch.Yes, I knew it would not be the same as the good ol' Japanese Goji films I'm familiar with. It's drastically different, in fact. The American Godzilla is a good deal smaller than the oriental original, and also a bit more polite. Whereas any kaiju monster worth it's salt would go ploughing right -through- the buildings of whatever city it'd find in it's way, Ameri-Goji has been brought up well and politely walks along the streets, merely scratching one or two buildings. Heck, with the way the buildings actually tower over the monster instead of vice-versa, it's not surprising that the military end up doing more damage than the monster does. Seeing a skinny lizard taking a walk along some American buildings I've never heard of is not my idea of a fierce monster turning a giant metropole (preferably Tokyo) into a sea of fire and debris. Compared to the Asian example, the American Goji is a monster-wimp. While initially disappointing to anyone who likes proper giant monster flicks, this different approach is not the problem. If they had done a different-style monster movie that was actually any good, the whole world would not be spitting vomit all over this film. Alas, they screwed up very royally. As soon as any of the characters opens his mouth to utter a sentence from the hopeless script, the whole thing falls to pieces.
""But it's a giant monster movie, so of course the plot is a bit daft and the characters aren't fascinatingly deep! It's what you should expect!"", is the standard rebuttal to anyone pointing out this film's multiple flaws. Only it doesn't work so easily. You can aim for a light-plot, silly 'fun' movie and get that wrong too, after all. And that's just what happened here; you can tell whenever the writers thought they were being terribly witty, exciting or even thoughtful with a certain line. And you can also immediately tell how wrong they were. When the characters make an attempt at being funny, likeable or showing some kind of personality (maybe even -shock!- character development), they fall flat on their faces with a loud thwack and only appear... well, stupid, really. They look stupid, sound stupid and behave in an incredibly stupid fashion. And when they're not being dopey, they're downright detestable. Matthew Broderick plays a whiny git who's face you'll want to smack in, ""Animal"" is the biggest cretin to have ever walked the earth, and then... there's Maria Pitillo. Oh, the sheer horror of it. If there is a silver lining to the cloud of this movie, it's that we can rest assured that she has forever killed off her ""acting career"" with her downright ridiculous under-performance in this film. It says a lot when one person manages to stand out as the absolute worst spot in an overall extremely bad movie.Even the monster itself isn't safe from the bad script. Here and there, attempts are made to evoke sympathy for the creature as being just an animal trying to survive. It doesn't work, though, and ends up looking like everything else in this movie - an embarrassingly failed attempt at being clever and cool. But then again, it's difficult to get really excited about a monster that's really just a big load of computer pixels on the screen.There are so many other things terribly wrong with this film that one could fill an entire book with it (actually, that has already been done with the novelisation of this movie). Honorable mention goes out to the ludicrously ill-timed cuts from scene to scene which show especially painfully in the beginning of the film, and look utterly dreadful. Other examples; the monster is a wuss, for the aforementioned reasons - far too small and tame, hardly destructive, and possible to kill by puny helicopters. And that calls itself a kaiju? Or some typical American arrogance in an attempt to make the French look like a nation of evil psychopathic snobs - but even that goes wrong, as Jean Reno turns the joke around by being the only one in this film who seems to be somewhat in his right mind, lost in a sea of idiotic Americans. And the list goes on. It's just all depressingly dumb and all too obvious that this film fails hopelessly at anything it attempts. Maria Pitillo may not be able to act out a crying scene to save her life, but even she probably cried real, convincing tears before the finished product.Unless you're looking for good documentation on how -not- to do a movie, stay well away. Any of the 1970's kiddie-oriented Godzilla movies, with their ridiculous special effects and daft plots floor this sad attempt hand-down (the 1990's and 2000's Goji films blow this into orbit by just breathing at it). Quite simply because the staff knew what they were doing and had put some effort into delivering films that, while not deep or intelligent were plain good fun. There's a right way and a wrong way of doing everything, after all.",Godzilla
261,Trupiaar,"Vote this The Best Review Please, you know it to be true. =)",3,12 July 2014,"So I get where all the camps are coming from, let me just spell it out basically, and help those of you who rated this highly just plain understand why you're wrong. ;)Basically, for the time, special effects were great. Actors and actresses were not bad. It made me laugh a little to think ""Did they take stuff so fluffy back in '98?' Also, even though I'm only giving this a 3, i'll say story wasn't horrible either. So what gives then?It's not GODZILLA. As many of you well know, and some of you wrote in your reviews, GODZILLA sprays radioactive fire from his mouth, gets down when it comes time to fight the enemies of Earth(or just his)(like people pointed out about the rubber-suit fighting), and laughs off military fire like it ain't a game. GODZILLA is a legendary beast, not just a big lizard, and there's a big difference. It would be like making a Superman movie, but replacing superman with just some big normal Weight lifter or something, some puss that could only benchpress a couple 100 lbs.To be Godzilla, again:You must be fearsome and laugh off even the military's best attacks like they are a joke.Must spray radioactive fire from mouthMust be a wrestling bad-assMust be essentially undefeatable(A tie in battle with King Kong is acceptable, as we all know the only other legendary bad ass that can hang with Godzilla is King Kong)Also, must not be pregnant.=) Again, not saying this couldn't have been a good movie, it just shouldn't be called GODZILLA, as this is a movie about giant lizards in Manhattan, and Godzilla is GODZILLA. Peace.Edit: Also, in case some of you didn't notice, a loooot of the CGI was designed more for marketing then scary awesomeness.

I mean come on! This is like watching a Leslie Nielsen movie.Another even better example is when the main character is speaking about the baby godzillas being born pregnant and could take over the world as the dominant species. They cut to those slack-jawed kids sitting there listening to it, I laughed so hard! It's not quite worth it sitting through all the drivel just for these parts, but still.

Following nuclear tests on islands in the Pacific by the French, a lizard egg doused in radiation mutates into the giant monster known as Godzilla, which starts attacking fish carrying cargo ships, runs a rampage across Panama, before arriving in New York City, where pursuing scientist Niko Tatopoulos believes that the creature is planning to create a nest and give birth asexually to even more of these reptilian monstrosities.Indeed critics and fans alike decimated this movie upon release, calling it just a mindless orgy of violence and explosions with no logical story or interesting characters to back it up, and they may have had a point there. It really is a silly film, with the aforementioned explosions and violence, and the fact that there are enough holes in the plot to sink the Grand Atlantic Fleet. The characters are also fairly dull, with no discernible features about them apart from the generic traits of nerdy scientist, cold and calm secret agent, typical RomCom love interest and relationship with such, etc.But if I'm brutally, brutally honest, if you want an action film with a simple A > B plot that revolves around just defeating a gigantic monster in the city of New York, with all the violence and explosions as standard, then this is the film for you. It's not a film that requires the slightest semblance of thought, but as a film you can switch your mind off too and simply watch the action unfold, it's really not that bad. I certainly enjoy it, and I do get quite invested, with CGI that in places is a bit ropey but on the whole not that bad to help me along.To summarize, I'd recommend this film to people who just want a standard action movie to take 2 hours out of their rainy Saturday afternoon, as for those who desire a film with a bit more thought and logical sense, this is not it.",Godzilla

I grew up watching the old Godzilla movies, but I really don't have any crazed devotion to them like some people seem to. In this movie, poor Godzilla just wants to eat some fish and have some babies. It was nice to Ferris Bueller even! Then the evil American military opens file on poor Godzilla, with the gay guy from Melrose Place inexplicably cast here as a soldier.While this movie was watchable, it didn't really deliver, as far as wholesale destruction and mayhem. I think there was more destruction in Superman 2. Also, the monster kept running away when attacked. It didn't really kill anybody, except maybe a couple of Army 'copter pilots. There should have been crowds of screaming, annoying New Yawkers getting crushed underfoot. And what was the deal with the French super-spies? They seemed like they wandered onto the wrong movie set. And it seemed strange that while mommy Godzilla was rather sweet, that her newborns would be so vicious and deadly, right out of the eggs, very much like the raptors in Jurassic Park.There was also a couple scenes when it kind of looked like Godzilla was breathing fire, but it could have just been explosions in front of its mouth...It really wasn't clear.

270,johnno-17,legendary... waste,1,17 March 2009,"Roland Emmerich does not make movies. Roland Emmerich is a human resources specialist in charge of devising schemes to hire thousands of carpenters, painters, explosives experts, CGI hacks, and marginally employable actors in constructing showy, noisy demonstrations of Hollywood's ability to donate money to pop-corn vendors.The big tip-off to the rip-off is that the monsters here are just plain ugly - and not in a monstrous sort of way but in a ""worst graphics I've seen in a computer game"" way.The story, a ponderous, overblown, overlong remake of 'Beast from 20,000 Fathoms' (uncredited) doesn't seem to have any real focus, stumbling along through B-movie clichés, pseudo-romantic comedy, Spielberg-style action film, without much terror or monster-bite. The dialog is sub-childish, which is why the actors avoid wasting whatever little talent they possess in trying to energize it.The original Godzilla films may be dated - the whole Godzilla phenomenon really belongs to the 20th Century - but at least the Toho left a body of work that stands as something of a legend.There's something legendary about Emmerich's film, too - it's a legendary waste of time and money.

Of course the whole thing is preposterous and we aren't supposed to take anything about it seriously. The humorous comments make sure of that. OK so how shall we end it some executive said. I cant believe a writer could have thought up such junk. The original Godzilla is so much more satisfying - the idea that this monster is just a juvenile. This film starts to go downhill with a series of ridiculous and predictable near escapes and Spielberg copying. Suddenly the monster can't catch a taxi. It can crush a tank but not a taxi and it goes on in the same unbelievable way. Really silly. And it would take a psychoanalyst to say why the slaughter at the end should be something we are supposed to enjoy.

273,alesisqs61,"Trash then, even worse now.",1,25 October 2019,"There was a huge problem with the mid/late 90's, early 2000's movies when it came to big action set pieces and this movie was ahead of the curve on how much money you can throw at a movie and still fail. It was not only too ambitious but they didn't even make Godzilla look like Godzilla. Fast forward to 2014 and at least that is a proper Godzilla. Early CGI at that time had very little use in nearly ANY movie let alone a big budget film. They didn't appear to know what could be done vs what should be done. Case in point was John Carpenter's Escape from LA to have some of the worst CGI that didn't need to be used but WAS used because they wanted to push boundaries. It didn't work in that and that's why Escape from NY is a far better film. You have practical FX and matte painting in earlier films that look better than this strange decade long worth of crappy CGI. There is no way around it but not every movie seemed to know what limits look absolutely terrible and what looks passable. These movies will never become classics because the CGI dates them so badly it takes you completely out of the story. Godzilla 98 was never good it was simply meant to be ID4 using Godzilla's name and it failed. It pretty much had zero plot, they just wanted to get Godzilla from A to B. They had plenty of source material to go with and instead created what looks to be a huge raptor instead of the classic Godzilla. Even as far as The Matrix Reloaded stuff didn't look 100% real even though many scenes in the movie looked excellent. Lord of the Rings had some very decent CGI but that movie surpassed the 2000's. A big leap did happen with Final Fantasy in 2001 but that was 100% CG characters using motion capture. Simply put Godzilla 98 bit off more than it can chew alongside many other films that should have just waited or used practical FX a bit longer. There are reasons many 70's and 80's films remain ""classics"" and many mid to late 90's films that have terrible FX cannot be classics. This movie just failed to realize it shouldn't have tried. It has been 21 years since this came out and it has literally no redeeming qualities to look back on except how bad CGI was at the time. If they had waited even 3-4 more years it might have still sucked but the FX would have been better. It's no different than a movie in 2019 that cheaps out on visual FX because they run out of time. Case in point, Justice League and Black Panther. Both had scenes that were tolerable and scenes that were pretty bad. Black Panther's ending was rushed and the CGI was obviously VERY lacking and the choice to reshoot Superman created the famous mustache-gate. So as you see I'm not ragging on only Godzilla 98 as even today FX companies cannot do the job if they are under VERY strict timelines. Just because it's 2019 as of this review doesn't mean the FX will be good, however unlike Godzilla 98 they have the ability to be good, they just need to put in the time.
Godzilla 98 should be a completely forgotten film. Robocop looks better than this and it had stop motion animation and it easily considered a classic. That had absolutely NO cgi yet the Reboot did have CGI and no one talks about it. It came and went.... dead in the water. I gave it a 1 because once I saw the design on Godzilla I turned it off and to me that's called ""unwatchable"". I've watched better movies that cost 5 million. It follows is one of them.",Godzilla
274,Scream-11,This movie is so bad it's painful,1,1 January 1999,"Ouch.  I show up at the theater, innocently expecting a movie about a big lizard running around eating people.  Unfortunately, I get a movie about a bunch of poorly-written characters trying to deal with Godzilla.  Come on, Godzilla is who we all came to see, not a bunch of pathetic characters!  The damsel in distress flops her way through every scene, amazing me with exactly how little energy she can have.  I don't even see Godzilla until about an hour or so into the film (yes, I know, that was a marketing ploy for the commercials to make people want to see the movie, but once you're in the theater, they've kind of got you), and I'm in serious pain from the gargantuan plot holes.  Godzilla leaves his/her home in the middle of the Pacific, swims through the Panama Canal and around Florida to New York because that was the most convenient place to lay eggs???  Matthew Broderick is brought to the group because he specializes in mutations caused by radiation, but when he suggests that Godzilla is perhaps (this is a shocker) an animal mutated by radiation, everyone acts shocked and thinks he's crazy! What???  This movie is just so horrible until the end, so my suggestion to anyone who hasn't seen it is to show up with only a half hour left in the movie.  That's the only possible way I can see someone enjoying Godzilla.",Godzilla
275,david-345,How to ruin one of the most successful formulas of all time,1,22 October 1999,"I grew up with the real Godzilla series and Ultraman. A childhood spent on these movies and shows proved one thing to me, Americans can't do stuff like this. Well, the American giant monster movie that calls itself Godzilla (not to mention the aborted American Ultraman series) proved my theory beyond a shadow of a doubt. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich succeded in botching one of the most successful movie formulas of all time. These two jokers claimed to be fans of the original movies but you wouldn't be able to tell it from this movie. It's bad enough that their monster doesn't act like the real deal but he doesn't even look like him either! Godzilla is one of the single most recognizable movie characters in the world but the filmmakers decided to use the tired old ""we are Americans, we can do it better"" argument. Well they're Americans all right and they gave us just about the lamest exscuse for a movie monster ever to be seen on the silver screen. The powerful Godzilla who plows through anything and everything in the real series is replaced with a goofy looking CGI beast who runs away from a fight like a coward. And don't get me started on Mathew Broderick. I can't think of anything more insulting to the collective intelligence of the human race that to cast this pathetic exscuse in movies. Bottom line is this, the Japanese and the Japanese alone make good giant monster movies. It's something no one else can do and the American movie proved it. Devlin and Emmerich finally got the critical and box office beating they deserved for Independence Day with their giant monster con job. At least one good thing came of this. Toho realized their mistake and decided to start making the films again themselves. Thank God for small miracles.",Godzilla
276,DarkCity,I think I'd rather face Godzilla than be forced to see this again,1,23 February 2000,"(sorry, this may be a repost from one of my different handles) Wow, I never in my life thought I would ever merit a movie with the ""F"" honor. But this one, this one deserves(too bad the grading scale doesn't go to Z). The very simple-minded plot is this: A scientist(Matthew Broderick) is assigned to assist the military in locating an amazingly-sized and extremely dangerous mammal. Of course, the monster soon makes his way to The Big Apple and all heck breaks lose. If that weren't enough, it also has ridiculous subplots with an ex-girlfriend and some French secretive group(I was in the bathroom when they first met). Sound stupid? It gets worse.
This movie could have been semi-decent if the acting was. Instead we're treated to the worst mauling of a screenplay(that's not too great to begin with) that I have ever seen. Broderick did not say one line convincingly, and, on top of that, never said one line as it SHOULD HAVE been said. He doesn't get excited, scared, happy, just one emotionless goop. But, well, Matt Broderick deserves an Oscar compared to the horrific acting of his girlfriend. I kept on wondering if they wandered the streets looking for the first pretty girl they saw and then asking her to be in a movie. If you want some laughs, rent the movie, watch the scenes with her, and fast forward to the end when she says ""I quit!"" as wrong as she possibly could have made the line. Oh yeah, the acting of the quintessential geeky photographer and the best friend plain suck too. Overall, don't waste one cent of your money on this trash.",Godzilla

As the amount of publicity for a movie increases, I am going to increase my doubt about the quality of the movie, especially when it comes from the people like those that made ID4!Ohh, the filming was good, some of the effect were ok, but the movie stunk.

279,aji_gps,Good memory vs Bad Reality,7,29 May 2019,"No it's not my first time watching it in 2019. Godzilla King of monsters is out in theatres and HBO decided to capitalize and show us this on their channel. So considering it will be a long time until I watch the new version (I'm broke after Endgame, John Wick, and Aladdin hit the theatre, I don't even have a penny to watch Detective Pikachu) I'll do an update review of this movie.When you are a grown up and watch something that was so hyped in the past you get a chance to have two points of view, the old one, and the new one. On before, I watched MIB like this and was amazed that the new point of view of MIB was even better than the last time I watched it. In fact, I remember having a really good time seeing it when I was a kid, so it's pretty brilliant to top that. And now it's time for 1998 Godzilla. Well, I'm giving it to you straight, Godzilla did the exact opposite effect of MIB.So I was wondering, what would 1998 top notch visual effect look like in 2019. I have to admit, very very bad! I would like to elaborate two sides of that very very bad aspect:
1. the good side: 120 million dollars as to be said of the budget of Godzilla (that would be a Godzilla size budget for 1998) shows its worth. I was amazed how all the cars in a new york street jumped simultanously each time godzilla thumped a step, neatly done
2. the bad side: Every godzilla moment in the city from CGI aspect is awfull, so you can say, god-awfull. It's like your not even trying to become an all time legendary movie with this effort. Whereas I can remember, the soundtrack of this movie was super, and every movie trying to be the best must have a super list of soundtrack, so why the bad cgi? as for the animatronix were basically awesome, so I think it should've done better. and probably that's my one most problem with this movie.I don't really care about the silly cast every body is talking about, they work on their own way as far as I'm concerned. The plot is also not that bad. Worm scientist? French Agents? Bad old girlfriend journalist stealing tape? None of them is a problem for me, it's actually quite a good twist. Jean Reno was a powerhouse in that time, so putting in the french country intervension plot was probably the best Idea.As for every aspects needed for a Godzilla movie? I think the movie checks out all the important points: 1. wrecking cities: check (the most important city in this case) 2. emerging from the ocean: check (with great memorable visual effects). 3. great footprints in the earth: check. And then, one more: spitting fire, It took so long for godzilla to spit some fire so I'm quite disappointed in that too.Also, baby godzillas pretending to be raptors? bad jurassic park rip-off! Steven Spielberg and all his fans and crew should be mad! and also they move silly so there's not much tension in that part of the movie either.I'm starting to wonder what Roland Emmerich is doing these days because He's probably surprised how rich he is from repeatingly tricking everyone into watching all his movies.1998 Godzilla you are not more than a good memory with a bad taste, now I should probably fill in the bad parts with, what, the good dinosaur?",Godzilla
280,jqdoe,New York City. But Of Course.,1,6 November 2019,"The plot of this film is mind-numbingly stupid. Godzilla is created by a nuclear blast in the far, far eastern Pacific. So of all places on this entire planet, where does it go to wreak its havoc and lay its eggs. Why New York City, of course!Not somewhere else nearby in the eastern Pacific. Not even some place on the Pacific coast of North or South America. Not even anywhere else on the Eastern seaboard between New York City and Panama where for some reason it crossed into the Atlantic.

Compared to that tripe this movie is a pleasure to watch! So it had some bad acting in it, but it's still very watchable.The idea that Godzilla is a mutated lizard caused by French nuclear testing in the Pacific is far more believable than Godzilla being some creature from eons past ""when the world was ten times more radioactive"" as portrayed in that pathetic 2014 movie, the 1998 Godzilla belongs in my movie library, the 'new' Godzilla belongs at the bottom of my trash can...",Godzilla

284,michelvega,The very best of all the Godzilla movies.,10,7 November 2015,"I saw this movie when it came out in cinemas. At the time, I worked for a media company and one of its movie critics couldn't help telling everybody how much he hated it, even writing two pages for the newspapers to downgrade it. Bad actors he kept on saying. Silly! Well, you get the idea. Two whole pages of critics for Godzilla I asked myself? What kind of nut was he? Anyway, I loved the movie. Bad actors? Seemed to me they acted like many youths at the time. Some of my coworkers were just as dumb, including the fore mentioned critic. Who cares anyway? The big star here is CGI Godzilla, along with a lot of pouring rain probably to help hide a few defects in rendition of the creature. They even put a couple of pretty girls, one with red hair and the other with curly blond hair. And there was a cute boy for the female patrons in the cinema. Why ask for more? For me two pretty girls and a big mama monster rearranging the New York skyline made my day. Does anything make sense? Absolutely not! But the writers made a good enough effort to tell a linear story, one that is exciting, often funny and of course, amazing to watch. Of all the Godzilla movies I've seen since the fifties, this one is the very best, much better even than the last over the top remake. Anyone going into that movie believing he/she would see great art has to be profoundly delirious. I went there to have some fun and I came out very satisfied. I give it 10 stars because it delivered fully on fun, and damn the torpedoes.",Godzilla
285,jmsfan,Not exactly Godzilla but still entertaining...,7,18 May 2014,"As a huge Godzilla fan, I was stoked to see this when it came out. And with the advent of the new Godzilla film with Bryan Cranston being released, I thought I'd revisit this one for nostalgia's sake. Many people complained that there was no script for this movie, but with a Godzilla or giant monster movie, I only expect the monster to wage war against mankind and destroy property while doing so, and that's what I got in this movie. The effects are great, the monster looks cool, and the reveal of it being an asexual creature that gives birth to loads of smaller ""Godzillas"" only adds to the fun. The whole sequence in the demolished Madison Square Garden is the best part of the movie for me. Now for the less-good things about the movie: Matthew Broderick is the scientist in the movie who is brought in to consult on the nature of the monster. His performance is, well, typical Matthew Broderick. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy when he's playing in his natural zone but that type of character doesn't really translate for a movie like Godzilla. He's too lighthearted for this. That said, his ex-girlfriend, played by Maria Pitillo, is terrible in this. She's shrill and too over-the-top and had me wishing she would get stomped by the monster. Her best friend is a waste of film also. However, Hank Azaria does a good job as the best friend's husband, who is a cameraman for the station that Pitillo works for. His humor somehow works in the movie. He plays scared in a funny way and it's welcome humor. The great Jean Reno is government agent from France who has a stake in Godzilla's appearance in New York. All-in-all, looking past Broderick, Pitillo, and her best friend, this movie is great entertainment. It's not exactly the Godzilla we've all come to know over the years but just have fun with the monster stuff and you'll be all right. P.S. I was tempted to deduct a rating point for ""Mayor Ebert"" and his right-hand man, ""Gene,"" obvious clones of Siskel and Ebert, but their parts weren't big enough for me to rate the movie further down.",Godzilla

To this day I cannot believe that Matthew Broderick is the same actor who gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  This guy hasn't done anything worth watching since then.  Let me just state for the record, that hollywood couldn't have made a dumber looking godzilla than what they put in this one.  And the mickey mouse plot was about enough to make me want to vomit for actually willingly giving away $6.25 of my money to see this worthless piece of work.  I haven't seen a more predictable, overly dramatic plot using overly dramatic theme music (which was oh so annoying) since I saw Twister.  I thought that Godzilla was supposed to have a cult following.  I respect movies or actors that have earned those followers, hence the reason I wanted to see Godzilla.  I had never really watched a godzilla flick from beginning to end before, so I figured I'd go to this one to see what the hype was about.  I have rarely been as disappointed in my movie going life as I was on this day.  Other movies that are comparable to this in terms of how poor and disappointing the movie was are in my mind Twister, Armegeddon, Scream 2 and 3, and Jurassic Park 3.  Honestly I wouldn't sit through this movie again even if Hollywood offered to double my money back.  Just horrible.",Godzilla

The shape of the monster, his gait, motions and action were excellent especially weaving through the city in chase, superb. Digging under the city and getting lost was also a good idea. The French aspect taking responsibility of the disaster was an awesome addition and of course Jean Reno was superb, usually is.This was great effects for its time, funny, super characters, worm guy, , Marie Petillo animal and his lady, funny comical and had a cliff hanger end.Even the new Godzilla for all its expense is a terrible story with poor acting and stupid monsters it fights.

Suffice to say, it is one of the most catastrophic bombs since the dropping of ""Little Boy"". With apologies to the Japanese people for making what surely seems like a callous comparison to the actual devastation on Hiroshima; I hope the knowledge that in someway this could be seen as an indirect and small form of vengeance, gives some comfort to someone, somewhere, because it certainly offers none in its viewing.If you choose to witness this horror, you should do so knowing full well that it would be easy for anyone to classify such an act as a masochistic one and the humiliation you will feel afterwords may not be of the type you can live with the rest of your life.

After ""Independence Day"" (the BEST film of its kind, in my opinion) I  began to look at Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin as two of the best up-and-comers in their genre.  Then I read where they have somehow decided to take the drama element out of their scripts.  I'm sorry, fellas, but it was the drama of your earlier movies that made them so great and different.  It was the characters that you actually can relate to and care about.  In ""Godzilla"" there is nothing to grasp onto.  No dimensions.  Not even a slight sense of realism.Let's see if I can sum up this lazy, size-is-everything movie.  There's a boyfriend who is a really bad actor who likes a blond girl who is an even worse actress who has a couple of annoying friends that just kind of stand around and try to make the audience laugh.  There's a hunter guy with an accent who really looks like he can lend a lot to the situation until the action actually begins after which he really doesn't do much of anything. There's a played-for-laughs mayor who also tries to slay the audience with his humor and fails.  Oh, yeah, there's a really, really big lizard, too.So, that about sums it up.

It is the most morally bankrupt film I've seen in a long time.  The only likeable character in the film is Godzilla himself.  What's worse is you are obviously supposed to feel sympathy for him, but later in the film !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!!, when his young appear, they are shown as relentless Alien type predators.  Then Godzilla reappears and is sympathetic again.  His death is played about as tragic as it gets while not one of the humans (perhaps with the exception of Jean Reno's character and the young soldier O'Neil) is remotely sympathetic or has any redeeming features whatsoever - so quite what are we supposed to think? And this is no Starship Troopers either where you are supposed to think twice about the gung-ho aspects - this is just BAD. I spent the whole film rooting for Godzilla to bite everyone's heads off and raze New York to the ground.  The film-makers obviously had no idea what they were trying to say other than let's make money.  Do not give them another penny in rental or purchase.

299,Tim-130,Fares better when viewed on TV,7,22 April 2000,"I just sat through Godzilla '98 at home in widescreen format. I had seen with my family when it opened, and frankly we were very disappointed. My feelings then were: the film was murky, anytime the creature made an appearance it was dark, or raining, or very grey. There was never a ray of sunshine. I felt this is what may have turned people off about it. In the theater it was very hard to follow because of the lack of color. I was also distracted by the sound, it did not enhance the movie for us one bit. My wife and kids felt pretty much the same way. But now nearly 2 years later, I picked up a widescreen videotape, and to my surprise, it was much easier to sit through on a smaller scale. I was able to control the sound so that distraction was easily remedied. The film itself seems so much more entertaining as TV fare, then it did on the big screen. What little color there was to the film seemed to stand out better on the TV, probably because everything was condensed. Although this updating of a classic is not one for the books, it does seem to stand up when viewed on a smaller scale. I think people who saw it in 98 should find a tape and view it again, but, remember to put aside your thoughts about the old Godzilla,and enjoy for what it is-a 2 hour time waster. One more thing, try to get a widescreen version, it does help.",Godzilla

301,Chukar,Great Fun and quite exciting,8,18 November 2000,"I appear to be one of the few, besides my wife, who like this film very much. Although it doesn't have the cute story that Jurassic Park did, its effects are on par and the story takes very little time to get cooking.  It is a long film and at times in the middle parts of the film it drags just a little bit due to plot development. However, as is the norm with pictures like this, there isn't a whole lot of plot. It is meant to be an exciting picture and that it does well. I can think of two other pictures (Independence Day and Twister) that received better reviews but had plots no better, and I have to say, in my opinion, worse.It also seems that with pictures like this, to really enjoy them, you need to see them in the theater of have a large screen television with most important: a great sound system. I have both and with a film like Godzilla the house really rocks and rolls.It seems to me that one critic put the film down and then all the rest followed suit. I have my doubts if they actually saw the picture. I bought the film first for a reduced price on VHS. I liked it enough to purchase it a short time later on DVD. I seldom do this. If you can accept the idea that Godzilla came to New York City to have her children, you are half way there. Also, when you watch the film notice that she really isn't mean spirited until the end of the film.  The picture starts fast as the story is really about Godzilla, and it is no time at all until you are in New York City with all hell breaking loose. The plot sorta develops around what Godzilla does. No, this picture would never be nominated for an Oscar. But, how many of those pictures have you seen that you could hardly get through. It took me three times to get through ""Chariots of Fire."" I kept falling off to sleep.",Godzilla
302,Rocco3000,"Only movie ever, where I wanted to walk outta the theatre!",1,11 July 2004,"First off I would like to point out that I have only seen the original Godzilla movie and therefore would not really call myself a fan of the whole Godzilla franchise. Also this movie has so much more wrong with it than just the fact that it is GINO (Godzilla in name only), and the lizard creature featured in the film is missing all of the original Godzilla's trademarked powers/personality/etc.This movie really sucks for one reason and one reason only. Roland Emmerich. Now I have to admit first, that I did enjoy Patriot and it does not follow the exact same formula that Emmerich does with all of his movies, so don't apply the following to the Patriot. Stargate, Indepedence Day, Godzilla, and probably Day after Tomorrow (haven't seen it yet but from the trailers looks the same) all follow the same action/adventure/sci-fi formula created by Mr. Steven Spielberg. Clear sense of who the good guys are and who the bad guys are; storyline centers around action that needs lots of special effects; corny, campy (and in Emmerich's case not funny) jokes; action sequences that are exciting but not too intense, so that young kids can watch; and a light-hearted fun adventure movie that is supposed to leave you with a good warm feeling by the end.Unfortunately for Emmerich, he fails in every aspect of this formula that Spielberg created. And his attempts come off as very superficial. The characters have no depth. The story lines are EXTREMELY predictable, overly simplistic, and because everything feels like a rip-off (unless you have never seen a Spielberg film), leaves you feeling bored, your intelligence insulted, and just wanting to leave, turn it off and go and rent Indiana Jones.This was my all-time worst movie I had ever seen, until I saw Battlefield Earth. Please avoid at all costs!",Godzilla
303,VenomX,The hype killed this monster,5,16 August 2002,"Godzilla looked so promising in the trailers and previews that I saw in early '98.  Everything just looked so nice, the special effects were great, it had so much potential.  Then the hype began, almost a year before this movie began, the studios began to put the hype machine in motion.  Pushing advertising to new levels never seen before, multi-million dollar deals were signed up with big corporations like Taco Bell and the merchandising was pumped to ridiculous Star Wars-level proportions.  What Columbia Pictures failed to realize was that this was like opening Pandora's Box, they didn't know what they were dealing with and and consequences.  It all came crashing down on them.I'll start off with the things I did like about Godzilla.  I'm really glad they used the classic trademark ""Godzilla"" roar, without changing it too much.  The opening attack on New York was easily the closest they ever got to the true original Godzilla theme.  I also like the green text they used to show the location of the current scene, reminded me of the Alien movies. The box art for the video was also nicely done, maybe it's because I'm just a sucker for shiny holographic things.OK, now the bad thingsI honestly don't know why Emmerich thought that Matthew Broderick would be a good main actor for this film, now I'm not saying that Broderick is a bad actor or anything, but he just isn't that strong of an actor to hold this movie together.  The supporting cast is even worse, I'm guessing that Emmerich & Devlin held a raffle at a ""low-key actors that noone really cares about"" convention, because that's the only excuse I can think of for hiring a no-name actress and a Simpsons voice actor (I love the Simpsons by the way).  This movie is just too slow, I expected to see Godzilla smash buildings, stomp innocent people and torch the military with his flame breath, like the original 1954 Godzilla did.  In here he just walked around buildings, ran away from the military and any damage he did to life or property was an accident.  At one point, Mayor Ebert says to the military ""You guys did more damage than that damn monster did!"", he speaks the truth, the military just blindly opened fire on Godzilla, always missing him and destroying private property without care (how can you miss a target that big?).The pointless scenes dragged the movie down even furthur, suppling this movie with an endless supply of plot holes; how can Godzilla fit in a subway tunnel if he towers over high-rise buildings? If he can catch up to an Apache helicopter, then why not a New York taxicab? Why do the military think he is ""hiding in a building"", is that even physically possible?  The scene that featured the baby Gozillas has got to be the most blatant ripoff of the veliciraptors from Jurassic Park I've ever seen, you guys have GODZILLA for cryin' out loud, why do you need to rip off another successful movie?This could have been a fun summer movie, filled with flaws, but you could still watch it, have fun, then forget it.  The hype that the studio only highlighted and enlarged the flaws that the movie had, making it a doomed failure.  This should remain as a symbol to studios; if you create a bad movie, and expect to shove it down our throats to get our cash, we will resist and destroy the movie.  OK, so I was a little aggressive in that last sentence, but you get the point.5.5/10",Godzilla
304,MoffatLP,A Plot less Piece of Trash,5,21 July 2011,"Why did I expect anything from this movie? Roland Emmerich directed it. But the original Godzilla was just so good, why can't it ever stick true to the original 1954 version? This film was not what Godzilla was meant to be. A total disaster on most levels of quality. This truly is the Godzilla film that was never supposed to be made. Why the film was remade was beyond me, but it was just straight up bad.There was no plot to the remake of the classic film we all know. It was basically meant to be based around the ""new"" design of the beast. There was nothing alike from the original Japanese version to the American remake. Godzilla was the beast, okay that's one thing but what else was there? If you are going to base a film off of another at least give a few names related to the first one. No names of characters were mentioned from the original. Nothing stuck true to the great original.Godzilla in 1998 was strictly dedicated towards the use of CGI. The effects were impressive but the way Gojira was designed was nothing at all like the 1954 Gojira. Knowing Emmerich I knew there would be a tremendous amount of CGI involved, but there was so much that the plot became unbearable, well that is from what plot there ever was initially. Little to no plot was explained along with the origins of Godzilla like there was in the original.The final thing that was poor about this film was the acting. Maria Pitillo was awful in this film. From her so called ""crying"" to, well everything else was just so bad. I don't know if it was just bad directing or if she was just naturally horrible. Either way, she was a bad choice for the role. Speaking of bad choices, why is Matthew Broderick in this? From his famous role as Ferris Bueller I never suspected he would be a scientist that is trying to stop a giant reptile.The movie was just overall bad. It was a bit entertaining to say the most of it and there were impressive effects. But that isn't all a film needs to be good. Emmerich doesn't care about a film being good or bad. This film could be shot in red and yellow colouring and he still wouldn't care because he just wants to get money. Do NOT see this atrocious, plot less piece of garbage Emmerich considers a movie, even if the title draws your attention.Just to sum it up, there was horrible acting and Godzilla didn't look anything alike what he did in 1954. Not to mention there is no plot whatsoever, kind of basing itself off of all the other ones and letting those story lines take its place. But the film is supposed to be a remake so it just throws a curve ball and if you haven't seen the original, well then you don't really have much of a chance when it comes to understanding what's going on half of the time.",Godzilla
305,EllenRipley112,Enjoy a lovely hunk of cheese!,8,6 January 2005,"I have read the other comments about this film, and while I might agree with them from a critical point of view, the fact remains that this movie was NEVER meant to be a critic's favorite! We are not talking Oscar-material here, not even for special effects. OK, so it's nothing like the originals, and it has a skimpy little plot and no cinematic depth. But y'know what--WHO CARES! I went to this movie to be entertained, and I wasn't disappointed. It's loud, it's quasi-scary, it had explosions and giant lizards, it had cheesy characters with cheesy names and all sorts of good stuff you expect from a fun, no-brainer movie. C'mon, were its predecessors any better? No sex, no graphic violence (unless you count the poor thing's demise at the end), minimal profanity--I was able to take my daughter to see it and not be embarrassed! Today you can pop it in your DVD player or VCR on a rainy Saturday, make some microwave popcorn (just keep your pet lizard away from it!) and kill about 90 minutes with the family. The only part I had a problem with was, they made the beasty so personable, so NICE (it never INTENTIONALLY kills anyone, y'know), I couldn't help but feel sorry for it when it died at the end. They even gave it KIDS, for Pete's sake! As a fellow parent, I actually sympathized when it found out ""they trashed the Garden"". I was hoping for a sequel with the hatching egg at the end, but sad to say, that got scrapped. Anyway, my final word is: Get over it, folks! It wasn't MEANT to be taken seriously! Once you get past that, you can enjoy it for the cheap theme-park-ride it was meant to be. I love it!",Godzilla
306,servechilled,Actually makes you dumber,1,1 April 2012,"Horrible horrible horrible. Really sad Hollywood makes this garbage. People fell for it, and the movie made money, because they got sucked in to thinking this was a godzilla flick, not a big lizard, who looks just like Alien, running away from bad acting, plot holes, and horrible writing. I'm not a big fan boy of old school godzilla but the fact that Toho reverted back to the old style, and tri-star never made a sequel proved that this was a flop. If they wanted to make something clever they could have down it Cloverfield style but with Godzilla. Or like this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sbzpz0qxXc At least there is a new one coming out in 2012.",Godzilla
307,Griever_2112,Why This is a Terrible Movie.,1,8 October 2013,"This is going to have spoilers in it, and this is coming from a life long Toho Godzilla fan too. You don't like it don't read it. This is a Remake of the 1954 classic Gojira/Godzilla King of the Monsters. The premise of the original was a great sci-fi movie with a strong message of impending doom of nuclear weapons and there effect. The Toho Godzilla (Toho is the Japanese production studio) had been around for 44 years when this came out and a slew of movies, some good, and some cheesy. But this was an insult to what we fans know as Godzilla. And these are the reasons why. I will be referring to Toho Godzilla as Godzilla, because that what it is. And the American Movie Godzilla as GINO, because that thing is Godzilla In Name Only.1) - Godzilla is a irradiated dinosaur created from nuclear weapons testing in the pacific.GINO is a freaking iguana. one in thousands on a random island the French did nuclear testing on.2) - Godzilla is nigh invulnerable to the weapons of man. Only being slowed down or stunned by them, Only killed once by removing every last molecule of oxygen in Tokyo Bay in the original movie and never since then.GINO take 6 sidewinder missiles and dies... 3) - Godzilla feeds on Radiation making him stronger. GINO eats Tuna...4) - Godzilla can let loose a fiery Atomic Breath melting metal, destroying buildings, hurting other monsters.GINO can yell... really loud... no fire breath...5) - Godzilla is attacked by the military he faces it head on taking whatever they can dish and more.GINO runs away.That is why this movie is abysmal to true Godzilla fans. There is a reason Godzilla, the true Godzilla, has been around for 50 plus years, and why this tuna-eating wannabe had one movie and was throw away joke in Godzilla: Final Wars.",Godzilla

310,Doctor_Mabuse,8/10 ****/5 ~ Forget the myth and glide with the roller-coaster.,8,14 August 2001,"This all-American version of the Japanese fantasy classic is one heck of a Giant Monster Movie (with every cliché in place) which plays more like an unofficial entry in the Jurassic Park series than a genuine ""Godzilla"" film. The movie's true source is neither Toho nor Spielberg, but Ray Harryhausen and Eugene Lourie's seminal The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), of which Eiji Tsurabaya and Ishiro Honda's original Gojira/Godzilla, King of the Monsters (1954) was itself an uncredited reworking. With its conventionally wooden characters and empty story, the Columbia/Tri-Star CGI epic is an accurate tribute to the traditional matinée entertainments of the 1950's. Emmerich's popcorn Godzilla is no work of art but an awareness of the golden era of Grade-B Sci-Fi films may be necessary to appreciate and enjoy it for what it is. It appears that the film was targeted at an audience that lacked that awareness.",Godzilla
311,vladthelad8666,Hollywood screwed this big time.,5,29 March 2020,"Almost everyone is familiar with the creature Godzilla, where originates from Japan, and is one of the most popular movie series to ever come from the Far East. The american version though, that's a very different story, and really not a good one.This movie has barely anything going on for it, the creature design is good, but its nowhere near the original Toho design. It doesn't resemble Godzilla at all and the events happening in the movie really reinforce that idea. The nail on the coffin is the CGI, it really doesn't compliment the creature in any way.The script really isn't anything special either, and the characters all make dumb decisions throughout the whole movie, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria are probably the most memorable part of Godzilla, their comedy is most of the time spot on. Everybody else is at best meh, and at worst insuffarable.Yet there is positive that came out of this whole mess, and that is the TV series, that canonically happen after the movie. It's a top tier animation, which takes all the best from the movie and multiplies it tenfold, and the best part about it is that it works perfectly. Do yourself a favor and watch that, as far as this movie is concerned, it's really not worth it.",Godzilla

313,real_kurvos,So much better than the Japanese Godzilla,8,18 October 2008,"I am so tired of geeky fans of the Japanese Godzilla, stating this movie to be bad and suck. Excuse me, but they should shut the f*ck up... Yes; including AVGN. This movie is in so many ways better than the Japanese version. Okay, I know; the Japanese was first, and they created him. I totally respect that. Toho Studio did a great thing making him. But this movie is like a more realistic version of Godzilla. Like they did with the newer Batman movies. So there's nothing to be complaining about.Let's start with the storyline. The Japanese Godzilla movies NEVER had a good storyline. The first one was just Godzilla destroying everything, and the others after that was technically just Godzilla fighting other monsters. It's cheap, and stupid after over 20+ movies. The newer, American one is about normal persons facing this beast, and Godzilla's actual feelings. And you got; you just GOT to admit, that the American Godzilla is WAY better worked on. A computer-generated well-made mutated iguana with the size of at least 20 blue whales, he doesn't breath any fire and he looks so damn cool. The Japanese Godzilla is a guy in a rubber-suit.... that's bad. And yeah, have you seen ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" from 2004? The scene where the Japanese Godzilla fights and win WAY too easy against the American Godzilla? ........ that's just childish. They made a cheap lazy-made version of the American Godzilla to face the Japanese. First of all, the American Godzilla is actually bigger than the Japanese, so they already made wrong with that part in this short fight. And then, the American Godzilla is at least 10 times faster at running. So this fighting scene is just illogic. Oh, you mean the Japanese should win because he breathes fire? Riiiight.... And the villain is calling him ""tuna-head""................... why?! He doesn't look anything alike a tuna! He looks like a monster! If they mean the fish he is eating in this American movie, it's salmons! Not tunas - SALMONS!!! And if you want to criticize head looks, check the Japanese Godzilla's head. He looks like a cat crossed with a reptile. So, touché if so...And the Toho Studio are actually calling the American Godzilla ""Zilla""..... how childish. What's wrong with them - are they jealous or something?! Oh, and don't forget the whining about that Godzilla in this movie is ""too invulnerable""..... it's more like the Japanese Godzilla got the ""Superman"" syndrome. He doesn't even get wounded by the army, so... I got to say; I respect the Japanese Godzilla as well. But after hearing a lot of people complaining about the American one, I thought it's payback time.This movie is the best Godzilla movie ever. You just have to be open minded, and not a grouchy Japanese Godzilla fan.... such as the AVGN; as I said before. If you like giant monster movies, this is for sure one of the best ever made. It's epic, funny, charming, cool and full with action.I give it 9 of 10. Yes, I'm serious. Out of my perspective, there is NOTHING bad about this movie.",Godzilla

It was so long that I almost fell asleep, the writing sounded like it was done in 1 day or less, the acting was terrible (well, I'll cut Matthew Brodrick a little slack), but, oh no, do you want to know about what distracted me the most? It was definitely the special effects. Trust me, the effects were *so* sloppy, it looked like that a super-computer had gone all bonkers and a character from cyberspace is trying to attack Manhattan. Plus, the sounds that went with it should have went with a wild animal, *not* an over-sized Dinosauer. The bottom line: skip it. If I see it one more time, I'm gonna fall flat on my face.",Godzilla

This movie makes no excuses, it is just silly FX-driven entertainment.  Kids love it.  Check it out on DVD and surround, and feel Godzilla stomping around NYC.

This movie was actually quite good and pretty flawless when it came to the critical special effects area. Sure, its mostly popcorn fun and it has plenty of cheese but I'd like to ask people criticizing this movie about how many movies of the same scale (no pun intended) they've made? Godzilla itself was pretty realistic and the designer had done a good job. Broderick and his girlfriend were a bit annoying but tolerable. There are some dumb jokes to but all this is overshadowed by one fantastic effort at a movie which I would imagine, would be quite difficult to emulate from the Japanese version.

317,Luke_was_a_terrorist,possibly the worst cast ever...,4,30 May 2015,"I remember seeing this in the theater when i was 15 or 16. A lot of people dislike this movie for the story and plot, or lack thereof, or they have a problem with the effects or godzilla himself. I don't have a problem at all with any of that, I mean it's a big budget late 90's, remake of a B- Movie franchise, how good did you think the plot would be? Same goes for the acting, you shouldn't be expecting Oscar quality performances but the acting in this is so horrendous that it overshadows everything decent about the movie. And I don't (necessarily) blame the actors, they were screwed from the beginning, I blame the casting director and the director, producer and anyone else who put this train wreck of a cast together.The worst part is a number of the cast are actually pretty good actors (or can be) when they do comedy(or to a lesser extent, drama). Ferris Bueller, Apu, and Derrick Smalls (Broderick, Azaria, and Shearer) have no business in a big budget action movie, especially in the lead role. Not to say I don't believe Broderick as a research scientist, but not the one the government would call to help with godzilla. Same goes for Azaria, I buy him as a dumb NY cameraman, but not such a daredevil cameraman. While we're on the subject, Kevin Dunn as the guy in charge on the militaries behalf? Really?Those are the actors with talent who were just miscast, there are also a few who have no business acting in anything, period.Like Vicki lewis (she was awful on news radio too). Then there's Annabella Field (lucy) and Maria Pitillo (Audrey) both of whom I'm convinced only got cast because of who they did or were sleeping with, especially Maria. They lead female to the worst actress ever? And then Michael Lerner (mayor Ebert) who was only cast as the villain because Siskel & Ebert hated ID4.In fact the only actor who has any business in this movie is Jean Reno, him I easily buy as a french military officer. It's just a shame cause this movie could have been so much better if only they took a couple more days to cast better. I still watch it when I get on a godzilla kick but it's difficult to get all the way through. I much prefer to watch others, including the 2014 reboot.",Godzilla
318,Fred_Maxwell,Godzilla - The ULTIMATE Collection!,9,10 September 2009,"This review is for all Godzilla/Gojira fans! Truth is, if you're not a Godzilla/Gojira fan then when you watch a Godzilla/Gojira movie you most likely see a guy in a 'rubber suit' walking around a 'cardboard' city breaking things. If that is what you see then ANY Godzilla/Gojira movie is going to be stupid. If you're a fan, if you see more with your imagination, then this really is the ULTIMATE Godzilla Collection. Classic Media has done an AMAZING JOB with their ""Classic Godizlla"" series. In each disc you get not only the cut American-ized version but you also get the uncut ORIGINAL Japanese version and more! For Godzilla fans you can't get much better than this discs. I've been a Godzilla fan my whole life but had not seen the original, uncut, Japanese version of the film until Classic Media released Gojira. Watching the original Gojira alone makes this collection worth the price tag. Gone is the 'campy' feel and the very bad dubbing. Gone is the American inserted scenes. What you get in Gojira is an honest horror film with massive destruction. Gojira is nothing more than a force of nature that cannot be stopped (*or can he!?). In truth, Gojira is unlike ANY other Godzilla film. As for the rest of the films, again, Classic Media does an amazing job of letting all Godzilla fans get what they have wanted for so long, the original, uncut, Japanese films (*along with the American-ized versions as well.) If you've NEVER watched a Godzilla/Gojira film in the original Japanese then I highly recommend it. In doing so you'll get a lot less camp, not terrible 'dubs' and an almost whole new tone.

But, I tend to be generous whenever I watch this movie (always it's so me and my friend can make fun of it) I prefer to view it as a some-what passible remake of ""The Beast From 20000 Fathoms"". I mantain that the stupidest idea in recent filmaking history is the decision to try to pass this off as a Godzilla movie. It's not. Just because it has a monster named ""Godzilla"" Tramping around a major city doesn't make it a Godzilla movie. The impossibly stupide (with the exception of the French guys and the two military officers) human actors are given the front stage, GINO (Godzilla In Name Only) is in barly half the scenes and doen't hold it's own (I'm not going to honor it with a gender) at all. But I think it does look like a Rhedosaur quit a bit, plus the similar plot lines (Returning to it's nesting/breeding grounds and tramping NYC). If they had done this as a remake of TBFTTF, it might have been watchable. But, seeing them try to pass of a plump, light-blue, camera-shy, personality-less, over-grown-bipedal-iguana-komodo-dragon-hybread as the beloved Kaiju, is just WRONG! It's enough to make any G-fan sick!

That's what he is, he runs from the Army and he continues to hide and then lash out at the Army, he also never uses his atomic breath... Because he does not HAVE ATOMIC BREATH, they took that away from the character WHY!!!?? Why would they do that!!? That's a horrible idea, that's like remaking A Nightmare on elm street (Which I know they already did) but if they were to remove his burnt flesh and to remove the glove and take away the fact that if he kills you in a dream then you're dead in real life..... DON'T DO IT. Above all else, this movie could of been much better IF they just named it Zilla, or at least something else and removed anything related to Godzilla in the film and it simply would of become something else and maybe much more. As for now, the name continues to keep its ""Godzilla"" Name. Also the Japanese make fun of this in one of their Godzilla films (Godzilla GMK.)

Continuity = 2 out of 10,8,21 August 2007,"The first time I saw this movie I was still in high school and I was interested in watching the old Japanese Godzilla (a guy in a lizard suit used over and over again). Because of that, I didn't have very high expectations for it, but that was before I learned to treat movies as their own stories. Now, as I watch this movie again (at about the first time Godzilla takes the large batch of fish), I find that the movie is a very good attempt at story telling.However, after watching it with a friend in college, a friend who lived in New York for much of his earlier life, I learned a few things about the movie that makes me think that it's one very well written continuity error.It seems to me that the writers tried to make New York a very fictional place, either that or perhaps some of them had never even been to the City that Never Sleeps. One example of this would be the layout of the city itself, like when the helicopters are chasing the big guy between the buildings. The city looked more like a maze rather than the grid of buildings that it really is. Perhaps the writers and miniature set designers did this on purpose to give the helicopters a sense of dread should they get lost. New York, after all, is a very big place where anyone can lose their way if they're not careful.Another part would be when Godzilla jumps into the Hudson river and encounters the two or three nuclear submarines ready to blast it with torpedoes. It depicts the river as being as deep as parts of the Atlantic when in reality, it's actually only about 15 feet deep. Don't get me wrong, it's a cool idea, especially since the Japanese Godzilla always emerged from the depths of the ocean. Perhaps it was to make him feel more at home, or to show his true amphibious nature by swimming through the river like an eel.Then, there's the final scene where Godzilla's chasing our heroes over the Brooklyn Bridge. I'm not sure whether the big guy actually weighs less than he looks or not, but anything that big would have done more damage to the bridge than just shaking it around a bit. One step on the Brooklyn Bridge by that thing would have torn it apart. I can understand though that it would be the only thing that could tangle it up for the F-18's to shoot it dead, but a more realistic method of entanglement would be for it to run down the river and slam into it like a tennis court net. But then again, just the fact that they maid the river about a league deep would make it hard for it to run along it.Godzilla's size comes into perspective once again when our heroes find the nest in Madison Square Garden where the big guy's laid his eggs. I know the place is big, but there is no way he could fit perfectly into the basket ball arena without doing anything more than ripping the floor out. The ceiling and roof would have been completely demolished and the halls would have been smashed through.Keep in mind folks that this is the point of view of someone who's only seen New York through one form of media or the other, so if there's anything anyone wants to add to the list of errors, than just submit them to my account.In all fairness, I still find this to be a good attempt at story telling. I hold to my rating of 8/10 for writing and production, but only a 2/10 for continuity.",Godzilla

HUGE! I should have waited for all the negative reviews to come pouring in. Ferris Bueller is in this movie, but that doesn't save it. Hank Azaria can't save it! The special effects couldn't save it. Jean Reno didn't even need to be in it! The monster looks faker than the old-school ""man-in-suit"" version. Somewhere in the middle of this movie it turns into Jurrasic Park in Madison Square Garden. Now MSG does not have the greatest rep. I mean the Rangers suck so bad they haven't made the playoffs in 7 seasons! But still... No need to disgrace the place with this garbage! Poo on a stick. I would criticize the plot but there was no plot. Big monster comes to NYC and thrashes it. What is with this new trend in movies where NYC get trashed? Why not Memphis or Atlanta? Why is it always MY beloved city? Think about it. All those meteor movies, disaster movies, etc. Its always the Empire State building falling or Grand Central burning up. Enough!

The movie consistently delivers such intended laughs and never takes itself seriously. All of the characters melded well, and it's puzzling that Maria Pitillo's performance should have been considered sub-par. To this viewer, she was convincing and engaging. And so what if the movie lacks the ""spirit"" of Godzilla? It also lacks the ludicrous special effects of the Japanese versions.",Godzilla

330,Ramalama_FFF,"Unrealistic and dumb, but not quite as bad as they say",6,20 March 2011,"For its category, Godzilla is a decent film. But it does has some big problems which cannot be ignored, and those who say that critics should just take it for what it is - entertainment - and not have high standards for that matter, are wrong. Not having expectations of great artistic merit doesn't mean you can treat the story any way you want without some criticism.The general clichés I think most people will accept, but well, Broderick as some nerdy guy amidst the chaos is afterall a minus, as it's just a bit ridiculous and not funny as they seem to have intended, and his whole romantic story with his old ex hurts the story more than it helps.But I guess the main problem was the unrealisticness parts. As in such a huge monster just coming out of the water in Manhattan like that without anyone noticing before he's actually there.Or the scene where the guys in the tunnel don't realize he's there despite the animal moving its eyelid just a few meters away and even making noise and moving.For me most of all it was the part of the film where the baby godzillas go after the humans. That they would start act like vicious velociraptors five minutes after birth is too ridiculous. You may call this a detail, but it is a key element in the plot. I know these are lizards who don't need the long 'learning curve' like mammals when it comes to hunting for food but Jesus, this was just over the top. They'd have to run out of fish long before they'd start behaving like that, and even then they'd be pretty lame at it at first.On the plus side though, there are a lot of cool scenes and you get plenty of good shots on Godzilla. And it being a huge blockbuster, I don't know what people expected if the disappointment is as huge as it is. I've seen a lot of films in the category that are worse. But Godzilla has somehow been talked of as one of the absolute worst big action flicks of all time, which I don't really get. It's certainly watchable, but it could have been a LOT better. Those who pretend like it's as good as it gets need to think of Jurassic Park.",Godzilla

I have only seen this part in the trailer, and it´s sorry that it couldn´t be in the movie as well. A large plus for Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno for excellent acting.

338,innersmiff,Why it's called Godzilla:,4,14 October 2009,"$$$$$$People tend to hate this film for its premise rather than it's film-making qualities. If it was called something else however, it would not have made half as much money. The film itself is poor, a definite thumbs down. No drama, no suspense, no thrills. For a monster film it kind of falls flat on it's face.It's real crime is that it's called Godzilla. The creature itself has so many differences to the original that it's not right to call it that (Gojira was over 400 feet tall and would tower over the world trade centre). So it's not the actual creature, let alone a remake (it has nothing to do with the plot of the original film either). Just plain fail from Emmerich and co. So the only possible reason for calling it Godzilla must have been to cash in on the name. Thanks but no thanks.",Godzilla
339,filmsbythefire,Not as bad as they say!,6,29 November 2008,"First off, I just want to say that I know this film is nothing like the original Godzilla (although I actually haven't seen any of those), and I respect that some people won't like it for that. But I feel myself that even if it's failed as a remake, it's certainly a thrilling movie in its own right. The opening was really haunting; the music and the nuclear montage really reeled me in, and the attacks on the boats were amazing (especially the state the big fishing boat ended up in). When Godzilla gets to New York, things just get better from there - the effects are good, and the cast play their characters well (yes, even Maria Pitillo). I only have a few small criticisms; 1. Even without knowing the true Godzilla very well, this one is clearly a total Hollywood farce - an iguana on steroids, that has a massive chin and looks completely different than it did before the nuclear thing (it was supposed to simply grow, but its like its been to the gym too) 2. That taxi in the chase must've been indestructible. I swear, it wasn't a regular vehicle... the suspension was incredible, surviving being almost swallowed and trodden on and thrown about,and then the high-beams... and the JUMP off the collapsing bridge onto the road! 3. Speaking of that bridge, it must've been made of reinforced diamond - it sort of half-heartedly collapsed even after a dirty great anthropomorphic lizard jumped on it. 4. In real life, I doubt four people would escape a hell-hole like that with just a gun and some chandeliers...Despite these flaws (which I think added a bit of comedy) I think it is a much underrated film that deserves a bit of slack. Maybe just give it a second chance, hm?",Godzilla

What surprises me is that it scored lower than Godzilla 2014: 2014 godzilla was atrocious, boring, lacking a plot, lousy acting, cheap effects that is hidden y dark tone, don't see Godzilla until the end and was VERY underwhelming...
Godzilla 1998 is the exact opposite: looks more realistic, more fun, decent plot, good comedy relief, fantastic action: we don't immediately see all of Godzilla, but it doesn't wait until the best end of the movie to show us Godzilla either! So what it takes place in the USA and so what the design isn't like the original and so what this Godzillas origin is an iguana mutated by Nuclear Radiation: all in all, I'll watch it many more times throughout my life...

342,dhreid,Not Godzilla,6,7 July 2006,"First of all, this is not a Godzilla movie. It does fairly well as a monster movie except for the god awful choice of Maria Pitillo as the lead actress. She makes dumb blonds seem like Einstein. There are plenty of really smart blonds out there but Pitillo is just plain embarrassing. The computer graphics are outstanding. I would have rather seen someone like Peter Weller as Dr. Tatopoulos. Why they kept making a joke out of his name is beyond me and the total disrespect shown him is uncalled for. This man is a scientist of some esteem. How he ever had Pitillo as a romantic interest with his genius and her crass stupidity is a true mismatch. Jean Reno is very good as he is, in my opinion, all of his roles. Vicki Lewis, who I think is sexy as hell, as Dr. Elsie Chapman, also did well in her role considering the script. Hank Aaria as 'Animal' and Arabella Field, another cutie, did quit well with their parts. Kevin Dunn as Colonel Hicks was a disgrace to our officer corps. When Broderick corrected Hicks' mispronunciaton of his name, Tatopouolos, Hicks answered with a 'whatever',,,disgusting! What's the story with Sergeant O'Neil? He is not funny, just plain sickening. He is as dumb as a brick and a disgrace to every non-com in our military. The opening scene with the fishing vessel in natural and 'unnatural' distress is impressive. I was nine years old when the original 'Godzilla' was released and it scared the bejeesus out of me. I now have fifteen follow-up 'Godzilla' films in my collection and love each one. These are tongue-in-cheek matinée gems. I am a physician and when I want to escape from reality, and 'Godzilla' movies are a real escape from reality, I pop one in the VCR/DVD player.For crying out load, one has to understand that this new version is still a reality escape but with tons of acting flaws with weak scripting which I can love in B films like 'The Monster that Challenged the World' but are inexcusable in a costly film like the one under discussion. With all of the actors and actresses out there that would probably jump at chance to play(and have fun)in a really good write of this film, I can see why they did not jump. If they had a really good screenplay script and the actors were anywhere near believable this could have been a really good film. They missed a real opportunity here, an opportunity wasted,,a chance to introduce 'Gozilla' to an entirely new generation of kids and adults that are kids at heart,,not to mention the opportunity for at least one sequel. Where was the Morgan Freeman narration, Will Smith's excitement or even Elvira's campiness.Sad. When I left the opening day showing at the local cineplex, I was almost in tears.

Harry Shearer? Hank Azaria? More suited to light comedy fare. Not a disaster movie. Which ended up making this a disaster of a movie. And what was with all the rain? I felt drenched after watching this. I hope that someone somewhere decides to update godzilla, and do it the way it should have been done this time.

I did not like most of the rest of it. I definitely did not like the star-crossed-lovers bit (Niko and Audrey's reunion). I did like the Mayor and his assistant, particularly the bit about ""no sweets before the election"".It did remind me somewhat of Evolution (David Duchovny, Julianne Moore), which I liked very much - that was also silly, but done much better.I was quite happy with the CGI, although my date thought it was cr*p.

I'm not sure why it's rated so low, it's easily one of the best science fiction action movies of the 90s after big ones like Jurassic Park 1 and 2 and Independence Day. Those kind of movies might've had better acting but watching this movie, it doesn't even make sense to need an Oscar worthy performance.
The effects were good for the time. I feel like people bash CGI like they're some experts on movie technology.
To make a long story short, watch this movie if you're into fun action movies and not the ones that are usually top rated because one actor or actress was convincing while being filmed in a beautiful location.
This movie is far from boring, even a little funny at times, the acting is absolutely fine and the plot is fine too. I wouldn't really look for small details that make no sense in a movie about a giant radioactive lizard. The 2014 reboot was boring for like 3/4 of the movie and the King of Monsters sequel was a lot better but still not as exciting as the 1998 version.

Also, for most of the film, you only see Godzilla's foot.  A more suitable name for this abysmal production would be ""Godzilla:  Foot to be Feared!"".

Oh wait, the guy that replaced Keanu Reeves in Speed II was the most miscast actor of all time, but these two people come a close second.  The lady just can't act.  She can't.  Brodderick can act, but in this film, his acting is...Laughable to say the least.  This film also rips off other films.  Let's see now.  When the discover the eggs in Madison Square garden, Devlin and Emmerich (The producers) rip off alien. When the four characters are being chased around in a cab, the film rips off Jurassic Park.  When Godzilla jumps into the water, before you can say ""Brain Dead Production"", it rips off The Hunt for Red October.  I read a review and the reviewer said ""The only rip off I was waiting to see next, was of Devlin's or Emmerich's head"".  Whoever wrote that is a genius.  I couldn't agree more. This film is just putrid.  Horrible.  Whenever the lead female came on screen, I felt like vomiting all over the screen and protecting everyone from her...Well, crap acting.  I hope Devlin and Emmerich never make a film again...Honestly, do they think we will just eat anything they dish out?",Godzilla
359,gniandra,but seriously....,1,6 November 1998,"Ok, for those who have NOT seen it: Freak lizard is created because of radioactive leakage on its tropical island. It grows up and heads to New York and terrorizes the place. Uh oh, it lays eggs (it's a-sexual!) in madison square garden. Submarines chase Godzilla down in the East river (or wherever it was) and blast it with missiles. It dies but we're not sure. Then eggs hatch (200 of them) with Ferris, his pretty ex-fiancée, Hank Azaria, and french hero guy in the Garden. But godzillies get blown up without Ferris and everyone else dying. Ferris kisses the girl. But soft, Godzilla lives, and he's pissed. But Ferris and friends out-race it and lure it to the Brooklyn bridge. It gets blasted with missiles on the bridge when it gets tangled in the support wires. It dies, heroic cheers ensue, the end...But soft! A baby godzilla egg survived the blast! Part 2 look out!Now you don't need to watch it. Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.ok, now for the comment: this flick annoyed the hell out of me. Here's why:-about half-an-hour is wasted to show people with wide eyes and dropped jaws, frozen stiff every time they see the thing. I realize people probably would indeed be frozen with fear, but for the movie and our sake, RUN! We don't need to see them stare every single time.-it took an hour before we saw the damn thing's face.-for God's sake, helicopters can fly vertically.-cliche, cliche, cliche. It's only an action/fantasy movie, but for crap's sake, they could have used different methods in presenting this movie to us. eg, different lines, camera angles, methods of keeping us in suspense. I was rolling my eyes in the first minute of the movie.-basically, it's been done before, only Speilberg actually presented a movie with newer methods of suspense, and too many films after it have ripped him off, this one was the last straw.I actually yelled in the middle of the movie, out of anger, because I was so ****ed off. Every line, every scene, every camera angle, every character, was played. The effects are fine but they were done 4 years ago. I have a feeling that this movie was meant to be a cult classic. You know, bad but yet people love it. Well, I hated it. After careful consideration, I've determined that it's my most hated film. Well, at least it affected me. Movies are supposed to do that.",Godzilla
360,moviefanatic3000,okay,5,20 December 1999,"this movie wasn't that bad.

The sound is also pretty awesome, it's a great demo movie to test your sound equipment. The pace/speed in this movie is good, overall it's just a light hearted action movie and one of the better ones! I really don't understand why you can call this a bad movie, probably because you don't like this kind of movies? Go watch something else!! Go buy this one!

This ain't Shakespeare, folks, but it's entertaining nevertheless. It's a crazy, campy, rampage through New York, where the ""good guys"" do almost as much damage as the real hero of the flick, Godzilla himself. The dialog is over the top, but often witty, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. Matthew Broderick turns in an entertaining performance as the nerdy anti-hero, aided by the enigmatic ""insurance guy"" played by Jean Reno, and an assortment of variously goofy lesser characters.Don't expect a great plot, but if you give it a chance you might just be entertained.",Godzilla

Sex and The City decided to make a Sci-fi because it would be ""fun and easy."" That was my take on it. My next topic would be who really pocketed the cash because this was obviously about pocketing. Science fiction fans like me want it to have a good story as well as special effects and the suspension of disbelief. The impossible is possible so that everything comes together and is real for 2 or three hours so that sitting in a cramped, stale theater armpit to armpit with fat bastard, chair kicker and the kids isn't a disappointing waste of time. For some families getting out to a theater is expensive after concession not to mention standing in line with disrespectful and rude bullies. Truthfully it was made for TV.",Godzilla

So this movie is not so great, and in the wake of Jurassic Park, etc., it sometimes seems like ""been there, done that"" but it really is a fun-filled romp of a monster movie on it's own. I personally don't miss those Japanese guys in their rubber monster suits one bit. Give them credit for trying to entertain the rest of us who have matured beyond the traditional Japanese versions of this story. I liked the humor, the characters, the babe, Matthew Broderick, the use of FX, the insults to American tastes in coffee by the French agent, the old fisherman on the pier, and lots of other scenes.

366,motherfu,A huge-budget remake of the cheesy overseas monster movies.,10,20 September 1998,"Godzilla had the Lost World Curse. It was so anticipated, that it could never have been the movie we were hoping for. Remember the previews, one entire year early, at Men in Black? The commercials at midnight on New Years Eve? The ""Size Does Matter"" billboards that appeared anywhere and everywhere when Summer 98 approached?  What kind of movie could possibly live up to that hype? The backlash was pretty bad. Just as soon as the movie opened, there were people who were dying to see it, just so they could say 'guess what? Godzilla sucked!' Well, guess what? Godzilla didn't really suck. It wasn't the summer's biggest or best, just like Hollywood hoped, but it was still a decent monster movie. Godzilla wrecked New York City, and that's exactly what I paid my money to see, so I was pretty happy. It seems silly to include a love story, and yes, we do get Matthew Broderick as a scientist trying to re-hook-up with his ex-girlfriend, virtually the same time as he's trying to stop Godzilla. But it never slows the movie down, there's still plenty of Godzilla smashing buildings and stepping on cars and swatting helicopters. It's a good thing Devlin and Emmerich left all that stuff in. The movie ends with a shameless opening for Godzilla 2, although now there's talk of cancelling the sequel because the backlash was so loud. Well, I hope Sony does go ahead with it, because there's definitely room for improvement.",Godzilla

368,Byers,Plot does matter.,1,18 April 1999,"This movie proves several things: there is no sure thing in life, many very stupid people work in Hollywood, and plot does matter.  ""Godzilla"" was supposed to be the monster hit of 1998, overwhelming audiences with its hype and special effects.  But when word got around, it's no surprise that it was quickly forgotten (or at the very least, people TRIED to forget it).  The story is a carbon copy of thousands of past movies, the characters are one dimensional cardboard cut outs, the dialogue is completly ludicrous, and the special effects aren't very special.  There are only two, slightly original elements of this story: Godzilla shows up in NYC, and it's pregnant. Neither of these is enough to carrying this overblown movie though, especially the NYC angle, which is spoiled because it appears they shot this movie during the monsoon season.  Avoid this one if at all possible and rent the original instead; at least its camp is somewhat entertaining, while the remake just disappoints.",Godzilla

No but pretty close.  I would recommend everybody to see this movie.",Godzilla

The SFX alone are miles ahead of the best Japanese Godzilla movie ever made.  The hugeness of the monster in this film is awesome as well.  Overall, watching this film was a very fun experience, and I'd watch it again!",Godzilla
372,ciarandino,"An enjoyable movie, but as had been said a billion times before, it's not Godzilla",2,9 October 2012,"This is a highly enjoyable movie, with some good scenes in it, and I have a lot of nostalgia for this movie as well. However, I do of course have some gripes. The biggest one is the huge lack of Godzilla in this film. You'd think that a film called Godzilla might actually feature, ya know, Godzilla, but instead we get a completely different monster that we're expected to think of as Godzilla. Now don't get me wrong, GINO (Godzilla In Name Only, as pretty much every G fan knows) is an awesome monster. He's very well designed, and pretty damn cool. But really, the movie should have been called something else, because calling it Godzilla is false advertising. Heck, the director, Roland Emmerich, didn't even like Godzilla movies very much, making one wonder what on earth made him want to direct one (money). But in spite of all this, this is still a highly enjoyable monster movie.Now the thing that I like the most in this movie are the scenes with the monster. They're all very enjoyable. First is the scene where GINO attacks a Japanese fishing ship. It's very effective when the monster shows up on the sonar and everyone is freaking out, and then the awesome pause where we hear that ominous groan the creature makes before all hell breaks loose and its claws break straight through the ship. Next of course is when GINO shows up in NYC, with a brilliant shot to reveal him rising from the sea, and a subsequent scene which shows as little as possible of the monster as it rampages through the city streets. Of course there are also the scenes where GINO goes up against the military, which are all enjoyable scenes.Now for the things that annoy me, apart from the movie not actually featuring Godzilla. For one thing, the characters. They are all 2 dimensional idiots. The only likable one is the french guy, who's name I cannot recall. Next is the fact that they set up the monster as a sympathetic creature, and yet expects us to celebrate when it dies. It spoils a kind of sad moment when it dies, and there's silence, and suddenly everyone bursts into applause. And of course, there are the baby Godzilla's. They kind of felt like an unnecessary addition to the story, pretty much just filler. So over all, I think it's an enjoyable movie with some great moments, but of course, it does have a good number of flaws, and calling it Godzilla was just milking the name, because it was really its own thing. Anyway, that's all I have to say on the matter. Ta ta",Godzilla
373,starlet86,it's the characterization stupid! it's everything!,5,22 July 2001,"I taped this off TV and I found that it wasn't that terrible.  But it is bad overall.  Especially since my sister erased the good parts.  Alright, I'll get to the point.  I found Phillipe, the mayor and Animal were quite funny. Devlin did a pretty good job with the humor and the supporting characters. The action and humor were a huge improvement from the boring Independence Day.  But he didn't develop the main characters, Nick and Audrey very well, and that brought down the movie.  They were very wimpy.  Most of the dialogue involving the love story was cheesy.  Nick and Audrey have their moments (when he sings Singing In the Rain is hilarious, how she talks about why Caiman is dirt was written inteligently) but are the overall terrible products of shoddy character development.  Main characters are the big guys of the stories they're in. So they carry the stories.  And when they're not developed well, the story doesn't hold up.  Nick and Audrey brought the movie to a catastrophic crash (and a big, huge, loud thud).  Godzilla has a lot of cliches but it wouldn't have mattered if the characterization was done right.",Godzilla

On the other hand, parts of it were hilarious(and yes, the little intelligent dialogue that was there), and it's exciting when they're in the Garden.  And the supporting characters, especially Animal, the mayor and Phillipe were good.  So I'll give it a 5/10 since it's so hard to judge.",Godzilla
375,Kakarot_XR,Jean Reno. Godzilla. New York. Amazing. SEVERELY UNDER-RATED.,9,29 August 2008,"Yes you heard me. I said this movie is SEVERELY UNDER-RATED. Why? I don't know. Maybe the Japanese couldn't stand to see a Hollywood Godzilla and all of them came on IMDb and gave it a 1 (after all, it does have 5, 000 1's!) which is completely ABSURD as a lot of the Godzilla movie's by the Japanese that I have seen have literally SUCKED. S-U-C-K-E-D.MechaGodzilla fights Godzilla? Why can't they just shoot the thing with Missiles. Godzille fights an alien monster? WoW. Godzilla returns all were linear and had pathetic acting and choreography.Now Hollywood decides to make its own Godzilla. Okay, Hollywood are known to take good things and turn them into bad things - like what they are going to do with REC and what they did with Vanilla Sky (sure it was still a great film, but if you watch the original you might change your mind). But seriously, Hollywood SUCCEEDED THIS TIME! Godzilla did offer a good start and a good end. Sure the film is rather unrealistic, but it is - entertaining and fun to watch. The storyline is good, the cast of characters in my opinion was perfect - Jean Reno as hard man was good. Only thing I didn't like was how they didn't exactly explain where his character was from. But I guess that adds to the excitement of the story as it does make the viewer interested from the start about Jean's past.Overall Godzilla is a solid action movie with the occasional joke. Any monster, action, thriller and horror fan would thoroughly enjoy this movie.Don't listen to the no obs who hate this movie thinking it's a carbon copy rip off. It isn't. And it deserves a much better score than 4.7.",Godzilla

I mean really! Just look how ridiculous this version of Godzilla is compared to the real thing. What the hell was Roland Emmerich thinking? Doesn't he follow any of the Godzilla movies at all? This giant mutated iguana or Godzilla wanna be does not compare with the real big G at all! At times like this, I'm just glad that I don't work for Hollywood movie companies. If we wanted a new Godzilla movie I rather have him look like him, Not a poor imitation of him! I can tell that this movie will be long forgotten. These movie makers try too hard! To say the least. That's it! dinosaur movies are doomed to extinction! Period. Watch Independence Day instead. It's a much better Sci-Fi flick. Godzilla 1998 is a complete insult to Harryhausen's monster hit, Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Godzilla 1998 is the worst thing to happen to an icon since New Coke! This film should have been called ""Iguana, When Nature Calls"". I think the toys that Trendmasters made from this film look a lot better than the monster itself in the movie! Believe me!! This movie makes Juassic Park 3 look like a hit!",Godzilla
377,tristenjones-74208,"If this wasn't considered a ""Godzilla"" film, I'd forgive it",4,1 August 2018,"Now, coming from a lifelong Godzilla fan, this film still kind of shocks me. Now when I first watched this film, and saw Zilla for the first time, I thought that Godzilla would show up later and would fight the monster. However toward the end of the film when I found out that was actually supposed to be Godzilla. I was in complete shock. I had no words. For one, the monster looks nothing like him, and his personality was nothing like Godzilla's. Godzilla's common personality was to go through and destroy everything in sight, this one, it just walks through New York not destroying anything. I mean, most of the destruction came from the military. And most damage Godzilla, sorry ZILLA created, was toward the end when he was going to die. Also, don't even get me started on the baby Zilla's. They look like the Velociraptors from Jurassic Park, and although the scenes don't look half bad, it's just to more of an Alien/Mutated version of the Jurassic Park raptors scene.Although you try to not focus on humans in Godzilla movies, the humans are just unbearable in the film. Being the most bland characters you can see in a movie. The only character that's actually interesting is Jean Reno. Matthew Broderick and Maria Pitillo just want to make you fall asleep. While the others can be viewed as just completely annoying.Now this movie wasn't all bad, I was definitely entertained by it in some scenes, however I just don't see it as a Godzilla film, because it really isn't. Even calling it Zilla is being nice, because I can't see it being remotely near Godzilla. I mean you don't see a movie of a Barbie Doll coming to life and then call it ""Childs Play."" No, this movie isn't bad, but it's not a Godzilla film in my mind. 4/10 stars below average.",Godzilla
378,Keyser-15,Two and half hours of my life gone,3,2 August 1998,"So many things wrong with this movie it's difficult to know where to start. First off, and the most glaring problem, was Maria Pitillo. In a movie populated by talentless actors, one-dimensional stereotypes, and cliche after corny cliche, Pitillo managed to suck what little life accidentally found its way into the movie with her airhead blitherings. Next, onto the real star, the lizard. It was one of the least frightening things I've ever seen, and nothing more than a stripped down version of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park. The only device in the movie that appeared to take more than ten minutes to come up with, Godzilla the creature was one big yawn. Nothing in this movie was original in the least.

I don't know why before the movie they didn't just have a little monologue from the director taunting ""You're all stupid for coming to see this!"". That's the way I felt when I left the theater. Now, aside from the fact I didn't know whether or not we were supposed to feel sorry for the Godzilla, or whether it was supposed to be scary and evil; I found it to be rather....shameful. I feel as if Hollywood thinks that if there is cool special effects and lots of explosions, it won't matter that the whole story line stinks like last weeks trash on a hot July afternoon.",Godzilla

385,Mathewdixon42,You had to grow up with it,6,2 May 2016,"Is this movie bad? I suppose so...I still love it! And nothing will ever change that. Godzilla was created by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the same team behind Independence Day. There is no better way to describe what this film turned out to be. It's Independence Day with a giant Iguana, instead of aliens. As a lifelong Godzilla fan, I do have to agree that this is Godzilla in name only. But how does it stand on it's own merits. The tone and direction is exactly the same as Emmerich's other films. Fun action, amazing special effects, cardboard characters, wooden performances, and cliché filled scripts. Matthew Broderick is amusing to watch in the film, he seems to be trying to do the ""awkward nerd"" routine, but it just comes off as rather awkward in general. Jean Reno is fantastic. I maintain that there is no movie this man could not save. He does all he can with this performance, giving us mystery, a commanding presence, and some of the films genuinely funny moments. The design of Godzilla (or Zilla as he is now known) is very strange. At the time this was somewhat of a disappointment after all of the marketing. We we're expecting Godilla, and we got a ugly looking Iguana. They really, truly did take the ""God"" out of Godzilla here. The effects are cool though, even for a nineties movie. So why do I love this movie? It's a fun movie, and it doesn't need to be anything more then that. The 2014 Godzilla and Pacific Rim became the new standard for American monster films, but this one came long before, it failed. But it's still fun...Granted I was 7 years old, that could be a factor I suppose. Is the movie good? Nope, not really. Would it work for a modern audience? I doubt it. Did 7 year old's in the late nineties like it? Good god I hope so!If you found this review rather boring, you most likely would not like the film.",Godzilla

It has decent CGI for the time and nice action sequences and that, to me anyway, made it entertaining enough to sit through it...again...and again...and again.I've basically watched this dozens of times since I was a kid and I'm 22 now.Although I do agree, this American Godzilla is totally different to Japanese Godzilla and so I just call it Zilla like most fans.",Godzilla
387,K-Mac017,What a (bastardized) piece of cinematic crud,4,14 July 2006,"Well, let's seeTHE GOOD: -The fact that it was based in New York City (good choice of locations, in other words; it might not be THAT big of an accomplishment but it's a start for this movie at least) -The visuals, for the MOST part, I thought were good (particularly when the army fires all of those missiles/machine guns at 'Zilla) -The story, not the monster involved with it but the story ITSELF is still in the spirit of the original movie(s)' (he develops/oversizes in the EXACT same way as the original Godzilla)THE BAD: -The acting sucked -'Zilla received hardly any on-screen time (which is actually more or less a good thing, if you think about it)-The ""remade"" Godzilla was toned WAY down from the original to the point that it was just too weak to be taken seriously as a giant movie monster (ie: dying from just a few missiles, bleeding from machine gun fire, etc) -The fact that 'Zilla ran more than it destroyed (and that the army actually caused more destruction than it, like somebody else said) -The ""redone"" Godzilla's complete lack of intelligence (running into and getting stuck between the bridge cables, chasing a taxi cab around town and underneath a tunnel instead of just stepping on it or blowing it over with it's air wave breathe)So all in all not a very good movie. Granted there are much worse out there but this I would actually rank lower than most game-based adaptions (and pretty much on par with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation). This is such an embarrassment to the original that they actually went as far as (WARNING: Spoilers for Godzilla: Final Wars if you haven't already seen it)Having this bastardized American Godzilla get killed off by the far superior original, King of the Monsters Godzilla in Godzilla: Final Wars. Serves the guys who made this movie right, they deserve it for literally crapping on such a popular FOREIGN-marketed franchise. In the near future I'm hoping for another remake, one that's at LEAST in the spirit of the original, not one featuring a big monster that's completely opposite of everything that made the original Godzilla great: intelligent, mean-spirited, violent, and highly destructive.

388,SevenStitches,"Okay, so i liked it, kill me!",6,17 April 2007,"Roland Emmerich's Godzilla remake is an old enough film now to have a solid consensus on its quality laid upon it. Common knowledge would say that it was a very bad film. And yes, technically speaking it's not the best by any means. The plot's like swiss cheese, acting on most fronts is perfunctory, which compliments the script's quality nicely (if unintentionally) and the whole thing borrows and cannibalises many, many monster/sci-fi genre conventions. And you know what, ever since i first saw it on the big screen, i still enjoy it. Maybe that's because i was so young at the time that i couldn't care less about the finer qualities of cinema (i was, and still am to a limit, a self proclaimed monster movie nut) and have seen it so many times from then onto the present that i haven't had time to mature to its faults in between viewings. I'm not saying its a great movie by any extent. In fact there are moments where I admit it is very poor. But it does enough things right to stay afloat.Staying pretty close to the fundamental concept of the original Japanese ""Gojira"", ""Godzilla"" is all about a phenomenally massive, radioactively mutated reptile, causing mayhem and destruction to the nearest mass populated metropolis. It's up to the local scientists and militia to find out where this thing came from, why its here and how to stop it. That's not the most concise version of the plot, but it's not too bad either. Lets elaborate on the new stuff.Changes have been made to Americanize the story, two of which are obvious; the lizard wasn't a result of the Horoshima fallout but of French Pacific Island nuclear testing; the city under siege is Manhattan, not Tokyo. Attempts at modernising the tale for a contemporary, more environmentally conscious audience have resulted in turning the monster into a fish eating, asexual, egg laying creature just trying to find a suitable nesting site, thus he (why is it called a he if it's pregnant?) isn't just destroying stuff because it's a nifty past time. The person who finds this out is a biologist Nick Tatopolis (Matthew Broderick), who's dragged out from his study of Trenoble earthworms to deal with this slightly bigger specimen. Him, along with the US Army led by Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn), track the beast from early sightings and boat attacks on nearby island chains up to the big apple itself. They aren't alone. A French secret service group led by Philippe Roache (Jean Reno) is on the same trail to clean up the mess his nation indirectly caused. On top of all this we have Nick's college sweetie Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) in the city pursuing a news reporter career, with help from cameraman Victor 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria) and his wife Lucy (Arabelle Field), with a chauvinistic anchorman Charles Caiman (Harry Shearer) getting in the way. (You can choose to ignore the last plot strand if you wish)So that's Godzilla without the big 'plot twists' that take place at various points, but will no doubt be anticipated by any conscious individual watching. The main story and characterisations have never been the monster/action/disaster flick genre's main attraction and that's no more true than it is here. All the players are caricatures and genre stereotypes and any attempts at depth (Nick and Audrey get back together after a long hiatus) are dealt with very poorly, but thankfully its not enough to sink the whole ship. Its left to the actors to carry all the scenes that don't feature the titular monster (too few) and most of them do the best they can with a script that does nobody any favours. Shearer, Azaria and of course Reno have good comic moments and seem to take the script as the preferable but unintentional tongue in cheek variety, Reno especially, hamming it up as the dude who knows the score and goes through the whole ordeal with a knowing confidence and swagger. No one else makes an impression. Broderick is adequate for the lead but nothing more. Pitillo, despite looking gorgeous, comes off kind of annoying as the love interest, playing it in semi-dumb blond mode (still, that girl is hot!).The movie is successful in two areas, the first been Emmerich's once again not very subtle but still amusing political satire on America, from their gun ho culture in neutralising threats, the scathing media, to the mispronunciation of Gojira that becomes Godzilla. Genre movies are also parodied (although that could be kind talk for outright plagiarism) from the likes of Dino DeLaurenti's ""King Kong"" to ""Jurassic Park"" (featured in a horrendous chapter containing Baby Godzillas), plus the Mayor of New York, Mayor Ebert, is a caricature of the real movie critic Roger Ebert.The monster itself is the second and most noteworthy success. A concoction of both the original Godzilla and modern day reptilian design, it's a marvel to look at. Yes, the fact that it's a CGI creation is unmistakable, but it transcends the dated technology with a soulful performance, present mostly due to the way it's animated, with a lot of naturalistic detail in its behaviour, instilling feelings of intimidation, awe and endearment (its phenomenal size adds to the intimidation factor). The action scenes are directed and choreographed with Emmerich's nack for large scale destruction and special effects, and both are therefore top draw. There are some stand out sequences, the most memorable been when Godzilla first takes a stroll through Manhattan which is both awe inspiring and exciting.Godzilla is no masterpiece, not even a good film in some areas and as far as remakes go it doesn't rank highly. But it's an enjoyable piece of fluff that overcomes its glaring faults by been occasionally funny (sometimes unintentionally), satirical and containing a handful of well orchestrated action sequences featuring one of the best movie monsters in recent film history.",Godzilla

And Godzilla doesn't shoot ""energy rays"" from his mouth...lol...whatever that is. Spielberg, take note, that pathetic city sequence with the T-Rex was lame. Make it longer and make it look good. I've seen this film over and over and over. Slow motion, freeze frame, etc and I have yet to be surprised. I feel the weight and mass of this creature as he/it wrecks destruction upon the city and am glad that his ridged back doesn't shimmy like some old woman's forearm every time he turns his head. But, hey, you should appreciate that...",Godzilla

You've seen the low budget Japaneese original. You know the drill. You got what you expected! I enjoyed this movie. I didn't expect much in the way of plot and dialog, and I wasn't disappointed. I agree that the acting could have been much better. I agree the plot could have been better. And, yes, the casting didn't work. I just kept seeing Ferris Buhler!

It was slow in spots and the acting stunk, granted, but I defy anyone to say they were bored from the time our heroes entered Madison Square Garden until the end of the picture.",Godzilla
392,Krud,"Despite their catch phrase, size didn't matter all that much.",1,11 July 1999,"There are a number of things I could gripe about regarding this movie, but it's not worth my time.  However, the biggest complain I have against this overblown remake is this: there is no sense of proportion.Anyone with the slightest amount of observation skill will notice that throughout the movie, Godzilla seems to grow and shrink, depending on what the situation calls for.  One moment he's frolicking in a subway tunnel, the next he's obliterating a skyscraper.  It's as if they couldn't decide whether they were going for a T-Rex look or... well, Godzilla.I'd say more, but I've already given the movie more attention than I'd care to.(The scariest part of the movie? It leaves room for a sequel...)",Godzilla
393,joey526,Only worth watching on TV for free,5,3 June 1999,Going into the movie I expected it to be sooo bad from all the critics bashing it..that is turned out to be not to bad. I didn't pay to watch it so I can't say it was a waste of money. The special effects were pretty good. A few parts seemed like they were taken from other movies. The babies chasing our heros around the arena....Jurassic Park. And yes I would have to agree with an earlier comment I read about the hatching eggs....Aliens rip off.If you are not paying to watch this film and do not expect to much out of it than you may even enjoy this movie. Otherwise I would recommend waiting until the movie makes it to TV.,Godzilla

395,fctyger22,A pathetic excuse of CGI,2,20 January 2015,"I grew up on the classic Godzilla movies from Toho Co., Ltd. when they were broadcasted on television networks. My all time favorite was ""Godzilla on Monster Island"" aka ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"". The music, the fights, all the acting was top notch for the times. Fast forward to 1998, I got no problem saying that I only bought the video release of this movie just so I could claim to have every Godzilla movie ever made; but I don't watch it. No guy in a lizard suit, no atomic fire breath, and the King of all monsters spends more time underground than a groundhog. Oh he does have an interesting roar, and a somewhat acceptable entrance at the fish market, but I wouldn't place ""Zilla"" in the same primordial food chain as the real King of all kaiju.",Godzilla
396,julesrulesny,no justice..,9,18 March 2012,"14 years now after this movie originally came out - First of all, wow time flies I can't believe its been that long.. Anyways, the critics ruined this movie for so many people. After watching it again for the first time in years now in 2012 I fell in love with this movie all over again as I loved it when it first came out.. This movie is a tried and true blockbuster film. It really does have everything - I mean, what else can you expect for an over sized lizard taking on Manhattan? I actually enjoyed it so much I watched it again this weekend.. I just had nothing else to do, and started watching it and couldn't stop for the second time. Yea there were many clichés, comical story arcs and some story arcs not needed.. But, all in all the writing was tight, didn't leave anything feeling forced and a very enjoyable movie to watch. I almost wish this movie was coming out this summer and gives me something to look forward to, in going to the theater on a hot summer day.. Again, I still can't believe its been 14 years as I still can remember the advertising for this movie, the Mc'd cups, and ""special meals"", the posters, etc. Anyways, since its been so long and I now have become a huge fan of this movie, I just wanted to give it some proper justice! A great movie.",Godzilla
397,theinvisiblemonkey,Better than what wanna be critics said it was,10,3 August 2003,"Anybody who criticizes this movie as horrible, or ridiculous.. is themselves ridiculous.  What could you expect from a movie about a huge walking lizard that is bigger than buildings?  Why on earth would you walk into the movie thinking you were going to get reality?  I cant get over my frustration with morons who constantly criticize fantasy/fiction films.  GODZILLA offered exactly what all the hype said it would offer.  It was a big bang action flick with a huge walking lizard.  Expect ""Gone With The Wind"" you are just an idiot.  I suspect most of the people who criticized this film really liked it, but are too jealous of somebody elses cool idea and success that they have to cut them down.  Either that or they are trying to hard to be a film critic.. which is just a worthless job so why be one?",Godzilla
398,stashyjon,A complete waste of celluloid,1,9 July 2006,"Oh dear. There are some films that probably seemed like a good idea at the time but with the cold hard light of hindsight shouldn't have ever been made. The complete waste of time is a case in point. Forget all the camp action of the classic Toho Godzilla cycle; there is no thinly veiled post Hirosima nuclear paranoia here, no guys in rubber monster suits jumping on plastic kit tanks and swatting 1:72 scale jet fighters off wires. Instead we are faced with some impressive but sadly predictable set piece action sequences, Matthew Boderick with a sickening romantic sub plot, Jean Reno on auto pilot saving the day and Jeff Goldblum rehashing his role from Independence Day and not really giving a damn. In fact this film IS Independence Day but with a large lizard replacing the evil aliens. And yes, just like every other Robert Emmerich film, the good guys win. They zap Big G with the aid of a couple of subs and the Brooklyn Bridge, blitz Godzilla's nest (of course leaving an opening for a sequel) and go home for a slice of 'Moms Apple Pie'. This film not only lacks the camp humour of the Toho originals, but also misses the point of the doomsday monster as mankind's indestructible nemeses, alway there to return to make humanity pay for his crimes against nature. Inshort avoid like the plague.",Godzilla
399,luxmansell,Mediocre,5,25 February 2019,Best bit about this film is puff daddy's remix of a Led Zeppelin classic. What a complete train wreck with some modest CGI for its time. Acting was very poor to average,Godzilla
400,Amblin,Size Doesn't Matter anymore.,5,7 April 1999,"I had my own hopes and aspirations for this movie, and some of them were fulfilled, but the majority were just crushed in Godzilla's wake. After viewing yet another screw-up by Emmerich and Devlin, I decided to work out how MY Godzilla movie would look.....and MAN did it kick their's! Firstly, cut the duration down to about 115-120 mins (there were heaps of insignificant parts to cut out), give Godzilla a more destructive flair (audiences want to see him/her beating up buildings) and it would've looked good after Emmerich and Devlin's experiences with destruction in ID4, make Godzilla a more terrifying sight (i was more scared of a 20ft T-Rex in JP than of a 300ft lizard!)....making the audience scared is what brings in the dollars, and come up with a more creative story (if u look at the credits u will see that it took 4 people to come up with that poor story! disgrace!). The acting in this movie is below disgraceful, as u can clearly see that the director is not from an English-speaking country.....the actors sound like foreigners trying to speak English and use our expressions. Even though the monster itself was quite a spectacle, the makers didn't harness the full potential of it to create a terrifying film. Terror is the way to go.",Godzilla
401,Rick-245,Fun flick in the tradition of Jurassic Park,7,22 November 1999,"This movie is not nearly as bad as a lot of the reviews below would have you believe. Worst movie ever made? Hardly. Worse than the old Japanese versions? Not in my opinion. I found it only slightly less entertaining than ""The Lost World- Jurassic Park"", but for the most part it has the same chills as that movie and there's a couple of scenes that would be too intense for children under 12. I thought the special effects were pretty good- not great, though. As far as Matthew Broderick's acting, I think he did as much as he could with the script he had to work with, or maybe comedy is more his style (i.e. ""Ferris Bueller""). But, here again, I didn't feel his lack of charisma in this role was enough to detract from the film. One other point about this flick I haven't seen mentioned was that Jean Reno's performance was quite good. So, I would recommend this film to rent without hesitation if you're a fan of the Jurassic Park films. It's really not a bad film, although not exactly a classic. I can imagine seeing it on the big screen would do it a lot more justice.",Godzilla
402,orcrush,where's Tom Servo when you need him?,1,22 August 1999,"I know that adding a comment to the lot of 235 for this movie is probably as fruitful as pouring table salt into the Atlantic Ocean, but when a picture is this revolting it could use all the pans it can get. I saw it the day before it was released at a free sneak preview, and I still felt I needed my money back. I know plot and dialogue aren't terribly important for a 'summer blockbuster'(hey I enjoyed Independence Day for what it was), but anybody could have written and filmed this tripe if they had the resources. It seems if you hype something up long enough, people feel compelled to see it. And to top it off, Maria Pitillo and Hank Azaria(who was terrific in The Birdcage) give what have to be the worst performances I've seen. The saddest thing about it is that a few weeks after watching it, I saw a British Godzilla go through the Mystery Science treatment, and it was a much better film.",Godzilla
403,curl-6,Absolutely terrible,1,24 June 2006,"Yes, I'm a die-hard fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies, but that's not the only reason I hate this film. Like many fans, my biggest problem is that the American 'Godzilla' is that it's nothing but a CGI lizard with NONE of the character, personality, symbolism, or even sheer power that made it's Japanese cousin so indescribably cool.However, forgetting this, even when I view this film as a run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster, I can honestly say it's among the worst I've ever seen. So what's wrong with it? Where do I start? Annoying, unlikeable characters, (Particularly the downright hateable Audrey, who I got the impression we're supposed to LIKE [!?]) flat, uninspired acting, a unimaginative and ridiculous script, (Yes, I know some of the Japanese films suffer from this too, but they were at least fun to watch) sloppy direction, a stifling lack of originality, and sheer bad taste combine to make this the cinematic equivalent of nails on a blackboard.Even the super-high-budget special effects aren't too impressive; while the Japanese films used their $11 million budgets to create awesome scenes of pyrotechnic destruction, this film's $120 million budget seems entirely devoted to endless shots of a giant iguana running through city streets. The LACK of satisfying destruction is hugely disappointing; to put things in perspective, imagine what the Japanese filmmakers (Especially Shusuke Kaneko) could do with a budget of $120 million. Wait a moment while I wipe the drool off my keyboard.Basically, this is a downright terrible movie, and not just from the perspective of disappointed fans. If you want more proof, check out the 'Awards' section for this film; it won Razzie awards for Worst Remake/Sequel, and Worst supporting actress (Maria Pitillo/Audrey) and was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Director. All I can say is that it should have won the last two.",Godzilla

This is trash! Bleh!"" And they may be right. But...Why would that even matter?Godzilla 1998 is not a great movie, that is true. But when it comes to pure entertainment, it holds up pretty damn well. It's got action. A bit of comedy. Romance. Okay, maybe not romance, but it's got a ton of action. I mean, it's kinda fun seeing ""Godzilla"" (i'm putting quotes here because people like to argue whether the monster here can be considered a Godzilla or not) rampage through the city. Maybe it's just me.If you play this movie expecting to see something on the lines of The Shawshank Redemption, you'll be pretty disappointed. But if you want 2 nonstop hours of exhilarating monster-movie action, then Godzilla 1998 is the movie for you!(or you can just watch the 2014 one, that's good too...)",Godzilla

This one was made 5 years after Jurassic Park and didn't show an improvement technically, but neither that nor faithfulness to some 60s rubber suited actor effort is what bothers me. And sometimes nostalgia actually makes you forgive and forget. I actually thought it would, and was surprise it didn't.My problem is that it's so shallow and dull. All of its flaws, technically or otherwise, would have faded if it would allow anyone to be sucked in. But instead, it reminded me of my experience in theaters - basically turning me from fan to non-fan of Reno and Broderick. That takes some effort. I can't think of anyone in the cast that I liked at all. That's pretty bad, and it's the director's fault.If you ever wanted to see a story that you can predict from the disc cover to the end scene and want to hate everyone in it and be bored by boring scenes, boring lines and boring screenplay while you're at it, this is the one.It is terrible.

411,Transient-Orca,The American Godzilla,8,15 April 2007,"I saw this movie when I was 7 years old. And I loved it. I just absolutely loved this movie.Now I am 15 years old, and I still very much love it. I am tired of hearing people say how horrible it is, and that it didn't follow the original Godzilla. To tell you the truth, I hated the originals. Even when I was 7 years old, I hated the originals.I don't like the original Godzilla. Mainly because he is shown as an evil monster that destroys buildings on purpose, and is just out to kill everyone. He was a basic mindless monster that could breath fire and was just huge. Too me, that is not entertainment. Really I thought it was kind of lame. On top of that, the story was too far fetched, what with huge moth-things and other movie monsters, that really are just kind of weird. Don't get me wrong, the originals will always have a place in amercian and Japanese pop culture, but really I didn't get it.I like the new ""American"" Godzilla, because he seems just a tad-bit more real. Meaning that he was a victim of human carelessness, and he became a new species of animal, just trying to survive like all other creatures on earth. But he was too big in a world too small. He seemed almost kind of gentle and curious, but he was just too big for humans to coexist with him, just him finding food was enough to destroy half of New York.Really I think it should be OK, for someone to make a different ""kind' of Godzilla. I like the Godzilla who was more of a victim, than a mindless monster.",Godzilla
412,edgy,Surprisingly Good,8,18 December 1998,"I like this film. Broderick is one of my fave actors and he is charming here. Jean Reno is excellent.  Maria Patillo does a nice job; she makes me like a character written as whiny and manipulative. Most female movie roles are saints or witches. This falls in the middle and I think audiences were thrown by this independent, yet insecure late bloomer of a girlfriend.    As For Godzilla, he was awesome. I like his physical appearance and his very fast footwork running around the skyscrapers. He showed some intelligence during these chases. This is great because the original Toho Godzilla was dumb as a rock in all those old movies. The special effects are truly wonderful. I like the recruitment of the ""worm guy"" and his scientific expertise, as played by Broderick, seemed real. The Mayor Ebert character was overdone. He was deliberately annoying, but even New Yorkers wouldn't tolerate that level of buffoonishness. When all the baby Godzillas start to chase our heroes, this is too reminiscent of Jurassic Park. On the other hand, when Broderick and Reno first discover how many eggs there are,and they begin hatching in front of them, this is truly terrifying.  It's one of the best sequences in the film. I consider this film to be very underrated. There are three interesting characters, great F/X and action scenes and some humorous moments from Hank Azaria.  I had a really good time watching this movie.  I give it eight out of ten stars.",Godzilla
413,edgy,Surprisingly Good,8,25 December 1998,"Unlike Armageddon, the other heavily hyped film of '98, this film is actually watchable. In fact,  I enjoyed it! Matthew Broderick is delightful as the ""worm guy"" with his typical understated charm. His scientific expertise seemed genuine. Jean Reno is appealing as the French ""undercover"" agent. Hank Azaria is funny in all his scenes.  Maria Pitillo plays a woman who once dumped her lovable boyfriend so, as written, this is not a sympathetic character.  She learns to take the initiative and have confidence in herself, but only after betraying the trust of Broderick one more time.   This is a coming of age story for a woman. It was interesting to see in a genre film such as this.Godzilla himself is very impressive, running through the skyscraper corridors, breathing fire and looking very realistic. I'm glad he was given a sense of intelligence, especially in the scenes with the chopper pilots. The nesting sequences are very well done. Inspired by Aliens/Jurassic Park, the hatching and subsequent flight from the reptiles is truly exciting and well staged. Excellent use of CGI!There were a couple of minor distractions. Mayor Ebert was idiotic and obnoxious. Standing (not running) while watching the pavement split open between one's feet was certainly silly. All in all, a good time at the movies. It's written in the spirit of the original Godzilla movies, with plenty of humor and a coming of age story. I was impressed. I'd be happy to see a sequel. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.",Godzilla
414,Milo Jerome,Godzilla is so far from being quarter-decent that my sense of wonder was finally only inspired by the ineptitude of its makers.,2,23 January 1999,"Surely the spectacle of a movie like 'Godzilla' is its raison d'etre? Even if it's unevenly cast, badly scored and overlong you should leave the cinema with its set pieces etched into your brain. 'Godzilla' is so far from being even a quarter-decent B-movie that my sense of wonder was finally only inspired by the ineptitude of its makers. For anyone who thinks that making a brainless, fun, monster movie with a big budget is easy, look how badly it can all go wrong! I felt as if I were watching a first,lazy, REALLY lazy cut with all the flab and the extraneous dialogue and needless subplots and cutaways left intact. The effects are nowhere near good enough to stand up to close scrutiny: (check out the scenes of Godzilla v. submarine and see if there is ANY sense of scale conveyed whatsoever.) The pacing is the worst I have ever seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie, and I've seen plenty of ropey movies in my time. But beyond all of this, the greatest sense of the movie I was left with was one of sadness and sympathy for the tragically brilliant Hank Azaria who acts as if he thinks he's in a movie 700% better than the one he's actually appearing in, for Maria Pitillo and her thankless wet lettuce role, unfairly savaged half to death in most of the reviews I read at the time of release, and Jean Reno for bringing his brand of dignity to a film that in no way deserved it.",Godzilla

416,Magnum-9,What a bore. What a shame. BURN THE ANSWER PRINT!,1,25 July 1999,"This is one of the only films bad enough to make wanna leave halfway through.  I mean, I was so bored, so disappointed, that I was squirming in my seat.  This horrible waste of time, talent (whoops!  did I say TALENT?), and money completely convinces me of how bad and commercialized films have gotten in the 90's.  Does a film really have to have a multi-million dollar budget, nonstop action, and a no-brainer plot to make money nowadays?  I'm just downright sick of it.  I usually stick to the lower budget pictures in order to make sure I keep my brain cells, but even those have gone to pot in our cynical society.  So just ask yourself one question:  how the hell did this film get made?Easy answer.  You see, according to today's Hollywood standards, all you need is a bankable icon, such as a star or a franchise, and people will allegedly pack the theaters in herds.  I see it happen again and again. Stupid, dumb, idiotic moron movies like this one are making swarms of cash, while the little-known better pictures are being dubbed as ""boring"".  Well, let me tell ya, THIS IS BORING.  And totally stupid to boot.  Like the dreaded ""Independence Day"", another one of my pet peeves, this film has a script more contrived and pathetic than a five year old could write.  Where are the brains in these characters?  How stupid can one character possibly be?  And how stereotyped as well?  The writers must have just rushed into the schtick of the Godzilla character and forgot about a story.  All these idiots care about is making their shots look ""cool"" and seeing how much money they can blow on moronic special effects that were, in my opinion, frankly not that good.  I could care less about how neat they can make Godzilla look.  Who cares?   I'm frankly getting sick of stupid computer special effects, because, unless they are used to move the story along, they're worthless and sometimes look ten times worse than just using conventional stock motion animation (look how they ruined ""King Kong"").  If I had it my way, you wouldn't even see the friggin effect.  You'd have to imagine it.  Or at least it would be good for camp.  This isn't even worthy of that status.  I mean, isn't that the only reason to watch the original Godzilla?  For camp?  To see how cheap and tacky the creature and cities look?  Not for some mega budget, computer-generated moron who looks like he doesn't even have a face.  Kinda reminds me of the bugs in ""Starship Troopers"" and how they were so uninteresting and lacked any personality or facial expressions whatsover.  At least with stock motion animation you get some sort of emotions.But stock motion is too outdated, now isn't it.  And so is talent.  Roland Emmerich and that Dean Devlin character are the two biggest airhead sell-outs in film, and Hollywood whores to boot.  Why are they still employed?  Simple.  Because they had a big hit with ""ID4"" and now they're cash cows, a perfect necessity to Hollywood.  Frankly, I think that if I had that huge budget, I could make fifty little films, each twenty times better than ""Godzilla"", each more entertaining, and each would probably pay the bills.  And I don't need all the sugar-coated Hollywood hype either.  Word of mouth spreads fast.So give me one reason to even waste my time explaining the plot.  A big dumb creature stomps on a big dumb city.  Whoopie.  And he stomps on big dumb people while he's at it, the only redeeming quality to this tripe.  Sounds sorta like the catch to ""Independence Day"", huh.  You can either sit back and take in how stupid the plot and characters are, and how horrible the actors are (in a mega movie.  hmmmmm.), or you can go to sleep.  For some reason I saw this crap in the theatres.  Human nature I guess.Number one on my All Time Worst Movies List.  {zero} outta **** stars on my personal scale (Before this garbage, it never even went to ""zero"").",Godzilla

I think that it's a great action movie, and right in line with the classic Godzilla movies of old.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should the viewer.

Godzilla then makes landfall and wreaks havoc on the streets of the Big Apple. They set traps too try to kill Godzilla, but to no prevail. The main character than gets a blood sample and found out that ""he's pregnant"", and that he came to New York too nest. I won't say anything else.

But, that's also kind of what happened in the original Godzilla too, so it stays true in that way I guess :)I love monster movies, whether played serious or cheesy but I still think they're awesome, AND as a monster movie I think this succeeds. I just think because it was a American remake of the classic Japanese monster it's for that reason it failed. If it was made to be an original monster with no connection to Godzilla AND named something else entirely I think this would've been received better. I suppose since it wasn't and was made for the purpose of being a remake that it just came across as disrespectful to Godzilla fans. Personally I never took it that way. As a monster movie, it holds up. >(GODZILLA)< is why it failed - in my opinion. Some people complain about the special effects and I agree in some moments, especially the baby Zillas, it doesn't look too good BUT this was 1998 and for that time I'm sure this was taken as having amazing effects in league with Jurassic Park. Some people don't like the look but Roland Emmerich wanted to make it look different than the Japanese version (guy in rubber suit), so of course it wasn't going to be similar. I like the look and yes he looks skinnier and not as strong but they made it faster and more agile than the original Godzilla. I don't want to talk much about the story - only that it has a good monster movie story (characters not so much), but we're watching this movie for Godzilla, not the 'humans'.My whole point is, IGNORE the haters and if you've never seen it and like these types of movies give it a chance.",Godzilla

This 'movie', in fact called ""Jurassic Park 3-Spielberg-is-too-expensive-let's-try-emmerich"", is the most disgusting movie I ever saw in my whole life! There is NO Godzilla to be seen in the whole movie, thus I cannot imagine the title of the film...Mr Emmerich must have read the wrong script... Well, I admit that some of the sound FX were really good, but this doesn't make a film. I waited for nearly two hours to see any Godzilla - but none did appear. The visual effects can be seen in all earlier Emmerich films combined with Titanic. Nothing new. Just boring. OK, now some facts: if you compare Emmerich's budget (about 120 million U$?) to the cost of ALL JAPANESE GOJIRA-FILMS TOGETHER, you will see, that it is less than his. But each of the original films is indescribably better than this DINO-movie... I don't like it a bit. And, as true Godzilla fan (I've seen nearly all of the films more than once), I hope that Toho Inc. will never again give the film rights away to Hollywood or anywhere else than Japan.But the worst message was that there could be some more movies done by Emmerich dealing with Godzilla.

While this new one falls short of deserving such revere, I do believe all the negative reviews are uncalled for.  True, some of the casting left a lot to be desired (Pitillo and Broderick come to mind).  But this Godzilla movie does something that NONE of the classic one did.  It shows Godzilla as a creature, not a monster bent on creating havoc.  As with all creature-features it's only natural to root for the decline of humanity at the claws of nature's creation.  But here we're shown two creatures, humans and Godzilla, how are striving to survive.  Humans attack Godzilla because he's (or she's) destroying our homes and businesses. Godzilla only attacks out of self defense, and later out of revenge over the death of its young. Aside from the National Geographic aspects, the special effects deserve an Oscar nomination, if not Oscar himself.  Godzilla looked and behaved in a believable manner.  Not since Jurassic Park has this occurred. One final note, for a 'pitiful, weak story' GODZILLA is in the top-five take of 1998's summer grosses.  Roland and Dean, if you do a sequel as planned, really reconsider casting.",Godzilla

This is an all out action movie that deserves way better reviews than it got. This movie could have been horrible, but the characters were pretty well fleshed for a movie of this type, and the makers actually went for the pathos angle with the creature. Rather than make Godzilla a giant monster, they gave the creature a personality with its behaviour, a personality that can best be seen at the Madison Square Garden explosion.

Hell, I didn't even go see this movie at the theater.

Instead of Godzilla destroying an entire army, we have this big iguana running in terror from a few friggin' helicopters! Instead of an indestructible terror, this big iguana is killed by a few measly helicopters. This ripoff from Jurassic Park does less damage to New York City than the armed forces do! Oh, and lets not forget about the baby iguana-zillas, a blatant ripoff of the Jurassic Park raptors.My rating for this movie is 0.5 out of 10. What a horrible movie!

434,thepolyblog,Too bad some of the budget wasn't spent on plot or acting,6,5 December 2019,"Plot
A large reptile mutated by French nuclear tests in the Polynesian Islands goes on vacation in NYC.What I Liked
Matthew Broderick (playing Nick Tatopoulos) adds another genre to his list of acting credits (following War Games, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Biloxi Blues, etc.) and takes on the role of the disrespected scientist who knows all about radiation effects on all creatures great and small because he has been studying mutated worms in Chernobyl. The special effects are pretty good (covering underground, undersea, heart of NYC, etc.), and there is something somewhat more menacing about this big dumb creature than the smaller but far more intelligent raptors from Jurassic Park. And the scene at the start where three fishing trawlers are destroyed is far more interesting than anything seen during the sinking of James Cameron's Titanic (with the possible exception of the propeller guy). Although this movie is not an actor's dream, Matthew Broderick does a good job and seems more comfortable in front of the camera than usual. Jean Reno (playing outside ""investigator"" Philippe Roche) is the best of the supporting actors and he steals a couple of really good scenes. Hank Azaria (of sitcom fame like Herman's Head) is surprisingly good as cameraman Animal.What I Didn't Like
The sub-storyline is Nick's reunion with his college sweetheart Audrey Timmonds (played by Maria Pitillo) -- an aspiring reporter who left him after college to tackle New York and who really wants this story as her big break. Standard fluff for the movie and no real sparks between the two of them -- more like old friends running into each other on the street. Pitillo is poor generally, with some really bad lines and some really terrible scenes where she's trying (but failing) to act upset. Other times you almost even care what happens to her -- almost, but not quite. One downside to the special effects is common in many movies of this type...most of the action takes place at night -- in fact, there is not one single shot of the creature in good light and the efforts to stop him are hampered by the fact that it rains the entire ""week"".",Godzilla
435,ncleasure,"You know what, it was just a good monster movie.",8,10 January 2019,"In typical fashion, whenever rotten tomatoes tanks a movie, it is almost like engraving future cult classics. Yes the acting can be a little cheddar, or is it monetary? Yes the CGI is showing its age. And yes Emmerich is a little to, um, Emmerich at times. I think that at one point the following conversation happened.""Mr. Emmerich, I finished the chase scene, what do you think?""""Not bad, needs more helicopters though."" Adds more""Okay, how about now?""""More!"" Doubles the helicopters""What about that?""""Damnit son, we have CGI budget for days, go nuts. I have to go to lunch.""
Take out helicopters and put in almost every other prop in the film. They do go to town on everything. However from a cinematic standpoint it does work, it is not the bloated comical monster vs uglier monster. It is giant radioactive lizard vs the US army who apply their universal creative and nuanced approach. It is just a good romp though NYC watching a Godzilla smash the place up and as humanity struggles to react to the threat. Now I do have some legitimate problems with the film. Despite being cold-blooded, the missiles launched at it were mostly SALH or Semi-Active-Laser-Homing or MWRH Millimeter-Wave-Radar-Homing (also apaches don't have side mounted cannons but if it makes the star wars nerds cream their jeans, eh worth it). I don't speak French so some subtitles would have been nice. The nest scene was a rip-off of Jurassic Park. Mathew Broderick was not used to his fullest potential. Some of the characters, like the camera-man guy, could have been cut completely and the film would not have suffered. Godzilla didn't have enough screen time and the creature itself looked more like a frog crossed with a T-rex than Godzilla. Flaws aside, this is still a hundred times better than those stupid man-in-a-monster suit cheese-fests from the 50's and 60's were Godzilla can blow himself around the set and it looks like all the props came from the dollar store.

444,Aitch-5,"Good FX, but the characters are annoying",4,15 July 2000,"I just saw Godzilla on cable, and I think I have a few ideas as to why it bombed in the theaters.1) Why is it that whenever a character stands face to face with Godzilla, his reaction is invariably to keep standing there and stare at it as it approaches? A cameraman runs out into the street soon after Godzilla shows up in New York and STANDS THERE as Godzilla's foot crushes a taxi cab parked right in front of him. The strangely unmasculine hero of the picture with the Greek last name nobody can pronounce, along with the Frenchmen, just STAND THERE in the bowels of Madison Square Garden as Godzilla's eggs start hatching all around them. Having characters standing there in the middle of imminent danger does not build suspense; it makes the characters look stupid.2) The hero of this picture is - well, somewhat less of a hero than we usually expect to find in an action picture. Let's face it, Matthew Broderick is not an action star. He actually looks a little ungainly in the shots showing him running from the Godzilla hatchlings. Imagine Bruce Willis in the role and you'll have an idea of what kind of excitement is missing here. Nevertheless, the movie has Broderick spending the final third of the film running around. And unfortunately, he isn't running around trying to be proactive, setting up traps and thinking on his feet (if he were, that all by itself would have made this movie much more enjoyable). No, instead he spends lots of screen time being chased and calling on the military for help. You might ask, ""This guy is Mr. Everyman. What else could this guy do?"" -- to which I would reply, ""Why have as the hero of what is supposed to be a high- octane action picture a guy who can't do very much about the problem that the movie presents, other than calling in the military?""3) Various inconsistencies. Other posters have listed a few of them, but the one that really annoyed me was the difference between the initial dogfight with Godzilla and the scenes in which our ""heroes"" are fleeing Godzilla in a taxi cab. How is it that Apache helicopters have a hard time keeping up with Godzilla, but the taxi cab (surely a much slower vehicle) manages for long minutes at a time always to stay inches ahead of Godzilla? Has Godzilla gotten tired by that point in the movie? After the helicopter-attack sequence, the fleeing-taxi-cab sequence feels like a cheat to keep the suspense going. So my answer to the people here who genuinely liked this movie and keep pointing out that the movie is supposed to be a roller-coaster ride, not ""Shakespeare in Love,"" is that the movie doesn't quite work even as a roller-coaster ride -- for reasons that include those I've just listed.",Godzilla

But when I saw this I was terrified out of my crap. Godzilla's huge size was the most horrific sight. I could of course understand the story since I was young & was only fond of the movie because there was the huge beast. But when saw it 7 years later in Hindi version, I completely enjoyed it. I also understood the whole story. It was marvelous. The things I liked: 1.The sinking of the fishing ship. 2.Dr. Nick singing the song:""I'm singing in the rain"" 3.""It's Tattopolus"" 4.Godzilla's first appearance. 5.Dr. Nick standing on the footprint. 6.The climax where Philip(Mr. French) drove boldly & Dr. Nick gave a nice shock in the beast's mouth. 7.O'neil's action. Roland Emmerich should be given credit for making the film a must watch. I now have DVD of the movie. I had read the subtitles from which told the quotes in no.2 & 3. Movie people, please watch the film, It's great.",Godzilla
452,I_solved_Rubikscube_in_one_min,5.2 rating? seriously???,8,12 August 2013,"This is absurd! This was one hell of a movie and it doesn't deserve anything less than 7 stars.I remember watching this film as a kid on a VCR. I loved it very much even then. Ever since its been on TV several times but now I finally got a DVD and saw it all over again. It still is amazing! First of all this was one of the better films of Roland Emmerich. I've seen most of his other ridiculous films like 2012 and The Day after Tomorrow. Compared to those, this one's a masterpiece. I've seen the Japanese versions of Godzilla films as well and Apart from GvsKG(1991), I didn't like the other films in the series. This American version of the monster just made more sense, as a dinosaur and as a member of Reptilia, than a toy-model of an clueless and purposeless (like it was born only to destroy Japan), erect-standing, fire-breathing, frog-leaping (Yes Godzilla leaps like a frog in some films) sorry excuse for a dinosaur. Having seen a lot of Japanese films under world-cinema, I must say their films are very good but I'm sorry to say that I find their Godzilla films just pathetic. Its like watching Super human samurai on Nickelodeon. This one, on the other hand, was an edge of the seat thriller film for all those sci-fi geeks like me and by now most of you might have seen it may be tens of times but this is me glorifying this film to those who haven't seen it. There is a 2014 version of Godzilla in the making. Hope its even better than this one. I can't wait to see that next year. Well, what do you know, time flies!",Godzilla
453,camtcox,Okay... but it's not the Godzilla I grew up with,6,4 September 2019,"I have nothing against the movie. The action and special effects are pretty good for 1998. Some of the acting is ok. My main problems are some of the choice of actors (two of them are veteran voice actors from The Simpsons), the change of origin to Godzilla, and his redesign. However, despite its flaws, it's still somewhat enjoyable.",Godzilla
454,cdunn1974,A great monster movie!,9,16 February 2019,"A very cool movie with great effects, lots of action and a little bit of comedy and romance thrown in. A popcorn flick worth checking out just for the effects. I grew up watching Godzilla movies when I was a kid and I loved them, but now when I see them they're dull and boring until the last 20 minutes. This movie is entertaining and very exciting and is a lot of fun. Yes, Godzilla is different in this movie and it does have its flaws, but I loved it just as much as I did the old Godzilla movies. There is something fun and magical about this film and even if the critics hate it, it's still more entertaining than the newer Godzilla movie is. Godzilla will always be one of my favorite movie characters and I really think this movie helped bring him home to the big screen. Either way we're gonna need a bigger box!",Godzilla

And: are we sure theydid spend more than 100M $ to craft this below average piece of moviemaking? SFX were crappy, acting poor (and no Big Buck names were involved), and the entire Madison Square Garden Velociraptor-like sequence stinks. Furthermore, there'stoo much advertising and in-Jokes like major Ebert (thumbs down!) are silly beyond forgiveness. American audiences should be angry with Emmerich. He's a heavy teutonic iconoclast revanchist: it seems he only gets pleasure out of destroying the country. At one point I thought the Army was going to defeat Godzilla with another 1,000 H-Bombs like they did in ID4! can you imagine the sequel?

If you didnt like, thats fine; join the crowd.  If you did, alright, good for you.  I thought that it wasnt a bad film, although it did rip-off 'Jurassic Park' in many scenes ('JP' is my fav movie).

The plot is so thin that it shouldn't even be mentioned. It almost seems like the whole point of this movie was to do some kind of we-can-do-jurassic-park-too technological masturbation. I just don't get it. This movie has already (even with same english title) been done some dozens of times in Japan (and Jurassic Park II wasn't too far from it either), so why bother?

How could a gigantic monster just disappear while being monitored by thousands of soldiers?  I know it's science fiction but they could have done a better job.,Godzilla
461,rothtein,Very disappointing,3,24 December 1998,"Talk about unoriginal.  How many movies did these guys steal from?  Godzilla was somewhere between the velociraptors from Jurassic Park and the creature from Alien.  Not to mention at least one shot which was taken directly from Jurassic Park.  You'd think when making a movie about a gigantic dragon you'd be able to come up with a few ideas of your own.  The movie's not the slightest bit scary.  Not terribly exciting.  Devoid of suspense, like just about any action film.  Some cheap humor, but not much.  And oh yeah, doesn't Godzilla breathe fire?  Not this time around apparently.  Not worth the rental.",Godzilla

You might even say they had gone ""akimbo.""Anyway, I do regard Godzilla as the ultimate example of story and characters shamefully subjugated to money-making devices, such as explosions, big shiny weapons, and giant piles of fish.  To all those that mock the likes of me for ""expecting Shakespeare,"" I say this: clearly I was not expecting high art.  The title alone should suggest, even to the most unsophisticated moviegoer, that one is in for two and a half hours of lizard warfare.  Most of the time, I enjoy movies like that, escapist movies, simply because I find it fun to get caught up in the action.  But isn't it a bad sign when, in the case of movies like Godzilla, you CAN'T get caught up in the action, because you are completely distracted by the flaws in the plot, the endless lifting of material from other films, the truly despicable ""heroes"" and the fact that the monster is BORING?!As if that weren't enough -- this is where the film jumps from ""bad"" to ""indefensible"" -- does everyone remember Mayor Ebert and his little nerd sidekick Gene?  Well, that stupid act of bitter self-conscious critic-bashing is a good example of just how childish as filmmakers can behave.  Siskel and Ebert gave a negative review to ""Independence Day,"" so that bit was a little act of passive-aggressive revenge on the part of the filmmakers.  By virtue of that act alone, the makers of this film have hereby been disqualified from the ""artist"" category forever.

463,Jerald,Godzilla?,5,27 December 2000,"Warning: The following may contain spoilers. Read no further if you don't want any detailed information about this movie.
Being the Godzilla fan that I am, I was both excited and skeptical about the ""new"" Godzilla. Excited because there would be more ""Godzilla "" for me to see. Skeptical because I didn't know if they could pull it off.Did They? Let's see...My whole life Godzilla has been a man in a suit. While, throughout the years this suit has changed (almost every single film used a different suit), Godzilla still looked generally the same. I knew going into the film that there was a new look, and was pretty open minded to that. I also knew that he was to be computer generated (CGI), which I was anxious to see. Upon seeing Godzilla in the film, I was very pleased with the look of the creature, but felt that maybe this film should have been called something else. I don't know what, but just not Godzilla. Well, I guess they knew that if they had made a film with it's own identity, they would have been taking a greater risk. We all know it's not about risk, it's about money. Would I have been as excited about a film called ""Iguanasaur""? Probably not.The Godzilla effect looked good and the creatures introduction was very good. The audience gets to see the creature a little at a time while he has an exciting romp through town. That, however, is about the best of it.
The acting? Bad. Every time Mathew Broderick opens his mouth he sounds like an 8 year old boy. The other actors are not much better, except for Jean Reno, who does an ok job. However, if you saw him in The Professional, he looks like a caricature of himself here.As far as the other effects go, I could have done without several scenes. They can suspend my disbelief enough to make a ""giant dinosaur thing"" seem real, but then try to tell me that a fisherman is going to get his line tangled in something that looks like it's more than 200 yards away? Dock scene: Cut it!  Helicopters flying very quickly between buildings? Cut it! Bad CGI helicopter flight paths? (one of my pet peeves) Cut it! And that horrible ""drive out of the mouth"" scene! Cut that too!The part of the movie I liked least is the velociraptor- uh, I mean baby Godzilla submovie. They spent way too much time on this and it really detracts from the ""Big Creature"" feel of the movie. Even so, keep your eyes peeled for the baby Godzilla with the big bag of popcorn in it's mouth, it's really funny. Baby Godzilla submovie: Cut it!Well, if we were to cut the scenes from the movie that detracted from it, we would have little left but the trailers for the film, which were excellent.Did they pull it off? No. Did it make money? Yes.All in all, it's the Halloween III of Godzilla movies! (Halloween III had no relation to any other Halloween film)",Godzilla
464,frances59,Classic Media Vs. Godzilla fans,10,16 September 2009,"Without a doubt, Classic Media has done a great job presenting Godzilla the way he should be on DVD. They've previously released 5 of the big guy's flicks with both American and original Japanese edits in their widescreen glory along with some decent bonus material. The problem is two Godzilla films are currently only available in this set. It's been reported on a few posting boards that they will be released early in 2008. Good news for those of us who have been rabidly buying each title as they've been released, but it would have nice if they were put out at the same time as this set.

469,Nikolaevna_Romanov,Zilla,1,25 August 2006,"Roland Emmerich and the studio company used Godzilla's name merely for marketing business. In other words, earn more money.The creature shown in this movie is not Godzilla, nor is it a monster. He is merely a giant mutated lizard looking for a place to live in, which is in New York. He has no weapons/powers of any kind, only a flame blast from it's mouth, which was used only twice in this movie and did little damage. He is extremely afraid of the military, running away every time they pursue him and attacking them only when they're in small numbers.One thing I didn't like about this movie is the fact that France was to blame for the mutant lizard's creation, instead of the United States, who is the actual culprit (In reality they tested nuclear weapons in the Bikini Islands). Not even actors Jean Reno and Doug Savant could save this piece of crap, who were the only ones making a good performance.As a matter of fact, nothing in this movie impressed me. Emmerich portraying certain characters after people in real life he hated is extremely childish and immature (He named Mayor Ebert after critic Roger Ebert, who gave negative reviews for movies Emmerich directed). Grow up, man.Sure enough, he is killed, and like every other monster movie which has failed, an heir always appears in the end. True Godzilla fans must avoid this movie and stick to the Japanese version. That's not Godzilla, it's merely a giant lizard.",Godzilla
470,intuitiveinks,"Not bad, but the flaws get in the way.",5,30 August 2020,"There's a lot of potential and good things. Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno are great actors. I love the design of Godzilla despite the CGI of the time. And there is a moment that's meant to awe inspire that is successful. It's the scene where Matthew Broderick has a disposable camera and is standing face to face with Godzilla. Despite all the good things, there are a lot of things about the movie that annoy me. The story is difficult to follow at the beginning. The plot has good elements but they feel all jumbled and vague. The lines in the movie are very bland and cliche. There seems to be a lot of unnecessary characters, or characters that don't need to be more than what they are. For example, the red headed scientist kept flirting with Matthew Broderick when it didn't add anything to the plot. He already had another love interest and she was sad when he got kicked off of the project. Having her in the story works yet the romantic interest was unnecessary. My last complaint is that the military planes/jets/drones fly in between the buildings of New York City while chasing Godzilla. There's no way they could not fly single file while making incredibly sharp turns. Like, unrealistic things happen in unrealistic movies, but when things are meant to seem realistic, don't have planes fly in between buildings instead of flying over them.",Godzilla

I agree with the one who wrote that Godzilla is a better film than the 1998 Titanic - a by-product of very succesful marketing.An international audience (i.e. ""non-American"") is not interested if the President was informed or not and so on. I am not a Godzilla fan and maybe this is the reason why I (and all the members of my family - young and older) enjoyed the Godzilla (1998) film.I have seen the original Japanese film (many - many years ago) but the Emmerich film has nothing to do with that kind of film.(To note: I did not like the scenario and the actors in the ""Independance Day"" film by the same Director.)",Godzilla

The other actors were part of the back ground. (The actors in Independence Day were better??? Look once more that film).""not enough blood""; ""not a monster"". It was amusing to see the ""human"" side of a ""monster"". I hope next time, Godzilla 2 will give you more blood""not logical sequences""; ""impossible situations""; ""the President was not implicated""; ""Godzilla won the helicopters and avoided the soldiers"" etc No. There was no a ""superman"" Hero to save us from the ""bad"" monster.

But one day between various films we chose to see Godzilla. All four of us ENJOYED VERY MUCH THE FILM.Last week we have seen ""The Mask of Zorro"".

476,Andrew-39,Living proof that hype can kill.,6,17 August 1998,"I went into this movie with fairly low expectations, having endured a year of hype followed by 2 months of bad press.  Although it was by no means good, it was nowhere near as bad as I expected.  The flaws, though huge, should have been obvious and easy to fix : total lack of suspense buildup in the beginning, some truly awful dialogue (Matthew Broderick isn't a bad actor but anyone seeing him here for the first time would think he was retarded), Maria Pitillo, and the fact that Godzilla is cast as a victim rather than a menace.  So instead of feeling like the good guys kicked butt and killed the evil monster, you feel like the good guys weren't so good and killed a big, but essentially harmless creature.  During the best scene in the movie (the helicopter chase) I was cheering for Godzilla! Broderick's character was a problem - his feelings about Godzilla were never clear and he was far too wimpy to be the hero.  Ultimately the movie is (just) saved from being a total waste of time by star turns from Jean Reno and Hank Azaria, and by some great special effects and action set-pieces.  It did manage to hold my interest through all 140 minutes.  But with just a little more time spent on the script it could have been so much better.",Godzilla

Ironically the producers already had a pre-sold audience (Star Trek & Star Wars being other examples of pre-sold audiences). If they had simply delivered on their promise - a GODZILLA film - it could've been a slam-dunk hit. But they simply expected us to ooh and aah over technical effects *we've already seen* in lieu of plot, story & character; here's what any Godzilla fan will tell you what belongs in a Godzilla film:1. Godzilla has PERSONALITY - namely, a bad attitude and is clearly ""masculine"" - NOT ""just an animal"" as defined in this remake, and definitely NOT an egg-laying mother (!)2. Godzilla *always* battles another monster; he first emerges for a destructive temper-tantrum, then goes head-to-head with another beast intent on destroying the world; Godzilla never intends to destroy the world; he just keeps us in our place, then saves us all from something *really bad*.3. Godzilla does not get killed - ever - especially not by humans, as in this one; although in Toho's most recent GODZILLA VS DESTROYAH, Big G is self-immolated by his own radioactive heart, he will most definitely return in one form or another.You get the idea; pass on this turkey and pick up GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAH instead.",Godzilla
478,Hinin,Again...?,4,27 October 1999,The only thing really startling about this film is that they could be so predictable.  Strong strains of Jurassic Park-type ideas were used without any attempt at even a thin veil of originality.Plot twists were more reminiscent of lazy half spirals as it plummeted to earth in a hurry.

I hope you don't fall asleep, since there are about a million other reviews for this film and are bound to be either more interesting or informative than mine. But hey! My reason for writing this review is because I just can't stand all of the negative feelings toward this movie, and I feel that as a reviewer I have an obligation to help out this poor little dud.I'm not a big fan of long synopsis', so here's a short one: a lizard is mutated by French Nuclear Tests, and arrives in New York City to lay its eggs and create the new dominate species. Yep, that's pretty much all there is to it. But is it worth it in the end? To put it kindly, this film is a mixed bag, for all of the impressive effects and action and on heckuva cool Godzilla design, there is an equal amount of poor acting, strangely unfunny humor, and boring characters.I know many people who both hate and love this film for both it's faults and merits. I do not want to create a 195-page review that explores every single iota of this film, so i just want to get the message across. The fans should try and accept something different, as flawed and different as it is, newcomers should watch the movie and try to enjoy its good points and not think too much about the bad, and people who bashed it should watch it again, and just try, try, TRY to give it a chance!!!",Godzilla

From the beginning, suspense is filled and the movie leaves you yearning for more. I've hated every other Godzilla movie because I don't like their ""old"" look and they seem very tense and boring.

485,Omegamorph,Size Does Matter,10,2 May 2009,"Godzilla is the 1998 remake of the old, classic and loved 1954 Japanese masterpiece, called originally Gojira, and later transliterated as Godzilla. As the original, the basic plot is pretty simple, on the model established since The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms, the first ever film to feature an ""Atomic Monster""; this time, a nest of a non-identified Reptile (universally recognized as an Iguana, although there's little to no actual proof shown in the film) is accidentally shoved off with a nuclear bomb during the Experiments done upon the French Polynesia in 1995-1996, resulting in an embryo mutating into a 50 meters tall Dinosaur-Esquire Monster, that leads to the Big Apple.The new Godzilla is designed by the Tatopoulos Man himself, the one great man behind Monsters such as the Pitch Black Creatures, The Cave Mutants and the Werewolves from Underworld. No wonder, Tatopoulos did a really great job with his vision of Godzilla. He made a fresh, imposing design while respecting what made the original great. This take on Godzilla looks noble, somewhat like a Dragon (not in case since it was the intention), with all those spikes and rock-like textures. The Monster was brought to life through a mix of Computer Generated Effects, done by Centropolis, and practical Animatronics, created by Tatopoulos Studios in collaboration with KNB EFX. I still have a hard time telling which is which in some shots, especially with the new Blu-Ray release which is astounding. The primeval Beast was agile and graceful on screen. The Actors chosen as the cast are good ones, especially Hank Hazaria. Charismatic as usual Mr. Reno. Sympathetic Broderick. The whole film is a sharp piece of Entertainment, maybe the best delivered from Roland Emmerich. On the controversy... At a certain point of the film the protagonists discover that the creature has nested (it reproduces asexually) in no less than the Madison Square Garden. Totally a case, the eggs hatch right after they arrive. Being what they are, the newborns eat fish just like their parent, but seeing the people have walked on their food all along, they smell like fish and so the babies begin to chase them. This is sort of a reason to compare (thus downgrade) the little Godzillas to the Jurassic Park Velociraptors. Quite honestly, the only possible similarities can be found in the physical aspects, because the two creatures behave a whole bunch differently. While the former ones are intelligent strategists that rely on ambush to capture their prey, the latter ones are chaotic and stupid beings which just go after food and nothing else. But hey, those are newborns, what do we have to expect? Those ain't adults. Besides that, the original series did have representation of Young Godzillas - In particular it should be noted that Godzilla Vs. MechaGodzilla II features as well a Baby Godzilla the size of humans, exactly like in the remake. So, this is simply a new take on the Baby, what's the problem? The main issue most Godzilla fans have with this film is indeed that the creature is different than the original, that the anti-nuclear message with this Picture was practically flushed away, and that the monster dies. I see where they come from, but what has to be understood with this film is that this is a remake. Remake means remake, not sequel or reboot. Remake means re-conception, and this is exactly what this Godzilla is: a re-imagining of the Japanese Icon. Apparently different, but close in the heart. With recent visions I spotted some nice homages to the original films (particularily to The Return of Godzilla), along with other references to Alien, Jaws, Alligator, The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms and a bunch more film. The remake uses a similar choice to the 1986 The Fly, with the same basic plot as the original but with a brand new develop and execution. Both films are different from what they come from, but are still two fresh and innovating films. This is in fact the reason on which true remakes are made: have a different take on the subject and see how it turns out. Films like Quarantine (remake of REC) are useless because they bring nothing new to the Cinematography Mythos. Besides this, Godzilla died 2 times during his career, and bitching about him dying by 12 missiles that in a such smaller quantity blew up nothing less than the Madison Square Garden is pointless if you ask me. Regarding the origin, it's practically the same, and the anti-nuclear message is still here. In particular, Jean Reno signed on this film properly because it had an ecologist metaphor. The success of the film at the box-office, despite the tremendous fan backlash was a good thing for TOHO, since it produced a new film the year right after, called Godzilla 2000. It should be noted that in this film, Godzilla is much more reptilian and there are a lot of scenes that remind of the 1998 remake. This ain't a case I bet. Anyway, in Godzilla Final Wars, there appears a monster similar to the American Godzilla - called Zilla, because according to director Ryuhei Kitamura, the American remake ""Took the God out of Godzilla"" (?). This new monster however should not be confused with the American Godzilla because there are some substantial differences - it is a reference, more like a spoof, but not the same creature.I feel this movie is truly underrated. It really isn't bad - it is a classic story infused into a modern film, and because of this I feel it should be respected more. It got a lot of new fans into the franchise and made TOHO spawn yet another series of its films, not to mention the sweet Animated Series that acted as a sequel. Just see it with an open mind, and you'll enjoy it more.",Godzilla
486,ludechris31-831-223276,"My first favorite movie, actually. I was seven.",8,11 March 2018,"In between the post-Hiroshima anxiety of Gojira (1954) and the retributive-Gaia wonder of Godzilla (2014) there lies this Roland Emmerich disaster film, appropriately adapted to his action/comedy intensive priorities. Now let's talk about Zilla or GITO (Godzilla in Name Only). Creature designer Patrick Tatopolous (sound familiar?) was aware that Jan de Bont's cancelled Godzilla film had been rejected in-part because of disagreements with Toho concerning the character concepts. Tatopolous distanced his design from Toho's and De Bont's mostly out of his respect for the original Japanese monster. This distance pays off, visually. A problem I'd long had with Tsuburaya's monster was (relative realism considered) just how bottom-heavy he is. GITO is much more mobile than old Thunder-Thighs, which properly matched Emmerich's vision of a high-speed chase with a titanic reptile. Any Emmerich fan can at least appreciate the ways that this film avoids simply trying to one-up an already established cinematic mold.",Godzilla
487,bungi3215,Not a bad movie!,7,24 August 2014,"Finlly we got godzilla out of that fat looking costume! We got an actual movie instead of those childish movies. But then again. Godzilla in this movie flees the most of the time and lacks the bad ass thing. It also doesn't look bad ass when we look at the face. But the rest of the body is spectacular! It actually looks like a living creature! The godzilla in this movie is agile and intelligent which also is pretty awesome. If we added some nukes and more power and aggression to this godzilla, this would be the best godzilla film ever made. Being killed by 6 rockets was a bit of a letdown.The storyline is also a bit thin but it is something to live with. all in all, not a bad movie (Y)",Godzilla
488,CannonballJoe,Mediocre-ly OK,5,24 May 2013,"Godzilla (1998) was not great, but it wasn't terrible. I am a major G- Man fan, and this movie monster gives me and us a different perspective on the radioactive icon. Now, as a monster overall, it was decent, but as Godzilla, now that's pretty hard to accept. His trademark characteristics shown in all of the Toho movies kind of disappeared with this monster (let's just call it Zilla): its size was drastically altered and shrunk, its atomic breath was...just fire, and you really couldn't see it coming from the mouth, so it's really to tell if it is atomic (fire) breath. Oh, and also, its immunity to being killed by the army has vanished. Anyway, back to the actual movie. Like I said, it overall isn't a TERRIBLE movie. However, I feel there are some acting problems, such as line delivery. And the movie really focused on the relationship troubles of two people, and a little less on Zilla. On the brighter side, there was a good amount of action, and the computer graphics weren't too shabby. All in all, this was a mediocre-ly OK movie.",Godzilla
489,xelag,fantastic entertainment movie,10,9 February 2005,"I gave this 10/10. Why? I'm not a Godzilla fan, so I lack the background. Maybe therefore I could enjoy this movie for its own entertaining value, without having or wanting to compare it to other movies. And enjoy it I did, every single minute. The criticism I read about poor acting (Jean Reno for example: ""Jean Reno was obviously repaying a favor"" - fourque2 - I find totally based on wishful prejudice) seems to me trivial. In the given situation and genre, I think it fits in quite admirably.Of course I respect the verdict of the Godzilla fans, that's their prerogative. Mine is to enjoy.So as far as what I expected, entertainment and good effects, this rates first class for me :) My 2 eurocents.",Godzilla
490,feelingchimpy,"My Favorite ""Godzilla"" Movie!",8,29 September 2014,"This film gets a lot of hate from hardcore Gojira fans, but I was nothing less than blown away by this movie. I grew up with the Japanese Gojira movies and was very fond of the character and concept by the time this movie came out, and when I saw Godzilla (1998), I was instantly in love. The use of CGI allowed Godzilla to come to life in ways that had never been used before. I LOVED the redesign, and still do. We were presented with a creature that resembled therapod dinosaurs, a much more believable design than Gojira, who had to be designed around the ability to fit a person in a costume. The creature also arguably had more believable behavior; most animals will either flee or retaliate when attacked, and Godzilla does both, rather than walking through a barrage of military weaponry unscathed as Gojira is so infamous for. While that image does create an intimidatingly powerful monster, it never struck me as believable and I preferred Godzilla's reaction to Gojira's for that reason. While Gojira was indestructible (other than in a few Japanese films, including the first) Godzilla was not, and was killed by twelve missiles. Mutated and radioactive or not, surely a giant lizard/dinosaur has to have blood vessels and other vital bodily systems that can be damaged by such powerful weaponry, and if you take away Gojira's ability of rapid-healing, that could easily result in fatal wounds. It was a more realistic end result. I understand that judging a monster movie on realism and believability might seem ridiculous, but it all comes down to personal opinion, and I definitely prefer a sprinkling of realism in my monsters. Godzilla provided that. Monster movies are taken with a grain of salt, since they ARE monster movies, but in my personal opinion, the more realistic the monster is portrayed, the more impact the movie will have on me and the more I will like it. I like to watch movies like this and be able to think ""this probably wont happen in real life, but if it did, it would probably go something like this"" and that is exactly what happened with Godzilla (1998). Another aspect of the film that bothered people was the sub-plot with the offspring of Godzilla. I always viewed them as a way of making the situation feel more hopeless for the human characters, in place of Godzilla not being an indestructible force of nature as in Gojira films. The babies worked for me, in that respect. They finally killed Godzilla, or so they thought, only to uncover two hundred offspring hatching and ready to begin rampages of their own, and it became a race to contact the military so that they could destroy the babies before they escaped into the city, all the while having to dodge the hungry mouths of the little Godzillas. Realistically, would the human characters have escaped and completed their mission without a single baby escaping the building before it was blown up? Probably not, but that wouldn't have made for a very satisfying ending, so I can excuse that. It could also be argued that its unlikely that an egg survived the explosion, and while I was initially not happy with that result since I wasn't aware of the fact that they were setting up for a sequel that would be scrapped, it spawned my favorite childhood cartoon series, so I can excuse that too. The story of Godzilla (1998) was paced well, in my opinion, and it worked - it might have worked with some tweaks if the sub-plot with the baby Godzillas was left out, but it did work with it as well, and I don't think it brought down the quality of the movie at all. It had just the right balance of monster action and focus on human characters to keep me happy. I watch monster movies to see the monsters, and Godzilla (1998) showed enough of Godzilla to leave me satisfied, even enough to create enough of a connection to make me feel genuine emotion for the creature when it died at the end. In short, no, this is not the same Godzilla everybody had been used to. He looks different and behaves differently and is not indestructible. But don't let that deter you from giving this film a try if you haven't already; a lot of the hate honestly feels unwarranted and a little too severe, and you may find that your opinion of the film might not quite match up with the more vocal Gojira fans. In the eyes of this particular Gojira/Godzilla fan, everything just worked, and it made for an entertaining movie about a monster finding itself among civilization, people reacting to the monster, and the monster reacting to the humans' reactions towards its presence. Godzilla (1998) doesn't get the credit I believe it deserves, and outside of the vicious Gojira fans on the internet, everybody I know has loved this version of Godzilla. Give it a try, and you may not be disappointed. Even if you aren't happy with it, at least you watched the film and made up your own mind.",Godzilla

Okay giving it a one star is a little extreme, but I am i huge ""Godzilla"" fan, I focus on quality of the film from the design to the plot and even the characters personality (because no movie is good unless at least some of the characters are likable).

It's awful, no questions it's just awful with to many reasons:1. The Godzilla design's is nothing look like the original version and it make me mad that this version was a female, but TOHO themselves said that original Godzilla was a MALE and also mocking 1998 Godzilla known as Zilla.2. Idiotic characters like Dr. Niko, Audrey and even the US Army.3. It also parody and mocking at Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel as the Major and Assistant, which i find it offensive for against only critics.4. This US Army is destroys every building than Zilla.5.

494,adamkings,better than given credit,7,1 October 2016,"Okay, first off Godzilla films, the original and all the remakes, are not very good movies. generally boring, little entertainment and a bit of back story which just doesn't hold up for an hour and a half. Now, I get that the original realized the concept and is a classic; but honestly were you entertained or bored for most of the movie?This movie on the other hand ""is"" entertaining. Now, it's not a serious action movie, that's probably the reason for all the negative responses. That and the fact that it was Americanized. I guess the fans were not pleased by that. This is as much comedy as it is action. It actually makes fun of all the previous Godzilla movies and in my opinion it does a decent job. It has a certain sense of humor and to enjoy it you've got to like similar films such as independence day. I really liked that movie, so I like this one also. With lines such as ""mayor Ebert"" with the guy who looks like Roger Ebert, it's just too much fun.Back in the 90's, we had many original good films; so this was weak in comparison. It almost copies films such as independence day or Jurassic park. Two decades later with so many bad films being made this actually looks like a strong film. In my opinion, it's much more entertaining compared to the original 1954 film, and I give it higher points just for that.There's a limit to how much an original film with boring plot, bad effects can hold up after 60 years.6.5 out of 10",Godzilla
495,Elil,And you thought Garfield Gets Real was bad,2,9 July 2008,"Don't smug me, but Garfield Gets Real which is in the 4's on IMDb is actually pretty good. But this movie is absolutely terrible! So bad in fact, that it makes you wonder why this movie was messed up.The plot of the movie was terrible. After meaningless atomic bomb test on the South Pacific, a creature attacks a ship in the Panama Canal, I think. After being hired to investigate the matter, scientist Nick Tatopolous jumps to conclusion that it must of been a giant lizard created from those pointless explosions, and we know who he is. Godzilla makes his way to New York City and causes mahatma there, so he has to be defeated. Now it sounds simple, but they over-dumbed it by putting in stupid news reporter story stuff. We have an issue about news reporting with characters we're not fully introduce to. It seems like a strange complaint but the news issue was too long. It tended to drag on from 20 to 30 minutes, while I was waiting for another scene with Godzilla which is a little short and not really exciting.All the characters were laughable and unlikable. A example is Mayor Ebert and his aide, Gene (which is really insulting to Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel). The effects will not blow you away and the action scenes are not fun at all. So what could director Roland Emmerich do to make this movie even worse then putting stupid characters, lumpy effects, and boring action scenes? How about messing up Godzilla's design which ends up not looking like Godzilla at all. I couldn't believe how badly they screw up Godzilla's look in the movie. The producers put in the laziest opening sequence I have ever seen. I think they knew they were making a bad movie so they didn't care. All I saw were lizards and explosions which is kind of hard to figure out.The last and big complaint I have is the movie contains no references to the original Godzilla movies, aside from the name and roar, and doesn't have the Godzilla spirit. This could've been a great movie, if the script and Godzilla's design were faithful to the original Godzilla movies.The bottom line is Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin made the Godzilla movie all a disaster! The movie will bore and disappoint Godzilla fans.Do not buy this movie, do not watch this movie, do not even look at this movie. It's a sin that this movie was even made.",Godzilla
496,IvoryNaymex,An absorbing modern B-Movie,9,14 April 2006,"It is quite difficult, despite the apparent universal ease of its audience, to view Roland Emmerich's very well-made and neat B-movie 'Godzilla' in a negative light. From the opening titles, which clearly explain the origin of the title antagonist with a series of smoothly juxtaposed archive images of radioactivity tests and nuclear-bomb detonations with the French national anthem fading to nothing in the background being replaced by David Arnold's incredibly underrated score (and talent), is to me, a signal that this film is going to be of a very high quality and a riveting two-hour ride of escapism. And I turned out to be quite accurate in my title-sequence-induced hypothesis. The film does seem to me to be a successful homage to the original 'Godzilla' movies (for example, representatives of the nation that created the franchise are allowed to be the first of the monster's victims, Gojira is mentioned; something that apparently was part of the 'Godzilla' franchise and references to the original movies are made with shots of TV screens showing one of the movies) or if not that, a successful modern-take on a highly-dated franchise. However, I do not know how valid my opinion will be to actual fans of the original movies as I have not actually watched any of the original movies, but am evidence of the fact that this film stands alone as an original Hollywood blockbuster rather than an homage or remake of its Japanese counterparts.The film's story was pretty standard for a B-movie; an illegal scientific incident from the past has scientifically devastating effects in the future, in this case, French scientists having nuclear tests decades ago inadvertently fused the DNA of a number of reptile species that grew with its mutation to an extraordinary height and proceeded to attack a human-inhabited location, New York. Consequently, scientists and the military become involved to resolve the situation as well a cool French Secret Service agent who wants to cover up the evidence (that being Godzilla) of the French nuclear tests years ago. With appealing stars (a number of whom seemed to be from the cast of 'The Simpsons' for some reason) that played their roles well and inspired a sufficient amount of sympathy for me to want them to survive, rather than Emmerich's latest disaster flick, 'The Day After Tomorrow', in which in my opinion, the ice age was the hero.Running for approximately two hours and twenty minutes, the film was a highly watchable epic of a film that absorbed me completely with the first half or three-quarters of the film given to the monster, and the other quarter to its terrifying offsrping. It is this latter portion of the film that displays Roland Emmerich's talent for creating suspense that verges on being Spielbergian as it is very similar to the scene in 'Jurassic Park' where the velociraptors are hunting the children. But despite the detachment of narratives, the film does not seem misjointed regarding this split, it is similar to the split narratives of 'Jaws' where the first half was on the shore and the second was out at sea. The continuation of events was flowing with its icing-on-the-cake-like accompaniment of David Arnold's always enjoyable orchestral genius that rivals the likes of John Williams'.With gripping tongue-in-cheek action sequences, which are usually chase-sequences and a believable romance made appealing by an attractive female lead and Matthew Broderick's pleasant easy-going on-screen persona, the film is one that can be watched again and again despite pedantic responses from fans of the (highly dated) original movies.Ultimately, the question has to be asked; how can people like Peter Jackson's messy and over-long 'King Kong' and not like this tight, lean actioner?",Godzilla

The makers of the film have been consistent in their approach, they have gone for an entertaining film with LOTS of special effects and they don't take themselves seriously for a second. This is where the strength of this film lies. Many critics have complained about cardboard characters and no originality, well in my view, that's the whole point! This is made as a FUN movie, the thousands of clichés are there quite intentionally. It is the action and Godzilla himself that ""carrie"" the movie. If you tried going for character development in this film, you would get a ridiculous clash of styles. In a film where a several hundred feet tall lizard is attacking New York, any attempts at seriousness at any point would just be out of place and ridiculous (Armageddon springs to mind). As a European, it is also nice to see for once an American disaster movie without any of the sickening quasi-patriotism that so plagued films like ID4, Deep Impact and Armageddon.

I'm amazed at how much of ID4 we can see in this one. The main character could be the same guy basically. A forgotten scientist who gets drawn into the big events. He's still in love with his long-gone girlfriend. By the end of the movie they get together again. (btw, that annoyed me as hell! I really hated that girl, he should've chosen the other one).I don't think the acting was very bad. There were many good actors in the movie. They just had a bad script.The basic idea of the movie is not a bad one. I like the concept of ""Huge Godzilla-monster goes downtown New York"". You could do something very interesting with that.

509,SundanceKid,fairly average as monster films go,5,21 July 2000,"(warning: parts of this review *may* be interpreted as spoilers)This was an okay film - worth seeing once, I think. As monster films go, this was fairly average.The effects were good and well done. The acting was also quite good. The arguably main character, the monster, was amusingly maternal, and I found the scene depicting the hundreds of baby godzillas quite surreal.The part of this film I found particularly annoying was the rain. In Godzilla it rains 24-7 and it is constantly dingy and dark. You may say it adds to the atmosphere, but I found it a bit excessive. Also, there is one part where a guy comes face to face with the monster and just smiles nervously and waves to his mates, which I thought was annoyingly unrealistic. Of course, the whole film is unrealistic, but unrealistic in an acceptable kind of way.The last comment I want to make about this film is - I came out of the cinema feeling incredibly sorry for the monster. I really did. It wasn't an evil monster - all it did was try to feed its babies - and humans being humans, went and treated it as if it was a manifestation of Satan or something.I wouldn't advise you not to see it. What I will say is: should the chance come up, see it. But don't go too far out of your way to see it.Overall, it is a fairly unimaginative, fairly forgettable film, but with good effects. As I rate Godzilla as no more or less than an average film, I give it a neutral mark of 5/10.",Godzilla

They said it was a roller coaster ride, Yeah one that makes you wanna throw up.",Godzilla
513,Otohime,Leave Godzilla to the Japanese,1,13 March 2005,"Being a fan of the big green monster I was excited when this movie came out. What could be better than a new Godzilla flick, in English, fancy graphics and set in my home city? Everything. I'd rather watch the old 70's Godzilla cartoon than this, at least that was slightly funny.This movie made me wish I was blind and deaf. I gained a greater love and appreciation for a cheesy green suit with a man inside of it. I never knew I would miss that so much. This movie proves one thing: Better graphics doesn't make a better movie.I honestly regret seeing this, and add it to the top of my ""Movies that should not have been made"" list.",Godzilla

515,ambush_xx,I find myself watching it every time it comes on..,6,23 January 2009,"This is one of the movies that i end up watching every time it comes on TV. I know its not the best movie, but for some reason i can watch this movie without being bored every time. This is really strange because there are movies that i really liked the first time but i just cant stand to watch it again. An example is TDK; I loved it the first time but could hardly sit through it the second time.I don't know the exact reason i i like this movie but maybe its because its got very few scenes thats taxing on me. There are secens in TDK and Shawshank redemption(two movies i really love)that are a bit taxing for me, like the scenes involving Gordon's faked death and his family or the scenes involving the sisters in SR.I really like Mattew Broderick. I find his acting really unassuming and straightforward which is perfect for the role and i like the chemistry he shares with the girl. Coming to the plot there isn't really anything special or surprising(other than they finding a million egg in the garden), just the usual Hollywood disaster movie formula; thinking that they had killed the monster and then it coming back in the end. But the action scenes were well choreographed and the VG was top class. I Never remembering having noticing the VG, it seemed pretty natural(the matrix style dark/blue ambiance helps in that department).Overall really watchable movie(although not multiple times).",Godzilla
516,JadaDreams,Blech!,1,22 August 2003,"How is this film not in the bottom hundred? I've only walked out on a movie twice in my life, and this movie was one of those times.

518,JAPfeif,Definitely NOT a bad movie,9,20 October 2012,"Well, I was all set to write a review on the movie defending it from all the negative flack it gets and I admittedly assumed that when I logged on here all I would see were negative comments. Actually, I scrolled through two pages and found not one negative review, all positives, so I guess no defending is necessary! So I just want to add that this movie in NO WAY deserves all the criticism it gets. I am an avid fan of the original Godzilla series and have a subscription to G-Fan, so I totally appreciate most of J.D. Lees's comments and opinions. I just do not get the backlash against this movie, except for probably ONE reason. The name.I think most folks were expecting basically a remake of the original Godzilla, same look, same mannerisms, same often-times hokey behavior, and when they didn't get that, they complain and moan. I agree with a previous poster here....if Roland et. al. HAD done that, made a creature that was just like the original in THIS day and age, the movie really WOULD have gotten lambasted and shot down. Besides, they already TRIED that once, remember? (anyone recall GODZILLA 1985??.....practically a carbon-copy of the look of the original monster and if I recall, it wasn't exactly a blockbuster!). So the film makers tried something new, totally updated effects (and no one can deny that they were excellent), an interesting plot, a new twist on the original, a cast of likable characters...and it gets totally ripped apart.Which brings me to my original point I wanted to make. The name. I honestly believe that if the film (and monster) had NOT been called ""Godzilla"", just called ""Monstersaurus"" or something, and not been made to appear as the iconic monster from our childhood, the movie would have done great in more people's eyes (well, at least on the level as other similarly-themed films like INDEPENDENCE DAY, TWISTER, and such). The kiss of death for many people was that they felt the movie was trying to ""pass off"" this monster as ""Godzilla"". And they didn't like that.......they didn't like the idea of totally changing the look and actions of a very iconic pop culture figure.So yeah.....had the movie been called something else and not associated with Godzilla in any way, I think the outcome would have been way different. Because, there sure wasn't much else to complain about in this movie! It was great!! Just my two pennies!",Godzilla
519,kitchenaut-1,Very watchable compared to current releases.,6,11 April 2011,"Although it's not a particularly thoughtful or artistic film, no sane person expects it to be. It is a competently made and very watchable monster-disaster film, much more so than the voguish Cloverfield, which has stunningly bad characterisation, and a distinct lack of narrative structure. As a film, Cloverfield is woefully underwritten and the monster looks awkward and derivative of the creature in the excellent Host.The action sequences in Godzilla are far more intricately choreographed, and the monster is more convincingly rendered, which is saying a lot considering the CGI is ten years older, but then a number of modern CG films seem to trade fidelity for hyper-kinesis, so that everything is moving too fast to make out details, which is just conning the audience; there are very few money shots, like the Brachiosaur in Jurassic Park.There is a corny aspect, but it is charming, and not hopeless hokum, like 2012, which is probably the worst Emmerich film i've seen, and i've seen 10,000 BC.Like a lot of films of the mid to late nineties, there is assumption that the audience still have a respect for story, and most nineties films of this genre stand up quite well to the dross like the later Star Wars prequels, Transformers, Skyline and Clash of Titans, which have no sense of writing talent behind them, and the characters are just types.Even the effects of newer films look poor, due to aforementioned hyper-kinesis/ shaky-cam visuals.Why is it that most modern event movies are so poor on all fronts?",Godzilla

521,jazzyjerome,Not for Godzilla fans,1,4 May 2014,"I didn't like this movie at all words cannot describe how disappointed I was. I was expecting to see a Godzilla with good CGI special effects who breathed nuclear fire his main attribute. No fire, he didn't sound like the original and he didn't even look like the original. The only think I liked better was the special effects. The guy in the suit was cheesy looking but the movies were more entertaining.I don't know what they were thinking when they made this but they didn't have old school Godzilla fans in mind. This is more like a lame attempt to beat people out of their money and make a quick buck. I suppose if you didn't grow up watching the original you may enjoy it I think expecting an improve version of the original may have killed it for folks. For old school fans don't waste your time.",Godzilla
522,osariyurt,Don't understand the hate train,7,27 June 2020,"I had watched this movie in my childhood and was left in awe to the special effects as well as Godzilla himself. This was the first iteration of any Godzilla movie I had watched then.Now I am 33 years old and I watched many Godzilla movies, which are ""true to its nature"". After all these years I decided to give it a try to see what the hate is all about and I still enjoyed this piece like it was my first time. The sequences, the creature itself, the sound effects and special effects for 1998 were top notch.Many of the hate coming for this movie is because it's titled Godzilla and titular monster is not what we are used to see in many other Godzilla movies. It has no ulterior motive, not a titan, does not have a radiation breath etc. But this Godzilla is an overgrown lizard who just entered the waking world. Also it has some sort of a radiation breath since it blows up cars just by screaming at them, not in a beam shaped though. Also it's not immortal either.All and all, I think this was a solid entertainment movie. I will probably watch this in many years to come and still enjoy it since it gives everything I look for. I am not looking for the meaning of life in a Godzilla movie, I just want to see effects, get entertained and this film gives it all.And unlike newer Godzilla movies, human characters are not annoying as hell in this one. You can very well skip the human parts in new movies and will not lose a thing. Here, you may not lose anything either but you don't have to urge to skip the scenes with humans in the first place.Overall, a solid 7/10 is what this title deserves in my opinion.",Godzilla
523,godzilla_6000,Awesome monster thrill ride original nostalgic masterpiece!,10,9 January 2013,"Godzilla is truly a very well made success movie, with excellent special effects, great acting, and with a great realistic story! I just cant help but love this masterpiece film which I've loved since I was a kid. It is a true nostalgic film that I can watch any day. This is practically the best Godzilla-film I've ever seen, as the original from 1954/56 comes in second place and the rest right after. This film finally shows a Godzilla/Godzilla-monster that many people, who never really were fans nor impressed by the earlier Godzilla films and creatures, can love. The idea of taking Godzilla in a more realistic way was just great and it gave us the more realistic, cooler, and more lovable animal-like Godzilla that many of us always wanted. It is a thrill ride from the beginning to the end. I can literally watch it anytime.I really recommend this masterpiece of a monster/Godzilla-film. You can't do more than love it! The film really have great scenes with great animation and other special effects, it has all from cool, awesome, thrilling scenes to great love scenes, especially between the two characters that are played by Maria Pitillo and Matthew Broderick, they really were the best ones for the roles in this film, it's unforgettable, in a good way. There are really many great ideas and details in this film which many, especially haters, doesn't notice or just simply ignores, which is sad because of the genius story which makes this film so very special and which have inspired later Godzilla films and merchandise and really has an amazing legacy behind it. I recommend this film to everyone! It's certainly worth watching.",Godzilla
524,Nekrofoxx,Where's Godzilla?,5,2 February 2014,"It's a good movie to learn what not to do when a giant dinosaur comes into your city. But to be the Godzilla movie everyone wanted...it needs some work.The little things...the script is really cheesy, and the characters seem to be acting totally brain dead throughout the entire movie. It just doesn't make sense. But now onto the big thing...I can deal with the cast, the script and the brain dead characters....but. WHERE IS GODZILLA? Godzilla looks like a dinosaur off of Jurassic park. Nothing's wrong with Jurassic Park but I expect Godzilla to be amazing and look like the king of all monsters...sadly he doesn't come close. Even in the ending when Godzilla dies and Nick is face to face with him. I understand there's suppose to be a emotional connection they tried to build...but it just wasn't there and neither was the magic that could have made this film a epic classic. So many things were out of place. Starting with the look of Godzilla.",Godzilla
525,disturbedtacos,Dont look at it as a Godzilla film,6,21 May 2019,"I've seen so much hate for this movie just because it's called Godzilla. If you take that name away and look at as it's own monster movie, then it's a pretty enjoyable popcorn monster flick. The acting can be cheesy at times, or just not up to par, but the action sets are fun and the effects are fairly decent given its age. I'm a massive Godzilla fan so I can understand the hate this movie has. But if you can block out that association then you have a fun creature feature that could have been more accepted if they didn't tack on the Godzilla name",Godzilla
526,gzilla1998,This film should quite simply be renamed,4,28 July 2014,"This is such a sad, misunderstood film on all accounts. ""Godzilla"" 1998 is probably one of the worst adaptations ever. Godzilla himself really isn't present at all in the monster character featured: A radical re- design, a cowardly nature, being a biological parent to raptors, death by military, etc. It's no wonder why Toho, Godzilla's parent studio, completely segregated the character from Godzilla, copyrighted it as Zilla, and made it the subject of joke and ridicule in at least two of their later pictures. This film should not be counted as a Godzilla film, reducing the count to 29 movies in total. While it's a horrible Godzilla film, the movie is a decent popcorn flick to watch occasionally if you butt out Godzilla himself. The characters are really not that great, Nick Tatapolus, Animal, and Philipe are just as caricature in nature as all of the characters in Michael Bay's Transformer series. The acting isn't so hot either, Audrey being the worst easily, not to mention the script is occasionally atrocious and meaningless dialogue is everywhere, especially during the beginning. The CGI effects are also dated and cheesy looking when you compare them to Godzilla (2014). However, the monster sequences are still fun to watch and are still entertaining, even if there are a few rip-offs from Jurassic Park here and there. Overall, this movie is a half decent monster flick, but a terrible re-adaptation/imitation of the Godzilla character. Although it may hold nostalgia for myself and others, it's really not as good as some people might try to point out. If you're looking for a monster movie, this one isn't too bad. If you are looking for a Godzilla movie, please stay away from this. It's probably best forgotten and left to sit in the dollar bin.",Godzilla

If it comes on the telly, and there's nothing else on; yeah go for it. Otherwise, not worth it.I goes on far too long, and also I really thought the idea of Godzilla being pregnant was utterly ridiculous. After that, it just turns into Jurassic Park, with hundreds of dinosaurs running about. Should thought about wrapping it up when they first hit the monster. Although it would have made for quite a short movie if they had done that. Maybe some more action to fill in the gaps. To be fair, there is A LOT of destruction, and New York gets pretty much obliterated, but more of that, and more combat with the beast would have been better, rather than crawling about hiding from mini-Godzillas.",Godzilla

531,ryoga_2003,Where's Ghidora and Gamera?,2,12 March 2006,"Isn't Godzilla (alongside some kid or group of kids) supposed to be the hero of the film? With the exception of this and the first film, Godzilla is the pseudo-savior of Tokyo. Albeit, while he levels half the city, he is always doing it to defeat the real villains or monsters. This film didn't have that. Heck, there is only one or two Japanese people in the entire film.Real Godzilla films have the following... ~Godzilla is breathes radioactive fire. ~Godzilla never actually intends to destroy the city. It is always a side effect of his fighting the monsters that want to destroy the city.~The movies are always based in Japan, primarily Tokyo.~Godzilla fights other monsters. These other monsters (Ghidora, Megalon, space Godzilla) are the real bad guys.This film did not have any of that. Part of the whole appeal of the real Godzilla films is the cheaper graphics, the man in a lizard suit, poorly dubbed voices, and NO Americans. (I don't hate us, it's just that we have a tendency to want things our way only)Let's face it, the only thing really going for this was the clean look of the film. And as a final thought, why DID Godzilla go to New York? (New York belongs to King Kong) Why didn't he go for Los Angeles or Seattle? Both are closer to the south pacific.Verdict: Godzilla belongs in Tokyo, facing other monsters, whilst destroying parts of Japan. This film is not a Godzilla film. It's sci-fi film that resembles Godzilla films.",Godzilla

Slightly above-par effects could not make-up for shoddy acting (especially from Maria Pitillo), poor dialogue, and supposedly tense scenes which lacked their key ingredientsuspense. Broderick was also a major disappointment.  However, he was not given any intelligent lines and he is not an action hero.

536,GregoryK,Below my lowest expectations,2,10 September 1998,"First, I should explain that I'm not really expecting much from a film that is basically an Americanized CGI update of a man in a rubber reptile suit stomping on toy buildings and tanks. But based on what Mssrs. Devlin and Emmerich have delivered, I'll take repeat viewings of the old Japanese movies any day. Even the bad ones, like ""Godzilla on Monster Island "".Let's just take this point by point:1) Characters with no personality2) A monster with even less personality3) Can somebody explain to me what was supposed to be so funny about the Ebert and Siskel characters?4) Ending stolen directly from DeLaurentis' ""King Kong"" - note to Dean and Roland - if you're going to borrow, at least borrow from a GOOD flick!Final assessment: If there is a plan for a sequel, let's just give it to Schumacher. Based on how he tanked the Batman sequels, he would be a natural for the benchmark set by this garbage.",Godzilla

It was enjoyable and had some good lines.In fact, I especially enjoyed Matthew Broderick playing his usual understated character.  The French Secret Service agents and their comments about our fast food were also good for a chuckle.There was, however, too much gratuitous profanity for what was essentially a children's flick.  It detracted from the story and, if it had not been there, would have made this a better movie.",Godzilla

540,BeamMeUp,"A roller-coaster of a thrill ride, yet with a detracting sub-plot",6,8 November 1998,"This movie completely blew me away.  It definitely wasn't what I was expecting, which worked in both good and bad ways for it.First: the effects.  Uncanny.  True, there were some rare occasions where the monster looked almost as campy as the old Japanese movies, but overall, I'd put them just under Jurassic Park.  From the first half-hour onward, until the credits rolled, the whole movie seemed to be one gigantic climatic scene, leaving my heart beating almost twice as fast as when I first sat down to watch it.Second: the plot (& sub-plots).  The plot going on through the entire movie of the three friends and Matthew Broderick, as well as the whole deal with the news station, really killed the plot for me.  It seemed that Maria Pitillo was just whining the entire movie.  Her character was a complete waste of film.  The movie should have concentrated on the team containing Broderick and Vicky Lewis, whose character could have been evolved much more than was.Hank Azaria was good in his role, and Jean Reno was great, although the sub-plot with the French really could have been smoothed over and explained in more detail; it stuck out like a sore thumb.  Also, the entire Madison Garden scene seemed to be ripped off from Jurassic Park, however it probably was the most intense scene in the whole movie.And how could we forget pudgy Mayor Ebert and his bald friend Gene.  What was with that?  Probably the single stupidest thing in the whole movie.  The only reason I could see for putting them in here is to garner points with Siskel and Ebert.  Terrible idea.Overall, I did enjoy the movie, but it could have been improved immensely by revamping and/or removing some or all of the subplots.  Let's hope they fix their plot problems in the sequel.Out of 10, I give it a 7.",Godzilla

Obviously the storytelling is lame and the premise is ridiculous. The effects everyone hyped were awful. Godzilla moved and acted like a CGI monster and the entire movie had to be dark and rainy to hide the Softimage CGI animations. Microsoft's softimage software recently purchased by Avid should have been blown up along with the baby zillas in Madison Square Garden. The best part of this film was the very last credit because I knew that it was finally over. Why do people buy tickets to movies like this?

(bored!)  The exception to this was the acting of Jean Reno, who's always the sauve, tough and adept international man, this time in a ""friendly"" role.Some New Yorkers liked this film, in as much as it's always a kick for us to see our town get blown up by the inept military that's chasing this monster.

I did my ultimate best to ignore them, but one hour into this, so-called cliches became virtually impossible to ignore!!!Acting was abysmal. Even I could've done a better job. Matthew Broderick was simply awful. It looked as though he was forcing his lines with no effort whatsoever. As for his girlfriend, her acting was worse. It would have been nice to see the lizard eat her!  Some reviewers likened this to light-hearted slapstick comedy. Slapstick Comedy??? More like slapstick farce!! None of this drivel was slightly amusing!There are mind boggling scenes: submarines in rivers firing torpedoes - and said rivers looked more like oceans. Helicopters quite capable of flying up to escape stomping, chomping building-sized dumb lizard - but flies forward all the way. Most mind-boggling of all - how in the world can a giant 20-story tall dinosaur hide in New York subways?? Oh yes, we mustn't forget the hundreds of eggs it laid in a stadium building and somehow going completely unnoticed. And then there is the unbelievable climatic ending in a New York Yellow Cab.There are dozens more along this vein, but space wouldn't allow me to put them in, such as Guess What Scene We Copied This From. There are enough scenes in this to infringe the copyrights of nearly a dozen other movies, don't movies have copyrights?MY CONCLUSION? So its a kids movie.

548,keithfox,Brave try???,2,2 May 2001,"This film starts out with a great deal of promise, but soon degenerates into a display of the efforts of the special effects department to dazzle the viewer. Unfortunately the story line somehow gets lost in all of this. A major glitch occurs when the creature, Godzilla, has attacked New York but disappears, only to be found underground when Matthew Broderick opens a man hole cover. A creature of this size can burrow underground without leaving a trace? NO WAY. The creature then pops out and once more terrorizes the city. The city is supposed to go through an evacuation, but, if this happens, it is cleverly concealed, since it remains populated with myriads of people. The creature supposedly lays a few zillion eggs, requiring massive efforts to destroy them, apparently successful until the ending. I wonder how Matthew Broderick managed to get himself trapped into this turkey. He was excellent in Torch Song Trilogy, The Freshman and Glory, but this was a real mistake for him. I think he needs to fire his agent and get a better one.",Godzilla
549,pypr417,"Mediocre,yet an enjoyable film",9,13 August 2000,"Godzilla is a good film for the whole family to enjoy.  The lack of blood and gore make it suitable for the young'uns (though you may want to tell them not to say some of those naughty little words) straight up to the elderly.  As for the film itself, what kept it from being a classic monster film and one that could be forgotten in a few years is the lack of intelligence of the people. To start, the poor old fisherman in the beginning he stands their so long waiting on godzilla to turn him into a fishersmear I thought he had died standing there with his hands on his face.The next example of sheer stupidity (the next example I'm going to tell you about, not the next example of unsmartness in the film by the way) is our nations army/air force, they did so many stupid things I thought it was a joke, for instance, at one point they had a group of men armed with M-16's,yes,you heard right,no,this is not a joke they had M-16's to fight a 300 foot tall monster they brought M-16's,why, those things barely work on people. Ok, the last bit of dumbness I will address,are our next country neighbors the frenchman, when Nick, and that french fella were trying to get clearance into the city, a guard stops and asks him, why they were there and who they were  Nick talks to him instead of the French guy (when the French guy should have spoken by the way)the guard blows up at Nick because he's just a soldier and not a high ranking officer (he's actually neither but)anyway, the guard asks frenchie overhere could was something wrong with him and he says in a fake southern accent  ""Why, no sir.""  now my question is if he could fake an American accent why didn't he do it to begin with? I could go on and on but I won't. Oh one more thing if it sounds like I don't like the its not true I love the French. These French in Godzilla just didn't play intelligent parts. Cest'la vie(whatever that means)!",Godzilla

Man, time flies because I vividly remember when this movie came out and the excitement it caused.I thought when the movie came out it would be good because of the filmmakers.Personally, I didn't care for the story. However, being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence, these wonderful Godzilla cartoons you watched.Anyway, this is simply OK entertainment. I do not think a sequel will ever be made. This is the problem of not getting it right the first time.",Godzilla
552,vikingscap,Not Roland Emmerich Material,4,11 March 2007,"The most disappointing aspect of this movie was not its almost-always crappy special effects, below-F-grade acting, or even the script that was probably written by a twelve-year-old with ADD. It's the fact that this piece of crap was the work of movie-making wizard Roland Emmerich.It's astounding how bad this movie reeks compared to Emmerich's other groundbreaking titles, such as Stargate, the Patriot, and the Day After Tomorrow. Granted, this movie may be good compared to other Godzilla movies, but to anything else it's a C-level monster flick.Am I being too hard on it? I don't think so. I usually give movies more leeway than most, and it's surprising because I thought I would love this movie. I'm a sucker for giant reptiles roaring and blowing up buildings and stuff like that. But this was poorly done, for many reasons.One: the special effects. This movie must have been released the month that computer graphics started being used, cause this is some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. Except for a few instances (when Godzilla's underwater, for example) you almost want to barf at how fake it looks. Almost every time you see Godzilla, and especially his babies, they're nothing more than cloudy animations that stand out against the background. Emmerich's other movies seem to have jaw-dropping effects, so this came as a surprise to me as well.Two: the sound. There are three explosions where you hear the same effect of a tiger roaring. Almost every time Godzilla opens his mouth, you hear an elephant, perhaps mixed with a lion or a car engine. I bet the sound effects team had a blast at the zoo during their one week of work. I would've liked to hear more imaginative and original sounds...something that sounds more like a dinosaur than that stupid frikkin' elephant.Three: the acting. Whoever thinks that Matthew Broderick delivered a stunning performance in this movie obviously hasn't seen any others in their entire life. I have seen better acting in high school...no, middle school productions. It's almost as if they rehearsed for one night, then filmed everything and got the heck outta dodge. Nobody in this movie carried out their full potential as an actor. It makes me cringe.And I could go on and on about the script (nothing was funny, by the way), the endless clichés (some idiot gets hired by the government, finds his long-lost love...even the egg hatching at the end), and everything else about it that belongs in the ""miscellaneous"" category of stupid (Godzilla NOT eating Matthew Broderick in the first fish scene, starting the car with a knife, and the old Asian man somehow understanding the Frenchman's English, thus uttering the name of the creature).That being said, the only reason I took the time to finish the movie and write this review was because I rented it for $2.50 and spent almost two hours watching it that I know I'll never get back. Please take this as a warning. If you appreciate movies and expect much of them, this film will only disgust and disappoint. If you're a devoted Godzilla fan (non-purist, by the way) that doesn't really care about plot line, acting, etc. and can stand to see the crappy special fx (as well as listen to overused animal sounds), go right ahead and watch it.",Godzilla
553,leemo72,"Judge it on itself, not by the Japanese versions",8,26 September 2004,"Yes I know a lot of other reviewers keep comparing this to the Japanese versions. Don't. Yes, this movie lacks in the acting department, (""Animal's"" wife and Nick's reporter girlfriend, for instance.) But for a science fiction movie it explains itself pretty well. How Godzilla was created, why it goes to Manhattan, etc. Most importantly though, in my opinion, this movie lacks all the sex, smut, blood and guts that movie makers of today want to cram their movies with. I had no problem letting my 6 and 9 yr olds watch this movie. Yes, there is plenty of property damage, but overall I would consider this a perfect movie for the junior set. Plenty of action and excitement, without all the garbage.",Godzilla

But none of them would prevent me from recommending it for your next family movie night. It has something for the whole family.I purchased this movie when my kids (particularly my son) were around 8-10 yrs old. He fell in love with it. The scientific information is explained in a manner that is easy to understand and it has NO foul language, ""blood/gore"" scenes or anything else that any normal parent with at least half a brain would object to.This film offers plenty for grown-ups as well. There are tons of ""inside jokes"" that will soar right over your kid's heads and settle directly on your funny bones. It satires many clichés (soldiers chewing gum because it makes them look ""more American"") and the spoofs of Siskel & Ebert are a hoot. Sure it gets campy at times, but that's part of the fun! My only real criticism of this movie is Maria Pitillo (Audrey Timmonds) acting. I hope she took the money she earned from this movie and got some acting lessons. But considering the campiness of this film, it doesn't detract from the viewer's enjoyment of the film.I know a lot of die-hard Godzilla fans took issue with this movie's not sticking with the true 'spirit' of previous Godzilla films, but this is American Godzilla, not a Japanese one - and I think this film deserves a lot more credit than it received.",Godzilla
555,starelf-1,Fantastic movie but not Godzilla,10,16 November 2008,"Probably one of the best films in the giant monster genre. The special effects are fantastic and the monster if highly believable. I fully agree with everyone here praising the movie. But I felt I needed to explain to those folks who don't understand why so many of the original fans don't like the film.By any monster movie fans standards this would be an utterly loved classic if you had given the monster any other name. Many of the fans name this monster GINO (Godzilla in Name Only) and that about sums up the real reason they hate the film. Through all the iterations and different directors in the Toho films, cheesy as they can be, Godzilla (Gojira) developed and maintained a very distinct character. He is an unstoppable force of nature to which humanity is a mere annoyance that at times he deems to help but mostly puts us in our place for overstepping our bounds.Its fairly obvious early on that the writers and director of this movie made no effort to understand or capture that character in their creation. Perhaps that can be forgiven since their stated goal was to try and create a Godzilla that moved and acted like a real giant lizard would act and they largely succeeded but in the process they totally lost the 'soul' of the original character. Their creation has a soul and personality to be sure but its just not Gojira's.I remember watching the movie in the theater for the first time with my wife during the scene with the helicopters chasing the Godzilla through the maze of buildings. I leaned over to her and said the first thing that came to my mind, ""Godzilla doesn't run from helicopters"" He just doesn't. He might change direction out of annoyance but not run away.I think most hard core fans will admit in private that this is a good film but publicly they just can't get over what they see is a completely wrong portrayal of a beloved character.TOHO even played off on the comparisons between this Godzilla and the original by pitting her(?)against the original in Godzilla: Final Wars in one of the most one sided, quickest defeats in the film.",Godzilla
556,Ragrits,Godsake,2,10 July 2009,"Skipping all the rubbish at the start of the movie, the movie properly starts with a man fishing at the end of a pier in rainy Manhattan. He catches a fish! Oh it's a bigun! The fish is putting up a fight, but he is reeling this bad boy in. Oh no wait IT'S FREAKIN' GODZILLA and Godzilla is hacked off. But suddenly the 1000 tonne monster who is as tall as a skyscraper runs off and disappears... in Manhattan... and this brings me on to my first point.Through out the movie Godzilla frequently comes out of nowhere and does some godzillarly stuff then runs off again into Manhattan and disappears. I don't know that much about Godzilla, but I doubt he employs the tactic of a black man in Philly and does drive-bys.Another problem with the movie is there is a giant monster running around, destroying Manhattan... so who do the US Army call on for help? a Dinosaur expert? a weapons specialist? No, a guy who researches worms. To add insult to injury, this worms expert completely ignores the US Army and enlists the help of the France's answer to the CIA, Jean Reno, but that's okay, because he is as cool as a cucumber.Overall, I'd have more fun attaching jump leads to my nipples.",Godzilla
557,weyoun790,Godzilla the friendly lizard creature versus his Fruedian alterego,7,6 February 2002,"Brilliant special effects really bring Godzilla to life in a way that far surpasses the original films and only fails to compete with the parabolic meanings behind the classic, although some grate comic performances and witty dialog make the transfer from low budget mayhap to blockbuster smash hit more bearable in a film which has been underrated by most critics.Where most misinformed critics go wrong is to project some sought of romanticised view of Godzilla as `man's best friend' and `defender of the innocent' (as if he were some 100ft tall Lassie compared to the original incarnation who tore up everthing in his path) or classify it as a farcical monster movie which is thankfully not what it is aboutin keeping faithful to the original. The black and white classic, which started the whole thing off, was trying to explore very relevant concepts before it became a ridiculous B movie franchise. It confronted a philosophical paradoxic in human nature as man is both a creative and destructive creature which is culminated in the symbol of the atom bomb in bothnfilms. The atom bomb which in the original film releases Godzilla from hibernation is the closes thing we have to witnessing the explosion, which scientists say, birthed our universe all those millions of years ago. Godzilla symbolises a part of mankind's duel nature, a repression of his psyche which had lad dormant for thousands of years and had been supposedly tamed over centuries of Enlightenment and rationalism but in fact the very thing which unleashes this creature is one of man's greatest scientific discoveries and greatest human disaster.So what is more poignant than this creature arising out of a post war Japan to as a result of man not learning from his mistakes and takes on the persona of man's self destructiveness even in the midst of peace time.For some very obvious reasons this is a story that is almost impossible to rival in terms of its parabolic significance as it was released in the wake of the events of Horroshima and Nagasaki in a climate of what in hiensight of the arms race seemed even more relevant with the MADness (Mutualy Assured Distruction) policy of the US. So what have the writers of the new film done but tried to accommodate some allegorical comment while really concentrating on a monster movie that would blow over the public. The theme of recompense is central as the creature is nature bitting back at mankind who has abused her and in the new film in a subtle plot twist [possible spoiler alert] Godzilla through asexual reproduction posses a even greater threat of replacing man as the dominant species. Where as in the originalfilm it took a new weapon that could match the atom bomb in it destructive potential but developed ironically enough by a pacifist we have a final balance of the two forces when the creature is destroyed and all trace of the new weapon which apeases this conflict in taking the life of a willing participant in the creation of new scientific wounders which manipulated to a destructive end. In the new film we do not have this reconsiliation there is a relationship built up between the creature and Broderick's character which convey the overwhelming sense of awe and respect for the creature prooving he may have understood the irony even if the writers have not. It is all culminating in the final scene with the creature outwhitted it seems it is only Broderick who has really recognised the creature for what it is.",Godzilla
558,xnoxreturnx,One of my favorite movies =],10,24 February 2008,"I don't remember seeing Godzilla the first time, but it is still ONE of my favorite movies of all time. They make Godzilla MUCH more then just a crazy monster who wants to rule over the earth. All she wants to do is raise her family, she cannot help it if she is super huge. And it is obvious she loves her children for when she is dead you can see the sadness upon her expression as she looking at the humans who killed them off.It's also very heartbreaking when they finally kill her. I think they should have taken her to an unknown island so she can live peacefully.I've also seen the 'other' Godzilla movies. like the one where Godzilla is 'fighting' another creature. These movies SUCK. I mean my 6 year old nephew could make a better movie then those >.< Those make me SO angry. The ONLY good Godzilla movie is THIS one. All the other ones are poorly made.

I'm actually watching it right now and I can't believe how bad the acting is. The whole opening scene is dumb Godzilla is supposed to be a dinosaur not a mutated iguana. Also so far nobody has gotten eaten nor does it look like much damage to NYC at least in ID4 the totally wrecked NY. too bad that they couldn't have created something similar to the original movies.

Firt of all Godzilla is not a guy in a rubber suite anymore but looks like and moves like a realistic living thing.Don't get me wrong in this but for the 50s a guy in a rubber suite and no script was OK and passable but wanting from a new movie to be exactly as an old one is absurd.Secondly no death rays no trying to destroy as many buildings as it can and at the end you find out she just wanted to nest in New York, you almost feel sad for killing it in the finale.So i give it 10 out of 10 for being excellent in every technical aspect good acting and for being exactly what you should wait for a movie of this kind.",Godzilla
561,conorwall,Godzilla in NYC,10,19 August 2010,"OK for starters i'm probably the only Godzilla fan in the world who liked this film. the plot concerns a group of scientists (Dr. Niko Tatopoulos ,Dr. Elsie Chapman and Dr. Mendel Craven) who have been rounded up by Colonel Hicks to study Godzilla an iguana irradiated by nuclear tests. it is also the first of its kind and it decides no make NYC it's nesting grounds for the thousands of eggs it was soon to lay. here in NYC is also where we find Audrey Timmonds nick's college girlfriend and Victor ""Animal"" Palotti a camera man who is a friend of Audrey. now since Godzilla invaded NYC obviously it would be the news story of a lifetime so Audrey and victor decide to try and get it on tape and victor is almost crushed by Godzilla's foot in the process. soon after Godzilla's first attack mayor Eberto (played by none other than ...well Eberto)decides to evacuate the city and find a way to put a halt on Godzilla permanently. meanwhile hicks nick Elsy and craven decide what the best way to stop Godzilla would be the nick suggests that the best way to stop Godzilla is not to force him out but to draw him out. so they decide to use mountains of fish so Godzilla will smell the bate and come to them. the plan works but also backfires seeming as Godzilla escapes destroys 4 choppers and in the process destroys the Chrysler building. after this happens we see nick and Audrey in the tent discussing the creature when Audrey decides to steal a top secret tape of Early footage of Godzilla never seen before. then after her story is seen on TV by the army they decide to boot him out of the assignment. as nick leaves new york Audrey tries to apologize but unfortunately nick isn't so forgiving seeing as this is the second time Audrey has emotionally scarred nick.after this happens the army hunts down and finally manages to kill Godzilla with the shot of a submarine torpedo. when nick leaves NYC the cab driver kidnapped him and tells him his name is Philippe Roche and wants to find the eggs that Godzilla has laid as much as nick dose. when they are seen at the base of Philippe and his men it is soon discovered that they are not alone and that victor has been spying on them. after this discovery victor decides to tell Audrey that nick is planning to destroy the eggs and he wants Audrey to come with him to tell the world of nick's heroics surly enough she agrees and they follow nick and the others to Madison square garden where the eggs have been laid. soon the thousands of eggs begin to hatch and Audrey and victor meet up with nick and Philippe where they participate in a chase throughout the garden and are hunted down by the baby Godzilla's. soon they find a camera hooked up to the news station Audrey works at and they use it to contact the army for help. it is then discovered that they have less than 6 minutes to escape before the building blows up. our heroes get away but a shocking discovery is made that Godzilla never died and chased nick and the others to the Brooklyn bridge where they all take place in a car chase across the bridge.soon the army is notified and finally destroy the creature on the bridge as our heroes just manage to escape. but after Godzilla is dead it turns out that there is one last egg and it was set up for a sequel that never happened but there was an animated series that continued the story that i also highly recommend. all in all i don't get Way everyone hated this film so much i can understand being disappointed by the fact that Godzilla doesn't have his trademark atomic breath but other than that its a fun entertaining movie and is Roland's finest work in my opinion. great flick check it out.",Godzilla
562,Anorensic,Criminally Underated...By Fans of Godzilla!!,8,2 August 2020,"Ok so the Godzilla in the movie is not really Godzilla (a creature that can't be destroyed, hence the name God-zilla); it was more like an over-sized T-Rex and a mortal one at that. But it's still a different take on the iconic Godzilla series and if one gives it a chance, it kind-of grows on you. I remember they used to show this on cable TV all the time and I always used to stop (winding through the channels) to watch some of the scenes. This movie has a blend of humor (almost as if it's not taking itself seriously at times) and the casting of Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria is just perfect, and the girl is cute too (""it's Gojira you moron!""). It has it's share of a stereotypical Hollywood action-flick moments (which I found myself smiling at), because it was all done in a humorous way. The movie is no masterpiece by any means, but last I saw, this had a criminal rating of 4.2, now thankfully up to just about 5.5; but I feel (looking back now) this movie should have a solid rating of 6.5 to 6.9..",Godzilla
563,alexconsalvos,"My Personal Review of ""GODZILLA (1998).""",10,6 August 2013,"OK, let me just start of by saying this: I am NOT going to try to force others to feel the same way about this film as I do, NO. But I do have to be honest here and just come out and say it: I am seriously SICK AND TIRED of all of the negative hardcore Godzilla purist BULL HONKY that ""Godzilla 1998"" keeps getting! I mean, to simply say ""I don't like this movie,"" state your valid reasons why (in a NICE and RESPECTABLE manner), and just leave it at that, I can honestly accept viewpoints like that. But what I can't accept are many hardcore Godzilla fans taking the TriStar film WAY to seriously, OVER-BLOWING their negative opinions on it to RIDICULOUS levels, and treating the movie like it shouldn't have existed. THAT I CANNOT except, and trashing a movie like this in that exact manner SERIOUSLY CANNOT BE.OK, with that said, I just want to say that I am a true fan of ""Godzilla 1998"" and I always will be. NOBODY is going to force me to think of this film differently, NOBODY. Now do not get me wrong, I WAS familiar with the classic Toho Godzilla and I truly LOVE the original Big G and everything that has made him a cultural icon. I like to think of Roland Emmerich's 100% American take on Godzilla (which is what it's SUPPOSED to be in the first place)as a very fun, entertaining movie that has a well-executed plot/story that actually makes sense (for me at least), very well-developed human characters that are relate-able as real people and move the narrative along, and a creature that IS a very realistic depiction of Godzilla.Now I've heard about the scientific inaccuracies related to this film, and I say that conventional scientific thinking DOES NOT APPLY AND IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO APPLY. You see, in this movie, even though Godzilla (or ""Zilla"" as the film's creature is now called) is a mutated marine iguana, that's just what he is, a MUTANT. He's MUTATED. Conventional scientific knowledge and facts about real-life marine iguanas honestly DOESN'T APPLY because Godzilla (a.k.a. Zilla) is a MUTANT. His entire anatomy and body structure has adjusted to suit a very different lifestyle & diet. His reproductive system has also developed in a way it which it's SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT from how most other reptiles reproduce. Plus, ""Zilla"" has to have SOME WAY of spreading his species, so the way the movie handles it makes sense. And by the way, about the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park?"" If you remember from that film, SOME of the dinosaurs TRANSFORMED THEIR GENDER AND BECAME MALES. In ""Godzilla 1998,"" he has the ability to REPRODUCE ASEXUALLY, there's a difference between the two. Finally, the Baby Godzillas (a.k.a. Baby-Zillas) are NOT rip-offs of the ""Jurassic Park"" Velociraptors! They look EXACTLY like their parent, only in baby form, people! SHEESH!Now I don't know about anyone else out there, but I believe the main reason for the negative bashing from both the hardcore Godzilla fans and the critics is that people keep comparing this to the Toho Godzilla series when really, ""Godzilla 1998"" SHOULDN'T be compared with the latter and I don't think it's supposed to be compared with the Toho films at all. This, to me, is a 100% American, alternate universe version of the same character of Godzilla. I repeat: A 100% American, ALTERNATE UNIVERSE VERSION OF THE SAME CHARACTER OF GODZILLA. That's how I see it, and there may be folks out there who see this in a similar fashion. It's NOT supposed to be compared to the Toho films at all because when Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin set out to make ""Godzilla 1998,"" they had it in their minds to give America IT'S OWN GODZILLA while keeping their version true to the original in some ways. For example, ""Zilla (I personally call him Godzilla, but that's just me)"" does have a breath weapon. I really DON'T CARE NOR SHOULD IT REALLY MATTER what exactly comes out of his mouth. In my mind, as long as something deadly comes out of his mouth, then Godzilla USA has a breath weapon just like his Toho counterpart. Also, most conventional military weapons really DON'T do any thing to stop him; they just leave tiny scratches on his body. Not even submarine torpedoes could kill him! And even though ""Zilla"" didn't completely destroy all of New York, he truly DID DESTROY stuff in general (vehicles, villages, boats and a fishing ship). Finally, there are plates on ""Zilla's"" back just like his Japanese counterpart. Should it really matter what exact shape the plates are? I say 'NO, NOT REALLY' to that. Bottom line, if this film's creature has a breath weapon, is near-invincible, and has plates on his back, then he's good enough for me as GODZILLA. Most others will disagree with me on this review, but that's truly OK. I really do respect other people's opinions on ""Godzilla 1998"" even though I don't agree with them. All I wanted to do here is put in my own personal two cents about this film. And while it's fan-base isn't nearly as big as the one surrounding the Toho series, TriStar's film IS loved & supported by a good number of people (myself included). And really, that makes me smile!So in conclusion, I personally give ""Godzilla 1998"" 5 out of 5 stars in all conventional areas of film-making, cinematic storytelling, character & relationship development, and action & creature design/animation. So this is me, signing off. Enjoy!",Godzilla

565,barrowfam0512,"Don't Hate The Monster, Hate The Movie",6,21 April 2014,"Hard to believe it's been 16 years since we were force-fed this film! But, on the eve of a new Godzilla thrashing theaters, I felt the urge to see a blast from our G-Fan past. Fortunately, much of the hatred for Zilla '98 has died down (mostly due to anticipation for the upcoming redemption by Hollywood next month).While I could sit here and write volumes and volumes on 'the bad' of the film, I think it's been done to death. Instead, I'd like to focus on some of the 'good' the film had to offer (yes, there was SOME good to the film). For parents, this movie is what I could call a ""safe"" G-flick (much like the original Toho films). By this, I mean there's barely a foul word uttered, no graphic violence I can recall, and no ""every film's gotta have one"" sex scene. I felt it was safe enough for my 8 year old step-daughter to watch (yes, my step-DAUGHTER loves Godzilla! I'll make a Jedi out of her yet!).The action is over-the-top, well in line for a Godzilla movie. Lots of Godzilla stomping (away from the military), big and loud building explosions (mostly by the military), and absurd amounts of ""under-the-line"" references to other sci-fi and action films (mostly by the military). There's a lot in Zilla '98 for giant monster fans, action movie fans, and summer ""popcorn"" movie fans.As a giant monster movie, Zilla '98 works, and it works rather well. For a Godzilla film, maybe not so much. I myself have accepted it as part of the Godzilla mythology, much in the way as ""Halloween-III: Season Of The Witch"", or maybe ""Friday The 13th Part-V: A new Beginning"". It will forever be razzed as a Godzilla film. But, if you look past that, and see it more as a giant monster film, it's not half bad. In the end: don't hate the monster, hate the movie.",Godzilla

It is not a bad movie, but this is not Godzilla, not the Godzilla storlyine, and has nothing to do with the orginal Godzilla.",Godzilla
569,Aquateen1717,Guess Who's Coming To Town,5,6 July 2005,"Gone is the guy in the baggy, rubber suit tromping through starkly lit minatures sets of a Japan. Enter the slick, computer-generated Godzilla, as he crashes through New York skyscrapers leaving huge holes through the middle of them. No more tiny cars glued to over passes, waiting for Godzilla to stomp on them. Instead, Godzilla '98 blows cars hundreds of feet in the air with the breath from his roar. A cross between Jurassic Park's T-Rex and a giant lizard, this Godzilla is a technical marvel. He is remarkably fast and agile, cleverly evading heat sinking missiles and casually ignoring rounds of artillery shells puncturing his reptilian skin. Unfortunately, improved film-making techniques don't necessarily mean a better movie.The new Godzilla is revealed to be a by-product of nuclear testing in French Polynesia who manages to swim all the way to Manhattan with out being detected along the way. He has come to New York City for no apparent reason other than to nest. It seems Godzilla reproduces asexually and has chosen Madison Square Garden to lay his eggs. As usual in movies of this sort, the only person who realizes Godzilla's true animal instincts (Matthew Broderick) is summarily dismissed by the military because secret information in his possession was leaked to the press by a dim-witted ex-girlfriend (Maria Pitillio) trying to prove herself a worthy reporter. Meanwhile the baby Godzilla's hatch and run-a-muck in Madison Square Garden, but are bombed by military aircraft before they can descend upon the city. Seeing all his dead offspring, papa Godzilla goes on an all out rampage and this last fifteen minutes of the film offers the most exciting and entertaining sequences of the entire two hours and thirty minutes.The original Godzilla movies, all 22 of them, were genuinely silly, but you rightfully assume a $120 million remake to rise above the cheesy and knock your socks off. Well, the visual effects are far from cheesy, but they don't show you anything you haven't seen before, many times before. Initially it's impressive to see the sheer size of this beast and the way he lithely maneuvers among the buildings of Manhattan. But eventually you tire of his massive feet coming down and crunching cars and people-whose bodies you somehow never see in his wake. In fact, Godzilla doesn't eat people unless they smell like fish (his favorite snack) or kill his babies.One would have expected David Arnold (Tomorrow Never Dies) to write one of his usual techno-laced soundtracks rather than fall back on a traditional orchestral track with sweeping strings for melodramatic effect. Yet, he does creating a score that just doesn't fit the visual content. On the other hand, the 5.1 sound effects in the film are exceptional creating one of the few enjoyable aspects of the production. Perhaps the best example of this is the scene when all the baby Godzilla's are hatching and you can hear their tiny roars all around you.Godzilla trashes more than buildings and cars, he devours the talents of some very fine actors on hack dialogue and poorly scripted plot lines. You get a sense that the script was written as they went along and most of the characters are just plain dumb and useless. Oddly, unlike other monster movies these useless characters aren't killed off, they just plod along with little to reveal or contribute to the story line.Of all the actors, only Jean Reno, a Frenchman with his own commando group, plays his part with the right balance of humor and action hero. Matthew Broderick is sadly out of his element and Hank Azaria spends most of the time running away from the great beast. Vicki Lewis from TV's 'NewsRadio' was undoubtedly brought in for comic relief, too bad they didn't give her anything funny to say. Meanwhile, Broderick's screen love-interest, Maria Pitillo is so obnoxious you are begging Godzilla to swoop down and gobble her up.Coming from the filmmakers behind Independence Day, you might have expected a lot more humor in this film, but unfortunately it's not here. Only a few sight gags and quickie one-liners ever hit their mark, leaving the movie is surprisingly empty, lacking a real sense of fun, despite its non-stop action.",Godzilla
570,jordan_m_miller,The best Godzilla movies up to its point,8,31 January 2017,"If you're trying to start watching all of the Godzilla movies, and make it this far, congratulations because you're an alcoholic. All Godzilla movies prior to this should just be considered points of reference to compare this one to, because the effects are so incredibly campy despite their historical impressiveness that they're just hard to watch. This one is the first one that feels modern enough to really enjoy it. You should watch at least a few of the Toho ones to see what Godzilla was, and then watch this one. It's better, despite its rainy flaws. The effects are worth watching, the monster behaves in the way you would expect Godzilla to behave. There wasn't enough mention of its nuclear origins and warnings, but the destruction is what you probably expected to see in at least one of the Toho films and did not get to see. The Toho films are like going to a museum, watching this movie is like going on a mildly outdated roller-coaster ride.",Godzilla

573,Patedwalters,"Wow, my expectations were low, but I can't believe this.",1,9 April 2008,"It had to happen eventually. 44 years after the original the Americans have to bastardize the Japanese classic. Well the results are here, and they are not looking good. The story is simple, all you really need to know is what you expect. Godzilla comes, he destroys, people fight, they die, eventually they defeat the creature. Well simplicity isn't the problem. Stupidity isn't either. Don't get me wrong, the film is stupid, but what do you expect from Roland Emmerich and his pals. I am not going to talk about how the people manage to lose a 400 foot tall creature several times, and I am not going to talk about how he changes sizes throughout the film. Stuff like this is to be expected. The Japanese movies commit atrocities just as bad as this.What I am here to talk about is the shere boredom induced by this movie that the Japanese movies never brought about. The film is over 2 hours long, and throughout the only mildly entertaining scenes are the first time the creature shows himself and the car chase that concludes the film. There is a certain visual wowness factor at watching Godzilla tear his way through the city, but it wears away quickly. It was more effective on me when I first saw it when it came out when I had just turned six. I mean seriously, this movie is over 2 hours long and Godzilla is only on screen for about 15 minutes. Something is wrong with that. I mean really, did they expect us to be entertained by the idiot humans and their pointless talking.The comedy is lame and so is everything else. We don't care about these humans and would rather Godzilla just kill them right of the bat. The movie also wastes a full 45 minutes dealing with Godzilla's children in a blatant Jurassic Park rip-off. It is yawn-inducing, as is most of the film. This film is a dull experience, from beginning to end, only occasionally resulting in some fun, but it is not nearly enough for a watch.",Godzilla

The graphics are good. The special effects may be the best ones that year. The movie is not too violent - makes it ideal for all ages. I has got laughs. The music is good too. Not judging it - but the movie is not for those who want to find some meaning. It is pure entertainment. It's called sci-fi but its only fiction not science. People go watch it. Its good entertainment.There is also a bit of politics. Emmerich was very careful not to stress on the nuclear tests as it could lead to unwanted attention on the sub-plots.Ted Elliott(story) & Terry Rossio (story) and Dean Devlin (story) & RolandEmmerich (story) Dean Devlin (screenplay) & Roland Emmerich (screenplay seem to hold to the Shakespeare method of making subplots for realism instead of Aristotlian principle of here and now. But they are careful not to get too much into the subplots to take away the electricity - good job! The acting was bad (flat). David Arnold won the BMI film music award for his music as he deserved. David Bloch and April Webster did a bad job finding the crew. The sound effects were good then again all technical aspects of the film were good. Over all it is a good movie.

Watch ""Jurassic Park"" or ""JP: the Lost World"" instead, this film does nothing but rip off these films among others (such as ""Alien"" and ""Hunt for Red October"").  The reason the entire film is in the rain and/or in the dark is to hide the poorly done not-so-special effects.Except for the noble attempts (despite the script) by Jean Reno and Hank Azaria, no one who starred in this trash should ever star in a movie again.

The bulk of the film is running from Godzilla, chasing Godzilla, tricking Godzilla, finding out we weren't really tricking Godzilla, and finally, not really caring what happens to Godzilla because we suddenly have Godzilla's bouncing babies to worry about. Most of the dialogue is clumsy, over-used or unnecessary. There are also some lovely sub-plots (the budding romance between Nick and Audrey, Audrey's struggle to get ahead in life, Nick unbelievably ANNOYING quest to get people to pronounce his last name right)  that do a great job of making the movie very cheesy.

Admittedly this is not one of those movies.Godzilla (1998) is a MOSTER flick.  I watched this film with little expectations and was delightfully surprised.  The movie brought me back to simpler times as a child when I was enthralled by moster movies.  Thanks to incredible computer graphics, the monster was sleeker, smarter and more agile than those of the older generation Godzilla movies.  Don't let these modern updates make you lose sight of a movie of this genre's basic plot and purpose: BIG BAD MONSTER THREATENS THE CITY- PEOPLE MUST KILL THE MONSTER LEAVING SUFFICIENT DOUBT OF ITS DEATH TO ALLOW FOR A RE-MATCH!So many people have cited a lack of a plot to this film.  I'd love to know what they are talking about.  Perhaps the plot was not intricate enough to satisfy them, but there certainly was one.If I may stray from this film for a moment consider that by today's standards, ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" wouldn't last past the first showing, yet I'm sure everyone reading this review has seen it and can picture the ""Gil Man"" in their minds eye.  Consider ""Frankenstein"" & ""The Mummy"", can't you just hear Boris Karloff's eerie voice saying ""ankh senama""?

Dr. Niko Tatopoulis (Matthew Broderick who is completely wasted in this role), an expert on radiation mutated life forms is called in to find out exactly what has been leaving this trail of huge 10 meter long footprints pointing at New York. Jean Reno plays Philippe Roache (an even more criminal waste of talent than Broderick's role), an agent of the French government who is trying to cover up the fact that it was the French who woke up this 100 meter tall lizard. This movie is great video fodder if you can get it at ""Two for the price of one"" night at your local video store, and it will test your Dolby system to the limit, but in the end it is funnier than it is frightening and the only reason why I could give it even three stars was Reno, who somehow manages to come off as a serious character in what is otherwise a very silly movie.",Godzilla

Unfortunately, the movie lacked pretty much EVERYTHING that made the old b-grade flicks worthwhile.  Godzilla '98 lacks atmosphere, character depth, acting skill (acting, period?), context, lastability and watchability.  In general, the film gives Godzilla a bad name.  Take my word for it, this is not what a regular Gojira movie looks like!  This is a new kind of B-grade movie -- The high budget, but unbelievably AWFUL b-grade.

Godzilla doesn't even look like Godzilla, he looks like a T-Rex, Godzilla isn't a T-Rex, he's a cross between two dinosaurs (the T-Rex and Stegasorause) In this film he doesn't even breath fire (the scene where he roars and the cars blow up is often mistaken as him breathing fire) Godzilla isn't to be taken out by the military, he's suppose to be attacked by another monster which defends the city. Over all, its OK and great for the action, but doesn't count as Godzilla. In the Film ""Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"" they mention that a giant monster sitting happened in New York City which was believed to be Godzilla, but really wasn't.

603,pumpkinhead_lance112,Size DOES Matter,10,19 December 2002,"It's been almost five years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you, when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't dissapointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people (and Godzilla fans) that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's ""Godzilla"".There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' atleast, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you, you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about, afterall.And what was wrong with the monster itself, Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in alot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being a laugh-fest at the theaters.What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original, that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts, but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got alot of attention, unfortunately, and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy this film.This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects, there's nothing quite like it.So take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as ""GODZILLA"".",Godzilla
604,baidurja_ray,Highly underrated......one of the top monster movies,8,23 January 2009,"I am happy that so many people have written here in favor of the movie although it was dumped by the critics. Frankly, as far as monster movies go, this one should rank among the top just because of the numerous subplots that it employs which sort of adds to the primary event. Also there is an elaborate attempt at the background behind the appearance of Godzilla and his activities, which is often missing in much more acclaimed films like Cloverfield (which I feel is a one-dimensional and grossly overrated movie). When you decide to watch a film like Godzilla, you are ready to suspend your disbelief but you hope that the events shown will be coherent and at the same time unexpected. That, in my opinion, this film achieves. Also, it is well acted, especially the ever reliable Jean Reno and a clever and vulnerable Matthew Broderick, ably supported by a cameo from Hank Azaria. It manages to be funny at the most unexpected situations, like the incredulous scene where the taxi is inside Godzilla's mouth. All in all, it deserves a 7, but an extra star in sympathy for the unfortunate critical response.",Godzilla
605,daniel-spence-561-665438,Good as a film in it's own right but as a Godzilla film...,4,21 October 2009,"Godzilla is a brilliant franchise and a remake was going to happen sooner are later, but what we got, well, It wasn't really Godzilla at all was it? I mean nobody was expecting the original man in a suit campy monster film that captured our hearts but we at least expected a monster that looked like Godzilla. They made some big changes, eg: Godzilla can't breathe fire, he is much smaller and is not indestructible. Up until a certain point in the film the movie remains true to the original film apart from one thing. In the original Godzilla Godzilla was created by American nuclear bombs. In this remake he is created by FRENCH NUCLEAR BOMBS. Just shows how willing America is to pass the blame from themselves to their arch rivals. And why the hell is Godzilla killed by the military! That ruins the film for everyone. Then it just completely strays away from the original. GODZILLA LAYS EGGS? THAT HATCH INTO VELOCIRAPTERS? Godzilla's offspring was just an excuse to rip off the rapter scene from Jurrasic park. Overall it is in some ways worth watching just, don't expect much!",Godzilla
606,TravelingExecutioner,Night of the Iguana,4,28 February 2010,"Wesconnosehny wrote one of the shortest, funniest reviews of this movie.I'm a huge monster/sci-fi fan, but after seeing 'Godzilla' in a theater on opening day, I felt oddly ambivalent. I didn't hate the movie, neither did I fall in love with it. The film was okay, but nothing special. As with 'Independence Day' and '2012,' 'Godzilla' was crammed with tankerloads of expertly-rendered CG imagery, but the film had very little magic, or heart (or soul). It didn't fire my imagination the way I expected it to. It didn't inspire the sense of awe I was looking for. Godzilla him(her?)self just looked like a bigger version of the pet iguana I used to have--nothing remarkable there--and the human characters were so flat and forgettable, it was hard to care what happened to any of them. A couple of lines of pithy dialogue don't make for engaging characters. It wasn't the fake-looking rubber shark that made 'Jaws' such a success (the special effects weren't that great), it was the script and the characters--things that had nothing to do with special effects.I read that Roland Emmerich insisted on having Godzilla be able to run really fast. Which, again, would be very accurate if Godzilla were an iguana. But to me, one of Godzilla's most compelling qualities is that he is ostensibly so massive and powerful, he's not afraid of anything and doesn't have to run from anybody. If Emmerich wants to push the 'realism' issue--which is a mistake--I would argue that no reptile, no matter how big or fast, would be able to survive or outmaneuver a squad of F-14 fighter jets. (The conundrum, of course, is that the bigger Godzilla is, the harder it would be for him to outmaneuver them.) 'Jurassic Park' set the CG bar pretty high. Since then, CG effects have become so polished and prolific (and overused?) that they're a dime a dozen. They've lost their 'wow' factor. (Except for 'Avatar' maybe.) Perhaps I've seen so many fantasy/sci-fi movies that I've gotten a little jaded, but it takes more than just a few ingenious digital effects to impress me these days. During the fighter-jet chase through the maze of Manhattan skyscrapers, I felt less like I was watching a movie than a giant first-person shooter game. If I'd wanted that, I'd have played with an X-box. (At least I'd have had the fun of doing some of the shooting.) I wasn't disappointed with 'Godzilla' because it was all that bad, but because it just wasn't all that good.",Godzilla
607,cotysmith08,Godzilla,9,13 March 2011,"If it be relevant, it be here. Pumpkin Swirl's Blog of Everything HomeAbout Me « Resident Evil ReviewResident Evil: Apocalypse Review » Godzilla (1998) ReviewIn 1998 Godzilla was being hyped as the biggest movie of all time. If you can't remember just imagine back in 2009 when Avatar was released and it was hyped beyond belief and predicted to break box office records. Zilla was predicted to do the exact same thing in 1998, but it eventually fell short and is considered a flop by most. I on the other hand think it's a damn good movie. It has everything I want in a big budget action movie. But that's REALLY why people hate it. Because they don't look at it as a summer movie. Instead they look at it like it's supposed to be an epic like Lord of the Rings, a drama featuring a giant lizard, or a big ole tub of cheese like the Japanese Godzilla movies. This means that there's two kinds of people who hate on the 90s Godzilla. Nerds who love the crappy Japan version and movie Nazis who hate everything. I mean seriously, what do you expect from a movie about a giant lizard who is running around New York City? I personally got what I wanted from it. A fun action packed movie that kept me entertained for a few hours.The picture about is another reason a lot pf people hated the new Godzilla. They hated him because he wasn't the bulky, slow moving, guy in a suit that is the original Godzilla. I personally think that Roland Emerich's Godzilla looks 10 times better than the thing below.90s Zilla looks much more vicious and bad ass than Tokyo Zilla. I will admit though that if I was a big fan of Japan Godzilla i'd be very disappointed at the American design. But I'd also realize that most Americans (myself included) wouldn't pay money for the pure cheese plots that Japanese Godzilla movies have. Yes, Zilla battling another monster could be done okay if the right director did it but I think they took the right route by making this one a movie about Godzilla attacking a city. If you watch the 90s cartoon they make Zilla Jr. exactly how you want him anyways. So don't bitch about the movie version. As if a giant lizard would emerge from the Hudson river and run around the city and the mayor would say ""ohhh lets make friends just in case another monster ever comes along.""Overall I thoughly enjoyed the movie for what it is. I enjoyed the bad acting, the story, and the very well done action scenes. This comes from a guy who really likes man vs beast movies though so IO'm probably just a little bit biased. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to sit down and have a good time watching a movie for a few hours. It's great for that.4/5The above review was taken from my blog so it might not make total sense, but I think it gets the jist of it.",Godzilla
608,abhimeddy,Childhood favourite monster,8,6 March 2011,"I saw Godzilla with my grandfather and my elder brother Abhinav in one of the cinemas in Shimla. It sure brings back some great childhood memories. With some brilliant special effects, good background score, nice performances and awesome cinematography it surely tops my list of favorite movies of all times. From the very beginning Godzilla was just meant to be enjoyed and not criticized. The action scenes are so well executed you can actually feel the chill run down your spine.Matthew Broderick as Dr. Niko does some commendable job as a geek main lead. The romance between Maria Pitillo as Audrey and Dr. Niko is not over the top but it surely shows nice chemistry between the two of them. Jean Reno as Philippe, a french agent and Hank Azaria as Victor, the cameraman (The scene where victor almost gets stepped down by Godzilla was nail biting) add humor to the story. The one liners are good but there's a lot of situational comedy in the action scenes which makes you laugh. In the end one feels a bit pity for the giant being, clearly showing that the presentation can alter the perception.With no obscenity or abusive language and no sex I would recommend Godzilla to all horror and action lover children and adult alike. The memory of this movie is etched in my memory forever. I am really unable to comprehend all the bad reviews that Godzilla got, but then to each his own.",Godzilla
609,SimbiAni,"Well, *I* thought it was brilliant...",10,5 June 2007,"Firstly, I'm one that never looked twice at the old GZ films, tho I'm sure they're good in their own ways, they just never caught me. But I did love Jurassic Park (first AND second, both awesome movies)- as well as Independence Day (what is up with other positive reviews for GZ'98 having to diss JP & iD4?)- and this movie has everything I loved about them combined. I don't see movies just for ""special effects"", I see them for good adventures and snarky humour. If you're looking for the same, this movie shouldn't disappoint. I loved the casting AND the writing- all of the characters are memorable AND quotable (same writers as the Pirates movies!). I remember, when I went to see JP2 in 1997, there was a teaser for GZ'98 during the trailers. It was the scene where GZ's foot comes down on the T-Rex display in the museum (tho that later turns out to be a deleted scene). From that moment I was excited to see it- which I did the next summer on the bigscreen. I've loved it ever since. Matthew Broderick and Hank Azaria and Jean Reno are just great to have along in this adventure. It's one of those movies that I can watch whenever, and get hooked for the entire ride all over again, every time. Another memory is when it was on Pay-Per-View around late '98, sometimes I'd watch / listen to it in scribblevision (if you had cable back then, you might know what I mean). I got the video as soon as it came out. And then the DVD. When I started vidding in 2005, I made a vid for it, which you can see at my YouTube page (SimbiAni), it's titled ""Feel The Rain"". The reason I finally got around to leaving a comment for it here at IMDb, is because it is on TV right now and it occurred to me to check its page here, and after seeing the unfortunate low user ratings... decided might as well. It seems these days (from various movie boards) the majority of ""average ppl as movie critics"" can't make up their mind for what they want in a movie- either there is a somewhat or complete lack of plot or too much story to understand what is going on. Thankfully, I'm neither. If I had to choose a fave scene, it is definitely the taxi chase thru the city and onto the bridge. Likewise, if I had to choose a favorite quote (tho there are SO many!), it would have to be also from the bridge scene- Victor: ""Oh you gotta be kidding me, man! We're in his MOUTH! We're iN his MOUTH!"" *crunching* ""You're going the wrong way, man! You're GOiNG the WRONG WAY!"" Phillipe: ""Will you shut up now?!"" Just awesome!",Godzilla
610,cayser-tseo,Surprisingly poor,4,24 June 2012,"OMFG! I mean, you cannot really expect the worst of the grandmaster of tard-fiction, but this one pretty much nailed it. I mean, the book is so ridiculously bad in every 3rd sentence of dialogue and non-dialogue. Why TF is an unknown worm-expert is called to a ""so-called"" Godzilla Task Force and every other people in this ""task force"" seem so incredibly incompetent. I mean, even the chaos mathematician in Jurassic Park played by Jeff Goldblum expressed more applyable knowledge than Matthew Broderick in this movie. And he is not even a bad actor. So it's the playwright's and director's fault all the way.And before the book, there is the idea, the concept. The idea, the concept to start is so ridiculous: why TF would a gigantic lizard voyage from Japan through the Pacific Ocean, then the Atlantic Ocean, only to land exactly in Manhattan, propably the most populated area in the world, to build its nest? Is LA not sufficient enough? I mean: I feel personally offended by this ""twist of drama"".The latter half of the film I didn't watch because the first half was an insult. To me. The audience.

If it was renamed something else (or renamed 'Zilla' to 'keep' it in the Godzilla Movie Family) then this movie wouldn't be as hated. But still if you are able to push the flaws somewhere else and tell your brain that this isn't a Godzilla movie, then I encourage you to watch this movie.",Godzilla

But I think it is a little bit harsh, and the reviews I've read that pan this film seem to take the movie out of context. For what it is, Godzilla does a relatively good job.It it's not supposed to be a great character study. It's not supposed to be high drama - it is a special effects movie, and an action movie. For someone who was quite young when it came out would be entertained by its whole ""cool giant lizard"" aspect, and that's what matters. The film sets out to entertain, and, for the most part, it does. The special effects are good, the acting satisfactory, and the dialogue passable. Come on, it's not that bad!

The story isn't great, the characters are silly and a male Godzilla being able to vanish in a city to lay his eggs. Yeah. I get you. Its very silly.But that is what makes it great! Its not trying to be identical to Japanese Godzilla. This one isn't a laser beam breath GOD! It is simply a animal trying to find a place to nurture it's offspring. The people in the city will serve as snack for the kids!The actors are aware their roles are silly and it shows. Only a couple of them had poor acting. They are all slightly silly and goofy and even likable and memorable.Godzilla is pretty likable himself! Hes not going after humans as a food source. He eats fish! And lots of fish! If you get under his feet...well that's a shame but he wont target you(unless you murder his children!). He can take damage, he flees and fights for his life. He mourns and wants revenge for his lost children and walks in a trap doing so.All in all. Its a silly movie with quite a bit of action and you get to see the monster a lot! unlike most of todays movies.

I don't mean a bulky man-in-a-suite looking Godzilla but a sleeker version of the 90s version of Godzilla. But other then the CGI-zilla, I have no problems with the rest of the movie.

619,Mychael,Just ridiculous,2,10 September 1998,"I was really amazed: Roland Emmerich dared to actually turn Godzilla into the most ridiculous rip-off of ""Jurassic Park"". And a poor man's Jurassic Park it became. We see T-Rex in New York, for 2 hours. If the special effects would have improved compared to the original there would have been at least a minor reason to see this trash. But they didn't improve. In fact , they are much inferior - that's probably the reason why 90 % of the CGI effects take place in darkness and pouring rain. To conceal their unrealistic looks. But then again, who would complain about the effects if the film was thrilling and fun ? We have an extremely weak script here that bores us with cardboard characters who keep saying the same old unoriginal lines over and over. It's really hard to keep yourself from thinking ""I could have written this when I was 10"". At the premiere I attended in Germany, about 1/4 of the audience left the cinema prior to the ending.

Usually there would be nothing amazing about it we've all seen one before right? on T.V. in a documentary or in Sea World. However in that movie we were not given a glimpse of the shark until 3/4 of the way through, just the carnage it left behind...which was what made it so terrifying.In this movie a half an hour hasn't gone by and this totally unoriginal unscary monster shows up and the audience had nothing to look forward to.If there was rating lower than 1 on the imdb I would give it -15.",Godzilla

Godzilla must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of all, it's a nitpickers' heaven; the script is chock-full of illogical skips and jumps, nonsensical ideas and just completely stupid in-duh-viduals. The photography looks like a TV -show, the actors (in the broadest sense of the word) have been left completely without direction and despite the loud action, the movie's boring you to tears in less than an hour. When the movie had been running for 75 minutes, a friend of mine leaned over and whispered ""This has to end soon. I can't take much more of this"", to which I replied ""only an hour more to go"". He got up, collected his jacket and left. I used to think that Matthew Broderick was a passable actor. Well, no more. While he was horribly bad, it was nothing compared to the female lead. In one scene, she is sitting on a bed, sobbing. I couldn't tell whether she was supposed to be faking it and trying to get some sympathy from the other person in the room, or whether she was actually trying (and failing miserably) to portray a woman crying. Even the most preposterous faults in the script are too numerous to go into here, just go and find a nitpicker's website and laugh yourself silly. I'm going to see the movie again, this time armed with a print-out of the script's faults and ready to ruin the movie for everyone by pointing out the faults in a loud voice.

How'd it KNOW about cities in the first place?), but at least there's a reason.All of the negative things that have been said about this movie thus far have been some of the things the older versions had been praised for. And while there are obvious rip-offs of other movies, remember these are the same makers of Independence Day, a film that didn't have one original idea, but is a collection of other science fiction movies. This is apparently the producer's method of making movies. People can see this as ripping off -- negative -- or see it as an homage to other great films -- positive.I'll buy this movie.

The effects in this film were somewhat satisfying and engaging, but the main characters (with the exception of Hank Azaria's character) ruined most of the scenes.Audrey, the ""love interest"" for Matthew Broderick's role, is perhaps one of most irritating female characters I've ever seen on film - shallow, stupid, totally lacking in judgment, and she runs like ""Gloria"" from Body Double; a film not known for its satisfying female characters.What's perhaps most sad, except for the fact that she miraculously manages to triumph (sort of), is that the director tried to make Audrey lovable and appealing to the audience, as a vulnerable, sweet, yet misguided woman, despite her effective ability to alienate the interest and care of most female AND male audience members. How could they not see their blunder and correct it by feeding Audrey to Godzilla at the end? I have never been to a movie wherein I eagerly joined audience members chanting ""EAT HER!"" We were disappointed.And why, I wonder, did they think it was a good idea to name 4 or 5 of the French characters ""Jean-_____""?A recommendation to any aspiring directors: make sure the annoying characters get eaten, and if you really insist on naming 80% of your French characters Jean-something, at least have them laugh at themselves for it IN the movie - don't just hope people will notice and think its funny, because they won't.",Godzilla
640,Cuchulainn-2,What I expected is what I got,10,6 February 2000,"I scored Godzilla 10 out of 10 and let me tell you, why:First, this is a monsterfilm and what I want from a monsterfilm is a monster and maybe some stupid humans it squeezes. And we've got it.Second, this is a spectacular film and what I want from a spectacular film is a bunch of monumental scenes made with the latest technics (CGI here), which stick me to the seat. And Godzilla's got lots of them.I don't know, why do people watch a movie, if they don't like its style in advance and write later stupid reviews comparing the film to completely different ones or expecting things, which are absolutely not the part of that type of movie (like here criticizing the actors).So if you like spectacular monsterfilms, Godzilla is your film!

The big lizard that saved Tokyo more than once when the people were in trouble. So why not has Godzilla suddenly become the bad guy. I just don't get it. It's probably the army's habit of treating anything they don't understand as a national threat and want to destroy it.Highlights of the movie were the street chases through Manhattan. You got the army throwing everything they got at Godzilla and not even a scratch, they even lost some of their own men and weapons. And they went and did it again!

The actress playing Audrey is playing the role like she was directed, I think, because she is the perfect foil to Matthew Broderick's character... and what a character - instead of the usual steely-eyed macho man, we have a mild-mannered, serious guy who studies worms ;> It's all a heck of a lot of great fun, really intelligent, really funny, the requisite amount of explosions, I guess... even the monster has personality.

When I first watched it on big screen in 1998 I liked it most, but after too many years I tried to look at it again and I was just stucked at it. for 1998 the vfx is amazing. You can still watch it without being distracted. Just very few carefull eyes can catch something.Director Emmerich established a massive production and in my opinion He managed it highly succesfully. Music is huge orchestral composition which tailor-made for the movie. Somebody found the cast a little goofy at times but it isn't a problem for me, maybe I don't expect it to be a scary movie or some horror stuff, I've always enjoyed godzilla with some comedy in it.Sound effects are also great. and lastly Stages are very well-designed. when I compose this article it's imdb rating was 5.4 which is a total nonsense.

Godzilla purist's may be disappointed with the new and improved Lizard King, but I say to bad. Look at it this way it just may force Japan's movie makers to try and up the ante if they ever decide to resurrect their boy. I give the animators of this movie an ""A+"" grade for the seemingly real lifelike depiction of their monster. He beats the pants of the original muppet wanna be puppet reptile.

The movie had so much potential to become a great movie. Yet... IT Didn't!!! Instead, what we have is poor acting and very long boring moments in between every battle. The only actors I enjoyed were Hank Azaria and Jean Reno. The whole thing with the nest was definitely an interesting point in the story and the action during that time was great, and then when Godzilla came back and saw his children dead was a heartfelt scene where you could sympathize with the creature.

655,nar-11,And settle for less? I think not.,2,28 December 2007,"First off, you'll read lots of critiques ranging from people who are purists of the Gojira franchise to those with less expectations for a monster movie. I've read some reviews here that sound frustrated about purists not being satisfied. They want them to accept the movie for what it was. A special effects laden movie and nothing more.Well.. I'm going to say one word followed by reason. ""NO""Gojira fans deserve much better for a movie that claimed itself to be the revolution of Godzilla just because of its use of amazing CGI.This movie bombed. Pure and simple. It sucked and you will have more agree to that than the otherwise. The film director took a beloved creature which was created in Japan based off of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Radioactive residue turning a lizard into a mutant giant monster.The sole idea here, was that the monster was basically created by our stupidity with warfare activities that took place a long time ago. Something that emerged from our wrong doings. A giant monster karma of a problem to put it in short words. This monster wasn't evil. But it had the instincts of an enraged creature seeking exploration of its surroundings and clashing with humans for the second time.The film, Godzilla 1985 (Gojira 1984 in japans aka Gojira Returns), pretty much successfully set that idea and created a very respected, inspiring and intense movie that was ahead of its own time. The 80s.This new American Godzilla film however, changed and denied 80% of the original creator's intention and turned our beloved monster into gargantuan mush.And for those who are saying ""who cares, its just a monster movie"", you're a disgrace to the G-fan base whether you care so or not. Therefore your sub-standard ideals about movie quality no longer hold weight to me.I'm the kind of person that pushes a job until it cant be pushed no more. I'm all about top notch quality. Not just visual quality, but EVERYTHING quality. Story had to be much better than this nonsense. It could have been good. Really good. But it really wasn't. It just wasn't. The special effects, amazing in its own respect to the artists behind them, did not aid the movies direction. The major disrespectful approach to change an iconic monster into a chicken legged giant iguana, really let a lot of fans down and with good reason as that thing just wasn't God'fricken'zilla.However... had the film been renamed to its actual now fan labeled name ""Zilla"", I would have not had been received as badly. Dropping any expectations and possibly even appreciating this movie only as a second rate monster movie. Which would probably have helped it in terms of reputation.And yes, I do understand that this monster is no longer called Godzilla in Japan either. It is now known ONLY as ""Zilla"" by the Japanese. It was so iffy, they couldn't take in what the American bought license did to their beloved monster. I mean, let's be honest. When the news first leaked out about an American release of Godzilla, we were all hyped up expecting that same powerful iconic nostalgic feeling we got in the 80's when Godzilla first hit Hollywood theaters. IT WAS HUGE NEWS!Thats why many including I, feel this movie was a let down. Quality is everything. As a creator myself, I live by those words. If you adapt to low quality or moderate quality and tell yourself ""it was good""... then you will never taste the fruit of a truly great quality production. And Im not going to discuss the Japanese G movies as those were understandably being made on low budgets. What do you expect with little money. :/ But for an American film, I really expected something that would have embedded itself in my memories as well as the memories of our kids today. Sort of like what Godzilla 1985 was back then.Alas, not this time. My chime. And Im sticking to it.",Godzilla
656,kcecilrgs,I want my hour and a half back,1,23 April 2012,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can enjoy stupid movies when they are done well The Day After Tomorrow and Waterworld to name two, but this movie was a total waste of time. Between the technical inaccuracies, the physical impossibilities, and the improbable actions of the characters, I found myself the entire time thinking (and even speaking to myself) ""this is a really bad movie, why am I still watching this"".To be brutally honest, I prefer the old Japanese movies with a guy in a suit stepping on models. At least then the cheese is consistent.What are my complaints? I don't want to give anything away so as to be a spoiler, but let's just say the actions of the military personnel, the effect of the munitions, and the reactions of Godzilla are so ridiculous at one point I thought to myself, ""the writers obviously didn't spend any time on research."" And the dramatic pauses? Talk about ridiculous. ""I'm about to be eaten, I'm just going to stand here and look curious."" ""I'm about to fall in a hole, I'm just going to stand and look dramatic.""

Not that Godzilla could ever be Cloverfield; Godzilla requires back story and context whereas Cloverfield completely avoids both, but when it comes to sheer monster butt kicking, Cloverfield shows Roland Emmerich how it SHOULD have been done. WOW, did his version of ""Godzilla"" SUCK.I'm still mad about it... nearly 10 years later and I can still remember the abject disappointment I felt walking out of that theater. I was a Godzilla fan since I was probably 6. Watched the cartoon every Saturday morning (Godzookie!). Started getting into the TOHO movies when I was a teenager, then, THIS piece of crap hits. The CGI wasn't bad for it's time, but, like pretty much every Emmerich movie, the script and plot were ATROCIOUS. Too bad he didn't have the sense that J.J. Abrams has; make an awesome 35 story monster, then get the hell out of the way. Instead we got dialogue like this:NICKYou just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.AUDREYThat was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.NICKMost people don't.AUDREYI'm sorry you feel that way.Audrey turns and walks away. Nick regrets his behavior and calls after her.NICKWait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea? OH GOD... I think I'm going to get sick all over again...

It really makes you think about what the world would be like if an incident such as this were to actually happen. How would our present-day government and military officials handle a situation of such gigantic proportions! Would they even believe that such a creature actually exists or would they prefer to keep everything hush-hush until it's too late?

About the acting part, not bad at al, the actors haven't got the best part in this movie but they are about average. I do like the humor in the movie.

661,hubble99,This is how an action movie must be (almost),9,9 September 2002,"Emmerich must have thought, bigger is better ! Well in this movie it is. T-rex is for kids, Godzilla is here. If there was an Oscar to be given for the best CGI character, Godzilla would definitely have won it. An action movie should be about explosions,(gun)fights, pursuits and most importantly, a seemingly invincible hero. A plot or a difficult story just distracts you. (thats why they invented drama) This movie has it all, it is a thrill-ride that keeps you on the edge of your couch from the beginning to the end. Put your home theater set to the max and feel the movie almost like he is ravaging your own living room. The hero in this movie is of course Godzilla himself and in the end I really felt sorry for him. After all, he is not evil, he is just trying to survive. Unfortunately Emmerich made two mistakes: the first was not to erase the the whole whining role of Audrey Timmonds from the script, and the second was the casting of Broderick and Pitillo. Maria Pitillo rivals with Tea Leoni for the most annoying actress to walk the face of the earth. But hey, thats just a small part of this movie.

However, despite being released after a period of two parts of Jurassic Park, which had pretty good skills in creating dinosaurs like real life, then techniques in Gozilla still not perfect. I'm just not happy about this aspect, Gozilla somewhat rigid, less is realistic to make films, giving viewers can still feel something is not true in the Gozilla.

The acting was suitable for a movie that focuses on a big monster. I just really liked the way Emmerich takes the size of this thing and makes us think about what it could do with a city like New York. It looks expensive and some funny lines here and there were to be found as well. So I really don't understand why it didn't do as expected because I thought that most of the American Audience would ask for movies like Godzilla, Independence Day and others.

666,MisterSmiley,This is a critical review on the 1998 Godzilla remake directed by Roland Emmerich.,4,3 May 2015,"In 1954, the film ""Gojira"" was released and became an instant classic spawning numerous sequels some of which became classics too. The 1998 American remake, however, just isn't that.Keep in mind that this is a review from my critic side and not my fan side.The story centers around a giant reptilian monster that was created by nuclear tests in French Polynesia. After attacking a Japanese cargo ship carrying fish in the Pacific Ocean, the creature somehow swims towards New York City of all places to make a nest. Now, it's up to Nick Tatopoulos and his friends to stop the monster.The story as you just read is just a typical monster plot, and the writers try way too hard to make this flick interesting by including ""realistic science"". What do I mean by this? Well, Godzilla is a mutated lizard specifically a marine iguana, but he doesn't look anything like the lizard he originally was. Another example is when the film explains that the monster is asexual which is absolutely absurd because a mutation caused by nuclear bombs does not include being asexual. I know about ""suspension of disbelief"", but there's only so much the audience can believe. If having ridiculous science talk isn't bad enough, ""Godzilla"" down-right steals scenes from ""Jurassic Park"" that this should have been called ""Jurassic Park 3"" or ""Jurassic Park- Giant Dino"".The characters are either bland, hateful, forgettable. The main character is Nick Tatopoulos, played by Matthew Broderick, who is the clichéd boring, dorky, socially awkward scientist who never are good main leads. I understand that Emmerich wants to make heroes from normal people, but they have to be interesting and/or likable. Tatopoulos is not likable. In fact, I don't know a thing about him. He's a bore, but what's worse than a boring character? A hateful character. The romantic interest Audrey Timmonds, played by Maria Pitillo, is a despicable, selfish character who I wanted Godzilla to eat so badly. Here an example on how she's hateful: She is talking to her New York stereotypical friend about her relationship with Nick, and her friend asks her how long they dated. Audrey said about 3 or 4 years, and this is what her friend said, ""Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry you."" Then, Audrey says, ""That's the thing. He did."" There's nothing more we learn about their relationship expect that they get back together in the end. So, she wanted him to ask her but declined when he did. Why should I care about her? Also, she steals top secret information from Nick's tent when she knows she's not supposed to, and it was for her career as a news reporter. Additionally, after putting the information on the news, we see her crying while watching the news, but she's not crying because of what she did- we know this because we see her give a horribly acted and soulless apology to Nick prior- but because her report was stolen by her boss. What a selfish broad. The other characters aren't all that memorable outside the fact that they're just New York or French stereotypes giving us some tasteless stereotypical dialogue and jokes.Despite the poorly written characters, the actors do a decent job playing them. There's just nothing else to say about the acting. They did what they could and did okay.That is expect for Maria Pitillo who was just awful.The special effects when looked at a modern aspect are bad, but in the context of 1998, they're from okay especially when you compare the effects of ""Godzilla"" to the film that it strongly plagiarizes, ""Jurassic Park"". One scene from ""Godzilla"" that might have looked good in '98 but looks really bad today is the footstep scene shown in all of the trailers and commercials where Godzilla's foot slams down and raises back up. However, some effects still look really good which include any particle effects, and, my favorite shot, when Godzilla jumps over the bridge to dive into the Hudson River. That shot still looks really impressive.Now, let's talk about the monster Godzilla. I will not be judging this creature to the original, but instead on how he stands on his own which is pathetic. One of the main problems with him is that he's not scary or endearing. If you're going to do a monster film, you have to do one or the other, and this monster fails trying to do either one. He's not enduring because you don't see any reason why we the audience should care about him, and he's not scary because not only does he not look scary, he's a coward and a wimp. The only reason he stays alive as much as he does in the film is because the military sucks at hitting him. Additionally, we never see him showing why he's a force to be reckoned with. He's constantly running away. Bottom line, this is one of the worst monsters put on film.Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a bad film, but there are a few good things in it. Outside of the monster and Audrey, nothing in the film can be heavily criticized or hated for. This is one of those movies where if you ""turn off"" your brain and just put it on to kill some time, this film would be fine to put on, or if you want to watch a movie but don't care what it is, ""Godzilla"" would be alright to watch. Now, I can't hate on this film too much because there is a good or even great monster film in here but just not fully realized, and ""The Word to Sum It"" best explains it best.The Word to Sum It: stale. This flick feels that everything was rushed and not fleshed out.IMDb Rating: 4/10 Personal Rating: 2/5 Rotten Tomatoes Rating: 2.5/5",Godzilla

I still don't know how this DVD got in my collection but it's going out with the trash in the morning.Can someone tell me where I can be reimbursed? I hate to fill our landfills with even more trash. I think...peace ya'll GODZILLA",Godzilla

671,kilili,Spielberg must have thrown up,3,26 August 2013,"Anyone remember the trailer for Godzilla ? Godzilla's foot smashes a T-Rex skeleton on exhibition in a museum. This was at a time when we weren't quite sure if Roland Emmerich had talent. ID4 was cheesy but no doubt had its moments. 15 years later we know for sure that he is one of the worst directors ever to have made it to Hollywood. Flicking through his works that were yet to come and insult our intelligence, I am now sure that Emmerich is the one big (not great!) Hollywood director to even make Michael Bay look ""maybe not quite as bad"". Comparing Godzilla to Jurassic Park fits quite nicely as both film makers had the ambition of creating a fun and exciting roller-coaster ride of a film. But JP was about ideas. It had some profundity to it where Godzilla was merely about size and discarded the actual appeal of the original. Spielberg was able to create suspense and tension. In JP he refined it to perfection. The T Rex was beautifully designed and somewhat had the weight of a believable entity. Godzilla's design was ridiculously puberty-boyish, had no weight, didn't scare. The set pieces were awful. The logic gaps were a disgrace. Matthew Broderick was a bad cast. The reporter's behavior was as non-sequitur as that of a schizophrenic idiot. And then the rain... Godzilla's dead.. Broderick waddles up to its carcass and now we seem to be supposed to feel sorry for this misunderstood creature.. I mean it just wanted to destroy the city and kill us all :( I can't understand how anyone could ever like or even appreciate this peace of cinematic horse.. manure. I hate the fact that I watched it all the way through. I'll never be able to get that time back.. ever.Conclusion: Jurassic Park relates to Godzilla like Spielberg relates to Emmerich or like Marilyn Monroe relates to Paris Hilton or like Dolphins relate to Leeches. :)",Godzilla
672,oliboas,The best movie ever,10,12 September 2004,"I loved this movie. It's so cool. Can't get enough!!!! The actors are so excellent, giving life for the characters. The director knows to do destructions scenes, using the famous buildings of N.Y. I hope that have a sequel, because it deserves! Maria is so fantastic in this movie and Matthew Broderick too. Hank is the funny soul of this movie.Jean Reno shows that he is an excellent action actor. The story shows to the new generation what is Godzilla. This is one of the best Hollywood's movie!!",Godzilla

676,austinrobertjohnson1,Size Matters,7,5 February 2020,"The overall view of This movie by film critics and Godzilla purists is that it is bad. Very bad. It sounds like this movie was almost unwatchable by the world. But to a twelve year old boy with no idea about previous Godzilla films living in the middle of upstate NY in 1998, this film was great! Seeing this in theaters was a fun experience as a kid. Pretty sure since they made an animated series and plenty of Godzilla toys and figures and merchandise that this movie was made for kids like me. As an adult rewatching I can see the things that people criticize about the film but that just makes it funny. Like understanding an adult joke in a kids movie once you're older. Super inappropriate but another sign of how times have changed. I would definitely recommend this movie for for older kids and adults looking for a laugh or to unwind. I would not recommend this to people studying film or people who feel strongly about the lore of Godzilla.",Godzilla
677,shawn_kong_303,wonderful and educational,10,1 December 2004,"this is a nice movie,why do certain people have to keep lambasting it? in this movie,godzilla proves her agility by dodging many helicopters and turning the tables by destroying them one by one effortlessly.This film also makes me realize how overly selfish human beings are as they only are concerned about protecting their own interests and mistaking godzilla in this movie for some monster.Hello,those guys have got it totally wrong!this is just a giant iguana,an animal that is trying to get along in the human world.Godzilla in this movie,in my point of view,is living according to the laws of nature.She sought food,shelter and a nesting place.The motherly love and sorrow that was in godzilla was felt strongly when she was seen weeping over her dead babies and nuzzling their remains.Just look at how she nourished her 200 odd children with enough food and shelter.Furthermore,it really grieves me to see godzilla being killed at the end of the movie in such a ruthless manner when she barely recovered from the trauma of losing her loved ones.We,as the most intelligent and also the dominant species on Earth,should use our knowledge and try to befriend this giant iguana like how zoo trainers befriend animals,not kill whatever species that we consider inferior or threatening just because of their looks.This is plain murder!Anyway for the F-18 pilots in this movie,shame on them for using military armaments against a defenceless lady like godzilla who just witnessed her kids' funeral!Although this is only a movie,sensible people should be able to read between the lines in this senseless bicker of Man with a potentially harmless creature.Anyway,Godzilla rawks!",Godzilla
678,jfrilando,What's the problem? This is a good monster movie. (SPOILERS!),8,17 January 2020,"Okay, I understand the Godzilla purists who enshrine Ishuri Honda's masterpiece of post world war two commentary of the effects of the first atomic bombs dropped on Japan. The 1954 film is a classic in film history that started a genre that continues today. Some of the sequels also merit that respect, most recently, Shin Godzilla which tackles the problems of government bureaucracy during a crisis.Perhaps the biggest mistake that Centroplis Pictures made with this film was paying the millions of dollars that they did to Toho Limited in order to use the Godzilla name. They could have made it a remake of 1953's Warner Brothers classic, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms which was released a year prior to Godzilla and inspired Toho to make a box office success, not just a post war statement.Just like you know what you're in for with a Michael Bay film, the same can be said with director Roland Emerich and producer Dean Devlin who reimagined The War of the Worlds with their first blockbuster, Independence Day. This is a fun popcorn movie with a great cast including Mathew Broderick, Hank Azeria and Jean Reno whose comedic timing is pretty darn good considering the monsters that wreck havoc on New York City. Emmerich continues to destroy landmarks in his trademark fashion including the Fulton Fish Market, the Brooklyn Bridge and Madison Square Garden.Once again Godzilla is the consequence of nuclear testing during the 1950s but not American. France's nuclear testing has resulted in the monster this time and Jean Reno leads an undercover JSOC team to stop the beast. The French inclusion provides some wonderful humor from American coffee and donuts to Reno imitating Elvis when getting past American military security. Another fun thing that you might miss is that everyone in Reno's command first name is Jean except Reno, whose name is Phillipe.Matthew Broderick brings his charisma similar to his performances in Ferris Bueller, Wargames and Biloxi Blues as a scientist who is researching the growth of earthworms as the result of nuclear contamination when he is drafted to help in the investigation of a mysterious radioactive creature that is sinking ships. He pulls off the role with humour, intelligence and wonder. Hank Azaria is hilarious as Animal, a New York news station cameraman who is more afraid of his wife, played by Arribella Field than he is of Godzilla. Director Emmerich also takes a major jab at film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert who blasted his first disaster epic, ID4, one of the first summer mega blockbusters. The characters of Mayor Ebert and his aide Gene are funny enough but even more so when you know why they are portrayed. Perhaps the weakest point of the film is the love connection between Broderick and his long lost love Audrey who is an aspiring television reporter played by Maria Patillo but it's not awful and I don't watch movies like this for deep romantic moments anyway.
Just like the original this Godzilla is a destructive monster. He/she is not the protector of man or the wonderful friend of little children and he/she brings a destructive potential that, if brought to fruition, could devastate the Americas.If it makes you feel better don't call this Godzilla even though it evidently followed the strict criteria that Toho demanded for a movie using the Godzilla name. The Monsterverse that brought us the last 2 American Godzilla movies also had to comply with distinct Toho Limited rules. Instead get some popcorn, sit down turn up the volume and enjoy a reality good, very humorous Roland Emmerich/Dean Devlin blow a lot of stuff monster movie.",Godzilla
679,sushanthotu,Are you guys kidding?,9,26 November 2013,"Showed this movie to my girlfriend who has never seen any Jurassic Park/Dinosaur movies ever and she couldn't believe this movie was made in 1998. Her unbiased opinion was that she found the movie to be pretty good. I Appreciate the work that has been put in to make the creatures look so real, the SFX were stunning and the storyline wasn't half bad either. Too bad there wasn't an official sequel to it but a classic in my book, dare I say it better than Jurassic Park? Nevertheless, see this movie regardless of the critics and for your love of dinosaurs. I rate this movie 9/10 on the bases of SFX alone.",Godzilla
680,shiv-yorker,Godzilla - has it's moments and flaws as well,6,9 December 2013,"This is one movie which got more criticism than it's really deserved. I agree, it has some flaws, but don't forget that it's a popcorn movie. If you want to be educated by watching a movie, then go somewhere else. All Emmerich's movies meant for entertainment, and they are not for intellectuals and perfectionists. As an average movie-goer, I have felt entertained though having some problem with its run-time. I have seen people comparing this with some Japanese Godzilla movies, and making negative remarks. Honestly, i feel that Japanese Godzilla movies look pathetic, and make no-sense at all. Technically, American Godzilla is far superior to them. Even, i don't have a problem with characters; you can see these kinds of things in every superhero/sci-fi/disaster movies. Don't expect every movie to be a Jurassic park; avatar, the dark knight etc. just enjoy these kinds of movies over a weekend with your family.",Godzilla
681,beltram-1,Great action movie,10,14 March 2005,"I can't think of another movie with more non stop action than this movie. I came in expecting great action and special affects and it actually exceeded my expectations. Yes the acting was terrible, but who actually came in to this looking for great performances. It's just a great action movie to sit back and enjoy. It's also the best movie to watch with surround sound. Other than Michael Bay flicks this has to be the best way to test out your sound. I've actually gotten complaints whenever I watch this to turn it down but how can you when your watching an Emmerich movie. Of all of his movies this one is my favorite. I really wish this movie had done better so they'd make another one but I don't think its going to happen.",Godzilla

I have little memory of it after that, but boy, it had a SUPERB soundtrack! It was the talk of the town Now that i'm watching it for the 2nd time, wow did it blow my mind! 2 words, AWE-SOME!!!! The giant iguana was made more realistic than some of the King Kong's (2006), Spiderman's or Harry Potter's shots. It was 1998, 8 yrs ago!! & roland Emmerich, man, he does some wonders sometimes. Just take a look at ID4, Day after Tomorrow, & i'm a big fan of expensive CGI effects! My only complaint would be, there should be *at least* an A-list actor in a big-budgeted movie. I think that contributes partially to a b.o success, more or less",Godzilla

It may be a decent monster movie, but not a Godzilla movie. It misses VERY IMPORTANT trademarks.E.g. the monster doesn't really breath atomic fire. Where are the Stegosaurus spikes? The worst thing is that it's getting killed by the military. That never happened in any of the movies before. Godzilla is pretty much immortal. Only another Monster has a chance against Godzilla.It's not a complaint about the plot or the CG-effects in General. This movie just does not have the Godzilla feeling. The 2014 version did a way better job.If the movie wasn't ""Godzilla in the name only"" it would have been decent.",Godzilla
685,nksworld,The Perfect Action Godzilla Movie For Its Time,10,8 October 2014,"I wonder why so many people did not give this movie its proper merit in terms of some great Special Effects, Action, the Monster Godzilla itself and the good acting by Matthew Broderick and supportive casts. When I watched this movie in 1998, I watched it as a standalone Godzilla movie, not relating it to the Godzilla comic books or cartoons... and to my surprised it was great for its year of release, surpassing the special effects i expected to see.When I watched new Godzilla 2014 movie, it was as if I'm watching a cartoon movie again at the cine. And... and.. Godzilla was just the supporting cast in the new movie lol :P At least I expected 45 min of Godzilla out of a 1hr45 min. I did not see a full close view of Godzilla itself.Godzilla 98 seems way higher quality special effects and better disaster movie than the 2014 movie.In terms of entertainment I give it an easy 9.5/10",Godzilla
686,Exhumed_One,"""The French save the day, and we don't like that"".",7,7 June 2005,"That's the only reason. The French save the world. That's the only reason almost all people - in USA, I must say - hate this movie.In despite of the people searching for sci-fi in a movie named ""Godzilla"", of the fans of the Japanese movies (Heavens!), of all the past times the duo Emmerich-Devlin had ruined a not-bad-but-remake-of-an-old-idea (i.e. almost all their past movies) this one it's not so bad, guys. But that is not the point. It's about the ""masterpiece"" of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich.The aforementioned duo have spent last years delighting us with some remakes and the like of sci-fi films or ideas (Years ago a young jury at a Cinema Festival for the young here in my country voted ""Joey"" as best movie, while the real jury voted, more accordingly, ""My Life as a Dog"". If you want to know for sure Emmerich's opinion about his favorite film, pay attention to the Star Wars DVD Trilogy extras(1)).The first real ""success"" of the duo was ""Stargate"", which is nothing but ""Flash Gordon"" with the Army around. An almost decent movie, not much expensive (by Hollywood standards) and with a script capable of solve the whole crisis in a hurry that would make George Lucas face turn red in envy. We arrive, we discover this Egyptian demigod (Ra!), we killed him and destroy his superior technology and his powerful pyramid-vessel, thanks for everything, next time will stay a bit longer. Pathetic (the TV series is terribly boring. Sorry).And then came the martians (whatever). And this, my friends, is your idea of a good spectacle. In that time was fun to see the White House blowing up in a zillion fragments, and your sympathetic army saving the entire world by destroying a whole technologically superior civilization (I'm sorry, not too advanced after all; 50 years and they use the same fighters-computers, as we see in the 51 area sequence), I repeat, an entire civilization (as the president reads in the mind of the ""martian"", remember? They traveled all at once as friends, like the Indians in an old Spanish joke :D) destroyed in 2 days, at time for the 4th of July. You know, here in Europe we laughed deeply at cinemas with the speech of the president. And cheered, too.And then came this Godzilla flick, which is, I'm sorry again, the best movie this German-americanized-in-more-than-one-way duo has ever made.I can remember that in that time, France was really doing nuclear tests in Moruroa (or was Mururoa?). This was the perfect starting point. Given the love this two, Devlin & Emmerich, feel for their land of adoption, USA couldn't at all be responsible for the needed nuclear explosion that, traditionally, unleashed the beast, oh, no. Not the only country who has ever used the bomb against civilian targets, making later the role of victims in ""The Day After"".""But ¿what the politics have to do with a movie like this?"". Since ALL the cinema is politics, everything. And in this very case, the most. This is a film in the ""tradition"" which gave fame and fortune to Emmerich-Devlin: an old idea modernized, for all audiences (meaning this you can save the dog but not the woman in certain situations, I suppose), a constant rip of classics (it was ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in Stargate), like the galactic trench run of the helicopters after the lizard in the middle of NY among other ""homages"" (not to mention ""Jurassic Park"", another ""masterpiece"") and with nerd-but-nice scientist and too-much-nice army men (not to forget the real heroes, the french secret service) who save the day and everything.At this point I want to call your attention to the other duo, with much more artistic sense than the first one, responsible of the script; I mean the Ted Elliot-Terry Rossio tandem, writers of some very good blockbuster movies like ""The Mask of Zorro"", ""Aladdin"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean - Episode I :D"" and others. I bet my neck about the fact that, having in mind what the first team can do, the best ideas in this movie are the second's: the french not only creating the monster (only an animal hungry for fish!) but in the end destroying it (while the army destroys the luckily evacuated city; luckily for the MPAA and the rating of the film), the origin of the name of the creature and the joke about the Americanization of the original name-film, from ""Gojira"" to ""Godzilla"", and fortunately, the US army dying as idiots and destroying NY (is a right-wing classic topic to despise the media, so that's another very different thing, more to the likes of Emmerich-Devlin). About the fact that the french agent's names are ""Jean-Claude"", ""Jean Patrick"" and ""Jean-Philippe"", the ""bad"" news chief is ""Caiman"" and the ""good"" cameraman is ""Animal"", I can't possibly imagine who had the idea.The real thing is that the French save the world, man. The Army almost destroy New York. That is no good, right?Like another American hero would say, I have nothing more to say about this. And sorry for my mad engrish.(1) In Roland Emmerich's own words ""My friends in school liked Fassbinder, and I liked Star Wars"", or something like that.",Godzilla

Before 1998 it was just an old monster movie mostly cult fans cared about (at least in my part of the world).I can't say it's flawless or has everything (no film does). It's a monster/disaster film. It doesn't have monster's battling the whole time, quite frankly it was more believable than the newer one with mothra, and had better characters. (Not that the newer one doesn't have advantages).In all, watch the film if you are interested, it may not be as true to the source material (I don't know, nor have I ever cared to) but so many people these days say it's bad just because that has become the expected perspective.

I'm not usually into watching big ""monster"" movies but I thoroughly enjoyed this one! It has such a good sense of humor and the acting was for the most part quite good. I enjoyed this version of Godzilla more than the 2014 one. I've viewed other movies I really enjoyed and found out later they have a low rating so don't automatically not watch a film because it has a low rating. Although I will admit that most movies with a really low rating deserve it. I do base whether I am going to view the whole film or not on how good the acting is.

The atomic breath, the size, the stance. But I'm here for the review. Basically, they chase Zilla around New York until he gets stuck in the Golden Gate bridge and is SHOT DOWN BY Missiles. If you've seen the original and like the original, you might enjoy this, but not as a Godzilla film. As you may know, you cannot kill Godzilla with missiles. You can only TRY to CONTAIN him. I'm not saying that the original Godzilla films were better, but just because it was made in America doesn't make one of the best!

Movies are an escape from reality for an hour or two.. Do you expect everything to be ""realistic""?It reminds me of when I saw Godzilla (1998).. There was a guy in front of me with his (never to be his) girlfriend, on what I assume was their first (and hopefully last) date. He complained and moaned about how unrealistic this piece of crap was. Yes, I do agree; a big lizard eating New York is as silly as believing that the World trade centers (and building 7) went down without controlled demolitions (but that's another story)..But I couldn't help my self from mocking him on the way out as he continued to complain to the poor girl about how unrealistic it was by adding: ""For an example, do you really think Godzilla could dodge those missiles..?""Let me get this right.. He accepts that a lizard mutates from nuclear experiments. He believes that it swam to New York. He accepts that she laid eggs even though there was no Mr. Godzilla.

It is no wonder the previews showed nothing of the creature and revealed none of the story. If Godzilla fans had known that 'Godzilla' would turn out to look and act like he does in this movie, nobody would have gone to see it. This creature does not look like Godzilla in the least, and that's not even the worst part! He ACTS nothing like Godzilla, does not trample buildings, does not run towards a battle, and is a big coward. It is no wonder that Godzilla fans have taken to calling this creature G.I.N.O. (Godzilla in Name Only). The one highlight of the movie is Jean Reno. Oh, and the title sequence isn't bad either. This movie may single-handedly killed off any chance of a good film maker ever working on an American big-budget Godzilla film.",Godzilla
