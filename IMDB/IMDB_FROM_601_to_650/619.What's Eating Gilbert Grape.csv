0,TheLittleSongbird,Warm and pleasant with exceptional performances,9,13 February 2011,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape does require patience, that I do agree with. But as a film it is very involving, gentle and engaging and it also did touch me. The film is well made with striking cinematography and locations, the story and script are all well crafted and Lance Hallstrom's interesting direction makes the film warm and pleasant as it is.The performances are exceptional. The supporting performances that consist of the likes of Juliette Lewis and Crispin Glover are very winning, but I was even more impressed with the leads. As great as Johnny Depp is, it is Leonardo DiCaprio who really captivates.So all in all, a very good film and anchored especially by the acting. 9/10 Bethany Cox",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
1,bkoganbing,Grape Family Values,8,1 February 2010,"Johnny Depp whose penchant for quirky and unusual characters is a hallmark of his career plays a fairly normal kid in the title role of What's Eating Gilbert Grape. What's eating him is that he's stuck in the role of family breadwinner, guardian to his younger siblings, and in a most nowhere job. The future isn't looking up.It all kind of devolved on him naturally when years ago his father just up and left the family one day without warning, or at least without warning to a child. His mother Darlene Cates grew morbidly obese, ballooning up to 500 pounds, his sisters are having the usual adolescent problems. But his mentally retarded brother Leonardo DiCaprio who is the real problem. He needs constant watching every minute, something Cates just can't do, she can't even get up to the second story of the Grape family home. It all falls on Depp.Not that there aren't certain compensations for him, Mary Steenburgen asks for him to make special deliveries to her house when husband Kevin Tighe is at the office. But life is generally drab in Iowa for him until Juliette Lewis's trailer breaks down in the Grape neighborhood. When Depp gets involved with her she points him in the direction of a much wider world, something we all need to realize at some point in our lives.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is distinguished mostly for the Academy Award nomination it received for Leonardo DiCaprio for playing the mentally retarded Arnie Grape. DiCaprio is unbelievably convincing as a retarded kid, to think almost a decade later he'd be playing Howard Hughes on the big screen. But part of his performance is no doubt due to Johnny Depp as well. Most of DiCaprio's scenes are with Depp and they bring the best out in each other. Very much like Rain Man with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman.Both DiCaprio and Depp have gone on to give the movie-going public a wide variety of roles to see them in. But they are something special in What's Eating Gilbert Grape.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
2,SnoopyStyle,Beautiful acting,8,28 December 2013,"Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) has to care for his mentally handicap brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his morbidly obese mother (Darlene Cates) in the hard scrabble tiny town of Endora. His dad's dead. He works at the town's dying grocery store, and is having an affair with one of its customers Mrs Carver (Mary Steenburgen). Every year, the town is invaded by a fleet of trailers. One of those trailer people is Becky (Juliette Lewis).This is a dysfunctional family where everybody is tiptoeing around the mother's obesity and the tragedy of its past. These are well defined and sharply acted roles. The unspoken things are tearing this family down bit by bit. Johnny Depp is doing some beautiful acting as a guy tied down by responsibilities. Leo is believable as disabled. And Juliette Lewis is lovely. This is a gorgeous movie, both as a story and in terms of acting. Darlene Cates will break your heart.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
3,classicsoncall,"""We've always had a reasonable deal on pickles.""",8,28 November 2014,"Until today, my impression of the movie's title was that it was asking a question. It never occurred to me that the story was in fact trying to answer one. For Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), life is an imponderable existence, trapped as he is in a fatherless family with a mentally challenged younger brother (Leonardo DiCaprio), an obese mother (Darlene Cates) whose dimensions threaten the very foundation of their home, and a pair of sisters (Laura Harrington, Mary Kate Schellhardt) who find it difficult to maintain some semblance of normality in a community that considers the family a spectator attraction. But if you think about it, they might not have been the oddest characters living in Endora. The town also features a harmless joke mortician (Crispin Glover), a sad and lonely woman trapped in a loveless marriage (Mary Steenburgen), and a family friend (John C. Reilly) who insists that the soon to arrive Burger Barn is nothing short of cutting edge in the fast food industry. Into this mix arrives a free spirit angel (Juliette Lewis) who tries to help Gilbert realize his self proclaimed goal of being a good person. The film has it's absurd moments along with the bittersweet, and it was for that reason I found the marching band's choice of song to greet the Burger Barn as truly ironic - 'This Magic Moment'. By the time the picture is over, one realizes that even if our hero Gilbert has 'got nowhere to go', he's always been exactly where he needed to be.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
4,gavin6942,"Decent Film, But Not One of Depp's Better Roles",7,30 May 2011,"Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) has to care for his brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his obese mother (Darlene Cates), which gets in the way when love (Juliette Lewis) walks into his life.What really sells this film, for me, is the cast. Besides those mentioned above, we also have John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover, both of whom are amazing (and Reilly was not well-known yet, I believe). The plot itself is nothing really special, and if there is some deep message, I guess I missed it.Unfortunately, I would rank this as one of Depp's lower roles. He is not quirky, or handsome, or charming or funny. He is just a guy with terrible hair and a messed up family. I might be misjudging him because it is so unlike any other role he has done, but it did nothing for me. Depp himself felt he played the character of Gilbert in a ""boring"" way, and I agree.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
5,lee_eisenberg,"""grape"" of justified wrath",10,27 April 2006,"Leonardo DiCaprio first caught our attention as mentally retarded Arnie Grape, cared for by his brother Gilbert (Johnny Depp) in Endora*, Iowa. The movie shows how Gilbert is really in charge of the family, as their mother Bonnie (Darlene Cates) is dangerously overweight, and pretty much everything in their destitute world looks pretty grim. Among other things, there's a mega-store destroying the local place. A bleak movie, but with hope.Lasse Hallstrom brings to ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" the same great direction that he brought to ""My Life as a Dog"", ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""Chocolat"". It's a look at the whole failed state of things in the world. A truly great movie. Also starring Juliette Lewis and John C. Reilly.*While we were watching the movie, I thought that they were saying ""Andorra"", the country in the Pyrenees! Still, the town had the name of the ""Bewitched"" mother.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
6,jboothmillard,What's Eating Gilbert Grape,7,1 May 2007,"From director Lasse Hallström (The Cider House Rules), this is an inspired film with a fantastic cast of actors. Basically Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) lives in Endora, where not much happens, with his quite unusual family. He has an obese 36 stone mother Bonnie (500 pound weighing Darlene Cates), two sisters, Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), and a very close and inescapable bond with his mentally handicapped autistic brother, Arnie (Oscar nominated, and then unknown Leonardo DiCaprio). Gilbert's life is almost stolen from him by having to look after his family, particularly Arnie, but stranded free spirit Becky (Juliette Lewis) who gives him more feelings. Also starring Escape to Witch Mountain's (the crap one) Kevin Tighe as Ken Carver, The River Wild's John C. Reilly as Tucker Van Dyke and Crispin Glover as Bobby McBurney. The only giggle I laughed at was the car driving with half almost on the ground (because of the mother), there are many serious issues as well, e.g. coping with mental handicapped people, extreme obesity and losses. The most memorable moments, good and bad, are the mother being stared at (and photographed!) when leaving the police station, Gilbert striking Arnie, and the mother's tragic death after Arnie's 18th birthday (the doctor's predicted he'd die at 10) and being cremated in the house instead of having more starers see her lifted by a crane. As the only Oscar nominated was for DiCaprio's extraordinary and believable performance, he could have won it (he lost it to Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive). Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, and Johnny Depp number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
7,ccthemovieman-1,This Movie Was A Scream!,6,12 June 2007,"This was well-acted, interesting and a bizarre story but, man, one viewing was enough. That was because of Leonardo DiCaprio's title character, ""Arnie Grape,"" is hard to take in more than one dosage.The young DiCaprio, in the beginning of what has become a solid acting career, plays this mentally-challenged kid who yells all the time. Who wants to hear someone ranting and raving all the time? Not me. That ""act"" wears thin, believe me. It's shocking to see a 400-pound woman (Darlene Cates) acting in this movie, but here she is, playing the boy's mother ""Bonnie,"" and she does a fine job of acting as all do in here. That includes the weird Johnny Depp doing something really strange for him - playing a normal person, the title character of ""Gilbert Grape.""As with many stories dealing with dysfunctional families, the movie is not always a lot of fun to watch, but it's one you remember. Kudos to all concerned for a memorable film, even if I didn't care to watch it a second time....although I just might now that it's been a long time since the first viewing, and it's out on DVD.This is just one of many, many extremely interesting movies that came out in 1993, a year, I think, that was the best ever in films.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
8,Tweekums,A delightful drama set in a some where little happens,8,22 November 2012,"Endora, a small town in rural Iowa, is home to Gilbert Grape and his family. After his father committed suicide some time earlier his mother fell into a state of depression and became morbidly obese; now she doesn't even leave the house and his younger brother Arnie is mentally disabled. It is up to Gilbert and his to sisters to look after there mother and Arnie. Gilbert acts as friend and protector to his brother; it isn't easy though as he is almost eighteen but has the mind of a young child... when a child in the body of an eighteen year old decides to be naughty it can be difficult for those around him. Arnie loves climbing; he spends much of his time up various trees, he also loves climbing the town's water tower; he finds it exciting but it is obviously very dangerous. Not much happens in Endora; in fact so little happens that watching the procession of holiday makers' trailers each year is one of the things Arnie looks forward to; this year one of them will have quite of an effect on them; Becky and her mother are travelling through when their car breaks down; it will take a week or so to get the part they need and in that time Becky will have quite an effect on Gilbert.If you are looking for action and excitement or a constant stream of laughs then this isn't the film for you; however if you want a gentle story with characters who seem real, with moments of comedy, romance and tragedy then this might be just the film you are looking for. The film has a melancholy feel; Endora feels like a town that time passed by; less and less people go to the grocery store Gilbert works at because a new out of town shopping centre has been built and Gilbert's friend Tucker sees the arrival of a new Burger Barn way of getting a job with good prospects! It isn't all downbeat though; Arnie's childlike enthusiasm for life is heart-warming even if his condition makes things difficult for his family and the arrival of Becky, a beautiful girl who will only be there a week or so clearly lightens Gilbert's mood. The cast does a fine job; Johnny Depp puts in a nicely restrained performance as Gilbert; Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Arnie; one of the best performances I've seen him give and Juliette Lewis was just right as Becky; there was something almost ethereal about her which was ideal for a character who was just passing though. Also of note is Darlene Cates who put in a fine performance as the mother despite not acting before this film. Over the course of the film expect to laugh and cry but ultimately be left with a smile on your face.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
9,moonspinner55,A sweet story without much drive...,6,3 October 2005,"Slightly askew fairy tale from director Lasse Halstrom, who thankfully has abandoned his penchant for overwrought irony and comic nastiness, has a big heart but one that isn't always well-placed. Dedicated to his mentally backward brother and reclusive, overweight mother, grocery worker Gilbert Grape (a nicely understated Johnny Depp) rethinks his life after meeting an attractive young woman passing through town. The film has finely-balanced little moments that spring up at you, however Mary Steenburgen's role as a cheating wife isn't really necessary (it's just there to give us some input into Gilbert's situation), but Juliette Lewis, John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover are very charming as Gilbert's friends. Leonardo DiCaprio...you gotta hand it to him, he pulls off a tricky role with amazing aplomb. Hallstrom's film doesn't always strike the chords it wants to, and occasionally it seems to intentionally wobble while juggling its emotional priorities. Some scenes that should cut deep don't (as with Gilbert shopping at the competition and getting caught by his boss, or with Gilbert letting neighborhood kids get a peek at his mother). Still, a pleasant, thought-provoking outing, one that is nonchalant about its emotions (and its brains). It isn't a heady mix of dramatic ideas, but it does leave you with something--thoughts that may return to you a day or so after seeing it. **1/2 from ****",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
10,sunwarrior13,Ups And Downs Of A Family,10,5 January 2012,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a comedy/drama film directed by Lasse Hallström that features Johnny Depp, Juliette Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio. Peter Hedges wrote the screenplay adapted from his 1991 novel of the same title.This is a story about Gilbert,who has to care for his brother Arnie and his obese mother.The that gets in the way when love walks into his life.Gilbert Grape is busy caring for his mentally challenged brother Arnie as they wait for the many tourists' trailers to pass through town during their yearly camp ritual at a nearby recreational area. His mother, Bonnie is morbidly obese after years of depression following her husband's suicide. The relationship between the brothers is one of care and protection. In order to cope with his frenetic life, Gilbert has taken on a secret love affair with a housewife, Betty, whilst her insensitive, unsuspecting husband Ken, is fully intent on selling Gilbert insurance for his family. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their budding romance. In order to spend time with Becky watching the sun set,Gilbert leaves Arnie alone in the bathtub by himself, believing he is now old enough to get out on his own. He returns home late and wakes up the following morning to find Arnie still in the bath, shivering in the now-cold water. Gilbert's guilt is compounded by his family's anger. As a result Arnie refuses to get near water, including the pond by Becky's trailer, and his fear causes him to become extremely dirty, adding to the many problems Gilbert faces. Betty's affair with Gilbert ends when she begins to make demands on him and tries to have sex with him while he's on the phone with her husband, Ken. Ken drowns after suffering a cardiac arrest and landing face down in his sons' wading pool.Becky bonds with Gilbert and Arnie and helps Gilbert reflect on his feelings. They become deeply involved in conversation until Gilbert realizes that Arnie is missing. He has returned to the water tower he is forever trying to climb and this time has succeeded at getting to the top. Arnie is arrested, compelling Bonnie, who has not left the house in seven years, to rush to the police station to demand his release, causing her appearance to be ridiculed by the townspeople. Later at home, Arnie prematurely eats some of his birthday cake, which Gilbert told him not to touch. Gilbert orders Arnie to take a bath as punishment, and Arnie resists when Gilbert tries to force him. Losing his temper, Gilbert strikes Arnie-hard. Appalled at himself and angry at his life in general, Gilbert drives away, leaving Endora. Arnie leaves the house to find Becky, who takes care of him. Gilbert returns to town and sees Arnie with Becky, who is able to get him to enter the lake, thus overcoming Arnie's fear of water. After Amy and Ellen come to Becky's and take Arnie home, Gilbert approaches Becky and the two talk about his own frustration and the reality of his father's death. The next day he returns home during Arnie's birthday party to apologize. Following Arnie's eighteenth birthday and meeting Becky for the first time, Bonnie climbs the stairs to her bedroom for the first time in years. That evening she passes away in her bed. Arnie tries to wake her, thinking that she is just playing. He runs out of the house and begins to hurt himself. As his sisters try to stop him, they realize that Bonnie has died. Jerry, the local sheriff, and his deputies tell the Grape family that they would need more men to get Bonnie's heavy corpse out of the house. After the police leave, Gilbert and his sisters soon cry over losing her. The siblings realize that her removal would draw a gawking crowd and want to protect their mother from being a spectacle. They empty the house except for their mother's body, then Gilbert sets the house on fire.One year later, Gilbert and Arnie are looking out again to watch the trailers pass. Through voice over, Gilbert tells of Amy getting a job offer to manage a bakery in Des Moines, and Ellen being thrilled to switch schools. Arnie chases the vehicles, arms flailing, excited to see Becky again. Along with Becky and her grandma, Gilbert and Arnie hit the road.It's sentimental and somewhat predictable, but those are small complaints, given the tender atmosphere and moving performances at the heart of the film.It's fascinating to see DiCaprio before he became a bona fide star as it is to watch Depp at the very moment he cemented his reputation for coolness.Also,Depp's sincere, subtle performance is certainly a big reason for the movie's success.This was definitely a good film about the ups and downs of a family as Hallstrom finds the right bittersweet tone for his dysfunctional family tale that makes it a must-see for everyone.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
11,Boba_Fett1138,A movie with characters in their purest form.,10,26 March 2005,"In ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" we get to see different characters in their purest form. All of the characters are understandable and easy to relate to in all of their actions. It makes the emotions and drama elements in this movie feel all very real.For fans of Scandinavian cinema this movie is nothing new. Movies like this are getting made for years now over there. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" however reaches a wider range of people and make more people see the beauty and brilliance of slow cinema, in which everything is build up very slow and the story is told like a documentary like observation of the different characters.Man and was Leonardo DiCaprio brilliant in this! Even the most hardened DiCaprio hater should have to admit this. He is totally believable as a mentally-challenged young boy. He really stole the show. Also the rest of the cast is more than great. Johnny Depp is as good as always and Mary Steenburgen and Darlene Cates also know to impress.Yet the movie is more than just an emotional drama, it also knows how to be funny and entertaining about certain things at the right times without making the movie less powerful in any way.There really is nothing wrong with the piece of cinema brilliance and everything is simply perfect and works very well.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

13,view_and_review,A Lot's Eating Gilbert Grape,7,12 June 2020,"Gilbert Grape (played by Johnny Depp), by many metrics and standards, had a trying life. He was essentially trapped in the tiny town of Endora with no father, an autistic brother, and a morbidly obese mother. When I say morbidly obese, I don't mean like Nancy Pelosi's comment about Donald Trump, I mean like ""My 600 Pound Life"" obese. The only excitement and escape Gilbert had was the regular rendezvous with Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen), a desperate housewife. That is until Becky (Juliette Lewis) rolled into town.With so much going on the movie is surely going to be able to hold your attention. The young Leonardo DiCaprio was already showing his acting skills as the autistic brother, Arnie Grape. This was probably my favorite early Juliette Lewis role. The movie is a solid drama that explores the life of a family that's different than most. Maybe someone sees themselves in the Grape family and maybe not. Either way it has appeal.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
14,Aaron1375,A simple movie with a simple plot.,8,27 January 2004,"Depp plays the title character and this movie just seems to go through a typical few days in this family's life.  However, the main character is getting tired of it, and you can tell he is about to snap.  There isn't a very well defined plot, but it seems to revolve around Arnie's birthday party and the coming of motor homes that drive through the area.  This movie though doesn't revolve around plot, but rather characters.  It is more of a character study I would say.  The performances are rather good so it works for me.  First time I saw this, before I knew who Leonardo was I actually thought he was a mentally ill person playing the part.  This movie has some laughs too as it isn't all serious.  It is worth a look.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
15,Sylviastel,A Heartbreaking film!,10,11 July 2006,"I have to say that this film really broke Leonardo DiCaprio's career. He earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his role as retarded Arnie. Somebody who was never expected to survive. His brother is played by JOhnny Depp and their mother was casted by Darlene Cates who gives a superb role as the obese mother. Her performance is equally heartbreaking. Martha Plimpton plays the girlfriend or love interest to Johnny Depp's character. His character is a loving son, brother, and employee of a small grocery store where a new store in town like Walmart opens up luring their customers. Depp's character is truthful to his word even though he has to attend the supermarket because they need a birthday cake breaking his employer's heart. Their obese mother is so overweight that she spends most of her time downstairs. It's painful to watch Darlene Cates' go to the police station to pick up Arnie. He is lovable and unforgettable in his role. Depp's Gilbert is equally unforgettable. He is the son that you want. His friend is played by Crispin Glover who is a mortician. The end of the film is also unpredictable. It's worth watching and it will break your heart.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

17,JamesHitchcock,We're not going anywhere,5,7 August 2008,"In the eighties and nineties there was a popular series of children's books about the ""Garden Gang"", characters based upon fruit and vegetables with alliterative names such as Oscar Orange, Robert Raspberry, Colin Cucumber or Gertrude Gooseberry. Gilbert Grape sounds as though he should be a character from that series, but he is in fact a young man living in the small town of Endora, Iowa. (Was the town named after Agnes Moorehead's character in ""Bewitched""?) Gilbert finds himself at the head of a family which can only be described as dysfunctional. His father is dead; we later learn that his death was in fact suicide. His mother Bonnie is morbidly obese and has not set foot outside her house for several years. His elder brother Larry has left home for good, and his younger brother Arnie is mentally handicapped. (I know politically correct Americans prefer the expression ""mentally challenged"", but here in Britain that would just be a sarcastic way of calling someone stupid). There are also two sisters, Ellen and Amy, but they do not play major roles in the film.Apart from his day-job as a clerk in a grocery store, Gilbert's main responsibility is caring for Arnie (normally quite manageable, apart from his regular habit of climbing to the top of the town's water tower) and his housebound mother. What is ""eating"" Gilbert is the fact that he feels trapped by the need to care for his family but is emotionally unable to abandon them as Larry has done. He has been conducting an affair with Betty, an unhappily married local housewife, but finds a more satisfying romance when he meets Becky, a girl who roams round the country in a trailer with her grandmother; they just happen to have broken down in Endora.There is some good acting in the film, particularly from Johnny Depp as Gilbert and Juliette Lewis as the gentle, sensitive Becky. Depp has never let his status as a major star dissuade him from playing quirky roles, and here his appearance, bespectacled and with long, lank ginger hair, seems quite at variance with his normal heart-throb image. Leonardo di Caprio's performance as Arnie was reasonably good certainly better than those he gave in some of his later films such as ""Titanic"" and ""Gangs of New York""- but not, in my view, really deserving of an Oscar nomination. In the late eighties and early nineties, however, the easiest way to get a nomination seems to have been to play a disabled person. (This was, after all, the year when ""Best Actress"" went to Holly Hunter for her portrayal of a mute and ""Best Actor"" to Tom Hanks for playing an AIDS victim).I have always regarded Lasse Hallstrom as an overrated director. His more recent films ""Chocolat"" and ""The Cider House Rules"" were characterised by lush (at times cloyingly so) photography, but I felt that this was used as a smokescreen to disguise some very questionable philosophising. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is less visually sumptuous than those films; doubtless the Iowa prairies allowed Hallstrom less scope in that regard than did New England or rural France. Nor does he seem so keen to make propaganda for some dubious philosophy of life. The film has more in common with his early film, ""My Life as a Dog"", made in his native Sweden and which also dealt with a dysfunctional family.""Gilbert Grape"" could have been interesting as a tragic study of family life, but I felt that it concentrated too much on Gilbert himself and not enough on the other members of his family. Amy and Ellen are minor figures, and Bonnie and Arnie seem less like people in their own right than like plot devices to act as tests of Gilbert's patience. (The most shocking moment comes when the otherwise saintly Gilbert loses his temper with Arnie and hits him).My opening remarks about the ""Garden Gang"" were not simply meant facetiously. The slangy, colloquial title (""eating"" is here given its colloquial meaning of ""worrying"", with possible quibbles on the literal meaning and the alternative slang meaning of ""performing oral sex"") and the jokey name of the central character give the misleading impression that the film is an eccentric, offbeat comedy. There are, certainly, comic elements, but these sit uneasily with the film's more serious themes. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is not a bad film, rather a mediocre one, often long-winded with little to say. At one point Arnie exclaims ""We're not going anywhere!"". Watching this film, I knew how he felt. 5/10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,A film that will never age and you will always have a place for in your heart,10,12 November 2003,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of those little treasures that for the most part most people do know about, mainly due to Leonardo DiCaprio's knock out performance as Arnie Grape. But both he and Johnny had this great chemistry together that made what could have been a very boring movie into an extremely touching piece of film that meant more and more to me as I grew up. When I was a kid and watched this film, I just loved laughing at all of Arnie's jokes not realizing why he was so silly. As a teenager I could start to relate to having a little more pressure with a job and school. Then as an adult and having my mother become ill, I could relate completely to Gilbert in his frustrations of just wanting to be young and enjoy his life. I think that's why this film is special to a lot of people, those who have felt the added little pressures in life and makes you think on what's eating at you? This is the story of Gilbert Grape.In the small town of Endora, Gilbert Grape is busy caring for his mentally handicapped brother, Arnie. His morbidly obese mother, Bonnie has done little except eat since her husband died, and longs only to see Arnie live to the age of 18. With Bonnie unable to care for her children on her own, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and looking after Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the town water tower, while his sisters Amy and Ellen do the rest. The relationship between the brothers is of both care and protection, as Gilbert continually enforces the 'nobody touches Arnie' policy. A new ""Foodland"" supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery where Gilbert works. In addition, Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman, Betty Carver. The family is looking forward to Arnie's 18th birthday. A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when their car breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their possible romance. His affair with Mrs Carver ends when she leaves town in search of a new life following her husbands death,. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie and as she talks to Gilbert she begins to unlock some buried hopes, dreams and happiness. Later on, Arnie tries to run away yet again from his bath and in his frustration Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert takes the car and runs out without another word, fearing that he is leaving his family just like his father and brother did.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is just an incredibly beautiful and touching movie that will always have a special place in my heart. It makes you laugh, cry, and think about how precious life is. All the characters are relatable or likable in some way. Even in the smallest of all towns where it seems like it's just dead, there is life. That's what this movie is about to me, everyone has a story and everyone has an experience to share. This is just a terrific film, quality acting and a heart felt story, I very much recommend that if you get the chance to watch it. If anything for Leonardo DiCaprio's incredible performance and Johnny Depp singing to him ""Match in the gas tank, boom boom!"".10/10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
19,g-bodyl,A Story That Spreads the Warmth!,10,6 October 2014,"When people talk about Leonardo DiCaprio and his films, they seem to overlook this film, What's Eating Gilbert Grape. While the film takes it time and can be overly melodramatic, this is an excellent drama that will make you cry, make you happy, and will as hell sure make an imprint in your memory. It's about the small-town friendship and most of all, it's about family bonding. This film has a beautiful script and many of these quotes are actually quite memorable.Lasse Hallstrom's film is about a twenty-year-old named Gilbert Grape who is nearly fed up with his small-town life. He has a mother who weighs nearly five hundred pounds and is the joke of the town. He has two sisters and a special-needs brother that he constantly cares for. He works for a small grocery and he satisfies the need of a lonely mother while her husband is away at work. But when a camper girl named Becky comes to town, a romance is blossomed and now Gilbert is at the ultimate life stage.The acting is absolutely tremendous. Johnny Depp, in one of his few straight-forward roles, does a fantastic job as the depressed man who cares for his family. I think the real standout is Leonardo DiCaprio. Without this role, I don't believe we would have gotten the future films of his that we all come to love. That being said, this as well may be Leo's best performance and he has given many. There are also great performances from Darlene Cates, Mary Steenburgen, and Juliette Lewis.Overall, What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a film that stands out in the very crowded year of 1993. Of such films like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Philadelphia, and Carlito's Way, this film may be my favorite. It will provide you with a range of emotions whether it's laughter or sadness and this film excels in provoking emotion. It's a little predictable, but then again almost every drama is. Thanks to a magnificent script and fantastic acting all across the board, this is one of the best dramas ever made. I rate this film 10/10.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
20,cricketbat,Glad I finally saw it,6,7 July 2018,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a very odd film. And while everyone in the cast does a good job, Leonardo DiCaprio stands out with one of the most convincing performances I've seen in a long time. At times, I forgot Arnie was the same guy from Inception. I probably won't make a habit of watching this movie, but I'm glad I finally saw it.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
21,Irishchatter,You would get a lump in your throat watching this film!,9,3 November 2015,"It was great to see two future Hollywood legends on this! You wouldn't think it was Leonardo Dicaprio when he acted as a severely mentally disabled kid. His expressions, his mannerisms and his screams sounded so real that I was so mind blown of it all!Johnny Depp looked good with having long hair, he definitely looks pure country in which you would rarely see him look like that in his films! The women in the cast probably had their wishes come true whenever they had to kiss him! I found that his character never shouted throughout the film like he had a lot of problems at home and he did in some scenes, looking like he was gonna explode. It wasn't right for him to hit Arnie since he doesn't do anything bad but only shouts really. Whilst Leonardo thought it was fun, I say it was absolutely exhausting to be going all over the place in some scenes and shouting probably gave him a bigger headache too haha! I didn't like the arguments between the families and I say the reason why they always had the arguments was because of keeping Arnie safe and happy. Even though, Leonardo Dicaprio does not have a disability for real but he showed us extraordinary on what it would be like if we were in a disabled persons body!",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
22,callanvass,Wonderfully acted and moving film. It's one of my favorite drama's of all time.,9,26 June 2010,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape never fails to get my emotions all riled up when all is said and done. The acting is honestly some of the best I have ever seen in a movie. Johnny Depp deserved to be Oscar nominated, while Dicaprio deserved his Oscar nomination for supporting actor in his brilliant portrayal of Arnie as the mentally handicapped individual. This isn't your usual family type drama, it's very different and unique and that's what I loved about it. Gilbert is basically a loner, he goes by his own tune, only caring about Arnie and his well-being, while having a small affair with someone's wife. Becky|Juliette Lewis| and Gilbert have the most unusual, yet sweet romance together. It's not the typical fall in love story, it's done with creativity and with two eccentric characters, I just loved how it was done. The ending itself is one of the saddest I've personally ever seen. This movie gave me many emotions. It made me teary eyed, it made me laugh, it warmed my heart and it made me angry, all the qualities that I look for in a Drama.Performances. Johnny Depp gives an Oscar worthy show here. His character isn't as complex as some of the others perhaps, but people really tend to forget he is the heart of the movie. He is instantly likable from the start, and his eccentric character was fabulous!. Leonardo DiCaprio deserved his Oscar nomination, and made me believe he truly was handicapped. His voice, his laugh was just a phenomenal showcase of acting and he proves why he deserves his reputation as one of Hollywood's most gifted actors. Juliette Lewis's cute but odd character worked for me. She was likable and had good chemistry with Johnny Depp. Mary Steenburgen's character I felt very sorry for. Her sadness, yet greediness at the same time made for a very intriguing character. Darlene Cates doesn't have a very long acting resume, but her character as the infamous over-weight mom is memorable. People like John C. Reilly and Kevin Tighe are both great in their roles.Bottom line. This is one of the greatest dramas of all time in my opinion. This truly deserves to be on IMDb's top 250, and it's a shame it isn't. An absolute must see.9 1/2 /10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

24,Thanos_Alfie,Amazing...,7,30 October 2020,"""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a young man in a small town trying to balance his life with some family issues. He is working to help his family while he is trying his best in order to take care of his mentally-disabled younger brother.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but interesting plot and some simply outstanding performances. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that I was amazed by the interpretation of Leonardo DiCaprio who played as Arnie Grape and he was simply exceptional. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Johnny Depp's who played as Gilbert Grape and Juliette Lewis' who played as Becky. The direction which was made by Lasse Hallström was very good and he presented very well both the character Gilbert Grape, his mentality, his dreams, his fears and his younger brother's disability. Finally, I have to say that ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is a beautiful movie that everybody has to watch because I am sure that you will learn and think more about your dreams, your problems and your life in general after watching it.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
25,Dr_Coulardeau,Life is such a bully at times!,10,27 January 2008,"One of these films that are an essential step in the career of an actor. It was true for Leonardo DiCaprio who got his first Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for the role of a differently-abled kid . It is true he does a good job in that part and he is a brilliant couple with Johnny Depp as his bigger brother. The film is entertaining though on many other levels. The survival of a small town in the US at a time when big shopping malls are opening everywhere. These small towns are doomed to die sooner or later. Their only chance is to become suburban development projects and become the home of people working in the big city next door who want to live away from the hectic activity of the city and commute there every day. We are before this development in Endora. The second interest is the fate of a family in which there is a mentally disabled child. Here they have no opportunity to provide him with an education and some professional activity. So he is more or less attached to a member of his family and he is haunting if not even worse that brother of his, as well as the police and neighbors. It is never vicious but it is really bothering those who want to have peace and quiet. The place of mentally disabled people in our society is something difficult to envisage because they are necessarily a burden to normative people and a normative system that has to adapt to them and not the reverse. Today things have changed a lot, thanks to such films probably, definitely. Then the film attaches itself to showing the mother who is an extremely obese person, her shame, her humiliation, her lot that is close to an ordeal. The film shows how dependent she is on her own family, on her own children, the father having died a long time before. And the film tries to show her under the best light they can afford. On her disabled son's birthday, after having accepted to be introduced to her elder son's girl friend (a young woman who had to stop in Endora with her mother and their traveling bus for a couple of weeks because of the breakdown of the car they travel in), after climbing back up to the second floor bedroom of the house for the first time in many years and lying there on her back, she dies without any kind of pain or noise with her disabled son calling for her to wake up. The film though has a strange ending. The children decide to burn her in the house since she cannot be taken down. A domestic pyre for the mother and a complete liberation for the children who are scattered away now they are homeless. The burial of old civilizations, of the Hinduist tradition. Amazing. And yet it is not the end. A last scene shows how the elder brother is recuperated by his girlfriend who comes back to pick him up and away from Endora and by picking one she gets two because the disabled brother comes along too. That's what happens when a mechanical incident forces you to stop over in a lost village in the countryside for a couple of weeks. You get trapped in some kind of sentimental cage like the disabled brother's crickets in his glass jar where he raises them. A good decent softly entertaining film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
26,Red-125,Ignore the title--watch the movie,9,5 December 2020,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) was directed by Lasse Hallström. The title suggests that it's a comedy for children. It's not. It's a serious and important movie.Johnny Depp stars as Gilbert Grape. That's not a nickname. His family name is Grape. Gilbert is a decent guy, but he's beset by problems. He lives in a town that's dying; he lives in a house that is in danger of collapsing; he has a younger brother who has brain damage; his mother is morbidly obese and can barely move out of her chair.Depp does a good job as Gilbert, but two actors outshine him. One is Darlene Cates, who was, indeed, morbidly obese. (At one point in her life she weighed 575 pounds.) Cates was a good actor--she didn't just have one dimension. She loved her children, and she understood how difficult their lives were because of her. Her acting makes us understand that.Leonard DiCaprio brilliantly portrayed the brother with brain damage. The young man was strong and agile. His executive function was deficient--it simply didn't occur to him that climbing up the town water tower would cause immense trouble for himself, his family, and the town. He climbed up whenever he could, which was too often for the town police, and ended up in jail.Leonard DeCaprio was then Leonardo DeCaprio. He played this key role in the movie when he was still a teenager! (Of course, he's an important star now but he wasn't a star in 1993.)This movie has a strong IMDb rating of 7.8. I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 9. (The film was recommended by a friend. I've learned to trust her.)",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
27,TheMovieDiorama,'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' is a classic 90s feel-good drama bolstered by an impeccable supporting performance.,8,5 August 2018,"Leonardo DiCaprio. Even at such a young age, he garnered acclaim for his performances to which this challenging role may just be one of his best. A young man named Gilbert Grape is tasked with looking after his morbidly obese mother and mentally impaired brother, whilst developing a romance with the new girl in town. Both a family drama and a character study, where the primary focus is on the titular individual. The frustration of these unfortunate situations accumulate as he attempts to retain his inner rage to prevent his family from being destroyed. The stress and attentiveness of caring for two family members that constantly need looking after can be quite overbearing. Depp gives one of his better performances in what is a rather nuanced iteration of the character. His cool calm demeanour masquerades the anxiety within. It has to be said though, that DiCaprio easily stole the spotlight. Absolutely incredible performance. The innocence behind the tics and shenanigans that his mental illness causes was conveyed with the utmost of delicacy. It was difficult to watch certain scenes, he was that masterful. Cates was also noteworthy for her commanding role. Hedges, who originally wrote the novel, crafts a screenplay that retains the heart and tenderness of its source material. It's a classic 90s narrative structure where the story illustrates a clear beginning and conclusion without resorting to ambiguity, where you also feel that the characters have truly been developed as the plot progresses. Hallström's directing techniques were rather basic, which unfortunately prevented the cinematography from revealing itself. Some variations in direction would've elevated the drama, particularly the romance and affair, however the end result is nice. That's honestly the best way to describe this film. It's nice. Remove the performances and it would just be ""good"", but fortunately we have Depp and DiCaprio giving it their best.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
28,Anonymous_Maxine,A change of pace for almost everyone involved results in spectacular success.,10,10 November 2006,"I recently stumbled upon the last half of one of those Top 50 Child Stars TV shows, which had a segment on Leonardo DiCaprio, showing interviews with him when he first started acting and would make jokes about how famous and rich he was, having had no way of knowing how astronomically rich and famous he would go on to be. Anyway, the show described his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape as one of his most charming, which turned out to be a tremendous understatement.The film takes place in the motionless town of Endora, Iowa, and concerns the world of Gilbert Grape, whose life is in a constant state of turmoil. He works for a tiny local general store that has come under the competitive strain of a massive supermarket which has opened just outside of town. Needless to say, the store is a major topic of conversation among the local townspeople, because a big store in a town like Endora is big news. I think the real charm of the movie lies in the fact that it is able to portray what you normally might consider to be a highly dysfunctional family and make them charming and, in the context of the town and world they live in, lovable. All of the problems that the family suffers on a daily basis are right at the forefront throughout the film, but no one ever really seems unhappy, except for the mother, and we get the feeling that her unhappiness is both the cause and the result of her morbid obesity. We get a brief explanation of how she came to be so heavy, but not really much more than, ""I wasn't always like this."" Gilbert is about 21 and seems to be the only one mature (and mentally and physically able) enough to hold the family together, and the majority of the movie focuses on his struggles to do that in normal life. He is in charge of his mentally retarded brother Arnie (DiCaprio), has to periodically subdue his intolerably obnoxious sister, who looks like she belongs in a different family and a different society (and she believes that, too), while at the same time getting to work on time, hanging out at coffee shops with his similarly offbeat friends talking about the undertaking business. In between all of this, a local desperate housewife periodically orders groceries for delivery from the general store where he works, and she tends to be a little less desperate after he leaves.It seems that all of this normality, charming in both its daily routine and its total difference from the daily monotony that the majority of us are used to, is presented to us so that we can get to know Gilbert, his daily life, and his family, as they are before the cataclysmic arrival of Becky (Juliette Lewis). Becky is on a vacation of sorts with her mother and stops in Endora long enough for her and Gilbert to develop a romantic interest in each other, and she thereby breaks the series of monotonies which the first part of the movie introduced us to. Monotonies which may have continued forever had she not arrived. There are a series of events that take place after Becky arrives as Gilbert tries to assimilate her into his well-established life, testing the waters and taking new risks that he would never have even considered before, and learning something about himself from the results, as we all do. The Grapes are a family that would very likely knock you off your feet if you were to run into almost any of them in person, but the movie is so good at treating them as humans that they are not a spectacle at all, even when Arnie is repeatedly climbing the local water tower, much to the chagrin of the local police force, who have been promised repeatedly that this is the last time. It never is, and when we see Arnie up there on the tower, we cheer for him, and the reason we cheer for him is the same reason why the movie is so effective.We don't cheer for him because we identify with his struggle against a couple of grumpy cops, but as though he has made an accomplishment, because in his mind, he has.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
29,robert-temple-1,A timeless classic,10,8 December 2011,"Seeing this again after 18 years, it is more alive and vital than it was when it was released. The innate truth and honesty of this sad, strange tale cannot fade, and that is why I call this film a timeless classic. The film is quirky and full of highly individual, not to say eccentric, characters. The director Lasse Hallstrom, who is of Swedish origin and is perhaps best known in America for his marvellous HACHI: A DOG'S TALE (2009, see my review), specialises in exploring deep feelings and emotions, and seems to prefer those of unusual people, including even dogs who are people. As a dog-lover, I am pleased that Hallstrom realizes that dogs are people. In fact, Hallstrom seems to have a sympathy for outcasts. One might consider dogs outcasts, in that they are denied human status except by those in the know. In this film, the central character is an outcast, a woman named Bonnie Grape, who is enormously fat, about 500 pounds in fact, so that she can barely stand. She not only stays in her house and refuses to go outdoors, but she declines even to go upstairs to her own bedroom, and has spent seven years living and sleeping on the sofa in her living room. She is played by Darlene Cates, a genuine Texan with an authentic accent, which helps make the film convincing, as it is set in a small Texas town in the 1950s. In terms of the action, Bonnie is a peripheral character, but in terms of the story, she is its heart. She became fat through uncontrolled and compulsive comfort-eating caused by depression after her husband hung himself in the basement of their large, rambling farmhouse on the outskirts of town. In one central pathetic scene, she says apologetically to a visitor: 'I wasn't always like this.' Her elder son, beautifully and sensitively played by Johnny Depp, tells a girl friend that Bonnie was once so pretty. This unusual story is from a novel by Peter Hedges, who also wrote the screenplay for the film. One wonders what inspired him. Whatever it was, it was deeply felt. He was born in Iowa, and one wonders if this story's mythical town of Endora, though filmed in Texas, may represent some place in Iowa best known to himself. This film contains so many exquisitely sensitive performances that from the acting point of view it is nothing short of a miracle. The most astounding of all is that of 19 year-old Leonardo Di Caprio, then little known, as Arnie, the younger brother of Johnny Depp. Arnie is mentally handicapped, of the kind which often occurs through oxygen deprivation at birth. He is about to reach his 18th birthday but is mentally like an unruly and unpredictable child. I don't know how Di Caprio did it, but he must have studied such people very closely, since his every gesture and movement, and every aspect of his speech, is one hundred percent accurate. There is not a single scene where he lets us glimpse the real Leonardo. It is a tour de force of epic dimensions. For those who think OF MICE AND MEN (1939, see my review) was deeply moving, try this, which is far more so. The intense devotion to Arnie shown by Depp reminds us of RAIN MAN (1988), where Tom Cruise was similarly devoted to Dustin Hoffman. The ever-watchable Juliette Lewis, that weird-looking gal you can't take your eyes off for a minute, passes through town in a trailer with her mother, and becomes a sort-of girlfriend for Depp. She instinctively understands and accepts Arnie, who becomes attached to her. Depp has had a disturbing affair with a frustrated married woman of the town, brilliantly played by Mary Steenburgen. Everyone in the small town is frustrated, which one might say is sometimes the standard condition of a small town, especially one as small as 'Endora', the name suggesting the end of the road, since no one ever leaves, and they either die by drowning in a child's paddle pool (the fate of Steenburgen's husband) or just moulder away. The film is full of marvellously quirky humour, and has scenes which are riotously funny. So the pathos is constantly lightened by eruptions of the ludicrous. Hallstrom has accomplished a marvellous balancing act, as he never sacrifices the sadness to laughs, but he never allows life's tragedies to get in the way of a good guffaw at human follies. It all works. It might have been better if the surname had been changed from Grape, and if the title had not been a pun on eating a grape. That lessens the impact of this classic film, for unless one knows how wonderful it is, and if one just comes upon the DVD by browsing, one might be inclined to dismiss it as some trivial inferior comedy. The film is also distinguished by the anguished performances of Laura Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt as Depp's two long-suffering sisters. Every aspect of this film is a triumph. If only there were many more like it. It is a magnificent example of a film which uplifts the human spirit.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
30,thinker1691,The Silence of Regrets,5,21 October 2005,"In the film ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", anyone who has been cursed with a common family, will find a deep kinship with Johnny Depp. Playing Gilbert Grape, Depp does an admirable job of sustaining a sympathetic role for himself and his retarded brother, played equally superb by Leonardo DiCaprio. Included among his additional sufferings Gilbert must endure is his obese mother, who blames her huge weight problem on her husband's death. His two sisters add to his burden as does an unfaithful wife and traveling woman in a streamline trailer. Gilbert endures the given facts of his dull, uneventful and nondescript life with seemingly limitless patience. He further accepts the troubling circumstances of his half-wit brother who persistently seeks the summits of a city water tower. His world drifts from tedium to tedium until finally it explodes with an unexpected but understandable rage. Somewhere in the aftermath, Gilbert discovers a renewed compassion, a soul saving reason for continuing his existence and the dark root of his mother's weighty affliction. Gilbert saves her humiliation with a modicum of dignity. Regrets are forgotten, life must go on. **",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
31,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,20 March 2021,"So, I had no idea who Leonardo was when I saw this back in the 90s, it was before Titanic, before he made it big, and I thought they hired an intellectually disabled man to play the part.And it dropped in '93 so that would make Dicaprio about 19? Maybe 18 when they made it?I doubt they would give an Oscar to a kid that young, but see that he's CLEARLY not Intellectually Disabled and how believable he was, well, that's probably one of the best performances I've seen. That was Oscar worthy.Besides that, it was really a Johnny Depp vehicle... as much as a 90s indy film can be, and he played a calm, low key, and utterly charming role in a film about a man that had to maybe grow up too fast and deal with too much at too young an age.And, of course, a charming little love story. A charming story about family. About loyalty.There is honestly absolutely nothing to criticize here, except, it's certainly a 90s story, a 90s movie, and if you are removed from Gen-X, it might not have the appeal. This isn't the over-the-top FX sort of films that are a hallmark of the Millennial generation......but beyond that, KUDOS to Leo for nailing it as such a young age, and a cheers to everyone else involved for making a brilliant and entertaining hidden gem of a film",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
32,ackstasis,A Very Good Film!,7,29 August 2006,"'What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' a film by Lasse Hallström, is not your average movie. There are no stunning visual effects, no mind-blowing stunt-work and even the film setting is somewhat dull and lifeless. However, the movie is a very good one, for it is driven by its diverse range of characters.Gilbert Grape, played by Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Pirates Of The Caribbean), does not think much of his home town. He describes Endora, population 1091, as a place he sorely wishes not to be, like ""dancing with no music."" About 21 years of age, Gilbert became the fatherly figure in the somewhat dysfunctional household after his father committed suicide some years ago. Alongside his work at a struggling local grocery store, Gilbert has a very difficult personal life. Between caring for his intellectually disabled brother (Leonardo DiCaprio- Titanic, Catch Me If You Can) and his dangerously obese mother (Darlene Cates), Gilbert is trapped in a very intimate relationship with Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen), a lonesome housewife to whom Gilbert makes frequent deliveries. However, everything that Gilbert believes about life suddenly changes with the arrival of Becky (Juliette Lewis), a stranded camper who shows Gilbert to look at the bigger picture, rather than focus on the negatives.The acting performances are generally superb. Depp, who mastered the role of a quiet outsider in 'Edward Scissorhands,' steps painlessly into the role of Gilbert Grape, a man confused by his own emotions and the sudden changes happening in his life. However, the highlight of the film is, without a doubt, the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. In a both funny and convincing role that deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination, and displayed the greatness that he would later achieve, DiCaprio portrays Gilbert's intellectually disabled brother, Arnie, who is currently ecstatic about his coming 18th birthday party and occupies himself by climbing the town water tower and forgetting how to get down.'What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is a great film with a warm heart. Its characters are convincingly portrayed and easy to relate to, and the story brings the drama to great levels. Perhaps the only flaw I found with the film was that there was much of the same throughout, and the dry Iowa setting was not very appealing to the eye. However, this somewhat dull repetitiveness also serves to convey the monotony of Gilbert's life- a routine that is suddenly plunged into chaos with each unforeseen change.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

34,estebangonzalez10,An emotional family drama with standout performances from DiCaprio and Depp,8,11 May 2015,"""I want Momma to take aerobics classes. I want Ellen to grow up. I want a new brain for Arnie. I want""Looking back at Leonardo DiCaprio's filmography I'm constantly reminded what a great actor he is. In What's Eating Gilbert Grape, he plays a seventeen year old mentally ill kid in such a natural way that if I didn't know this was Leo I would've believed the actor playing Arnie was really mentally ill. This is probably one of his standout performances and is one of the highlights of this emotionally gripping family drama. However he is just a supporting character in this film as the title character is played by Johnny Depp, Arnie's older brother who is always taking care of him and the rest of the family. Gilbert's father has abandoned them and ever since he has been the male role model for the family in the small community where they live. He not only takes care of Arnie, he also has to provide for the family by working in a small local supermarket. He is ashamed of his obese mother (Darlene Cates), who simply stopped caring about her beautiful body after her husband abandoned her. Gilbert also has two sisters who help out with the family chores, Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt). The responsibility Gilbert feels towards his family has taken its toll on him and explains why he seems to be half asleep all the time. He has no time for accomplishing any personal goals or dreams and spends his few free minutes with his local friends, Tucker (John C. Reilly) and Bobby (Crispin Glover). Things take an unexpected turn when Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives in town and the two form a special bond together. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an emotionally gripping family drama that works thanks to the strong performances from the cast and a fantastically well written script by Peter Hedges. The film avoids feeling cliché or melodramatic and I found it to be an honest story. Lasse Hallstrom has been accused of being overly melodramatic at times, but I think that the director avoided much of those moments here thanks in most part to a well written script.Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of the film, but Johnny Depp also delivers in a very subtle way. His character doesn't seem to say much, but the way he simply moves and speaks says a lot about him. He knows he isn't getting anywhere in life and feels stuck in this small town, but at the same time he has responsibilities and knows that his family relies on him to survive. He is trapped in a prison he can't get out of. He cares deeply for his family, but at the same time he resents them and it seems they have become a burden for him. The way he approaches the character is fascinating because he doesn't have to say or do anything for us to understand how he feels. We can easily identify and sympathize for his character. The chemistry he shares with Lewis is also strong. She is in some ways the opposite of him. She is free spirited and has travelled across several states. She doesn't have many responsibilities, and the two end up complementing each other quite well. Their relationship might not be the central theme of the movie, but it does lighten up the mood a bit. Reilly is always funny on screen and despite playing a more serious character he still delivers his usual quirky silliness to the role. All these small relationships are the central theme of the movie and the brotherhood between Depp and DiCaprio stands out above them all. I enjoyed this family drama and I'm glad I finally got a chance to watch it. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
35,Lechuguilla,Trapped,9,26 February 2008,"Small American towns nurture kindness and big hearts, as personified by Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), a twenty year old guy who heads a loving but difficult family of two younger sisters, a mentally retarded younger brother named Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), and their obese momma (Darlene Cates). These are humble, unpretentious common folks who do the best they can. But life in a small town in Iowa is hard, and it can be frustrating and confining. At times, you can feel ... trapped.The film's theme is explicit. Gilbert is trapped in a vexing family. Arnie is trapped in a body with a flawed brain. Momma is trapped in an obese body. A local woman named Betty (Mary Steenburgen) is trapped in an unsatisfying marriage. A young woman named Becky (Juliette Lewis) is trapped with her grandmother in the town by an RV that has broken down while passing through. Even a grasshopper gets trapped in Arnie's mischievous hands.Seeing good people trapped in difficult situations is poignant. The film really tugs at your heartstrings. In one sequence, momma must face gawkers as she leaves the courthouse. Her response is inspiring and majestic. Darlene Cates does a wonderful job in this role.Gilbert and his family live in a modest house. Its interior reminds me of the grim, depressing house in the movie ""Silkwood"" (1983). The dinner table must be moved each meal to wherever momma is sitting. And typical family conversation centers on preparation for Arnie's birthday party, and debate over ways to cook bacon.A friend helps Gilbert reinforce the wood floor under Gilbert's house, so that the floor won't collapse under the weight of momma. Gilbert is kind, and has a big heart. And he is very protective of Arnie who has a habit of climbing up the town's water tower.The townsfolk are satisfied with fulfilling small dreams, like getting a job at the new burger barn, or getting an ice cream snack at the local ""Dairy Dreme"". Small American towns ... life is familial and loving, but it can also be confining. And this film reminds me a lot of ""The Last Picture Show"" (1971).The acting in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is very good, as is the color cinematography, and production design. I did find the Arnie character to be a bit grating at times. The film's plot is slightly repetitive. And I don't care for the film's title. But these are minor issues.""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is a heartfelt story about life in a small American town, with all its kindness, big hearts, and familial love, despite the hardships.

It wasn't pretty; in fact it's kind of hard to watch, but I can't begrudge him his Oscar nomination.

You could say from start that he will become great actor. These two are maybe my favorite duo ever but I can't wait for Tarantino's Once upon a time in Hollywood, in which we will see maybe the greates duo ever Dicaprio and Brad Pitt.

40,dierregi,When Depp was still an actor and not the parody of himself,1,24 June 2020,"I guess this movie must struck a chord with the American audience but it did nothing for me, except regretting what a good actor Depp could have been and how Di Caprio turned into a much better one than one might have expected.Two careers that crossed and reached Oscar on one side and the grotesque on the other... Depp is the Gilbert of the title, a young man you'd feel sorry for, since his father committed suicide, his mother turned into a ""whale"" (his description), his younger brother Arnie is seriously mentally challenged and his two sisters not much of a use.Gilbert lives in Smallville, Middle-of-Nowhere, and the highlight of his life is an affair with a married mother of two. He would like a more ""normal"", young man life, but he's tied down by his family, especially by Arnie.Di Caprio's interpretation can be described either as ""realistic"" (going ""full retard"", quoting Tropic Thunder) or annoying as hell. I opted for the second option and did not enjoy the movie at all.The plot is about Gilbert love/hate relationship with Arnie, his budding love for newcomer Becky and the resolution of his other family issues.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

42,PredragReviews,"""Somedays you want him to live, somedays... you don't""",8,10 May 2016,"If you want to see DiCaprio at his best, this is the film to see! As many times as I watch it, his portrayal of Arnie, a retarded soon to be 18 year old boy, never ceases to amaze me! His performance is captivating. DiCaprio becomes Arnie. This film is an extremely touching story of family loyalty, albeit dysfunctional family loyalty. The title character is played exceptionally well by Johnny Depp, but it is difficult to focus on anyone but Leonardo DiCaprio. The best scenes in the film are those between Depp and DiCaprio. Gilbert is Arnie's primary caretaker. His love for Arnie is undeniable but marred by frustration and on occasion, resentment that he has been saddled with the burden of being his brother's keeper.But for most of the movie Depp plays a kind of straight man to DiCaprio's goofball antics. They have a wonderful chemistry together, for not only do they mine some restrained comedy from these scenes, but they also ably portray a strong brotherly bond. Gilbert will care for Arnie till the day he dies; Arnie loves and trusts Gilbert, even if he has not the mental capacity to understand why. This is the most carefully crafted film I've ever seen. Every scene, almost every line, reinforces the theme and illuminates the main characters' motivations. In my opinion, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is as nearly perfect as play writing gets.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Even more so for Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) than the rest of us. He has a annoying and immature younger sister, a morbidly obese mother, the shadow of his father's suicide still hangs over his family, he has a complicated relationship with an older, married woman, and there's a new girl (Juliette Lewis) in town who's full of experiences of life beyond the area where Gilbert feels he may be stuck forever. Added to all that, Gilbert has a younger brother (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is mentally handicapped, and who unintentionally provides challenges and additional stress for Gilbert and his family. So, what's eating Gilbert Grape? A lot.I found the movie to be a pleasant surprise, even though I'm not typically into this sort of thing. Depp may not exactly fit his character physically, but as far as the acting goes, he was great. Genuine, expressive, and relatable. As were all the actors, especially DiCaprio. This is one of those movies where you can't help but sympathize with the characters, and even feel a lot of what they're feeling, yourself. The drama never becomes cloying or sappy, there are no artificial attempts to tug at your heartstrings, and as a result, the story feels refreshingly organic.

44,philip_vanderveken,The movie got only one Oscar nomination and didn't win any. Hard to understand why!,8,24 September 2004,"What's eating Gilbert Grape is a very original and moving film about a young man (Gilbert Grape, played by Johnny Depp) who, after the death of his father, has to take care about his obese mother (he calls her a beached whale once) and his younger brother who's 18, but with the mental capacities of a 5 year old. He has a love-hate relationship with his mom and brother. He loves them, but sometimes he can't take it any more and has to flee from them. Living in a very small town, where there is absolutely nothing to do, he hasn't much reasons to be happy. But than he meets the intriguing Becky (played by Juliette Lewis).This movie is really well made. The characters are excellently portrayed, the story is touching but not too heavy... It is said to be a comedy / drama, but personally I think you better call it a drama with some funny moments. If this funny moments wouldn't be in the movie, it would probably be very hard to keep watching it with as much attention as you do now.The movie got only one Oscar nomination, which is hard to understand. It really deserved more than that one nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio and should at least have won one Oscar, but it didn't. Too bad, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good movie of course. I reward it with an 8/10.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
45,bandw,The title's question is soon answered,7,25 December 2007,"You don't have to get very far into this movie to see what's eating Gilbert Grape. Absent a father in the family, he has a mentally disabled brother and a 500 pound mother to deal with and be responsible for. It's a testament to his good nature that he is not only coping with this, but he has strong bonds with both brother and mother. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Gilbert's brother Arnie with a perfect balance for us to see how difficult he is to deal with, but why he is lovable. Any more disabled and he would probably have to be institutionalized and any less so he would not present the personal challenges for Gilbert that are at the crux of this movie. DiCaprio's performance is an amazing feat of acting.Depp plays Gilbert with such quiet, gentle charm that you hardly know he is acting (maybe he isn't?) His presence is a counterbalance to the chaos in his household. However, he can be pushed beyond his limits and that made him more real to me - he is not a saint. We are left to wonder if Gilbert's personality has been shaped by his environment as a coping mechanism or whether he is intrinsically disposed to making the best of difficult situations. I think the latter.The people are not stereotyped and we come to understand and care for them. There are similarities here with ""The Last Picture Show,"" with the events taking place in a small run-down town, the relationship between the brothers, Gilbert's liaison with a married woman, and people just trying to play the hands they have been dealt as best they can. Juilette Lewis, as Gilbert's ultimate love interest is rather one-dimensional compared to the rest of the characters.What if you were in Gilbert's situation? Would you be as responsible, accepting and understanding?",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

There's a married woman who can't keep her hands off of him whose husband would like to kill him. He's got a younger brother that is cuckoo, and he's responsible for him. He's got to take care of him. He works in a grocery store. His life is about groceries. Honk if you've got groceries...He's trapped in Endora, somewhere, probably Kansas or Nebraska or Iowa (actually filmed in Texas), somewhere in the heart of the Heartland--by the way this is the sort of American film that plays as a foreign film in, say, France or Sweden. Along comes Juliette Lewis who's a bit of a short-haired punk to his long-haired country (""Get in the car, longhair""). He is wallowing in self-pity and she sees it. ""What about you?"" she asks. ""What do you want?"" She attracts him and frightens him. She may make him upset his predictable life as Job. And then one day, he loses it and hits Arnie, and hits him again. Who can blame him? But you don't hurt Arnie. He is just a boy who will always be a boy.Johnny Depp is Gilbert Grape, Leonardo DiCaprio is Arnie, Mary Steenburgen is the married woman, Juliette Lewis is Becky and Darlene Cates is Mama. They all give sterling performances. The script and direction are flawless. You've probably seen bits and pieces of this movie on TV. See the whole thing. It is an outstanding flick. Gilbert is an America hero. He knows the good and the bad, and he always tries to do the good. But it's tough. Life is an embarrassment and a boredom, and when it isn't boring, it's scary emotionally. Depp is perfectly cast as a man whose loyalty to his family and his love for them has trapped him. And they are using him, and they don't appreciate him. His father disappeared. His older brother is gone. Gilbert has the responsibility. And he knows it. And he can't escape it.But it's hard, and when Becky comes along, she is something different. She is something he's never seen before. She isn't predictable, and she is striking. And she is smart and sensitive, like him.Don't answer the phone. Don't answer the door. This is a heartland masterpiece about real people living real lives, and director Lasse Halstrom (The Cider House Rules (1999) Chocolat (2000) after many Swedish films) doesn't flinch and he doesn't do clichés, and he gets it right.

47,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,An amazing movie about a guy trying to find his meaning in the world,10,16 January 2015,"The Grapes are a dysfunctional but nevertheless happy family, living in Endora, a small town ""where nothing ever happens and nothing ever will"" says Gilbert, who narrates the movie. Gilbert is the oldest son in the Grape family, and since his father committed suicide seventeen years ago Gilbert has become the man of the house, looking after his morbidly obese mom Bonnie and mentally challenged brother Arnie, while his two sisters pitch in to help whenever they can. Gilbert wants nothing more than to leave Endora's small town lifestyle, and when he meets Becky and her grandmother after their trailer breaks down near his house, his life changes, as does the rest of Endora. Chain stores like Foodland and Burger Barn start threatening the business of the grocery store where he works. Arnie's 18th birthday is coming up. Bonnie might actually leave the house after seven years, and Gilbert might end up a better person from his experiences.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an excellent drama, funny and sad all at once, without getting preachy or annoying. Johnny Depp isn't really an actor I'm a fan of, mainly because he's always playing the exact same gothy-emo roles in movies ever since Tim Burton had him acting in films, but Gilbert Grape is an exception, he was great in this role, not donning bad Halloween makeup as usual but instead playing a solemn, small-town guy trying to make sense of his life and the lives of those around him. However, the two best actors in the movie in my opinion were Darlene Cates (who played Bonnie Grape) and Leonardo DiCaprio (who played Arnie Grape). Darlene Cates, who is obese in reality as well, also does self-esteem and weight seminars at children's schools and the character Bonnie Grape points out that nobody who is obese ever asked to be obese, it comes with a lot of troubles but Bonnie is a very caring and loving mother and kid person regardless of her weight. It's sad to see how Gilbert loses his grocery boy job, and today many small town businesses are being shoved aside by Wal-Marts, Targets, Toys R' Us' and Starbucks, it's sad but it's true, the modern world is all disposable, and in the modern world people matter much less than profit.This is a movie everyone should get the chance to watch, it's definitely worth it.

48,Vomitron_G,The family that binds us,9,8 March 2006,"Truly, this is one beautiful movie. It doesn't go for cheap tears but in the end you must feel something, otherwise you simply don't have a heart. It's about a town, Endora, where nothing ever happens. In that town live the Grapes, a fatherless family that consists of a mother of elephant-like proportions, two sisters and two brothers (one of them being retarded).All the acting ranks from very good to excellent. Johnny Depp is so lovable as Gilbert Grape, the twenty-year-old son who tries to do good for everyone but doesn't know quite what he wants for himself yet. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply amazing as the retarded Arnie. He rightfully got an Oscar-nomination for his roll. At the time I saw this movie, I didn't know him yet, so at some moments I actually thought that he really could be a retarded actor (that's a big complement, isn't it?).The plot isn't too spectacular, but keeps you interested 'cause actually a lot of things do happen to certain character's in this sleepy town. A lot of things the characters say and do seem superficial, but actually aren't meaningless as they lead to other events in the story. And the arrival of Becky (Juliette Lewis) and her mother make things interesting for Gilbert. The ending is unexpected, very solid and sad. And then there's the little epilogue...This simply is a great movie: Good story, good acting, good directing. And that's all it takes.

49,Beta_Gallinger,"A decent drama with some good performances, even if it's not perfect",8,18 August 2009,"I was around back when this film was made in the early 90's, but was way too young to see it. I would have been old enough to see it years before I did, but I don't think I ever heard of it until 2006. That was when I first saw it. By then, I was familiar with Johnny Depp, as I had seen him in several other movies, and I knew he played the starring role in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". I was also reasonably familiar with Leonardo DiCaprio, who has a big part in this movie as well. I'm not exactly sure how high my expectations were for this film at the time, but I was blown away! It's been three years since then, and I've finally seen this critically acclaimed 1993 drama a second time. This time, I definitely wasn't blown away, but still thought it was good.Gilbert Grape is a young man who lives with his dysfunctional family in Endora, Iowa, a small town where nothing much ever happens. The father of the family is dead, and the mother, Bonnie, hasn't left the house in many years, which has made her morbidly obese. Gilbert's siblings in the family are his two sisters, Amy and Ellen, and his severely mentally handicapped younger brother, Arnie, who wasn't expected to live past the age of ten, but is now approaching his eighteenth birthday! Gilbert works at a local grocery store, which is being threatened by a new ""FoodLand"""" supermarket just out of town, and it is his responsibility to take care of Arnie, who often goes and climbs up the local water tower when left unsupervised. So, Gilbert doesn't have much time on his hands, which becomes a significant problem when he falls in love with Becky, who is currently stranded in Endora. This also leads to trouble with Betty Carver, an older married woman who has been having an affair with him.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Arnie has been praised to death, which I can understand. He's very convincing in this role, and if you watched the movie without knowing who the actor was, you could easily think he really was handicapped! He was nominated for an Oscar for this performance, and I don't think it would have been a bad thing if he had won. As usual, Johnny Depp also puts on a decent performance, and there are some other cast highlights, including Darlene Cates as Bonnie Grape (considering the fact that she had never been in a film before, and hasn't made many appearances since then), and John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover as Gilbert's friends, Tucker Van Dyke and Bobby McBurney. The characters, the conflict, Gilbert and Arnie's relationship, etc. keep the story interesting for the most part, and sometimes poignant. Now, the film also has flaws. There's some fairly weak dialogue at times, and Betty Carver, played by Mary Steenburgen, gets a little creepy. However, this doesn't completely ruin the film.I've never read the novel of the same name (upon which this movie is based), written by Peter Hedges, who also wrote the screenplay for this adaptation, but regardless, this movie is a well-crafted drama. I noticed some aspects of this movie which I didn't remember from my first viewing, which includes Gilbert's affair with Betty Carver, and how creepy she gets. I don't know how I could have possibly forgotten that from the first viewing, but I definitely won't forget it after my second, and it doesn't help. I also definitely wasn't as moved as I was the first time. On the other hand, my second viewing didn't change my opinion on most of the positive things I could remember from before, and I would still say it's a realistic story. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is a rather simple movie, and I'm sure many viewers would find it boring, but for the kind of film it is, they could have done slightly better, but they still did a pretty good job.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
50,KnightsofNi11,OK for a formula film...,6,25 November 2010,"Supporting the disabled is not easy. That burden is something that nobody can carry easily, and the only thing that can fuel perseverance to keep from being overwhelmed by this burden is love. Yet I'm sure anyone who has had to experience something like what we see in What's Eating Gilbert Grape can say that the pressures get very overwhelming and it makes it an extremely daunting task, making it very hard to stay sane. Johnny Depp does an excellent job in portraying these emotional tribulations through his character of Gilbert Grape. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is about a family of five. Gilbert is the oldest son who has two sisters and a mentally handicapped brother, Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), that he must constantly look after. The mother of the family is an equally heavy burden (no pun intended) because she is morbidly obese and in no way self sufficient. The film focuses on Gilbert's emotional hardships he must endure trying to support his family in the small rural town of Endora, Iowa. The story focuses heavily on family and doing whats ethical versus doing what's easiest. It's an interesting look into the human condition.Overall the film looks beautiful. The director obviously puts a lot of care into capturing such a deeply emotional story, and he paces his film fittingly. The film is very consistent, and this works throughout the film's entirety, but the minuscule variations in tone and pace drag the film down. The director does a nice job at showcasing the wide open rural setting the film is takes place in and he uses a lot of good country motifs to give the film its consistent mood. He no doubt shoots the film very well and makes the most out of what he is given.There are a number of big stars in this film, and they all do a good job. Johnny Depp carries the film very well and is plenty believable. The character of Gilbert Grape teeters on the line between angry and sympathetic about his brother Arnie. He even makes the statement at the beginning of the film, ""The doctor says Arnie could die any day. Some days you're glad Arnie's alive. Some days... you're not."" This line sets the stage for a lot of Gilberts polarizing attitudes that he has to fight through to keep his family safe. He is a character a lot of people can surely relate to, making the whole story much more personal for certain audiences. For me, I understood the challenge of Gilbert, but obviously couldn't connect at the same level as some people might.DiCaprio gets a lot of praise for his role as the severely mentally disabled Arnie Grape. I think that a lot of the acclamation he gets for this role is overrated. For the level at which DiCaprio plays his character, he does a good job. However, I wish Tropic Thunder could have come out about fifteen years earlier so that DiCaprio would have been enlightened by the infamous yet relevant phrase, ""you never go full retard."" I hate to say it, but DiCaprio went full retard. Like I said, for going full retard DiCaprio handled the role well, but the fact of the matter is you never go full retard. There were times where he definitely overdid it, and it was difficult to connect with such an out of touch character. The connection really falls to the people around him and how he affects them. The rest of the cast does a great job with what they're given though. Especially the beautiful shining Juliette Lewis, who seems to perfect every role she plays with a kind of sophistication that you don't see in younger actresses anymore.The storyline in What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of those story lines that makes for a great synopsis. A young man must support his family that consists of a mentally handicapped brother and morbidly obese mother in a small rural town. You can tell from that one sentence that this should be an emotional, uplifting, and probably tragic film. But when you drag it out into a two hour film, the results are much less extraordinary than what you were led to believe from the synopsis. Admittedly, not a lot happens in this film. It is a much stronger focus on the characters, which is not a problem, but here it seems to become monotonous and redundant after a while. The film develops very slowly and after a while we seem to see the same things over and over again. It's just one problem after another focusing around Arnie or their obese mother. But probably the most unfortunate thing about this story is that it becomes very formulaic. In the end it is a very predictable film that I've seen multiple times, just with different types of issues set in a different location. And to add insult to injury, I can't say this sort of genre appeals to me at all, so on a personal level it was already headed down a bad road.What's Eating Gilbert Grape has its highs and lows, but for what it is I can't say it's a bad movie. It's just not a great movie. It's not poorly made and there is a lot of obvious care put forth by the director and actors. They make the most out of what they have, which is fairly weak in some respects. I have too many issues with this film that keep me from loving it, but I certainly didn't hate it. I have to respect it for what it is, but it's definitely something I won't watch again.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Kudos for being far less melodramatic than it could have been.

WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is sporadically funny for an old town life story that centers along with growing pains that run in the family. The idea is placed on how to deal with helpless relatives, but somewhere along the line, the humor is gratifying and makes you interested. Johnny Depp is okay as a young guy who succumbs to all kinds of pressure while getting romanced by a customer he saw in the grocery store. He just needs more emotional value. Leonardo DiCaprio in his pre-TITANIC role as an 18-year old handicap is a show-stealer. A little bit of comedy relief is expected out of his annoying, magically spirited character who takes risks without sudden harm. Brilliant acting on his part.

55,moviesleuth2,Undeniable charm,9,4 May 2010,"This is a slight, yet undeniably charming film. For a movie with so much grief, it is actually rather heartwarming. A little too long, but it is still a wonderful film.Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) lives with his family in Endora, Iowa. It's a tiny town in the middle of nowhere with a population that would have trouble reaching the triple digits. Gilbert's family is in shambles; the father is dead, his mother is too obese to care for her children, and his brother, Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Therefore, Gilbert takes it upon himself to keep his family together. But then one day, a girl named Becky (Juliette Lewis) and her grandmother become stuck in Endora with a car that won't work. Gilbert and Becky fall for each other, but their romance just might damage the status quo that Gilbert has worked so hard to keep.There's really not much of a story in this film. It's all about the characters, and they are richly developed and superbly acted. Johnny Depp is known for his extraordinary versatility, and his penchant for playing off the wall characters (Jack Sparrow and Sweeney Todd, just to name a few). But Depp is quite effective in a subdued, low-key performance as Gilbert. Gilbert is a guy who does everything for everyone else, but nothing for himself. Only when Becky enters the picture does he begin to realize that he has his own wants and desires as well. His co-star, Juliette Lewis, is equally impressive as the flighty yet kind Becky. She's a free spirit, something that the tied-down Gilbert longs to be.The lion's share of the acting acclaim has to go to Leonardo DiCaprio. At age 19, DiCaprio gives the performance of a lifetime as Arnie. He portrays every facet of the character so well, that it is simply jaw-dropping to watch. From the excited squeals to the difficulty talking to the awkward hand movements, DiCaprio nails it, and had the film been released at another year, he would undoubtedly have won an Oscar for his performance (he did receive a nomination, however).Lasse Halstrom is an interesting director. His films are highly character-based, and all have a mixture of charm and sadness. Although it's not as deliciously warm as his later effort, ""Chocolat,"" it does have a warm, pleasant feeling that pervades the film.""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is a film that requires patience. Not much actually happens, but for those who can appreciate character over plot, this is an excellent choice.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

The first time I saw this movie was a couple years ago and I forgot a lot of scenes in the film so I wanted to see it fully. As I was switching through HBO two days ago, I saw the film as it started. You really couldn't lay your eyes off the movie. It was a truly wonderful and emotionally sad film with excellent performances. Johnny Depp did great and this was one of his first films that he got to play in and Leonardo DiCaprio played the best role in this film as the retarded brother, ""Arney."" He stole the movie. Overall, great film and I would bring some tissues by you because you might shed a tear. I highly recommend the film. Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

60,shark-43,"Offbeat, Touching Film",8,12 October 2002,"A touching little movie - it features an amazing performance by DiCaprio (which followed his powerful debut in This Boy's Life). Hallstrom the director does a wonderful job showing the small town - full of hope, nice people but also a suffocating desire to just stay put. Great dimension to the odd, quirky people that populate the town and Depp, Steenburgen and Reilly give nice performances. But the stunning work here is done by Leonardo who plays the mentally disabled brother, Arnie - his work is so honest and real and heartbreaking.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
61,CinematicInceptions,Emotional and more interesting than you might expect.,8,1 February 2016,"Initially, this movie would seem to be a pretty boring two hours. It doesn't have a terribly definitive external plot like people expect lots of movies to have. That's not to say that there's not a story there, but it's just not one that you could advertise well. Actually, one could make a case that it was spoofed by Napoleon Dynamite eleven years later since very little happens in either Midwestern town, but Endora is made laughable enough that there's nothing really to spoof.Gilbert seems a little bit like one of those characters who ""didn't exist before the movie"", but I think this is actually his Inactiveness. The quoted phrase above is typically used when critiquing how a character is written, but I think it actually holds true for Glibert as a person. We don't think he's existed prior to the events of the movie because he hasn't. He's just been content with his dead-end life and doesn't feel like making any change to it, not because he likes it, but because he's just never considered doing anything else. Throughout the story, we see him try to shed the burdens and responsibilities that his family has placed on him and begin to seek his own interests. His most prominent burden is his disabled brother Arnie. I get the feeling that if Arnie ever did die, Gilbert would then be able to handle practically any challenge that he faced for the rest of his life. Firstly, he would finally have the freedom to accept other responsibilities without having to worry about Arnie, and secondly he would have so much day-to-day experience with hardships and dealing with difficult people that other tasks would seem fairly easy to him. But all the same, Arnie's innocence makes him worth the workload and he provides emotional support for Gilbert like nobody else could. A less rewarding burden is Mrs. Grape, a lump of a woman who becomes the laughingstock of the town for her extreme obesity. The other two women in Gilbert's life are his adulterous lover Mrs. Carver and the out of town visitor Becky. Eventually, Becky's presence in his life makes Gilbert more aware of himself and helps him to bring his entire family to a better state of life (even in the form of Mrs. Grape's death). Mrs. Carver is probably the most hatable character (outside of maybe Ellen Grape) because of her poor parenting and how she takes advantage of Gilbert's problems. On the other hand, Becky is a breath of fresh air to everyone she meets, but you don't get the sense that she's a saint or anything. The acting was amazing all around. Obviously DiCaprio steals the show as Arnie, but the other actors deserve props as well. Johnny Depp didn't really have an opportunity here for a great performance, but he did well enough for the part he was in. The overall directing felt way ahead of its time. Without knowing the year, I would have guessed that this came out ten years later than it did. I especially liked the way the camera was positioned so that you were constantly aware of how much danger Arnie is in whenever he is in an elevated position. The script was pretty good with dialogue and the author did a good job adapting the screenplay; I could feel the care that was put into the action lines as they were performed on-screen. The score did a really good job capturing the mood of care-freeness when that was called for.As I said at the start, it might not seem that appealing, but I would encourage you to give it a try. It will most likely not be one of your favorite movies, but it will be a fairly enjoyable and enriching experience. I suppose if you like one of the actors featured, there's already some draw anyways. If that is the case, you will not be disappointed by DiCaprio, but know that it is a relatively low-key performance from Johnny Depp. Overall Rating: 8/10.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

64,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,One of the most depressing movies I've ever seen,7,1 July 2019,"Viewing this for the first time, in 2019, as a 34 year old, who was a 90's kid that grew up in the Midwest but now lives in Los Angeles, I can say that for me this was one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. I'd seen bits and pieces of it as a kid as it was constantly on cable TV, but I never watched it through, and now I understand why.Not only does the movie project severe melancholy in a traditional manner, through it's story, characters, and tone, but also now through it's representation of a long lost era in American film and simpler life on this planet. Towards the beginning of the film, you may find yourself reflecting upon earlier stages of your life as I did, when the pre-Internet world functioned in an entirely different manner. ""Going outside to play"" was the standard for kids, but in a sense, it was for adults too. As the movie begins, you may find yourself missing the ""ancient"" world and the archaic sort of way that we functioned and communicated just 25 years ago. You may have thoughts like ""Wow, maybe I should move to a small town, to get away from all this"". Then, you get 30-60 minutes into the movie, and you start to realize, it is certainly no better there. In fact, it's much, much worse. These characters are prisoners to their own upbringing. It just gets harder and harder to watch as you feel the weight of each of these character's existence getting heavier throughout the film.Our lead Depp plays an older brother so weighed down by his unfortunate family ties that he himself doesn't even have the chance to have a personality. He comes off as nice at first but eventually it reveals itself as cowardice. He's nice to look at but the character hardly allows him to do much acting. He is not a likable protagonist, and this makes the movie really rough. DiCaprio gives a stellar performance as the mentally handicapped younger brother Arnie but according to the doctors, he will die any day now. Adding to the roughness. It was nice to see some early roles by John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover, Juliette Lewis, etc - but there is no true relief from anyone in this film. The score is also reminiscent of what you would hear in your head when you're looking at old pictures of your dead grandma and grandpa - also rough. There's not much to do in the town of Endora - in fact, there's nothing to do at all. This leads to people betraying their family members in a multitude of ways. You want to like them, but you can't. It's all heavy, it's all dark, it's all sad.In the beginning, the film made me miss the days of feature films which were supported and developed with scripts that are arguably about nothing. Yes, things happen in this film, but overall, it's just a bunch of sad people in the middle of nowhere (small town Iowa) who don't have the opportunity to really do anything with their lives - and we are watching them rot slowly, or in some characters cases, rather quickly.Not only did this movie remind me why the current film industry depresses the heck out of me (movies with psychological value on a sincere, personal level rarely get real budgets anymore - it's all heartless, commercial franchise vomit) but it also hit me like a hammer in the face in a purely existential sense - a heavy reminder that life is miserable, most people are terrible, and we are all doomed. Glad I watched it but I'll probably never watch it again.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
65,aromatic-2,"Terrific Acting, interesting story, well-directed",9,12 April 2001,"Depp and DeCaprio lead off a top-notch cast from head to toe.

66,aromatic-2,Offbeat and sensitive slice-of-life,9,8 October 2001,"As one might expect, since this is directed by Lasse Hallstrom and stars Johnny Depp, What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a well-constructed, totally offbeat, gentle and sensitive movie. It gets us deep within the souls and the psyches of a family of apparent losers in a nowhere town. 
Surprisingly and upliftingly, we gradually become acquainted not only with the trials and tribulations of the somewhat pathetic characters, but about their basic dignities and the sources of their strengths to go on.  Almost needless to add about a Hallstrom movie, but the soundtrack and photography are both utterly exquisite.  Newcomer Darlene Cates was not a professional actress but an actual obese agoraphobe who gives a magnificent performance as Depp's mother.  Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Depp's retarded younger brother.  All the other cast members also give genuine and sensitive performance, another standout being Kevin Tighe as Mary Steenburgen's cuckolded husband who manages to drown in his children's wading pool!
I highly recommend this offbeat and charming movie.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
67,Cinema_Fan,Under every stone there's always something new to find.,9,25 February 2007,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a beautifully shot movie that is set amongst the fictional working class one street town of Endora. With its cynically renamed ENDora OF THE LINE Drug Store, the almost deserted dairy dreme ice cream parlour and the exceedingly unused Lamson's Grocery shop, life in Endora, Iowa and it population of just 1,901, is motionless.This is Gilbert Grape's story, and his recollection of what was to be just another ordinary and uneventful moment in the life of him, his family and his, almost sleepy, town. Centred around the Grape family, sisters Ellen and Amy and their two brothers Arnie and Gilbert, who, along with their widowed mother, morbidly obese Bonnie Grape are striving to survive and coexist with the absence of a father figure, low waged work and seventeen-year-old Arnie's severe mental condition.It is in this awkward and extremely one sided affair that the unfortunate sibling Gilbert (Johnny Depp) has to constantly watch over his younger brother Arnie, played to such depth and conviction by a very young Leonardo DiCaprio, while still holding down a job for Lamson's Groceries and looking after, also, their housebound mother. Gilbert's life, his future, his dreams is thwarted, he know this, but it is in this Guardian Angel that his love and bond for Arnie, and his family, cannot, and will not, be let go.That is until the free spirited Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives in town, and stranded with her grandmother for the week while waiting for parts for their vehicle. This realisation, this new fresh face unties new feelings, new thoughts and new hope for the put upon Gilbert, something new is eating Gilbert Grape.Iowa born Peter Hedges (b. 1962) novel has been turned into a fine work of emotional art, with the reassuring and delicate touch from Swedish director Lasse Hallström (b. 1942). While the dialogue is somewhat nondescript, but at the same time is never wasted on distractive trivialities, it is the inner core of the narrative that projects What's Eating Gilbert Grape as a tender and caring movie of self-sacrifice, devoted love and long full companionship.The cast here are all relatively young, a younger than nineteen looking DiCaprio and Lewis, with its much more than capable co-stars. This gifted young cast are individually exceptional and hold their qualities well; to the point that at times we are mistaken for thinking we are seeing more home video than movie. Rita Darlene Guthrie's (b. 1947) first acting role is astounding, her natural instinctive character, as mother Grape, protrudes more than we expect, as the backbone of this family, she holds together a family of highly individual children under one union, and their respect and love. We are also seeing their new and young lives unfold before us, and the inevitable hand of fate that both bad timing and misplaced destiny has dealt them.This movie ties us in with compassion and enlightenment through it main character Arnie, here we are given an insight into the daily responsibilities of this family toward his special needs. DiCaprio excels himself as the much loved youngster whose unintentional care-free and more than often care-less mind can at times bring domestic harmonies to boiling point and, sadly, beyond breaking point, even for the closest of families. Often surprising, often enduring but always touching.This is perpetuated by the music of soft acoustic guitar that plays on the musical heartstrings for this gentle love story and with the work of the late Sven Nykvist (1922 - 2006) as its Swedish cinematographer, illuminating both the beauty of the surroundings and the bleak realities. We are also shown, subconsciously, that there is nothing wrong in being poor and that being from the side where the grass is not so green is not too bad after all, with just the right amount of stable influences that can support anyone through the hardships of life, most thing's can happen. This has been proved by the photograph of the third Grape brother seen on the fridge door, and the families pride in him gaining a University Degree, and ultimately, starting a new life outside of Endora. The subplot, though minor, is still a harsh reminder that even the best of people can become too isolated, too familiar in their lives. Mary Steenburgen's middle-aged Betty Carver has a nice family, a nice house and a nice middle-aged husband, but is still not happy. Her affair with Gilbert is just a fleeting glimpse into the perspective of human companionship gone sour between old love.Leonardo DiCaprio lost out to Tommy Lee Jones for his part as repetitive Marshal Samuel Gerard in The Fugitive (1993) at the 1994 Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Losing out to such an uninspiring role did not harm his winning the 1994 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards for Most Promising Actor as well as National Board of Review 1993 Award for Best Supporting Actor. With just three years after Edward Scissorhands (1990) and a year before Ed Wood (1994) this little movie proves that Mr. Depp can still take chances and win, and with Gilbert Grape, he has succeeded in proving versatility, depth and charm.Endora may be broken and beat, but it does not mean that it is dead, there is still hope, with the arrival of the new Burger Barn to enlighten the town's folk spirit, like the two young buds of love, enlightenment can stop at the most peculiar of places.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

69,karlericsson,Hallström's American My Life As a Dog,9,4 August 2012,"This film is about many things but one of them is fatness. It does not cover the enormity (no pun intended) of the tragic being fat but it does more than most films, who all seriously suggest that the people being fat somehow want to be fat and that they just had to eat a little less in order to loose weight - not a word about the fact that many copiously fat people die while dieting, because they have to go so far in dieting before anything happens.Instead you have all these movies and ""science"" about the poor alcoholics. If alcoholism to 90% is an affliction that punishes the surroundings of a person and to a far lesser extent the person itself, who (if he does not belong to the unfortunate 10 %) can live to a very ripe age indeed, then the abuse of food is an affliction that punishes the person itself but not his surroundings. Alcoholism is aggression turned outwards and food-abuse aggression turned inwards.In alcoholism there mustn't be any melancholia involved - usually it's just about an extremely selfish person who gives a hooting hell about other people. In food-abuse and extreme fatness there is always deep melancholia involved, which however is seldom played out against the surroundings.Now, alcoholism as other drug abuse, is the abuse of the rich and powerful - hence all the sentimentality about it.Food-abuse is usually the abuse of the poor, who try to get along in impossible situations. Food-abusers get ridiculed just like the poor always get ridiculed and abused by the rich.If a fat person is too fat to be operated upon, he is allowed to go to a resort, paid for by the state, where his or her weight is reduced to just the weight that the operating table can carry. He could go on in the resort not needing the operation at all but since that would mean that he would probably have to return to the resort every 5 years or so, this is considered far too expensive. Society rather cripples the person by removing guts than truly help him.We will still have to wait for a truly fair film about fatness but this film is definitely a step in the right direction and Johnny Depp was never better than in this movie.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

But it will also make you feel good that life can be a triumph over tragedy rather than just succumbing to it. A must see for DiCaprio who does an incredible job as a handicapped teen, full of life & love but never cloying or pitiful. But Johnny Depp also does an outstanding job as a young man on the verge of life and at the same time terrified of it.And when all is said & done, ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" is a hunger for life & love for himself & those he loves.

I don't ever want to forget this performance, and that's what it is. It's not an ""unforgettable"" performance, no, it's deeper than that; it's a performance you just don't want to forget. An absolutely breathtaking performance that finally got its Oscar 22 years later.What's Eating Gilbert Grape has 2 characters who are over-the-top lovable, surrounded by other characters who were at varying levels of intense likability, on top of a story so absorbing and enthralling.

It had me at 5 minutes, to a point where even then, I felt as if it was already too close to the end, even though there was another 112 minutes to go. It's a film that took its time, and allowed you to fall in love with some characters without forcing it to happen.I'd love to give this film more than 8/10, however I had some minor issues. 1. I really wanted to know what happens with Tucker and his Burger Barn craze. That really interested me. 2. The title of the film wasn't given enough time to breathe. Sure Gilbert had a lot on his mind, but what was eating him surely, was his mother, and that reveal wasn't given the full attention it deserved, especially because it's a legitimate concern. 3. The editing could've been better.Alright, the ""tearing down"" is over, now back to how amazing this film was. The characters; Arnie, Bonnie, Amy, Tucker, Betty, Ellen, etc. The story, the performances; Leonardo DiCaprio, Darlene Cates, Laura Harrington, etc. Some stunning work was done in this film, to a point where you even wonder if there is some deliberate irony in Bonnie loving Arnie so much, and not wanting him to disappear, meanwhile Arnie's favourite game is; ""Where is Arnie"", then to later have Bonnie, disappear on him, and them all. 8.4/10.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
74,illbebackreviews,A young Leonardo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp bring to us one of the most underrated classics of all time!,9,19 January 2013,"This film certainly suits the description of being an underrated, forgotten classic! As school is about to start soon, one of our curricular assessments is based on the film so I went in, expecting a very disappointing and boring movie. What I eventually got was something that was funny, exciting and emotional that I didn't know would EVER happen! The biggest strength in this movie, to me, is undeniably its GREAT acting! The star of the movie, as many would say, is definitely a young Leonardo DiCaprio would unfortunately would not get the Oscar as Liam Neeson wins if for Schindler's List. Its unfortunate that this movie came out in the same year that the Winner of 7 Academy Awards, Schindler's List came out in. Johnny Depp himself is absolutely brilliant playing the family supporting brother who perfectly illustrates his character.The story never slows down. Its a fast paced drama from start to finish filled with much humor and emotion. The greatest thing about it all is that we personally care for all the characters in this film. The character I most cared about in this film was not Arnie or Gilbert, it was their obese mother, Bonnie. I found her the character I could feel for the most, imagining if the same had actually happened to my mother, how I would feel.Something I also love in this film is that despite a lot of humorous moments, the movie NEVER fails to fall out of its tone. The whole way through we care about these characters and find it so emotional when things to do eventually go wrong.The ending of the film was so powerful that if this film were to be brought back into cinemas, the final scene alone is worth the price of admission.For any who have not checked out this film, it certainly is a classical, underrated movie that is sure to leave you in tears for a good 120 minutes!",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

What's Eating Gilbert Grape is able to take an idea so simplistic and familiar yet, somehow, make it feel like a highly educating monument. Nowadays, tons of dramas try to be way too serious/far-reaching or profoundly groundbreaking. This shows me that filmmakers have lost awareness of the fact that even the smallest of plot-lines can make some of the most compelling and indelible of films. I think this is one of the central reasons why I felt so attracted to this movie. It was a reminder of family-importance and self-intention, and how that can play personally into your life. It's about how all of the pressure you are weighted with from family duties and burdens can make you become aware of the merit that you are gifted with, but also the expansion it gives you when you put forth discovering new aspects of the world. Sometimes-based off a truth-once you find the flaws within your loved ones, then, and only then, can you finally learn to appreciate them.

I won't discuss the plot, except to say that it was low-key, motivated and (most important) believable. Despite the title, the film is not a wacky comedy, and I would not call it particularly light-hearted. Some very serious ideas were presented without the trappings of drama.The acting was remarkable, especially for being so understated. Darlene Cates gave a very brave performance, especially in light of the fact that she was not cast for her acting abilities. Leonardo DiCaprio has never given a better performance. Some critics referred to his character as being lovable. No, not at all. The character is obviously child-like, but an extreme amount of patience was required in dealing with this adult child, and that was a major theme of this film. DiCaprio put this across with no apparent effort, and there was not a glimpse of the actor asking for audience approval.After seeing DiCaprio in this film, I was rather dismayed when he subsequently got into his ""teen idol"" phase, which TG was just a phase.

His younger brother, Arnie Grape, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He gives a genius performance at his young age of a retarded boy who is engaging and endearing to the viewer. One is fooled by his perfect act to think that he is genuinely a patient with cerebral palsy. Their mother is morbidly obese and barely able to walk because of her extreme size. She attracts empathy from the audience and also gives a convincing performance.

83,emilie8605,"original last name, huh?",8,17 November 2003,"what a sad sad movie. i dont know what made me feel worse, the fact that gilbert has to watch his overweight mom and his mentally retarded brother, or if he would ever get his life together for himself and eventually become something to society.  leo dicaprio does a nice job being retarded and had some funny and sad moments.  johnny does a nice job too for being able to not crack a smile when leo is being serious about being retarted.  johnny also appeared to me to look like matt from 7th heaven with the hairdo... its a good thing that gilbert meets Juliette Louis and can have a girlfriend. i thought he derserved it!  it kinda makes you think what you would do if you were gilbert, at least thats how i perceived it.

84,kylehodgdon,Great Heart,8,11 November 2009,"This film is truly a great watch and has great heart. The story is very compassionate and, for the most part, leaves you feeling with a renewed faith in people.One small downfall is how slow the movie begins. I'm not saying that I was looking for some great action sequence to start the movie off, but things really don't pick up until the half hour mark or so.Thinking back on this film, I really think that Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors. Even back when he was very young he did a fantastic job in his role. All other characters were either perfect or close to it. Not only are the actors great in their roles, but the characters all really hold the viewers attention. This movie has a great plot and forces you to give your heart to the characters. It is a very sweet movie. Highly recommended.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

86,emryse,A Slow Tender Film,8,6 August 2021,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a slow, tender, heartfelt character study of a family living in rural America. Every member of the cast puts in brilliant performances with the stand out being Leonardo Di Caprio who even at that young age was showing off his amazing talent and steals the spotlight in every scene he's in. Johnny Depp also gives a soulful, quieter performance that perfectly contrasts Leo's brashness. The technical aspects of this film are all fine but the whole movie is really carried by Di Caprio and Depp's performances. A great film even if it may be too slow for some, still I would heartily recommend it.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
87,stefstars,Johnny and Leo Give Great Performances,9,4 May 2021,"This movie is as old as I am, so I have a valid excuse for not having seen it all these years. I think this movie is actually a perfect depiction of the time it came out in. Johnny Depp plays the titular character, Gilbert Grape, a character who definitely embodies the angst of the grunge generation without the grunge culture tropes or other extremities a lot of coming of age movies from the 90s had. This one is more relatable, as the character is limited by the world around him, he knows he could run away from it all at any time but he loves his family too much to even do that. A scene that proves that is when the character Becky asks him what he wants and the first things he thinks about is what he'd want for his loved ones with his own wish, of being a good person, being last. Gilbert puts everyone and everything else before his own wants and needs and he wonders if he's wrong for wanting something different, a mental quarrel I think many of us find ourselves having when we reach a certain age, particularly when we haven't grown up in the best of circumstances. I think this film beautifully captures that without having to exaggerate or have Gilbert say annoyingly angsty lines.Johnny Depp does a wonderful job portraying Gilbert. He was definitely a perfect casting. His expressive face is what helps express the angst and inner turmoil this character is facing. His delivery is fantastic and his subtle demeanor perfectly embodies the idea of this character. Leonardo DiCaprio as Arnie is just unbelievably good. That is not an easy role to play and Leo conquered it. This is another aspect of the movie that wasn't exaggerated, Leo plays his severely autistic character in a really natural matter. Nowadays, this kind of casting would not be accepted and would be cancelled to heck, but it's good that this film came out when it did. We can look back at this and see how Leo DiCaprio is a talent that was way overdue for his Oscar. He should have gotten an Oscar for this performance and Johnny should have gotten some recognition for his performance too.The setting works perfectly with the story being told. Every shot properly adds to the mood and tone of the story, especially Gilbert's emotions and state of mind. It's not the prettiest of landscapes but the plainness matches the whole movie well. I recommend giving this film a watch because it truly is a classic and Johnny and Leo's performances definitely need to be appreciated for many more years to come.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
88,vishal_wall,watch it for film and actors,9,25 July 2006,"In a small town Gilbert Grape works as delivery man in a little store. He has two sisters, a younger brother and his mom. Mom is very fat and younger brother Arnie is mentally ill. Movie doesn't have a specific storyline to write about. Still there is so much in the film to watch. There are 4 tracks and every track has Gilbert in the center. Gilbert Grape is an interesting film about people who have responsibilities on their shoulders and how they don't even realize that they are living a mechanical life. Juliette lewis meets Gilbert as a traveler. Its a nice angle as Gilbert realizes through her what he is missing in life. He realizes his submission to everything is taken for granted. Its a very good movie and very entertaining too. Gilbert's fat mom's angle is fantastic and very novel. 'Food land' track looks out of place but jells in perfect by the end of the film. Pace of the film looks slow but its actually very fast. All the tracks are very interesting and well done.Johnny Depp as Gilbert Grape does a very good job. Caprio is unbelievably good. You just cant believe that he is not mentally retarded. I think I am becoming a big Caprio fan now. I liked him a lot in 'Catch me..' and 'Man in the Iron mask'. In this film he has proved that he is a gifted actor and deserves all the stardom he has. watch it for the film and actors. Johnny Depp and Caprio what else can you look for?",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
89,Travis_Bickle01,Everyone should be a bit more like Gilbert Grape...,9,26 March 2005,"""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" is the unique story of a young man who just wants to be a good person. Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance and Leonardo Dicaprio is amazing, unbelievable, outstanding,... as the retarded Arnie. It's hard to describe his performance, you just have to see it. I think it's one of the best performances of a retarded kid ever. He definitely should have won the Oscar, instead of Tommy Lee Jones. Also Juliette Lewis gives a truly remarkable performance as the vulnerable Becky.There are also many heartbreaking moments in this movie, but I will only mention the ones who where the most special to be. The scene where the mother goes to the police office herself to get her son, was really moving. When she returns to the car and all the people are staring at here, children are laughing, there's even a guy who's taking a picture... when I saw this I could only feel very sorry for her. Another great scene is when they put the house on fire when their mother died. The meaning of that is very beautiful and sad at the same time: it's the only way her funeral can be a bit respectful and she won't be seen as a joke (it's literally what she said she wanted) I'm a big fan of Lasse Hallström. Every time he makes a movie, he succeeds in delivering a wonderful a touching piece of art with actors who give the best of them. This movie isn't an exception, it is as beautiful as ""The Cider House Rules"", ""Chocolat"" and ""The Shipping News"".Wonderful story, great acting,...what more should a movie have? Excellent movie, a must see for everyone who isn't afraid of feeling something... 9/10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
90,wrightiswright,My Review,7,15 June 2019,"What a lovely film! Before he became irritatingly omnipresent in the movies, Johnny Depp impresses as the titular character who's forced to take care (along with his sisters) of his morbidly obese mother who hasn't left their house in years and mentally disabled brother (played by Leonardo Dicaprio in another promising early performance) who's always getting himself into trouble.Gilbert desperately wants to leave his small town behind, but as long as he has these twin responsibilities, he's pretty much trapped where he is... until a girl on a bike (Juliette Lewis) rides in one day, and things will never be the same again. Mwhahaha.Reminding me of another film by Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom called 'My Life As A Dog', this one is similarly set in a small community where everyone knows each other. There isn't a lot of drama here, but who needs it when the characters and the plot are this charmingly authentic?Gilbert's struggles in his personal and private life are endlessly watchable, especially his relationship with his dysfunctional brother Artie which forms most of the emotional fulcrum. It's moving, funny in places, and just an all-round pleasurable viewing experience. Now who could ask for more than that? 7/10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

It's heart-warming, tender, real and gentle on the senses. Johnny and Leonardo put in their best screen performances ever. This is a slow moving story - but don't mistake that for boring. It keeps you engaged at all times. The family relationships and sibling rivalries are well portrayed and very realistic. This is a movie that can appeal to all ages. The ending is a little surprising, but after some thought, is the most perfect way to finish! I have nothing but praise for this gem of a movie. If you want a story to move you, then this is definitely one to watch.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

This one is a typical ""piece-of-life."" There's not much going on in the story but you become emotionally entangled with every single detail on the screen. And you can't help but ask yourself every now and then ""what if that were me?!!"" The movie lays thousands of possibilities ahead and makes you rethink your life and your attitude. Mr. Depp was amazing as usual.. but his performance is nothing compared with the EXCEPTIONAL performance of Leonardo DiCaprio who played Depp's retarded brother Arnie; a performance that deserves an Oscar and a heartfelt applause!

It is in a beautiful country setting,of a poor family,its aimed especially at one character Gilbert Grape,who has to look after his retarted brother Arnie (Dicaprio) and his obese mother. The acting was magnificant by each and every one of the cast members,especially Dicaprio.The story was different and heart warming,it really makes you break down,get a box of tissues ready,i really feel sorry for Gilbert.This film is one of my all time favourites,and will always remain it.I rated this splendid film 8.5 out of 10****1/2 / *****",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
94,tanelteder,even mentally unstable can win,8,9 January 2011,"One of the best from Lasse Halström. A very good drama with a good cast. It has a little bit of everything. A troubled guy, mentally ill guy, unspoken problem, different issues in family, happy moments, love story, some intense scenes etc. I think the title of the film is perfect. I was focused when I saw this film but I still got the answer at the end of the film. And it gave a good emotion.Leonardo DiCaprio (Arnie Grape) is a very talented actor. It is actually questionable whether he is like that whom he is so called playing or he truly plays. Well, history has shown that he still just played and he did it brilliantly. What concerns about Johnny Depp (Gilbert Grape), then it's somewhat unbelievable. Is there really a association of similarity between Gilbert Grape and captain Jack Sparrow?

95,muons,"Sorry folks, the emperor is bare naked...",4,3 June 2019,"The movie is interesting in its own peculiar way in the first 45 min or so. In the absence of a strong plot, it gets by with the help of its strong cast and decent acting which somehow keep you engaged without a gripping story. Then, it goes into a repetitive mode with a crawling pace and ends with a pathetic finale. I agree with other reviewers that Leonardo is very good in acting a retarded kid but his is only a one dimensional role where he twitches and fidgets the same way during the two longest hours you could experience. Juliette Lewis is supposed to be a wise and intriguing girl who attracts Gilbert at first sight. Her character, however, is utterly weird and vapid with her bizarre boyish look. The relation between Gilbert and Becky is sterile and contrived. A banal story, strong cast, good acting, feeble plot and a directorial disaster are the keywords for this snoozefest.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
96,eddiez61,It Helped Me See my Girlfriend as a Human Being,9,9 April 2010,"When I first saw this movie in 1995 I had a girlfriend with whom I disagreed about almost everything. I liked Sade, she idolized Madonna. I worshiped sunlight, she kept her apartment like a bat cave. I loved pizza with anchovies, she'd call me a pussy wimp. One day she recommended we rent this movie because she had already seen it and said it was the best movie she had seen since ""Gone With The Wind."" And so I thought to myself out loud ""Sounds like two hours of pure torture."" Since it was her turn to pick the movie for the night, and that's the kind of wonderful guy I am, we got it. Also, I figured during her favorite movie would be a really cool time to break up. After five minutes I was fascinated by the slow, gentle pace and sparse, effective dialog. Hey, I thought, what gives? She hated ""Apocalypse Now"" and fell asleep during ""FrankenHooker."" She had crap taste in movies, but this one was actually kinda good. I was sure the person playing Arnie was actually mentally handicapped but doing a very good acting job. Then I realized that it was all acting, not a retarded actor. Wow, very impressive. And the story just got better and better, all the details and moments contributing to the theme and mood. Nothing was gratuitous, it just kept getting deeper and broader.I just watched it again, and 15 years of aging has only made it better. It's even more relevant today, with it's mediation on the ""simple"" life and exploration of the values that hold families, communities and individuals together. The ""self"" is just a reflection, a part of something much bigger and greater than any one single person. Even if we don't like or appreciate or understand other people's place in the world, we all have the same worth. Even the town mortician, played by the always sublime Crispin Glover, who ghoulishly awaits the next death, is essential and equal. And of course, the repulsively overweight, near helpless mother is somehow made a sympathetic soul.Johnny Depp is solid and, in spite of his limited, almost monotone vocal range (compare him to Leonardo's great range), is a very compelling screen presence. Juliette Lewis has since made a career for herself playing more extreme, unusual characters but here she is so understated and fascinating to watch. I was cheering for the two of them to hook up.So, I suppose you might be guessing that this movie proved to me what a wonderful, magical person my girlfriend truly was. That our endless differences were only trivial and meaningless in the face of the vast expanse of genuine humanity that we shared; a truth rendered undeniable by our mutual adoration of this profoundly touching film. Uh, yeah. Let's just say that that loony, wacko freak for once in her chaotic, ridiculous life got something right. See how I've taken this movie's message to heart and can now look back on those horrendous nightmare days with fond affection. I'm sure that twisted goblin is doing the same.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a perfect step into Hollywood for the amazing Swedish film maker, and he shows a total understanding of the simplicity and relation to the Americana style and country side small town life, just equal to what he already had shown in his Swedish film ""My Life As A Dog"" from 1985.

There is something very special about this film.I think I love the way it shows the contrast between freedom and bondage of responsibility. You can feel the sense of freedom in the landscape, in the horizon, in the sunset, on the country road. Gilbert is surrounded by all of this scenery of freedom but he has to carry on his shoulder the responsibility of an obese mother and a retarded brother. You can 'feel' the sense of longing in him, you can feel how much he wants to be free. However, Gilbert chooses to do the right thing. He doesn't run away from all of these responsibilities and just get himself out of the boring town. And in the end, freedom comes to him, at the right time. The ending is such a very, very beautiful ending.I love the cinematography. All the pictures in the film somehow sing and speak their own language. I love the acting of Jonhny Depp and Leonardo Dicaprio. They just simply be Gilbert and Arnie perfectly. I love the story very, very much. Every little detail matters. I love the way everything is such a perfect combination, a simple story that is delivered beautifully.This is a movie that I can never forget.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
106,nightwishouge,So nostalgic it makes my heart hurt,10,3 February 2019,"I have to admit there is no way for me to be objective about a movie like What's Eating Gilbert Grape. I grew up in the southern suburbs of Chicago, and we regularly visited relatives in more rural areas of the MIdwest. It was pretty rare that I wound up anywhere quite so isolated and quaint as Endora (though my hometown of Plainfield, IL was apparently little more than a dirt road and a supermarket five years before we moved there, according to my friends who'd been there all their lives), but I recognize the small town atmosphere captured in Gilbert Grape. I have to admit it makes me nostalgic. There's no condescension or patronizing air about Lasse Hallstrom's direction. The movie seems to have a legitimate affection for the colorful characters and the beautiful scenery, but at the same time it pulls no punches in helping you understand why the title character feels he will go crazy if he doesn't leave Endora soon and see the rest of the world.I remember watching this movie pretty often when it came on TV in the mid-90s, and rewatching it now takes me back to the time and energy and pop culture of that period, when I was still a preteen. Everything about What's Eating Gilbert Grape--the cast, the cinematography, the attitude, of course the clothing and hair--feels so quintessentially '90s in a way I can't quite describe. If you watch this as a double feature with another Johnny Depp movie, Benny and Joon, I suspect you might actually go back in time.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
107,AndrewPhillips,Magic,9,10 June 2006,"The story of a family, in a back water town, where we get to see each of them struggling with life. Johnny Depp, him again, gives yet another excellent performance as Gilbert, frustrated with his lot, wishing he could get away from his family, responsibilities and most of all Endora. He works to support his family, is having a less than fulfilling affair with an older married woman and is always looking out for his brother Arnie, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, but more of him later. Depp manages to capture every emotion perfectly, in an non-showy role he pulls you in and makes you believe.Ultimately this is a simple story, man struggles then finds love, but it's so much more, the relationships of the family Grape are very well observed, from the mother hugely overweight, causing the structure of the house to crumble to the growing pains of the sisters. Where this story strikes gold is with Arnie, I remember when I first saw this film I had no idea who Di Caprio was, I actually thought they had used a disabled actor to play the part, when watching that year's Oscars and seeing him nominated for the role I was amazed. I have watched many films, and his performance is one of the best I have ever seen. Remarkable in it's accuracy and so moving, when we find him sitting in cold bath water having been told not to move hours earlier, well it breaks your heart, and Gilbert's rage demonstrating his frustration not really at Arnie but at life, just brilliant.So this is a film that you should see, if only for Di Caprio, but it has much more than that.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
108,zaenkney,Gilbert's burdens press him to a valued vintage!,10,23 October 2010,"""In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage."" The Grapes of WrathEach time I watch Gilbert Grape I am transported in memory to the small town in which I was raised on the Western border of the panhandle of Idaho, population: pert near 90; almost all related one way or another. My uncle, four years younger than I, was diagnosed with several physical anomalies shortly after birth. Within a year or two, it became apparent that he was learning disabled. He tolerated several surgeries on his eyes and legs, and having seven older siblings giving him all kinds of attention, he thrived. Our small town became his little sovereign nation, of sorts, as did the Grape family and their house in the country. A sort of soft isolation which protects and nurtures can be a great defense for a while, at least. Eventually, though, the outside world must be allowed its chance to either toughen us up or do its damage. Arnie, Gilbert's affected brother, played brilliantly by Leo DiCaprio, and their mother each have issues away from the safety of home. Bonnie, having eaten herself to enormity after her husband abandons the family, so to speak, finds it very difficult both physically and emotionally to leave her house. Arnie, on the other hand, loves to take off with Gilbert whenever possible or flee into town and climb the water tower at will, regardless of consequences. Then, there is sister Ellen, a handful, who also lives at home. This leaves Gilbert, a teenager, toting a bulging load. Relief comes in the form of Becky, Juliette Lewis, who befriends Gilbert and becomes a conduit, bringing hope and dreams back to life for him. This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. The power behind this picture is in the alchemic synergy of Johnny Depp and Leo DiCaprio so closely paired in this great project. So many viewers have lauded DiCaprio for the genius he brought to his role, but without Depp's unique talent to receive and react...I don't know. To sum it all up, as Gilbert puts a bandage on Arnie, he asks him, ""And why am I going to make it better?"" Arnie replies, ""Cause you are Gilbert."" ""Cause I am Gilbert,"" his brother reassures.

I have to say that this movie is unexpected because it does not have the elements of what I usually enjoy in movies (adventure, action, dramatic romance etc.). The story is simple. Everything about this movie is beyond simple, but it works because the performances from Johnny Depp and Leo (especially Leo) carries this movie. I cannot believe Leo did not win an Oscar for his role, Arnie. I have seen the Fugitive and I love Tommy Lee Jones, but I believe Leo deserved this Oscar. I, always, was outraged that he never won an Oscar, but now I truly understand how upsetting it is for him to not win the Oscars. He puts his everything in his performances. I love the brotherly bond of Gilbert and Arnie. It truly warmed my heart to see Gilbert take care of Arnie the way he did. The ending was so touching.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
110,ivony,The award belongs to DiCaprio in this one...,7,10 June 2003,"Let me start off by saying I am not a very big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. The majority of the movies he's made have been sub-par and he tends to rely on his seemingly ""bad-boy hearthrob"" image through most of his movies (gag). However, in Gilbert Grape we saw the very essence of DiCaprio's talent and if it weren't for him, I daresay this movie would not be worth watching.  In fact, for me, the *only* reason I continued to watch was because I was drawn to his character.Some people believe it is easy to play a ""mentally deficient"" person.  I disagree.  Actors run the risk of appearing as if they are merely making fun of a mentally challenged person rather than depicting one.  Often times, the portrayal is a complete flop, leaving the viewer disgusted and annoyed (I am Sam).  Such is not the case for DiCaprio's ""Arnie"" in Gilbert Grape.  Having worked with the disabled for over 10 years, I have to say his portrayal was on the spot and certainly not overdone.  From the constant repitition of various phrases, the contorting of his fingers, to the throaty, squeaky laugh, DiCaprio hits the nail square on the head.  So you might be wondering why this seems like a DiCaprio review rather than a Gilbert Grape review.  Basically, that's what this movie turns into...a DiCaprio film...because the viewer can't help but to totally focus on his character and set aside all the others.But, since this is supposed to be about the film itself, here goes: Johnny Depp was extremely flat throughout this film, citing lines with the utmost of monotony.  Darlene Cates (although not really an actress, just a pick from a daytime talk tv show) was really only picked due to her size since the few lines she had were so poorly acted.  Personally, I find that insulting: To only be picked for a movie *because* you are obese.  Juliette Lewis is her typical self and although I like most of her work, in Gilbert Grape she just appears ""typical"".  The storyline could have been compelling enough but the deep points of the movie were never really captured, nor expanded upon; leaving the movie to be another run-of-the-mill, tug-on-the-heartstrings big budgeted movie that was meant to be made for tv. So, we get back to DiCaprio who really was the only ""big budget"" performance of the bunch.If you're suffering from insomnia, it's 1am and this movie happens to be playing, then watch it.  Or if you're interested in single performances rather than the movie as a whole, then watch this one...you'll enjoy the scenes with Arnie.

112,SHAWFAN,One of the greatest films ever made,10,6 September 2005,"I was touched and pleased to read part (I couldn't get through them all) of a tidal wave of approving comments about this film on your website. The huge number of fans in so many countries who loved this movie for all the right reasons says a lot of good things about your fan base. No use repeating all their summaries and comments; almost all of the reviewers could see how great this movie is. But to add mine to the chorus: never has Leonardo di Caprio exceeded the acting artistry he brought to this film. The pathos and warmth all the actors and actresses brought to their roles and the very unique qualities of the roles themselves make this a movie like no other. The incredible operatic ending (the secret of which too many of your commentators let out) must be somewhere to unique in films. It's hard to believe that this stunning and wonderful picture went nowhere at the box office. No doubt its odd and strange title added to its non-acceptance. You'd have to go back to The Grapes of Wrath (1939)(another ""grape"" movie) to find another movie that pulls at your heart like this one does. Into the list of the greatest films ever made goes this one.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Arnie listened to Gilbert sings with the megaphone. In fact. I love this movie with two guys are. It was wonderful. While, Arnie was arrested before his mother wants her son back. Sometimes, things pretty funny. Depp and DiCaprio are friends for each other for the actors. I watched the scene of trailers where Gilbert and Arnie rides on Becky's trailer. It was the happy ending of the movie. Depp and DiCaprio looks so brilliant. I can discuss them for the movie from 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' back in 1990s. Depp and DiCaprio made it up their minds. I was happy to be the movie. And I love it. Now, if you don't mind, I've got work to do. Thank you so much.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
114,Camelot_2000,A Perfect Portrayal Of People Who Aren't Perfect,10,3 June 2015,"Not everybody is ""normal"". There are those who don't have the perfect physique and are too skinny or way too fat or are mentally challenged. This movie gives an excellent depiction of how difficult not being ""normal"" really is. It clearly shows how one's physical or mental state can lead to a lot of ridicule and eyeballing in society. It shows that ""hiding"" for some is the only alternative to take.Johnny Depp's extreme acting talent is evidently showcased here and as one IMDb reviewer said, he's capable of ""acting with his eyes"" which is totally true. He gives an excellent performance as the young man yearning to escape from a small, no-where town, but is trapped by the burden of his family.Darlene Cates is outstanding as the extremely overweight momma who sits on the couch all day and watches TV. As a non-professional actor who got the part because of her girth, she has excellent ""screen presence"" like the other acting professionals around her. Since her character's situation mirrored her own life, you can tell she's acting from sincerity and understanding.Leonardo Dicaprio is, of course, outstanding as the mentally challenged son who can behead a grasshopper at the mailbox and later cry about it. His happy, wild curiosity about the world and his habit for ""hiding up a tree"", not to mention his urge to climb the town's water tower, is a very believable performance. No wonder he was nominated for an Oscar.Juliette Lewis was perfectly cast as the down-to-earth and common-sense minded love interest to Gilbert who believes that appearances are ""external"" and that no one should be judged by that. The moment when she finally meets Gilbert's mom was a touching one indeed.This is a very beautiful, heartwarming movie and the beauty isn't in what is depicted, but in those who depicted it. Being ""normal"" isn't always the case for some and this movie perfectly shows that. I highly recommend it.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

The movie follows the daily life of an unhappy young man by the name of Gilbert who is dealing with caring for an autistic younger brother and a morbidly obese mother. This is a film that I believe everyone should see because it gives you a must greater respect for obese people and for caretakers in general. The acting is top-notch with an exceptional performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as the autistic boy.

119,dflynch215,American film with an aura of Sweden,9,1 March 2020,"It's not hard to imagine a film about a dysfunctional Texas family. However, What's Eating Gilbert Grape actually is a good example of Swedish cinema superiority. Director Lasse Hallstrom (My Life As A Dog) and cinematographer Sven Nykvist (Cries And Whispers) bring into being a notable American film that offers the melancholic essence of Swedish moral intricacy along with Scandinavian familial complexity. Swedish films often deal with families who are out of step with their communities. The Grape family of Texas surely is at odds with theirs. The cast is wonderful. Leonardo DiCaprio deserved his Academy Award nomination as Arnie Grape. What's Eating Gilbert Grape would be a good movie for film students to study.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
120,BeccaGudd,Heartfelt and touching,9,4 February 2017,I've seen this movie many times and it always touches my heart. It does have slow parts in it but the movie overall is amazing. The film tells the story of the Grape family including the youngest member Arnie who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Arnie is mentally disabled. They live in a rural town where the population is small and there isn't much to do for people. Gilbert played by Johnny Depp looks after Gilbert because their sisters must look after their morbidly obese Mother. The film shows how Gilbert is torn between his responsibilities for Arnie and his desire to be a free guy and be in a relationship with Becky. Becky passes through town and her and Gilbert are drawn to each other. Johnny Depp is really good at playing the part of Gilbert and Leonardo does amazing acting as a mentally disabled boy. Even down to the mannerisms and speech. To me the part at the end when they burn the house with 'Momma' inside is a way of giving them all freedom. I think their Mom and the house tied them down for so long. Very emotional film but memorable.,What's Eating Gilbert Grape

123,OldRose,Johnny Depp remains the most underrated actor of his generation !,9,8 January 1999,"Apart from perhaps ''Total Eclipse'', this had to be Oscar-nominee (Best Supporting Actor) Leonardo Di Caprio's breakthrough role, but Johnny Depp remains the most underrated actor of his generation in Hollywood.  The insistence on taking roles of substance, depth and feeling (vs. what instantly sells) must be the reason, and the role of Gilbert Grape was no exception.  Depp is brilliant as the overburdened youth, seemingly the lone responsible for a completely dysfunctional family.  Di Caprio's performance as mentally-handicapped little brother Arnie was astonishing, however, and well worth the nod from Oscar.  Like many of Depp's films, this one had a tendency to sneak by the public unnoticed.  Perhaps it's more of a marketing question, but this guy deserves recognition !  If you don't believe me, get the video and find out for yourself (rating = 4.5 stars of 5) !",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
124,Seb_3,Amazing casting all around.,8,25 February 2021,"The story is simple yet manages to be interesting as we follow Gilbert, played by Johnny Depp, living in a small town. Where he has been living his entire life taking care of his family, and his little brother, Arnie. An 18 year old mentally challenged guy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.This isn't some movie about a grander scheme or world domination, or some revenge story. It's about about a small village where everybody know each other and where every rumor, lie and story will be told to from ear to ear - person to person. Its where small changes cause big effects on the community, like a new mall or new people in town.
This is, at its core, a movie about growing up, letting go and how family is a push-pull factor in life. They can hold you back and push you forward, in both the right and wrong directions, which I think speaks to everyone as we all have experienced how our parents and siblings influence on us.The cast in this movie is amazing. Every single character is portrayed to the point by the actors playing them. Johnny Depp does a great job, John Reilly as-well, but especially DiCaprio is amazing in this role and plays his character to perfection. Even the lesser know actors and actresses of the cast, such as the Grape family, does an astounding job, which really sells the small town drama.
An all excellent movie, with great performances and a good story.8/10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
125,johnpmoseley,A beautifully rendered lie,8,10 September 2021,"This film is like a very nice drug you should try to come down off as quickly as possible after watching, especially if you're an impressionable teenage boy. No sagacious white knight old souls in pretty girl form are coming to save you, whether from your dysfunctional family or, even less plausibly, from your own deeply embedded self-torment and inability to love. And your petulant, manipulative mother is unlikely to ever soften, gain self-awareness and apologise of her own accord, much less conveniently die afterwards, freeing you to go off with the old soul girl without the constraint of the guilt that kept you on the leash and subservient.I'm not saying this out of bitterness, I promise, except a little at the way Hollywood has repeatedly told these lies so seductively, and how so many of us would have been better served by movies that didn't make these kinds of absurd salvation seem like deserved inevitabilities and that, instead, taught us a little about the much more exacting, tricky and fulfilling business of actually saving ourselves.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

129,golem3,What's Eating Him? The Story of Gilbert Grape,10,24 September 2005,"Once in a while a movie comes along worth reviewing, and in this case, the classic film What's Eating Gilbert Grape?. This film is an in depth look on how dreary life can be, and how so little can change it all. An amazing cast combined with a fantastic plot or lack of plot has made a beautiful film timeless in all respects. The story takes place in a remote town in the boonies of the United States. Stuck there is an adolescent man Gilbert who has to face his own life; one which is caught in a tangle to complicated relationships that he resents sorting out. Grape (Depp) is an excellent character who displays common human emotion, as well as his excessive kindness toward his disabled brother Arnie (DeCaprio). In fact, surprisingly, DeCaprio executes the role with such fluidity and achievement that one almost forgets all of his other terrible films (and I mean every single other one). Gilbert must face changing times, urbanization of rural America, and a nomadic girl who he develops sincere love for. The ideas that went into making this movie came together so well that I was taken aback  the many banalities of Midwestern living were re-created with accuracy and grace. The changes that the characters went through were perfectly done. The filming was fantastic. The only question that remains  what was eating Mr. Grape? Only the movie can tell. ""Canola Oil. Now that's cutting edge. Your fries are crispier and tastier. That's the future."" ""It's going to take a crane to get her out"" RATING: 10/10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Johnny Depp performs brilliantly as the young, embarrassed, pressured but patient boy who just wants the best for him self and his family.Juliette Lewis is excellent as the confident traveler who Johnny Depp has his eye on. If anyone else were to be cast in this role, it would be a mistake. She's the only one who can make this part work. Leonardo Dicaprio delivers the best acting performance that I have ever seen!

Leo Dicaprio established himself as an actor of extreme talent in my book, however, totally searching himself and then dissolving himself into Arnie Grape-it was fascinating to watch. Johnny Depp, however, turned down his charisma so much that he almost faded in the background-I dig most of his stuff (especially Fear and Loathing)but I think his work in this is sub-par and amatuerish. He acted like one of those cookie cutter ""sensitive loner"" types on those cheesy teen shows. Darlene Cates gave a solid and honest performance. Juliette Lewis did what Juliette Lewis does-freespirited, cryptic but lovable girl with a vulnerable side. It was not a great movie but it is worth seeing.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

I think Darlene Cates portrayal of Ms. Grape (Moma) was phenomenal.  I don't know much about Ms. Cates but I understand this was her first movie role. From personal experience I know what terrible prejudice she must've faced just by being who she was/is.  The story moves at an almost imperceptible pace at times - but it's so good that you don't mind.  The directing and cinematography are both wonderful in this film.

If you want to watch a film that is so true to life in so many respect then What's eating Gilbert Grape is the film for you because once those end titles role up the screen you'll be left feeling so grateful for what you have and so sorry for the people that have to deal with the things shown in this film.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
137,Idolprincess,Very well-done,8,13 July 2004,"I thought I wouldn't like this. I decided to see it because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp who appeared in some of my favorite movies [ Edward Scissorhands, Benny and Joon, etc. ] I knew what the plot was: a guy who lives with his 15 year old sister, his 18 year old mentally disabled brother who could die at any time and his morbidly obese mother always has to do everything for his family and something happens that changes his life. It sounded like it was a typical sappy drama. I usually hate dramas like that. Movies in which the only point is to feel bad for the characters. But this one was quite different. The plot in this movie is unclear, which makes it appealing in my opinion. There isn't a lot of events in the movie, really. It all revolves around Arnie's birthday and Gilbert's meeting with the new girl. The movie is very slow paced and doesn't rely on action and shock to catch his viewer's attentions. It's moving, but the dialogues are also very simple. You might expect this movie to be over-dramatic but it's everything but that. The situation and story are extremely sad, but I never felt overwhelmed by this. Keep in mind that I can't usually handle dramas very well.The movie is about partly about Gilbert, but it also describes life in this town very well. Gilbert's family often has a big impact on the other people in this town, so it's natural that they would be the family that the movie is about. What's also really nice is that Gilbert isn't portrayed as a hero in this movie. He has flaws, and he can make mistakes even if he's taking care of everyone. He is not the typical good-hearted young adult or teenager who's taking care of everyone and wants to give everything for his family. He actually has feelings of his own and he is trying to find himself. The whole movie is about his quest to find who he really is, if he isn't Gilbert Grape, the guy who's always running after his brother Arnie.
Another good point about this movie is the way it was filmed. The visuals are great and the way the movie was made makes us feel like we're seeing life in a different way than usual.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
138,porazzim42,An Under-rated Gem,10,1 August 2009,"Wow...this was one of the most powerful and emotionally gripping movies I have ever seen. The story is told through the eyes of the main character, Gilbert, played marvelously by Johnny Depp. This is a story that most of us can relate to. Gilbert feels trapped in the small town of Endora and doesn't know how he can leave. He has been thrown responsibilities and obligations that he wasn't ready to have. After the death of his father, he is the man of the family, forced to care for his very obese mother, 2 sisters, and his mentally handicapped younger brother Arnie. Due to his mothers health, he is basically the parent of Arnie. He is frustrated and he tries to numb himself from feeling anything at all. He tries to make himself a robot and has almost succeeded until the arrival of Becky. Becky inspires Gilbert to open up his heart...he heart he had closed off for quite some time. She shows him how to open his eyes and see...truly see. The performances were amazing...Leonardo DiCaprio is nothing short of spectacular. Darlene Cates gives a truly heart-breaking performance as Mama.

139,pronetomovies,great film,10,3 November 2015,"What's eating Gilbert Grape is my kind of movie, it's really a splendid film that I can't even believe that it only earned $10,000,000 when it was released at least based on the article I've read. Johnny Depp loves portraying Gilbert Grape not because it was Winona Ryder who showed him the novel but because he could relate to Gilbert himself and I think it is one of the reasons why the role is perfect for him; Darlene Cates who portrayed Bonnie Grape could also relate to her role because she never left her home for 5 years because of the same reason and the part where she told Gilbert that she didn't choose to be on her situation she told her own son the exact same thing at the end of her bed too and after knowing that I just can't help but be emotional on that part. Leonardo DiCaprio did such incredible job portraying Arnie Grape; before they started filming Leo spent time hanging out with kids who are mentally ill and he studied their mannerism -the flickering fingers, facial expressions and wiping the nose.

144,travisyoung,"""I want to be a good person.""",8,23 August 2008,"""Tell me what you want as fast as it comes to you,"" says Becky to Gilbert as they relax in the thick brown grass beside the pond. Stretched out under the bright sun, he closes his eyes and begins to think deeply. ""House...I want a new house for the family."" His dreamlike expression softens. ""I want Mama to take aerobics classes. I want Ellen to grow up. I want a new brain for Arnie."" ""What do you want for you,"" she asks, ""just for you?"" The shadow of a smile drifts across his face, and he replies without hesitation, ""I want to be a good person."" Gilbert Grape is a good person, he just doesn't realize it yet. Johnny Depp portrays the twentysomething Gilbert in Endora, Iowa (Pop. 1,091) as a young man asleep at the wheel of his life. As he narrates his story, we learn his older sister Amy is a mother type figure and a decent cook, only she has a tendency to accidentally start fires (like the one that burned down the elementary school she used to work at). Ellen, his younger sister, is a preening pubescent teen who has an opinion on everything - and it isn't a very good opinion either. Kids from around town come peeking through windows of the ramshackle Grape house to catch a glimpse of his 500-pound mother, who cannot come to the dinner table (or hardly go anywhere for that matter) so the dinner table comes to her. And then there's Arnie. Arnie Grape (in an Oscar-nominated performance by Leonardo DiCaprio) is about to turn eighteen in a few days, and suffers from severe mental retardation. His favorite pastime is to climb up the water tower in the middle of town, but climbing down is a different story. He is unable to dress or bathe himself. He likes to find inventive ways to decapitate grasshoppers, but cries when he realizes he has killed them. As the doctors have warned - and Arnie often cheerfully reminds everyone - he can go at any time. Gilbert puts it this way: ""Some days you want him to live...some days you don't.""Just passing through this off-beat atmosphere is a curiously wise yet enigmatic young stranger named Becky (Juliette Lewis). Everyone else in the sleepy town sees Gilbert as a carbon copy of his father, who committed suicide fifteen years earlier. They see someone going nowhere, and in a sense he already is nowhere. But Becky sees more. She sees more than Gilbert can see in himself, and she sees that his circumstances have made him afraid to feel anything.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is the fine product of director Lasse Hallstrom. Just as in one of his later efforts, Chocolat, Hallstrom has created here a small world where stagnant lives hide under a blanket of tranquility, and a mysterious young woman blows in and changes everything. Beyond the perfect cast of supporting characters played brilliantly by Mary Steenburgen, John C. Reilly, and Crispin Glover, on the surface this could seem like a sentimental teen chickflick dramedy, but it is nothing of the sort. Because in this film Gilbert finds more than just love...for the first time ever, he finds himself, he discovers life, he even discovers death.

On the surface it is a simple story of an unusual family closely bound together, but in actuality it is really about life itself. The title of the film ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" (for international readers, the term 'eating' is a play on words meaning 'bothering') can refer to many facets of his character.[POTENTIAL SPOILERS]Gilbert is bothered by the problems that his mother's large size impose on the family, and yet he isn't bothered enough to realize the curiosity others have in her; even helping kids get a better look at her through the window.
Gilbert is bothered by having to take care of his rather impaired brother Arnie (masterfully played by DiCaprio), and yet he will not tolerate others to be disrespectful to him.Gilbert is bothered by the fact that he is effectively trapped by his family, and yet he really has nowhere to go (which seems to be a favorite chant of Arnie.)Gilbert is bothered by his father's suicide, which apparently triggered his mother's depression that led to her weight problem, and yet he seems constantly filled with the desire to just 'check out' himself but doesn't.
Gilbert is bothered by a non-emotional sexual fling which ultimately has predictable results, and has difficulty dealing with a true relationship with Juliette Lewis.The care and concern that he feels for his family is powerful and tangible. An interesting metaphor used several times is him starting a fire (lighting a match), only to blow it out again, which kind of summarizes his existence; starting something, and then changing his mind (at least until the end of the film.)This film deals with the kind of gut-level emotions that we all have but would rather not acknowledge, very much like 'The Cider House Rules' (by the same director.) A truly wonderful film that should not be missed.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

I thought it would be hard to watch the flick as I would constantly be aware of the big name tags on the back of the actors, but the method acting is done so well that they connect with the viewer instantly.I wasn't that impressed with the film itself - despite the praise I have heard of it in the past. It seemed to superficially glide over all the interesting sub-plots it had created (e.g. the mass production of commercialism hitting the small time, and the fragility of life), never seeming to really dig into the points it was making. Instead it relies on the superb acting skills, before making some daft poignant point such as ""Life always presents opportunities"".Well worth a watch, and is a true credit to the leading cast, but not the classic its branded as.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Since two of my all time favourite actors are in it (the amazing Johnny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio who I didn't even know was nominated for an Oscar in this) I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. Maybe I set my expectations too high and set myself up for disappointment. Depp is really good, not as awesome as usual but he's younger and did a very good job. Di Caprio does very well and I would say awesome for his age as a mentally challenged boy. The movie is basically about Depp dealing with his family (brother Di Caprio and an extremely overweight mother who is so big Depp literally has to put support beams up in the basement and can not fit through her house's doors. I don't want to wreck the ending, it's very good, the mother is a good actress. It's one of those things where the parts are better than the movie they add up to be if that makes sense.

The main character whose name is Gilbert never left his hometown Endora since he was born. He has taken care of his brother, Arnie, who had a mental disability and his fat bulimic mother who has never gone out of home since her husband killed himself and two sisters. One day, he meets Becky who turns out to stay in Endora for a while because of a trailer breakdown.At first, the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio is really great. He played Arnie at the tender age of 15. However, he plays a boy with mental retardation naturally as if he were real retarded boy by devising his look and how to move his body. The acting of Johnny Depp is also excellent. Gilbert is bound his family, so he cannot leave Endora freely. Johnny Depp can express the kindness that Gilbert takes care of his brother and mother and the frustration that he wants to know the world out there. I think it's good scene that Gilbert changes his view of life by commune with Becky.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Sure he takes care of his dysfunctional family but this movie leaves you with a sense of more than that. The scenes just flow and you take up the details almost unconsciously. The characters drive the story, not any plot.As usual, Johnny Depp is remarkable in the title role. Leonardo Di Caprio got an Oscar Nomination for his portrayal or Arnie. The relationship between these two is the focus of the movie, if anything. Juliette Lewis is the 'love interest' and her character is unique to this movie. She plays the other concern in Gilbert's lifeThe movie works well and is never over-dramatic and never tries too hard to make some moral point.

I am almost sure that no one would like to live the life of Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), which is so terrible and unbearable. Leonardo DiCaprioplease see this movie, please do! He shines in this one as he does in every single one he has done by now. He gives one of the BEST performances of the 1990s as a retarded brother of Gilbert, Arnie. He is utterly convincing and off-the-wall. I loved his pure and captivating skillfulness.

Still the way movie goes over and ends is really close to heart and touching The best thing in the movie is all it characters which nearly seem to be perfect. No one other than Johnny Depp could have been better to play Gilbert Grape and I am amazed at the acting skills of Leonardo Di caprio at such a age who has played Arnie Grape, kind of retard fellow. I m really curious what it could have been taken for him to be in such kind of a character and he did it almost perfect as if he was one.

Leonado in particular is outstanding and Depp plays his role well too.The subject matter presents such great possibilities and - thankfully - it certainly avoids all the potential Hollywood clichés that it would have been so easy to fall into. Unfortunately it avoids them so much that it just doesn't go anywhere much at all.The film felt like 4 hours not 2 - which I guess helps us empathise with the lead character! And if the directors aim was to get us to feel empathy with Gilbert Grape then he's done an outstanding job. I now know what it's like to feel trapped, bored, numb, like I'm just passing time.

Outstandingly good are shown family relationships, respect, family, love and other values. In short - things which sometimes we need, but we don't have, because we forget to use it. Gilbert is an example of person who thinks more about other people than about himself. It is so gratifying to watch how Gilbert Grape takes up his father's place. The character is developed very well. Soundtracks are inserted in time and in place. Arnie's character made me nervous, but on the other hand Leonardo DiCaprio developed him perfectly. I recommend this movie for those who love dramas. You will like it one hundred percent. You will fall in love with this movie, because there are so much such as: love, funny moments, disappointments, anguish, fortune, pain, poverty and anger. Plot is very gripping. Cast tried that viewer would feel every emotion which feels the character. It seems that during those 116 minutes nothing happens, but it isn't true. 9/10.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

However, even the great Johnny Depp was out shined in this film by the unbelievable role of Arnie Grape played by Leonardo DiCaprio, if I didn't know any better I'd say that he really did suffer from a serious mental illness. This is by far one of my all time favourite films thanks to DiCaprio, I have a new real respect for him as an actor that I had never noticed before, but now the more I see of him, the greater I think he is, and not just because he's gorgeous and I'm a teenage girl, but because he is one hell of an actor!

As indicated in the other comments, the story depicts a young man, Gilbert Grape, who believes he is destined to stay in a small ""nothing"" town and help provide for his family, which includes an obese mother who has been unable to care for her family for years.  Although this would make someone seem like a saint, he has his downfalls as well --- such as some of the jokes he cracks about his mother and the lack of attention he sometimes pays to his brother --- which is what makes his character realistic.  As the movie progresses with him getting to know Becky, and situations that cause his mother to reflect on her insecurities about herself, I see a lot more depth in each of the characters.  And even though Becky's personality was somewhat annoying to me, she had her good points throughout the story as well.Excellent performances from all of the cast; one of my favorite movies of all time!",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing short of magic in his role, bringing the movie to a level that could never be achieved without him. The storyline was heartwarming, the characters were realistic and the parts were well cast.I had a bit of a problem with some things though; like John C Reilly's character. While he is a good actor and was nice to the Grape family in the movie, he didn't really have a developed personality. He didn't have a background or character development or even a reason of why he was so nice and helpful to the Grape family.Another thing I didn't like was the ambiguity of the ending. Amy finds a job in a new town after the house burns down and Ellen moves away with her which is a happy ending for both of them but Gilbert and Arnie just go where they want to go....? You see him reconnecting with his girlfriend when she comes back to visit, but the bag he's carrying kind of implies that he doesn't have a house. I thought the ending could have been though out better, because there is no way he could take care of his brother with a life of hitch hiking and his grocery job.But don't let my review ruin the movie for you. As I said, that was implied but you don't really know how they are living.

I was just flipping channels and soon I couldn't stop watching it.  This to me, is what a good movie requires and what so many Hollywood movies today neglect, great character developement.  The characters experiences draw you in, you feel what they feel and relate to the real-life situations they face.  I guess its not for everyone, action addicts, need not tune in.  Or maybe you should watch but watch it alone or with one other so you can let it sink in and appreciate and reflect, not snicker. Everyone has s*** they HAVE to deal with in life and sometimes seeing others plights portrayed so realistically can help us deal with our own.Johnny Depp is superb.

From ""Bennie and Joon"" to ""Whats eating Gilbert Grape"", Johnny Depp throws himself into the charactor like no other actor.  He becomes the actor.  One defination of the word ""exquisite"" means ""carefully selected or thought out"", and that is what Depp does when choosing a movie.Leanardo DiCaprio also gives a very strong performance in this film.  He plays a mentally challanged 17 year old who is always getting into trouble. Watching him it was hard to believe that he WASN'T mentally challanged.Lewis had a smaller part, but still crucial to the film.  She potrayed a ""free-spirit"" traveling around the US with her grandmother, with no place special to go and no special time to be there. (hence a freespirit) Unlike ""Natural born Killers"" (in which Lewis played a murdering psyco) in this film she played a very heart warming role, and she did it very well.All in all it was still Johnny Depp's movie.....he WAS Gilbert Grape, and he did it so well.

Johnny Depp as Gilbert is at his finest, sensitive and lovingly protective of his mentally challenged younger brother, Arnie, less understanding of the plight of his grossly overweight mother played brilliantly by Darlene Cates. Gilbert just wants a normal life, a life he seems resigned to being deprived of. He seeks solace in the attentions of a wandering housewife played by Mary Steenburgen. Enter Juliette Lewis as Becky, who captures his heart, personifying all the passion for life and freedom of spirit Gilbert aspires to.

Then there's the fact of having Depp and di Caprio, the best actors of their generation in Hollywood. He's done some  excellent work since this (Titanic, Celebrity and Gangs of New York) but to my mind, this should have been his Oscar (an Oscar which the Academy has so far denied him for anything), and I don't know that he's done anything better. Tough role, teen with a brain birth defect. Depp as the overwhelmed oldest child needing romance and relief is also superb. Steenbergen and Juliette Lewis were both good. With this, I expected better work from Lewis than she has panned out: a shame. The surprise here, however, is a wonderful performance by the center of the story: the 500 (yes, 500 pound, according to her imdb bio), mother of Johnny, di Caprio, the two daughters  all troubled. The realistic depiction of the pain and the courage are extraordinary. It's a heart-warming tearjerker but that doesn't convey 'Gilbert Grapes' depth.

The acting is superb on all accounts from, Depp, Leo, Lewis, to everyone in the family, and the man who is in just about every great movie as of late, John C. Reilly. The plot is this...Leo plays Arnie Grape, a mentally handicapped teenager, who is more like a 5 year old. Depp plays the title character Gilbert Grape, who is the man of the Grape house, and Arnie's idle. Lewis plays Gilbert's love intrest and is traveling through town when she and Gilbert fall in love. The plot of this movie is rather uncertain, it's more like, the life of the Grape family, from the good times to the bad. This movie has so many plots to it, from the struggels of the overweight mother, to the struggels with a mentally retarted son who the family is almost burdened with, to Gilbert falling in love with Becky.

I didn't know much about it, all i knew was that Leonardo Dicaprio was in it. and that he played a Mentally Challenged boy. I begin to watch it. Even the starting is amazing. It just shows the Grape family living there day. Gilbert is the Leader of the family. his father built the house but ever since his father had died. He was in charge of the repairs. He had an overweight mom, an annoying sister and another sister who was like the mom of the family.Throughout the WHOLE movie. I couldn't believe Leonardo Dicaprios performance! It was perfection! Sometimes he made you laugh, sometimes he made you cry. And even sometimes i actually thought he was mentally challenged. Ya, the other performances we're o.k. Like John. C. Reilly's and Julitte Lewis's but Leo's performance was AMAZING! In my opinion it is one of my favorite performances and one of the best performances in decades! This is Leonardo Dicaprio at his best! This Movie had a great story line. Great adaption from the book. It is a classic and it is one of my favorites! If you want to see Leo's bets performance when he was just starting out you have to see this movie NO DOUBT. Leo deserved that Oscar Nomination 100%. I even think he should have won! In Conclusion.

It was several hours of pure MISERY!Thankfully I've blocked out most of my memories of the film, but I would not advise this movie for use as anything but an instrument of TORTURE, and even then it's still so /wrong./ Please, may such an atrocity never be inflicted on the human race again.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
183,todieforx,"Cry,then move on",8,27 June 2008,"Absolutely the best film concerning family issues and goes beyond it.I heard of it long time ago but watched it only last week.Thank god I didn't miss this great work.I won't elaborate on the plot as it's not complex.However,the psychological struggle of the main characters(especially Gilbert)is.Having been stuck in a boring and small town,the life is hopeless for most residents and it is particularly difficult for the Grapes.Obese mom,willful Ellen and retarded Arnie...it is a highly dysfunctional family that,to make it worse,largely depend on the only 'man' at home-Gilbert.Having to shoulder all the responsibilities,Gilbert must,for most of the time,take care of others and when love comes,the only thing he's supposed to do is to repress himself and leave.While life treats him so cruelly,he has somehow learned the truth of life and become more mature,caring and stronger.He knows that he can feel frustrated and angry sometimes,but after the fury and tears,he has to get back up again and move on.That's what happens in the end when mom dies unexpectedly,Gilbert decides to defend his mom's dignity by burning down the house.Now they MUST move on as there's no longer a place to settle down.Isn't it better? The ending of the film heralds a brighter prospect that neutralizes the previous depression.One thing that makes this film outstanding is its sincerity and simplicity.The troublesome family issues,the lost and re-found love,the joys and sorrows in our lives,the ambivalence towards some very close persons...all these are so true and are things we all could identify with.In films like this,no special effects are necessary,hyperbolic acting will be a disaster.Fortunately we have awesome Depp and particularly Leo...the former keeps his excellence by playing a mentally-afflicted role while the latter impresses us with a marvelous acting that enriches this bittersweet story.High respect to all the actors that grasp the inner world of the characters so well.Equally high respect to the scores in this film-they simply add to the emotional power.All in all, this is a film that mainly concerns family issues but is by no means limited to it.It's a hymn to life,to being strong and selfless.Gilbert is a hero in an ordinary life,anyone likes him is.Cry,then move on,cos life goes on and we're forever on the road.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
184,phillewis91,"An odd, enjoyable, and slightly mesmeric experience",7,15 November 2013,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape will inevitably be remembered mainly for it's cast, who now form a sizeable part of the Hollywood elite. Inevitable, but perhaps a shame, as it's an intriguing film in its own right.There's no denying it however, the cast is incredible. It's not just a disgustingly young Leo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp, it's also Juliette Lewis, John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover of Back to the Future fame.It tells the story of Gilbert Grape (Depp on fine monosyllabic form), his disabled brother Arnie (DiCaprio, who steals the show) and 'worldly' girl Becky (Lewis), Gilbert's love interest who travels around the country with her grandmother. It's a meandering film, full of odd little touches - the mother who is so fat that the floor of her house can barely hold her weight; Arnie, who likes to climb as high as he can at every opportunity, and the little faux-philosophical gems that Gilbert grants us.If you're looking for a rip-roaring narrative and non-stop action, this is not the film for you. As Gilbert tells us early on, nothing really happens in the small town he lives in. What little plot there is circles around Gilbert's dilemma - his duty to care for his brother Arnie and to help his gargantuan, housebound mother; and the promised excitement and escape of a romance with the exotic Becky.It's also about acceptance - both Arnie and his mother are outcasts, yet it's the mother and her titanic size that provokes the most open ridicule. People openly take pictures, stare and laugh at her in a way they would never do with Arnie, who is accepted and liked for all his eccentricities.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an odd experience, but an enjoyable, and slightly mesmeric one. It evokes a rather beautiful sense of small town simplicity that makes me despair of the urbane cynicism of modern London.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
185,srinivasane-arav,One of the best about dysfunctional families!,10,11 July 2010,"There are only certain movies that make you feel like they were made just for you. For me What's eating Gilbert Grape is one of them. It's like someone is telling me to live my life. No way my life is in crossroads as it is for Gilbert but have just been afraid to live life to the full. Coming back to the film, there aren't many other films with characters so honest and emotions so sincere. I mean, the entire movie itself is about a bunch of characters trying to figure out what they wanna do. Rather than a movie with a distinct plot, it's more of a character study. I've loved movies about dysfunctional families, but this isn't just another one of them. This is probably the best of them along with The Royal Tenenbaums.And this film will probably be in my top 20 list, if not, definitely in top 30.

The acting was on a level above most films I have ever seen, in particular that of Johny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio. These two actors have shot up in my estimation since my having seen this movie, not in the sense that I didn't appreciate their recent work. I realized what true artists with integrity to their craft they must surely be, having been able to press on with their careers notwithstanding the absence of academy recognition for their performances here. The scene of Arnie trying to wake his dead mother, the developing expressions on his face , his striking of himself on the head, the pitch of his shrieks of joy while up in the tree, it really was character interpretation at its best.

It is just the simple life, told without Hollywoodglamour and unneeded glory.The movie is somehow a dream of an endless reality, a quiet scream, all this paradox things make it more than just a film for the cinema but a film to watch at home and relax just to feel.

189,wowlover-80667,This movie is Gilbert GREAT!,10,5 April 2015,"The acting in this film, especially 18 year old Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as mentally challenged Arnie Grape, is absolutely extraordinary. A few mistakes here and there, but otherwise it is one of my favorite films. I've watched it three times and it never gets old. Never will. I must praise Mr DiCaprio more than the other actors/actresses in this movie because he really worked hard to nail this role. Even before the training, studying, etc... he had the crew wrapped around his dirty little fingers. The role belonged to him. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it. If they did, I would have never seen the movie. Why the Oscar didn't go to him, I don't know. The Academy treats him like just another Disney star, which he isn't. If it weren't for him, The Aviator, Revolutionary Road and other films wouldn't exist. I can't believe he hasn't won an Oscar yet. That's bull crap.Darlene Cates- wow. She really knows how to act, just like Leo. Crying, nailed it. Depression, nailed it. Demanding her son back from the police station, nailed it. Being beautiful, nailed it. How she managed to keep her eyes closed and stay still while Arnie shook her and yelled in her ear, that's incredible.

190,Lily-29,"A heart warming, sweet film",10,4 July 1999,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape? the title of this film is begging for an answer and the film delivers. 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' is the heart warming tale of the Grape family. In particular Gilbert (Johnny Deep) who so eloquently put by Arnie (Leonardo Dicaprio)is not going anywhere. Gilbert is stuck in a town, in a life of numbing sameness. His routine of caring for his handicapped brother Arnie, working at the grocery store to support his family, and having to cope with the embarrassment of his extremely over weight mother has  taken it's tole on him and he soon finds himself headed down the same fateful path as his father. That is until Becky (Juliette Lewis) enters the scene and proves to be a catalyst for change in Gilbert's life.The film is extremely well acted although Dicaprio steals the film with his portrayal of the handicapped Arnie, Johnny Depp should not be over looked in what is one of his best performance of his career.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Reilly, Mary Steenburgen and Juliette Lewis in supporting roles. A great little movie in many ways, the supporting cast-including Crispin Glover, not listed on the DVD box, carry this movie. Leo DiCaprio's performance in this movie is stunning. Oscar worthy, he was nominated that year but he really should have won the award. Depp and Lewis provide adequate performances, decent work but not particularly noteworthy. Will not talk about the plot itself, definitely better for the viewer to watch it unwind.

194,amicsenyi,The movie belongs to Depp,10,30 January 2006,"There is no other way to say it, I love this movie. Johnny Depp gives what I consider his best performance ever. A performance that is overshadowed by DiCpario's Arnie, but one that I think establishes him as one of the best actors of his generation. Depp's Portrayal of the main character Gilbert, a sensitive, emotionally torn character that struggles with his duty to his family, and his own wants and desires in life, is so natural it's hard to see where the character begins and where Depp, himself, ends. I rented this movie back in '93 and am happy to say that I've been a devoted fan every since.The movie is an example of perfection. Great direction by Hallstrom along with a great script and great acting help to make this movie one of the most underrated movies of the '90's. The characters are real, conveying emotions that could be had by anyone who has ever felt that they needed more out of life, but needed that extra push to get them moving. And the setting could be any small town in America, which makes it even more relevant.The acting is great. Whenever I doubt DiCaprio's acting ability I always come back to his performance as Arnie and it makes me realize just how talented he is, even though sometimes it gets blurred by his good looks. John C. Reily, Juliette Lewis, Crispin Glover, and Mary Steenburgen all give excellent performances but the movie belongs to Depp. This movie is a must see.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
195,pottergurl4457,"Gilbert Grape is the primary provider for his fatherless family, especially his intellectually disabled brother.",8,24 August 2016,"This movie is spectacular. The cutting edge of the dialogue is sharp and hits all the feels. The bareboned plot is part of the reason why this movie is so powerful. I may be one of those lame-os that's not got around to watching this until Leo won the Oscar, but I'm glad I came. Lots of people (probably people that haven't seen this movie) say that he should have won one for Titanic, but honestly he's infinitely more brilliant as Arnie Grape than as Jack Dawson. Titanic is like a game of pretend compared to this movie (no hate, I still love it). Also important to note, there's practically no other movie out there where intellectual disabilities are explored and treated with as much respect as it was treated in this movie. As much as you see the Grapes struggle with Arnie (occasionally physically) the way the writers, producers, and directors chose to portray Arnie as a character was fantastic. Cut scenes of him laughing and playing at the end of a tense scene. Treating him less as a sidekick and more as a secondary protagonist. It's so rare to see people with intellectual disabilities given the respect any other human being would get in the real world, let alone in pop culture.

199,Eidet,A Decent Film Anchored to DiCaprio's Breakout Performance as Mentally Impaired Arnie Grape,7,13 September 2015,"""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" directed by Swede Lasse Hallström (director of ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"") focuses on Gilbert Grape, a young adult taking care of his brother with a developmental disability and his morbidly obese mother, in the days leading up to his brother's 18th Birthday. His brother Arnie Grape, splendidly played by a young Leonardo DiCaprio, has against all odds lived past the ten years medically allotted his life due to his condition. Arnie's upcoming birthday works as a backdrop for the movie.The film's plot seemed a little too thin to me with the majority of the film being episodic occurrences in the Grape family's everyday lives. Although this lets us closer in on the characters, I got the feeling that the film lacked the direction it needed in order to advance the plot. The dialog felt awry on occasion discernible for instance in exchanges between Gilbert and his friends Tucker Van Dyke (John C. Reilly) and town coroner Bobby McBurney (Crispin Glover). In fact, I thought John C. Reilly gave a poor performance throughout.Director Lasse Hallström has a tendency of making feel-good films without a lot of depth to them. I do not necessarily dislike films of this format, but they do have to redeem themselves in other departments to make up for this. The strongest selling point of the movie is therefore by far the performances by the actors. Casting director Gail Levin did well in bringing on Johnny Depp and Darlene Cates (the mother) as Gilbert and Bonnie Grape respectively, both whom delivers earnest and appealing performances. It goes without saying however that Leonardo DiCaprio is the one to watch out for in this picture. His acting is so convincing as to make it very difficult to believe he is acting a part in the first place. From the mannerisms he evokes to the way he talks and does his posturing, all bear witness to an immensely talented actor. DiCaprio, who was 18 at the time of filming, spent several days at a home for mentally challenged teens where he would talk to the kids as well as observe their mannerisms. This must have been a deciding factor in how he was able to act the part with such strong conviction.The efforts of Editor Andrew Mondsheim left me scratching my head for a bit. Some scenes ended with almost no dialog at all, and I would have wanted him to show more patience during stretches of the film. Mondsheim was Oscar-nominated in 2000 for editing M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", so he seems skilled enough to have done a better job with the film. The music in the film was too repetitive and dull for my taste. In addition, I thought the film was overlong. The fictional town of Endora with its gloomy atmosphere sets up the film nicely though, and the cinematography was befitting the themes of the film.I would call this a good film, a simple one, but a good one still. It is worth the while if only to watch Leonardo DiCaprio's solid performance as autistic Arnie Grape. That the Academy could favour Tommy Lee Jones's role in ""The Fugitive"" over DiCaprio is absurd to me, but DiCaprio is no stranger to such disappointments as time has shown.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

It uses nothing but the reality its story and great acting from its cast - particularly from Depp, DiCaprio, and Cates - to carry itself through, and in the end, it succeeds beautifully in giving us a glimpse into human nature and strength.

206,nat_rocks1989,A fabulous film,10,19 July 2006,"I first watched 'What's eating gilbert grape' at the age of eleven or so, just after I'd developed an interest in Leonardo DiCaprio's work.The film follows Gilbert Grape, a young man who lives with his disabled brother and clinically obese mother in a small town where 'nothing ever happens'. Gilbert is having an affair with an older married woman and feels trapped in the town he lives in - his father is gone and he is the main provider for his family.The film portrays public scrutiny well, as people don't accept Gilbert's mother - as well as conveying a sense of doubt and isolation, Gilbert's true frustration with a world that provides him with little solace.Watching it now, with a more mature and adult perspective, I see what was always present in this film, how truly remarkable each element really is. The acting is absolutely spot on, Johnny Depp is a phenomenal actor and portrays Gilbert well, Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of disability is also fabulous - such a hard thing to accomplish.

Fortunately, I went deeper in my Depp's fascination and found out Edward Scissorhands, Private Resort (Ok, maybe not a so good example...), and, of course, What's eating Gilbert Grape. This movie has this family thing, this feeling that whatever you'll do with your life, you'll always be stuck with the same one, as good or as bad as it gets. Your mother, as fat as she will get will always try to look upon your actions and take care of you. Your sisters, as crazy and weird they are will always be there for you, to loan you some money or to welcome you for the night if you got the blues. And your brothers, as unsuitable and non- conform as they are, will always be attached to you in a way, even if you'd better like them not to... This performance by Leonardo Dicaprio is so remarkable that I still have trouble recognizing he was so young when he did it. We truly believe in his character and it's impossible thinking of it as a joke. Juliette Lewis too is so true in her character, taking Gilbert Grape away from his problems for a moment...",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

I have read that he actually interacted with mentally disabled people and analysed their behaviour. He portrayed the character with impeccable talent. The movie itself is pretty slow and best to watch while multitasking.,What's Eating Gilbert Grape
209,TrickyPiranha,Makes you think,10,21 August 2002,"Bittersweet and poignant are two words to describe this film.  The performances by every actor are magnificent especially the understated one of Johnny Depp. Even though many of his previous roles before this film were eccentric, he is the only one in his family who isn't.  Leonardo DiCaprio though i don't like any of his other films i must say is remarkable as the role of Arnie Grape and should have one the Oscar for this role.   Though Peter Hedges wrote the screenplay and the book, the two are very different. The book is more ironic and bitter but still very humourous.  The film has in funny moments that come from the people themselves rather than clever remarks.  In my opinion, one of the most funniest characters is Ken Carver and his interaction with his two sons. Probably some of the funniest dialogue in the whole movie.  One thing that i am glad about this film is that Bonnie Grape (played by the marvelous Darlene Cates) is not made into a joke. That could have happened very easily if the film was given the Hollywood treatment.  It is too bad that there aren't more films out there as endearing as this one.  A good film to watch that makes you think.  I also have to recommend the book. I read the book after viewing the film, and it is much different and you get more subplots with the characters that you don't get to see in the movie.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
210,tvguy29,I'm sorry,5,25 August 2012,"I feel almost guilty writing a review for this film....because it's not a positive one...and I have friends who really like it, and say they ""identify"" with it.But, I gotta be honest...it's boring. It is 128 minutes long. And for 120 of those minutes, I was waiting for something, anything, interesting, unusual, inspirational to happen.I might as well have watched Little House on the Prairie, or The Walton's.CharactersGilbert (played by Johnny Depp) is longing for something more than what he has and what he knows. But he is tied down with helping the local store, looking after his brother Arnie, and taking care of his mother.His sisters are also longing for something more.Arnie (played by Leo DiCap) likes to climb the local water tower and it makes everyone very nervous (which is why he ends up in jail). Later he celebrates his 18th birthday. Something that the doctors said would never happen. Arnie is an adorable special needs kids who can be somewhat of a handful from time to time.Gilbert's mother is a big woman, who used to be beautiful. She finally recognizes that eating lots of fried chicken and cheese curds may possibly lead to obesity. She realizes how big she has become when she goes to rescue Arnie from the local jail where hoards of local folks have gathered to ogle her and take her picture. There are about 30 people waiting outside the jail when she comes out....waiting to see old Widow Grape. Does anyone else think this is pathetic? Your thrill of the day was seeing the fat woman in town? Here's a dollar...go purchase a meaningful life.Gilbert's mom passes away after she successfully walks upstairs for the first time in ages. Although this event is tragic, it ultimately frees the siblings of their commitment to stay at home and care for their mother. They are now free to pursue other beneficial and productive interests. The world is at their fingertips. Will they take that next step? Will they move out of Endora? Will they put forth the effort to improve their sense of self-worth...or will they be content to remain as they are? That is mostly left up to the viewer to decide. Gilbert will almost certainly be the one who will care for Arnie.Plot It's about the lives of a small-town family in any-town USA.Gilbert is banging some other man's wife because she ""settled"" and married some bland insurance agent that she wasn't truly in love with (she later admits after he dies that she ""misses him and she doesn't miss him""). That's another way of saying she married the wrong guy. She used him as a safety net. Now that her safety net is gone, she ""misses him"". But that didn't stop her from cheating on him. And she didn't give a sh*t about him while he was alive.Later in the film, Gilbert hits his special needs brother, Arnie because he's being difficult. (Go figure, a special needs kid not understanding the consequences of his actions). Gilbert feels bad about doing this and runs to the local new girl in town, Becky (played by Juliette Lewis). He finds that she has gotten Arnie to go swimming (something that Arnie is fearful of). Shortly thereafter, he confesses his mistake to Becky and all is well in the morning. The whole movie is like this.The best part is the house burning down...Gilbert did not want her mother to be disrespected by airlifting her out of the upstairs (after she dies) because they cannot carry her down the stairs. Good for you, Gilbert. Summary This movie is chalk full of the inconsequential happenings of an any-town family in any-town America. And it is 128 minutes of boredom. Bottom line - many, many people go to movies to see something they CAN'T see in everyday life. They go to movies to learn, to be inspired, to escape. Where I live, I could drive 20 miles in any direction and experience any of the plot points in this film first-hand, and it wouldn't cost me $5 for a ticket. Synopsis -Common events happening to common people.-Uninspiring and dull-The minute I entered the town of Endora, I wanted to leave. I felt the same at the end of my 128-minute journey.Conclusion -Leo gives the performance of a lifetime as Arnie!For that, I kick it up one point.-The material, subjects, and style of this film are purposefully focused on the ordinary. Thus, this film is ordinary. So, it gets an ordinary score. 5/10.Apologies to my friends who like it. I fail to see the allure. I'd rather have my grandmother take a big stinky dump on my chest.

211,cleolain-1,Gilbert Grape is one of my all-time favourite movies,10,4 March 2009,"I have read all the posts regarding this movie and I am amazed at the range of ratings it has been given. Rather than give a synopsis of this movie, I would prefer to indicate why I love it so much: 1. The story is of a ""functional"" dysfunctional family. Despite the challenges they face they work together and respect and love each other; 2. Gilbert is very human. He is trapped by circumstances beyond his control and is doing the best he can. He does not realize what a good person he is and, although he slips when he strikes Arnie in frustration, he is forgiven and redeemed; 3. Arnie is a full-realized individual and although mentally-challenged, (please note, this character is NOT autistic) he has layers of behaviour and emotion that are as complex as any experienced by the ""normal"" members of society; 4. Mrs. Grape is as handicapped as Arnie but loves her children and they love her. They are forced daily to accommodate her limitations and do it in a respectful and accepting way; 5. Becky is the force of change in Gilbert's life. Will he courageously follow this new path or remain stuck in his life as it is now? In summary, this is a story about love, acceptance and change.

This is one movie that will last in my Top 10 best movie list for a long, long time. Leo at one of his best & Depp at his usual perfection. The story is a about a person named Gilbert Grape (Jhonny Depp) and his life. Centered around his responsibilities of caring for his family and his younger brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is suffering from a developmental disability. Although Jhonny Depp is the lead character in the story, Leonardo DiCaprio steals the show with his brilliant portrayal of the mentally retarded character. The movie has been so well made that there were moments when tears dripped out of my eyes. Slightly slow paced so watch it when you have lots of time and savour every moment of it.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

215,michelle-gilmore3,What's the Big Deal?,6,23 March 2012,"Gilbert Grape is a well-put together, but flawed film. The director obviously puts a lot of care into capturing such a deeply emotional story, and he paces his film fittingly. The film is very consistent, and this works throughout the film's entirety, but the minuscule variations in tone and pace drag the film down. The director does a nice job at showcasing the wide open rural setting the film is takes place in and he uses a lot of good country motifs to give the film its consistent mood. He no doubt shoots the film very well and makes the most out of what he is given.There are a number of big stars in this film, and they all do a good job. Johnny Depp carries the film very well and is plenty believable. The character of Gilbert Grape teeters on the line between angry and sympathetic about his brother Arnie. He even makes the statement at the beginning of the film, ""The doctor says Arnie could die any day. Some days you're glad Arnie's alive. Some days... you're not."" This line sets the stage for a lot of Gilberts polarizing attitudes that he has to fight through to keep his family safe. He is a character a lot of people can surely relate to, making the whole story much more personal for certain audiences. For me, I understood the challenge of Gilbert, but obviously couldn't connect at the same level as some people might.DiCaprio gets a lot of praise for his role as the severely mentally disabled Arnie Grape. I think that a lot of the acclamation he gets for this role is overrated. For the level at which DiCaprio plays his character, he does a good job. However, I wish Tropic Thunder could have come out about fifteen years earlier so that DiCaprio would have been enlightened by the infamous yet relevant phrase, ""you never go full retard."" I hate to say it, but DiCaprio went full retard. Like I said, for going full retard DiCaprio handled the role well, but the fact of the matter is you never go full retard.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

I'd never heard of it before then, but after reading the film's summary I immediately decided to rent it. From the moment that the movie began I was hooked. It's a story of a small-town guy named Gilbert Grape, played by Johnny Depp. Gilbert has spent his entire life caring for his family which includes his dangerously overweight mother and his mentally challenged brother, Arnie. When Johnny falls in love, he soon finds it harder to deal with caring for his family. I found this movie to be wonderful. The acting was excellent, the story was beautiful, and I cried and laughed. I highly recommend this film.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
218,nightlq,One of the best!,10,13 April 2018,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of my favorite movies. It has everything going for it. The acting is phenomenal, all the actors were great the best of which being Leonardo DiCaprio, it is one of the best acting performances I've ever seen and is pretty underrated seeing as he didn't even win the Oscar.
 It is a very realistic movie about a family that is all types of messed up. The mom is obese and the younger brother is special Ed. The little sister is a brat but not to the point were it makes you too angry. The movie takes its time and the only real plot is that it's Arnie's (the special Ed brother played by Leonardo DiCaprio.) 18th birthday coming up and because the doctor said we wouldn't live past 10 it's a big deal. While all this happens we see these characters develop. We see how much of a loving and great brother Gilbert (Johnny Depp) is. We also see that despite how fat and seemingly lazy Bonnie Grape (Darlene Cates) is a mother that would do almost anything for Arnie. By the time she dies at the end is genuinely sad. Gilbert is an extremely reliable character that though has messed up wants his brother to be happy.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

I especially love the end-it is loose and freeing, near-perfection.

Juliette Lewis, who I associate with really strange characters (Kalifornia, Cape Fear) is very sweet and down to earth as the girl traveling through Iowa with her grandma in an Airstream Trailer. And this may be Leo DiCaprio's best movie as Arnie, a mentally disabled child. I don't dare give away the plot, but check for the supporting roles played by Mary Steenbergen and Kevin Tighe (of Emergency fame!).

Although Depp's character is the ""lead"", he's surrounded by a fantastic ensemble cast, including Leo DiCaprio in an Oscar-nominated performance. (Another actor who was great even way-back-when. It's ironic how Depp's career went from indie to blockbuster, and DiCaprio's has gone from blockbuster to less mainstream - both with fantastic results.) The quirky characters, the small-town setting - it all comes together to create an enjoyable film. It's too bad Lasse Hallstrom has veered off this track in his later movies.

They star in one of the worst films I've watched, 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'. Their performances by the actors Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio is good, I give many credits to Leonardo DiCaprio for his acting, he acted like a mentally retarded person, I couldn't tell it was fake!The plot is very different compared to all the action movies we love from Hollywood. The Grapes' are already troubled from the start, and things just get worse. It may have a star studded line up but the actual storyline is out of date for this time. It is set in a fake town called Endora, in Iowa, USA.The acting is exceptionally good, Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job of acting like a mentally retarded person. Johnny Depp is not serious enough to play this role of the main character, he still is renowned for his humor. People who love seeing Johnny Depp in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie series will be disappointed . As Johnny Depp tries to be a very serious person (which he is not), it is advised to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' fans and others not to watch this film.The funny remarks that Johnny Depp makes to the obese actress Darlene Cates who plays ""Momma"" are funny especially the line, ""She is a whale!"" There are many stereotypes shown, that Americans are fat and love eating fat, is in this movie. Another stereotype that is shown is the Americans love for fast food.The director Lasse Hallstorm has bought his Swedish filming styles and have used very awkward camera shots in this film. The cameramen in this film movie were lazy. They used the same shot (Wide shot, for those actually interested) for most of the film.Also featured in this film is the weird Juliette Lewis. She is probably the worst actress in this film. She is unattractive and uninteresting. Her life is so ""perfect"" which is so fake!I give this film 1 star, for the acting that Leonardo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp and Darlene Cates, which saved this film from getting nothing! This is a very badly finished film, with a very laid back and pathetic plot. The screenplay is pathetic, it highly lacks pizazz. This is one of the worst ways to waste 113 Minutes thanks to Swedish director, Lasse Hallstorm. This movie is a mix of a slow plot + good acting + corny lines x laughter ÷ by a little bit of romance = BORING!",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
232,aimers_4,Never Alone,9,16 July 2009,"""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is a movie that shows the struggle of a family, because their father left them and the children have to take care of their obese mother who cannot get around. In the movie Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) is the man of the house. Gilbert works at the local grocery store to support the family. He also has to take care of his younger brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is suffering with autism. Gilbert has no time to himself, but when Becky (Juliette Lewis) comes along things started to change. Every time Gilbert would go somewhere he takes Arnie with him, so eventually Arnie has a special bond with Becky.The director Lasse Hallstrom delivers the message that it takes more than one person to take care of a child who is mentally disabled. Gilbert was always having a hard time taking care of Arnie. Every time Gilbert would turn his head when they were in town, Arnie would climb up the water tower and then they would get in trouble by the police officers. When Becky came into Gilbert's life, he always takes Arnie with him everywhere he goes. One time when Gilbert tried letting Arnie take a bath by himself, so he could meet up with Becky, Arnie stayed in the bath tub all night because he didn't know what to do. So that was the end of leaving Arnie by himself.My favorite part of the movie is the night before Arnie's birthday party. Arnie and Gilbert were arguing because Arnie did not want to take a bath because of the incidence when Gilbert left him in the tub all night. So Arnie ran away and went to Becky's house. Gilbert and his sisters went and looked for Arnie all night; they eventually found him swimming in the lake with Becky. It shows that he has a strong connection with Becky and he trusts in her. Another good part in the movie is when Arnie climbs on the water tower and Gilbert sings to him, and that made Arnie want to come down.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

234,andrew7777,A Thought-Provoking Masterpiece,10,12 April 2012,"Let me just start off by saying that this is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen. Every moment starting from the second the film began, I found myself mesmerized by its articulate beauty. Every character is massively complex and I started to have different feelings about each of them as time went on; with the obese Bonnie living in denial, the brother, Arnie with special needs who at times you can both love and absolutely hate, and even Gilbert who only wants to be a good person and help his dysfunctional family make it through life while at the same time tries desperately to make himself happy, none of the plot points ever become stale or predictable thanks to the numerous dynamics of character. The story seems to flow as casually as a conversation wit a close friend, weaving in and out of Gilbert's redemption as he falls in love and faces life as it truly is. If I were to suggest any film to see to show just how much we take our lives for granted, without a doubt ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" would fall out of my mouth in an instant. It is truly a movie that everyone should watch and appreciate before their time here on Earth runs out.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

His morbidly obese mother, Bonnie has done little except eat since her husband died, and longs only to see Arnie live to the age of 18. With Bonnie unable to care for her children on her own, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and looking after Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the town water tower, while his sisters Amy and Ellen do the rest. The relationship between the brothers is of both care and protection, as Gilbert continually enforces the 'nobody touches Arnie' policy. A new ""Foodland"" supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery where Gilbert works. In addition, Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman, Betty Carver. The family is looking forward to Arnie's 18th birthday. A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when their car breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their possible romance. His affair with Mrs Carver ends when she leaves town in search of a new life following her husbands death,. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie and as she talks to Gilbert she begins to unlock some buried hopes, dreams and happiness. Later on, Arnie tries to run away yet again from his bath and in his frustration Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert takes the car and runs out without another word, fearing that he is leaving his family just like his father and brother did.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is just an incredibly beautiful and touching movie that will always have a special place in my heart. It makes you laugh, cry, and think about how precious life is. All the characters are relatable or likable in some way. Even in the smallest of all towns where it seems like it's just dead, there is life. That's what this movie is about to me, everyone has a story and everyone has an experience to share. This is just a terrific film, quality acting and a heart felt story, I very much recommend that if you get the chance to watch it.

I actually was aware of who he was at the time, as I had been a big fan of the show ""Growing Pains,"" but was no less impressed by that. I think the woman who played the mother was incredibly brave to put herself out like that, I have nothing but respect for her. And I pretty much love everything Johnny Depp has ever done.

I hadn't even realized the main characters were played by Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. (I had remembered ""Gilbert"" as being Lou Diamond Phillips...sorry!) DiCapprio was amazing, and so young! I saw hints of this great performance again in The Aviator (which I also purchased). Perhaps DiCaprio works best when portraying the ""mentally challenged"" among us.While the film suffers from technical issues (the trucks headlights duplicated in the camera lens--c'mon! You can ""PhotoShop"" that out now, can't you?) and a lack of editing, I had time tonight, and actually enjoyed the longer pace.Though fiction, it's a story of real life events, and from the comments written here, I know many people related to it.

When the DVD became available, I bought it. However I did not watch it for several years ... my mother developed Alzheimer's, and the storyline was too close to home. When I did watch it again I realised just how powerful and true the performances really were. Everyone comments on Leonardo's role, and rightly so ... it is astounding, especially for someone so young. But, with the experience of living with a difficult family situation, I now realise just how spot-on Johnny Depp's performance was. He capture's the conflict between love and reality perfectly ... no matter how much you love someone, there are times when you just cannot love them. It would have been so easy for the portrayal of Gilbert to be shallow goodness and sweetness, and then the scene where he hits his brother would have been so wrong. As it is, it rings so true. Also wonderful is the portrayal of conflict between resentment at the eldest brother's ""escape"" and still desperately wanting to care for the disabled brother. The ability to really express the conflict that carer's inevitably have is incredibly difficult.

I've seen this movie after all the other Dicaprio's movies and if it wasn't for this I would not be able to believe that Dicaprio himself wasn't a mentally challenged kid because he brings so much to the table in this movie in such a simple way. I'm glad that he got an Oscar nod over this, because without that nod I probably wouldn't even know that this movie existed. The remaining characters are competent as well.

I fell in lust with Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean and he made me a real fan in Finding Neverland. But in Gilbert Grape, he won my heart completely. This man can act with his eyes. The biggest surprise was Leo DiCaprio as Arnie. Amazing, and he was only 19 when the film was released. He gave an amazing portrayal of a boy who goes in and out of his own world. Juliette Lewis was a quiet storm in this film; she gave Gilbert an anchor of solid acceptance when the pain of his life almost got the best of him. The casting worked perfectly to create family dynamics that were so very real that they did not even seem brandable as dysfunctional. I appreciated that the mother was never portrayed as less intelligent simply because she was overweight.

I also agree with another viewer that it would have been cool to see into the lives of everyone in the grape household- and not just arnie and gilbert. Movie did a great job at setting the mood and tone- creating the perfect depressing place that just creates pity for the characters. Sometimes dialouge is really awkward as well. Actors and actresses did a gr8 job with the given script, especially leo. Its interesting how i really enjoy the ending but also would have loved to see a more bittersweet or sadder ending.

Don't waste your time. this has to be one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen in my life I will never get my two to three hours back from watching this piece of garbage which was under acted and under scripted it is horrible. just because the movie is about a kid with autism and a morbidly obese mother does not mean that it should get four stars there was no plot at all.,What's Eating Gilbert Grape

DiCaprio and Depp at their, unfortunate some what forgotten, best. ""What's eating..."" also always reminds me why I'm supposed to be sorry for reading an interview with Juliette Lewis. In which she was saying that she'll only be doing parts in the future if she's in the need for money. This movie however is one of the top rated on my list on Swedish films an film makers doing something sensible. So beside the exquisite arts of the actors, director Lasse Hallstrom is the one to honored. Thank you Lasse! In conclusion: Makes one proud to be a Swede... for once.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
252,brown ale geordie,Indie is the new mainstream,7,13 March 2002,"A movie set in the probably most boring place on earth, Endora, somewhere deep down in Iowa. The Grape family lives there and the strange characters of this family are the reason why ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is not as boring as the small town where something's ""eating Gilbert Grape"". Alongside Gilbert (Johnny Depp), who is about 20 years old, his obese mother (Darlene Cates), who has never left home since her husband's suicide seven years ago, and Arnie (Leonardo di Caprio), his 17 years old retarded brother, are the main family -members in this Indie-movie. Gilbert's life can hardly be described as thrilling except for the intimate meetings with married Mrs. Carver (i.e. delivering her some sperm after delivering what she has bought in the local grocery-store Gilbert works in). So he's really delighted when Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives at Endora with her grandma (Penelope Brenning) and their camping-van and the two young people fall in love with each other. But as the whole film is not the typical Hollywood stuff, their love story also isn't a typical one. They talk about Becky's uncommon definition of Love and also have their arguments, but nevertheless Becky is able to break the routine of the Grape's life. Swedish director Lasse Hallström has of course not created the era-defining movie the world was waiting for. But together with some convincing actors (especially Depp, di Caprio and Cates) he makes a quiet and slow but intense movie out of the novel by Peter Hedges and succeeds in showing real human characters and not just fat or retarded subjects. Therefore ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is despite it's quite bizarre setting a movie to tell something about everyone's life in a sometimes funny, sometimes sad but always touching way.7/10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

Depp, DiCaprio, Juliet Lewis and everyone else were so brilliant. The direction was simple but awesome.

But when the free-willed Becky comes through town, she catches Gilbert's curiosity in both her and the world outside....Though Gilbert is flawed, viewers are drawn into the movie because can they can identify with his love of his family yet the dream of escaping and finding a more exciting life.

He is tired of being in small town, but he feels he can never leave because of his family. One day, a girl named Becky (Juliette Lewis) comes to the town and inspires him. He is attracted to her free personality and begins to think over about his life and hopes.I love this movie, but not only because of the actor and the actress. The story and the performance are amazing. Especially, Leonardo Dicaprio's performance is terrific. When I saw him performing Arnie for the first time, I thought he is really retarded.

This movie takes us into the complicated life of Gilbert Grape and all the ""weights"" he holds on his shoulder.  As Arnie's 18th birthday looms ahead, Gilbert is faced with dealing with not just his brother's and the rest of his family's lives, but his own as well.

This must be Di Caprio's most outstanding portrayal. He is utterly convincing. What Johnny Depp brings to his character is warmth and humility, something which is sadly lacking in American culture of today. This a film that explores loyalties in human relationships, within a family, employer/employee, marriage, and lovers. It moves, you are never distracted, there is tension to keep you watching right to the end. The film is brilliantly photographed and outstandingly directed.

I still think hes a good actor. But this performance was amazing and he portrayed someone that was severely mentally challenged. I am not as severe as his character is in the movie, but i do have a disability and I really hate it when people used the word retard its very hurtful because i still have people call me that once in awhile.

Leonardo DiCaprio played the mentally disabled character Arnie he played it so well i thought that maybe it wasn't him playing it but an actual mentally disabled person was. Johnny Depp's character (Gilbert) is the big brother of the movie and cares for his family before himself and is very unselfish. Bonnie is extremely obese and this shows but it doesn't stop her from loving her family. In our eyes this movie was a 6 out of 10 for different reasons being it is funny at times but is also depressingly mean and the mother (bonnie) is taunted about her weight it is very eye openingly cruel of what todays people have become.,What's Eating Gilbert Grape

The movie is just telling a story but what makes you keep watching this movie is the brilliant Leonardo Dicaprio acting which is one his best acting role ever. I mean he has been so natural in the whole movie and no one else could have played it better than him. The movie shows Leo's acting talent even when he was a young boy.

I have a young son with Learning difficulties and Leonardos character in this film reminded me so much of my son it made me cry. My son actually looks like Leonardo which makes the resemblance so much more, but he has really captured the character amazingly. I hated Titantic and was very disappointed that Leonardo was in it but he was still good in it, but The Departed was a fantastic film and he deserved best actor for it. I really hope Leonardo continues to be offered great parts and that he gets the credit he deserves for being one of the best actors this century. Gilbert Grape is such a lovely film. Its so nice to see a film where the characters are like real people who are genuine and caring. Johnny Depp was as usual, great and i wish i could meet a man as nice as him in my life!

This movie is quite personal to me. I know what it means to stick around for the family, and how trapped you are, as the eldest son.I like the way in which the movie is set, a small lonely country town, far away from the urban fuzz. A mother who has let herself go, and her two elder kids who work hard to make the ends meet, a challenged 3rd, and a 16old last girl. Elder son has to work for the bread, he is actually shown as if he is replacing his deceased father, but when he looks for his future calling(a girl) he is facing a dilemma whether to just quit or to stick around. I just like the acting, DiCaprio is a prodigy, such a great performance at such an young age.

I work with a special needs child; very similar to Arnie though she cannot communicate as well and some people do not accept her; which is such a shame as she is a beautiful girl.Leonardo DiCaprio performance of Arnie was wonderful; it was such a joy to see Arnie's love for the simple things in life and the most dramatic for me was when Arnie found his mother dead. But I cannot go without saying what a wonderful performance was given by Mr Depp.....whose emotions were well acted...from the struggle to keep his brother Arnie out of mischief...to trying not to be ashamed of his mother. I just loved the way he hugged his mother after he came back to be at Arnie's birthday party; to me that was the highlight of the film...he truly was her ""knight in shimmering armour"" and she did appreciate him and loved him for his total love for Arnie; for children like Arnie and the girl I work with really do need total love; for then they can grow and blossom into the wonderful people that they are, and this movie really shows that from a family who have not so much worldly hardships, but mental and physical hardships with love and appreciation they can succeed.

Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance ever, this movie is a true drama. The focus of the movie is of course Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp). However, there are really several focal points in the movie, all of which add to a powerful storyline. As the title of the film suggests, just about everything seems to be a hardship for Gilbert, yet, somehow he manages to come to terms with reality and in the end obtains a newfound respect for life.With good performances by supporting actors and actresses (Juliette Lewis, Darlene Cates, Leo D., and all the other ""Grapes"") and a nice comic relief from the city coroner (Bobby McBurney) and the local handyman (John C. Reilly), this movie should be seen by anyone who wishes to put themselves in a place where country roads and beautiful greenery give way to the perils and pitfalls of smalltown life.Overall great acting, a good story, and something with which we can all relate.

Our protagonist, Mr. Johnny Depp did his usual amazing work, but it is the performance by Leo that makes this film a must see. I just saw it again tonight, and was blown away again.

Focusing on the angst of an unwanted small-town life, the film follows the daily life of Johnny Depp's Gilbert Grape. He is sarcastic yet introverted, protective yet shy. His mentally-challenged brother, Leonardo Dicaprio's Arnie, steals the heart and full attention of the audience. His depiction of a teenager trapped in the inescapable bind of mental retardation is moving and real, deserving of the 1993 Oscar Award Nomination.Darlene Cates, who plays Momma, delivers a truly remarkable performance. Her display of motherly devotion, emotional turmoil and daily physical struggle are deserving of grand recognition.Gilbert's life is turned around by the unexpected introduction of Juliette Lewis's Becky. Becky's free-spirited and optimistic take on life greatly influence's Gilbert's own life. WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is deeply tragic yet deeply real tale of a complicated family stuck in a simple town.

280,LunaSerpentor,Highly underrated and completely essential,10,11 February 2005,"Sometimes there comes across a movie that doesn't shatter your TV screen or expensive audio set with great special effects, overwhelmingly adventurous stories or mega epic blockbusters. Sometimes there comes across a movie that's overwhelming in a completely different manner, achieved through a cast that's devoted in the best possible way, a much more down to earth moving storyline and a meaningful soundtrack that never gets in the way with the actors.What's Eating Gilbert Grape really belongs to the latter kind of film. Since the rising popularity of (the then virtually unknown) Leonardo DiCaprio, much more people took a look at this production, which has got so much to offer it's a shame it hasn't received the kind of attention before. It really is pointless to go into the story of this film because there's so much to mention, so many moments pass along with great intensity and truthfulness that I can only recommend every viewer of this page to go and see this movie about a not so average American country family trying to make the best of the world they got dealt with. Darlene Cates makes a powerful impression as the much too fat mother of the family and Leonardo DiCaprio simply soars in one of the best parts ever captured on tape.Unbelievable how some films can give you a real, rich boost of emotion and energy without even using excessive Hollywood force to win everyone's hearts.

But before Arnie's birthday, Gilbert meets a new face in town and his daily routine begins to change. I liked this movie not because it had my favorite actor in it, it is because it has a touching tale about an ordinary family. It shows you that not all families are perfect. I also like it because it lets you know the characters and what they are going through. You get in the head of Gilbert Grape. It is a perfect movie for people who like plots like that.

The depth of each of the main characters is equal to or better than any major film (perhaps by Glengarry Glen Ross). This movie is also of tremendous value for clinical psychologists and psychological practitioners, especially those involved with family therapy. The subtle dynamics of a family living under distressful conditions is portrayed in this movie with awe-striking sensitivity, and it is a reminder of the sensitivity needed when working with families in general.

Like everyone else had said, DiCaprio is stunning. When I saw this movie as a little child I fell in love with Johnny Depp and that feeling have lasted until today and will probably do for a long time in the future.

Worried with the hero Depp and DiCaprio incredibly touching work. I think it's so hard to play a mentally retarded boy, but DiCaprio did it, I believed him absolutely.Wonderful movie, thin, shaped, very deep, hurt several strands of life. Do not even want to describe what he awakens in the soul. After viewing the remains light precipitate appears food for thought. The film shows the complicated social life, psychological problems of human relations in the family. The script is good, but sometimes the film is tightened, for about 15 minutes at the beginning could be removed. The plot is, in addition to all other problems, the problem of fathers and children. How often we are ashamed of their parents. They blurt out something random, something not to do so, is necessary for them to blush. Mentality they have not the same interests and ideals outdated. And Gilbert's mother at all like home, and his father hanged himself.Heavy, lingering story of a family in which the main victim of a desperate life is not sick boy who survived almost twice metered doctors period not sisters, driven into a maid almost from the cradle and not the same Gilbert, who dreams of escape from a small town where nothing occurs and never happen.This film I felt the first to the last frame. He has touched and excited me deeply. How uncharacteristic role Depp, DiCaprio is so incredible. Depp without his usual affectation at first glance may seem a little faded on the background DiCaprio. But this is only an illusion. To play Grape, ordinary young man without any aspirations and ideals, also need talent. I especially want to mention brilliant game DiCaprio. This is one of the busiest and brightest of his roles, which requires the talent, colloquially referred to as the actor's.The film is heavy, but the feeling after watching the highly positive.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape

287,brettwyatt,An Emotional Film,9,6 April 2016,"It's very seldom that a film comes along that can bring the true human emotion out of you and keep you entertained at the same time. This is exactly the case for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, where the main protagonist, Gilbert, played by Johnny Depp, has to deal with the aftermath of his father's death and trying to care of his mentally disabled brother, Arnie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his morbidly obese mother, played by Darlene Cates. Soon a girl named Becky, played by Juliette Lewis, springs up into town and catches the eye of Gilbert. The setting is the small fictional town of Endora, Iowa; Gilbert works for the town's slowly dying convenience store and he often makes deliveries to many of the locals around town. One of the locals that Gilbert consistently delivers to is Mrs. Carver. Played by Mary Steenburgen, whom plans on having an affair with Gilbert. The film is filled with emotion and it is interesting to see how the film is put together. Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio give great all around performances and they show great chemistry when on screen. Gilbert shows that he cares for Arnie and one quote that relates to this is when he says ""You don't hurt Arnie, you just don't."" This film is one that I would highly recommend anyone watch given the chance because What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a true classic.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
288,ssachinkr,Inspirational movie,10,15 August 2015,"This film is one of the best I've ever seen.Story is superb and full of inspiration.Lasse Hallström is the director of the movie. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for My Life as a Dog and later for The Cider House Rules. What's Eating Gilbert Grape was his first notable American success movie.This is the one of the best movie of Leonardo and Johnny Depp. Leonardo DiCaprio said that playing Arnie was ""the most fun I've ever had"".Lasse Hallström picked Johnny Depp to play Gilbert Grape because of the way he can express so much emotion through his face and eyes. Focusing on the angst of an unwanted small-town life, follows the daily life of Gilbert Grape(Johnny Depp). Gilbert Grape is a small-town young man with a lot of responsibility.He lived in Endora with his family.He had one younger brother, 2 sisters and widowed mother. He also had one older brother (Larry) who passed away. Gilbert himself has a career as a delivery boy, working in the small, outmoded grocery store. He has an ongoing affair with local woman Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen). His older sister (Amy) did lots of household work and she also used to manage the elementary school cafeteria until it burned down last year. His chief concerns was his overweight mother(Darlene Cates) who hasn't leave the house from a long time. His mentally-challenged brother,Arnie(Leonardo Dicaprio), steals the heart of the audience. Doctors said Arnie will not lived to be Ten,but now he was on eighteen. Gilbert's life is turned around by the unexpected introduction of Juliette Lewis's Becky. Becky's free-spirited and optimistic take on life greatly influence's Gilbert's own life. Everyone did everything they could to protect their mother and their disturbed brother from outside influences and hurt feelings. And They stuck together until the end which actually became the beginning. WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is deeply tragic yet deeply real tale of a complicated family stuck in a simple town. The performances of Johnny Depp, Leonardo Dicaprio, Darlene Cates and Juliette Lewis are unmatched and truly wonderful. It is a film mixed with comedy, drama, love and everyday emotion, perfected with beautiful cinematography and superb directing.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
289,info-5356,A great movie,8,7 August 2005,"Small towns, old trucks, and people in all their eccentricities are what this movie is about. That and a host of other human qualities; the highs and lows of human emotion are showcased in this nearly two-hour movie.Gilbert Grape is a kid growing up on a small farmstead in a prairie state where the sky rolls on forever. He is 'saddled' with a retarded younger brother he helps care for and a depressed mother who ballooned to obesity after the suicide of her husband. Two sisters round out this cast of 'misfit' family members.The casting and acting are superbly done, the array of acting skills by the two principals in the film Johnny Depp playing Gilbert Grape and Leonardo DiCaprio playing his younger brother Arnie Grape are so amazingly executed that I was a bit transfixed at the performance.It is a heartrending tearjerker, allow yourself some time to sit through the whole two hours to enjoy and absorb it all in.I suppose sometimes it is the way we can identify with characters in a story that make us connect with the tale in a deeper way. There are many people in this movie that the folks in a small town would see reflected in the daily life of their community. This is a good movie for the whole family to enjoy.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
290,bubblystevo,What's Starving Ability?- a breakdown of Tim Burton's best!,8,4 December 2015,"Some movies are predictable, but What's Eating Gilbert Grape truly breaks the limits of your expectations on what a good movie is. Nowadays, movies are either a slightly different take on a classic movie, or a predictable story line we have all seen a hundred times. This production didn't need to follow a grain, in that same sense, good movies don't follow any grain, but produce a new grain to be further followed. Likewise, with What's Eating Gilbert Grape,In one instant the simple reality of a family is changed. A girl comes into town, and ironically enough, brings chaos as well as clarity to the Grapes and their way of living.While watching this film I found myself asking not what's eating Gilbert grape, but, what defines who is and is not handicapped? There are dictionaries based around the conditions that can inhabit a person, each one with their own characteristics. What's Eating Gilbert Grape further establishes this concept into the sleeves of the real world, uncovering the truth in all humans, a trait we all have, and that is a handicap of our very own. From the opening scene to the credits, we are taken into the home of the Grapes, in the small town of Endora, and soon come to know the characters and their personalities as if they were our own flesh and blood. Most Importantly, there is Gilbert, the strong one, who brings home the bacon, provides for the family, and cares for his little brother Arnie, who has an intellectual disability. Although Arnie is incapable at times of achieving a task or completely understanding a concept, he breaks the criterion's based on him countless times, and through his ignorance of his handicapped, we too grow numb to where he falls short. In coming to know these characters and their predictable tomorrows, we are able to see the disabilities within the, so called, ""normal"" characters. There is the mother, who is trapped in her terrible eating habits, and forever confined to the sofa; from her condition, she is incapable of being the mother the family needs, therefore adding more to the plates of her children. Then there is Gilbert and his inability to think in terms of himself and what is best for him. All of this changes when Becky, the new girl, comes into town. In effect, Gilbert, for the first time ever, becomes aware of the dreams and future he could have, the things he could do with his life, and the love he has for Becky. With this groundbreaking discovery, Gilbert dives head first after the visions in his head. Putting his responsibilities on the back shelf, he falls in love, and starts seeing things in a different view. Soon enough, these unmet responsibilities catch up with him, and leave circumstances pleading for his call to action. Does he resort back to the person his family needs him to be, or does he go after the life he has now had a taste of?",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
291,snapshot-99468,A Never Forgettable Movie,9,1 November 2016,"An American drama movie based on the novel of the same name by Peter HedgesSynopsis: Gilbert Grape lives at home with two of his three sisters, Amy and Ellen, and one of his two brothers, Arnie. Arnie is mentally handicapped and depends on Gilbert for a lot. Then there's Gilbert's momma. She also lives with them and is perfectly huge. She was once the prettiest girl in Endora but now...is not. The whole Grape clan is just counting the days to Arnie's 18th birthday. The birthday the doctors said he would never see. Here Johnny Depp acted as Gilber and what i think is he was the perfect actor for this character. And Leonardo DiCaprio acted as Arnie. Both of their acting was marvelous but Leonardo DiCaprio oh boy he has shown a masterpiece acting skill in this movie. This movie is the proof that how much good an actor he was to began with. In this one his acting was even better than The Basketball Diary (One of his early days hit movies) IMO. Gilbert's dad, Mr. Grape, has been dead for 17 years and with his older brother gone everything falls on Gilbert's shoulders. He worked so hard to keep his family from sinking. I was touched by his responsibility and care for his family and the loving relationship with his mentally challenged brother Arnie. Gilbert is simply the supreme character of this movie. A great movie. Great story, well directed. Sometimes it will make you laugh,sometimes it will make you emotional or even it will make you angry now and then. And at the end this movie made me cry.(No it isn't a tragic movie)Leonardo DiCaprio received his first Academy Award nomination for his role.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
292,bsmackey-48572,"A quiet, patient film that delivers lasting rewards",9,8 August 2017,"I fully admit that I appreciate slower films more than most and that this definitely qualifies as a s-l-o-w film. That said, I'm still surprised at some of the excessively, over-the-top negative reviews here.It's already been pointed out, by many, that -- for the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio alone -- this film is worth checking out. And that's true. Like others, this was the first time I had ever seen him in anything and I remember thinking how amazing it was that they had cast a mentally challenged person in the film. He was/is that good in this.But, beyond that, I found the film uniquely touching in its portrayal of family and the limits that a community can sometimes put on those who are struggling to improve their lot in life and overcome those things that would bring us down. Inspiring.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
293,pauline_yingying,An interesting part of the movie,8,1 February 2006,"It was amusing when Gilbert's mother corrected him that he was, instead of a shining knight, a shimmering one. The word ""shining"" is usually used to describe heroes who are as bold and perfect as the sun, while ""shimmering"" is a better word for things that change quickly and slightly all the time. Light is reflected in different ways. Life is a combination of choices, and few mortals can score ""A+"" in this sheet of multiple choices. Gilbert was not Jesus, he might not always complete tasks as excellently and wholly as he was told. He had strengths and flaws. That's exactly why he had his own presentation of life. Yet no matter what steps he took, he never halted shimmering hope and pride for his own self, for his family, and for life itself as the best part of nature.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
294,hill-58147,Magical! Must Watch!,10,5 September 2019,"Wow. Wow is all I can say about this just beautiful movie. I watched this in Summer, during my movie marathon, and I am shocked by the fact that some people have never even seen this absolute classic.The main character in the movie is called Gilbert Grape, who is played by the wonderful Johnny Depp, who is struggling in his everyday life trying to take care of his family, consisting of two sisters, a morbidly obese mum and a heavily autistic little brother called Arnie Grape. He meets a girl who he instantly falls in love with, and also has that aspect of his life to take care of.The movie had many shocking moments, such as the time when Gilbert beat up Arnie in the bathroom. This hit me in so many different ways, as I do feel very bad for disabled people, so to see Arnie so upset after the beating, absolutely broke my heart.I couldn't recommend this movie any more to anyone of any age, as this is an instant classic with so many great moments all throughout the movie, with a heavily emotional finale to the movie.9.8/10 - Masterpiece.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
295,veridiana-44164,Beautiful story of 'nobody' in a small town,9,6 March 2018,"I am sure that What's Eating Gilbert Grape was excellently script written. The scene, characterisation, and dialog are the strength of this movie. The story of 'nobody' in a small town has become so interesting to watch. I think, Johnny Depp's act was good enough. Leonardo Di Caprio played very well as Arnie.
The scene when Gilbert bought a birthday cake at The Foodstand and met his boss at the entrance was great. It continued going to peak and made me cry when Gilbert was beating Arnie when he messed up his own birthday cake. ""You don't know how hard is...,"" Gilbert said. The movie ending is so unexpected and unforgettable.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
296,scorpionheroyj,A wonderful movie. Perfect for what it is,9,27 October 2018,"What's eating gilbert grape (1993)
I don't know where to start cause this movie ladies and gentlemen is nothing short of spectacular!
It's a movie about nothing and everything at the same time. I mean. It's just few days in the life of a young man and his family that lives in a small town. This makes it...let's say not that exciting but extremely relatable.It raises alot of philosophical questions such as: does everyone need a personal purpose or can other people and making their lives better be our purpose? And if these people are gone does that end our purpose or sets us free?The movie is also psychologically brilliant. It perfectly presents the state of mind of everyone in that town depending on their situation so even the minor characters are perfectly written and well acted.Now to acting
What attracted me to the movie was seeing a pic of young johnny depp and a really young leonardo dicaprio, searching it, then finding out that they made a movie together 25 years ago. At that moment i knew everything else on my list had to wait. And i was far from disappointed. I mean. Is Depp's acting ever anything less than an A+? And teen leo is still leo so the acting alone could've carried this movieOverall i'll give it 8.5. Highly recommended. One of the best realistic movies i've ever watched",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
297,tar24563,wonderful family drama,10,26 March 2006,"first time i watch film like this where boys/girls without alcohol-drug-sex problems in American life. this film really touching. I'm really respect the role of leodicaprio as a mentally handicapped arnie. what a such excellent boy. Gilbert play by johhny depp...wow, as a big brother in the house, he has to take care everything, especially to 'manage' his buddy arnie - he play a tough role. i tried to understand how disappointed he is when Arnie still with his 'naughty' behaviour that almost ruin his birthday preparation by his family members, especially his sister Amy. Tough Amy playing her role as a big sister, which also a 'Mom' in her family. Lucky Ellen didn't become as a trouble maker in this film, because usually 'there is always a 'monkey' in the house', but none of it in this film. I'm also feeling so happy looking at Endora people who shows their understanding of Gilbert & Arnie problem. The relationship between Gilbert & Arnie as a brother, what can i say....""too excellent"". bravo to all actor/actress in this film.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
298,elvencelticlady,"Excellent, moving and thought provoking. Johnny Depp on top form.",10,23 February 2006,"I loved this movie. Johnny Depp was excellent as Gilbert Grape, a young man trapped in a dead end life caring for his retarded brother and overweight mother. Leonardo Decaprio was also fantastic as Depp's younger brother. He played the part so well that although there was something familiar about him at the start of the movie - I didn't actually realise it was Leo playing the part until about 20 minutes into the film! The lady who played their mother wasn't even an actress - she was spotted on the Sally Jessy Raphael Show talking about her weight. She also gave a tremendous performance as the overweight housebound mother who is dependant on her children for everything. If you are a Depp or Decaprio fan, you must see this movie, but if you're not you will be by the end of the film. Excellent.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
