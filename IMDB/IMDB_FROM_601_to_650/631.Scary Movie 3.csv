0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not great, but it was quite fun in a way",6,15 July 2011,"I really liked the first movie, the second while lacking is in my opinion better than its reputation and I disliked the fourth one. The third instalment to the series is neither a great or a bad movie, just somewhere in between as well as being quite a fun movie. The script does have its funny moments but it isn't as fast-paced, witty or as laugh-a-minute as the first two, the story is thin and on the predictable side and the film isn't as efficiently directed and is uneven in pace being rushed one minute and a little too slow the next. The cast though give it their all, Anna Farris gives her best performance of the series, and Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielson are a lot of fun. There are some genuinely funny spoofs my favourites being The Ring and 8 Mile ones too, the production values are much more than cheap cheap to video fodder and the soundtrack is great. All in all, not great but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Scary Movie 3
1,Leofwine_draca,A different director and a big improvement,5,11 December 2016,"SCARY MOVIE 3 is a run-of-the-mill, fast-paced comedy spoof that will be familiar in style to any fans of director David Zucker's work. However, it's a shame that a lot of the gags here are extremely puerile and in bad taste, with silly slapstick being the order of the day. However, compared to the first two films in this series, this movie is a classic, with inventive humour and a wild imagination that makes it worth a watch. The film combines a number of films with little or no logic involved, so one minute it's spoofing 8 MILE, the next, SIGNS. There are numerous gags, in-jokes and references for film fans, with THE MATRIX RELOADED and THE RING also being prime candidates for the spoofery process. It also provides some surprisingly near-the-knuckle references, especially with the appearance of Michael Jackson, which has got to be one of the weirdest moments I've ever witnessed in cinema.The cast list is an amalgamation of actors and actresses, none of them new to comedy, but all the same providing a wide range of experience. The dreadful Anna Faris is back, unfortunately, and so is Regina Hall, although at least she gets bumped off this time. Elsewhere, we have Charlie Sheen as the dependable straight man, and the immensely likable Anthony Anderson as the token black guy (thankfully the Wayans brothers are long gone). There are plenty of amusing cameos from the likes of Simon Cowell (don't give up the day job), Pamela Anderson, and others. One of the brightest spots is the return of Leslie Nielsen to the genre, as funny as ever, particularly in the exhibition scene where he believes the people around him are alien. Plus, the jokes are so frequent that the viewer is likely to find at least SOME of them funny.The only thing which mars this film is the cheap finale, which proves to be a real letdown considering the build up. Watching the DVD extras, it becomes apparent why; all the money was spent on a better, SFX-filled alternate ending, which sadly was never used. Including as it does a fight between the Hulk and the aliens and a MATRIX spoof where Faris fights off millions of evil girls, it proves to be much better and essential viewing for anyone who enjoys what they see elsewhere. I can't say I'm looking forward to Part 4, but with Zucker at the helm again, I'll certainly be more inclined to watch it than I was the first or second.",Scary Movie 3
2,SnoopyStyle,a few random funny moments,5,27 October 2014,"There is a fun spoof of 'The Ring' to start this off. Farmer Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) and his brother George (Simon Rex) discover a crop circle, saying ""Attack Here!"" Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is now a TV anchorwoman who wants to do hard hitting news. Her psychic nephew Cody (Drew Mikuska) has her best friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) as his teacher. George's niece Sue has the same class. Cindy falls for George who is trying to win a rap battle.Old school David Zucker takes over from the Wayans. It's a lot of movie spoofs. There are some random funny moments. I still like Anna Faris as Cindy. I'm not so sure about Sheen. This was before his meltdown and I still had some trepidation about his comedy back then. The problem is that more jokes don't work rather than work. The few random funny jokes keep this from being a complete failure.",Scary Movie 3
3,claudio_carvalho,Shut Down Your Brain and Start Laughing,7,14 September 2004,"Parody movies are always of the type 'love or hate' it. I am not intellectual, I love cinema as culture, but also as entertainment, so I like them. Further, when I see this type of movie, I know exactly what I am going to see: scatological jokes, funny and surrealistic situations and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar. I found this 'Scary Movie 3' very funny. It satirizes mainly 'The Ring', followed by 'Signs', and part of '8 Miles' and one of these last two 'The Matrix' sequences. The last scene is a joke with 'Final Destination'. This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing. There are two scenes that I liked very much: when the moron George (Simon Rex) is in a club for Afro-Americans, wins the rap competition and covers his head with the hood of his coat. The other one, when Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) uses her laptop and many screens pops-up. In many sites, even in IMDb, there are some pops-up screens that irritate me. What I do not understand is some comments of persons that should never watch this type of movie. What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy / rent a DVD of 'Scary Movie 3', directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen in the cast? An art movie, with hidden messages, an epic, a classic or a film with politically correct jokes? Honestly, if I did not like this genre, I would never spend my time watching it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'Todo Mundo em Pânico 3' ('Everybody in Panic 3')",Scary Movie 3
4,kosmasp,Part 3 with Zucker,3,13 October 2013,"It's by Mr. Zucker, one of the ZAZ (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) Connection, but don't expect it to be near some of the classics the original trio conceived. The movie has some nice moments, but most jokes do not work. On the other hand, if you're a fan of Anna Faris (regular Scary Movie alumni until Part 4), you might want to add a few extra points or at least one that is.Of course even here it makes sense to know the movies that are spoofed in here. Ring being one of them, Pamela Anderson ""home video"" another. While not a great skit, this almost seems like the joke of the century though compared to Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to poke fun at themselves! You might expect Pam Anderson to be better than Lohan as an actress, but you could expect Charlie to be better than that. Maybe he was running low on fuel ... Anyway, better than other spoof movies, but not really great",Scary Movie 3
5,Sleepin_Dragon,The hilarious third instalment never stops being funny.,9,5 February 2018,"Scary Movie three is arguably the last high rating parody movie made, what followed generally seemed to lack the sharp writing and down right laughs. The source material was perfect for parody, the best material arguably coming from The Ring and Signs. As always the film is relentless in its ability to offend every demographic without offering any genuine malice. Pamela Anderson starts off proceedings, I am a huge fan of hers, and her ability to poke fun at herself, a fun performance too. The best elements for me are The Ring parodies, each absolutely hilarious, Cindy's visit to Aunt ShaNeequa never fails to have me in tears laughing, the first time I saw that I could barely breathe.Fine performances, Anna Faris, Charlie Sheen, Leslie Nielsen and Simon Rex all equally hilarious, great timing. A shame Regina Hall seemed to have a smaller role.Hilarious.",Scary Movie 3
6,lee_eisenberg,"a ""signs"" of ""rings"" to come",10,25 April 2006,"My 10/10 rating assumes that you decided that you like ""Scary Movie 3"" before you saw it. And it doesn't disappoint. Spoofing ""Signs"", ""The Ring"" and ""8 Mile"" (among other things), it's another gag-a-minute comedy from the director of ""Airplane!"". But how could it not be, starring Leslie Nielsen? I think that my favorite scene was either the part with Simon Cowell, or the news room scene (I'd like to try that someday).In conclusion, just remember that ""SM3"" is a joke. Anna Faris reprises her role as Cindy Campbell (so she has these movies to her resume, as well as ""Brokeback Mountain""). The rest of the cast includes Charlie Sheen as the farmer discovering crop circles, and various people have small roles. Remember, all completely silly.",Scary Movie 3
7,jboothmillard,Scary Movie 3,4,21 June 2005,"I did used to like the Scary Movie films in a rather immature way, now only the first film is the one I can say good things about, because as they go on the sequels get worse and worse, and the spin off films from the same makers, e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie and Vampires Suck are abysmal, this was the third film in the near pointless continuing horror films, television and popularised celebrity news spoof series. This film predominantly parodies the science-fiction and psychological horror films, specifically Signs and The Ring (remake of the Japanese film), as well as spoofing or referencing The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Sixth Sense, Minority Report, 8 Mile, American Idol, The Matrix, The Others, Living with Michael Jackson, Bruce Almighty, The Faculty, The Matrix Reloaded, Jeopardy!, Air Force One, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Airplane!, The Crying Game and Gothika. Basically the film opens with Katy (Jenny McCarthy) and Becka (Pamela Anderson) watching television and then talking about a cursed video tape, it apparently kills people seven days after watching it, and they experience paranormal events before both dying. It then moves to the farm of Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) where large crop circles have been formed in the field and from above it is a large arrow with the words ""ATTACK HERE"", and Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) who has become a news reporter is looking to cover more of the story, but her boss wants more of her stories about sex and violence, and she also has to look after her paranormally endowed nephew Cody (Drew Mikuska). Tom's clumsy son George (Simon Rex) has a dream to be a star rapper, and with friends Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) he enters a rap battle, with Cindy, as they are smitten with each other, and Cindy's reunited friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) watching, he has good talent, but he trips himself up again with a racist blunder. That night Cindy spends the evening with Brenda who wants company, and after telling her that she watched a cursed video tape a week ago and plays some pranks on her, she goes to the lounge for popcorn, and the television turns on with evil dead girl Tabitha (Marny Eng) climbing out and eventually killing her, and George tells his niece Sue (Jianna Ballard) in a very inappropriate way that her teacher is dead. Tom meets Sayaman (Ajay Naidu) who reminds him of the night he accidentally killed his wife Annie (Denise Richards, then Sheen's real wife), and after the chaotic wake of Brenda, where her body is blown up, Cindy finds the video tape that is cursed, and like the other victims she is called by the evil voice to say she will die in seven days, and to help the situation CJ suggests she visits Aunt Shaneequa aka The Oracle (Queen Latifah) and her husband Orpheus (Eddie Griffin) for answers. Having caught Cody watching the video she investigates lighthouses like on the video, and on the news she tries to warn viewers about the danger of the video tape, and following this the Logans come to the conclusion they are definitely being invaded by aliens, and it may have a connection to the video, and President of the United States, President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen) knows that Cindy Campbell may know what to do. Visiting The Architect (George Carlin) he explains he is the father of dead girl Tabitha and the evil video imprinted her curse and it got out because of a mistake, and she then goes to the Logan farm where she finds Cody is hiding with the family to hide from the aliens coming to Earth. The aliens turn out to be good and are cursed themselves by the video, so they came to stop the evil, and Tabitha is defeated being pushed back down the well she drowned in by President Harris wishing the couple luck, and in the end Cindy and George are married, and Cody is hit by a car. Also starring Jeremy Piven as Ross Giggins, Darrell Hammond as Father Muldoon, Simon Cowell, Fat Joe, Master P, Macy Gray, Redman, Method Man, Raekwon, RZA and U-God. The film is only a little reminiscent of the classic spoof films, like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, and not just because director David Zucker is involved, the character stupidity is on a lighter level, the ridiculousness is amusing, the gross and disgusting material is thankfully not very high, Cindy is clumsy and accident prone in a less annoying way, as the only other returning character Brenda is alright as well, Sheen is a good choice having been in Hot Shots!, and Nielsen is of course likable as the heightened George W. Bush like President. You may recognise the films being parodied, but the jokes can be repetitive and predictable, the story is a bit more worked out, it is certainly more worthwhile than the previous film, the same sadly can't be said for one or two of the other sequels in the series, a disappointing but fair horror comedy spoof film. Okay!",Scary Movie 3
8,ma-cortes,Spoof movie with a myriad of unimaginative gags,5,19 May 2006,"This third chapter deals about Cindy(Anna Faris)who must to protect a kid and relates with his brother,a white rapper(Simon Rex)and the father(Charlie Sheen).Besides investigate strange crop circles and eerie videotapes and shunning an Alian invaders with the intervention of the stupidest President(Leslie Nielsen).Cindy is back ,this time to save America from a plot Alien invasion for world domination.She thwart the plans and saves the kid from a ghostly creature.From the start to the ending the humor and the laughters are innumerable. Lots of gags and sketch,some of them funny but movie lacks the freshness of the first and second installment. This is a hilarious parody,surrealist,extreme spoof and gross out though less than its predecessors but also is intelligent and bold. As always the cinematographic references are numerous and provide silly laughs from start to finish,the amusement is guess what films result to be ,thus : ¨Sings¨and ¨The ring¨ specially but also ¨8 miles¨¨The others¨with a ironic gag of Michael Jackson,and with a President(a deadpan Nielsen) similar to ¨Air Force One¨. The picture contains loads of fun here and there and a passel of cameo appearances as Pamela Anderson,Jenny McCarthy,Queen Latifah,Eddie Griffin and rappers,JA Rule,Master P,Method man. The movie is directed by David Zucker,he along with his brother Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams are famous American satirists(ZAZ),they are directors and writers with successful work and long time collaborators,making their own comedy troupe(The Kentucky Fried).

9,BA_Harrison,Sucky Movie 3,2,7 July 2011,"The third film in a trilogy is often considered to be the worst, so considering how lousy the first two Scary Movies were, I wasn't getting my hopes up too high for Scary Movie 3. Sure enough, part three proved to be a thoroughly woeful effort, completely devoid of laughs despite being directed by one of the 'big names' in the spoof genre, David Zucker.Although Zucker might have seemed an obvious choice to inject some real belly laughs into the Scary Movie franchise, without the help of co-director Jim Abrahams, with whom he created box office hits Airplane and The Naked Gun, the poor guy is clearly way out of his depth. The first two films barely managed a handful of decent giggles between them, but this one is a 100% mirth-free zone; I sat stony-faced the whole way through as Zucker and his cast of washed-up has-beens (including Charlie Sheen, Pamela Anderson, and Leslie Nielsen) went through the spoof-movie motions, delivering every tired trick in their predictable repertoire of slapstick and 'crazy' visual gags.And as if the total absence of genuine humour wasn't bad enough, the series' appealing brunette star Anna Faris had become a blonde! (raises arms to the sky and screams 'Noooooooo!!!!).I give Scary Movie 3 a rating of 2/10 (in all honesty, it should really be a 1/10, but I want to leave myself room to give an even lower rating to part 4 should it be worse).",Scary Movie 3
10,Coventry,Not even a decent cast and crew can save an exhausted topic,4,2 January 2004,"The genre of parody is long dead...that's a simple but undeniable determination when you're looking at the nowadays movies like this Scary Movie 3. These kind of movies are supposed to be barrage of funny sequences and a variety of subtle and more explicit humour. Scary Movie 3 doesn't come much further than a few forced laughs. I guess fans of this kind of comedy have to face the fact that movies like Hot Shots! or The Naked Gun will never again be made. Not to mention the earlier work of maestro Mel Brooks ( Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein )...we'll never see new movies like that again. Nevertheless, Scary Movie 3 will become a huge success. It contains the names of stars who made this sub genre of cinema so popular. David Zucker, Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen, Pat Proft...these people don't have to convince us anymore. Derived from their earlier work, we know they're talented, but they just can't make anything out of this exhausted franchise. The ""jokes"" are limited to the characters falling down and literally copying scenes from Signs, The Ring and 8 mile. Some of the sequences are so embarrassing and unfunny that I really wonder how on earth they made it till the final cut. And even though I know the structure and plot aren't important in this kind of movies, the attempt to give a little draught to the story is really pathetic. All the different storylines and characters are connected by extremely thin wires and, even for a parody, this is pretty low. Yet, there are a few positive aspect I should mention as well, though. Leading actress Ana Faris becomes a better actress ( and prettier ) in every episode. By the time they shoot Scary Movie 7, she'll be an adequate star. Other than that, Scary Movie contains a few amusing cameo's and smaller roles by decent actors ( Jeremy Piven, George Carlin ). And - last but not least - it was a great pleasure to see Charlie Sheen again on the big screen. Too bad it was in an inferior product, but still...most of his recent movies went straight to video and, as a fan, it was good to see him again. In conclusion...Don't expect a huge improvement over the previous two scary movies just because the Wayans brothers didn't direct. No matter how talented the cast is, none of them can save this movie from boredom and déjà vu feelings. Next !",Scary Movie 3
11,michaelRokeefe,A comedy franchise chuckles on.,4,30 November 2006,"The satirical comedy franchise continues as Cindy Campbell(Anna Faris), working as a reporter for a TV station interested only in T & A, looks for hard stories out of crop circles and deadly video tapes. This third installment of SCARY MOVIE spoofs hit movies like SIGNS and THE RING. Comic violence galore with lewd and crude sexual humor gets a pervasive PG-13 rating. My favorite sequence is with Brenda(Regina Hall)in her casket. What really spoiled the movie for me was the Rap crap. To each his own. Leslie Nielsen is hysterical as the inept President. And Charlie Sheen shines while in comic mode.David Zucker directs.

13,poolandrews,"""If you think that's strange you should see how we pee."" OK sequel.",6,27 March 2007,"Scary Movie 3 starts as two girls Becca (Pamela Anderson) & Kate (Jenny McCarthy) discuss a videotape that supposedly kills you after one week, having watched the tape themselves a week ago they end up dead... TV news reporter Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) is on the case, she is also investigating the appearance of strange crop circles in local corn fields. Could the two be linked somehow...Directed by David Zucker I thought this was the weakest of the first three Scary Movie comedy spoofs. The script by Pat Proft & Craig Mazin seems to tone things down a lot as represented by the PG-13 rating in the US a lowly 15 rating here in the UK, gone are the gross sexual gags, the crude toilet humour & jokes about the disabled that I personally think made Scary Movie 2 (2001) so funny & politically incorrect. This one could be called slightly racist at times but otherwise it's quite tame stuff, it's still quite amusing at times & does have it's funny moments including a funny bit involving Pamela Anderson at the start saying 'no, not that tape...' in an obvious reference to the sex tape she made with Tommy Lee & one when a news reporters autocue is tampered with & a disgruntled black janitor types in some funny stuff for him to say on air but overall I felt it's definitely lost it's edge & the dialogue isn't that funny or quotable. As expected it spoofs many films in particular The Ring (2002), Signs (2002), The Sixth Sense (1998) & The Matrix (1999). At only 80 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace & it entertains if you switch your brain off if nothing else.This time around this one is changes it's principle production team, a different director & writers from the previous two you can sense Zucker's influence for silly light hearted fun rather than bad taste humour just like his Naked Gun (1988 - 1994) films which are similar in tone. All I will say is if it ain't broke don't fix it. There are as many unsubtle homages, references & spoofs of other films as you care to mention & a merciless sending-up of Michael Jackson which I didn't find funny at all.I am amazed this cost a whopping $45,000,000 as it doesn't look like it, but then again what do I know. It's well made but nothing really stands out. There's a good cast here including Charlie Sheen, Denise Richards, Leslie Nielsen & of course Simon Cowell makes a fun cameo appearance as seen in all the trailers for it.Scary Movie 3 is the weakest of the first three Scary Movie films, I haven't seen Scary Movie 4 (2006) & Scary Movie 5 (2008) obviously isn't out yet. Worth a watch as it provides silly, dumb entertainment but where's all the filthy toilet humour & crude sexual gags?",Scary Movie 3
14,lastliberal,I found their weakness. They're powerless without their heads!,6,13 May 2007,"I really don't know what to say about this film. Somehow I managed to miss all these Scary Movie movies and I guess I didn't have anything else to do, so I watched.I say watched, because I didn't heard a thing the first what 10 minutes as I stared at Pamela Anderson. Those babies must have been squeezed tight as I never realized she was so big! I recognized Signs and The Matrix. I have not seen The Ring, but I knew the symbol. I understand it is also a spoof of 8 Mile, but I haven't seen that either, so I don't know.Basically, it is just one corny joke after another - some funny; some not.Man, I just didn't know she was that big!",Scary Movie 3
15,zardoz-13,"Director David Zucker has redeemed himself with ""Scary Movie 3""",8,29 July 2007,"No, the new ""Scary Movie"" sequel ""Scary Movie 3"" doesn't scare up half as many laughs as the original ""Scary Movie."" Neither does it raunch out to the ultra-extremes of ""Scary Movie 2."" If you laughed aloud at the first two ""Scary Movies,"" you'll probably howl just as hard but in fewer places and for different reasons. Although ""Scary Move 3"" doesn't send up slasher movies, it mercilessly pokes fun at horror movies that coined big bucks at the box office. If you haven't seen big-screen blockbusters like ""Signs,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""8-Mile,"" ""The Ring,"" ""The Others,"" and ""The Matrix,"" you may find yourself wondering what is so funny?""Scary Movie 3"" differs in other ways from its outrageous antecedents. The Motion Picture Association of America impaled both ""Scary Movie"" (2000) and ""Scary Movie 2"" (2001) on R-ratings, while they gave the slightly more sanitized ""Scary Movie 3"" a benign PG-13 rating. Principally, ""SM3"" bypasses scenes depicting the use of illegal drugs and grossed-out gags about sexual body fluids. Furthermore, statistics accentuate the difference. ""Scary Movie"" spouted the F word at least 20 times, and ""SM 2"" uttered it as many as 26 times. Comparatively, ""SM 3"" blurts out the F word only once! Interestingly enough, ""Scary Movie"" used the S word 29 times; ""SM 2"" used it 26 times, and ""SM 3"" used it 21 times. Keenen Ivory Wayans of ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka"" fame directed the first two ""Scary Movies,"" and he didn't push the envelope on social issues & themes as much as eviscerate it. After the whirlwind production schedule of the uneven, but entertaining ""SM 2,"" Wayans bade good-bye to the franchise his brothers and he had created.Brilliantly, Miramax replaced Wayans with David Zucker. Along with Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, David forged the movie spoof genre in the1980s with ""Airplane."" Zucker followed up ""Airplane"" with ""Top Secret,"" starring Val Kilmer, and then helmed the insanely funny first and third Leslie Nielsen entries in ""The Naked Gun"" trilogy. Comparatively, ""Scary Movie 3"" contains only half as many of the usually tasteless and offensive jokes, and the comedy doesn't seem quite as weak. Okay, they make fun of the lethal videotape in ""The Ring"" by showing a bare-bottomed guy sitting down on 'the ring' or getting up off it. The another difference between ""SM 2"" and ""SM 3"" is Wayans mocked current social ideas, such as the radical ideology of some handicapped people, while Zucker aims for the funny bone, for the sake of amusement without any need to espouse an ideology.Actresses Anna Faris of ""The Hot Chick"" and Regina Hall of ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" are the only survivors from the first two ""Scary Movies."" In the previous ""Scary Movies,"" Faris played Cindy Campbell, a vacuous brunette ""Scream"" queen based loosely on Neve Campbell. In ""SM 3,"" Faris turns blond to play a TV journalist modeled on the Naomi Watts heroine in ""The Ring."" Like Watts' character, Cindy raises a young boy, her nephew Cody (newcomer Drew Mikuska), who carbon copies the omniscient urchin in the Bruce Willis chiller ""The Sixth Sense."" Literally, in one of the film's running jokes, Cindy (Anne Faris) keeps forgetting to open the door for Cody when she picks him up from school. Realizing her error too late after she has driven away and left him at school, she slings her car into reverse and slams backwards into him as he charges toward her. Poor Cody goes flying through the air like a football. Not only can Cody tell the future, but also he becomes the target of any flying implements. Meanwhile, Regina plays Brenda Meeks, Cody' s teacher, and Cindy's chum. Sadly, one of these two survivors dies before fade-out. Anyway, Cindy investigates an urban legend about a mysterious, supernatural videotape that reputedly kills the viewer seven days after they watch it. Cindy tries to convince her boss to let her cover the story, but he has no faith in the story as a rating winner.The second major ""SM 3"" plot concerns former-priest-turned-farmer Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen of ""Hot Shots"") who discovers crop signs in his cornfields. Seen from above, the crop sign near Tom's farm spells out: ATTACK HERE with an arrow pointed at his house. At the same time that Tom confronts the mystery of the crop signs, his younger brother George (Simon Rex) dreams of being a rapper like Eminem. Predictably, the bubble-headed aliens arrive, and the dead girl with slimy hair and a cadaverous body emerges from the videotape to do battle with our heroes and heroines. Director David Zucker keeps the jokes, gags, one-liners, and slapstick flying thick and fast with no let-up during this 81-minute epic. The incredibly coherent script by Pat Proft of the ""Hot Shots!"" and ""Naked Gun"" movies and Kevin Smith of ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy,"" does a better-than-average job of integrating the crop-signs plot with the deadly videotape plot. Leslie Neilson excels in a cameo as a paranoid U.S. President who insists aliens are masquerading as humans. After making one of the worst films of his career--""The Boss's Daughter,"" director David Zucker has redeemed himself with ""Scary Movie 3,"" a spoof that is not only pretty funny, but also has set a new record for box office admissions in October when originally appeared in theatres.",Scary Movie 3
16,Boba_Fett1138,Zucker taking over this time.,5,27 October 2009,"This is the first movie out of the franchise that got made without the involvement of the Waynes brothers. This time the movie is being directed by David Zucker, one of the men who basically invented and perfected the spoof genre. He has however lost his touch a bit the last couple of years, even though his movies still always contain more than a couple of hilarious moments, this movie included.I must say that this was my least favorite out of the series so far. It doesn't has so much to do with the humor itself of the movie but more with the handling of the story and characters this time. I think that the movie made a mistake by not restraining itself by purely spoofing horror movies but also tons of other movies this time. It gives the movie a more of an Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer feeling and quality at times, which just isn't the best. The movie can't really seem to decide if it wants to continue on the same way as the previous two movies did, or to take a whole different direction. It makes the end result a rather mixed one. Yes, the movie is still being funny to watch but movie-wise it just isn't a very well executed one. The movie introduces mostly some new characters but yet it also decide to feature characters from the previous movies. I feel that the movie would had worked out better if it would had just left out the characters from the first two movies and had just purely focused on the new ones, since they were obviously good and fun enough to carry the movie on their own. Now you more or less have two movies and story-lines, on which one focuses on some of the old characters from the first two movies, while the other is purely about the new ones. They try to connect the different story lines to each other by blending them in with each other but this just never works out very well.Charlie Sheen is the main new big man of the movie. He plays a large part and shows that he still knows how to do a comedy. Also Leslie Nielsen returns into a David Zucker movie again, as the American president. When he's given the right material Nielsen is of course still quite hilarious, though he's starting to age pretty fast now, as became obvious in this movie.Still a fun movie to watch but also more a mess than the previous two movies were.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Scary Movie 3
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,One of the better spoof movies,6,10 February 2004,"As I watched Scary Movie 3, I dreaded the thought of this one being as bad as the first two. I was very relieved when the gags started, and the room filled with laughter. This one is a lot better than most other spoof movies I've seen, and unlike the first two scary movies, actually has a plot, instead of just being an hour and a half full of gags. That's not to say that there are no gags, there are plenty, and most of them are hilarious. A few of the jokes fall flat, but most of them are great. The plot is a mix of some popular newer movies, including; 8 Mile, The Ring, The Others, Signs, etc. The characters are also taken from those movies, which allows for some good spoofing of several of the movies as well as characters. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys spoof movies and has seen at least one of the films it parodies. All in all, it couldn't have done a much better job spoofing those films while bringing the plot forward. There are just a little too many jokes that fall flat or let down the audience. Not the greatest spoof movie, but up there with the best. 6/10",Scary Movie 3

His younger brother off competing in the rap wars in a reference to Eight Mile. The premise is different but it regards the usual spoofs of mainstream movies including the ominous figure emerging from the well in The Ring. Directed by David Zucker who previously made one of the worst comedies ever in My Boss's Daughter. Charlie Sheen is well cast as farmer Logan who will have an encounter with an alien molded in the likeness of Michael Jackson. Denise Richards appears as his wife in the fatal accident. This is another reference to Signs but unfortunately there just isn't enough of Richards. Anna Faris returns as Cindy and now she's a newswoman. She investigates and comes away a married woman. Leslie Nielsen plays the United States President who sense conspiracy and he accidentally solves the plot problem in a manner of classic Nielsen. Simon Rex plays Sheen's younger brother who is subjected to brutal prat falls. Vulgar as expected but takes the narrative in a new warped direction. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Scary Movie 3
19,movieman_kev,can't even hope to lick the boots of earlier Zucker spoofs,4,25 May 2005,"Third in the series of ""Scary Movie"" films and the first without the Wayne brothers, and after the horrendous Scary Movie 2 perhaps that is a good thing. Instead David Zucker take the reigns. The results are better than SM2, but still pretty bad. I think i chuckled once or twice. Neither of those times was at anything Anna Faris said or did though. Anthony Anderson is pretty much wasted, that's a shame cause the cat CAN act pretty well (don't believe me? Catch any episode of him as Atwon Mitchell on ""The Shield"" especially the 90 minute episode #51 ""Back in the Hole"") And as for why I didn't get into the plot it's because it really doesn't matter in this movie.My Grade: D+ DVD Extras: Commentary by David Zucker, Robert Weiss, Craig Mazin, and Pat Proft; 10 awful deleted scenes; 23 minute Makin of; 5 minute making of parody; Bloopers; behind the scenes of the alternative ending; 3 Trailers for ""the Osburnes"" and a Dimension compilation trailer",Scary Movie 3
20,Aaron1375,"Pretty good, but it could have been better.",7,12 January 2004,"I thought this one was rather funny, I liked it a tiny bit more than the first one (didn't see the 2nd), but that is probably because I saw all the movies they made fun of with the exception of ""8 Mile"".  The problem is once again this movie isn't going to be very good if you haven't seen ""The Ring"" or ""Signs"" the two main ones they made fun of therefore it is not really a stand alone movie.  You can miss ""8 Mile"" though as anything you saw in the previews of that one would be all you need.  These ""Scary Movies"" and the last few parodies made really require you to see movies before you can enjoy.  That just was not the case with movies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"", sure there were a few references that might of helped too  if you saw the movie, but not a whole lot as it was stand alone funny.  This movie mainly makes fun of ""The Ring"", there are some funny jokes here, but for my money the funniest stuff came at the expense of ""Signs"".  The Ring probably made up 50 percent or more of the jokes with Signs at around 30 percent and ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""8 Mile"" making the remainder.  There is one small joke that is Lord of the Rings related, but it isn't anything really funny.  There was supposed to be something in it making fun of the Hulk, but I am pretty sure it was cut because I didn't notice anything. Which leads to another complaint, why the heck did they make the movie so short?  This movie had to be an hour and twenty minutes max, you're telling me they couldn't find anything else to spoof?  I really hate going to a movie that is under an hour and thirty minutes.  Overall though it was an okay movie with some good laughs here and there.",Scary Movie 3
21,mm-39,They showed all the good stuff on the trailer,6,1 November 2003,"Spoiler They showed all the good stuff on the trailer.  Shouldn't ruined it for us the viewer.  Anyways ok but predictable.  I like the phone part.  "" This is readers""  good line.  I wish there was more to this movie, but there isn't.  I would rent it.  I like the tv part too It's Ok 6 out of 10!",Scary Movie 3
22,Smells_Like_Cheese,They still got it,10,27 October 2003,"The brilliant creators of ""Airplane"" bring us back to the non-stop slap stick comedy of ""Scary Movie 3"". In my opinion, this is my favorite Scary Movie out of the three so far, this was just too much for words to say how funny it was. I never had such a good time in the theater, I even saw it 3 times because I just couldn't get enough laughs.The movies are now: Signs, 8 Mile, The Others, The Ring, and The Matrix movies. We have two old friends, Anna Farris back as Cindy and Regina Hall back as Brenda. We have a new and more fun cast with Leislie Neilson, Charlie Sheen, Denese Richards, Simon Rex, and the two that stole the movie Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart. Together they brought together a movie that would not stop with the great comedy. Despite it being a very short movie, it makes you just want to watch it again and again.I'm not sure which was my favorite parody, I think it was either the rap battle where Simon plays George as Eminem in 8 Mile and they had that great cameo of Simon from American Idol. Of course, I enjoyed the Michael Jackson joke, I just was dying of that line ""How do you like it, huh?"" representing Michael dangling his baby in Berlin earlier this year and now Charlie Sheen gets the chance to give Michael his own medicine. Every scene is a great one, trust me, this is by far the best Scary Movie. You'll have a great time.10/10",Scary Movie 3
23,=G=,I didn't think this movie was very scary.,6,11 May 2004,"If you liked ""Scary Movie"" or the sequel ""Scary Movie 2"", you'll probably enjoy this somewhat lesser installment of the series.  If you haven't seen SM or SM2, you should watch them in chronological order before spending time with SM3. Though SM3 lacks some of the serious slams of its predecessors, it still features Faris as the spacey airhead who's out to get to the bottom of the scariness while spoofing other scary and not-so-scary movies such as ""8 Mile"", ""The Ring"", ""Signs"", ""Children of the Corn MDCVII"", etc. Nielsen and Sheen work well while Anderson and the twins, McCarthy, and Rex pretty much suck with the rest of the cast somewhere in between. SM3 is typically inane, always busy, unabashedly silly,  and nonstop nonsense not for the jaded or sophisticated comedy palate. (C+)",Scary Movie 3

25,OllieSuave-007,Best of the Scary Movie films!,9,15 June 2007,"I think this movie is the best of the Scary Movie films. It's one hilarious scene after the other, with Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) trying to undercover the origins of a mysterious videotape while her new love interest George (Simon Rex) try to solve the mystery behind some crop circles and the alien invasion. Somehow, the videotape and alien invasion are connected, and you'll have to watch this movie to find out how. There are a host of movies spoofed in this funny epic, including The Ring, Signs, 8 Mile, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Others. They are all executed well, with more slapstick, yet witty comedy then the previous two films, and more fun for the entire audience, not just adults. Faris, Rex, Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Queen Latifah, Regina King, Leslie Nielson and Drew Mikuska were all great. Even Michael Jackson makes a surprise appearance. The only downside to this film was that the love interest relationship between Cindy and George were not emphasized enough. Aside from that, a outrageous piece of comedy.Among my favorite scenes are George and Mahalik try to revive an apparently lifeless Brenda by beating the crap out of her; Tom dangling Michael Jackson over the balcony (a test of his own medicine); Brenda saying ""The TV's leaking"" as Tabitha's ghost comes out of it and Tabitha's ghost calling Cindy telling her she's going to die in 7 days; Cindy doesn't hear her and asks, ""What, Willie May? Who's Gay?"" So, if you are in need of some laughs and some good popcorn time, watch this film.Grade A-",Scary Movie 3
26,cherold,as far as I'm concerned they can just keep making these forever,7,6 December 2004,"I never have any confidence the latest Scary Movie will be good. The first one got bad reviews so I didn't see it until it hit cable, and it was hilarious. I saw comments of Scary Movie 2 that, yeah, loved the first one, but this one sucked, so I didn't see it until cable and it was hilarious. By which time I'd decided to ignore what anyone else said, until I heard this one had a different director and writers, which caused me to once again wait until it hit cable. And it's pretty hilarious, although perhaps not quite as much so as the first two.These movies are all pretty hit and miss, so there are plenty of misfires, most notably an absolutely atrocious scene at a wake, but the movie is often outrageously funny, taking clever jabs at the most popular thrillers since the last Scary Movie came out. Fairly consistently funny and doesn't reach quite as low as often for humor as the previous movie. If you liked the previous movies I would expect you to like this one, and if you hated the previous movies I would expect you to hate this one.",Scary Movie 3
27,bowmanblue,A reasonable excuse for a parody,6,23 February 2015,"Scary Movie 3 is the latest in a long line of 'parody' films which lampoon either a specific film, or a genre in general. This time the franchise takes a pop at (horror classic) 'The Ring' and (sci-fi thriller) 'Signs.' The original Scary Movie was primarily lampooning Scream, which allowed the film to follow a single plot line effectively. However, now it tries to merge two different films together, the jokes (most of which are 'hits' as opposed to 'misses') may be there, but the story seems a little jumbled.It's generally the opinion that Part 3 of the franchise is not as good as the first, but largely better than the second. If you're a fan of the series, then you probably know what you're in for, or if you'd like to see either Signs or The Ring poked fun at, then this might be the one for you.Although, most of the main laughs come from the over-the-top hurting of a small boy (it's funnier than it sounds, honestly).",Scary Movie 3
28,dromasca,"Parody of some latest flicks, quite funny",6,6 June 2004,"When you rent films like 'Scary movie' you should know what to expect - comedy of situations, continuous series of gags, under-the belt humor, and in this case a lot of quotes  from other films. 'Scary Movie 3' is mostly a parody, making fun of some of the big screen movies that were successful in the last few years. It works quite well - I have seem most if not all the movies quoted by SC3, and enjoyed many of the gags. Unfortunately, there is no hysterical laugh, but there are a lot of good jokes and funny ideas - like casting Leslie Nielsen as the ultimate US president. Anna Farris is good looking and has real comedy skills, I am looking forward to seeing her in other movies. Charlie Sheen looked a little bored, but so were we watching 'Signs'. In any day but a bad one, you should enjoy this film.  7 out of 10 on my personal scale. One more thing - if you watch it on DVD, look for the alternate ending. It is at least as good as the one that was left in the official version. It is actually much more than just an ending, it is a full different last quarter of the film.",Scary Movie 3
29,MLDinTN,At least it wasn't as nasty as the others since it's pg-13,5,8 December 2004,"This movie was OK for what it was. I only laughed once and that was when the news anchor was reading all the crazy things off the teleprompter. The opening scene with Pam Anderson and Jenny McCarthy was good also. Many of the jokes fell flat, but it is humorous just to see Charlie Sheen in movies like this. The plot resembles a cross between the Ring and Signs. Of course, it makes no sense, but it doesn't need to. It was also kind of funny the parts where they are showing the aliens on the news. They set it up like in Signs, but in this the aliens are hanging out, drinking with people like the people don't even notice them.FINAL VERDICT: You know it is very silly and has stupid jokes. So, if you like that, I recommend it; otherwise, don't watch it.",Scary Movie 3

After so many times of watching this, I still laugh hard as I can. The jokes here are never old. I loved the cameos and I was thrilled to see the beautiful Anna Faris return. I was also happy to see Charlie Sheen.This spoofs many movies such as 8 Mile, Signs, and the Ring. It tells the story of Cindy Crawford after she gets out of college and starts her professional career as a TV anchor.My favorite scenes had to be Leslie Nielsen as President. In reality, I don't think anyone would vote for him. He's so dim-witted and that is what makes this movie even funnier.Overall, this is my favorite spoof movie and it should hold that title for a long time. I rate this film 10/10.",Scary Movie 3

32,callanvass,Fitfully amusing with some laughs if in the right frame of mind,5,26 August 2013,"Scary Movie officially entered into the realm of P.G, but I actually thought it was relatively OK for what it was. You get what you deserve when you decide to watch these movies (Except for Scary Movie 2; nobody deserves that on their worst day) It spoofs things like Signs, The Ring, and even 8 Mile, and manages to connect them altogether. Familiar faces such as Charlie Sheen, Pamela Anderson & Jenny McCarthy (relegated to cameos in the beginning) and Leslie Nielsen show up here and it was a lot of fun to see. The old dependable like Anna Farris & Regina Hall deliver big time. Anna did her usual shtick and it was a delight to watch whilst her chemistry with Regina was on. Charlie Sheen also does this all with a straight face and he was a hoot! Gotta love Charlie; Simon Rex is hilarious as our awkward hero George. Drew Mikuska is in many of my favorite scenes. He was a riot as Anna Farris's kid. Anthony Anderson & Kevin Hart didn't add much to the proceedings in my view, though. I also didn't find the 8 mile spoof very funny at all. It came across as extremely flat. A lot of the movie did, but it also had its share of hits as well. Keep an eye out for a Denise Richards cameo. Final Thoughts: I thought it was OK for what it was. It certainly isn't a laugh riot, or nearly as good as the original, but I managed to get some low brow chuckles from it. I would rank it as second best in the series, personally5/10",Scary Movie 3

It worst then Scary movie 2 and that was awful. I have seen all the movies they are making fun of. Most of them are good. But they did not put down our insult those movie they just were not funny. There probably like the movies they fun of. They are probably bigger horror movie fans then I am. Even with the crappy horror movies they made fun of they did not point out of stupid they were they just did stupid collage hummer. The bad horror movies they made fun of were the better movies.

38,filipemanuelneto,Tolerable.,5,29 January 2021,"This is the third film in the ""Scary Movie"" franchise... and this time, Cindy will be the protagonist of satirical situations and parodies of notable mild horror films like ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Happening"", ""Signs"" or ""The Ring"". That is, this film repeats exactly the same formula that we already know, changing only the films that are the target of satire. It does not present anything new or that has not been rehearsed in the previous two films, and the jokes are much weaker and loaded with sexual allusions, appealing to easy laughter. The dialogues are uninteresting.The film again brings some of the actors that we already know, in the characters that we are used to. I refer specifically to Anna Faris and Regina Hal who, with their characters, are the protagonists of the film. They do a reasonable job, but not brilliant. I also liked Leslie Nielsen's effort, despite the fact that he is much more subdued and serious than usual. The film features several cameos and names known as Queen Latifah, Denise Richards, Pamela Andersen and Jenny McCarthy, but without any brightness or remarkable merit. Overall, the cast does a poor job.Technically, it is a film that invested heavily in visual and special effects, and that was an interesting and successful maneuver on the part of the production. The effects are good and have quality. It's a relatively short film, it doesn't tire the audience, and even those who didn't like it very much see the film without problems. The sets and costumes do their job, as does the soundtrack. The biggest problem with this film is, in fact, the rather poor interpretation of the cast.",Scary Movie 3
39,TheMovieDiorama,Scary Movie 3 (.5?) is one of my ultimate guilty pleasures.,5,30 April 2018,"Much like its predecessors, it's not a good film. Fortunately, it's such a massive improvement over the second instalment that there is a sense of reinvigoration for the franchise. A news reporter is sent to investigate mysterious crop circles ('Signs') where a deathly video tape ('Rings') is rapidly killing all who watch it, including a wannabe rapper ('8 Mile'). The vulgarity is kept to a minimum and instead just plain old stupidity is injected into every scene. Ranging from driving over children, Michael Jackson's plastic nose, Charlie Sheen's acting, Pamela Anderson's bouncy jugs and a rap battle that ends with a KKK reference. Obscene and offensive? Yes, but it's actually relatively funny to watch. I'm probably juxtaposing myself and being hypocritical against the previous films...but there is something about this that tickles my testicles. The scenes involving Brenda makes my life complete. ""Cindy...the TV's leaking..."" is a standout but it's Hall's delivery of the line ""now who the *insert expletive* threw that!"" that sends me into hyperdrive. I was howling. I remember rewinding that three second clip and programming it on loop, it made me laugh that much. Removing Wayans' vulgarity and replacing it with Mazin and Proft's arguably more intelligent screenplay was a smart move for the franchise. It actually felt like a cohesive plot this time! Oh, and Simon Cowell gets shot multiple times. Some would call that sweet justice. As always, some of the jokes don't land, the film references become tiresome, the '8 Mile' parody slugs along for too much of the runtime and the entire third act just lost the humorous momentum that was built up. But underneath my cold lifeless body, I feel warmth for this flick for all the wrong reasons. It's just so damn great if you allow yourself to be lost in the stupidity and ridiculousness of the parodies. I live in hope that this franchise can continue and get stronger...*cough*",Scary Movie 3
40,insomniac_rod,Cheap but entertaining. Not enough Horror spoofs.,5,3 January 2007,"This is a honest movie because it's humor is directed for a teenager audience, and the PG-13 rating just confirms it.The humor is typical for a PG-13 movie; you have less sex jokes than in the previous Scary movies, and it also spoofs popular movies among teens like ""8 Mile"", ""Signs"", and ""The Ring"".The truth is that ""Scary Movie 3"" is mindless entertainment and should only be enjoyed by people who are in the mood for goofy humor or for fans of ""The Ring"" and the fore-mentioned movies.I found it to be silly and boring at some points, but okay for cheap laughs in the American way. Charlie Sheen was surprisingly good in his role. Anna Faris always delivers expectations and looks simply stunning. The rest of the cast is just regular and do not add anything special.Well, watch this sequel if you dig teen American humor. The whole 8 mile spoof was the best in my opinion.Not enough Horror spoofs; that's the main problem. It's supposed to be a ""Scary Movie"".",Scary Movie 3
41,Anonymous_Maxine,An absolute disaster just like the first two.,1,12 November 2003,"Now, my bitter disappointment by this time in the ridiculous Scary Movie saga is no surprise, and I have no one to blame but myself for going to the theaters to see it in the first place, and the only weak excuse I have is that I heard from someone that it was much better than the first two (really, could it possibly have been WORSE??) because it had a different director. So I figured that since it wasn't TOTALLY a production of the abysmal senses of humor of the Wayans brothers, I would give it a shot, and the only good thing that came of it was that I learned once and for all how important it is to consider a film's target audience before paying real money to sit in an entire theater full of them.So, that being said, if you're the kind of person that would really get a kick out of seeing an eight-year-old boy beaten repeatedly about the head, face, and body with a baseball bat, please, go see this movie. If it would really please you to see that same boy get hit by a car TWICE, you're sure to enjoy this idiotic mess of a film. If, on the other hand, you like to have the slightest speck of actual thought put into a film, you might want to avoid this one, or at least wait until it comes out of video so you don't have to surround yourself with the kinds of people who answered yes to the first two questions. Believe me, I surrounded myself with them a couple nights ago and wished the entire time that I had a pot to put over my head and a wooden spoon to hit it with. That would have been more enjoyable than the movie.When I write my IMDb reviews, I usually try to keep from getting too upset by how bad a movie is. After all, I'm the one that went to see it in the first place, right? And I don't believe in that `I want my money back' crap. Nowhere at any movie theater in the world does it say at the ticket booth `Satisfaction Guaranteed.' When you buy a movie ticket, you spent the money whether you liked the movie or not, that's not a hard concept to figure out. I have no problem with a movie being offensive. Quite the contrary, offensive movies tend to be the ones that are most remembered because they made an impression, even if it might have been a relatively bad one. Movies that make you a little bit uncomfortable are the ones that you notice, the ones that make a lasting difference. And I'm not only talking about massively important examples like Schindler's List or American History X or anything like that.Consider this, if every single movie was happy and fun like something like Indianan Jones or Toy Story or Back to the Future, movies would be pointless, they would be little more than pretty things to look at and something to make us laugh and to entertain us for an hour and a half. But when a movie makes us uncomfortable or is offensive to our beliefs or our way of life, maybe just because it shows us something that we don't normally or have never seen and probably don't WANT to see (like death), that's when they gain a new kind of power over us - the power to affect our view of the world. Unfortunately, obtaining this kind of constructive discomfort is not only difficult to capture, it is also VERY easy to screw up, especially when you, as the director/writer/etc, of the film clearly do not care about getting it right and/or do not understand the importance of getting it right.And this is not just true of dramatic war films or deadly serious films, it's also very true of the comedy and even the spoof comedy. The spoof comedy even more than the rest is expected to make fun of the movies that it spoofs and to do it RESPECTFULLY. Granted, some of the jokes in Scary Movie 3 are funny, some of the spoofs are done in relatively good taste (although, compared to the rest of the material, that's not saying much), and some of them I laughed out loud at. But where the Scary Movies go seriously and unforgivably wrong is that they do not understand when they have gone too far, when they've crossed the line, when they've crossed from being childishly amusing to being seriously offensive. And not the good kind of offensive either.I'm not just talking about jokes that are too gross or boobs that are almost popping out or too much profanity, I'm talking about the fact that there WILL be people seeing this movie who have had a brother or a cousin or a SON who has been killed by getting hit by a careless driver, and these people will have walked into this movie having no idea that they are going to see this happen onscreen and have to suffer through an entire theater-full of morons laughing their idiot heads off. Scary Movie 2 featured a character with a disfigured arm, and everyone groaned and yelled and said `Oh God gross!!!' when he ate mashed potatoes off his hand as though he were performing fellatio on it. Clearly, Mawn and Sharlon Wayans, or whatever their names are, have no idea that there are people like this in real life, who want to be able to go to the movies and have a good time just like everyone else.So like I said, I have no problem with movies being offensive. I encourage it. But it becomes a problem when the makers of the film have no idea about how the mechanics of offensive material work, and the Wayans brothers are clearly clueless. This is not something that's `all in good fun,' this is the absolute bottom of the scale of bad taste, stuff for which there is no place in mainstream entertainment. I hope that I've avoided offending anyone who enjoyed the movie by things I've said in this review. I support constructively offensive material in movie reviews just like I do in the movies, as I described above, and I do not try to offend anyone with what I say in my reviews.So that being said, honk if you love the Scary Movies. Then drive into a tree.",Scary Movie 3

43,Captain_Couth,The worse of the trilogy. A bad idea with loads of forced fed humor.,1,19 August 2005,"Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to begin with. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. Whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots, at least it was funny. There's nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny. Hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles who'll laugh at anything. When they catered to the junior high school crowd, any sense of self respect was tossed out the window. Ring parodies are not funny. I have watched them in comedies since 1998. They're so dated. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool either. What's even worse is making fun of two broken down has been ""performers"" whose best days were NEVER.The death of American cinema has been a slow one. Films like this are the nails that are being pounded into it's coffin. Whatever happened to real humor? I haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time. Too many bad movies rot the brain. You want proof? Go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Don't believe the hype. I would rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again!Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).",Scary Movie 3

Scary 3 forgoes the Wayans factor and instead employs the Airplane! factor, as it's directed by David Zucker, part of the creative team behind Airplane!, Hot Shots!, The Naked Gun!, and other exclamatory titles. (Even Leslie Nielsen, who appeared in Airplane! and has made a career out of similar roles, turns up here as well.)So with that pedigree at work, it would be understandable if expectations were a little high for this movie. Let's check the scoreboard. Scary Movie 1: a lot of fun, did a very good job spoofing self-serious horror movies. Scary Movie 2: same crew, awful result - totally immemorable. Scary Movie 3, then, should be as good as if not better than the first movie, if only for the fine comedic chops of the director.SM3 parodies three movies, for the most part: The Ring, 8Mile, and Signs. There's also some Matrix tossed in for good measure - these movies are known for their kitchen-sink approach. From The Ring, you have the whole bit about the tape that kills those who watch it and the bit about the girl down the well; from 8Mile, you have the I-wanna-be-a-white-rapper bit, with Simon Rex perfectly pantomiming Eminem; and from Signs you have that whole aliens-are-coming-see-the-crop-circles bit. There are plenty of pop culture references, including an eerie stand-in for Michael Jackson.
The problem is that the jokes are scattershot, as if someone loaded a BB gun full of humor but removed the casing, thus causing quips and pranks to hit some targets but miss others by a long shot. Movies like this that rely on a fast pace, physical comedy, and a script full of everything the writers can lay their hands on. And because of this reliance, these movies tend to be - exactly like their jokes - hit or miss. For every Hot Shots!, there's a Top Secret!. This is because the law of averages catches up to the screenwriter - not every joke can be funny, and the more jokes are tossed around, the higher the risk that they won't be funny. This doesn't mean it's impossible to have a rapid-fire funny movie - see the aforementioned Airplane! and, for you older-film buffs, movies like His Girl Friday that lived off the rapid-fire humor.The basic plot has bright-eyed TV reporter Cindy (Anna Faris) breaking a story about mysterious crop circles on a farm outside Washington. The owner of the farm, Tom (Charlie Sheen), is a former minister whose wife died in a tragic accident. Meanwhile, people die a week after watching a particular weird videotape. Somehow, it all ties in together.Sheen seems to be making a living out of lampooning himself and anyone else, and he turns in his usual good work here. At this point in his career, you know what you're going to get from Charlie Sheen. Faris is appealing as the intrepid reporter, exuding both charm and cuteness in equal amounts - but not so much that you'll go into a diabetic shock. Besides Nielsen, among those who show up for small (or even cameo) roles include Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, Jeremy Piven, Camryn Manheim, Darrell Hammond, Simon Cowell, Denise Richards, Queen Latifah (one of the few who rose above her material), Eddie Griffin, D.L. Hughley, George Carlin, Ja Rule, and a host of rappers, including Macy Ray, Redman, Method Man, Master P, and Raekwon. With all those recognizable, you wind up with a mishmash; the actors and rappers are overwhelmed by their celebrity (except for Latifah, who is clearly slumming) and are nothing more than distractions, for the most part.But even without the myriad celebrity cameos, this is just not a winner. It's not as bad as the second Scary Movie, but it pales in comparison with the first - and it's leagues worse than most of the previous Zucker comedies. There are some funny moments (including a hilarious wake!), and some fine physical comedy, but the film mostly falls flat.",Scary Movie 3

The IMDb website lists 23 movies (horror, sci-fi and other) that receive the send up treatment so, if you see enough mainstream movies, half the fun is seeing how many references you can spot. My own list included two that weren't in the IMDb list - Dark Water and Something About Mary  but there were enough I didn't spot to make it party fun for watching again later with such friends who can share these otherwise mindless gutter offerings. Riotously politically incorrect or just dumb  depending on how low you let your taste in comedy sink.

49,MaxBorg89,Considerably better than the first two Scary Movies,8,13 November 2006,"The first Scary Movie (2000) was a misfire, despite some watchable parts. The sequel, released a year later, was one of the most forgettable films of all time. How surprising then, that this third installment shows to be the best in the franchise (the fourth movie is decent, but not as good as this one). Maybe that's because of the director, David Zucker, the king of spoofs, the guy who gave us Airplane! and Naked Gun.Whereas the Wayans brothers envisioned Scary Movie as a montage of unrelated film references added to very puerile humor, Zucker delivers an organic, solid picture, whose plot almost seamlessly combines elements from The Ring, Signs, 8 Mile and The Matrix. There are other rip-offs as well (The Others), but the story's main focus is on those four flicks, as it shamelessly keeps staging unmissable, hilarious set-pieces.Well, not always, actually. There are a few bits that aren't life-threateningly funny, mostly because it's stuff we've seen before, and done better (some of the Matrix scenes, for example). Thankfully, though, that doesn't prevent the film from being enjoyable, mainly thanks to a terrific cast, including Eminem-clone Simon Rex (very good) and Charlie Sheen mimicking Mel Gibson. And when it's a Zucker movie, could there not be Leslie Nielsen? Finally back after putting Frank Drebin to rest, the ever-reliable Nielsen steals the show in the movie's third act, playing the craziest president in US history.For once, the third episode proves to be much better than its predecessors. Those uninitiated to the Scary Movie series shouldn't waste their time: the fun really starts with number three.7,5/10",Scary Movie 3
50,kluseba,A matured and diversified movie with great actors,7,7 March 2011,"This third part of the hilarious series is in my opinion the best movie. For the first time, there are several parallel stories, essentially the ones about the alien invasion and signs in the corn fields as well as the story of a deadly video tape. This adds a certain amount of creativity and diversity to the movie while the first two parts have been quite linear and superficial. Numerous films are honoured in one way or the other in this movie from ""Signs"" and ""The ring"" to ""Eight Mile"". The jokes are much more diversified and surprising even if some of them are still quite silly and childish but one can say that the series have really matured in here and that they find their climax in here.Another positive fact is that many star actors are starring in this movie and not only more or less talented young actors. Pamela Anderson plays a stupid blond haired bitch, Charlie Sheen plays a pastor without faith and a broken family and the unique Canadian king of comedy Leslie Nielsen plays a hilarious and dumb president of the United States of America that makes me laugh in every scene he is acting, even in the very end and finally enjoyable ending of the movie that is not as dumb and all of a sudden as the ending of the other scary movies.To keep it short, this movie is really entertaining and funny and not only perfect for parties or young kids that think they are very cool that they have watched such a trendy movie but also for the cinematic lunatics that adore the more professional attitude of this movie concerning the enjoyable acting and the new and surprising diversity.",Scary Movie 3

It may have been the copy I saw, or maybe the theater didn't have the film set up right on the projector, but for some reason, I kept seeing the boom stick appear in every other scene in the movie! Was this deliberate of the filmmakers or did they really not know that the boom stick was in most of the shots? Not that it took away from the movie. This was a comedy, and it had laughs.

Here it spoofs films such as 'The Ring', 'Signs' and 'The Matrix' and from time to time I thought it was really funny.But when I think something is funny doesn't mean anything with a film like this. 'Scary Movie 3' is a matter of taste. If you like 'The Naked Gun', 'Hot Shots' and 'Scary Movie' you like this one, if you hate them, you hate this one.

55,philip_vanderveken,They're back on the right track,8,7 June 2005,"Seeing the second and the third movie in the Scary Movie series short after each other, gave me the perfect opportunity to see what the change of director can do to a movie. I liked the first movie, but didn't find the second one worth another watch, because they had lost all originality or sense of good humor. All they did was badly repeating what had worked in the first movie and that is something that should be avoided at all time. Now with David Zucker as the director, the man who also gave us some other excellent parodies like ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"", instead of Keenen Ivory Wayans, I had some good hopes again. And he certainly didn't disappoint me...Of course you'll recognize several famous movies again. This time they are making fun of ""The Ring"", ""Signs"", ""8 Mile"",... but also other aspects from showbiz will be treated. You'll find Michael Jackson and references to the sex tape with Pamela Anderson in it as well, but the main difference with ""Scary Movie 2"" is that this time it all has been written into one solid and hilarious story. And the story isn't the only thing that has been improved, so has the acting. With some famous actors like Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielsen, who both have a solid record full of humorous TV-series and / or movies, you know that you can expect the best of the best again when it comes to this kind of humor. But people like for instance Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy were an excellent surprise and did give this movie something extra. I'm not saying that they had some very difficult roles, but what they did really worked and that's all I'm asking.Overall this movie is a lot better than the previous one. Once again it is full references to other movies, but it is the humor that makes the difference. It's probably because they have chosen a new director and have taken more time to come up with a new story, that the concept works again. I'm looking forward to ""Scary Movie 4"" and give this one a solid 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.",Scary Movie 3

58,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Scary Movie 3""- David Zucker breathes new life into the troubled but mildly entertaining franchise and delivers one of the better installments.",7,11 October 2017,"Ah, the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. A strange but fascinating and mildly entertaining relic when viewed in retrospect. Originally the brainchild of the Wayans brothers comedy team, the first entry in the series debuted back in the year 2000, serving as a wild and raunchy parody of the popular horror feature ""Scream."" In addition, that first ""Scary Movie"" also set a new standard in parody, peppering in numerous small tributes, gags and nods to other famed contemporary releases of the genre, going for a counter-intuitive aim at quantity of jokes over quality. And while it was a troubled release, it was a huge hit for the studio, and was quickly followed up with a sequel in 2001, this time broadening the scope and taking aim at even more movies and genres. And by then, the formula stuck, with ""Scary Movie 2"" being arguably the best of the series.By the time the third movie rolled out in 2003 however, there were some major shake-ups behind the scenes. Most notably being that series creator Keenan Ivory Wayans and his brothers Shawn and Marlon jumped ship after disputes with the studio, leaving the series without its core creative team. With the future of the series uncertain, eventually a major change-up occurred that would breathe new life into the troubled franchise. That being that comedy mastermind David Zucker, the mind behind ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"", was hired to take control and helm the third installment, along with his frequent writing collaborator Pat Proft and newcomer Craig Mazin.And it was a move that paid-off. While it still falls prey to the same issues of incredibly forced low-brow gags and contrived situational humor that bogged down the first two entries, Zucker's zany mile-a-minute pacing and penchant for nonstop humor make ""Scary Movie 3"" one of the better films of the series, with a far better hit-to- miss laugh ratio than pretty much every other entry. The film continued the trend of the original and places its focus on a number of films that were released around the same time, with the bulk of the plot lampooing the M. Night Shyamalan hit ""Signs"" and the deliciously gritty American remake ""The Ring.""Series star Anna Faris returns as Cindy, now working as an investigative journalist while raising her troubled nephew Cody. (Drew Mikuska) When a supposedly haunted video-tape hits close to home for Cindy, she is forced on a journey to try and save the day from the malevolent and vengeful spirit responsible for its creation. Along the way, she also finds herself falling for a wannabe rapper (Simon Rex) and contending with evil aliens who threaten the lives of a simple farmer (Charlie Sheen) and his family.The biggest treat of the film is the wide cast of comedic talents. It's a lot of fun seeing Faris back in the role that arguably made her a star, and she's as charming and likable as ever. We also get Regina Hall back as Brenda from the previous films in a small guest-spot, and its just great to see her interact with Cindy in their scenes together. Charlie Sheen's a blast and a half, and he really goes all-out for the films wonderfully silly comedic tone. He's very charismatic here and definitely reminded me of his role in the similarly structured and paced ""Hot Shots!"" flicks from back in the day. We even get some surprising and very funny cameos from the likes of comedy legends Leslie Neilson and George Carlin, and both steal the show despite their limited screen time.Where the film doesn't quite work is the structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting an especially compelling script, and it's clear the movie just wants to make the audience laugh. But the movie is pretty shoddily assembled and a lot of the plot-lines and stories seem way too tenuously connected. It just doesn't have that sharp flow that worked so well in the first two entries. I also do think that a few too many jokes feel out of left field and incredibly forced, and the fact that the rating was brought down from a hard-R to a PG-13 did neuter a bit of the comedy. Sure, the anatomical gags and the adult references were starting to feel played out by the end of the second installment... but this movie could have benefited from a few more raunchy jokes and references. It just feels a bit too tame compared to what came before.On the whole though, the wickedly charming cast and nonstop jokes that director Zucker brings to the table more than make up for these issues. While it's not the best of the series and it's far from being high art, ""Scary Movie 3"" fundamentally succeeds at what it sets out to do, and it does so with some great gusto. It made me laugh. Quite often in fact. And for that, I give it a pretty good 7 out of 10.",Scary Movie 3

60,Pumpkin_Man,Definitely One of my Favorites in the Series!!!,10,16 April 2013,"Although the series took a different route after the Wayans Brothers left, Scary Movie 3 appealed to me more than SM2 did. Mostly because it spoofed 8 Mile when I was going thru my gangsta' rap phase. Another thing is that Leslie Nielsen makes an appearance as a dim-witted President. Nielsen is one of my favorite comedic actors since childhood. 10 years later, I still love this movie. It's my 2nd favorite behind the original. Anna Faris and Regina Hall return as Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks. Cindy is now a news reporter and investigates the crop circles that have appeared in farmers Tom and George Logan's cornfield. Tom is the serious brother to George. George is the wanna-be rap artist who begins to fall in love with Cindy. When Cindy finds an evil videotape, she has 7 days to live unless she can destroy Tabitha, the evil girl who possesses the tape. Filled with cameos by Anthony Anderson, Queen Latifah, Kevin Hart, Eddie Griffin, Pamela Anderson, Fat Joe, and many others, I consider this to be one of the best in the series. I highly recommend SCARY MOVIE 3!!!",Scary Movie 3
61,BrandtSponseller,Scary Movie 3!,9,11 April 2005,"Scary Movie 3 is largely a spoof of five films, The Ring (2002), Signs (2002), 8 Mile (2002) and to a lesser extent, The Matrix (1999) and The Matrix Reloaded (2003). It begins with a spoof of the first scene from The Ring, then cuts to Tom's (Charlie Sheen) discovery of the crop circles on his farm ala Signs. As a bridge between the stories, Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) is a television news reporter who is doing a story on the crop circles, and who is the guardian of a young psychic boy, Cody (Drew Mikuska), similar to Aidan of The Ring. The two stories turn out to be intimately connected. Tom's brother, George (Simon Rex) is a white rapper, ala Eminem in 8 Mile, and he strikes up a romance with Campbell. Meanwhile, President Harris (Leslie Nielsen) also becomes involved as the security of the country is threatened.I used to make it a point to not read any other reviews before I wrote my own, but recently, I've become curious when I watch a film I really enjoy, like Scary Movie 3, that many other people seemed to dislike. I find it informative to read the negative reviews to try to figure out why people dislike the film.The negative reviews for Scary Movie 3 weren't very helpful. The most popular complaints seem to be that the trailer ruined the film by ""giving away the good parts"" and that the film has fun at the expense of some people's sacred cows. Additionally, many people made a comment to the effect that you'd only enjoy the film if you're, say, 13 or under.I never watch trailers before I see a film any longer. I have also had trailers ruin many films for me in the past, so I just stopped watching them; I recommend that you do the same. If you don't know already, think about commonalities in the films you tend to like. Get an idea for the genres, directors, actors and so on that you usually enjoy. That's the only guide you really need to determine if you should see a film. It's not a guarantee, but what is? I actually look away when trailers appear on screen before the feature when I'm watching a film in the theater, and I try to mentally block out the sound. It's pretty easy to do, as trailers tend to be heavier on sound effects than dialogue. If trailers appear on television, I quickly change the channel. At any rate, it doesn't make the film you're considering any worse just because you watched a trailer first. Scary Movie 3 isn't bad because the trailer ruined it for you.Next, it's not a good idea to watch these kinds of comedies (we might call them ""absurdist comedies"", or ""outrageous comedies"") if you have any sacred cows--that is, anything that you feel one should not joke about, or that one could go too far in joking about. I don't see it as the film's fault if you haven't analyzed yourself and/or if you do not research the kinds of films you're considering viewing so that you don't expose yourself to something that you're going to consider offensive. If you're sensitive about certain things then you need to learn how to avoid them. If you're allergic to nuts or shellfish, you're going to be careful to not eat anything containing nuts or shellfish, right? It's not the chef's fault.Finally, I'm definitely older than 13--I'm in my late 30s, and I loved Scary Movie 3. I came very close to giving it a 10 out of 10--it was at that score until the climax, which I felt unfortunately lost a bit of the comic momentum that preceded it, and which arrived a bit too soon for my tastes (I prefer longer films).It helps to be familiar with the films being spoofed. Believe it or not a lot of the jokes are fairly subtle jabs at elements of the source material--for example, the pillow fight of the opening scene, which has connections to the almost lesbian subtext of the same scene in the original Japanese version of The Ring, Ringu (1998); or the character and camera ""spins"" when Tom first exits his farmhouse, which pokes fun at the stylistic cinematography of Signs. There are also many quicker references to other films. These will have far less payoff if you're not familiar with the source material. For example, during the climax of Scary Movie 3, there's not only a reference to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), but also the climax of Motel Hell (1980), which features an infamous chainsaw ""duel"".There is a stylistic difference between the first two Scary Movies and this one, which is undoubtedly correlated to the change in directors. Rather than the Wayans Brothers, David Zucker directs here. Zucker is the exclamatory wiz who also helmed Airplane! (1980), Top Secret! (1984), and The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988). Scary Movie 3 is much more in the vein of Zucker's previous work than the other Scary Movies. I can't imagine why someone would like the one style and not the other, but if so, that might help you decide which Scary Movies to see, if any.Finally, there were also some complaints over the plot of this film, especially the combination of such seemingly disparate plots from the source material. It's important to remember that this is absurdist comedy, with an emphasis on absurd. The crazy segues from one plot to the other, with them meeting in the middle thanks to Cindy, President Harris and a number of other crazy devices, was beautifully ridiculous. I want ridiculous when I watch a film like this. That's largely what attracts me to the genre. If you're at all a fan of absurdism, you should find much to enjoy here.",Scary Movie 3
62,CitizenCaine,Scarier Than The First Two In Ineptitude,2,14 January 2004,"What can be said about the third movie in a series of horror spoofs that have progressively deteriorated? As with both previous films, the previews we see over and over again give away the best moments before we see them in the theater. The opening sequence with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy is one of these moments. Conversely, there's nothing like seeing scenes in previews that are cut from the movie, like Queen Latifah's frying pan scene. I saw the movie with probably less than 20 people and there were almost no laughs in the audience through the entire movie. No matter, Scary Movie 4 is already in the works right now; because, what really matters is that this movie made over $100,000,000. This film was directed by David Zucker and not Keenen Ivory Wayans, which means there's a welcome relief from the extremely juvenile bodily fluid, fart, and sexual jokes that plagued the second film. There is one funny bit with the aliens that is an exception however. As with most of Zucker's films, the gags and jokes are rapid-fire and misfire. Most of them are misfires. The gags are very loosely strung together with bits from several recent movies, including The Ring and Signs. Some of the scenes are shockingly unfunny, like the one with the girl fight with the girl from The Ring. I kept wondering what more there was going to be to scenes like these in the movie, and then realized there wasn't anything else coming. Some of the scenes are embarrassingly labored too, like Charlie Sheen's scene with Denise Richards. The next installment is going to be focused on superhero films where I'm sure Hulk and Spider-man will be targets. Anna Faris and Regina Hall, the only two leftovers from the first two films, should have an opening sequence in Scary Movie 4 where they bludgeon all the Wayans brothers to death and then ax each other. That would take about 10 minutes of footage. Then we can watch 70 minutes of blank film and laugh at how empty the rest of the film is. 1/2 star of 4.",Scary Movie 3

The spoof won comedy fans over and has since seen spin off sequels and numerous other parody franchises such as Disaster Movie and Epic Movie.Here the third instalment of the franchise aims its attention towards Signs, The Ring and 8 Mile with some great gags and physical humour to boot, if not as strong as the original parodies in Scary Movie.The 2000 release was so popular because it basically was Scream, only with a lighter and more comic approach whereas here the parodies are all there but which never quite feel as genuine as the original movies.The 8 mile reflections for example are way over the top as Simon Rex brings an over exaggerated Eminem replica to the film. His exuberant timing and constant flaws will generate laughs but he never appears as the famous rapper which was present in the Marshal Mathers film. To be fair to Rex the scripting for his part was inconsistent as the over dramatic concepts overshadowed the comic abilities.Queen Latifha's Oracle is unbelievably annoying and flat, though her 'husband' Orpheus has a few good moments. I say a few as he is only on screen briefly.Anna Faris again brings her charm to the screen and is once more the best on screen presence. Charlie Sheen also generates a sophisticated sense of humour to spice up the dull parts. His on screen part with Denise Richards with the car crash is particular comedy gold.When it comes to replicating hits, Scary Movie 3 has numerous digs with its sweeping physical humour. Though predictable it doesn't quite take the shine off how funny it is. The inclusion of Cody and the car is among the best bits.Where The Matrix Reloaded gets a fine comedy work over, The Ring and Signs perhaps are a bit overstretched for that sheer comedy originality. But on first viewing they are quite hilarious and you will still be laughing later on.These films are designed for short term profit and to poke fun at current blockbusters and celebrities so it may tire after a few years, but this is still comedy with a sly edge",Scary Movie 3

A film that was joyous in its own stupidity, and contained more laughs than the original with its over the top antics.Scary Movie 3 isn't really a Scary Movie sequel at all though. Not only do its best jokes come from non-horror films, but it sees the underrated Wayans brothers ship out their franchise to the same people that made Naked Gun and Hot Shots.As a result what had dared to try and be different in the ""irony for the hard of thinking"" world of Hollywood spoof movies was now absorbed back into the formulaic world of self-satisfied unfunniness.Leslie Neilson - a man who stops Steve Martin winning ""smuggest, unfunniest white-haired guy of the year"" every year running, isn't actually so bad in this particular movie, but what we essentially have is a parade of tepid mugging to camera and Caucasians without a natural flair for comedy thinking that saying stuff with tongue in cheek equates humour. It doesn't.",Scary Movie 3
67,aesgaard41,Weaker Installment,8,2 January 2004,"I was estatic that David Zucker would be covering the next Scary Movie installment; I have nothing against the Wayans Brothers, but they always put too much emphasis on sex and fart jokes or any other obscene material. Zucker is more in your face with the humor, but the plot this time has so many movie references squeezed into it that it becomes harder to follow coherently. I recognized many of those scenes even without seeing the other movies. I love seeing Anna Faris again, but she is much more attractive as a brunette than as a blonde. Speaking of which, Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy are teamed up for the first time for a hilarious opener. They play sisters with a half a brain each and neither one is using their half. Pamela meanwhile jiggles through her scenes looking bigger than ever. Charlie Sheen is funnier here than when he did Hot Shots and Leslie Neilsen is here roped into this as a President of the United States more deluded than George W. Bush. Nothing is held sacred though as religous icons and the handicapped are parodied; the movie is trying to be a politically incorrect as possibl e as the satire needle jumps all over the place. The black rapper stereotype, however, is stretched thin as one guy tries to imitate Eminem. The boy playing the Sixth Sense parody goes through a lot of unnecessary abuse. The funeral scene stands out in the entire movie as Anthony Anderson fails to understand what a wake is and accidentally blow up Regina Hall while trying to resurrect her. The movie, however, ends abruptly, practically unfinished. Several of the concepts that were predicted didn't happen. Peter Boyle does not portray Frankenstein and Faris doesn't have any Harry Potter moments. I can only hope these scrapped scenes are used in the next sequel.",Scary Movie 3
68,russem31,MUCH better than Scary Movie 2,7,30 December 2005,"This Scary Movie is far superior to the sub-par Scary Movie 2. The main reason for this is that: 1. The Wayans Brothers were replaced by David Zucker (of Airplane and Naked Gun fame). Although I enjoyed the Wayans Brothers first Scary Movie film - they were too raunchy for my taste unlike David Zucker (whose gags and jokes in the aforementioned films he did were funny because of well thought-out without resorting to being overly perverted and raunchy).2. The filmmakers had time to actually come up with a stronger script (they had 2 years to do this film versus only 1 year between Scary Movie 1 and 2).3. The filmmakers decided to keep Anna Faris (Cindy Campbell) and Regina Hall (Brenda Meeks) as continuity from the first two films - they are the reason the films are funny.4. The filmmakers got Leslie Neilsen! He's a riot as the aloof President Harris.Overall, this is almost as good as the first Scary Movie film. A strong 7 out of 10.I can't wait for Scary Movie 4 to come out in 2006!",Scary Movie 3

Although, not a masterpiece, it was at least funny and entertaining and the second, while lacking the same depth as the first, was also funny in it's own reputation. This one isn't in the same depth made in the first, but it's not as bad as some say it is, in my opinion.The script had some funny moments, but lacks the wit and charm of the first two films. The story is largely thin and predictable for it's own good and the pacing is uneven with the beginning rushed and gets a little too slow.The cast is the one of the few redeeming qualities. Anna Faris gives out her best performance and is done vastly better than the previous two. The rest of the actors, including Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, and Queen Latifah gave some great performances so far. The production values is well-done and looks realistic. The spoofs are so funny with the 8 Miles, Signs, and The Ring being my favorites and the soundtrack in the movie is also pretty darn good.Overall, not as great as the first two, but I really liked it.",Scary Movie 3

Equal to the equally crappy part two, but in a more straightforward slapstick tone, as usual the jokes are rarely a full on hit, but ultimately justify the few rare hilarious moments, in the lackluster combo plot of The Ring & Signs. Even as Zucker tries to transition smoothly from the Waynes popular dominance featuring his 8 mile homage, sadly this time whitey does not win for comedy. Somehow the franchise went from one decent opener to settling into a complete cash cow intent on sheer mediocrity, a bleedin shame since the world could use some first class slapstick right now, not a pale ghost of the former glory days where one gag is parlayed for several generations across several body parts.",Scary Movie 3

It's fresher, funnier and the movies it makes fun of actually were movies that I saw and had a certain feeling about (whether I liked them or not). It's main goals are Signs (which I loved) and Ringu (which was pretty good as well). But numerous other movies are mentioned (to name a few: 8 Mile, The Sixth Sense).While it starts out like a blast, the movie loses a lot of it's touch in the second half, coincidentally (?) when Leslie Nielsen makes his appearance.

Anna Faris, the main lead lady, acts terrible and doesn't really know what the word ' acting' is. Pam and Jenn, who have a short role in the film, play it so badly that even a puke bag besides you won't help. The two main actors are somewhat better and funnier, but still their acting is garbage. The two children in the movie are expressionless and can be still deemed as extras who were just picked up to do the role.2) Loud jokes: Many of the jokes are loud and are graphically shown or are just actions like falling down from somewhere. THe number of witty lines are less.3) Oddest storyline: Taking the aid of four to five spoofs, the directors and the writers have created one of the oddest stories ever which is terribly childish and immature.4) Unnecessary: Some of the scenes of vulgarity and some nudity were just added without any reason just as an attraction for the audience, at least some of the audience.But even though this movie has all these characteristics that normally would be evaluated to form a flop movie, Scary movie 3 still makes you laugh at the loud jokes, some of them which are really hilarious. 6 out of 10.",Scary Movie 3

75,movieguy1021,Scary Movie 3: 7/10,7,24 October 2003,"A funny thing happened on the way to the movie theater tonight. The third installment of the Scary Movie series is not only PG-13, but is directed by comedy legend/genius David Zucker. Although he took over a series from the Wayans Brothers, Zucker turned it around into something almost completely new. It isn't quite in the same vein as his one true classic, Airplane!, but it shows how he should stay away from movies like My Boss's Daughter and go back into the spoof genre which got him, and his team, off the ground.The first movie based its main parodies around Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and the second was mainly revolved around The Haunting. Scary Movie 3 has two central spoofs: The Ring and Signs. The protagonist from the first two, Cindy (Anna Faris), is now an anchorwoman who investigates a mysterious videotape while odd crop circles appear. Many celebrities have cameos in parodies of recent movies.Instead of extremely crude sexual humor, Zucker knew that you don't need lewdness to make people laugh. One of the reasons why Airplane! was so great is because it was only rated PG; almost all of the humor was situational and not just shock value. Sure, Scary Movie 3 had its share of crude humor, but it wasn't as over-the-top and unnecessary as the other two's were. Instead, what he did was take his parodies and make them seem possible. For example, George Carlin plays The Architect (a parody of The Matrix Reloaded) who spends all of his time alone in a giant room. He gets so lonely, he `bonds' with his chair, what most people would do.Also, what made Scary Movie 3 funny is how it pointed out the faults of the movies that it is spoofing. Throughout Signs, Mel Gibson doesn't even mention farming once, although he lives out on a farm. Charlie Sheen, who mocks the Gibson character, continuously talks about it for the first few minutes he's on screen. In 8 Mile, one of the things I hated about it was how everyone was speaking with huge words; here, parodies of those characters do exactly this.Scary Movie 3 did have some gags that didn't work, especially around the middle of the film. It seems that Zucker just wanted to move as quickly as possible and instead of making it even 90 minutes (it's about 75) he just wanted to make a quick, short parody film. Although Carlin's character was okay, Eddie Griffin and Queen Latifah's characters (as characters from The Matrix) weren't utilized as much as they should have been. Also, Leslie Nielsen, who has been in most of the Zucker spoofs, has a small role as the President and plays a typical Nielsen character. I would have liked to have seen more of him, but at least he was able to deliver a classic Airplane! line.Scary Movie 3 is one of the funniest movies of the year, with its almost continuous laughter. It's probably the best one out of the three in the series.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for pervasive crude and sexual humor, language, comic violence and drug references.",Scary Movie 3

This time Cindy, a news reporter have to face with the killer videotape (The Ring), Alien Invading and Its Crop Circle (Sighs), A stupid white rapper (8 Miles), and prophecy of The One (The Matrix) also little from Michael Jackson (The Others).To me, this is the best of the three, with a decent storyline and making fun of. Some of the stuff is damn funny too, and it doesn't have to be semen exploding. Overall it provides much more than the first two with a good and intelligence joke.

It may just seem that I need dirty humour and such, but it isn't. This was just not that funny. It may have been because of the movies they spoofed. They just didn't do a very good job. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are good as always. But I didn't feel that the rest of the cast were that good. There is a few things they don't seem to get though, MJ jokes are old news. Get over them, just NOT funny. And all this being kicked in the crotch humour is juvenile and pathetic.

80,Antagonisten,Decent entertainment,5,18 February 2005,"In the third installment of the Scary Movie-series the directors-chair is turned over to comedy-veteran David Zucker. Something that feels sensible considering how lousy the second movie truly was.Here the target of the spoofs are mostly Shyamalans ""Signs"" and the American version of ""The Ring"", but also other movies like ""The Matrix"" get their share. What becomes apparent right from the start is how much better the comedy works here than in Scary Movie 2. It's still no amazing comedy or masterpiece. But it's not a complete failure like the second movie. It seems David Zucker has a stronger feeling for what works on screen. Also the actors help. Charlie Sheen still has that special comic timing that made the Hot Shots-movies so good, and Simon Rex is pretty funny too. Especially in his ""8 Mile""-scenes.In short you should probably not watch this is if you feel that serious cinema or pretentious comedy is your calling. But if you enjoyed movies like ""The Naked Gun"", ""Hot Shots"" and other similar outings it's quite possible that you will find this at least decent entertainment. I rate it 5/10.",Scary Movie 3

There are some signs the franchise may be on the decline, by casting actors like Leslie Nielsen of ""Airplane!"" and Charlie Sheen of ""Hot Shots!"", who seem to have a new niche in spoofs.

It was all rather cliché and slapstick, but at the same time it was well done, fast paced, irreverent, sort of fun, and quite unpredictable. Appearing in the film are a number of good comedians and off-the-wall personalities. I enjoyed Scary Movie 1, way back when, and it was interesting to catch up with the series.

It involves a random plot to do with aliens coming to earth and the cursed videotape from The Ring with some random Matrix and 8 Mile related stuff thrown in. This one improves considerably on the second, and is to be honest my favourite of the series so far. It's certainly not great. Leslie Nielsen, though he's excellent as always, isn't in it enough while the jokes are somewhat hit and miss. In fairness, quite a few of them do (There's a certain scene in the middle which I don't want to spoil since it's that good which had me in utter hysterics) but others are too obvious, overstretched, inept or occasionally just a bit offensive. The movie is a mess (How did this cost $48 million?!) but perhaps that adds to its silly charm. It's pretty funny much of the time, even if it isn't particularly good in terms of plot or intelligence. However, as a collection of gags it delivers. Uneven, certainly, and endlessly juvenile, but not as insufferable as the second one and not as endlessly vulgar as the actually alright original movie.6/10",Scary Movie 3

With help from Aunt Shaneequa, Cindy suspects that the aliens may be linked with the killer tape and must now work out both mysteries before it's the end of the world.They took a big risk when assigning the third instalment of the 'Scary Movie' series to David Zucker. It was obviously that fans of the filthy humour given by the Wayans will not be 100% pleased, but i feel that there is actually an improvement in the film than the previous two. The only two stars from the previous two films appearing in the second sequel was Anna Faris (Cindy Campbell) and Regina Hall (Brenda Meeks). Although the characters of them both have slightly changed, it's still a treat to have them in the film. Joining them is a whole host of stars including Queen Latifah, Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielsen. All of them are a pleasure to see and they all look to be enjoying themselves. The story is very flexible just like the other spoof films, but has an outline which you can easily follow. I feel the jokes are a lot better. The previous two films really seems to rely on sex and filth jokes. The jokes in this film seem better constructed and are a lot more smarter.

89,christian123,A Disappointing Sequel but Still Mildly Enjoyable,5,11 July 2005,"Scary Movie 3 isn't as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments. It all begins when roving reporter Cindy Campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps. She soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globe-threatening developments including alien invaders, killer videotapes, freaky crop circles and much more. Faced with conspiracies of massive proportions, and a crew of very strange people following her around, Cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again. The plot is a non-issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less. This time around they focus on Signs, The Ring, Matrix Reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones. The first one was {imo} one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The second one wasn't as good but still quite funny. The third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special. Let's just say that I didn't mind seeing it once but I probably wouldn't want to see it again. The jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve Charlie Sheen. The lame ones usually involve Anthony Anderson as he is very overrated. Why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny. Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated. Simon Rex shows some potential as he actually wasn't so bad. Regina Hall also returns as Brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos. Their in the opening sequence spoofing The Ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film. Denise Richards, Queen Latifah, Camryn Manheim and many others also have cameos. David Zucker directs and while this isn't another Airplane, it's also not another My Boss's Daughter either. Its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not. Like I said before if you do like it, you probably won't really like it that much. In the end, I found it a bit disappointing as the PG-13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed. Rating 6.3/10",Scary Movie 3
90,theshadow908,Now THIS is a comedy,8,17 April 2006,"Of course I liked the first two Scary Movies. They were hilarious. However, they were all just visual gags and disgusting toilet humour. In my opinion, it was a genius move having David Zucker take over for the Wayans Brothers because he's got a different style of humour...A style of humour that I find FAR funnier. Slapstick and word gags. David Zucker was responsible for the film Airplane! which is one of the greatest film comedies of all time, so I think it's great that he put his style into the Scary Movie franchise.The star power this time around is awesome. We've still got Cindy and Brenda, but now there's appearances by old comedy pros such as Leslie Nielsen and George Carlin. Even Charlie Sheen did a good job in this movie, even though he's not the best actor in the world. This Scary Movie is a spoof on Signs and The Ring, and the way they connect the two movies is genius.There's nothing much else I can say except the style of humour in this Scary Movie is SO much better than the first 2 and it's really refreshing to have a parody genius like Zucker take over for the over indulgent Wayans Brothers.

This film relies heavily on you having seen The Ring, The Matrix, Signs, and 8mile to name a few. The target audience is definitely a crowd that can handle gross-out humor and some boobs.

I loved how it made fun of the popular cliches of every black person living Ghetto-lifestyles and owning guns.  After watching ""Bringing Down the House"" these jokes were a relief.Also, the spoofs of ""Signs"" and ""The Matrix"" are also quite hilarious.  They offer lines like ""They mastered space travel and they don't know hoe to open a simple wooden door?"" by Sheen's farmer and ""I've been in this room for a long time with no one but myself and this chair; I call her...Linda"" by a goofy Architect-like character from The Matrix Reloaded.So, if you're not too stuck up about film and you want to see a good funny movie, watch this, 7.5/10.",Scary Movie 3
94,mOVIemAN56,Doesn't Quite Have It But There Are Still Some Pretty Funny Scenes,5,7 June 2005,"The Scary Movies are still a bit of classic's in my book but they should have stopped after two. Scary Movie 3 just didn't seem to have the same freshness and fun that the first two did. The film is a spoof of recent horror films such as Signs (2002), The Ring (2002) and for some odd reason The Matrix trilogy. They should have stuck to the original, no name cast instead of working in Charlie Sheen, Pamela Anderson, and Denise Richards. Pretty much they're trying to connect an odd video tape that kills people with an alien invasion. Simon Rex's character George is completely idiotic and stupid. He has no funny lines and is just plain moronic. He reminded me of Kelso from that 70's Show but just dumber. Charlie Sheen isn't exactly your top comedy actor but he does have a few good scenes especially the flashback spoof of Signs. You'll have some good laughs, some scenes are a bit dry and others just stupid. It doesn't compare to the first two but comes close. The language is cut down and the sexuality is minor. The spoofs aren't bad but some are over-used and Rex's performance mar every scene.Scary Movie 3.

95,SonicStuart,Funny as well as Scary Movie 1 and 2!,8,19 July 2004,"Genre: Horror/Comedy/MysteryRated PG-13 for Pervasive Crude and Sexual Humor, Language, Comic Violence and Drug ReferencesStar Rating: **** out of 5In this third installment of the Scary Movie franchise, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is now out of college and is now a TV news anchorwoman. Strange things begin to occur when crop circles appear on Tom Logan's (Charlie Sheen) farm, but the suspense climaxes when Cindy's best friend Brenda (Regina Hall) dies an eerie death somehow relating to a killer video tape. After her nephew Cody watches the video tape, Cindy fears the lives of all and takes matters into her own hands, summoning the help of the Oracle (Queen Latifah) and Orpheus (Eddie Griffin) and visiting a infatuated Architect (George Carlin) on Curlesco Island. From this point on, Cindy uncovers the eerie link between the crop circles and the killer video tape, and must eventually assist the President of the United States (Leslie Nielsen) in a preventing alien invasion. My favorite parts were when in the beginning were they were spoofing The Ring and I think Lord of the Rings and Signs. I also liked the part were George (Simon Rex) and Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) were at Brenda's funeral and they might of over-heard saying that Brenda was alive and so then they do all of these things to try and bring her back and it doesn't work. I also liked a lot of the other funny parts. It was a major shame that Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans weren't in this third installment of the Scary Movie franchise because at that time they were busy with another movie. But they were the writing credits for this movie.BOTTOM LINE: I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!",Scary Movie 3
96,jayjaycee,Hits your laughing muscles like a paint bucket,5,28 January 2020,"""Scary Movie 3"" is a horror comedy directed by David Zucker starring Anna Farris and Charlie Sheen. Without a doubt, every single cinephile out there has this one specific film that's their all time favourite guilty pleasure. From ""Pootie Tang"" to ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" to almost any Adam Sandler feature there's at least one fan for every movie in the industry who loves it for how absolutely terrible it is. May it be the link to childhood memories or just the irresistible fascination for stupidity at times that leads us to this certain insanity, in every case they do exist. In my case, it's this absolutely trashy masterpiece (sarcasm!). I think I was around 13 years old when I watched it with my brother for the first time and although it's so bad, it became one of my favourites, to be honest. Even as of today, I'm laughing nonstop about the ridiculousness and inanity of the jokes. I think that's probably what makes it so charming. In an unimaginably silly way it parodies actually decent films I cherish, such as ""8 Mile"" and ""Signs"" and combines it with ""The Ring"" and it couldn't be any more dumb - still I love it. To this day, I'm still cracking up about the scene when he throws the bucket out of the car window and hits the biker or when Sheen wakes up and hits his head at the lamp (twice!). It's just the child in me that's extremely amused by it. It's overstated, at times way too loud and clearly foolish, but it still offers a great aspect: Leslie Freaking Nielsen as Mr. President. The man's pure comedy gold and he definitely delivers the greatest performance of the whole film, hands down. All in all, this movie is undoubtedly terrible and cheesy. The fact that it's my guilty pleasure doesn't change the obvious truth about it. It's so unimaginably bad that I love it and that's the only reason I own it on Blu-ray - otherwise I would have dumped it. But it's films like these that remind us that fun doesn't always have to result from high quality. Some films need to be watched by the child in us, so turn of your brain sometimes and embrace the embarrassment of cinematic disasters!",Scary Movie 3

98,Cedric_Catsuits,Brilliant,10,20 May 2006,"Anna Faris, Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, and so it goes on ... the list is long and impressive. There are a feast of quality comic actors, producing a genuinely funny movie. Given the talent on show it would be surprising if it wasn't funny, and unlike a lot of movie series Scary keeps on delivering the goods.The resemblance to Zucker's previous spoofs is obvious, and although I was very happy with Wayans' direction for 1 & 2 this isn't too different in style to be disappointing, and many may prefer the Airplane- & Naked Gun-style comedy. Sheen is a genius actor - much under-rated - and Anderson is always value for money - if a little stifled here. Cindy's prevalence towards open-mouthed astonishment does start to wear a little thin after 3 movies, but Anna is such a beautiful, talented and funny girl that I just don't care! I guess you either love or hate these movies, but for me there's never been a funnier series and I look forward to plenty more. Oh and did I mention, I love you Anna!",Scary Movie 3

This time the spoof is mainly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some weird reason. In my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb. If your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you.

This film follows the same main character Cindy who is now a news reporter and basically,we just see her point of view from when she finds out the world is going to be taken over by aliens,being targeted by a evil video tape that will kill you in seven days and other (not so funny) stuff. This film is what made all of them horrible spoof films like Epic Movie,Date Movie and Superfast. This movie was very disappointing but over all it was still hilarious. Some jokes were funny some were absolutely terrible and i was expecting more from who actually made spoof David Zucker who made Airplane and The Naked Gun. Scary Movie 3 is actually an awful movie but overall it was pretty funny so I can't say it's too bad.",Scary Movie 3
101,ScottDMenzel,Finally Someone Got the Scary Movie Franchise to work,7,25 October 2003,"Let me first start out by saying I think Scary Movie 1 & 2 are some of the worst movies I have ever seen. Now let me get to the good news Scary Movie 3 isn't as bad as the first 2. To be honest, Scary Movie 3 with a few scenes cut out could have possibly been one of the best spoofs to hit the cinema in years; however the editing doesn't happen.I for one was glad when the Wayans Brothers were off this project. I liked their work on In Living Color but they literally destroyed Scary Movie. The first movie had such a promising premise but they totally screwed it up. The second one was no different. The third one however has the spoof master David Zucker on board. David Zucker is responsible for some of my favorite comedies including Airplane, The Naked Gun Series, & BASEketball. This movie is no way as good as any of those movies but it tries really hard to be funny. The movie's whole ring & signs spoof was rather amusing and I did enjoy it. Some of the jokes in this film finally made me laugh because they went back to the normal spoof formula. However the spoof which I feel was way overused was the 8 mile spoof. First off this is a horror movie spoof so that shouldn't even be in the movie but its ok if it was in it for 5 minutes or so but the 8 mile part of the film took up a good 20 minutes or so of the film. This in my opinion made the movie seem to drag. I seen this movie with a theater packed full of people and it seemed that no one understood or laughed at the 8 mile portion of the film The movie had a decent cast including the funny Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris, & several others. Also a great performance by Leslie Nielsen who still has what it takes to make funny movies. David Zucker uses a lot of jokes from my favorite comedies which are mentioned above. There is a classic Airplane line which is used at the end of the movie. Well all in all for David Zucker's first attempt at Scary Movie he did a decent job recovering from what the Wayans Brothers did to the franchise. In this rare case, I feel that the scary movie series will keep getting better over time as long as David Zucker stays on as director, however if he leaves as a director then this franchise should be put to a end. All in all Scary Movie 3 is a huge improvement over the first 2 and has a lot of jokes that work but still lacks something that would make this be a great spoof. I applaud David Zucker for coming on this film and trying to bring back spoof movies. My final rating for Scary Movie 3 is a 6/10.",Scary Movie 3
102,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Scary Movie 3 (2003),5,13 March 2008,"The third Scary movie in the series. It is also my third favorite. It goes Scary movie 4, Scary movie, Scary movie 3 then Scary movie 2. It was incredibly stupid but i couldn't help but laugh.Our favorites are back Cindy and Brenda along with a few new characters. The king of spoof movies is still going on strong unlike the spoof movies that you should miss Date movie, Epic movie and Meet the Spartans. This time around they are spoofing The Ring, Signs, 8 mile and The Matrix.The humor is mixed. Sometimes it is hilarious with its unpredictable moments and then it is painful with its terrible jokes that don't even raise a laugh.This is not as rude as the first two Scary movies. This might have something to do with the Wayans brothers missing. They have been replaced by David Zucker. I enjoyed his job in BASEketball and he does another good job in this.I recommend this if you have seen Scary movie 1 & 2. It holds its position as the king of spoof movies. So if you are looking for a good spoof movie go see it. I will be seeing Scary movie 5 when it is released.5/10",Scary Movie 3
103,iwatcheverything,Rolling in the Aisles,8,24 October 2003,This movie was great.  It was exactly what a spoof movie should be.  Thanks to Zucker for bringing this type of film back.  I could not stop laughing at the jokes.  There were some great appearances by some and most everybody did their part well.  I have a weird feeling we did not get to see the whole movie and I am in hopes of a directors cut when it goes to DVD.SPOILER:The best line is Leslie Neilson using his from the Airplane movies.  Opening the door at the end and saying We're all counting on you.  That was a priceless piece of comedy right there.This will be a definite buy to finish my scary movie collection.  Did I mention that I did miss the Wayans Brothers a little?  They do some good work also.,Scary Movie 3
104,ilovedolby,I found myself laughing uncontrollably!,7,15 November 2003,"`Scary Movie 3' is an upgrade from the previous garbage that the Wayans Brothers brought us. Thankfully, we do not have to deal with their form of grotesque scenes, ridiculous marijuana jokes, or flagrant vulgarity. David Zucker has taken the reins as part writer and director. The director of such comedies as `Airplane,' and `The Naked Gun' brings with him an old school style at handling slapstick humor with jokes not based on grossing the audience out, but rather on simple high jinks. Although it becomes relentless at times, the film is ultimately far better than its predecessors. 	`Scary Movie 3' follows the story of Cindy (Anna Faris), now living in Washington DC, as she is taking care of her nephew Cody after the death of his parents.  Meanwhile, on a farm twenty miles away, a man named Tom (Charlie Sheen) wakes up to his daughter's scream and realizes that he has a crop circle that reads, `attack here.' Tom's brother George (Simon Rex), however, can not deal with the issue at hand, choosing only to focus on his rap career. He goes to Washington to perform in a rap battle where he quickly gets thrown out. Along the way he meets Cindy and the two become interested in each other, especially since Cindy is looking for a father to help her take care of Cody. But the two have bigger things to worry about-a potential alien invasion of earth. 	Like the previous `Scary Movie' flicks, this one focuses on spoofing horror films like `The Ring,' `Signs' and `The Others.' It also chooses to spoof recent blockbusters like `8 Mile' and `The Matrix Reloaded.' Here in lies the problem. It makes sense to try to spoof a horror flick, as there are so many these days. Yet trying to spoof several films is too much to handle and the plot suffers from not knowing where to go-an evident problem in films like `Spy Hard,' and `Wrongfully Accused.' In `Scary Movie 3,' the scene that relates to `8 Mile' is not necessary and it becomes tired before the main punch lines are uttered. 	To spoof a particular genre of films, focus on one and run with it. This is why films like `Hot Shots!' and it's sequel `Hot Shots: Part Deux' worked. They focused on the stories of `Top Gun' and `Rambo,' respectively. The same is true for the `Airplane' films as they focused on spoofing airline disaster flicks of the 70s. 	Is `Scary Movie 3' funny? Yes. I found myself laughing uncontrollably at times. This can be attributed to Leslie Nielsen's appearance as the President of the United States. Nielsen is a comic genius! His countenance comes off as serious, but his actions are totally silly. In one scene, he opens a door and knocks an alien down a well when Cindy and George were about to attack it. Without realizing his own dumb luck, he simply states in his classic line from `Airplane,' `I just want to tell you both good luck. We are all counting on you.' My initial response was to applaud. As far as movies go, it is the equivalent of sending Neil Armstrong into space a second time. 	We find a fair off-the-wall comedy in `Scary Movie 3.' At least parents do not have to worry about their kids sneaking into an R-rated feature anymore. `Scary Movie 3' is rated PG-13, the way its predecessors should have been designed for. Why target teenagers if you are going to make an R-rated feature? **1/2",Scary Movie 3
105,Ronin47,What a piece of crap (1/2*),1,24 October 2003,"Wow.You know, the first ""Scary Movie"" was a decent enough movie. It wasn't anything special, but it was alright. ""Scary Movie 2"" basically sucked, but it had its moments. Now here's ""Scary Movie 3"". It sure had a funny trailer. Of course, everybody knows these kinds of movies always put the best stuff in the trailer, but it's still probably gonna be kinda funny, right?Let me just say that ""Scary Movie 3"" makes the first two look like ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather II"". This movie is so bad I wanted to get up and punch the screen.Let me save you the money and demonstrate what it does for 90 minutes of audience torture: ""Hey! This part's like 'The Ring'! This part's like 'Signs'! This part's like '8 Mile'! This part's like 'The Matrix'!"" That's it. We recognize parts of those other movies, but the writers apparently thought that was enough, because they do NOTHING with them.Oh wait, this is what it's ACTUALLY like: ""Hey! This part's like 'Signs'! Except someone gets kicked in the crotch!"". Sigh.Here's the (only) good stuff: the opening scene, with Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson. There's about 3 good laughs in it. Then there's a throwaway gag about pop-up ads later on (that's actually the funniest part, but it's only about 3 seconds long).The only genuine redeeming quality, though, as in all 3 of the ""Scary Movie"" films, is Anna Faris. She's a gifted and charming actress, and I'm glad she's popping up in some quality films, like ""May"" and ""Lost In Translation"". Hopefully she'll still have a career long after ""Scary Movie 3"" is gathering dust in the dollar bin at the video store.",Scary Movie 3
106,Torgo_Approves,"In ten years time, the only Scary Movie I will gladly watch again will be this one.",7,30 July 2007,"As far as these not-so-groundbreaking comedies go, the third part is easily the one most shock-full of funny stupidity and the one that stands up to repeated viewings. It is the most quotable of the four and the one with the best story and characters, like that's saying much. But the bottom line is that the film is hilarious. It never lags behind and it always has another dumb joke, sight gag, reference or annoying kid being hit by a car up its sleeve. Unlike the first movie, where only the few scattered moments of cleverness were really funny, or the second which was stupid and lamely written like the writers' crystal meth intake depended on it, ""3"" has an abundance of dumb jokes - and almost all of them work! This can all be attributed to David Zucker, who does anything but live up to his name and shows really great comic timing. Without this, the entire script would be excruciating, but Zucker's clever direction (how many noticed Cindy jumping at the loud noise from a boat - coming from a different scene?) and the cast's talent make the film much funnier than it has any right to be. Call it a guilty pleasure or comedy gold, either way, unless you're one of those people who watches Richard Gere movies on purpose, this movie will leave you breathless with laughter. The movie has enough celebrity cameos to fill your average episode of ""The Simpsons"", a cast ranging from photogenic eye candy in the form of Pamela Anderson and Jenna McCarthy to in-need-of-a-hit actors like Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen and Anna Faris, and even a little rap music to boot (and to please the 11-year old, 50 Cent-loving, white suburban kids). The film is not ugly to look at, and the various different visual styles and moods of the movies spoofed are well re-created, like the gritty, washed-out photography of the ""8 Mile"" sequences or the oh-so-ominous music in the ""Ring"" segments. The cast works well together; few people can keep a straight face muttering ridiculous dialogue like Charlie Sheen and who can play a dumb blond better than Anna Faris? Vertically challenged, leg-humping Kevin Hart steals the show, although ""the dogs are acting strange"" is classic.Of course this kind of comedy is anything but timeless, since most of the movies spoofed will be forgotten as time goes by, but we teenagers who were born in the late eighties to early nineties will forever hold this quadrilogy of stupidity dear to our hearts. Definitely more entertaining than its victims - the ridiculously pretentious ""Ring"" (2002), the lackluster mess ""Matrix Reloaded"" (2003), or even ""8 Mile"" (2002) (which I actually liked) - ""Scary Movie 3"" is one of my favourite comedies and, in my humble opinion, one of the funniest spoofs ever made. Laugh all you want. I am.",Scary Movie 3
107,jrfranklin01,Ran out of Gas on 3,3,16 May 2004,"With the first two movies of the Scary Movies series so funny and enjoyable, I was left miffed and disappointed at the third installment.  First, it centers around two movies in particular, Signs and The Ring.  If you haven't seen either of these, then make sure you watch them first.  You won't be disappointed either as these are both good movies and much better than Scary Movie 3 anyway.  Second, expect to see a dip in the ""creative genius"" of the Wayans brothers as the movie isn't a satire for as many other movies as the prequels were.  Maybe you can blame it on a deprivation in source material as of late, but I don't think so.  The ending is...well...lame.  And as such leaves you walking away with the feeling the rest of the movie was shoddy. But not to be too critical, I did heartily laugh at several skits and appreciated the humor involved.

I thought the Scary Movie franchise always prided it self on how far they could push an R rating. And here's one pushing a PG-13.  The film isn't really bad. Anna Faris is good as usual(but not as good) the material is scarce and uninvolving.  Simon Rex is gorgeous and a little funny. Charlie Sheen is hokie, the cameos are mostly unfunny(Eddie Griffin,Macy Gray, Denise Richards) and Leslie Nielsen is just ok.  Much like the film. There is a standout scene between Pamela Anderson and Jenny Mccarthy at the beginning that garners some well desrved chuckles.  But the films lacks the subtext to really spoof the films their making fun of. Instead we get a retread of those tired jokes an incompetent audience member makes while watching the original films.

And usually, the third in the franchise is where it starts to dip in quality. It turns out this was an improvement over 2001's train wreck, but a lot of things are. Jokes are limited because of a more teen-oriented rating, characters are missing, and less boundaries are pushed. That's a fancy way of saying this can't be good. And it isn't. However, I do give the director some props. With what was handed to him, he put forth the best intentions. But no matter the effort, when your film sucks, it sucks. First of all, what went right? The leads that did return still gave great performances and still retained the charm they had in the preceding films. It's always good to see those familiar faces again. Not to mention, the film is eccentric and is always packed with energy. Let's just say, you won't be bored. And also, the jokes weren't too bad. There were some that worked.Now, what went wrong? Pretty much everything else. I felt that since that over-the-top gross out factor was absent, the slapstick element became the norm. A tip for filmmakers: Never resort to slapstick. It's not funny, and only serves as a distraction. Not to mention, the fans are torn because the original cast isn't back. What made the original powerful was all of the performers. When some of them are missing, the film just isn't the same. With a title like Scary Movie 3, your expectations certainly aren't going anywhere, and if they are, they better not be high.

112,dirtychild,Scary because it is so unfunny...,2,22 January 2005,"Scary Movie 3 doesn't really have any relation to any of the other Scary Movie movies (except for two characters by same name only). There is some sort of plot trying to spoof both The Ring (the American version) and Signs, with a little bit of 8-Mile. After seeing the shorts of this - it looked like a bit of a return to form for the scary movies BUT when you watch it and realise that the funniest jokes (or should that be joke - singular?) were (or was) on the trailer!Apparently - the Wayans brothers who were responsible for the first two - were nowhere to be seen in this instalment and I think it shows. Gone is the crude sexual humour - replaced with a pretty tame and lame sort of spoof ""Hots Shots"" humour (slap stick, Naked Gun-esquire boob jokes, Leslie Neilson)...I think that the Ring was an OK choice for doing a spoof movie - although I don't think there is enough material to sustain a full length spoof movie (maybe a 2min sketch would suffice!). Also - Signs was a very weird choice for a spoof - the original movie (in my opinion) wasn't all that memorable - so why a spoof a few years later? The 8 Mile spoof was incredibly tedious!My opinion - do not go and see this film! It is terrible - even worse than Scary Movie 2 (which seems like high art compared to Scary Movie 3).

115,ray-280,Addition By Subtraction,10,16 August 2005,"Put the name ""Wayans"" on it and I walk out of the theater (if ambushed), or change the channel. The Wayans are a brand name in Hollywood that can greenlight anything they want, but the traffic laws should be rewritten to prevent this. Fortunately, none of the Ws returned for this film.I did not see either of the first two films of this trilogy, but you really don't need to know the story to enjoy this film, since the plot of any good parody is just an excuse to deliver the maximum number of spoofs, gags, swipes, and one-liners by the end of the film. In that regard, this film does not disappoint.Anna Faris (Cindy Campbell) is a surprisingly strong and exceptionally hot leading lady who should be considered for any A-list roles in the future. She did everything asked of her and then some, and the sky appears to be the limit for her talent. Cindy is a reporter for a Newscast that brings to life the song ""Dirty Laundry"" by Don Henley (she's the bubbleheaded bleached blond who comes on at 5:00 and tells you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye). Charlie Sheen plays a former reverend who lost faith after his hot wife was killed in an accident (again, they even made that funny).Anthony Anderson is excellent in his supporting role, while the rest of the cast could have been chosen by lottery, other than Leslie Neilsen, who seems to have a contract somewhere that says a parody can't be made without him (he plays the president in this one). George Carlin makes a creepy cameo, as does Eddie Griffin and Queen Latifah, but the stars of the movie are the jokes, and they come rapid-fire.The film was designed for an intelligent audience in tune with pop culture, and doesn't take time to explain itself: Simon Cowell gets to judge an 8-mile style rap battle with predictable and hilarious results; Anderson's character sheds more light on the possible depths of the relationship between B. Rabbit and Future; Leslie Neilsen gets to deliver a classic line from ""Airplane"" at one point, while showing that he's kept up with the times in another. The newsroom was more realistic than most would admit or want to believe, and the way the horror was delivered in this film (yes, it's a genuine horror movie) was a ""Scream."" We even get a nod to Final Destination (one of the most original concepts of all time), and at times the movie even seems to parody itself.If you liked ""Airplane!"" and its genre, there's little chance you won't like this film. If you can't stand that type of humor, get ready to tear your hair out. For better or worse, this film belongs in a time capsule to explain what a movie parody is and how it should be made.",Scary Movie 3

Havings seen both ""Signs"" and ""The Ring"", it was helpful to have some knowledge of those films which were being mocked. Those who have seen neither film might get lost but it shouldn't matter too much.Two things that amazed me about this film were1. The ridiculous stereotypes of the black people in the movie. I guess the Wayans think it's O.K. to make Amos and Andy since they are black.
2. The callousness towards violence against children.Some gags in the film were either carried on longer than a bad SNL skit or simply passed over too quickly. Anyhoo, it's worth going if you don't take it seriously and have fun with the premise.",Scary Movie 3

I can't wait for Scary Movie 4(for every1 who doesn't know about SM4, it spoofs superhero movies!!)Loved It: 8.372/10(don't ask)PG-13: sexual humor, very comic violence, and language.",Scary Movie 3
120,MovieLuvaMatt,Left no impression on me,5,31 October 2003,"When I first heard that David Zucker was directing this movie, I was ecstatic.  This is the guy who brought us ""Airplane,"" the ""Naked Gun"" movies and even ""Ruthless People""--which I consider to be one of the funniest comedies of all time.  Did it live up to my expectations?  Not quite.  Just like a lot of comedies that have come out recently, it's another collection of stale, predictable gags.  I did laugh at spots--hell, I was trying to get my money's worth.  But for a Zucker film, I expect a lot funnier.  I don't expect every single gag having to do with either someone getting hit in the head or children getting hit by cars.  Since the film is PG-13, there's not as much room for the raunchiness that pervaded throughout parts 1 and 2, but in place we have nothing but cheap slapstick.  The other movies were funny, but funny in a way that you laugh your butt off the first time, but by the second viewing the jokes have already run dry.  After all, the Wayans aren't known for their large wits.  So I was waiting to badmouth this film and go on about how David Zucker knows how to handle the spoof genre, while the Wayans don't.  But in fact, the Wayans have handled the genre better.  At least I got some laughs out of the first two films.  The only two returning members from the first two movies are Anna Faris and Regina Hall.  The latter I don't mind, though she's no Lucille Ball, but Faris is a terrible comic actress.  I don't know why I'm reading posts on message boards, saying that she has real talent and she'll move onto bigger and better things.  I already came to conclusion, after watching the original ""Scary Movie,"" that her timing and delivery was totally off.  She has the beauty, but that's all she's got.  So for all you women who think guys will regard any beautiful actress as ""good,"" you're sorely mistaken--or at least you can exclude me.  Meanwhile, women regard Vin Diesel as a good actor, yet he couldn't slap on a facial expression if his life depended on it--but that's drifting into another issue.  The rest of the cast is quite talented, but they seem to be there simply to add on more star power.  It's one of those films where there are cameos for the sake of cameos.  They're simply there so the young ones can go ""Ooooh, that's Master P"" or ""Ooooh, that's Ja Rule.""  Leslie Nielsen has a small and unfortunately thankless role.  After the ""Naked Gun"" movies he has drifted into oblivion, which is really a shame because he's truly a comic genius.  Charlie Sheen has shown his knack for comedy in past films like ""Hot Shots"" and ""Major League,"" but he is also wasted in this movie.  He appears totally embarrassed to be in this movie, and looks almost like he's playing a caricature of himself. 
So don't get suckered--or should I say Zuckered--in like me.  This is less on the scale of ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun,"" and more on the scale of ""Baseketball"" and ""My Boss' Daughter""--other mediocre flicks directed by Zucker.  If you want to see all the funny gags, just watch the trailer.  As a matter of fact, the ""I am Morpheus"" gag with Eddie Griffin with him saying ""I am prophesizing"" and Queen Latifah as his wife responding with ""I'm gonna prophesize my foot up your a**"" isn't even in the movie!  Is it a scheme to lure audiences into buying the DVD (with the deleted scenes)?  Maybe. 
My score:  5 (out of 10)",Scary Movie 3
121,ryanpersaud-59415,This is a Good Movie.,7,12 October 2021,"The Good: This is the best Scary Movie of them all. It is a hidden gem, lost because critics - in their most 2000s of ways - looked down upon this franchise and prejudged this one too. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it smart? No. It's crude, it's stupid, it's juvenile...it's funny as hell.What separates SM3 from the rest is how the PG-13 completely shifted the comedic tone of this movie. Yes, you have your sex and bodily humour jokes. But you also have incredibly clever visual gags, slapstick humour, puns, turns of phrase and legitimately funny observations about the movies this one skewers.Speaking of which, choosing to basically meld the plot of Signs and The Ring together (with a couple references to other movies here and there) was the best structure of the entire series. While what happens is nonsensical, it's a legitimate story structure that ends at the right place in a natural way. I see that as an upgrade.The cast is clearly having a blast here and this movie is just ELECTRIC with the energy. It transports you into this kooky, funny cartoony world where anything can happen. I wholeheartedly recommend this one. Honestly.The Bad: I mean, what can I say that's truly ""bad"" here? It looks cheap? Yes. It's juvenile? Yes. It sometimes goes overboard with the pop culture references? Yes. Yadda yadda, critics had a field day with this one 18 years ago.The Ugly: While Scary Movie (and ""parody"") movies persisted after SM3, honestly, this one is on another level of funny. It just GETS its source material and knows what it's doing to parody them. I can't say that for almost any of the other movies or imitators.",Scary Movie 3
122,MsMovie,"A genuinely dumb, yet funny movie!",5,26 January 2004,"This film was sending up some of my favourite movies, Signs, The Sixth Sense, etc, and yet I couldn't help but laugh at some of the genuinely funny spoofs. My personal favourite was the part where Charlie Sheen's character says something like ""the dog's are acting strangely"", and a dog goes past driving a tractor, etc. Yes, it's Airplane/ Flying High humor, it's stupid, it's obvious at times very ridiculous, but if you enjoy these kind of movies, and you get all the in-jokes, then you will really like this film.I really didn't expect too much -when you put a 3 on the end of a film's title it's always a worry. (Yet, we have Lord of the Rings part 3, which is fantastic and American Wedding, so maybe I lied!)This movie is less sexually oriented than the first, but it has plenty of low-brow humor in it still, and it's well worth watching.Perhaps wait for it on DVD, as it isn't very long and if you're going to pay $10 to see a movie, you should at least see Cold Mountain or The Last Samurai where you'll get value for your $1!",Scary Movie 3
123,francoischristana,Very boring!,3,20 October 2021,"I don't understand production companies outlook, when you create a movie franchise and the first/second movie was a success you should keep the director & writers who contributed to this achievement, in this case I'm talking about the Wayan brothers.

The only moment that had me fascinated was the brawl between Brenda & Tabitha.",Scary Movie 3
124,miro-6,Underrated funny movie,8,27 October 2003,"When I figured out that this movie is not written and directed by Wayans family I decided to don't watch it. When I saw that IMDB users rated this movie 5.5 I strongly decided to don't watch it. Later my girlfriend pushed to go and I have to say to her: ""Thanks"". This movie is really funny, no more and no less than the other 2. So my suggestion is: GO AND LAUGH. You will not ask your money back.",Scary Movie 3
125,filmbuff-36,"What? A ""Scary Movie"" that's actually funny? Say it's not so!",7,30 October 2003,"Many movie critics bent over backwards to heap tons of praise on the original ""Scary Movie,"" a film that I felt was as funny as getting a root canal. In contrast, ""Scary Movie 3"" has received mostly negative reviews from the same critics who liked the original, despite being a much funnier movie.During the course of 90 minutes of silliness, ""American Idol"" judge Simon Cowell is ventilated by gunfire after giving a negative review to a rap battle, Michael Jackson (or a reasonable facsimile) is dangled over a balcony while the man holding him says ""How do YOU like it?"" and a news room bursts into a spontaneous football party a la a Coors Light commercial. Comedy is subjective, and instances like these will either attract viewers like flies or turn them away in droves.Television anchorwoman Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) seeks to investigate a mysterious crop circle pattern in a Virginia farm cornfield. At the same time, her good friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) tells her about a killer videotape that she has seen that supposedly curses the viewer via a phone call to die seven days later. Cindy watches the tape and gets the phone call, realizing she has a week to find a way to stop the supernatural killer from striking.The owner of the farm, Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen), is a former minister having a crisis of faith following the unfortunate death of his wife. Meanwhile, his brother George (Simon Rex) dreams of becoming a rapper and hopes to hook up with Cindy, whose psychic son has Brenda as a teacher along with Tom's daughter. Circumstances force them all to join forces to discover the connection between the videotape and a possible alien invasion.If you haven't guessed, the plot is a mix between ""Signs"" and ""The Ring"" with ""8 Mile"" thrown in haphazardly for good measure. The storyline is a threadbare at best, just an excuse to poke fun at the latest box office thrillers with a general vibe of goofiness and satire. In terms of coherent story telling, the movie is a train wreck, but as an exercise in throwing funny things up on screen, the jokes arrive right on schedule.What sets this film apart from the two previous movies in this series is perhaps the mindset in general. ""Scary Movie"" and ""Scary Movie 2"" were both R-rated envelope pushers, showing disgusting sex-related physical jokes never-before-seen in movie theaters. Comedy, however, has always been in the suggestion of naughtiness, and not the actual presentation of it. The PG-13 rating here holds the movie within a general safe bound, keeping the filmmakers under control and forcing the humor to focus on funny line delivery, not gross bodily functions.Not that ""Scary Movie 3"" skimps on all bodily functions, but at least it's nothing repugnant this time.Director David Zucker, whose credits in this genre include co-directing ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Airplane!"" is certainly a much more accomplished director than the series' previous helmer Keenan Ivory Wayans. His scenes do not drag on to the point of exhaustion though they still could have benefited from more editing in some cases. Camera action is more lively this time out too, as opposed to the static movement in the first two films.Acting here is not outstanding, but it gets the job done considering the circumstances. Returning for the third time, Faris has not improved her supposed thespian skills one iota from the first film. She's still the same brainless character who has no business surviving a horror movie besides for being the main character.Sheen just goes through the motions, neither quite satisfying nor upsetting viewer expectations. He really isn't the right type to be spoofing Mel Gibson's nuanced performance, but he does deliver his goofy lines with the appropriate straight face.Cameos and other small roles abound here to various degrees of success, including spoof king Leslie Nielsen as the President, who steals practically every scene he's in with little effort. Queen Latifah, Eddie Griffin and George Carlin all show up parodying characters from ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" though it's obvious all their scenes where written quickly to cash in on that film and lack any other true purpose or meaning in this movie.Where ""Scary Movie 3"" ultimately fails though is ironically in the same department as the first two movies. What made ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" so great, as well as pre-Zucker spoofs like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" and ""Blazing Saddles,"" is that all those films parodied entire genres and not just specific films.All three ""Scary Movie"" films take the easy route by attacking current blockbusters, just like every spoof movie since ""Spy Hard"" has. Unfortunately, what is funny now will not be funny three years from now. The horror genre has so many conventions ripe for satire that it's a shame that ""Scary Movie 3"" seeks mediocrity in an already overcrowded market.Seven out of ten stars. Lacks the motivation and ability to become a classic, but still a fun romp on the old theater. You should probably wait until video to see it though.",Scary Movie 3

127,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Scary Movie 3,6,14 December 2003,"Boo! Did that scare you? Maybe the large amount of horror releases this year did. It is just amazing how quickly the American public can go from a period after September 11th when all slasher flicks were deemed insensitive to the present day when two R-rated blood fests are tops at the weekend box office. It's also amazing to see how quickly the spoof film could go from being a hot commodity to just plain leftovers. Though the genre was invented long before the original Scary Movie, this horror spoof regenerated the failing genre when it grossed $157 million by the end of its run in 2000. A year later Scary Movie 2 opened to a less then stellar $71 million end but enough money was made to deem it a success and green light another sequel. But now the third film in the series may be the bottom of the barrel as it has had a difficult road to completion with the creators of the franchise dropping out and several false production starts. Will Scary Movie 3 fail at the box office? Not likely with the low production budget, effective marketing campaign, and enough product placement to cover any a bit of those costs. Then why is this considering the low end of the stick? You have to admit that the story or lack there of can't get worse.The story . Well, there really isn't one except for the fact that it spoofs films like The Matrix Reloaded, The Ring, The Others, and Signs. But besides that fact, there is some small plot trying to squeak through. Cindy Campbell, now fresh from college, gets her first big break as a TV news reporter when strange crops circles appear in the corn fields of farmer Tom Logan. In her investigation, she also discovers a videotape that kills its viewers seven days after they watch it and her nephew is one of them. Cindy is now called up by the president to help prevent an alien invasion and stop of the deaths cause by the mysterious tape. The story for Scary Movie 3, like it was said before, really doesn't exist but when is this never case with any spoof film? Bottom-line is that the third installment in the horror-spoof franchise is less consistent with its weak plot then the other two films but it comes to these films, you just have to leave your head at the door. For some movie-goers, that can be easier said then done.There are plenty of prominent performers in this cast but most of them are mere cameos then featured roles. Anna Faris once again appears as Cindy Campbell in the spoof franchise. She obviously has the comedic talent for these types of films but if she doesn't get out of things sooner or later, she'll be stuck in these roles for the rest of her career. That would be quite unfortunate because Faris clearly has the talent to branch out into other genres. Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards appear, if not briefly, together in the film but it is Sheen who gets the bigger role. The biggest laughs of the film came from him especially his battle with Michael Jackson (or at least, a decent look-alike). The biggest disappointments came from Queen Latifah and Eddie Griffin, who play the Oracle and Orpheus. It wasn't their performances but their lack of appearance in the film that left many unsatisfied. The two are promoted pretty decently in the trailers and television ads yet they appear less then ten minutes in the entire film. Miramax should ashamed! The opening sequence featuring Pamela Anderson and Jennie McCarthy is just pathetic and borders on the line of stupid funny and just plain stupid. There are many blondes in the world that resent the `dumb blonde' comments . They must be on the verge of killing these two. Not one bit of their sequence is funny and showcases they can't act even in a spoof feature that doesn't require much acting in the first place.Overall, Scary Movie 3 scares the movie-going audience for all the wrong reasons. Will there ever be an intelligent spoof film or is that just another pipe dream? Not to say that the film is not funny, it is a large improvement from the last Scary Movie feature, but there has to be a better way to get laughs then relentless slap-stick that gets more annoying then some of the films it tries to spoof. The running over of the kid got repetitive quickly and many of the sequences featuring it could have been ditched. One scene that got a little too provocative featured Darrell Hammond as a priest who baby-sits Cindy Campbell's nephew. Though there are many out there who are not Catholic, there are plenty who will find the sequence insensitive and mean-spirited. In fact, the entire feature is mean-spirited but manages to crack off a few decent laughable moments to make the film all the less tolerable. If you want intelligent filmmaking, effective humor, a stellar cast, a believable story, and a memorable time at the movies then this is not your film by a long shot. Scary Movie 3 requires nothing of the audience but to leave their heads at the door much like the filmmakers themselves.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C-)",Scary Movie 3

This just didn't have much of a plot and the aliens looked like they were added just to make up for the lack of plot.  Cindy or Sidney, whatever her names is, plays the completely clueless girl from I&II and Brenda's part in this movie was also very good.  But then it just kind of died.

131,ChrisTreborn,Best of All Scary Movies. I Loved It Very Much !!!,10,5 April 2005,"I was eager to watch this movie when I saw it previews, but I had few doubts. The previous Scary movies were good but were cheap at heart for giving stupid jesters with adult matters. I got irritated while watching it in front of my family. But when it came to 3rd chapter, it's a whole different story.Scary Movie 3 (Spoilers******) Based on the characters created by Wayans brothers the Scary Movie series takes a new turn when it took up by the acclaimed director of the cult comedies, David Zucker. Like his previous works he gives a respected look to the rude comedy by transforming the sexual offensive teenage movie into a family enjoyable humor. That makes this movie the best one in the Scary franchise.Teenage Cindy (innocent Anna Faris) is now grown up, she is working as a news reporter in a TV channel. Not satisfied about her current status she wanted to do some important stories like strange crop circles recently appeared on a farmer's corn field. Even taking care of her best friend's child, Cindy is not seeking for any relationship. But things are going to be peppy when she meets up with a young rapper George (onscreen portrayal wise a carbon clone of Eminem, Simon Rex).Anna Faris rocked as mature Cindy but the real star in the movie was David Zucker, he marked his signature again, it's pretty funny to watch such unrelated silly things on background when the story goes. With a dream cast of top celebrities including Pamela Anderson, Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Simon Cowell, Fat Joe, Queen Latifah, Ja Rule and DENISE RICHARDS, Zucker created another Naked Gun movie! I always loved his works.And last but not least, How can be David Zucker movie without the Superman Leslie Nielsen! I was missed SUPERSTAR Leslie Nielsen for a long time and he just came back in his younger days by this movie. Nielsen rocked as American President.It's good the Wayans brothers didn't take part in the movie, if that happened it should have Sucked. Due to their absence and the presence of master of spoof cinema David Zucker, Scary Movie 3 is the best hilarious movie to DATE! Best wishes for his upcoming 4th Scary Movie!""I give this movie 10 out of 10!""",Scary Movie 3
132,james_corck3,Despite the second movie...you will laugh to dead with this one,7,29 December 2005,"First of all, once you are entering the movie theater or switching on your DVD player, you must get rid off the first two movies. The first movie was like the project made by two film students with some good performers, a retarded screenplay and sex-shop stuff. The second movie was like a no-sense of gags based in famous box-office movies of the moment and a quite impossible to forget gag of Nike Basketball advertisement. This movie is what Scary Movie should be from the beginning. A David Zucker film. Every gag has it's explanation, and well, at least all of them are really funny, or near from the hysterical laugh. And the best of all, it focuses on four movies (Matrix reloaded, The ring, 8 mile and Signs) and it joins all of them with a powerful screenplay, because yeah, this movie has the best screenplay of the trilogy. About plot? No. About funny and laughs? Oh yeah! The girl of the Ring trapped under the house of Signs where the guy of 8 mile lives? My god!!! Why I didn't have that idea before? The Architech being spanked and ridiculed? Yes please please please!!! Show me more of the green old man. The crazy and shocked kid of The Ring transformed into a target for bumps, hits and punches?

Some scenes were a bit overworked and in some places I think they tried too hard to make it funny. Anna Faris delivered a superb performance once again, and Charlie Sheen makes a new appearance. The plot was as copy- cat as always and I also thought that the whole idea of the aliens coming down was funny, it was also clever how all the stories managed to connect.

The scene where Denese Richards is pinned between the car and the tree and, after Charlie Sheen kisses her, he pulls a spark plug out of his mouth. The scene where Leslie Neilsen, as the President of the United States, looks at the Indian and proceeds to say ""Hi, how are ya?"", ""Hi, how are ya?"" over and over again. It just cracks me up. I also like the part where the alien explains how they pee out of their fingers. Leslie Neilsen raises his finger, says ""So we aren't so different after all"" and pees out of his finger.

138,abyoussef,It's over,2,27 October 2003,"by Dane Youssef""Scary Movie 3"" marks the end of an era. The first was a funny romp, worthy of the Zuckers (and Abrhams) and the Farrelys.The entire Wayans clan coming together, roasting popular movies like franks on a bonfire. Gay, sh*t, dick, pee, cum and retard jokes galore. It was near brilliant.The best part of it was that it was a collage of stupidity, cleverness, goofiness, vulgarity and pop culture, like the Wayans' ""In Living Color,"" the first ""Scary Movie"" proves that the Wayans' are a tribe of talent.The second in the series, ""Scary Movie 2"" (after promising there would be no sequel-- Marlon was quoted as saying, ""We sold out. The offered us money and we jumped at the chance""), opened with a premise so brilliant and so hilarious, the movie could never live it down.The ingenious opening on ""The Exorcist"" before the opening credits with James Woods and Andy Richter was a legendary moment in comedy. ""The Exorcist"" has been spoofed countless times before (many, many times before... but I can honestly say, never this well. The way it's written, the way it's directed, the way it's played, the way it's planned... this movie achieves some kind of feat for building so much out of such an over-worked premise. That one opening sequence almost makes the movie at least worth renting.""Scary Movie 3"" is largely a fault of the studio. The house has been brought down, the curtain calls have been had... but Miramax just won't find a new franchise. It's just so sad. Everything, EVERYTHING that was once good and pure is no long gone. Even the Wayans themselves. Zucker is just back doing what he does best... or maybe just often. This is his invention and no one does it better than him, but maybe the problem is the machine-gun spoof (called so because jokes fire on automatic like out of an automatic gun) has just been run into the ground. Maybe the problem is that this movie just wants to goof and imitate and and laugh to itself whereas the original ""Scary Movie"" (and a lot of Zucker's earlier stuff) was directly there to attack.You can tell from the ads alone that this will not be a funny movie. Everyone steps up, references big hits and then makes fun. Not in an attacking sort of way, but just acts goofy and silly. They're all just having fun, not making fun.And because it's directly from the co-inventor of this entire genre, he brings his own people to the table. Leslie Neilsen, Jenny McCarthy and many of the instruments that he used since he started out.You know, it's so funny and strange. MAD magazine can do this forever. SNL... well, USED to be able to do this, but it now it seems like SNL should close down itself. For some reason, some spoof artists can just keep going till' the drop. Others should just cash in their chips and quit while they're ahead. No sense in beating a single note together.The problem with ""Scary Movie 3"" is the same thing that's wrong with Miramax and perhaps even David Zucker. These people don't seem to realize it's time to move on. That it's over. They're beating a dead horse. Trying to milk a dead cow. The Wayans have moved on.

139,jonsefcik,Turn your brain off and have a good time.,5,2 November 2019,"Objectively, this is a terrible movie, and the sense of humor is really dumb. However, I cannot deny it's really really funny. This movie was a laugh riot when I was a kid, and believe it or not I actually found it even funnier on rewatch as an adult. I laughed really hard, way harder than I should have at a lot of the old jokes I remembered and new ones I never noticed before. It's hard to get a real involuntary laugh out of me, and I involuntarily burst out laughing 10 or 15 times, which is a lot for me. Assigning a numerical score is hard; it's a 3 in terms of objective quality, but an 8 or 9 in terms of entertainment value, so I'll meet somewhere in the middle and give it a 5/10. If you're a fan of stupid humor and just want to turn your brain off and have a good time alone or with friends, this movie'll do the job.",Scary Movie 3
140,Workin_Man,Wow...,10,14 March 2006,"Scary Movie 3: This time around, aim is taken at such horror blockbusters as Signs and The Ring, while films of other genres, including Independence Day, 8 Mile, and The Matrix, are also lampooned. The plot finds Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) trying to help the president (Leslie Nielsen) thwart an alien attack while also facing crop circles and a mysterious video tape. That is basically the plot summary in a nutshell.Well... all I can say about Scary Movie 3 is that it's the most gut bustingly hilarious, laugh your ass off movie I have ever seen in my entire life!! This movie is genius!! I have never been so impressed with a comedy in my life. It made me laugh so much that I was in tears by the end. I was laughing so hard during the wake scene that I almost fainted!! I was feeling very light headed after the wake scene was over.",Scary Movie 3
141,ElmStreetsLastBrat,Better than the first two,5,25 February 2007,"""Scary Movie 3"" is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. It is so much funnier than the other two and the gags are better. Of course this film isn't great by any means, but it still really funny. From Charlie Sheen waking up in bed and hitting his head on the lamp, not once, but twice, to the little Ring girl coming out of the TV and leaning over to get the water out of her ears. The humor was much better written in this film too. The jokes were funnier and the actors were funnier. I like the first two Scary Movies, but this one just has all the better jokes. Jeremy Piven was great in a couple of scenes as news anchor Ross Giggins. I thought it was so funny when Cindy, her boss, and the black janitor were fighting over the teleprompter and Ross was reading everything that was on it. And the black janitor wrote ""I've been hitting it with Giggins' woman for ten years. She likes her some chocolate"" and Ross is just reading away, not even realizing what he said. I thought that was one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Charlie Sheen was great as the farmer Tom. I normally don't consider him funny but he was perfectly cast in this film. Besides Anna Faris as Cindy, of course, I thought the character of George was the funniest character in this film. I mean, what's funnier than a redneck white guy trying to be a black rapper? It's so funny because he doesn't realize just how bad he really is. I laughed till I had tears in my eyes. ""Scary Movie 3"" isn't a great film by any means but it's definitely the funniest out of all the Scary Movie films. I think this one is even better than #4. The jokes and humor just work in this film. Sure this film won't win any awards but it will definitely put a smile on your face, especially if you're a fan of slapstick humor, like I am. Thank you for reading my review!",Scary Movie 3
142,canadian58,Good slapstick fun,7,10 March 2013,"In the Scary Movie franchise, you have to turn your brain off when entering the theater. This third entry is no different, although it has been dialed down to a PG-13 level to attract a younger audience. This made me extremely skeptical when going to see this, but since it had Charlie Sheen, I gave it a chance, and I'm glad I did. The first Scary Movie had a few scenes where I cried, I was laughing so hard. The second didn't quite reach that level, but was a decent enough time-passer. This entry has a couple of monstrous laughs, and constant chuckles throughout. It's consistently funny, although some of the jokes miss completely, there are so many gags it's barely even noticeable. The special effects are terrible, but it doesn't matter here.One thing I really like about this movie, is that there are so many familiar faces in the cast. Of course, Anna Faris and Regina Hall return, added to the cast are Charlie Sheen, Leslie Nielsen, Anthony Anderson, George Carlin, Queen Latifah, and Eddie Griffin. It's fun to see so many good actors come together in a silly meaningless comedy like this.Even though it's dialed down in terms of crude sex jokes, this movie isn't any less funny than the first, and hands down, it's way better than the second. 7/10",Scary Movie 3
143,grumpyass,Not As Good As I Hoped...,6,25 October 2003,"First off as maybe many are, this was a disappointment of a movie.  It wasn't as good as I was hoping for.  I was pretty amped for this movie too. Now I did thorghoutly enjoy the first and second but this was a disaster. The only really plot came from The Ring, Signs, The Matrix, and 8 Mile. There weren't really any other spoofs in it but those four.  Now it was funny so it's good if you want laughs but I think it being PG-13 made it not as good cause the other ones had that pervertedness to it and all the other good stuff.  If you see it you'll get laughs but don't expect too much from it.",Scary Movie 3
144,Roddy-15,Nice spoof film,8,26 December 2003,"Aliens III, Lethal Weapon III, Matrix Revolutions, Return of the Jedi, Scream III, all these movies have something in common: they are the weakest of a trilogy (keep in mind that Star Wars was once a trilogy).It seems the people behind these films ran out of the ideas they had for the first two in the series. Scary Movie III, however, seems to be a rare exception. Maybe because the first two Scary Movies weren't that good to begin with.In Scary Movie III, the Wayans brother seem to have exploited the good things about the first two: lots of people getting punched, hit with bats, cars, etc, people being stupid, stumbling, etc. And of course, making fun of horror and science fiction films. Last but not least, they seem to have realized that some people don't find disgusting scenes funny at all.This film has a lot of scenes that can make you laugh as long as you like spoof films. The funeral scenes is one of the best I have ever seen. Then there is the alien footage scenes. And the unforgettable scenes mocking the Matrix series.
Many films of this type have been terrible. Mafia, for example, made me leave the theater, and I hadn't done that before, no matter how bad the movie was. Not Another Stupid American Movie was beyond stupid and made me wonder if it was time to stop making this type of films. Scary Movie has revitalized them.",Scary Movie 3
145,happytoms,Better than the second movie but worse than the first,6,11 October 2019,"It's the early 2000s parody formula. All you need is to base the story on few recent and successful high budget movies, make fun of everything and everyone in the most ridiculous ways, have action/horror which mostly leads to comedy, sexy girls and everything else you would expect from a parody.It's a time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days and remember all iconic situations and characters of the movie which aren't that many in this movie compared to the first one.The story is as cliché as you would expect from a parody movie, and it's kinda enjoyable after all these years.
Cliché story, music, effects, and the amazing 2000s vibe works kinda well.Overall I think quite a lot of people will not enjoy it and quite a portion will. Personally, after watching the original movie this feels like not the greatest parody and not the worst one, it's somewhere in the middle around 6 out of 10. It's better than the second movie but worse than the first one.
Would kinda recommend to anyone familiar or not with parodies, but it wouldn't be my first choice at all.",Scary Movie 3

OK well, it's been 2 years and I've gone through phases of watching Scary Movie 3 multiple times a week. I find the movie to be VERY funny and provides tons of classic verbiage in its dialogs and monologues.If you liked Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2 and movies like Stoned Age, Napoleon Dynamite, Tremors 1-4, Half-Baked, Malibu's Most Wanted, Harold & Kumar Go to White Castles, etc...

I enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder, and part one 5 times as much. Odd that the better of the 3 is part 2, but then again i always liked Halloween 2 better then the original as well..maybe its just me. The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye. But that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance. Save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on Video tape, and then Rent it, dont buy it.",Scary Movie 3
149,sackjigler,what to think? (spoilers),6,26 October 2003,"The movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  There were several very random funny parts throughout the movie but most are just ridiculous.  I understand that the jokes from the others were ridiculous as well,  but at least they were funny.  You can only watch people get punched, hit, kicked, knocked down, so many times before it stops being funny, and this movie does it about twenty too many times.  A spoof of 8 mile goes about 10 minutes too long and only provides one minorly funny joke.  The movie has a different feel from the beginning and it's not all bad, but it is not a good movie. Plus, most of the scenes you see in the trailer are not even in the movie. Brief appearances from D.L. Hughley, Eddie Griffin, and Queen Latifah are almost completely unfunny.  The only funny cameo was Darrell Hammond and that's just because it was a good joke, his talent was also wasted.  I wasn't sure if it was trying to spoof Bruce Almighty, but the scene with Jeremy Piven seemed to be ripped straight from the movie.  I caught Leslie Nielsen using a line from Baseketball, as if anyone but me would have even realized it in the theater(although i did enjoy baseketball).  The movie definitely isn't as bad as the 2nd but it's probably better to rent.  It's also kind of disappointing to see Zucker losing his touch.                                   5 out of 10",Scary Movie 3

Me and my friend Madison say a bunch of quotes from this film, such as ""Did I tell you to quit drawing,"" ""Cindy.. the TV's leaking,"" and ""The news is on! Another lil' white girl fell down the well!"" This is a pretty funny movie. The casting could have been better and so could the plot.

This is a good example of what the movie business has come too, and it's sad to see that people have spent over 50 million dollars to see it, is this what society has come to too?

154,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,More of the Same,5,19 April 2014,"As far as spoof comedies go, Scary Movie 3 isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't good either. It's a huge improvement over the awful second film in the franchise, but it fails to deliver enough laughs to be able to recommend it.The film delivers a few laughs here and there thanks to a few surprisingly clever jokes and slapstick bit, but it feels like the writers went for too many cheap jokes and slapstick humor. The two main parodies are Signs and The Ring which the film does an alright job of poking fun at, but there is a lot of wasted opportunity in poking fun of these films as well. One of the problems with the last film as that it parodied films that weren't even part of the horror genre and these moments felt rather forced and out of place than funny. This film suffers from that problem as well parodying 8 Mile and The Matrix. Neither of these moments are funny nor clever and feel like a cheap attempt to parody other recent films that were popular at the time of release. This wouldn't be a problem if the film was not suppose to be a spoof of horror films and these moments weren't taking away screen time that could have been used to poke fun at the films part of the actual genre it's suppose to be spoofing. Anna Faris was alright in the lead, but I was really disappointed by how underused Charlie Sheen was.Scary Movie 3 isn't terrible compared to a lot of other spoof movies out there. It does have a couple of funny moments, but the laughs are far in-between a great deal of cheap jokes and tired slapstick humor to be able to recommend it.",Scary Movie 3

157,stamp1,"Thought it was very funny, BUT...",9,17 November 2003,"I kept laughing all through the movie. So did the rest of the audience in the theater. Therefore, IT WAS FUNNY! The dead body in the casket scene was Over The Top!! Really funny!! The Michael Jackson scene was hilarious!! Queen Latifah was really funny! Spoofing Pamela Anderson/ Tommy Lee video at the beginning was funny. The bit about the Catholic priest babysitting the little boy was also funny. Thought the spoof of the Ring videotape was also very funny, when Queen Latifah went into the video and dragged out the woman & beat the stuffings out of her for being obnoxious in the weird Ring video. I liked the spoof of the Ring better than I liked the movie ""The Ring"", which I really disliked due to the child abuse of the little girl.Some reviewers have gotten upset about the little boy being hit by a car several times, so I thought I would comment on this. 1st, it is very clear that when the boy gets hit in the movie, he is not hurt! Therefore, IT IS NOT REAL!!! In the movie ""The Ring"", when the little girl is killed and then thrown down the well to drown, it seems very real and horrifying. In Scary Movie 3, it is like the 3 Stooges hitting each other, very slapstick and non-threatening cartoon violence. 2ND, NO ONE SEEMS TO REALIZE THAT IT IS A SPOOF OF THE MOVIE ""IDENTITY"", which came out this past spring. That movie was a murder mystery slightly horror film, and twice someone in that movie died by being hit very realistically by a car at a high speed. ALSO, this same type of horrible death happened in ""Final Destination 1 & 2"". So Scary Movie 3 is spoofing all three of these movies. Those grumpy grouchy reviewers who gripe about this obviously didn't see these movies, so they have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER that the writer/director is making fun of these other horror movies. It would be nice if people go see a movie making fun of other movies, THAT THEY FIRST GO SEE THE MOVIES THAT ARE BEING MADE FUN OF!!! Then maybe they would appreciate the humor in the spoofing film!The one real complaint I had was that I thought this movie should have been rated an R rating. The language was really gross and full of cursing, and I don't think anyone under the age of 15 should see this film. There were also sexual content and innuendo that I would not want my child to see if he was still under 15 or 16 years old. (He's 31 now, so I have no say about it now!!) :)I saw some 4 and 5 and 6 year olds in the theater audience, and I think their parents should have been arrested for child abuse, this was not a Disney cartoon movie for 4 year olds!!! My God, parents, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING WHEN YOU TAKE LITTLE CHILDREN TO THESE MOVIES???? AND THEN AMERICA WONDERS WHERE ALL THE PSYCHOS COME FROM WHO SHOW UP DERANGED AND CRAZY ON THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW!!! They had parents who were stupid and could care less about their children, who drag their kids to violent and vulgar and sexually perverse movies, that is where they come from. But this movie is very funny for adults, especially if they have seen the horror movies being spoofed previously. You will enjoy this movie better if you go see it at the cheaper matinee prices, not the full price in the evenings.",Scary Movie 3
158,arson83,WAIT FOR VIDEO!...,5,24 October 2003,"Don't get me wrong, Scary Movie 3 was very funny. In fact, some of the jokes had me laughing out loud (the fact that I can't remember which can't be a good thing, although that may be because it's 1:35am).That said, I found it a big waste of money. If I rented it, it would have been great. I might even buy it if I find it for under 10 bucks in a year or so. But paying $9.25 (times two people) to see a movie that was literally 75 minutes is not worth it at all (it says ""Running Time: 90 minutes"" but it lies, it started at 8:15 and by 9:35 I was in my car). Maybe I missed 10 minutes after the credits (like that oh-so-classic ""Master of Disguise"" ).Overall... it was a decent movie. Not as good as the original (haven't seen more than half of the 2nd yet). A lot of the parodies were hilarious (making fun of ""Signs"" with the line ""Wait, they can fly spacecrafts here but they can't turn door handles"" and the whole ""a-truck-is-keeping-my-wife-played-by-Denise-Richards-alive"" made my night), but some were just kind of weak (some of the ""Ring"" ones).

It's 1,000,000 times better then any other recent spoof movies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, and Disaster Movie. Those movies gave spoof movie a bad name. It's a lot funnier when you spoof a celebrity and the spoof movie actually has the celebrity they are spoofing. Like the part in this movie when they made fun of American Idol and it actually had Simon Cowell in a brief cameo. It was hilarious when they made fun of 8 Mile but didn't they forget that this is called 'Scary Movie 3' and it's supposed to spoof scary movies not music/drama's or sci-fi's like 'The Matrix'. But I can see why spoofed those movies so the plot of this movie could make more sense. This spoof movie actually has a plot and the other spoof movies I mentioned hardly even have a plot at all.

I thought that was pretty funny, don't ask why. The best actor int he movie was Charlie Sheen. He had some funny moments. However, the rest of the film proved to be a little boring. Many of the jokes fell flat.

Scary Movie 2 was awful and terrible and not remotely funny whatsoever. It seem like the Scary Movie series was done. But not so. Now we get a new director named David Zucker (Airplane and Naked Gun series) and some of the same cast from the first minus Shawn and Marlon Wayans and added some funny spoof from Signs, The Ring and Matrix Reloaded and now we have a step up from Scary Movie 2.Anna Faris is back as Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall is back as Brenda Meeks. Let's face it without Anna and Regina, the Scary Movie series can just basically stop. They both are hilarious.

It is not as funny as The R rated Scary Movie but it has that Airplane comedy feel and it made me chuckle a lot and is 10 times better than the second installment.So if you want a good laugh at some crazy spoofs, watch Scary Movie 3.",Scary Movie 3

The movies parodied include: Signs, the 6th Sense, 8 mile, the Ring, and in the alternate ending, the Incredible Hulk. The alternate endings available on the DVD, altho shot on a noticeably much lower budget, were much funnier than the original. Perhaps this is because I had actually seen the movies being parodied in the alternate endings, but I liked them better. The ""6th Sense"" ending, which focused on Cody, was pretty stupid, even if you have actually seen that movie. I didn't see Signs, and don't plan to, but my friend informed me that a running joke in the movie, ""swing away"", is based on that. I didn't think it was funny, and I thought it sucked that the pivitol points of the movie were based on that.",Scary Movie 3

Most people didn't like this movie because they probably compared it to the first which is hard to find a movie funnier than the first other than The Producers, Office Space and The Blues Brothers. Most of the jokes in this movie were hilarious. The reason that they went from an R rating (the first 2) to a PG-13 is because they wanted to attract more people, so people over 13 can go. They got a lot of good actors to play in this movie, like Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris, Leslie Nelson, Queen Latifa etc...... One of the funniest parts of this movie was when they were making fun of the Matrix with the oracle and Morpheous in the same room. They made a great job making fun of every movie.

Anna Faris, playing Cindy Campbell, and Simon Rex, playing George, make Scary Movie 3 a thrilling and crazy adventure. Cindy Campbell is troubled by the unusual problems Cody (played by Drew Manheim) has throughout the movie.Scary Movie 3 was crazy, funny, and stupid. This movie was crazy because of the aliens. The aliens made Scary Movie 3 become more interesting and added a twist. This movie was funny! Every other thing that happened in Scary Movie 3 was funny. I personally think the battle was a big laugh.Stupid would be a good definition for Scary Movie 3. Poor Cody helps make this movie so stupid. It seems Cody gets forgotten by Cindy Campbell and George several times. He also seems to get hit with many things: the car(several times), a hammer, and a door.This movie seemed to revolve around the movie The Ring.

Then, with the help of George (Simon Rex) Cindy has to stop an alien invasion.I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I've heard a lot of people say negative things about the plot, jokes, etc. why? because those people think too much!

Well it's not too hard to explain. In short: The Ring + Signs. It also tries to be bad while still being good (It tries to be ""R"" rated while being ""PG-13""). Some scenes are sharp and funny, like the opening scene, but others are just way too far-out and/or gross, like the end. The ending is also dissapointing. But to the story overall, it's in a special area of films that fall between the good and the bad. It tries to be as good as spoof films like Austin Powers, or the first Scary Movie, but at least it's better then some spoofs like Not Another Teen Movie or Scary Movie (2 That is). Suprisingly, it has alot of cameos, mainly by African-American actors (Macy Grey's in it for a short short time, she only has one line (The film never supplies a reason why she has to be in the film)). But now bringing up the subject of the actors, the film takes a huge part at making Black jokes which can be funny for some actors (Regina Hall is hilarious once again in this film) but others, it just doesn't work. So, the fact of the matter is, don't waste your time in the theaters. Wait for if you want for DVD, but then, it's still not worth it. P.S. In the trailers a scene shows Eddie Griffen, Queen Latifah, and Anna Faris in a scene spoofing the original Matrix (Eddie: ""I am Orpheous!""), but in the film, this scene, which seemed promising is no where to be found at all. Let's hope it'll be a deleated scene on the DVD. C+ -or- * * (Two Stars).",Scary Movie 3

175,Juansmith,Most of the gags worked; a few didn't.,6,25 October 2003,"Pros:-several very well constructed gags-a dash or two of intelligent humor-immensely better than #2Cons:-slight overuse of slapstick-the occasional joke falls flat
Only in a film like this would you find a parody of a beer commercial... Perhaps it was an homage to the ""Wazzup"" segment in the first film.Segment really is the key word; this film is essentially like an episode of ""Family Guy"", in that each scene really serves as an elaborate setup for a series of gags, and not much concern is given to advancing the plot. This segmented feel works famously in a film which is clearly not meant in the least to be taken seriously, although some jokes, such as the Simon Cowell cameo, seemed forced. While a few gags seemed to come straight out of the Farrelly Brothers handbook of moviemaking, the film tries to stay original with its parodies (if such a thing is possible). Sheen and Faris clearly have a great time in their respective roles.A few running gags clearly marked this as a David Zucker film, particularly the frequent use of slapstick humor. While this seems unnecessarily repetitive at first, it becomes essentially a running gag as one character is repeatedly singled out for each hit. A lot of gags worked; some didn't. I suppose it's to be expected with a film like this. But the film wasn't overshadowed by the numerous woeful comedic leaps of its predecessor during which the audience was expected to be laughing. For the most part this time around, I actually was laughing. Hopefully the Wayans Brothers learned a thing or two from the sidelines.6.5/10",Scary Movie 3

This movie contains the least ""potty- humor"" and is sort of... classy.Everybody in the cast does a great job, and I was really impressed by Charlie Sheen, but the star in the picture is of course Leslie Nielsen. He is a veteran and a master of comedy. He doesn't need to make funny faces or anything to be funny.

181,teddeman,"Possibly, correction, Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen.",1,26 October 2003,"I realize that Zucker movies are supposed to be absurd, but al least the first Airplane' and Police Squad' had organized plots and story lines. Scary Movie 3' was a disjointed unfunny joke.  Over half the scenes in the movie left me confused and disappointed.  It was almost the first movie that I walked out of early (years ago I rented The House of Cats' and ejected the tape from the top-loader VCR after about 20 minutes).  Instead of playing it safe and leaving I punished myself by staying and waiting for the movie to get funny.  It never did.Maybe the movie theater didn't run the opening reel of the film, as the version I saw was ONLY 75 MINUTES LONG.  Even so I was worried when the rep from Dimension films that introduced the film said, `you are among the first people in Baltimore to see this film.  If you like it tell your friends, if you don't maybe come see it again and give it another chance.  Enjoy the film!'  Yeah right.  Who were they tying to fool?  I want to know what the actors in this film were thinking.  The producers must have either offered them a ton of money or only showed them their portions of the screenplay.  The unconnected individual scenes were sometimes amusing but many of the movie rip-offs were wasted.  There was so much potential, especially with the Matrix scenes, but the advance screening audience and I were left high and dry.  Sight gags can only go so far to carry a movie and the ones in Scary Movie 3 were few, fleeting and spread too far apart.The scenes did nothing to advance the plot of the movie.  You will quickly realize that when the first scene with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy both starts and ends with no explanation that the whole film is going to follow the same disjointed pattern.  Save your money.  Save your time (even though you would only be wasting 75 minutes).  Save your sanity.  Save Yourself.  Don't ever watch Scary Movie 3'.0 out of 100.",Scary Movie 3

Simon Rex is a nice addition to the cast for the film also.A large part of the film is in parody to The Ring and many of the scenes which refer to the film have some great moments.

The second and third watchings dull the humour more than just a little bit.If they'd not made 'Scary Movie 2,' and this film held that title, things would have been better. The amount of parody could have been deeper because of greater time between films, and audience interest (namely, my friends' and mine) would have been greater as well. Alas, for that was not to be....On its own (ignoring the '3' in the title), the movie is funny. Again, not laugh-out-loud, watch it sixty times funny, but funny. It delivers hilarious satire of such neo-classics as 'The Ring,' 'Signs,' and '8Mile' to name a few, while also poking fun at the movie industry itself. And Leslie Nielsen's turn as the president is a highlight of the show. However, it falls victim to its own curse: it tries to make a sensible plot out of what should be a romping parody. The whole franchise would be better if they didn't number the titles (i.e., calling them 'Scary Movie,' 'Heck House,' 'General Parody #27G,' and so on would have been better) because numbering the movies and defining them as sequels holds the new movie to expectations it usually can't match.Bottom line: watch 'Scary Movie 3' but don't expect to watch it over and over again like the first movie.",Scary Movie 3

Everyone who has ever acted is in this film and there are so many crazy plot points that i can't really give you a summary but i can tell you that although the film only achieved the dreaded PG-13, the film was still very funny. Toning down on the sick humor that made the wayans bros. such a hit and limiting the language to a single usage of the ""f"" word, the film still went to max on humor in very different but yet very creative ways.

But despite both of those, I was disapointed.The film perhaps works in the sense of moderatly funny scences with a couple laugh out loud moments, but they don't come very often. Even as a spoof this movie doesn't have any direction, it manages to put Signs and The Ring completely combined as its major plot. Why not try a groovy idea of centering the spoof around one movie with minor gags associated to other flicks.However, with the lack of Wayans brothers involved in this movie there is a definete plus in the lack of dick and fart jokes predominantly featured in the first 2 movies. Dick and fart jokes can be effective in certain movies, mainly if not used as a transition.Yeah so back to Scary Movie 3.

He shoulda left this one alone. The Wayans were doing such a good job. The only reason, people did not like the 2nd one is the same reason people did not like most of the sequels of successful movies. Its seldom better than the first one. Of course, we have exceptions like, T2 and Aliens. But they are very rare.Well, the reason I say David does not fit the profile is that, he got carried away with the spoofing and forgot all about giving the audience laughs. I mean, this is supposed to be a scary movie at the heart of it. What the heck are aliens doing in this movie? Now, the Wayans, they stuck to the laughs and after that the spoofs just followed. After watching Scary Movie 3, I was very disappointed. Instantly Scary Movie 2 got a rating of 8/10 from me. Just like Minority Report. That was the other way around. Many did not like Minority Report. Thats only 'cos they did not watch A.I. If they had they woulda loved Minority Report.Anyway, S M 3, does have its moments, especially Anna and the rapper/farmer. Really funny. Leslie had no idea what he was doing in the movie.

I was, however, pleasantly surprised with this.Unlike the first one, this incarnation is not side splittingly funny all the way through, but there was something a little more original about this tertiary installment. They still relied, at times, on the slapstick element, which I do not find amusing. There were fewer deaths and murders in 'Scary Movie 3', and it seemed like more of a spoof than the first one, taking most of it's ammunition from 'The Ring' 'Signs', '8mm', and handfuls from other works. ('The Matrix', Sixth Sense')I have not seen 'Signs' nor '8mm', but I have a vague idea of their plots, this enabled me to appreciate the humour in the film. I wouldn't worry if you haven't seen them, but if you haven't seen at least one version of 'The Ring' (either the Japanese original or the American remake), I would seriously consider a viewing before attempting 'Scary Movie 3'.There are some good cameo's in the film, it is Leslie Nielson as the president towards the end of the film which allowed the film to finish on a high.Worth a watch, I felt I got my money's worth (But I did go on bargain Tuesday - £3.50 a ticket).

Nearly everybody in the packed theater was laughing, and it was hard to hear the next lines. Up to this day, it is still just as funny.Zucker, Mazin, and Proft prove to pull off a clever and witty spoof with the PG-13 rating. However, this was one of the pinpoints in the first 2, the dirty humor. But the Zucker spin on it was just as effective. It's just one of those movies with screwball characters, and honestly, Simon Rex is perfect for his role. He's always screwing things up, and acting like an idiot. Great casting here.All in all, this is a movie to sit back with your buddies and start laughing, because it's one of the strongest in the Scary Movie series. The order IMO goes as follows: 1, 3, 2, 4. Even though 4 is my least favorite, I still enjoyed it.",Scary Movie 3

But Zucker definitely has made his share of  good parody movies (Airplane!, The Naked Gun, Hot Shots)    so I figured it would still be funny despite its PG-13 rating..and for the most part it was. First of all, I will see ANYTHING with Anna Faris in it  from now on. Second, seeing Samara    Morgan get her ass kicked is well worth the ticket price alone. There were some really funny scenes in this movie (the pooping horse scene was one of the funniest things ever), and there were some very boring scenes also (the only    thing worse than the 8 Mile parody in SM3 was the movie 8 Mile). Call me a sicko if you want, but I kind of missed the raunchy R-rated  humor that the Wayans' had in their movies (and Shorty was very much missed,  son). But Scary Movie 3 is pretty dang funny, Anna Faris is amazingly hot, and so I say it's worth seeing (providing that you've seen    The Ring and Signs, otherwise you won't get anything). Grade: B-",Scary Movie 3

David Zucker should stick to producing movies and stay away from the director's chair. However, to be entirely fair, the writing also falls flat. There are some moderately humorous parts; the first 10 minutes with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy are a 'hoot', but it goes straight downhill from there. The recurring '8 Mile' theme just doesn't work, and the so-called humor is just plain stupid. I loved the first 2 Scary Movies, but this one is a flat-out bust. I see Scary Movie 4 is scheduled for release in 2005, also directed by David Zucker. Big Mistake.",Scary Movie 3

David Zucker really saved the scary movie series with this one, after the 2nd one ruined it. the only problem is the scenes they cut out that was seen in the trailer, like the ones with Queen Latifah playing La'Quisha and teaching Cindy how to fight, spoofing the Matrix. Eddie Griffen had a really small role in the scene they show in theaters. but, the scene that they used was still hilarious, with the woman in the curse tape brushing her hair.

Seriously, if you're over 13 and you're looking to laugh, go see it. It doens't have all the disgust of the first two, but it's so much better. It's still got some, but it's awesome.

207,Nasree,One Of The Best Films In Its Own Genre,10,23 December 2003,"When I first saw its trailer, I really thought this movie would be a total letdown. But surprisingly, it is kind of funny. Actually, I think this is the best in the Scary Movie series.It showcases great acting like Anna Faris and Simon Rex (both very hot people) and the plot makes it even more worth watching. The cameos are excellent, especially by Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy and the spoofs don't really have to be understood by watching the spoofed movies. The slapstick humour appeals to everyone and luckily, this time, the sexual humour doesn't fall flat like a deflated balloon.It is certainly one of the best films of its kind, overtaking gross out comedies of this year. Watching it more than twice will never give you the bores and if you are a fan of slapstick comedies, this is a must watch.

Only the little boys laughed. That, and that alone, should tell you how pitifully poor this film was.",Scary Movie 3
209,MaDsKiLz69,Scary- NO. A Movie- YES. Part 3? YES,7,4 February 2006,"I came to this film after getting back from the Gulf. I had not seen a film for three years and felt like I needed to unwind a little, as I was pretty stressed as you can probably imagine.I was immediately struck by the charming Anna Faris. Has this girl got the cutest face or what- certainly a change than the desolate looks I had been used to in the preceeding 3 years! I decided to find out more about this young lady and came across an incredible coincidence- she is 17 days older than me! Unbelievable. I might even join a fan club if such a thing exists.Anyway, on to the film itself. It is basically a parody of several films I have not seen, such as Signs, 8 Mile and Ring. I could not comment on the accuracy of the parody but guess it's pretty spot on as people around me were shouting- ""its like that bit on Signs!"" and other similar stuff. The film is directed with a devil-may-care attitude, jokes are fired at you like bullets from an Iraqi bunker! If there is a problem with the film its probably that many of the jokes will be missed when you are busy laughing at the previous joke, or even the joke before that.Mr Sheen polishes up on laughs in this film, even surpassing his performance in Hot Shots part Deux. He is truly a master of comedy timing, able to wring laughs from even the most jaded cinemagoer- a talent he no doubt perfected during his wilder years.Finally, I feel I must mention Leslie Nielson. I don't want to waste words here- the guy is funny. Thats it. Funny.In summary, the title of the film is 66.6% correct, but that is irrelevant if you want a good laugh. I'm going to watch Jarhead now. See you soon!",Scary Movie 3

Everyone seems to love it, but I just don't get it. It wasn't funny. From the first scene, I could tell the rest of the movie was going to be crap. The actors weren't funny, either. Normally I like Charlie Sheen, but his performance didn't tickle a single amused fiber in my body. The only actors I didn't find stupid, bad or annoying were the little boy, Cody, and Queen Latifa. The crude jokes just added to my looking at my watch. SOOOOOOOO TERRIBLE!!! If you have any intellect AT ALL, then do not watch this movie.

But what the hell happened?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, i thought the cast and crew change would help matters, but its even worse.
Within 20mins i'd smiled twice. Not one laugh, the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor. The fact that at this point in writing, the majority of people on this site have voted it 10/10 has made me feel physically ill.

They had no jokes, no gaffs, and very limited spoofs. by the end of the movie it was so far off the mark you wondered what on earth the director was trying to do. Obviously we aren't meant to look too much into these kind of films, but it is meant to be a spoof comedy. It turned out as a random clot of stupid scenes with no relevance, which were neither spoof, nor comedy. A few scattered funny moments with Charlie Sheen but otherwise this was very moderate.

It was fresh and different at the time and it was a product of the Wayans brothers. It was chuck full of vulgarity, racial jokes, and other types of dark comedy. Then came Scary Movie 2. I'm glad I didn't go see this in the movies cuz this one really sucked seriously. I wonder what the W-boys were thinking. The freshness was gone and...it was just a bad movie. And then with other spoofs like Not Another Teen Movie, I thought the spoofs were coming to an end cuz they started getting too stupid.Then came Scary Movie 3! This film was COMPLETELY different from the other two because its humor was a different type of humor. It bruoght back the atmosphere of the truly funny spoofs like AIRPLANE, the NAKED GUN trilogy, and HOT SHOTS. This movie is funny or not, depending on the type of comedy you like. I like comedy films that focus on smart, genuine, fresh humor rather than films that rely generally on sex, drug, and racial jokes.

Leslie Nielson from the Naked Gun movies had an incredibly pointless role as the retard president. Faris looked insanely hot as always. It was really fun to see the dude from season 1 of What I like About You in a movie as well. Anthony Anderson was oftentimes hilarious in his reprisal of Mikhi Phiefer's role in 8-mile. The greatest weaknesses of the film are the Matrix and 8-Mile references. The 8-mile stuff was great for the trailer-gag but resulted in a huge lull in the comedy. Also, who even bothers to parody Matrix part 1 anymore? That movie does an excellent job of making fun of itself in the sequel. Overall, SM 3 is better than part 2 but a disappointment overall.

If you're looking for some of the greatest slapstick comedy in film history and some drop dead funny cameos, you've come to the right place. This is a perfect example of an entirely underrated comedy. The references to all of the movies to which it concerns are spot on, I especially liked the Matrix ones, in which Queen Latifah and George Carlin are so great, and so quotable. So, if you're into David Zucker's other movies, you'll love this one to death, just as I do.

Whats really good about this movie is that it didn't try to be anything but a parody which makes it all the more entertaining...and to some extent, not cheezy. True , some of the jokes might be corny, but as a whole I thought this movie was pretty funny...and to really laugh you have to have seen the 3-4 movies that they spoof....namely the Others.Also note that for some people who like teen humor, this is not the Wayans Scary Movie as there aren't as many of the usual gay jokes or racial jokes...but it's funny nevertheless.

Number one, the cinemetography and acting and whatnot can make a movie better, but if its funny anyway, you can only not like it so much. Direction isn't everything. And number 2, you need to realize that just because potty humour is potty humour it doesn't mean you can't think its funny. I know that its as funny to a 12 year old as it is to a 78 year old, just because you're trained to have culture doesn't mean that poo isn't culture.The statistics on imdb show that people under 18 and about 45-55 liked the movie (maybe because the 45-55 grew up with airplane) but either way, this movie was hilarious, and anyone looking for plot can go see lost in translation.

Also Charlie Sheen was a plus. A lot of the humor was slapstick (as you can tell from the cast), but that's just fine by me! :)I kept hearing people say during the movie 'I can't believe I payed money to see this.'. But I think they meant to say 'I don't understand the reference they are making right now so I feel dumb.' or 'I don't think it's funny unless it's vulgar. I wish it had more penis like the second movie.'... things like that.My sole complaint is that the movie didn't have a plot. No hint of a plot what so ever. The whole movie is just funny scene after funny scene with no coherency or smooth transitions. That wasn't a big deal though because the movie was funny. And frankly even though it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, it was better than a lot of the crap that gets made.Would I suggest this movie to anyone? I'd suggest it as a rental.

The jokes could only be found funny by someone with the maturity of a 14 year old or younger.  Simon Rex's jokes especially fell flat. When George Carlin appeared, I began to have hope.  Sadly, he never rose to my expectations.  Come on George, you're better than that.  The biggest casting error was Ja Rule as a secret service agent.  He seemed vacant and lost, as if he couldn't remember his lines or he didn't know how he even got on the movie set.  I would try to mention a standout performance, but there were none.

Taking inspiration from movies like The Ring, Signs, The Others, The Matrix and 8Mile (What that one is doing in that list is a mystery to me). Being the third horror spoof in a short time it is nothing new, but still if your interested in a couple of laughs this is the movie to see. There are some nice cameo appearances, like Pamela Anderson, Denise Richards and Michael Jackson (Yeah right :) ). The comedy is as always very sexual orientated and the body parts are flying through the screen. This movie has even some aliens that come to take over the world or .....

I love what the plot was based on (other actual movies). The jokes were hilarious and the actors made it.I believe that Simon Rex who played as Geaorge made the movie. He was the main character that connected the other characters together. Anna Faris was also good. Her character is so silly but funny. Regina Hall as Brenda was hilarious, you would just laugh by her saying something a certain way. Everyone else was good, but these characters caught my attention.In conclusion, I loved this movie. I like the actors and plot. The satires about the different movies were so funny. I can watch this movie over and over again without getting tired off it.",Scary Movie 3

I knew that this was rated PG-13 and was kind of upset because I knew that they wouldn't be in the movie. I heard it was funny from some of my friends but those friends never liked good movies. After I finished watching this movie I felt like I had lost some IQ points, it was probably the dumbest movie of all time and make Aiplane! seem like the history channel. I recommend not seeing this movie if you have any intelligence whatsoever.First off Charlie Sheen was in this movie so I really wasn't expecting much out of him since the last spoof he did Hot Shots: Part Deux. Anna Faris is a horrible actress as well as Pamela Anderson.The point I'm trying to make is that this was just extremely dumb, even if you have seen the movies they are spoofing.

It is so hilarious and has the funniest scenes ever! If you have not seen this movie yet go out and get! It has the stuff and don't you forget it! I love the part with Brenda and April in the kitchen lol (cant give it away) and i love the part with the white rapper talking to his niece in the living room after they day with brenda!!!It is so freakin funny i almost died laughin!!! Matter of fact the first time i watched the movie was on the bus with my friends and we couldn't even hear a single word in the movie because the bus was too loud but just watching what the people were doing and trying to figure out what they were saying was so much fun!!! And Anna Farris is the greatest!!!She is the funniest actress ever and she has the greatest face expressions! I almost died just from watchin how her face looks when she reacts to something! It is the best movie ever for comedies and anyone who wants to die laughing should watch it ASAP!,Scary Movie 3

Some people say that this movie has no point the humor is just...not funny. Well there are some things that everybody must know before watching this movie: 1. Everybody must have watched the ""original movies"" - ""Signs"", ""The Ring"", ""The 8 Mile"" and ""The Matrix"". If you don't see these movies you won't understand ""Scary Movie 3"" 2. We are not expecting an amazingly good play of the actors. We want to laugh! The main point of the movie is to make the serious movies not so dramatic or terrifying. For example a friend of mine has first watched ""Scary Movie 3"" Of course she said that it is unbelievably stupid. After she watched ""The Ring"" and ""The village"" and she understood the movies. And further more the movies didn't look so scary. So in conclusion i can say that this movie is a parody and it is not for everybody.",Scary Movie 3

The director who was also a Wayan brother somehow made the first and second funny.It wasn't even following a plot line from the first 2. They should of called it something different.

The first two Scary Movies were very funny, and, clearly, a lot of people thought them the best. The import, however, of Zucker as director, added, to my mind, a new, zanier dimension.

What type of society are we in that we cannot enjoy a movie that does not promote sex, drugs, or obscene behaviors? That being said, this movie is by no means perfect. It lacks in a lot of areas, just as most parodies do. There seems to be a lack of cohesion to get all of the spoofing in and that takes away from the sense that you are watching a complete movie. I must admit that I do enjoy the comedy of Leslie Nielsen, so I was not disappointed in that respect. So, it was somewhat goofy, but I'll surely take that over some of the outrageously gross things I saw in the first two. Those movies would have been so much better without the unnecessary raunch, possibly the type of movies where a whole family could go and have a laugh, not one where you know that your parents or grandparents would be extremely offended. **1/2 stars as a movie, but I'll give it **** for changing the format back to a more family friendly viewing experience.",Scary Movie 3

257,juliocentric,Better than the first two...,6,24 October 2003,"Scary Movie 3 is a far cry from those brilliant parodies like Airplane or Naked Gun yet it's still much funnier than the first two movies.  A lot of people were griping over the PG-13 rating but this really doesn't hurt the film.  For the first two, whenever the Wayans brothers reached a creative block, they were like ""Well, we'll just blast Cindy with a bodily fluid"" and that's where the R rating came from.  In SM3, Zucker moves the script along rather quickly, getting rid of the need for any gratuitous bodily fluid shots.The first half of this film was excellent, when it was parodying The Ring and Signs separately.  It was bogged down by the parody of 8 Mile (a useless scene created simply for the writer to try and make ghetto black people funny to the audience), but for the most part, contained good jokes and (for the first time ever in the series) minor character development.However, once the second half of the film begins and all the storylines begin to merge, the story loses its focus.  It tries too desperately to make the stories coincide while, at the same time, keep the humor.  There are only one or two good jokes in this half (the footage of the aliens will have you cracking up).  Soon, the film is filled with too many undeveloped jokes and useless characters (Macy Gray, anyone?) and all interest is lost. However, the second half of the film actually contains a moment that is, ironically, scary.  Go figure.The talent in this film is, for the most part, pretty good.  Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris and Regina Hall turn in the best performances in the film (Regina Hall, as with the first two movies, steals every scene she's in).  Some excellent comedic talent is found in Leslie Nielsen and Eddie Griffin; however, it is vastly underused and their being in the film feels like a waste.  The only complaint with the cast would have to be Ja Rule, who plays the President's personal Secret Service escort, and whoever the anemic-looking kid playing Cindy's nephew.  These performances were just awful.  This is like ""nuclear war"" awful.So, yeah, if you want a few good laughs, go see a matinee of this one. It's not worth full price and (considering how much of the trailer didn't make it into the movie) you might want to wait for the DVD instead.",Scary Movie 3
258,ConsequencesShmonsequences,Solid Rental.,8,24 October 2003,"I suggest you see this movie at an ungodly hour so as not to have the experience almost ruined by hoards (we're talking literally 200) of 13 year-olds who gasp, scream, and laugh at the top of the their little lungs because it's the first PG-13 movie they've seen without their parents, as I did. But the experience was not altogether ruined because I was with good company who appreciated the good jokes. It's interesting when you are in a crowd of 20 dozen middle-schoolers and they either don't laugh at the really good jokes or (!)erupt(!)into laughter when a character gets kicked in the groin.Don't run to see this movie, but if you do see it in the theater, wait a few weeks for the little kids to find a new fad. If you choose not to spend $9.00 on a 90min., non-stop, pleasure-fest for the clever side of you(if you have seen all the movies they spoof it only makes it ten times funnier) then this is a definite rental.

261,phantomkiss65,"It has its moments, but...",4,22 October 2003,"All in all this was a very disappointing film (as if the Scary Movie series had high standards to begin with). The plot of this third installment of the series parodies primarely ""The Ring"" and ""Signs"", but it also spoofs several other hit films from the last couple years. In fact, the film seems to focus too much on the spoofs and not enough on a stable plotline.Right off the bat SM3 feels like a different comedy from its preceders. The jokes focused less on sex, drugs, and gross-outs, and more on slapstick comedy, sight gags, and easter eggs. There were quite a few great laughs it got out of me, but the rest of the jokes got only a smirk or a few chuckles at best. There are countless celebrity cameo's here, some of which add to the laughs, but many of them seem almost completely pointless.The movie overall isn't completely terrible, and by all means go check it out if you're curious.

We all say how the good moments are in the trailers. Then when we see the movie we are so let down. I never felt suckered into shelling out six bucks until Scary Movie 3.It's major problem is with excess. This movie has too much of everything. There's too many movies parodied. Too many cameos, too many comedy killer jokes(white hood joke, Simon Cowell getting wacked), too many repeated gags. There's a point where they want you to laugh at a million three stooges kung fu fight sequences that go on way too long where you just want to scream ""OK I get it already!Move On!""And when the plot decides to lurch forward it seems a little random and arbitrary, sorta like a drunken driver lost and driving a sports car he's never driven before.It's just smacking into one car after another. Sometimes it's plows into garbage bags The movie just keeps rolling out one skit and character after another cutting the good ones short in order to cram some more in.Nothing gets to develop not characters, not the jokes, not even the parody of the movies. It has no true central story to hold it together. Towards the end of its 90(thank you) minutes it throws in the same scenes of ghost slapping and kid smacking, and ball kicking that we already saw before. But of course we're supposed to laugh at it.Aren't We?It's a shame and quite embarrassing that one of the Zucker Bros and Kevin Smith have their names on this.

They weren't concerned about the quality of jokes, that is obvious. They were more concerned with how they could get more people in the movie and make lots of money. R Rated movies tend not to do as well as lower rated movies, so they made it a PG-13 rated movie and then they packed every celebrity that they could get regardless of whether or not they could find a way for their character to fit in the plot (Which by the way seems like they spent about 10 minutes writing).

In my opinion a comedy is made by unpredictable things happening that doesn't make sense. This totally didn't apply. They went along with the story i.e. ""Signs"", and just made a few Sentences that ""did not really make sense"".

Hopefully they'll learn from their mistake and bring back Shorty and Ray before trying to make another movie. What's even worse is they just ripped the characters out without even trying to explain why they left. The one part with Michael Jackson was slightly funny but the rest was horrid.

I watched this at a friends house, and the day I saw it, I went home and ordered it online. Its just that funny. If you don't like comedies, then why are you even reading this? Scary Movie 3 will live in our hearts and minds for ever... unless Scary Movie 4 is better... then Scary Movie 4 will live in our hearts and minds forever... but for now, its all scary movie 3.",Scary Movie 3
