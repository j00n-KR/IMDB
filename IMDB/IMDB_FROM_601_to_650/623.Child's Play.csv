0,Leofwine_draca,Entertaining remake,6,14 May 2020,"CHILD'S PLAY is another horror remake, but this time the original series was never that great to begin with (and in the UK, more notorious for its link with real-life violence than any real effectiveness). This one's about on par with the original, and is certainly better than the last handful of sequels they've churned out. The updating of the modern technology allows for different kinds of effects and scenarios, and Mark Hamill is an able replacement for Brad Dourif, although of course I'd have preferred Dourif to return. The cast play things out and there's a good amount of humour and bloodshed, and also that '80s throwback angle which is always a nice addition to horror. It's not great, but given the state of modern horror it's entertaining enough.",Child's Play
1,SnoopyStyle,so wrong and so right,7,20 September 2019,"Buddi is a doll produced by the Kaslan Corporation. It's a high-tech companion that can connect to the myriad of Kaslan products. A disgruntled employee turns off all the safeguards in one of the dolls. Karen Barclay (Aubrey Plaza) is a struggling single mom to hearing impaired Andy. She is desperate to get a Buddi and the store cashier takes a damaged returned doll from her workplace. The doll insists on being called Chucky. Detective Mike Norris (Brian Tyree Henry) is the son of the Barclays' neighbor. Chucky, with the bad programming, starts killing and Detective Mike investigates.This is NOT Chucky. This is not the franchise. This is all wrong. The doll is ugly AF. Chucky is a beautiful horror icon. If one overlooks those stuff, this is actually a well-made horror movie. It seems to dabble in some camp but mostly, it's a sincere horror. Before watching it, I had full expectation of an ugly mess. The first visual is the ugly mug of the doll and it seems to be well on its way. Somehow, the camp slowly faded and it gets replaced by a competent effort in all areas. The kids are great rooting interest. Aubrey Plaza is a fine mom with an edge. I am struck by the sense that the movie is in good hands. I have never seen anything from this director but maybe I will keep an eye out for him in the future.",Child's Play
2,claudio_carvalho,Great Update of the Franchise,6,31 December 2019,"The toy Buddi with Artificial Intelligence is the great sensation of the Kaslan Industries. When a programmer is fired by his supervisor in a Vietnam factory, he cancels the security protocols of one toy and then he commits suicide. The mother of the lonely thirteen year-old Andy Barclay (Gabriel Bateman) gives a Buddi to him for his birthday and the toy becomes his best friend. But soon Andy notes that something is wrong with his Buddi and together with his new friends Falyn (Beatrice Kitsos) and Pugg (Ty Consiglio), they try to stop him.""Child's Play"" (2019) is a great update of the franchise. The idea of a toy based on technology and an AI that learns under security protocols is excellent. The creepy film also has a balanced combination of gore, horror and comedy. Even if the viewer is not a fan of remake he or she will certainly like this film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Brinquedo Assassino"" (""Assassin Toy"")",Child's Play
3,nogodnomasters,You're children will always be safe,8,29 June 2019,"This is a reboot of the original series with the main characters having the same name. In the new version, the doll is an electronic product connected to the cloud and other electronic products created by the Kaslan company. The Buddi doll is similar to other electronic home products except it learns and is mobile. A disgruntled employee removes all the safety protocols from the electronic chip which accounts for the doll's behavior after watching a slasher film with a bunch of laughing kids.I liked Aubrey Plaza in this dark comedy. I thought maybe Craig Robinson would have made a better choice for the Detective neighbor. Since Chucky is a mass-produced electronic doll, there is a chance for infinite sequels.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. no nudity.",Child's Play
4,kosmasp,Different but same,7,8 January 2021,"As with the original movie, this again is called Childs play - the Germans back then already named the original ""Chucky"" (the murder doll - they like to describe things, you see?). The poster here is revealing I reckon for those not familiar with the doll or its history. And while they were quite succesful in just putting out sequel after sequel from the original doll and its story, they actually managed to make a more than decent ""revive""/reimagination(?) or whatever it is called these days.Of course it was imperative to have a great voice for the doll - and who better to do that and replace the original actor than Mark Hamill himself. While many may just know him as Luke Skywalker, there are also a lot who know his voice work (especially for animated stuff and even more so for the Joker of Batman fame)! And it is more than important that he is on board here. His voice work is exceptional. The story itself may be predictable, but nonentheless is entertaining, funny and violent when it needs to be. It doesn't take itself serious, has some nuggets for fans of the original and is just fun to watch overall.",Child's Play
5,Sleepin_Dragon,At least they tried.,6,16 April 2020,"I am struggling to understand how this film is causing such heated feelings, reviews of 1 and 10 stars, I cannot recognise either. It's very much a middle of the road film, the acting is decent, production values are half decent, overall it's not bad.If you want scares and originality, then you need to look elsewhere, there aren't any here. In its favour, they took the original concept of the movie and tinkered with it to make it relevant for 2019, society and technology are very different to the time of the original.I'd have liked this when I was about 15, it's silly horror, it has a few laughs, and doesn't take itself seriously at all.It's a film about a killer doll, don't expect Tolstoy.They tried, they did ok, 6/10.",Child's Play
6,jboothmillard,Child's Play,6,6 July 2019,"The original 1988 movie is worth watching, the second is okay, the third is terrible, Bride of Chucky is good fun, Seed of Chucky is alright, Curse of Chucky is good, and Cult of Chucky is reasonable. This new movie served as both a remake and a reboot of the franchise, the big changes being that the doll is not possessed by the soul of a serial killer, it is a toy with advanced AI technology, and no longer called ""Good Guy Doll"", it is ""Buddi"". Basically, the multinational Kaslan Corporation has launched Buddi, a revolutionary line of high-tech dolls, designed to be life-long companions to their owners by learning from their surroundings and acting accordingly, they can also connect to and operate other Kaslan products, and have quickly become a success for children worldwide. At a Buddi assembly factory in Vietnam, an employee is fired by his supervisor for slacking. In retaliation, the employee manipulates the doll that he is assembling by disabling all its safety protocols, before committing suicide. The doll is packed alongside others in preparation for international delivery. In Chicago, retail clerk Karen Barclay (Aubrey Plaza) and her thirteen-year-old hearing-impaired son Andy (Gabriel Bateman) have moved into their new apartment. Karen encourages Andy to make new friends while she works in preparation for his upcoming birthday. To cheer Andy up and assist his unease of the relocation, and the presence of her new boyfriend Shane (David Lewis), Karen blackmails her boss let her take a Buddi doll home. Karen gives the doll to Andy as an early birthday present, he activates the doll, and it gives itself the name Chucky (voiced by Mark Hamill). Over time, Chucky becomes attached to Andy, and helps him to befriend two kids in the same building, Falyn (Beatrice Kitsos) and Pugg (Ty Consiglio). But Chucky begins to display violent tendencies, he strangles the Barclay's pet cat after it scratches Andy. Then one night, Andy and his friends gleefully watch horror movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Chucky starts mimicking the violence on screen, approaching them with a kitchen knife before Andy disarms him. The next day, Andy arrives home to find the cat is dead, Chucky admits murdering it so that it would not hurt him anymore. Karen locks the doll in a closet, but he escapes and terrorises Shane, which leading to Shane confronting Andy. Chucky overhears Andy pleading for Shane to disappear, he follows Shane home, it is revealed Shane is married with children, he has been having an affair with Karen behind his wife's back. Shane goes outside to take down the Christmas light, Chucky frightens him to fall from the ladder and break both of his legs, before killing him with an activated tiller. The following day, Chucky delivers Shane's skinned face covering a watermelon as a gift to a horrified Andy. While police Detective Mike Norris (Brian Tyree Henry) begins an investigation, Andy, Falyn and Pugg decide to disable Chucky and dispose of him in the garbage. Building voyeur and electrician Gabe (Trent Redekop) finds the doll and repairs him, and a fully repaired Chucky tortures and murders Gabe with a table saw. Chucky makes his way back upstairs, and lands in the possession of Omar (Marlon Kazadi), another kid in the building. Chucky observes Mike's mother Doreen (Carlease Burke) saying to Andy about being a ""new best friend"", so he proceeds to kill her in a controlled car crash. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that Chucky has become murderous, she takes Andy with her to the shopping mall workplace in order to keep him nearby. Suspecting that Andy is the killer, Mike travels to the mall and apprehends him just as Chucky uses his control of Kaslan technology to take control of the building. Chaos is unleashed as several employees and customers are brutally killed by rampaging Buddi dolls and other hacked toys, while Chucky triggers the mall to go into lockdown. Mike is wounded during the massacre, Andy and his friends manage to reach the exit, but Andy is forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage with intent to kill her. Andy manages to free his mother and stop her being hanged, while being attacked by Chucky, before overpowering and defeating the doll with help from Karen and Mike. While paramedics tend Karen, Mike and other survivors, Andy and the rest of his friends destroy Chucky's lifeless body in a nearby alleyway. In the aftermath of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan Corporation CEO Henry Kaslan (Tim Matheson) issues a statement regarding Chucky's programming, many Buddi dolls are recalled and placed into storage, one is seen to be malfunctioning inside its box, implying that Chucky may have uploaded his consciousness into another body. Also starring Nicole Anthony as Detective Willis. So Chucky is essentially like an upgraded Alexa device (or Furby lol) gone wrong, a high-tech toy with its inhibitors turned off, rejects its programming, becomes self-aware, and goes on a killing spree (like a toy version of Terminator lol), this new concept of the toy being defective and going wrong is interesting for the modern era, and breathes a new kind of life into the series for the new generation. Hamill (replacing Brad Dourif) brings his own kind of sinister tones to the voice of the killer doll, the special effects are well assembled, and there are enough over-the-top gory deaths to keep the pace up, it is a bit up and down at times, but it is darker, creepier, and has its own kind of novelty value, I wouldn't be surprised if it spawns a sequel, a worthwhile horror. Good!",Child's Play
7,BA_Harrison,Give it a chance.,8,21 September 2019,"Having seen the poor design for Chucky '19, and on hearing that serial killer Charles Lee Ray would play no part in the story, I had no real burning desire to see this remake of cult favourite Child's Play, but ultimately felt that I should give the film a fair chance to challenge my preconceptions. And challenge them it most certainly did!I went into the film cringing at the sight of the new Buddi toy doll that replaces the Good Guys from the original, but came out of the film having enjoyed myself a lot more than I thought I would. The look of the doll definitely takes a bit of getting used to, but the whole 'messed up AI.' plot device actually worked pretty well, and the film succeeds by being knowingly silly at times and more than a bit demented, with some surprisingly nasty moments.Gabriel Bateman plays 13-year-old Andy, whose single mother Karen (Aubrey Plaza) gets her hands on a high-tech Buddi doll for her son's birthday. Unfortunately, this particular doll has a fault: a disgruntled factory worker in the manufacturing plant removed the safety protocols, making it capable of learning and extreme violence. Keen to please it's new owner, Chucky, as the doll names itself, goes about getting rid of anyone who upsets Andy.So what makes this remake so much fun? Well, there's the willingness to get dark and bloody when necessary. Chucky is a vicious little thing, strangling the family cat after it scratches Andy, and picking up a few sick tricks from Leatherface after Andy and his friends watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (out of sequence). A lot of blood gets spilt, with one hilarious scene seeing a little girl getting drenched in blood after a guy is stabbed in the neck. Another victim is dropped onto a rotary table saw (nasty!), killer drones attack people in a department store, while the newest toy in the Buddi line-the Buddi Bear-is truly the stuff of nightmares, especially when it comes to life to kill!Also going a long way to making this film so entertaining: Mark Hamill, as the voice of Chucky, the actor a more than respectable successor to Brad Dourif. Hamill's voice is suitably creepy, but he also manages to make Chucky quite sympathetic at times; after all, he only wants to make Andy happy and be his best friend forever.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Child's Play
8,paul_haakonsen,No. Just no...,3,10 September 2019,"Right, well if you ever have seen any of the old ""Child's Play"" movies where it is Brad Dourif voicing the Chucky doll, then you might want to do yourself a favor and give this abysmal 2019 reboot (or remake, whatever Hollywood wants to call it) a wide berth.This 2019 movie was every bit as horrible as I had expected and anticipated it to be. I mean, you don't go back and meddle with the classics; just look at what happened with ""IT"", ""Pet Sematary"" and ""Poltergeist"" to mention but a few of classic horror movies that were wronged horribly by Hollywood's quest to revisit things that worked and try to make it better.Can't really say that director Lars Klevberg did anything particularly great here with the script and storyline as written by Tyler Burton Smith.Sure, most of us are already well familiar with the story and legacy of Charles Lee Ray and Chucky, which just makes this 2019 remake such an unnecessary movie. And it didn't help much that the movie was unfathomably generic and horribly scripted. Actually, for a seasoned horror veteran as myself and having grown up with the ""Child's Play"" movies from the very first, then this 2019 was a slap to the face with a cold, dead fish.Sure, they changed the script and storyline and Charles Lee Ray is not even a part of the storyline in this ghastly remake. And the changes weren't really all that good.And what is up with the appearance of Chucky in this 2019 version? He doesn't even look nearly as off or disturbing as he did in the old movies. In fact, there is just something way too cartoonish about the way he looks now and it doesn't suit the Chucky character one bit.Now, what does work for the movie is the fact that they have Mark Hamill voicing Chucky. But while Mark Hamill does indeed have a very characteristic voice and I have been a fan of him since ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"", then he is by no means no Brad Dourif. Not even close.I am sure that this 2019 ""Child's Play"" movie will find a niche with younger viewers whom might never have seen or even heard of the old classics. But for us whom have and do like the classics, this was just a train wreck.",Child's Play
9,BandSAboutMovies,Surprisingly...weird,5,4 August 2019,"This is the first Child's Play movie made without the involvement of creator Don Mancini and actor Brad Dourif. Instead, Lars Klevberg (whose film Polaroid has been lost in the legislative downfall of the Weinsteins) directed from a script by Tyler Burton Smith (who wrote the video games Sleeping Dogs and Quantum Break).Mancini has criticized the remake while understanding that rights holder Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer can do anything they want. When asked if he and fellow producer David Kirschner would be involved, he said, ""We said no thank you, because we have our ongoing thriving business with Chucky. Obviously, my feelings were hurt... And I did create the character and nurture the franchise for three decades. So when someone says, ""Oh yeah, we would love to have your name on the film,"" it was hard not to feel like I was being patronized. They just wanted our approval. Which I strenuously denied them.""Instead of the supernatural origins of the past, this Chucky is a Buddi doll created by the Kaslan Corporation. This kind of tears out the most frightening part of the Chucky concept - a doll that somehow comes to life yet is consumed by pure evil.The real problem starts in a foreign Buddi assembly factory, where an employee takes out all of the safety protocols before killing himself. That doll eventually makes its way to the home of Karen Barclay (Aubrey Plaza) and her hearing impaired son Andy (Gabriel Bateman, who was also in Annabelle and Lights Out).While Andy eventually gains real human friends, Chucky places his friend's happiness above all common sense and restraint. Unlike the past, where Chucky is motivated only by his own concerns, here you can see how his lack of human understanding leads to all of the murder and mayhem. He doesn't realize how a movie that the kids watch, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, can provide laughter and pleasure while real death leads to life-changing results.This Chucky also has the ability to command phones, household objects, drones and cars, as well as command an army of the next line of Buddi dolls on the night they are introduced, which includes a positively harrowing bear version.I was totally prepared to absolutely despise this film until I saw it in a new light. I wondered, what if Claudio Fragrasso somehow got his hands on the chance to make Child's Play? The results wouldn't be all that great, but they'd sure be fun. That's what this movie aspires to. It's certainly entertaining - any movie where the adulturous villain is scalped by a tiller in a watermelon patch while taking down Christmas lights and his face is skinned off and passed around as a gift or a child is sprayed right in the face by a store manager's blood is going to be a winner in my book. But it could have been a totally different film with a totally different title and lead character without changing the story all that much.But hey - Mark Hamill is awesome as the voice of Chucky and Tim Matheson shows up as Henry Kaslan, the head of Kaslan Industries. I laughed out loud a few times. And I'm not as married to Chucky as a slasher hero as I am to Michael Myers, Jason, Freddy, Leatherface or anyone else. And let's face - all of those characters have had some pretty bad movies in their history, too. This one isn't as bad as any of those. Sure, Chucky looks like unfinished CGI, but you can't have everything.",Child's Play

The defect doll is given to a young fellow named Andy (Gabriel Bateman) , who renames the doll Chucky.

11,view_and_review,A.I. Chucky,5,2 July 2019,"Chucky is back in a new way. Instead of being possessed by the soul of Charles Lee Ray, Chucky is now more in line with the 21st century. He's a smart doll with the ability to wirelessly connect and control other smart devices--except, this Buddy Doll has been intentionally misprogrammed. This is a classic Black Mirror episode.This Child's Play doesn't have the appeal of Child's Play 1988. To begin with, the doll doesn't look very friendly. The original Chucky looked very benign and kid-friendly right out of the box. It wasn't until Charles Lee Ray's soul began taking over that the Good Guy Doll began to look more sinister. In this movie, the Chucky doll looks mean from the beginning.Then, the characters slated for killing were so obvious. It was almost like they wanted to make sure we were OK with the characters being killed. Except for a few wild cards in there the main deaths were clear cut unlikeable creatures.The only plus the 2019 Child's Play has over the 1988 version is the gore-if you're looking for that. This Chucky was much more sadistic.That wasn't enough for me though. It was essentially malevolent A.I. which has been explored so much already.But, for those who are counting, there was a girl power moment in the movie. So, if that gets your patronage, then there is one more plus if you like.Overall, this Child's Play didn't tickle my fancy. Maybe I'm just old fashioned but I want my mean, serial killer doll, with a nefarious sounding voice.",Child's Play
12,neil-476,Missed opportunities,7,25 June 2019,"When a disgruntled employee removes the safety protocols from the AI chip in a Buddi doll (renamed Chucky by young hard-of-hearing owner Andy), the doll starts exhibiting antisocial behaviour.This updated take on the murderous doll franchise from the 70s and 80s starts from an encouraging point - corrupted AI rather than supernatural intervention. And it canters along satisfactorily enough, with some moderate slaughter, some tension, and decent performances from Aubrey Plaza in a completely straight dramatic performances in a mainstream film - who knew - and Mark Hamill, riffing on his Joker while providing Chucky's voice.Sadly, there are some missed opportunities. Andy's hearing aid appears to have no relevance whatsoever despite hetting some meaningful close-ups. And the fact that Chucky is tapped into the Cloud and, therefore, other domestic devices, could have been used to much greater effect.But it's OK and will, no doubt, generate a sequel.",Child's Play
13,Wizard-8,Neither great nor terrible,5,12 October 2019,"I originally didn't plan to see this remake, until I got wind that it seemed to be a movie that sharply divided viewers - people either seemed to love it a lot, or hate it a lot. That got me really curious, and I wondered whether I would enjoy or loathe it.Actually, I thought that the movie fell somewhere in the middle.There are some positive things to be found here. First, unlike many remakes, this one just takes the basic premise and does its own thing with it instead of being a scene by scene retelling. Also, I found it interesting that while the original movie was a (mostly) straight horror movie, this remake instead leans more to being a comedy, albeit one with a lot of dark moments. I admit that I did find some of the humor to be amusing. Other things I liked about the movie were some decent performances by a largely no-name cast, as well as there not being any dull patches.Unfortunately, while the movie is never boring, it all the same does follow a pretty predictable plot pattern - you'll be more or less able to predict what is to come before it actually unfolds. The characters also act in a familiar manner at times. Also, while the movie was a major studio production, it often feels somewhat cheap and slapdash, probably a consequence of the somewhat low budget ($10 million, according to reports).In conclusion, I can say that while I don't really regret watching this remake - it passed the time painlessly enough - I do see that it really wasn't exceptional enough for my time. I would say it's probably best to stick with the original movie instead of this remake.",Child's Play
14,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly enjoyable and entertaining remake,9,29 December 2019,"Trying to please her distraught son, a woman decides to bring home a defective automated doll for his birthday, but after getting it set up realize the doll really was malfunctioned and is set upon killing those who try to interfere in his life, forcing him to try to deal with the doll before it kills him.As a stand-alone entry, there's quite a lot to like here. One of the biggest attributes to this one is the updated accommodations to the story that takes place in the modern-day. By giving us enough information early on to show that the home-security set up to allow the doll a later setup where it runs wild on the technology around him, this one does a great job at showing the potential for it to go wrong simply by virtue of following the instructions given literally. That the doll takes the instructions to be his only friend as an excuse to kill everyone and everything around him makes for a strong indictment against the use of killer technology in today's society, especially when it gets to the craziness of its finale. Showing the wildness of the doll switching on the various devices in the store because it can and causing a massive assault on the clueless shoppers solely because of the ability to do so, this one creates a standout action scene to bring this aspect to life. This one also manages quite a lot to like about the gradual turns towards killing. From the first moments the kids realize the doll is off and able to do unconventional actions, they set it up to freak out the boyfriend in several enjoyable scenes before realizing that it's also going after the cat. That leads to its brutal murder followed by even more deaths around them where they realize what's going on with the dolls' homicidal tendencies targeting everyone to tends to inadvertently threaten him or mention being a friend of his. These are where the film shines as the scenes of the doll attacking at the boyfriends' house, the stalking around the friends' house when he's trying to be with the other group of friends or the amazing scene stalking the elderly neighbor in the self-driven car that ends with some stellar action and stunt work. All combined together with the impressive effects work on the doll to make it come to life, this combines into a great central killer and really holds this one up overall. There are a few minor issues to be had here. The biggest problem here is the film's incredibly hamfisted manner in which the corrupt doll gets on the market and into the hands of the family which seems pure contrivance. The worker corrupting the dolls' software is completely underwhelming with no motivation or build-up to doing so and the fallout of the incident at the plant would've brought more scrutiny than it does. That also plays out in the murders where the police are continually finding bodies that couldn't possibly be done by the kid yet nothing is done by that, much like the lack of understanding what happened to the various kills like the building handyman or the neighbor which was an incident witnessed by dozens of people to provide enough of a counterpoint to their fleeting conclusions. As it is, this one tends to be quite easy to spot contrivance to let the story unfold when it didn't need to be, which is the main issue that holds this one back.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, violence-against-animals and children-in-jeopardy.",Child's Play
15,trashgang,better than expected,7,20 September 2019,"Off we go for another reboot of classic horror flick. This time they were smart enough to place it in our time era and not just back in the eighties, which means, the doll has a cloud and an app. Great for the newcomers in the genre to watch this.The only reference towards the original one is that the doll chooses it's own name due a fault in it's system, from Buddi it changes into Chucky. Once he's Chucky things go slowly wrong.Not bad after all and it do has it moments with the doll's scary eyes and some bloody scene's too. Naturally it do involves a lot of kids due the succes of Stranger Things so teens could watch it too. So I was rather surprised that for a reboot it was above mediocre.

16,blanbrn,A pretty decent remake and now it's a high tech Chucky!,8,24 June 2019,"Growing up as a kid still young in 1988 I remember seeing ""Child's Play"" and it became a horror classic that would span several sequels. Now in 2019 it was time for an update and new take on it. Still the little doll has the same bad nature as he toys with the lives of all of those around him bringing death and pain. Set in a big city a divorced sexy bed hopping sexy colored bra wearing mom named Karen(Aubrey Plaza who also has a damsel in distress scene in which she's tied up and has her mouth duct taped!) buys her 13 year old son Andy(Gabriel Bateman) a birthday present and then plenty of bad nature starts. This little red headed buddy is not who he seems as ""Chucky"" wrecks havoc upon those in his path. The film is blended with themes of the high tech world as this doll is controlled by apps that include the use of a cell phone, and it's programmed and wired for wi-fi use as this doll comes with a planted computer chip! Overall well done update of a horror classic as it tied in with the current times of 2019 more and it's a must see for horror or ""Child's Play"" fans. Also a note Mark Hamill is the voice of Chucky.",Child's Play
17,thesar-2,"Sorry, Jack, Chucky's BACK Again",9,19 July 2020,"OMG. How could this possibly be my (now) 3rd favorite in the entire series? And I vowed never to see it!I'm not opposed to remakes. Granted only 10-20% are good, but those few are usually so good, it's nice to have new, updated versions to compliment the older ones I loved so much. But, I WAS opposed to this movie; from the get-go.These were my thoughts immediately as the announcement was made and I saw the trailer:#1 The new Chucky looked so fake and funny looking, I didn't think I'd ever see him as scary and, instead, unintentionally hilarious.
#2 Gone was the awesome backstory of the serial killer transposed into the eventual killer doll.
#3 Andy was way to old to play with dolls and his mum too young to have had him.
And so on and so on. So, I vowed never to see this. I even watched spoiler-heavy reviews on YouTube since I never thought I'd see this.But, then today, Facebook told me it was readily available on Amazon Prime, of which I have a subscription. I thought, okay, FREE and I love so-bad, it's-good movies. ONLY because it's free am I giving it a shot.30 seconds in, my jaw dropped on how awful the updated Chucky doll looked. And my mouth was agape for some time following, especially with the reason given to why this doll would be evil. But, then, everything changed. Also, my mouth finally closed. I'm not a mouth-breather, for heaven's sake!I found myself enjoying the movie. I laughed at the jokes, I marveled at the way they knew their shortcomings (such as the aforementioned age difference from Mom to Son, and that he doesn't play with dolls and why Chucky's relevant) and winked at the audience, how much I ALWAYS love Aubrey Plaza and the updated story was actually rather touching...and relevant.To make up for a supposedly unexpected move, Mom gives her son, Andy, an A.I. refurbished ""Buddi"" doll since he has no friends and is depressed about their new surroundings. At first, Andy is creeped out from (haha, I LOVE how his name became) Chucky, but soon, they bond and there's actual, genuine chemistry from the actor to animatronic toy.But, slowly and surely, they remind us: this IS a horror movie and Chucky becomes more obsessed with Andy and his needs and takes out anyone or thing standing in the way of Andy's happiness. Who will believe Andy when bad things happen and not only he's not to blame, but a doll is?Okay, again, I was against this whole idea from the start. As much as I really dug Rob Zombie's Halloween (JUST part 1, his H2 can go straight to hell) and 2009's Friday the 13th, I was still against this ""abomination."" I really thought I'd hate this and after a third of the movie was over, I was like: Okay, I *just* liked the first 30 minutes. Here comes the rest of the crap.Nope. This movie never let me down. Now, it's not perfect, and a few scenes don't work, i.e. Chucky can apparently teleport like the previously mentioned Friday the 13th killer, Jason, but overall, I couldn't help but be amazed on how much I LOVED this update.I would say you absolutely need to know: this isn't the original Child's Play all over again. This is like 8% of that idea and 92% fresh and inventive concepts that fit this modern age. I appreciate that. So just know that going in.I do hate that I had such negative thoughts prior to seeing it and that might have been why I enjoyed this so much. For, when you start at the very bottom, the only way to go is up. BUT...no. It's actually not that at all. I am fully honest with how much I loved this. Start to finish. And what a grand finale it had.I'll always have a special place in my Horror-Lovin' heart for Brad Dourif's Chucky. His voice is just as synonymous with Chucky as James Earl Jones is with Darth Vader. I even met him and the real Andy - though he thought I stalked him at the convention. Twice (a second convention.) Neither true, long story. Lol. And, frankly and sorry, animated Joker fans, Mark Hamill didn't come close to matching the creepy and iconic Dourif voice. But he did well enough with the new incarnation of Chucky.I implore you: You MUST see this movie. Fan of the original, hate the original series, or indifferent, this is a great add-on, or even stand-alone horror feature.***Final thoughts: Off the top of my head, here's my list of the Child's Play series ranked, best to worst:
1 Child's Play (1988)
2 Bride of Chucky
3 Child's Play (2019)
4 Curse of Chucky
5 Child's Play 2
6 Cult of Chucky
7 Child's Play 3

19,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Just another soulless remake of an 80s classic,2,23 April 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningTeenager Andy (Gabriel Bateman) receives a 'Buddi' doll for his birthday off his mom (Zahra Anderson.) Unbeknownst to either of them, however, the doll is programmed to replicate human behaviour (or something!) and develops the power to behave homicidally. Developing an overbearing attachment to Andy, Buddi enacts his own version of justice on Andy's abusive stepdad Henry (Tim Matheson) and the kids who don't accept him, leading to an apocalyptic finale.An oft trotted out justification for this modern trend of 'reboots' of classic films from the 80s is the need to 'reimagine' them, and put a modern day spin on the film that went before. And so director Lars Klevberg has presented us with a 2019 version of the 1988 classic Child's Play, involving camera phones, the internet and all the other trappings of the present day. And in so doing, has presented us with a soulless, stupid film that no amount of open mindedness and 'not expecting it to be as good as the original' can overcome.It's biggest mistake is completely underestimating everything that made the original work so well. The innocence and naievaty of the six year old Andy made him more believable, and the there was some genuine mystery as to whether he really was a disturbed child, or the Chucky doll was really alive. Here, Andy is just a typically bratty, spoiled teen, and its hard to see what appeal a doll like that would even have to a kid of that age. Instead of appearing scary in any way, everything about Buddi is laughable, most notably his annoying signature singing tune (""you are my buddy, my only friend...you are my buddy...until the end"") that even plays over the bloody end credits. In the original, we knew Chucky was possessed by the soul of a serial killer (even though none of the characters did) so he could manipulate a young child to do his bidding, but there doesn't seem to be any discernible reason for this evil doll to be doing what it's doing.The deaths in the original were short, swift and brutal, but in this nonsensical remake, they're overly laborious and ridiculously dragged out (to wit, the death of a central character involving Christmas lights and a lawnmower, whereas before simply knocking a character out a top storey window would suffice.) There was a touch of light humour here and there in the original, but here Klevberg seems to be trying to make it central to the script, awkwardly inserting it in during dramatic interludes in the film where it really has no place. Nobody talks, or acts, like a normal person would, given who they are or their situation, and its testament to how stupid and carelessly written the script is that it's like this.If there was any doubt to the classical status of the original, this soulless, laughable remake is definitely it, one I'm glad I effectively saw for free on Netflix, and one I regret giving the benefit of the doubt to. *",Child's Play
20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Possibly the best remake to date.,8,23 June 2019,"By making fundamental changes to its source material and having them be absolutely vital to its story, 'Child's Play (2019)' stands on its own as a piece of rounded, relevant filmmaking that doesn't even try to replace original. Instead, it can stand side by side with, inspired by but separate from, its 1988 predecessor. This is something that most remakes can only dream of doing and it puts it much closer to something like 'The Fly (1986)' or 'The Thing (1982)' than something like 'RoboCop (2014)' or 'Total Recall (2012)'. The big change it makes is, of course, swapping serial killer for Siri, so to speak. Not only does this differentiate the piece, it also modernises it; much of what happens doesn't seem all that far-fetched, even if it is (ala 'Black Mirror (2014-)'. Personally, I feel as though it makes for a more interesting and thematically rich experience. Chucky is presented, ostensibly, as a child, one who just wants to play with his best pal and uses what he learns throughout the film to do so. His safety measures are disabled, which is why the AI-driven doll is able to eventually hurt people. The easy joke would be to compare the whole thing to that 'Child's Play (1988)'-spoofing 'Treehouse of Horror' episode of 'The Simpsons (1989-)', wherein the 'possessed' Krusty doll is actually just set to ""kill"", but the reality of the film is much more complex than that. Chucky isn't evil, he's just confused. Everything he does in the latter half, when the bodies inevitably begin to pile up, is driven by his desire to both protect and play with Andy. It's also all established earlier during scenes that demonstrate how seemingly harmless events can be misconstrued by his naïve operating system (seeing his friends laugh at the gruesome sequences in 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)' doesn't do a lot to distance violence from fun in his mind, for example). As you can tell, Chucky is very much a character, despite - essentially - being an appliance. His relationship to Andy is decently explored, too; it isn't as 'black and white' as you might expect. This makes for an intriguing and entertaining story. It has an underlying theme and its screenplay does the necessary work to make it constantly feel character-focused, logical and satisfying. However, there are some moments of almost 'splat-stick' comedy that don't quite land - though, they may provoke a bemused chuckle - and it adheres to quite a few tropes, a couple of which are somewhat tiresome (if at home). The humour is usually used to solidify the core players as 'real people' within the picture's world. Plus, the clichés aren't generally detrimental because they're used to good effect; the piece feels very much like a modern-day '80s film'. It's pacy, well-written and entertaining. It's never scary, per se, but there are some great, somewhat tense set-pieces and the doll is nicely practical for the majority of the run-time. The retro-inspired soundtrack is fantastic, too. Overall, it's a fun, compelling and thematically complete experience that may just be the best remake of recent years. 8/10",Child's Play
21,bowmanblue,A reboot done right,8,29 May 2020,"Has Hollywood completely run out of ideas? The correct answer is 'Yes.' Reboots, remakes and reimaginings are all the rage right now - and none more so prominent than in the horror genre. Therefore, it was only a matter of time before the nineteen eighties classic 'Child's Play' was given the same lazy treatment. I didn't bother watching it in the cinema as I was all set to sneer at it as merely a shameless cash grab and a cheap, knock-off of the original. How wrong I was.Okay, so it is probably a bit of a 'cash grab,' but in the depressing history of horror remakes, this is actually a pretty good one. For a start, they take the initial idea, i.e. child's toy doll that comes to life and starts killing people and change enough to make it recognisable as 'Child's Play,' while at the same time changing enough (mainly bringing it screaming into the modern era with our society's obsession with 'smart homes/devices') to make it different to the original.If you're worried that the child actors will spoil the film (as they often do - and not just in horror films) then don't worry. They're actually quite good and believable in their roles. Obviously, the 'real' star of the film is the doll himself, or, in this case we have Mark Hamill stepping in for the original's Brad Dourif. And, besides being known best for Luke Skywalker, he's actually really good at doing creepy voice work (as anyone who's seen his cartoon portrayal as 'the Joker' in the animated
'Batman' series can vouch for.I'd probably say the original 'Child's Play' film was an outright horror (whereas its sequels fell into more a 'horror/comedy' feel) whereas this remake has definitely more than a few moments of black humour thrown in there, so prepare to have at least a little chuckle here and there. Especially as the film's real high-point is actually its script. All the way through it felt fresh and fun (in a dark and murderous kind of way, obviously!) and the characters interacted with each other in a way that felt natural.Okay, so it may never have the originality of the original - by the very nature that it's a remake, but don't just dismiss it because it's a copy. It may not be part of the existing 'Child's Play' 'lore,' but it's a smart and funny horror film that definitely deserves a watch (and I think Mark Hamill really sounded like he was enjoying himself singing the 'Buddi song').",Child's Play
22,ThomasDrufke,A Reimagining of the Cult Classic,6,22 July 2019,"For someone who has never seen a 'Chucky' movie nor has ever cared to look into any of the mythology, I thought the 2019 reboot may be a good start. To my pleasant surprise, it wasn't all that bad. The way they integrated technology into 'Chucky's' arc and quite frankly, most of his kills, felt inventive and only somewhat unrealistic. But I suppose suspending your disbelief is something you have to do when entering into a theater showing a movie about a doll who murders people who harm his 'Andy'. Far from the visceral thrills of It or something like The Conjuring, but loads better than a film like Winchester, Child's Play is a solid entry into a franchise that has likely seen better days. Here's hoping the rest of 2019 can keep the horror hot streak going.6.8/10",Child's Play

But more than that it's the simple lack of horror and the doll's awkward appearance that plays spoilsport with this more of a slasher film. What I did like, however, is the representation of how artificial intelligence can wreak havoc by taking over our lives. Now that's a theme I like but for all the other reasons there's no way I am going to be stoked about a Child's Play 2 reboot.",Child's Play
26,jacobjohntaylor1,Better then Cult of Chucky,10,2 October 2019,This is a great horror movie. It has a great story line. It has great acting. It is better the Cult of Chucky. The original Child's play from 1988 is better. Child's play 2 is also better. Child's play 3 is also better.,Child's Play
27,UniqueParticle,On par if not almost as good as the original,9,26 June 2019,"Quite a nice advanced take on the sinister story with a new Andy and Chucky, I loved how futuristic this is and Aubrey Plaza is decent in horror she should do it more. Also some girl in the audience was smiling several times, I relate to that and makes me wish I had a girlfriend, just saying, it was cute! Anyway though ""Friends till the end"" in the most evil way possible, I don't like to spoil anything most times but this has awesome kills in it that are gory, I enjoy that in a slasher. Mark Hamill is such a great actor, holy crap he nailed this!",Child's Play
28,paulclaassen,"Not all (that) bad, but rather watch the original...",5,16 September 2019,"This remake has been cleverly updated to include today's technology, apps and gadgets. However, with Andy now 13 years old and with all the technology, the innocence of the original film is lost. It is still not entirely believable for a 13-year old boy with mobile technology to be interested in a doll. (In the original film it completely made sense for a 6-year old Andy to be playing with dolls).The opening scene and the reason for Chucky becoming a killer doll isn't nearly as impressive as the original. In the 1988 film, a ruthless killer transfers his soul into the doll just before dying, whereas in this remake, the doll simply malfunctions due to programming errors. Chucky - nor the film - is therefore as sinister as the original 'Child's Play'.As for the acting and characters, the only characters that really stand out, is Andy and his mother (played by Gabriel Bateman Audrey Plaza). The rest of the characters are disposable, especially the Detective, who is a comic relief character who adds nothing to the film. (The detective in the 1988 film played a huge role in the film, and was so well portrayed by Chris Sarandon). The rest of the characters are silly with silly dialogue, and very little substance. Although I miss Brad Douriff voicing Chucky, Mark Hamill really did a very good job, as well. As for the new design Chucky, I don't like this doll at all!I wonder what my opinion of the film would have been if I haven't seen the original film and had nothing to compare it to. Even so, the film has way too many credibility issues. Credit where credit is due, though, the killing scenes are very well made, cringe worthy and brutal.In general this wasn't all that bad a film, but I'd much rather watch the original ten times over before watching this again...",Child's Play
29,cruise01,"Bloody, slashing, and delivering a decent reboot to the franchise.",6,23 June 2019,"Child's Play (3 out of 5 stars).Child's Play is a reboot/remake to the original film that had Brad Douriff voicing the friendly buddy doll named Chucky. As a deranged psycho killer he had some spell to transfer his spirit into the doll to escape the police. And a boy named Andy gets the doll and the doll becomes alive and goes on a killing spree. This reboot plays the similar story while the script and direction does add some new spin on the concept. Modernizing the idea of technology and network. A company making those buddi dolls that can link to the network and do about everything that is connected to the network such as controlling the room temperature, turning nearby technology like tvs, computers, smart phones, and adapting to every thing nearby. Lets not forget the self driving cars is one of them. The company that is making the buddi dolls is using some self aware programming chip to make these dolls alive. While, one of the buddi dolls chip is tampered with the programming. It gets shipped off. And a loner teenager Andy (Gabriel Bateman) gets buddi as a gift from his hard working mother Karen (Aubrey Plaza). As buddi is turned alive and the malfunctioning doll becomes aware. It goes on a killing spree.First off, I am a huge fan of the original first few Child's Play films. I found the original doll and Brad Douriff's voice to be creepy. Before the films went downhill and became more comedic. This reboot does bring back a little 1980s gorefest and kills. It delivers some thrills and suspense. And every now and then add a bit of humor. When Buddi becomes aware of and starts picking people off. The kills can be a bit gory. And Mark Hamill's voice as Buddi is a bit creepy. Buddi is like a learning system that learns what it sees and becomes unaware of what is right and wrong. After seeing Andy and his friends enjoying watching a horror movie on tv like Texas Chainsaw. Buddi sees that they enjoy that type of nature involving violence. When the deaths starts rising, Andy is having trouble with people believing him like his mother. And his neighbor cop Mike (Brian Tyree Henry). The film does have a bit of a blood bath climax taking place in a store with the release of Buddi 2's and Chucky takes control of the store as his own playground.I did not like Chucky's design on the doll as much. It is not as scary as the original Child's Play movie with the design and voice. This reboot does modernize it and ground the concept a little bit. With having Chucky program device go haywire into a killing doll. The new design is creepy and cheesy but it was difficult getting used to the new look.Overall, Child's Play is a fair film. It delivers on the suspense and thrills. It does have that 1980s gory horror movie feel with the kills. The cast did okay with their roles and Mark Hamill's voice is a bit creepy. It is definitely better than the recent Chucky movies but not as good as the original film.",Child's Play
30,TheMovieDiorama,Child's Play entertainingly catapults a mechanical Chucky to the Internet era.,6,27 June 2019,"As with most modern unnecessary remakes of classic horror slashers (and trust me, there are far too many of them), I sat down in my seat with the lowest of expectations. Why remake something if decisions aren't put in place to change the story? Well, the silly fool that I am was proved wrong. This rebooted interpretation of Holland's original takes Chucky down a surprisingly interesting direction that seems more apt than ever before. A high-tech doll has its safety features removed, consequently making it susceptible to violence. But when a mother chooses to gift this malfunctioned doll to her son, well, better hide the kitchen knives!The best way to modernise a story, is to use the advanced technology that surrounds us hard-working humans everyday. Cloud technology, robotics, smartphones, artificial intelligence and the uprising of self-driving vehicles. Chucky, now immersed in this environment, is a product of its external factors. The whole ""serial killer transferring his soul via voodoo magic"" nonsense is old news. And despite having that B-movie charm, it wouldn't have been effective if released today. This was the only, and most logical, route to go down and shockingly it made for an enjoyable slasher. A doll designed to be a guardian angle figure, now gone psychotic due to the excessive violence that is depicted through several art forms (film, gaming etc.). Satirising the digital era and ""millennial"" behaviour, even though these kids aren't exactly millennials.Regardless, it worked for me. Sure the tone is occasionally inconsistent to begin with, and Klevberg certainly takes his time in letting Chucky inventively kill those that will get in the way of its friendship with Andy. But once Chucky claims its first victim, the fun rarely ceases.The biggest upset, apparently, is with Chucky's design. It definitely is a sight to behold, but once you get passed the initial ""what the hell is that thing"" the design grows on you. Like a friend. A best friend. ""You are my buuuuuddyyyy""! What helps is Hamill's stellar voice acting, ranging from sweet and innocent to creepy and sinister. However, Dourif's relentless wave of expletives was sorely missed, which did give Chucky a huge dosage of personality. The animatronics were decent, not as revolutionary or inventive, although the moments of CGI were far too noticeable and took me straight out of the film. Glitches and all. This was apparent during the anticlimactic final showdown which felt ridiculously rushed and messy.In terms of human characters, Bateman gave an excellent performance and held the film together. Plaza on the other hand, was drastically underused. Some comedic moments from her would've been appreciated. Oh, I will say there is a scene involving a wrapped up ""watermelon"" that had me on the edge of my seat, as if it was Christmas. Will they open it? Won't they? Good lord I can't look!Overall, whilst not surpassing the original in terms of memorability, this remake certainly had more context and believability to it that programmatically suited my tastes. The first and last ten minutes should've been tidier, but t'was an enjoyable time nonetheless. Would I want my own Buddi? No. I'll pass on the whole robot ""Skynet"" apocalypse scenario...",Child's Play
31,pmtelefon,Solid remake.,8,30 June 2019,"Some moviegoers get uptight when it comes to making remakes of ""classics"". I enjoyed the original ""Child's Play"" and most of its sequels. But I wouldn't call any of them classics. They are not sacred ground. Chucky went down the same road as Freddy Krueger. His movies became horror/comedy instead of straight horror. The new ""Child's Play"" is a meat and potatoes horror movie. It has plenty of scares and a nice creepy vibe. It's well acted and doesn't overstay its welcome. I liked it.",Child's Play

Aft enjoying the last two parts, I was a bit disappointed when I heard that its gonna be a reboot.
Felt even more disheartened knowing that Mancini, Dourif, Kirschner n Universal studios were not associated with this one.
Anyways this one ain't bad but the dark atmosphere is missing and the doll's design ain't that creepy.
Compared to the last two parts, this one ain't that brutal or darker.
The doll's eyebrows r totally weird n badly done.
Coming back to the film, this time they removed the mumbo jumbo stuff n replaced it with an artificial intelligence doll gone haywired.
This time too, a single mother gets hold of a defected doll which she gives it to her son.
So in this reboot the dolls gets possessive about the boy n aft watching a horror film, it starts mimicking the violence.

It's a unique reboot of the original series, bringing Chucky into the modern age, while showcasing solid pathos & some great deaths. With a brutal use of actual technology as a means of terror, it's a solid tonal combination of the scares in the '87 original & just enough of the knowing silliness of the later entries.

We then cut to a young woman and her son Andy who live in a apartment. Since the young woman works at a department store she keeps a discontinued Buddi doll (calling himself Chucky voiced this time by Mark Hamill from Star Wars) who turns out to be the doll that was created by an ex employee as mentioned before. Will Chucky go on a killing spree and kill those that harm his new friend Andy?This one is different to the 1988 one as in the original one it was a serial killer who transfers his soul into a Good Boy toy,in this one its a self destructive chip that's implanted on the doll and turns evil.If you like the 1988 one watch that instead.",Child's Play
36,subxerogravity,Not a bad remake,7,25 June 2019,"Can't use the word brilliant, but 2019's version of the 1990 slasher goes the obvious direction of changing the mystic origins of chucky to a more technically one, one that kinda makes sense if you ever got a defective iPhone or PlayStation or something.
It's funny how this chucky persnafied all parents fears on what would happen if you exposed your 8 year old to horror movies.
The remake keeps up with the fact that chucky has become this satire. It's just as funny as it is creepy making fun of itself equally as it disturbed the audience.
Nothing says this more than the fact that no kid in his right mind would even want a doll that purposely looks as creepy as the one they made for this remake, espeally one voice by Mark Hamill.
And shout out to Aubrey Plaza who plays a hot mom who hates her job. It really added some meat to what could have been a Dull plot.
It's not trying to be better than the original. It's just trying to squeeze another dollar out of the franchise, but in knowing what it is it makes it worth that dollar.",Child's Play
37,jtindahouse,Back to a darker 'Chucky' and I liked it,6,20 June 2019,"The original 'Chucky' series had become a little stale in recent entries in my opinion. It had stopped taking itself seriously and each entry was basically just a violent comedy movie. So I was mildly happy to see that they had decided to reboot the series. It should be noted that the original 'Child's Play' was a very different type of movie to every other one in the series. It was a very understated film and was created more as a whodunnit mystery between the doll and 'Andy'. This reboot using the same name is very different to that original.What I liked most about this film was the balance is struck between humour and horror. While there were certainly moments intended to make you laugh, this one first and foremost sets out to scare people. I think these movies are much stronger when the balance leans in horror's favour. In fact the gore at times took me off-guard. There is some truly gruesome imagery.I really loved the choice to make Mark Hamill the voice of 'Chucky'. He used a very similar tone to that which he does with the 'Joker' and it worked masterfully. If they do make sequels to this film I would love to see him given free range to be as evil as he possibly can. Also the look of the doll was good. It took a little getting used to after having been accustomed to the original for so many years. But by the end of the film I had really come to like the look.The downside was that it never really managed to scare or unnerve me. Granted, I'm pretty tough to effect when it comes to horror movies, but I had hoped to get the heart racing just a little bit. I did have a good time with this movie nonetheless and would be interested to see where a series of sequels could lead to. Worth a look, just don't get your hopes up overly high and you should have a good time.",Child's Play
38,jadavix,"It's not the doll, it's the A.I.",7,9 February 2020,"This remake, or reboot, or whatever, of the Child's Play series of movies, was a lot better than I'd expected. It is consistently engaging, has some memorable death scenes, and approaches having some insight about the rising tide of artificial intelligence related products, which we may have some reason for being spooked about.If you remember, the original ""Child's Play"" was about a serial killer who uttered some magic words to possess a doll after a fatal shoot out with the cops left him in need of a new body.Demonic possession is kind of old hat these days, isn't it? Real life is far more terrifying because it's changing before our eyes and it's not hard to imagine how all this new technology could go wrong.It's a really clever idea to do away with the supernatural for this version of the story, and instead go with artificial intelligence. After all, if you can control technology, you don't need demons or Satan or any of that stuff. That's real power.I did detect a couple of problems with the movie, however, that kept it from greatness. For one thing, the direction is kind of dull for a horror, with an over-reliance on jump scares. It's really not scary, nor is there any tension.Another thing is that the true horror of the story is the idea of technology turning against that, but the movie seems to want to boil it down to the evil doll archetype. It made me want more, but what I got was still pretty good.",Child's Play

This is a reboot of the Chucky killer doll movies with none of the original people involved. It's a real reboot. The way the doll Chucky comes alive is totally different, too-no voodoo possessions in sight. Here, he is manufactured by an A.I. company to be a real friend to the family. He can control anything electronic in the house, from tv's to thermostats and is programmed to have no limitations to learning. But a mishap concerning a disgruntled employee at the manufacturing company causes the drama-and humor. In the original movies, the doll was called a Good Guy doll. Here, he is a Buddi doll, with new models taking on different personas such as teddy bears or leprechauns. Aubrey plays the mother of Gabriel, a 13 year old recipient of the malfunctioning Buddi doll-who names himself Chucky-voiced by Mark. Brian plays the police detective that gets involved in the murders performed by Mark.
It's rated ""R"" for bloody horror violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.

Really disappointed!,2,17 September 2019,"This film start with introduction of a tech company ""Kaslan"" and an AI doll ""Buddi"", later a Kaslan's Vietnam factory worker kill himself after he disable Buddi safety protocol scene! As turnout, this film is about a violent doll ""Buddi"" aka ""Chucky"" killing the people who disobey his owner ""Andy"" and he eventually want to revenge after Andy dump him! Andy actually want to name the doll as Han Solo but the doll name his own as Chucky! Ridiculous! LMFAO! Why don't simply call him Chucky from the beginning instead of Buddi! The face of Chucky also not scary at all! Waiting too long to set up the killing scene! The killing of the owner's cat don't even show to us! Chucky manipulate Andy's neighbor ""Doreen"" cab and hit another car, not even broke a car window and the killing of Doreen also not show to us! The killing of Andy's mother boyfriend ""Shane"" quite bloody! Shane fall down from a ladder and broke his leg clearly saw by us! He later chase by a mower and head get chop off! Another killing of the psychopath ""Gabe"" scene also bloody gore! His leg get chop off and his lower body too! The killing at the mart scene, quite disappointed! The mart full of crowd, but just the killing of a promoter show in detail! Pathetic!

The plot is good but the execution is not that great.Screenplay of the movie is average and gets slow and boring. The writers also fails in keeping the interest intact and viewers might get distracted.Acting in the movie is good and Bateman is the highlight of the movie.

48,Foreverisacastironmess123,"Yep, here's your problem, someone set this thing to evil!",7,29 June 2019,"I was pretty surprised by how much I enjoyed this, because like most people I really hate remakes. But I liked this because it wasn't quite like most of the half-assed cheap remakes I've ever seen that are little more than an obnoxious modern attitude and soulless cgi up the wazoo, because it actually put in the effort to distance itself from the original and do something new with the basic idea at the heart of the story while still keeping elements of it familiar enough that it doesn't alienate the fans of the classic original too much, at least that's how I took it. It really would have been better off just being its own original movie as it's really a Child's Play picture in name only, because it's fundamentally different, it's much more of a cautionary sci-fi tale of A.I. gone murderously haywire than a slasher about a doll possessed by the spirit of an evil man. Since it does have the Chucky stamp though it's mostly destined to just divide people on whether they like or hate it, but I loved how different it was to the original, that's how it should be with all remakes, maybe then they wouldn't be so rightfully despised so much! Chuckie looked so weird! His face was so wide and ugly, I think they may have deliberately been trying to make him look different than the classic Chuckie but the face of the techno tyke was more odd and off putting than straight-up nightmarish but it did fit the movie and again very much distinguished this incarnation of Chuckie from the first one. Mark Hamill really nailed it, very glad to see the man's considerable voice acting talents getting some new recognition like this, and while he doesn't go full Joker with it and really lets loose, he did have the right note of innocence and creepiness as his Chucky starts out all plain and robotic and gradually becomes more sinister as he 'logically' learns to kill and remove any obstacles between he and Andy's friendship! He's creepy but completely in his own way and he never feels like he's imitating or trying to match the iconic brilliance of Brad Dourif as the character, and it was his own interpretation and I liked it, I also thought the ending was kinda spooky, with Chuckie's malign program potentially being just about anywhere, he's become the proverbial ghost in the machine... It didn't take itself too seriously and didn't try to be all overly gritty and hard-edged, and there was a nice bit of dark humor in the very well done kill scenes, the big ending sequence did feel a bit tame and held back though, that whole scene with the killer toys attacking everybody clearly called for a real bloodbath! Oh thing I did actively dislike in the movie were Andy's friends and Aubrey Plaza as the mother, she was so awkward and stupid to watch, why was she in this movie? She stunk it up more than any other actor in it, I hated her lazy immature attitude, she came off more like his adult slacker babysitter than his mother.. Awful actress. So in closing it's more faulty robot gone crazy than possessed killer doll and definitely not the Chuckie we all grew up with, but is that really such a terrible thing really? While as a movie it doesn't compare to the horror magic of the true Chuckie at his best, as they go it's not a bad reimagining at all, very worthy of consideration and worth seeing! X",Child's Play
49,r96sk,Deserves respect,7,18 April 2020,"Arguably unnecessary, but 2019's remake of 'Child's Play' deserves respect for taking the story into a different direction and not just giving the original film a facelift.There's simply no beating Brad Dourif's Chucky, though Mark Hamill does a solid enough job in the lead role. The doll itself isn't as unnerving, yet it actually works well given the change in origin story for the redheaded villain. Aubrey Plaza and Gabriel Bateman are decent as Karen and Andy respectively.I initially anticipated this to be a terrible remake, but thankfully it is a reasonable new take on the impressive 1988 production. I, in fact, prefer this to 'Child's Play 3' and 'Seed of Chucky'.",Child's Play

The film is visually stunning to look at, it's got a really strong visual & colourful style & some very funny bits sprinkled throughout & a creepy atmosphere but i would say this version is more of a ""Techno-Thriller"" than a straight up Horror movie, there's more similarities here to Robot themed films like ""The Terminator"" & ""I,Robot"" than Slasher films.
There's also alot of nods to old school 80's films like E.T & of course the original Child's play & Gremilns & some other's but it also feels abit like Joe Dante's Small Soldiers too & those Toys were robotic with Microchips too!!!
The relationship between loner teen Andy & his early Birthday present ""Chucky"" is really sweet & cute at first & the performances by everyone is really good & Chucky looks AWESOME, his new design is great & i loved his eyes that glow red when he's angry it's so cool & Mark Hamill does a great job as the voice of Chucky, i loved his voice!!!
The Doll fx are excellent just as good as the old fx & there's lots of old school practical fx work here with abit of C.g.i here & there as expected but all in all it's got the old school feel just set in our digital technology obsessed world!!!
There's alot of fun to this film but there's still some really violent & gory killings but for most it's a very slick looking stylistic Techno-Thriller.Actually a great remake, it's just as fun as the original, it's just completely updated for todays times!!!",Child's Play
51,Pairic,Great Dark Fun,7,25 June 2019,"Child's Play: Chucky for millenials. The Kaslan Corporation has just launched Buddi: a high-tech doll which can connect to the Cloud, control the internet of things in your house, become your digital assistant and it can also also imprint on a child, becoming their BFF, entertaining them, even tutoring them. What could possibly go wrong? We see some real life horror as an exploited worker in the Asian sweatshop factory which manufactures Buddi is beaten by his boss, he takes revenge by removing a Buddi doll's safety protocols. This Buddi is returned as malfunctioning and Z-Mart clerk Karen (Aubrey Plaza) secures it gratis for her son Andy (Gabriel Bateman). Andy bonds with the Buddi who names himself Chucky ( voiced by Mark Hamill) and the fun begins.Chucky tends to take statements uttered by Andy as instructions and soon comes into conflict with Rooney the cat and Karen's beer-swilling loser boyfriend Shane (David Lewis). The danger signals are perhaps missed as Andy and his friends use Chucky to play pranks on people. Things start to take a dark turn but the shadows are leavened by the streak of humour which runs through the film: even as a scalp is ripped off it lands on a garden gnomes head. Chucky also learns from horror films and loses no time in imitating hillbilly serial killers. The lighting by cinematographer Brendan Uegama adds to the creepiness, eerie green light outdoors at night, bright rays shining through extractor fan vents partially illuminating darkened interiors. Falyn (Beatrice Kitsos) is outstanding as Andy's friend as she uses a chainsaw to ward off the devil doll.Plenty of gore and certainly nor for the squeamish,also the pacing is a bit off at times but director Lars Klevberg has delivered an enjoyable horror film with elements of humour and satire. 7/10.",Child's Play
52,TdSmth5,Kinda dull,6,17 November 2019,"Buddi is the latest techno craze sweeping the US. It's a doll/virtual assistant that can handle all your smart/automated devices and even self-driving cars. It's made by the Kaslan Corporation which has a monopoly on all these devices.In Vietnam a disgruntled employee assembling Buddi dolls decides to remove all safeguards and protections from a Buddi doll he's assembling before committing suicide. The defective doll makes it to the US and is returned to the retailed for unrelated reasons. The clerk who receives the doll then decides to give it as a gift to her son. The son, Andy has to wear a hearing aid and doesn't have many friends so the Buddi doll would be a good companion for him. The mom is seeing some guy who gives Andy a hard time. They are neighbors with a woman whose son is a police detective.Even though the doll is defective, Andy keeps Buddi around, not so much as an assistant but as a friend. The doll first needs to be programmed and even though Andy has to assign it a name, Buddi picks the name Chucky for himself and swears eternal friendship to Andy. Andy does make a some friends and they have a great time watching gory horror movies, something Chucky notes. When the family cat attacks Andy, Chucky takes revenge on the cat. Next on the list is the mom's boyfriend who's killed gruesomely. Chucky keeps the guy's face and gives it to Andy and the kids now have to find some silly way to dispose of the guy's face. Eventually they've had enough of Chucky, remove his power supply and throw him away. But some guy living in the basement resurrects Chucky. Now Chucky goes on a rampage just as Kaslan is about to release Buddi 2.0 to an eager crowd.Child's Play is your teen-centered (as is fashionable today) R-rated (for some reason) horror movie. It's a mild R though as there isn't much violence or gore, let alone any nudity. Andy is likeable enough and thankfully has a normal haircut not that usual Hollywood haircut they inflict on poor boys. The adult actors though play it all a bit too tongue-in-cheek. The doll is ugly and creepy enough. But it takes nearly half of the movie for the action to begin and it doesn't really keep the pace going.For the budget, Child's Play is alright. It's not bad but it's not something particularly good either. They should have made better use of the lower budget to give us some more characters for Chucky to kill.",Child's Play

54,peterp-450-298716,A more modern version of the original.,5,5 December 2019,"What's your name?
Andy. 'Sup?
Hi, Andysup.It seems like a lifetime ago since I saw the original film with the demonic pop Chucky dangerously swinging around with a razor-sharp butcher knife. Well, It's not a hundred years, but thirty years is a long time as well. That's how long it's been since I went to get the VHS of this movie in the local video store. Apparently several sequels have been made after the initial release. Somehow I've missed that. Me and sequels. It remains an eternal struggle. Because there wasn't anything better to choose from and I had nothing to do, I still took the risk and watched this modern version. Apart from the fact that the doll looks slightly different, has been given a different name and the reason for its malicious behavior has changed slightly, it was exactly as if I went back in time. ""Child's Play"" has the same 80s horror mood.But first of all a big compliment to the makers of this pimped version. Most reboots or remakes just seem like a duplicate of the original. Here they really deviate from the original story. It's not the soul of a serial killer that transforms the doll into a bloodthirsty, diabolical murderous toy. Here it's an aggrieved and irritated Chinese factory worker who starts to mess with the security software out of revenge. To be honest, I felt like giving up at that moment. A ragged and clearly unkempt Chinese guy reprogramming the source software was, in my eyes, completely absurd and exaggerated. Fortunately, I persisted. Because all in all ""Child's Play"" wasn't so bad.What disappointed me a bit, was the doll itself. Especially the transformation from good to evil. In the original film, Chucky did get a diabolical and cruel expression. In this movie, they wanted to achieve the same effect by providing Buddi (as this child-friendly babysitter is now called) with red-glowing eyes. Well, it wasn't really scary. And to be honest, this film isn't creepy at all. I thought it was rather entertaining horror material, suitable for the novice horror enthusiast. Don't expect any nasty-looking killings either. You'll see clichéd situations where circular saws and a lawnmower (or something like that) are used in. The favorite murder instruments from the 80s.The acting was generally acceptable. Only Aubrey Plaza as Andy's mother wasn't really convincing. To be honest, she seemed to be the sister of Andy (Gabriel Bateman), the introverted boy with a hearing problem. David Lewis played the most annoying character. That means you can say that his acting was successful. The most light-hearted and comical part was provided by Brian Tyree Henry as police officer Mike, who lives with his mother. It's not only the mother-son correlation that sometimes causes hilarious moments. There are also slapstick-like scenes, such as the gift-wrapped item (Well, I try to stay vague about this) that falls into the hands of Mike's mother by mistake. Most surprising in this film was the fact that Mark Hamill (Yes, Luke Skywalker himself) was responsible for Chucky's dialogues.In the end, this was a creditable attempt to breathe new life into the Chucky franchise. This modernized version is not an epic film but is anything but bad. It even tries to portray a failing A.I. and point out the dangers of a robotic society. And actually, what Chucky is doing, is simply the result of a learning process that he undergoes in the company of Andy. If the latter makes a remark that he would rather get rid of the cat Mickey Rooney, you already know the verdict. In the end, Chucky is nothing more than an electronic gadget that ignores the robotics laws of Asimov. It's not really impressive or exciting at all. But ""Child's Play"" was a nice time-killer.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Child's Play
55,questl-18592,Chucky 8,3,30 September 2019,"Good lord, there's 8 of these things now. After 7 previous encounters with the demon doll, Chucky is BACK and after watching it I think we can say for sure that after 7 other movies... They still have no clue what they're doing.Child's Play (2019) is a mess. Starting with the infamous doll that looks just horrible, inconsistent and off-putting but not in a way that works. The child actor playing opposite the doll is equally unimpressive and, despite at times seeming clever, still acts like a complete imbecile when it matters and his friends aren't any better.On the flip side, Mark Hamill's voice work is wonderful, as always. And Aubrey Plaza, wow! She steals the movie as the struggling mom and delivers a solid performance.Where the movie falls apart the most though is in its own identity. Take away the Chucky aspect and you're left with a pretty interesting horror movie about the dangers of our ever increasing reliance on devices and the inter connectivity of said devices. Instead they have to cram in this nonsense Buddi doll angle to make it fit the Child's Play brand and that drags what could have been something interesting down to a dumb, inconsistent slasher flick that may have worked 30 years ago but not today.",Child's Play
56,I_Ailurophile,"An entertaining, worthy reinvention of a horror staple",8,3 October 2021,"It's been a very long time since I've seen the 1988 movie 'Child's play,' or the first sequel released in 1990, but I recall both very fondly as excellent, now classic slabs of horror. I'm broadly very skeptical of sequels or remakes - but on the other hand, I'm a big fan of Aubrey Plaza, so it felt like this 2019 film was worth a try. For my part, I'm pleased that while unquestionably over the top, this re-imagined take on the story is a great bit of fun.This rendition immediately imparts to us that while it shares fundamental similarities with its progenitor, the 2019 'Child's play' is also a movie all its own. The ""Buddi"" doll is much more than just a toy, and both its nature and ""Chucky's"" origin story are updated to reflect the early 21st century instead of the 1980s. The screenplay as a whole has been modernized in that regard, too, with themes present of lack of corporate accountability, mistreatment of workers - and especially the all-consuming ubiquity of technology, and the varied issues that can, do, and will arise from it. It's also worth noting a wonderfully wry, morbid, sardonic humor that persists throughout the film, even as terrible events escalate - neatly matching the characteristic style that star Plaza demonstrates elsewhere.With Chucky getting a refresh, the overall slant of the film also necessarily differs, but the essence is the same. There are definite thrills and suspense accompanying the growing bloodbath. The blood and gore, though sometimes excessive, is done well, and each successive scene of horror is strikingly vicious. For that matter, too, all due commendations for folks operating behind the scenes in hair, makeup, lighting, and effects - the hard work certainly paid off.All the while, the cast is fantastic. It feels strange to say 'Child's play' represents an unusually conventional role for Plaza as mother Karen, but that's certainly true compared to the very offbeat features she usually takes on. She excels, as expected, utilizing her super talent to embody the terror and confusion of an archetypal horror part. Young Gabriel Bateman is superb as protagonist Andy, ably inhabiting a dynamic role requiring great range and physicality of the young actor. This is hardly to count out anyone else present, though - Brian Tyree Henry as warm Detective Mike; Beatrice Kitsos, Ty Consiglio, and Marlon Kazadi as Andy's friends; and all the rest of the cast are swell. And of course one would be terribly remiss not to mention the outstanding contribution of voice actor extraordinaire Mark Hamill, realizing Chucky with all the cheeky malice he can so capably muster.This represents only the first feature film of screenwriter Tyler Burton Smith, and the second of director Lars Klevberg. A great deal of trust was placed in them both, and I for one think they've pulled off a great success. There's a soft spot in my heart for the 1988 and 1990 'Child's play' movies, but the 2019 movie is sufficiently unique that it stands on its own without needing to draw endless comparisons. True, the updates are perhaps a bit ham-handed, but they are executed deftly nonetheless, neatly sliding into place as part of this slightly less fantastical tale of a doll gone berserk.I can understand attachment to the original movies flavoring one's perceptions of this, nevermind the varying tapestry of opinion and criticism that ensues from any major release. Yet I entered with mixed if hopeful expectations, and have been delighted by the great care that went into this in every regard to honor its predecessors while also staking its own territory. So long as one can be receptive to remakes and overlook occasionally overt plot points, I think this 2019 version of 'Child's play' is a highly enjoyable, well-made slasher that's well worth checking out.",Child's Play
57,truemythmedia,Fun Gory Horror Flick,6,18 October 2019,"Well, I've done it. I've officially seen every ""Child's Play""/ Chucky film ever made. What an accomplishment, right? Well, obviously, I wouldn't have put myself through ten plus hours of Chucky if I weren't at least a little bit of a fan; I am. Much like Freddy Krueger from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, Chucky's brand of horror isn't wholly horrifying, in fact, most of the time the horror elements are played for laughs.There were seven films in the original run, and all of them had the involvement of Don Mancini (director of ""Seed of Chucky""), the creator, and Brad Douriff (""Curse of Chucky""), who played the original voice of Chucky. I honestly think the series starts to get better after the third entry- the first three entries were sort of rushed out and sloppy, and the forth film in the series (""Bride of Chucky"") really starts to develop the series' voice into one that is more comedic. Then the sixth entry in the series (""Curse of Chucky""), makes another shift in tone and tries to be more horrific again, and it actually accomplishes it pretty well. Since the latest entry in the Chucky franchise (""Cult of Chucky"") came out in 2017, I wondered what this new Chucky movie could add to the franchise- if it added anything at all.To my delight, I found this film does have something it wants to say, and while I don't think I enjoy Mark Hamill's (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"") version of Chucky as much as Brad Douriff's, I did think this film had plenty of things that would draw in fans of the original series. The slasher scenes are actually pretty great. You can't have a Chucky movie without some absolutely bonkers death scenes, and this film certainly delivers. Some of the stuff that happens in the movie is actually pretty horrific and grotesque, but the tongue-in-cheek way its approached paired with the vibrantly colored blood makes it more humorous than anything else. The ending sequence goes gloriously off the rails, and I found myself just giddy with laughter. I'm a fan of the ""Child's Play"" series, but saying that, I know that the series isn't remarkably compelling or well done; they're just cheesy horror flicks with a few laughs. While this wasn't my favorite Chucky film (I think ""Seed of Chucky"" is still the funniest), I do think that fans of the franchise will find plenty of things to connect with in this movie.",Child's Play

59,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Fun, but Flawed Remake",8,24 June 2019,"This was a film that I was kind of torn on. The sequels in the original franchise are films I grew up on and the idea of Chucky can really be quite creepy. The look of the doll was troubling to me, but I was down for the use of the cloud and how much technology we utilize in our lives. The synopsis is a mother gives her 13-year-old son a toy doll for his birthday, unaware of its more sinister nature.We start off with learning about the Kaslan Company from Henry Kaslan (Tim Matheson). He tells us all about they're making lives easier with technology and that their newest toy, the Buddi doll, is able sync up with everything in the house to make your life even easier. He is also your best friend.It then shifts to a factory in Vietnam where they're making these toys. We see a disgruntled worker being yelled at by his superior. He can't take it any longer and he turns off all of the controls that prevent these dolls from swearing and hurting people around it in one of the chips. He then commits suicide.In the United States, we follow a family of Karen Barclay (Aubrey Plaza) and her son Andy (Gabriel Bateman). They just moved into a new apartment. She works at a place called Zed Mart in the Returns and Customer Service area. She is dealing with upset customers and we see that her quirky, sarcastic attitude comes in handy. Andy is a bit lonely though. He doesn't have any friends and he is kind of a loner.We can see they don't have a lot of money. Andy's phone is cracked and Karen can't afford to fix it. One day at work, a Buddi doll gets returned for being a bit defective. She convinces her manager to let her keep it since the new one is coming out soon. She gives it to Andy as kind of a joke gift. He isn't thrilled at first, but he does turn it on. It kind of stutters at times and when it asks what is its name, he says Han Solo, what it heard was Chucky. It is of course voiced by the great Mark Hamill.Andy ends up taking a liking to the toy, but this of course is the one that the worker tampered with. It is able to swear and be more violent than it is supposed to. Andy does befriend Pugg (Ty Consiglio) and Falyn (Beatrice Kitsos) who also live in his building. He is a hit with what Chucky can do. Things take a dark turn though when Chucky see them watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and how much fun they're having. It thinks that violence is okay. Chucky takes defending Andy too far and it comes quite the problem, especially with Shane (David Lewis), Karen's boyfriend.Now I have to be honest here, this film isn't as bad as I originally thought it was going to be. To be honest, I actually had a lot of fun with this one. I love the idea of the doll being possessed by Charles Lee Ray in the original film, but I'm not going to lie, this one is actually way more plausible to be honest. It actually makes more sense that something within its programming being tampered with allowing it to do things that it does. It is learning like an AI and not being programmed with knowing right from wrong, definitely makes this plausible. It is quite scary as I'm convinced one day, computers will wake up and take over.That leads me to the next thing about this film, the use of technology. I will admit that I think the film goes a bit overboard with the idea that everything from the thermometer, their television and their home security would all be the same company. I get that it is a convenience for this to happen, but I think just being Bluetooth would work just fine. I do think though that we use technology way too much in our lives and I'm extremely guilty of that. It is terrifying what Chucky can do. It definitely culminates in the ending sequence and I loved the idea of that.I do kind of wish they would have gone a bit farther than what they did. I think this could have rivaled the original for me if it could have been a bit more mean-spirited. I love the idea that Chucky can take over other Buddi dolls as I know this is something that gets explored by the original creator of the idea, Don Mancini, in his later films of the series. I just think we cut away from some deaths too early and we didn't get enough later in the film either.That brings me to the pacing of the movie, which is good. I think that we really establish the characters early and then start to build them from there. I like that Andy isn't thrilled about his present, but he is lonely. We actually get to see Chucky learning all of the things he says and does later from Andy and his friends. I do think some of them are a bit forced, but I can overlook that a bit. I like what they decided to do for the climax of the film. It just didn't go as far as I wanted. I do like the ending though. It is fine for what we got. The movie does leave itself open for a possible sequel and there are things that are hinted at in this one that could make this a bigger problem for sure.As for the acting of the film, I thought it was pretty solid to be honest. I was worried about Plaza, because I wasn't sure if she could play the age of the character. She does though. She acknowledges that she got pregnant at a very young age and I think her child's personality is reflected in that. It actually worked and she did a really good job here. The voice of Chucky wasn't picked until very late and was a point of contention, but I think they picked the perfect person to voice the character in Hamill, as from of course Brad Dourif. He brings such a creepy level to it that works and makes it his own. Bateman was solid, because as you know, children actors are hit or miss. I liked Brian Tyree Henry as Detective Mike Norris. He brings a certain level of comedy that also worked. Matheson, Kitsos and Consiglio all did fine in their roles. I do have to point out Trent Redekop as the character Gabe; he brings another creepy level to the film with what he's doing. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.To the effects of the film, they were actually not bad at all. They did go practical for the most part with blood and the doll itself. I have to be honest, after finally seeing this move the look of Chucky is just bad. I think his movements are fine though. They do have some CGI in there, but I really didn't have any issues with it to be honest. There is some CGI blood as well, but not too much actually. The blood and kills were actually really good. My gripe there is I wanted to see more. The film is shot very well and the use of technology enhances the tension as well.Now with that said, this film is better than I was expecting if I'm going to be perfectly honest. I did have a lot of fun with this. I really like the concept of this toy having Bluetooth capabilities and the implications there. Some of the things that stem from that definitely help drive the tension. If anything though, I wanted them to just go a bit farther for me. I thought the climax was a slight letdown for what they did, but the ending was fine. The acting of the film I thought was good and the effects for the most part were as well. The look of the doll just really bothers me still. The soundtrack of the film didn't stand out, but it did fit the scenes for what was needed. I will say, the Buddi song from the movie that Chucky sings is quite creepy. I think this is a pretty good film though overall. I would recommend giving it a viewing.",Child's Play

61,rgkarim,Time to Reboot Andy,7,21 June 2019,"The campiness of horror movies can sometimes be amazing source of entertainment. Humorous plots that are ridiculous, blended with just enough disturbing concepts to etch itself in your brain can be quite a cult phenomenon. So years later, and many revivals, it looks like one of those movies is going to attempt to reboot itself to try and modernize its moves. Welcome to Robbie's Movie Reviews and today we are looking at none other than the demented doll himself, the serial killer of craziness, and the toy of terror. That's right we look at:Movie: Child's Play (2019)Director:

The Lack of DirectionSummary:The Child's Play series has not been consistent in the scare department, but the series certainly stays the course of being campy. It's fun, and much of this has to do with the simplicity of the film and the 80s style comedy masked in modern wrapping paper. The dialog itself is corny, but the delivery and timing work, especially hearing the edge return to Chucky as the movie progresses. Yet unlike the other movies, the murderous doll surprisingly has a little more development than the previous sadistic doll we know and love. Resetting his origins, I actually felt a little sorry more for this iteration, which some may or may not like. This Chucky is will eventually fall back into some classic quirks, but with a little more depth to what once was such a simple role. And as the movie has taken many modern twists, I found that the familiarity of the series still remains in the movie from the simplistic story to the corny kills, it holds many nostalgic moments that should pull some of the fans back into the series. Finally, the voice acting that they casted is a fine display of the creepy atmosphere that horror movies need. Hamill accomplishes the goal of injecting that stalker like atmosphere that sends shivers down your spine and make Chucky come to life at the same time. Much like his work in the 90s, the former Jedi knows how to add so much to a role that one would normally find limited. And it may be that acting that carries much of the movie alongside the use of the demented doll.
Yet the movie has some flaws that my friends and I noticed that could be strong limitations for audience members. First off its predictable. While my initial guess at the twist was wrong, Child's Play has had much revealed in the trailers and what has not can easily be guessed. From the collective rest of the acting crew, who is more so predictable knife fodder, the characters are so monopolar that one can't help but be detached to most of the gang recruited into this arsenal. Sadly, most of the actors don't seem quite interested in the movie, with many again presenting uninteresting characters that just do little for me. Sure the young Andy has some potential, but others are just extreme targets for Chucky to hunt, speaking of which. The kills that Child's Play comes up with are like something out of a demented playbook, and this movie has begun the path that will surely grow more ridiculous with time. Over the top, immaculate kills are part of that nostalgic campiness, but at times they are a little dragged out in the torture department, leading to cringe worth moments of disturbing death. In particular is one kill that defies my big rules, so if you have read for years, be prepared for that component. No, the big thing this movie suffers from for me is the lack of direction it seems to have. Is it comedy? Is it slasher? Is it nostalgia? Is it horror? I can't quite tell, but the various spread made it seem like an awkward blend that is interesting to describe. Like an over budgeted Are You Afraid Of The Dark Special, this Child's Play is not quite achieving the directions that it wanted, leading to an awkward enjoyment that is not quite awful, but not super good either.
The verdict of this film is that it has its ups and down and is sort of a mediocre display of chills and thrills. Comedy wise it's managed to pull the series back to grounded levels from the last installments, and it has returned to the gruesome kills that made the series famous. Yet, Mark Hamill's acting cannot quite bring the lack of direction together and the modern focus on aggressive death might be a little too extreme and unnecessary. Still, the movie starts out decently okay and perhaps can start upgrading itself to the next models for increasing the quality for a certain sequel to come.My scores are:Horror: 7.0
Movie Overall: 5.5 - 6.0",Child's Play
62,Kamurai25,"This proves how good ""I Robot"" was.",7,15 June 2020,"Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend everyone should watch this at least once.This is basically a bad version of ""I Robot"", it is FAR removed from its original source while managing to be creepy and dark in an additional dozen ways.Instead of the adult serial killer trapped in a child's doll by satanic ritual, we have a malfunctioning android that wants to be its (second) owner's ""best friend"" so much it'll kill him, and possible the rest of the world.I don't feel like Andy's character and arc is explored enough to really make the suspense they were attempting be weighted properly.Overall, there are plenty of interesting and entertaining bits to this movie: I don't think I've seen Aubrey Plaza in a role close to this, let alone a doting mother.Brian Tyree Henry was an interesting find here as well, I feel like Det. Mike was also underdeveloped: come to think of it, those are the two I wanted more development from, but everyone is under developed, honestly even Chucky.The CG Animation honestly isn't super great at times, and the practical doll is terrifyingly creepy.There are a lot of problems in this movie, but they're minor (if numerous) and there is still a lot to enjoy for this movie, at least for a first viewing.",Child's Play
63,justin-fencsak,Just as good as the original but with a few new twists...,8,21 June 2019,"After seeing this movie I think it stands on its own as a good remake of a classic story of an evil toy and his owner. Aubrey plaza shines as the hot mom of the boy who gets a new doll that in the remake is a robot run by smart technology. It moves pretty fast and the colors and sound shine in this film. Mark hamoll is awesome and the kids behave good in this film that's not for kids, who should go see that other toy m obie instead.",Child's Play
64,vengeance20,A 2010's Child's Play!,9,22 June 2019,"Was looking forward to this film when I seen the first teaser, but even that didn't show a great deal in terms of the death sequences or visuals that I might see. But either way being a fan of the franchise (first 3 films) not to mention being a sort of fan of the original, I was looking forward to this one.The vision in this remake is different to the original. For one, the Voodoo angle is ditched in favour for a factory worker in Vietnam who is lonely & badly treated. The company is called Kaslan Industries not Play Pals & the company specialises in electronic devices not toys. The dolls are not toys but more of a cross between a doll & an Alexa type device. The dolls are not called Good Guys, but called Buddi's.
So the film is made for the new generation & does so so well with all the traits.So the doll is tampered with & is somehow made evil by Andy as a pose to a serial killer taking the form of the doll. Interesting idea but a shame it didn't go with the Voodoo path.The kills were pretty good, gory & creative & the action scenes were well done. There was a lot going on in the film too, the climax was pretty good! I like how because the doll was a walking talking Alexa, it was able to mess around with the other devices from the same company because of the connection he had from the same company, it was actually pretty good in that sense! The way Chucky was able to manipulate the environment accordingly to kill his victims was very Final Destination esque.The only things that bothered me was the look of the new Chucky, that & the fact that Chucky being evil because of some safety protocols being removed. Chucky would have to at least have a ""human"" inside of him in order for him to do the things he did, he wouldn't think evil things or act on them unless he had the mind of a human, that's kind of what got me.Overall the film was pretty good & I say that it was a lot better than the orginal. I do so hope for more sequels to follows this! 9/10",Child's Play
65,elliotjeory,Overall a good film,7,19 September 2019,"It is difficult to adjust to the new Chucky, he doesn't look or sound the same and it's kind of lame at first but once the story kicks in it's not bad. There's some good horror scenes and good acting, it's a modern spin on a classic and as long you don't compare it too much to the original it's an enjoyable film.",Child's Play
66,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Sorry Jack... This Chucky's bland! 2019's toothless ""Child's Play"" reboot lacks the fun (and frights) of the riskier, creepier original.",4,10 July 2019,"So there's a scene in 2019's questionable ""Child's Play"" reboot where a group of kids watch Tobe Hooper's camp-classic ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,"" while the new techno-gadget Chucky ominously watches them in the background. It's supposed to be a tense scene, as Chucky begins to malfunction and emulate the violence on-screen. And yet... the only thing I could notice was that the clips they showed from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" were dreadfully out of order. I didn't care about the creepy doll watching in the distance, ready to strike. And I didn't fear for the safety of the children. I just kept noticing how badly they botched the editing....and that should sufficiently sum up how invested I found myself in director Lars Klevberg's new film. I cared more about a movie-within-the-movie than I did about the movie itself.Yes, after a somewhat tumultuous production that was wrought with drama, the remake of the classic killer-doll film is finally here. And as is all too often the case with retreads of classic materials... it ended up amounting to a whole 'lotta nothing. 2019's ""Child's Play"" is just another toothless, mediocre redo that will likely be forgotten the instant it leaves theaters. It's never as fun, nor as frightening as the franchise that inspired it. And whenever it tries to do something to set itself apart, it just never really comes together.Andy Barclay (Gabriel Bateman) is a 13-year-old boy whose having a bit of a rough time. He's having trouble fitting in and finding friends, and his mother Karen (Aubrey Plaza) is always working or spending time with her skeevy boyfriend. (David Lewis) But everything is about to change when Andy meets his new best friend... a high-tech ""smart doll"" named ""Chucky"" (voice of Mark Hamill) that his mother oh-so-ironically gives him as a gift one night. But soon enough, Andy will learn that there something is very wrong with Chucky... something devious... and something deadly...Now despite my somewhat dismissive opening, I will admit that there are indeed a fistful of things about ""Child's Play"" that almost make it worth a watch. Almost. Not the least of which being the new origin for the beloved killer doll. I actually enjoyed the concept of Chucky being an artificially-intelligent gadget that is corrupted and gradually turns evil. It takes a familiar concept and gives it a new spit-and-polish. I also quite enjoyed the bulk of the cast, including Plaza's likable turn as a struggling mother and Brian Tyree Henry in a supporting role as the Barclay's detective neighbor. They're just so enjoyable in their parts.So it's a shame that they are to the service of a slap-dash story that just doesn't really do much with them. It's hard not to notice how disjointed and how poorly developed the film is. So many ideas and storylines are brought up and then never paid off. So many characters are introduced and then never given an ounce of development. It feels like a film that never went past its first draft. Case in point being the fact that our new Andy is established as being handicapped by way of hearing loss. The movie goes out of its way to bring this up repeatedly throughout its first half... but it never pays off. Sure, Chucky talks to him through his hearing aid for about five seconds... but what's the point? It doesn't add anything to the character. Or Andy's new friends Pugg and Falyn, who he meets about halfway through... the movie introduces them, and they pal around with him... but we never learn anything about them, and thus we never care about them. It's just frustrating how little development the film gives to any of its concepts. All the previous films- even the lesser entries like ""Child's Play 3""- at least tried to work with their concepts. But not this one. It just feels lazy.I also took some serious issue with the direction and the general presentation of the film. I will say that director Klevberg's general guidance of the film is mostly slick and solid. It's reasonably well-shot and there's a few nifty kill scene to satisfy your inner gore-hound. But, much like the story... it feels really disjointed. Some of the visual and tonal choices felt contrary to one-another, with scenes feeling like they were ripped from different films. It kinda took me out of the experience and made it hard for me to connect with the film. There's also a few head-scratching scenes where glaring errors were left in. While I won't say anything specific as to avoid spoilers, if you really pay attention, there's some really sloppy work in a few key scenes. Again... it just lends to it feeling lazy.And then there's the design and execution of Chucky. Oh, boy... As much as I enjoyed the techno-doll angle, the biggest fault of the film is the way they handle Chucky himself. I'm sorry... but it was a really mixed bag. And it can be incredibly distracting. It was the one thing they needed to get just right, and they failed pretty hard at times. I cannot fathom how the doll looks, moves and ""acts"" worse in this film than it did in the original. Not only is he just ugly to look at, which makes it impossible to buy the idea he's some hot-selling item... but the puppetry is very mixed. There's plenty of scenes where it looks great. But at other times, you can just feel the puppeteers off-camera. And there are also some moments where Chucky is replaced by a CG model... and it's always really obvious and immediately removes you from the film, because the CG model doesn't really move like the puppet. It's just... wonky as heck.I know this film has its fans. And I respect that they found something to like about it. But I'm sorry... as a life-long ""Chucky"" fan, this reboot just did nothing for me. I was intrigued by it and gave it a fair chance... but it ended up leaving a very bad taste in my mouth when the credits rolled. And I'm certainly far more interested in further sequels to the original franchise than I am for any potential sequels to this film. 2019's ""Child's Play"" gets a sub-par 4 out of 10 from me. Sorry Jack... but this Chucky's just kinda bland.",Child's Play
67,fntstcplnt,Child's Play (2019),6,20 January 2020,"Directed by Lars Klevberg. Starring Gabriel Bateman, Audrey Plaza, Brian Tyree Henry, Ty Consiglio, Beatrice Kitsos, David Lewis, Carlease Burke, Marlon Kazadi, Tim Matheson, Trent Redekop, (voice) Mark Hamill. (R)Less a remake or reboot than a remodel of the popular horror franchise about a killer doll named Chucky. Stacks up well enough against the decent original, marrying slasher thrills with tongue-in-cheek humor, but is more memorable for its modern polish and curious choices than anything else. For one, the doll isn't possessed by a killer this time; it's the fault of bad coding in a high-tech toy from an Amazon-esque multinational corporation. For another, the kid (Bateman) who's given the doll is way too old to be interested in such playthings (he's more than twice as old as the little boy from the original). Then there's the casting of Plaza as the boy's mom, who displays the nurturing instinct of a filial cannibal--she behaves like a snarky older sister or ""cool aunt"" at best. The filmmakers did much better in choosing Hamill as the voice of Chucky, even though he had the unenviable task of going up against Brad Dourif's iconic interpretation. Half-formed ideas and hijinks aplenty; satisfying with lowered expectations, though it feels a little long even at just an hour-and-a-half.57/100",Child's Play
68,m-47826,Good but useless remake.,4,11 June 2021,"I liked how bold it was. At being gorier than expected, and killing off sympathetic characters. But at the end of the day, it is completely forgotten two years after its release. No sequels would be possible, otherwise it would lean too much towards a sci-fi approach. And the franchise works best as a horror/slasher. And the movie itself is a complete re-reading of a classic that needed no remake in the first place. And can't justify its existence. Also, I wasn't a big fan of how Andy's mother was portrayed in that version. Like a very exaggerated one of the character from the original movie.",Child's Play
69,Foutainoflife,Re-Imagining Not A Re-Make,7,29 September 2019,"I personally think they did a great job with this. Initially I thought it would be pretty weird to have a 13 year old boy messing around with a doll. It just didn't seem age appropriate but it ended up working.My only real complaint was that it seemed to take a bit longer than I would've liked to get started. After it started though, it seemed to run at a fairly consistent pace. The tweaking of the plot worked and it fit well into how we live our lives now.I say check it out. It is not what you'd expect but that was what made it good and a film that can hold its own.",Child's Play

72,michaeltrivedi,Yes!,7,4 November 2019,"The remake of the original Child's Play is a really fun watch. It's not necessarily that spooky or scary, but it really is a fun addition to the horror genre.This time, Chucky's evil ways are due to a technical error in artificial intelligence as opposed to a supernatural thing. That's the only thing that really bothered me with the movie. This way, it lost it's atmospheric creepiness.The story is about a boy who receives this doll from his sort of trashy mother. And then things go from there as the doll starts to grow a mind of his own.Definitely worth watching.7 stars",Child's Play
73,Pumpkin_Man,A Surprisingly Good Modern Twist on an 80's Slasher Classic!!!,10,22 June 2019,"As a lifelong Chucky fan, I actually really enjoyed this new Child's Play remake. It was different, fun, creepy, and gory. This new A.I. Chucky is almost sympathetic, but turns very sinister. I'm one of those weird people that laugh at the gory death scenes. I intentionally avoided trailers so I'd be more surprised, and it helped. Mark Hamill did a great job voicing Chucky. At times, I actually kinda felt sorry for Chucky because he just wanted Andy to love him and be best friends with him, but he grows so much more menacing. The gore and death scenes are cool and interesting.Andy Barclay is a hearing impaired teenager who just moved into a new apartment with his mom, Karen. He doesn't have any friends, so Karen buys him a new 'Buddi' doll. The Buddi doll connects to cell phones, t.v., computers, basically anything electronic in the house. The doll misunderstands Andy, so he starts calling himself Chucky. (Unfortunately, this Buddi doll was tampered with by a disgruntled factory worker in Vietnam, disabling all of the safety features.)Andy and Chucky start out as really good pals, playing chess, hanging out, watching movies, but soon, Chucky sees Andy being hurt, so he slowly develops psychotic tendencies, and watches Andy and his new friends viewing a horror movie on tv one night, which confuses Chucky into thinking killing is okay.Soon enough, Chucky gets a thirst for killing, and Andy tries to cover it up, but it's too late. Hopefully I didn't spoil too much. I'm just really excited about this new movie and I hope all the old school Chucky fans give it a chance. It's definitely different and nothing like the originals, but that's what makes it cool, intriguing, fun, and interesting. I highly recommend CHILD'S PLAY!!!",Child's Play
74,Stephen_A_Abell,Chucky Is Dead... But It's Still An Entertaining Film...,7,17 September 2020,"My Ratings:
Story 1.00 : Direction 1.50 : Pace 1.50 : Acting 1.25 : Entertaining 1.50
Total 6.75 out of 10.00Firstly, let me state this is not Chucky. There was a sound reason behind the Good Guy doll being named Chucky in the original. This was due to the doll being possessed by the soul of Charles ""Chucky"" Lee Ray. However, in this re-boot, there's no reason for the doll to be named Chucky. He could have been called Abdul, Bob, or Cynthia.To be honest, it's the flaws in the story that impairs the film. I like the abused worker taking revenge on his company by altering the doll's security protocols. Unfortunately, it's evident writer, Tyler Burton Smith, doesn't have a clue how a company production line works. Millions of this doll are being produced. Surprisingly, there appears to be a lone worker on the line. He disables the protocols after being slapped and reprimanded by his boss. This begs the question, what kind of software program were they running that would allow an A.I. to hurt people? The coding should have been cheap and cheerful. It meant the doll would learn a few pertinent things, such as the owners' likes and dislikes. However, when the security is off, the A.I. can process information like thoughts. It learns how to play chess and learns strategy and how to kill people... The processing power for this wouldn't be cost-effective to place in a piece of plastic tech for kiddies. Had the employee worked in the coding department and uploaded his private code to the doll, this would have glossed over some holes. All Smith then needed to do was to restrict the doll in its actions to match the alien program.Even though the story is Swiss cheese, it's eased a little by Lars Klevberg's direction. He is very skilled at using pace and lighting to create a tense and suspenseful atmosphere. In fact, he incorporates this intensity in the films most humourous scene. When Andy has to get the ""present"" back from his neighbour you're laughing but you're also screaming, ""Grab it and run kid!"" You're holding your breath because the tension is so tight. You just want Andy to complete his mission so the scene will be over, and you can breathe a sigh of relief.The acting is above average and the actors and actresses represent their characters well. Though, none of them stands out above the others. I find a film where all the cast and characters are comparable more convincing and enjoyable. You're not thinking, wow he's great or damn, she stinks. It allows the viewer to immerse themselves into the story.So, as long as you take your brain out before you hit play, you should enjoy this film. I even found myself enjoying the movie despite the horrendously written story. It's less favourable than the original. It's not as imaginative or as darkly humorous, but it's not a bad way to waste some time; and in these days of lockdown, a pleasant method of wasting time is something we require. Just don't view this is a ""Chucky"" film. It's not.Cast your brain cells and eyes across to my Absolute Horror and The Final Frontier lists to see where this re-boot landed in my rankings.Take Care and Stay Well.",Child's Play
75,muamba_eats_toast,Enjoyable slasher,6,22 June 2019,Film is a little all over the shop and B movie but that partly adds to the charm. A bit slow but good slasher once gets going although story and tension lacking.,Child's Play

77,IonicBreezeMachine,"While it doesn't match the original, the 2019 remake of Child's Play is one of the better horror remakes and manages to give its own voice to the material",6,23 October 2021,"Conglomerate Kaslan Corporation has launched an interactive line of smart dolls called Buddi which thanks to their learning AI, Cloud syncing, and ability to sync with and control other Kaslan products has made them a high demand item. In a manufacturing plant in Vietnam, a disgruntled worker angered by casual abuse and substandard conditions as a final act deletes all safety subroutines in one of the Bubbi's programming before committing suicide. In Chicago, single mother Karen (Aubrey Plaza) and her 12 year old hearing impaired son Andy (Gabriel Bateman) are still adjusting to the move with Andy lonely and without many friends. When Karen receives a malfunctioning Buddi at her job handling returns at Zed Mart, she takes it home and gives it to Andy to cheer him up. The Buddi (Mark Hamil) names itself ""Chucky"" and while initially Andy is unenthused about Chucky, Chucky's ability to swear among other things creates a rapport between the two and even serves as a bridge to make friends with neighbors Falyn (Beatrice Kitsos) and Pugg (Ty Consiglio). However when Chucky starts exhibiting hostile actions towards those who make Andy ""unhappy"", it becomes apparent that Chucky has a dark edge beneath his seemingly ""friendly"" demeanor.Following the release of Seed of Chucky in 2004, discussions had been held as far back as 2009 regarding rebooting Child's Play with Chucky actor Brad Dourif and series writer Don Mancini returning. While there was interest, disagreements and rights disputes between Child's Play rights holders MGM and Child's Play/Chucky sequel rights holders Universal caused the project to be put into development hell and the series instead continued in direct-to-video format with Curse of Chucky for Unviersal's 1440 label. MGM began development of a Child's Play remake in 2018 with Polaroid director Lars Klevberg and video game writer Tyler Burton Smith of Sleeping Dogs and Quantum Break in his feature writing debut. The movie took a number of departures from the series prior entries such as removing the voodoo lore/fantasy elements and approaching the material in a manner more akin to a sci-fi thriller while still retaining the series trademark slasher elements. While Child's Play lacks the polish and novelty of its predecessor, this 2019 remake is a very strong film that goes at the same material from a new angle.Much like how the original Child's Play satirized consumer culture of the 1980s with its Good Guy dolls being thinly veiled analogs for similar toys like My Buddy or Cabbage Patch Kids, Child's Play 2019 updates itself for the digital age with Kaslan very much a satire of multinational conglomerates like Amazon and the massive integration of consumer technology where everything in our homes is talking to everything else. While the design of the Buddi doll isn't as much to my liking as the original film that seemed like it captured the look of 80s toys like Teddy Ruxpin or My Buddy, the Buddi doll has many of the issues with modern horror movies where much like the recent It adaptations they make the creature scary without considering the context surrounding it. Buddi is a consumer product and as a consumer product it's supposed to have a level of appeal, that's what made the original Child's Play work so well because the Good Guy doll started off relatively innocent looking (to a point) and it contrasted with the violent actions and eventual reveal. Buddi already looks pretty creepy from the outset and while it works for the horror sequences, it's presence during the initial scenes where he bonds with Andy were slightly more head titling.With that out of the way, the movie does have some solid work behind and in front of the camera. Lars Klevberg who directed the competent but forgettable Polaroid shows the same surehandedness here, but is allowed to experiment a bit more giving us a more diverse color pallete and some more ambitious camera work. While the neon lit look and primary focus on child protagonists does feel very in line with trying to capture the zeitgeist of Stranger Things, it's stil, a visually interesting look that works well with the material. Tyler Burton Smith also shows strong promise in his feature writing debut, taking the basic framework Don Mancini set in the original with a killer doll and Andy Barclay caught at the center of it but going a different direction by making Chucky an AI and taking inspiration from stuff like Dean Koontz Demon Seed or movies like Hider in the House or The Stepfather. Despite not being completely sold on Chucky's design, the character is written with a lot of pathos and you feel his confusion and sadness at being driven to be a ""friend to the end"" not understanding why what he did was wrong but also fear him as a credible antagonist.The cast is really strong too. Aubrey Plaza does a good job playing against type as a struggling single mom while retaining some of her deadpan comic style (though dialed back slightly) and it works to her advantage. Gabriel Bateman does well with his own take on Andy Barclay playing a character who hides himself in technology to distract himself from the real world and as seen from his work in the James Wan produced Lights Out, Bateman does quite well in this type of role. Brian Tyree Henry I also liked with his new take on the character of detective Mike Norris, playing the character with a nice level of humanity and humor as well as no nonsense seriousness when called for. Mark Hamil also does well in the role of Chucky playing the character as an obsessive overly friendly and enthused character with boundary issues who is driven only by attachment to his user. It's a really good performance for a single minded AI and despite running the risk of being one note Hamil gets all he can from it.Child's Play 2019 doesn't quite match up to the level of the '88 film, but it's an admirable attempt to tackle the material from a different angle keeping the consumer culture satire and slasher tropes while updating elements and characters to give them their own voice and identity. It's probably one of the best of the slasher remakes (especially in comparisons to the stuff made by Platinum Dunes) and offers a unique take on familiar settings and characters.",Child's Play

While the casting was really good,, the direction and cinematography left a lil bit to be desired. I still like it well enough,, but I wish they'd made it a bit creepier than they did. The kid who plays Andy is good, as well as his group of ""human' buddies. Aubrey Plaza!!! What can I say,, she's a joy!! Mark Hamill as the voice of Chucky was great,, but that's also part of the missed opportunity. He's done so much voice work, I expected more,, but that could very well have not been his call seeing as how he wasn't the director.Wacth it, or not,,,",Child's Play
79,hnt_dnl,People really liked this tedium?,2,15 July 2019,"Wow, after I slogged through this awful movie, I honestly was expecting a lot of negativity towards it. I thought it was slow, awkward and generally poorly acted. The director didn't seem to know what genre he was going for: cheesy horror, serious horror, or flat out comedy. The reason why the original film from 1988 worked was due to the supernatural possession element. That's the whole premise of Chucky. Take that away and you get this super cheap Black Mirror-esque movie with technology gone awry being the reason, thus taking away Chucky's personality. The one thing that makes the doll scary was removed! The reason for this particular doll going rogue felt like lazy writing. I couldn't stand the main kid actor who played Andy. I thought he was ingratiating and horrible with his smiling scared face and incessant heavy breathing. I just wanted him to shut up for most of this. Also, I really couldn't stand the cop's annoying mother with her cliché wisecracking humor and wanted her to shut up too. The doll looked hideous, more odd than scary and Andy basically knew the doll was a defective psycho way before he warned anyone about it, thereby being responsible for a lot of death. The comedy was incredibly unfunny. And it seemed like this movie had so many unnecessary and boring characters, including Andy's friends and that creepy stalker landlord. And the gore scenes didn't really work, all too long and drawn out just for the sake of ""tension"" and gory for the sake of gore. The only reason for the extra star is the combination of Aubrey Plaza as the Andy's mother and Brian Tyree Henry as the sympathetic cop who befriends Andy. If only Andy himself were actually tolerable at least I could look forward to 3 good characters going into the expected sequel. Guess I'll have to settle for 2.",Child's Play
80,Fernando-Rodrigues,Fresh and Funny,6,4 February 2021,"I loved Chucky's new design. I think that the technology element could've been explored in a more depressive way, showing how it makes people sick. But yet, the movie is fun and innovative.",Child's Play
81,rockman182,Child's Play (2019),6,1 July 2019,"First off, I need to let everyone know what a huge Child's Play/Chucky fan I am. I own three Good Guy dolls, the entire series of films and even t-shirt merchandise. I saw no purpose in a modern remake of Child's Play, especially when the Brad Douriff voiced franchise was still making films and doing decent for itself. Still the fanboy in me was going to check it out, especially since I heard some decent things about it. I liked moment's of this but didn't feel it. I know we shouldn't compare remakes and reboots with originals but this lacks what made the original Child's Play so special.The film is about a single mother and her son who bring a robotic Buddi doll into their house. The doll is a smart doll made by Kaslan Corporation, meaning the doll is able to control other appliances and is also operational via app. One doll is made without safety regulations by a disgruntled employee and Andy inherits this doll. He soon notices that the doll is off and also violent and extremely dangerous. Mark Hamill voices Chucky, which I thought was as good as a voice casting choice could get.Lets first talk about the design of the new Buddi Chucky. He looks bizarre, sometimes the effects don't look right. I can see how it could look off putting and creepy but to me it looked cartoonish and ugly. The voice work by Hamill was fine. The film had a campy, dark humor tone which was fine. A psycho doll coming to life is a silly concept so its natural. It doesn't use this well at many times. I wasn't sure Aubrey Plaza was a great choice as the mother because she didn't emote worry for her son's well being as well as say Catherine Hicks did.The film is much more violent than most of the Child's Play films which makes for fun but it lacks the intensity or thrill of the original film. Also, having a more millennial and pitfalls of technology stand point kills the aura of the magical/voodoo nature of the original story. There's not much that's special about this doll or this film in all honesty. A forgettable reboot that just didn't sit well with a die hard fan. I'll hold out for the upcoming Child's Pay series.6/10",Child's Play
82,RforFilm,This did...and the new Child's Play was fun and separates itself enough to make it it's own thing,8,25 June 2019,"It's been a strange weekend. This has to be the only time in which two toy-based movies have been released. One being the family friendly Toy Story 4 and the other being the horror comedy, Child's Play. The good news is that there's a crowd that's going to see one over the other. Where does Child's Play fall for me? Not too high. I've seen the original Child's Play and thought it was enjoyable, but no horror classic. Yes, I liked the story of a killer using voodoo to transfer his soul into a doll and goes on a killing spree. But again, it's about a killer doll. There's not a lot ""great"" you can do with it.I'm also aware of its large fan base (given all the sequels it's made, it's doing something right) and how much they like Chucky and his personality. I think it steams back to the fantasy of toys coming to life. A lot of toys can seem cute when your younger, but appear creepy when you look at it with adult eyes. This where the horror spin comes in and tries to have fun with it. Child's Play is another remake that tries to retell the story in a new light.Instead of voodoo magic and a serial killer, we have an A.I. robot. A computer company, Kaslan Industries, is about to launch it's new line of toys called the ""Buddi"" which learns according to it's owner. One owner is a young woman Karen (played by Aubrey Plaza) who works a minuscule retail job to try to give her son Andy (played by Gabriel Bateman) a normal life as possible. She gives one of the returned ""Buddi"" dolls to Andy for his birthday where they play around with what it can do and how it adapts based on his emotions.The more Andy plays with him the ""Buddi"" doll he names Chucky (played by Mark Hamill), the more Chucky appears to have a violent tendency. Chucky even grows jealous when Andy starts to play with other kids his own age. Things start to appear from dead cats, dead neighbors, and even human faces. Andy is aware of what's going on, but has no clue how to show it (would anyone believe you if you screamed about a killer toy). But now that Chucky is connected to several other Kaslan Industries products (other toys, computers, self driving cars, etc...), things may prove more dangerous then ever.While Child's Play was no classic, I too knew that a remake was going to be tough, given Chucky's cult status. The good news is that it's a rare remake that is both enjoyable and separates itself enough to make it it's own thing. Is it better then the original? That depends on what your looking for. First of all, making the toy an A.I. robot is both a pro and a con. The best thing about is that because of his connectivity to other systems, this allows for more creative kills and weapons to use on his victims.The negative is that Chucky isn't as scary as before. While the movie does a good job letting the toy learn for itself and eventually develop into the personality of a killer, it's still a robot. One of the reasons Brad Dourif was terrifying and funny was because as a doll that had the soul of another person, that gave it a personality that was still human. Mark Hamill, though giving it his all with another chilling voice, is limited by the range as he's playing a robot. It's only scary as long as you know he can only kill. I find it scarier when it kills because he enjoys it for his reasons and not because the programing is screwed up.What about the rest of the movie? I liked it. This knows right away that along with being a horror, this is a comedy. Any movie with Aubrey Plaza as a young mother would have to be a comedy. A lot of humor comes from her, her son and his new friends, and even with the commentary about technology becoming obsolete due to faster innovation and constant software updates.I'll give this eight new Chucky dolls out of ten. Child's Play did the right thing by trying it's hardest to separate itself from the original. It'll never be anything great (it's about a killer doll), but I had a good time. Fans of the original will probably like this fine. Just watch out for the eyes... it can look creepy...",Child's Play
83,fernandoschiavi,"A totally different product, the new film differs from the result of many current remakes, as it doesn't sustain itself on nostalgia and starts on its own path",6,11 July 2021,"The terror for the technological threat in this remake is greater than the classic fear of dolls, almost like in an episode of the ""Black Mirror"" series if it weren't for the mixture of so many different tones. Gradually the franchise had already embraced the morbid humor, especially from ""The Bride of Chucky"", thanks to the original voice of Brad Dourif, but well replaced here by Mark Hamill. The voice of the eternal Skywalker from ""Star Wars"" brings personality to the toy with a disturbing sound, alerting that the two Chuckies, new and old, are essentially two distinct characters. While Dourif's was angry and psychopathic, Hamill's is a ""newborn"" entity that is still learning to interact with humans, like a child who just wants to play or a pet eager to please its owner. This is where artificial intelligence is posed as a danger, as the wrong lessons can be learned (as in the sequence in which Andy enjoys watching ""The Chainsaw Massacre 2"" on television - a disturbing example of the Kuleshov effect in the ""education"" of the doll).One of the great differences of the new film in relation to the original and that puts it closer to the modern audience is the technological theme that is associated with Chucky. In the reboot, the doll does not come to life due to a voodoo ritual, but through a microchip that incites violent actions. Here, we see how adults line up to buy the dolls that promise to bring companionship to their children once connected to the internet. But of course that won't be all that beneficial, or this wouldn't be a horror movie. In fact, this possibility will lead to Chucky being able to control all kinds of electronic devices, with which modern society can hardly live without.The initial impact of this re-imagining of Child's Play is far from the genre appeal, which will eventually come. Tom Holland's original feature completes 30 years having created more than a franchise, but an iconography that is increasingly rare, introducing a character that is now legendary in cinema, but giving up a bias other than just entertaining - and that there isn't any problem in this choice. This version of Lars Klevberg in its opening sequence already points to a political possibility by alluding to xenophobia in its own conception, removing any supernatural element from the main character's nature, and replacing this key with a villainy focused on a Vietnamese character, the trigger of action and motivator of the growing horror on screen. A risky option that in 5 minutes puts the nature of the film's intentions into question; does the provocation need to go that far?But Klevberg seems willing to go further forever. Armed with the will to attack organizations from all walks of life that intend to globally invade society's life in the food, health, entertainment and technology sectors (mainly), the production of this new look at the emergence of Chucky - whose baptism results in a joke fabulous linked to her new voice actor, Mark Hammill - leans to fight the capitalist system from the first to the last minute, which even led to the birth of these conglomerates. The union of several vectors that are anchored by the company for which the doll is the poster boy and the main motivating element for expansion allows us to imagine our reality as enslaved to these companies, which literally are everywhere, control our lives and, as metaphorized in production, it can destroy our individuality at any time.The screenwriter Tyler Burton Smith hails from the video game industry and achieves an excellent portfolio in adapting ideas originally conceived by Don Mancini, exploring an expanding universe 30 years later and situating Chucky as an integral part of a force no longer supernatural, but just as dangerous. How much. Sharp dialogues, very delicate character construction and the right personal motivations make her script a differentiator within the current field of large-scale cinema, so little concerned with the basics of quality. The script here is not an event to be studied, but it puts into question the ability of the American film industry to produce entertainment with a minimum of care. It is impressive that each action committed in the film triggers reactions that are consistent and compatible with your need, without exaggeration and within a scenario of possible credibility.The narrative has two very calm first acts that introduce us to the complicated reality of Andy and his mother Karen, as well as the relationship with the stepfather Shane (David Lewis), a toxic and unpleasant man. It's on the arrival of the third act that everything takes on a more insane and frantic character of the kind we've seen in ""Child's Play 3"" and the other sequels, but they do it in a good way because they add action, horror and dark humor but without being inconsistent with what had been presented in the plot so far.In many ways we can say that the new version of Child's Play, written by Tyler Burton Smith (in his film debut) and directed by Lars Klevberg (Instant Death), is superior to its 1988 source, written by Don Mancini and directed by Tom Holland (The Hour of Amazement). The main one, in the development of the characters: be it in the friendship of the lonely young Andy (now older in the ways of Gabriel Bateman) with his only friend, the little robot owner of artificial intelligence Chucky (voice of Mark Hamill), or even in the relationship of the boy with his lost mother (Aubrey Plaza role). The entire juvenile cast also stands out, especially Beatrice Kitsos. Once again Bryan Tyree Henry shows unlimited talent and charisma, making his future in the industry clear. And if everyone in the cast, the direction and the script positively makes a difference, who should be the star of the movie is disappointing.Bigger problem is more serious, the new Chucky does more than have no empathy with the public; he commits the fatal sin of calling out to us for old Chucky at every scene, skidding exactly where he shouldn't and scratching a movie that could have gone beyond the original. The look of the new Chucky is bizarre and doesn't even remotely pass the awe we felt for the original. As for the physical recreation of the doll, the mechanical characteristics of the original were kept, but incredibly lacking movement and expression to reproduce the same bizarre threat. Despite having more technological resources, the youngest seems harmless next to Chucky from the previous films. However, in addition to paying homage to the 1988 assassin's attacks to please fans, the preference for knives and saws is still there, despite drones and autonomous cars being part of the new uninspired electronic arsenal.However, another hit is the metamorphosis that the title's toy undergoes, from a windup doll with three phrases recorded in its collection to an advanced and highly interactive technology, capable of controlling electronic devices in your home (such as TVs and utensils), as well as of drones, cars and all kinds of equipment online. It makes sense and leaves the plot more in touch with today - of children practically leaving the maternity hospital with their face stuck in a smartphone or tablet. In 2019, it is technological fear and its ills that raises the questions in the new guise. And just like that, comparisons with the Black Mirror series will be unavoidable. But the main issue concerns more what was raised by director Steven Spielberg in his Artificial Intelligence (2001). Will conscious artificial beings be considered alive? And will they have the same human rights?Child's Play still succeeds in making a very intimate film, where most of the events take place, or Andy's apartment, where Buddi ends up using the connectivity of the products that the company that created him has, or in the megastore, where the final clash with the demonic doll happens. So, halfway through, the film gives us some fun jump scares, from the most shameless to some more violent ones, where the production embraces the gore side there for the final moments, in a very funny way.Directed by Swedish rookie Lars Klevberg, the production is not ashamed to show all the gore in its prime. Yes, guts and waterfalls of blood are constant - the highlight is a scene with a woodworking saw, where Chucky masterfully shows all his technological potential. This is sure to please fans fonder of the gore grip of terror. His direction was a big hit, the director guides Chucky's evolution and the growing element of danger around Andy, Mike and Karen well and even with the abrupt and even colossal changes between the second and third acts, it all sounds a bit fluidity as the film walks through horror, black humor and science fiction. One of the biggest problems in the film is an indecision of its own genre. Packed with really violent deaths - and living up to the 16+ censorship - the new version can be classified as horror-comedy, and despite struggling to maintain this energy, it fails to find real depth in both genres and ends up delivering a long one neither too violent nor too funny. Also, the film falls into the Black Mirror fashion trap, thinking the technology would be more frightening than the reincarnation of a psychopath (as in the '88 feature).While stylistic confusion and superficiality detract from the new version of Child's Play, this is balanced by the fact that the film has no aspirations to match the original. A totally different product, the new feature differs from the result of many current remakes, as it doesn't sustain itself on nostalgia and starts on its own path, with merit in the lack of commitment and resulting in a simply fun pastime.",Child's Play

93,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10),5,13 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Being a big fan of the original, I went into this one with some trepidation. I was happy to see a potentially good reboot of the franchise, but I was also critical. The only way to really be fair about this movie is to go in with an open mind and judge the movie for itself and try to resist the impulse to compare it to the 1988 classic.It is Andy Barclay's 13th birthday, and his Mom decides to get him a Buddi Doll. At first, Andy is reserved, but seeing how the doll will do whatever you tell it to do, he and his newfound friends take advantage of the doll for some cheap laughs. The doll, however, develops a love for Andy and a longing for his approval. Unknown to them all, the doll was allowed to have homicidal tendencies from an unstable factory worker the day it was created. It soon becomes overly protective to the point that if anyone gets in the way, they wind up dead. But when Andy's Mom becomes Chucky's next target, Andy is forced into a life and death confrontation.After watching this one, I have mixed feelings. Andy is no longer the helpless, scared little 6-year-old boy, he is a teenager now. His Mom is no longer the perfect parent, but she is very flawed and in a relationship with a real jerk. Chucky himself is no longer possessed. It is just a doll with homicidal tendencies that has become obsessed and overly attached to Andy. The movie was very different from the original. I honestly tried not to compare the two, but in this case, that is almost impossible.It is well produced, well acted and the doll effects were very good. But, I still just felt that overall, it was just okay. It is shades lower than the original and not nearly as good. The story is weaker and not really that interesting. Even though I really love that Mark Hamill voiced Chucky in this one, he was nowhere near as fun as Brad Dourif. I guess some movies just shouldn't be remade, and this is probably one of those.",Child's Play

96,phenomynouss,"meanspirited and miserable, none of the fun of the other Chucky movies",1,21 March 2020,"Right from the very start, this movie deviates from Chucky ""lore"" in such a way that it feels less like a reboot or a remake and more like an original story that was already fully written by the time the decision was made to convert it into a Chucky-themed movie.Rather than being a voodoo soul swap of a serial killer, the Chucky doll here is completely AI, which has inexplicably been programmed to be violent and dangerous, with safety protocols coded in AFTER the fact that are removed by a vindictive programmer just for one of the dolls.As such, all of Mark Hamill's lines are essentially done in the semi-lifeless style of a simple movie robot. He's essentially Chappie if Chappie was made to watch horror movies and play board games all day. Hamill barely gets any opportunity to give any sort of life or energy to his performance and thus is thoroughly wasted.
As for the film itself, it has none of the fun of any of the other Chucky movies, and it has none of the chemistry among the kids the way ""IT"" 2017 did. The kill scenes are as far removed from the tongue-in-cheek style of the other Chucky movies, and are in some cases so gruesome and explicit, without anything remotely resembling levity or fun that it comes across as gross and meanspirited.
The film doesn't go so far as to break that unspoken rule of mainstream slasher films ""don't kill kids"", but it does indulge in a needlessly brutal and miserable scene in which a man's cut throat sprays a 5 year old girl in the face with copious amounts of blood.
Nothing about this film is fun, stylish, scary, or even particularly compelling in any sort of way. It just is what it is and takes no pride or pleasure in it.",Child's Play
97,statuskuo,"Brutal Reboot, Passes, But Just Barely",6,26 June 2019,"If it weren't for the adorably dead eyed Aubrey Plaza and the deadpan Bryan Tyree, this movie would be intolerable. The kids, named Pug and Fallon are...inexplicably living in an apartment complex that shows neither parents. In fact, the whole complex is inexplicably big. But whatever...the point is...
Chucky. I was never a fan of Brad Dourif. I get it, he coined the joyous maniacal original. But...he also was responsible for making the nearly unwatchable sequels. This duty was taken over by Mark Hamill. Which does a pretty decent Brad Douriff. Anyway, the set up is, about the same, except for the spiritual serial killer angle (to which I know a lot of purists will miss). This is something different, and may nag you with a question as to whether or not his uncontrollability is easily fixed with...um..water.
Okay, that said, the kid who plays Andy is annoying. Not sure why he gets on my nerves other than he can't stop screaming in order to calmly explain the things he is seeing. I guarantee the Bryan Tyree's character would take him seriously. He seems like a man who follows any crime. A law dog who still cares about law. In fact, he offers Andy many opportunities to do so. That may be a script/directing issue than the kid.
Also, and SPOILER,
this movie isn't afraid to kill an elderly Black woman. I expect a few kids, but...really? Pretty gutsy.
Aubrey Plaza does a great job playing a young mother who seems to be more of a friend than an adult. Very rare seeing this dynamic. But she tries hard at a job she hates. Does it matter about the father? A little. We sense he died, otherwise we most likely would hear from him. She is also a broken toy, relegated to dating men who are scumbags. That is youth raising youth.
Other than that, a valiant effort to capture the spirit of the original. A few things that stood out... a cop car at the end has a nice nod to ""RoboCop"" which asks a similar question about sentient robots and man.
Here's the thing...if you can't get past the cold open, which sets up how Chucky came to be...you should probably leave the theater.",Child's Play
98,kaefab,a total flop the 1988 Child's play can rest now,3,24 June 2019,"This movie you would call a remake, is one of the weakest i have ever seen.First they remove the element that made Chunky so great, a doll who is possessed by the spirit of a criminal well versed in the occult. That was fantastic and they been running the franchise on this one from the start.So instead of going with this angle we get feeded a Japanese company to fabric the dolls, a bullying manager who bullies is employ around, one freaks out and removes all protection on this so call doll that now apparently can control all household appliances. WOW talk about a push over.From then on the movie was pretty dead for me and i literately lost all interest. I need to point out that i love Aubrey Plaza she is hilarious in pretty much all her movies and very very easy on the eyes but in this one she just does not fit in.There is a small amount of kills and gore, and this is well made, but for the rest this movie suffers from so many things.Lets hope that this is the last of chunky we will see for many years cause this franchise as been ruined down to the ground.",Child's Play

At times I felt sorry for Chucky. Was I supposed to? I don't know, but that emotion took away from the fact it's a horror film (not all the time, but there was times where this was the case).
I get that the doll was AI, but it could do things so out the ordinary that it just didn't make sense whatsoever.
Plot at times felt a bit jumpy and a bit loose.
Wasn't as scary as I was expecting.But having said that, I quite enjoyed it. It had a good amount of gore in it and different ways to die. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. Some of the characters were likeable and the ending was good. In all honesty I didn't expect much from this film, but it was just an easy to follow horror film.",Child's Play

Second, the acting is pretty bad. You don't care about any character.
So, overall just an OK B-horror movie. Go for the original one instead.",Child's Play

102,baileycrawly,"Oh, My....",2,26 October 2019,"Brad Dourif: a charismatic character actor who single-handedly brought one of the world's favorite satanic dolls to life with his trademark laugh, his quick wit, and the delight in his voice when his character is performing his favorite activity: killing.
Mark Hamill: none of those things.Swapping out the voodoo elements for an AI doll really destroys a lot of the plot of the film for me. The original Chucky was powered by a supernatural spirit, therefore not confined to the laws of logic. This is a defective AI doll, pull the batteries out of it; there's nothing it can do to come back to life once it's dead.
Chucky was notoriously funny and with a lot of personality. it's one of the reasons why so many people have bought the films over the years and fallen in love with the doll. This doll is lacking that almost entirely, and the film suffers greatly as a whole. Hamill's Chucky isn't scary, intimidating or in the least bit worthy to be considered a re-imagining of the original doll.
If there's one saving grace in this film, it's Gabriel Bateman's Andy Barclay who, although nothing like the Andy we've come to know and love from the original franchise, made a pretty good portrayal of the character he was given.Overall, this is a pretty standard, run-of-the-mill remake, churned out as a result of copyright law rather than inspiration, slapped together to make a few easy dollars off the back of the franchise. Is it worth watching? I think it's worth a viewing or two, but ultimately at the end of the day it falls flatter than Seed of Chucky and is even more irrelevant and forgettable as a film.",Child's Play

She was listed as the lead in this horror film. I was excited to see her naked. Well, she didn't get naked, and she really wasn't the lead. As a matter of fact, she should have started at third billing (behind Mark Hamill and the little boy) and been pushed back another couple spots for not being naked in the film. Hey dummies, it's a remake of bad 1980's horror - we want female nudity.As far as the content, it was a cool idea for a 'Child's Play' (1988) remake, but it starts to feel like the 'Goonies' (1985). About halfway through the film, it pivots to an underage teen drama - like it wants to capture that 'Stranger Things' (2016) audience. Stupid. There were clever updates to modernize the content for 2019 - Chucky is a 'smart doll' that can connect online (like a 'Google Home Assistant' device) and control your house while it babysits your kid - basically, the future of both childcare and eldercare (this is already happening in Japan with senior citizens). I really enjoyed the first 45 minutes or so... Then, the fat kid from ""Goonies' shows up and I was all like ""Damn, this movie just jumped the shark...""All things considered, this film inspired me to re-watch the original, as well as 'Curse Of Chucky' (2013).

Seriously!Second, the storyline is ridiculous! I have never seen the original Chucky but it was my understanding that the doll was possessed. This doll is not possessed. We are supposed to believe that it's a robot that got out of control because some guy working in manufacturing decided to remove some restrictions codes. Really? Please! No way in hell that a robot could do all that! This doll could analyze human behavior, move faster than a cat (please!), has surgical skills good enough to know how to remove a human face and put it on a watermelon (again, please!), has some serious hacking skills that allows it to control lots of other devices and move around freely everywhere it wants too without anyone stopping it. It is so unrealistic and so over the top that instead of being scary it's ridiculous! Also, The acting was bad and not because the actors are bad but because they just couldn't sell it. I actually felt bad for them. Did they signed up for this movie without reading the script? Were they having money troubles? Seriously, how you end so low? It's sad really.

110,mwilson1976,Chucky for millenials in a high tech horror romp,5,15 April 2020,"More of a reboot than a remake, director Lars Klevberg offers an anti corporate / anti consumerist take on the 1988 original, in a story which writer Tyler Burton Smith says was heavily inspired by Spielberg's E.T. A family are terrorised by a malevolent high tech Buddi doll called Chucky (voiced by Luke Skywalker himself Mark Hamill), who is basically an Alexa device gone rogue, killing off characters and the family cat in various gory ways before going berserk on shoppers in a department store. It's a very self aware and smug take on the killer doll concept that downplays the horror in favour of humour and satire. The movie was promoted with a poster campaign that featured Chucky killing off characters from the Toy Story franchise, as it was released at the same time with Toy Story 4.",Child's Play
111,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""Child's Play"" (2019)",7,26 June 2019,"""Child's Play"" (2019) actually surprised me by being a little more ambitious and well rounded than the typical reboot of an 80's slasher franchise. Screenwriter Tyler Burton Smith tries to present audiences with a fresh, updated horror film with funny, engaging, likable characters. And he mostly succeeds - it helps that the cast is roundly quite good in their roles. (The voice of Chucky is none other than Mark Hamill.) There is some discomfiting dark humor here, too, that makes for some great, guilty fun.But this ""Child's Play"" is doomed to suffer in comparison to the 1988 original. The very first ""Child's Play"" was a particularly scary film, even if its sequels were much less so; I remember people screaming in the theater when I saw it with my high school friends. This new movie doesn't come close to matching it in that manner.Smith's update abandons the admittedly campy premise of the original, in which a serial killer employs voodoo to transfer his soul into an interactive doll. Smith gives us something that is more plausible - a malfunctioning A.I. that turns homicidal partly because its programming leads it to. His take is interesting ... Chucky is even a little sympathetic at first - he's a childlike, vaguely cute robot, and his mischievous young owner is at least partly responsible for his early, less frightening transgressions.This all works on a certain level. It's smarter than its 80's source material. It might have been gold if it had been fleshed out by a science fiction screenwriting master like Charlie Brooker, of ""Black Mirror"" fame. Or, better yet, why not the writers for HBO's brilliant ""Westworld,"" which proceeds from essentially the same basic story concept?Alas, we can't have our cake and eat it too, at least in this case. The new Chucky is a more intelligent story concept but a less menacing bogeyman. He just can't hold a candle to the voodoo-infused, sociopathic demon-doll voiced by the legendary Brad Dourif so long ago. The new ""Child's Play"" isn't quite scary enough for our expectations, and that's a serious criticism for a horror movie.All things considered, I'd rate this a 7 out of 10.",Child's Play

I don't know if director wanted it but the movie is sort of black comedy/ slasher movie.Movie was not scary as the original but it was tense. The concept of modern doll doing weird things due to wrong programming is new take on doll doing weird things after being possessed by a spirit. Well, they tried their best to show the new concept but the execution could have been a little bit better.Many original movie's fan are not loving this movie saying that it's modern concept was bad and movie was not scary. I agree movie was not scary but seeing that it was a reboot and had nothing to do with the previous running franchise, it was a good try. Atleast they tried something new instead of copying same old story. For original franchise fans, a tv series continuing story of cult of chucky and 9th part is also confirmed, so you can consider that this reboot is story of other universe.Overall, I would recommend it to everyone even Child's Play fans who didn't watch it.",Child's Play
115,jamiedarlow-37510,Surprisingly inventive and purposeful remake!,9,3 April 2020,"Modernising the original Child's Play (1988) with a sharp eye on technology and the creepiness that can be explored there, a mother (Aubrey Plaza) wants to treat her son (Gabriel Bateman) to a Buddi doll on his birthday. The Buddi doll is a hyper intelligent doll that can responds to all your commands and even have a fully fledged conversation with you. This particular one likes to call itself Chucky and will do anything for his friend. Even murder. I was really surprised at how well this reboot was done and its key ingredient is making Chucky a character that you actually feel for. This has never really happened before in the series; of course he's a great iconic evil character, a serial killer whose soul is transported into a child's doll, but as darkly hilarious as he is, you never feel sorry for him. Here, Mark Hamill provides the voice and it's a much different performance to Brad Dourifs while also being perfect in its own way. Here there's no supernatural elements; instead there's manufactural glitches to make Chucky how he is. That may sounds a bit lame but it's actually a really clever origin story and one in which Chucky has good intentions but is troubled by life's cruel edges. One of the most effective sequences is when Andy and his friends are watching a Texas Chainsaw movie; Chucky is watching hesitantly and clearly disturbed by what he is seeing and the joyful reaction his best friend is having to the violence. He is seeing everything for the first time and he takes a sadistic message from it. The performances are all round great; it's great to see Plaza in more roles since her smaller role in Judd Apatow's Funny People (2009), Bateman is one of the most impressive young actors I've seen in a while on screen and plenty of funny supporting performances from Carlease Burke and Brian Tyree Henry to name a couple. Despite its more moving dramatic core, it stills keeps the dark humour intact thankfully",Child's Play

director:Lars Klevberg
starring: Mark Hamill,Aubrey Plaze,Gabriel Batemen, Bryan tyrene Henry etcoverall rating 73/100Childs play was a fun movie and kept me pretty much consistently entertained despite its flaws which are sometimes unintentional lets talk about this.First of all lets start of with i loved how they modernised the character of Chucky and his character design was fantastically creepy. I loved how instead of someones spirit going inside chucky he was an actual malfunctioned robot that was pretty much a more creepy looking alexa. The studio definitely got it right this time in there modernisation of this character. Also chucky ms character design was very creepy. This was largely helped by Mark hamills fantastically creepy voice acting. But there was just something very disturbing about his almost plastic looking face and flashing red eyes that really made you pay all of your attention to his character.Next the film had solid acting and fantastic voice acting from Mark Hamill.
I think what made chucky the most scary was his voice it was disturbingly well done by mark hamill the way he manipulated all the characters and the way he treated everyone as his toys really added for a entertaining film and chucky was the thing that held this film togethet. I do also have to give credit though to Gabriel Bateman who showed a surprising amount of versatility in his acting considering his young age he really played the lonely isolated child who was in desperate need of friendship. Aubrey Plaza also did a solid job at playing Andys struggling mum who has trouble bonding with her son. Brian tyree Henry and carlease burke and Beatriss Kitsos were other standouts as well.However the film did have some pacing issues. The beginning of the film was very slow and clunky in places this was mostly due to the film exploring Andys relationship with chucky and his relationship with his mum. This was fine but chucky did not really go mad until a good 60% through the film so it felt like they had to suddenly turn it up by 100 in the last 30-45 minutes or so which they did but they had to work for it.Further developing on my previous point but in a positive light the film did have excellent narrative character development between Andy and his mum and also Chucky and Andy. I loved seeing Andy and his mums relationship growing from not being able to connect with each other largely due to her relationship with Shane ( David Lewis) but as the film progressed there relationship grew strong and Andys mum would do anything to protect him which was such a nice development to see. And also It was interesting to see the character development between Andy and Chucky. Now chucky turned into this friend that Andy needed so badly due to him being isolated from other people it really made him come out of his shell so his was nice until chucky liked Andy a bit to much and tried to kill everyone he knows.However the film did have a fair few predictable jumpscares. Now some landed as you genuinely did not expect chucky to jump or scare someone. But overall you could tell when a jumpscare was going to happen due to the soundtrack and camera angels with props positioned so you could not see chucky it just made it less effective as you could expect it other horrors are either very clever or unexpected unfortunately this film largely had neither.Also my final two negatives for Childs play would firstly be that there was some incredibly dislikeable characters. Firstly shane was cheating on his wife with Andys mum which made you hate him and there was pretty much a paedo who put up cameras to spy on Andys mum. This made there deaths by Chucky good and i wanted to see them killed off. This is bad because you want Chuckys victims to be innocent therefore there deaths have more impact like with Mikes mum but these were people who were dicks. And finally the film had bad tonal issues. The film was unsure about how far it should of went with its comedy so it kind of made me laugh to much when it shouldnt of done especially with the death scenes and chuckys interesting facial expressions i think this effected the film slightly as its hard to take seriously.However ending with my final two positives firstly despite it being overused the film had a surprisingly funny script. The most humour for me came from Detective Mike and his mum. There mother and son relationship was very funny to watch as they both bounced off insults with each other but yet still having a sweet relationship. And chucky was also put into a lot of funny situations by repeating bad language or pulling funny faces. And finally the deaths in the film despite sometimes being very gory were very entertaining and unique. Having peoples head shredded by a lawnmower and falling on razor blades even drones with sharp blades spinning around the film had very unique ways of creating these death sequences that were fun and gruesome to watch.Overall despite being flawed with things that they perhaps should of thought more deeply about before releasing this childs play is a fun horror/slasher that is worth your time despite you maybe not taking it seriously.",Child's Play
118,msunando,Artificial intelligence gone wrong,6,22 June 2019,"Child's Play - if you are a fan of the original one released in 1988 and enjoy the horror genre, then you undoubtedly will watch Child's Play and comparisons are inevitable. Well for starters, this one is not based on a serial killer's ghost having possessed a toy, but artificial intelligence having gone wrong. When Karen Barclay (Aubrey Plaza) gifts her young son Andy (Gabriel Bateman) the toy robot Buddi, little does she know that a disturbed employee at the manufacturing unit in Vietnam messed up all its control filters in the chip. Consequently, Buddi starts developing violent streaks as it has a penchant for the sharp objects and sympathises with his newfound best friend Andy, who doesn't like her mother's boyfriend one bit. Here's where things start going out of control and corpses start appearing regularly.For the positives, there's no ghost or exorcism, and the film remains focused on horror, not deviating from the storytelling with unnecessary subplots. But Child's Play doesn't really rise to being laudable in generating chills as it becomes quite predictable and only manages periodic shocks and an occasional squeal. There's also excessive blood and gore. Director Lars Klevberg, being an experienced director of photography actually, focuses more on VFX and a sharp cinematic effect, and the resulting gloss is undisputed. I must admit that science going wrong isn't as exciting as the depths of the unknown spirits.",Child's Play
119,gustheaffen,Better than the original,9,14 June 2020,I was never much of a fan of the original and the demonic doll. This actually has a more realistic premise given technology.

120,Rendanlovell,Ugh,2,16 July 2020,"The look of the original Chucky is iconic and shouldn't be tampered with. Especially since Child's play movies are still being made. Cult of Chucky isn't even 5 years old and yet, now we get a remake of the original Childs Play. From the get go this remake is significantly worse. Modernized and less ""cheesy"" but still, much worse. Here, chucky is a tech doll that can patch into wifi connected devices. Instead of a magic man infusing his evil soul into the doll, the doll is just evil because. A random worker simply disabled his safe guards and that made him evil. Lame. Then there's the issue of the characters. Which are all unlikable except for the detective guy. Everyone else is either incredibly obnoxious or terribly acted. Which is mostly the fault of the writing. The dialogue is atrocious and the structure is incredibly stupid. Chucky literally learns to be evil because he watched a horror movie one time and the main kid got mad at him. How reductive and cliche. The most tedious part, of course, is the story. Aside from the ridiculous chucky set up, there's a variety of subplots and characters that utterly suck. There's a bizzare sub plot involving a mcguffin present that goes on forever. There's a Ten Cent Jack Black that creeps on Aubrey Plaza, and that's it. There's Aubrey Plazas boyfriend who is just unruly, and that's it. What is this script? With all that out of the way lets finally address chucky himself. Visually, it's slop. Vomit inducing even. The old chucky look is iconic, this is a rubbery nightmare, and not in a good way. I like Mark Hamill as the voice actor but, also, Brad Dourif is still around. Who is the only person who should be playing chucky. He brings both a vulnerability and maniacal life to chucky. This brings out some wonderfully crude but hilarious moments. The remake is completely the opposite. It takes itself so completely serious that any chance at entertainment outside of some gore is wasted. I think the perfect tone for this type of movie is campy but straight faced. Like a Tremors or, I don't know, the original Childs Play. Don't be as serious as this but don't be as goofy as the the sequels and you've got something fun. Those have their own charms of course, which I love, but that's not an option for this movie. In my opinion, there are campy moments here, it's just overshadowed by the constant music stings and loud score. Simply, it's a sloppy mess. The direction is surprisingly solid and there are some striking shots. That's about it.",Child's Play

This reboot is directed by Polaroid's director Lars Klevber.In the film, the young mother Karen Barclay (Aubrey Plaza) has bought a new modern Buddi doll named Chucky (voice of Mark Hamill) for her son Andy (Gabriel Bateman). This technical doll can help in the household and also serve as a friend for Andy.
When Andy learns that his Buddi doll is different compared to the other dolls in the series, he decides to use the doll for his own entertainment and becomes good friends with it.
When Andy later learns that the people he hates have been attacked by an unknown person, he starts to suspect Chucky, but no one believes a doll can attack people and Andy is seen as a suspect.In addition to this film, the original Child's Play film series and creators are also working on their films. They are furthermore separate from this new film. Despite this, they have put this reboot in a modern twist, which means that the film responds well to the current techniques and associated lifestyle of the people. In this film, Chucky is connected to the internet and can do what he is asked to do for the characters, just like he can with a Smartphone.
For fans of the original Child's Play series, this may take some getting used to and maybe even appear less entertaining. For people who are not interested in the Chucky film series, this new film can come across as entertaining. This film is also more of a dark comedy than a real horror film. Chucky's victims are killed by the doll in an overly bloody way, but many of these actions have been brought forward in a somewhat comical way.The Chucky doll was brought into the film with robot versions and further with normal dolls. This is how the doll and its dark activities come across as realistic. The only thing they've used CGI for is to provide Chucky with different emotions on his face. Unfortunately, there is a bit more to see that this was done with CGI in the film.The acting is done well in the film. Aubrey Plaza appears good and realistic as a young mother with financial problems, who does everything to be there for her son. Gabriel Bateman is also doing well in the film for a young actor. In this film he also knows how to play the leading role. Together with Aubrey Plaza he has a nice chemistry and they look credible as mother and son. With this film it is also the first time that Brad Dourif does not speak in Chucky. Fortunately, with Mark Hamill, they cast a good replacement actor to set the Chucky role in a darkly comical way.",Child's Play

Soon the doll becomes some kind of a guardian for Andy and wants to kill everyone who thinks might be unwelcome in his house.I don't remember the original version but this one is really bad because of the upgrades brought to the doll with the terminator eyes the voice and the references on 2pac witch was unnecessary, we were supposed to laugh on the scene or what? Also the cursing the fight between kids, verbal abuse to a child, that gore is in fact not horror but cringe worthy.My opinion is that this remake is a total failure and it should not be made at all.",Child's Play

The original film tries to be scary but comes off as a bit of a joke. This one however didn't take itself too seriously, and it worked really well as a comedy horror. The main kid is a great actor, supporting cast did a good job, especially the other kids. I don't like the new version of the Chucky doll, I prefer the old one but that's irrelevant. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Much better concept as well, glad they took out the storyline of the doll being cursed which was silly.",Child's Play

I buy a possesed doll. (as stupid as that sounds). These types of dolls run on battery power or pluggin them into a port station. There is down time during which the doll can be destroyed!!Lastly these are some of the reasons why the film only made 27 million on a film budget of 10 million. Also figure in marketing expensives ... at least 25 million. So the film lost money at the end of the day.The last word... Mark Hamill? Really?

The only reason I went to watch this remake is to see a different approach to chucky and compare it to the original.
as I was afraid they don't do them like they used to do them decades ago.
ok....so the movie has a few laughs and last 30 minutes were good but in first hour u get bored. there are no killings no blood no gore and u get a different chucky this time with no real explanation as how that doll became evil doll. no scenario about that. no cause as how the doll named itself chucky.
if u grew up with the original movies u can check it out to see the huge quality difference the old movies had compared to this one.
there is no brad dourf.....no manchini......it sucks compared to the original. still it has it's moments to keep the doll in fashion until the new series are out.
so check it out but at the end don't buy it...ignore it....and wait the real sequel series to come out.
that's my advise.Grade // C",Child's Play

The doll is updated for the new generation with ideas taken from the likes of Alexa and Google Home which I thought was a nice idea as oppose to staying closer to the original. The new design of the doll lets the film down a little in my opinion, don't get me wrong in parts it looks great - like when it sits in Andys room in the dark with its glowing red eyes - super creepy! But in other scenes it looks a little goofy, especially when Chucky smiles. I love the ending of the film too, I hope they make another.

133,zac-04879,The New and Improved Chucky,8,1 November 2021,"Lars Klevberg's reboot of the killer-doll classic is a ripe and successful attempt to bring Chucky back to his sober self. There's gratefully none of the stupid 'Bride' or 'Seed' of Chucky garbage, also known as the points that started significantly ruining the franchise. However, there certainly is a fair handful of fun that's additionally dropped in. Without going over the edge like Bride of Chucky did, this reboot creates noticeable sparks of humour and delivers an agreeable concept.The plot centres on the doll's messed up computer system rather than diving right back down with the original serial-killer-possession. Now 2019's Child's Play is fresh, new and very much improved. Starting off fresh, there's a fun new cast including Gabriel Bateman, Mark Hamill, Aubrey Plaza and Brian Tyree Henry. The performances are forgettably average, but still manage to work out.If it weren't for screenwriter Tyler Burton Smith presenting us a fixed and improved plot, we'd still be stuck with the dull and flat Chucky movies. What also increases the film's sense of ripeness is also the brilliant direction, plus the fact that it's very appealing and is constantly entertaining. Alike most horror movies, there's a lack of true energy within the climax, which is thankfully just forgettable. Although it's also not very scary, it's one of the most underrated horror films of the year.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Child's Play

This Buddi/ Chucky Doll looks like a deranged, red headed Christopher Walken doll with Hollywood plastic surgery. I couldn't believe how bad the doll looked. There's also no back story, it feels like the entire movie is an intro to the actual movie because the plot is so thin. Why is this something I have to keep repeating for horror movies now?

It's nothing like them and as your not a child anymore, it won't even make you jump. No real gore or frights to see either. It's just another ""that'll do"" movie spat out with an old label in the hopes of cashing in.. It doesn't even give you any feelings of nostalgia because other than the fact its a doll called chucky, it shares nothing else with the originals. I'm sure it'll spawn many more sequels and spin offs because it did ok at the box office. In short if you want a horror with a good plot, good characters and plenty of scares and kills then avoid this.. If you want to watch a CGI doll plod about and have the occasional jump scare then this will do... Just dont expect to see the chucky that scared you as a child..

So yea a disgruntled assembly line worker gets fired, but has to complete one more Buddi doll. LOL. Yea he's not just gonna walk out the door after being fired.

We know A.I. is going to kill us all, and people are totally attached to their phones, disconnecting from society while connecting on here instead, but did you have to call it Child's Play and taint the original?

I really enjoyed this film its an interesting new direction for this franchise and I like the new tone and take on the lore of Chucky.The idea of having Chucky be an AI that has malfunctioned was a brilliant idea in my opinion and really like the idea of Chucky believing he is doing the right thing and believes he is doing this all to help his Friendship with Andy.
The friendship between them is more fleshed out as well.The kills are great and can be quite effective. However most of them do guy away which kinda dissapointing but still very cool to watch most of them.The design of Chucky is amazing and I think really suits this new direction they are going for and Mark Hamill does an amazing job with the voice acting.
I also really like the idea of Chucky being able to control electronics.This is honestly a remake I prefer over the original it's an interesting idea that I prefer and a great new direction that this franchise needs.
I will however say there some annoying moments some annoying characters and it never explains how Chucky can control the bears in the third act.There are some really dark moments with Chucky when he is really creepy for example when he's killed the cat and he's in the room making the cat noises that is so dark and scary and greats a dark atmosphere that really works for the movie.Verdict 9.2/10 great film and a great Reboot love the new direction and new tone for the franchise this a great version of the Childs Play story.",Child's Play

145,AdrenalinDragon,Child's Bore,4,2 July 2019,"What the hell have they done with Child's Play? This reboot was so lame! Chucky is now a really boring doll with no wit or personality to him. He's just a basic robot who follows orders or tries to pretend to be good, but falls flat on
its face. Why did they change the look of Chucky too? Only thing going for him is Mark Hamill's voice performance, but that's it. As for the other characters, does anybody really care? The Andy ""kid"" here has nothing going for him and he's way too old to care about wanting a doll. I thought the mother character was awful in this one and just plain annoying, as well as her boyfriend. The other friends joining in also dragged things down even further with bad performances.The writing was just all over the place. Nothing made any sense and it really felt like different scripts stitched together to make a feature length movie. Nobody seems to work out the obvious that Chucky is evil and things just happen because they need to happen for no reason I guess? What about the kills? There's a few gory deaths but nothing really stood out as all that memorable honestly. The one-liners and dialogue was weak and stupid, the finale was also ridiculous and felt like they ran out of money trying to build up to something bigger than what it actually was. It's a shame because the concept of technology for the reboot had potential, but the execution was so piss-poor and lackluster it wasn't really all that entertaining to watch in the long run at all.Another problem I had with this new Child's Play was its tone. Was it supposed to be serious or a Comedy? I don't know, but if it was supposed to be funny I wasn't really laughing all that much. With Chucky being the weakest character here and usually the highlight of all the Child's Play movies, this is a serious problem. Why would we root for anybody else if nobody has any character
development or any good motives for us to care? I honestly was bored throughout good chunks of this movie. Stick with the originals!3.5/10",Child's Play

150,Otkon,It was serviceable. But it wasn't Child's Play.,5,22 July 2019,"The producers just wanted to cash in on the franchise's name and nostalgia. But the movie as a whole could have just been made on its own.This movie doesn't really say anything new. We get it. Technology has been bad since Frankenstein and his monster. Someone set the doll to ""evil"". It got stabby. The kids thought it was funny at first. They even cutely tried to conceal its felonious face-flaying mayhem. Har-har. Then they moronically smash the stupid thing instead of running to the white hats and the media with proof that a money-grubbing sleazeball corporation with mistreated third-world employees - for some reason - programs their toys with the militaristic option to maim and murder. Bright move, you little enabling sociopaths. Goodbye, Pulitzer.The point of the proper and rightful Chucky wasn't soulless gadgets gone rampant. There is no inherent terror in that. But a Satanic serial killer transferring his immortal essence into an innocent poppet aimed at a vulnerable, fatherless young boy - that made the original into a brilliant parable of a commercial patriarchy run amok, a play on the 80's indictment of non-nuclear families.This new movie was okay. The cast was competent. The story was nothing thoughtful. Some of the gore was inventive. But honestly, it could have called Malfunctioning Electronic Doll.There is a reason that true Chucky, and even Tiffany, are iconic.

153,RhapsodyReviews,Better Than I Thought.,6,7 October 2019,"Review:
'Child's Play' is an American horror film directed by Lars Klevberg. The movie had a lot of elements stacked against it, the biggest one being that it's a remake of an already cheesy 1988 horror film of the dame name. Another is the fact that they got rid of the possession element all together. Chucky is not a doll that gets possessed by a serial killer in this movie. Instead they made it more modern and it as a doll with all its safety features taken offline and as it learns it becomes more human but in a psychotic way. I don't always get why Chucky does what he does, but often he has a reason that makes sense if seen through his eyes.
We start off in a toy factory in a foreign country, if I had to guess I would say Korea, but I don't remember if it said or not. Anyway, we see an employee getting fired and physically abused by his employer. The employee than takes the 'Buddi' doll he was working on and disables all its safety features causing it to act on its own. The doll eventually ends up in the possession on Andy and his mom (Gabriel Bateman and Aubrey Plaza). We see a nice montage of Anndy playing with the doll who he named Han Solo, but the doll insisted on Chucky. I get why they put that in there as an Easter Egg for 'Star Wars' fans since the doll is voiced by Mark Hamill who played Luke Skywalker in the franchise. I didn't think it was needed, but it was quick and didn't take away form the story. After we see Andy and Chucky get close, Chucky starts to see people around Andy don't treat him the way he feels he should be treated. So, Chucky starts to go on a big killing spree for his new best friend.
Aubrey Plaza is an amazing human being. She is so great in comedic roles and she is awesome here. She plays Andy's mom and she had him at a young age. You can see that she is vulnerable and that she is still learning to be a parent. She plays this this role so good and can't wait to see more of her in the future. Gabriel Bateman does a good job recreating the main character of Andy. He makes him likeable, but still realistic in his flaws. I could have sworn I seen him in things before and liked him, but I could put my finger on it. Upon looking up his IMDb profile, the kid is a little horror freak being in films like 'Lights Out', 'Annabelle' and the series 'Outcast'. The standout in this movie is Mark Hamill and whoever made the casting decision to make him the voice of Chucky. The doll wasn't as creepy as it was in the original, but it had element that were unsettling at the least. With Mark Hamill behind the voice you were freaked out from the first time you heard him speak.
I liked this movie and I'm surprised by that. Happy, but surprised. I really didn't think I was going to be able to get behind the fact that it's just a doll that's wiring has been messed up, but they explained it in a way that made sense. Granted it's not realistic, but I can understand where they're coming from in the movie. Like any slasher movie some of the characters make dumb decision and could have easily escaped the terror that Chucky bring on them. That was upsetting because I was enjoying the movie, but horror tropes like that are such a cliché.
Overall, I really believe you can have a good time in this movie. If you like slasher movies with comedic elements and dumb characters that get what's coming to them, give it a watch. I can say I recommend it.

155,manuelasaez,"An embarasment of an almost impressive calibre, but it sure was funny!",2,26 September 2019,"The original Child's Play stands as one of the few horror movies of my childhood that didn't need a remake. But if you had to remake it, why did you have to deviate so far from the source material? Instead of an occult practicing criminal possessing a doll, you make it so that a software engineer programs a modern doll to murder and kill? I mean, it just doesn't get worse than that. So many things went so spectacularly wrong in this movie, but the worst of it all was Chucky himself. He was hideous. A horribly designed mess of a doll that no one in their right mind would ever buy for their child, made worse by his horribly executed visual design that indicates that the people responsible for that mess had never watched the original nor have they ever taken an art class in their lives. It was so bad, that I wondered how it got through focus testing. No one brought up how offensively bad the dolls design was? How it wasn't scary, creepy or eerie but just plain bad? It was a bad fan art of chucky done by someone with very little talent.The movie was not scary and I spent the majority of it laughing. There were very few likeable characters, and most of the children were insufferable and annoying. There were a lot of bizarre decisions made in the script that not only lacked plausibility, but also made me question whether anyone involved in the movie even bothered to watch the original. What's the point of remaking a film if you are just going to throw away everything good about the original film?This movie was an embarrassment, for the writers, the directors, the cast, and the unfortunate team that was chosen to redesign and completely destroy Chucky. The only movie this serves to entertain are millennial who already have dubious taste to begin with. It's just a poorly made travesty that has no place in modern cinema.it was hilarious, though.

156,MinistryofDoom,Poor Reboot relying solely on Brand Recognition,3,22 September 2019,"Child's Play (2019) hardly shares anything in common with the original Child's Play (1988), other than the name of the film. Gone is the narrative of Charles Lee Ray, the dying serial killer who casts a black magic Haitian voodoo spell on a Good Guy doll, thereby trapping his soul in the body of the doll. Yep, you read that right. The whole premise of ""Chucky"" (aka: Charles Lee Ray), the evil doll and how he came to be, has been completely thrown out the window.Instead we are given is a story about a sentient web-connected all-encompassing do-anything robot companion that goes haywire and kills people. The 2019 Chucky is basically a Google Home device in the body of a doll. In fact, it's less a ""child's play"" thing (a toy) and moreso a smart device. It records video, it orders pizza, it can summon an Uber taxi, it can hack and control nearby devices, it can learn and store and repeat your most personal details. Oh and it walks, talks, carries conversations with the child that it is ""synced"" to, and is able to make decisions on it's own: such as who to kill, how to kill, and why to kill. It's Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. meets Terminator T-800, as an ugly looking doll.In the film, these dolls are so technologically advanced that the only thing preventing them from destroying human civilization is a line of code during the manufacturing process, and yet they're being sold to children in the toy isle of your local department store.Since there's no serial killer trapped in the body of this doll, Chucky's motive isn't to transfer his soul into the body of a child in order to live again. No, instead this learning/adapting robot toy goes on a killing spree because he wants to impress Andy and be his best friend. Yep, the toy has an unhealthy psychotic obsession with a child. This is where we are in 2019. I get that Paramount wanted to update the story of Chucky to make it more relatable to today's web-connected generation but I'm not quite sure that it works. The film takes Chucky to absurd mind-numbingly stupid sci-fi levels that teeter totter between horrifying and ridiculous for a good hour and a half.If this was indeed a franchise reboot, it's a weird one to greenlight. Don Mancini is still making Child's Play films. His most recent one was Cult of Chucky, in 2017, and it was actually good. This film gets it wrong on so many levels, that I can't even understand why no one raised an eyebrow and asked, ""Why are we making these decisions?""Sorry, but I think I'll stick with Don Mancini's version instead. It'll take more than a few gorey scenes to keep me interested in this mess.",Child's Play

But aside from that, this movie failed miserably for me.In the past month I've finally sat down and watched all the chucky movies after having seen the original Child's Play about a year ago. Without a doubt, the first movie stands well above this remake. But after having seen all the sequels, and yeah they aren't all perfect, it's clear to me how this movie missed the mark.Another movie that I rated as low as this was the Curse of Chucky because they managed to ruin chucky's look. This movie has the same issue. I'm fine with them making a new doll and name for it, but atleast design something that stays true to what made the first movie so good in the first place.Chucky needs to be this happy go-loving looking doll, this movie turns chucky into some weird straight jawed robot. Which made scenes in which he was supposed to look like a baby (when the mechanic was repairing him) look extremely odd. Also, the contrast between happy chucky and angry chucky in the original was engrossing, the anger in his face just screamed horror. But here it's so subtle. Red eyes aren't scary, I want that doll screaming, yelling, cursing and being expressive with his face.. This for me is a huge letdown.And then writing. Oh man, could they write a more dumb teenager? When your robot doll kills you cat I'm pretty sure you'd run and tell your mother and not just hide the damn body. The thing is, they made it seems like the son and mother had such a good and loving relationship, but he's too scared to tell her the doll went haywire? I could understand it better when the first kill would be a human that he'd be too freaked out but it just seemed extremely unrealistic. Also showing his week old friends a skinned face seemed very unrealistic and purely made to advance the story. It sucks though because the acting is genuinely good from Andy., the decisions just aren't. The friends he suddenly has are also a bit out of the blue, they didn't really show anything in common and it doesn't really work out well beyond that as they are way to oddly committed to the friendship, and then not anymore.The kills, well they are okay, the mechanic was a let down as the ''grand finale'' of his death was just blood splatters on the ceiling. The most memorable one would be the lawnmower thing that killed the annoying one dimensional scumbag boyfriend I guess.But all these kills that Chucky is commiting all feel so forced because it's trying to link back to certain things he learned from the kids/movies... but not really because he really goes out of his way to make it a bad time for his victims. So assuming it's just a hacked doll instead of the serial killer in previous movies is just a hard thing to believe. Also chucky not being made of flesh made his death so much more mundane. He's not yelling out in pain, nah, just gets shot by the cop, his head ripped off and then beaten by the kids with some blunt weapons. Just not exciting at all.The movie builds pretty slow as well, and that's fine, the first one is the same. But at around halfway I really found myself getting bored. And that's because of another reason besides these I mentioned;Comedy! Where? The things chucky yelled out in the first film where a mix of scary and hilarious. But it was fun! This movie is missing so much fun. They made the movie so damn serious but as a result it turns it into a boring movie.This movie is also filled with a bunch of callbacks to the original, some are okay but a remake always kinda misses the mark doing that.
So for me a 3/10 wouldn't watch this ever again.",Child's Play

159,nethy-nho,Ugly's play,7,16 November 2019,"Before I start to see that movie, i just knew that it won't be a supernatural thing, and the toy would just be a smart technologic toy, that off course have a problem, and gets crazy, and start kill every one, the franchise about Chuky are pretty worn, just offer us another story, was a perfect idea, and it works a lot, the new kid is very well as Andy, and now we have more details about him, and he have more friends, and have the opportunity to see Chuky's evolution is something interesting, have amazings deaths, but the problem is the toy, that are so ugly and kinda laughable, that i dont feel fear, some times i just laugh, but still is a great horror movie.",Child's Play
160,kuangzao,boring,5,28 April 2020,"Taking away the supernatural aspect is disrespectful to fans,Plus, it's stupid to through away a complete side-plot. That's way more interesting to bring the flesh and blood aspect of the doll",Child's Play
161,Breumaster,Chuckies Digital Renaissance,6,9 February 2020,"Some horror franchises are depleted. 'Child's Play' does a new attempt by a not so new story move - going digital. Chucky now has an A.I. So I was sure the movie is based on the unability of algorithms to fail when it comes to guess social human interactions. And that's what I got by watching this movie. That kind of story is told umpteen times in other scenarios. I have to admit that the makers created some scenes that are really creepy. But on the other hand, the developement of the story was predectable for people who have seen a few of these scenarios, including the escalations that such scenarios usually include. So it was a bit new, but not really. It has some pretty bad gore moments, but all in all it is a mediocre horror movie. I would recommend it for Chucky fans.",Child's Play
162,funnycommentor,Nice remake,8,26 August 2021,"In my opinion, the remake is better than the original. First of all, the kills are way better, it was creepier and the editing of the movie was better. The ending was predictable. The plot was just like the original. The jumpscares weren't scary at all.",Child's Play
163,AdrienneGrayceMusic,Finally a child's play movie worth watching,9,22 June 2019,"Nothing will ever outdo the first original childs play movie. Part 2 was ok and part 3 was decent, but once they started turning chucky into a comedy, i lost interest. It got crazy and all of a sudden chucky had a child. oh boy. I wasn't a fan of them changing what chucky looks like but the newly designed chucky is creepy in his own right. This movie was actually entertaining. I'm glad they incorporated modern time's technology and smart devices. that was a great edition. Mark hamill actually nailed the voice of chucky. Almost as creepy as the other chucky voice. To me, it was worth the hype. but again,nothing will compare to the original. So i can only give this a 9 because of that.",Child's Play
164,skullhead739,Terrible chucky film but decent horror flick,6,4 January 2020,"This film doesnt come anywhere near close to the greatness of the original chucky film. They should have renamed it, because it was a decent movie otherwise.Plot:
The plot is insanely dumb the 1st half, like I said they should have taken chucky out of the equation. Because no way in hell chucky was a creation of some depressed worker reprogramming a non scary looking doll.. I mean that doesnt even make any sense. Some scenes are typically cheesy but I enjoyed the movie and it had interesting death scenes and I really liked the idea of a robot doll with a sense of life and a wayward mind. The film made me feel for the characters and was gory/creepy in moments.Acting:
The performances weren't that great. The kids acting was the best out of everyone but had many cheesy and annoying moments where the characters are clueless and dismiss obvious signs. They also dont do anything you would expect a real person to do once finding out your doll kills things.Cinematography:
This film has a decent budget and therefore has good CGI, camera shots and special affects. There are many gory, and creepy shots. I just wish chucky looked more creepy.Conclusion:
Like I said in the title, this is a crap chucky film, but a good horror film. This is no where near a chucky film but I enjoyed it as a regular horror movie about a haywire robot. If you dont think about this film as a sequal and more as a normal movie I'm sure most will at least enjoy watching this.",Child's Play

166,edicionccq,Child's Play has been updated.,8,21 November 2019,"Child's Play is not about a classic toy that it shouldn't move anymore. It's a robot toy with artificial intelligence that shouldn't have that much free will.And it's indeed excellent.
I mean, the movie isn't perfect. It contains minor mistakes like plot conveniences, many of them.But they are entertaining so I didn't mind them.
The main feature of the movie in my opinion is the new concept of the franchise. The original saga was about a killer who transferred his soul to a toy, and he kills people because he needs transferring his soul again to a child. It was a decent concept for that time. At this time people want something new, especially something about AI and that's where this film shines.
I enjoy the new reason why Chucky kills and the way it develops to be incredibly cruel. Many creative choices were taken, and I love most of them. Give it an opportunity but keep in mind this isn't a remake, is a reboot.",Child's Play

168,brandonneicke,GREAT REMAKE,10,29 October 2019,"I grew up with child's play, still the 1st child's play is my favourite scary movie to date. Let's be honest tho, after child's play 3 they completely ruined chucky anyway, chucky has been ruined for decades by crappy acting low budget and joke worthy scripts. It's about time they killed chucky and remade child's play with a nice new spin, but a real budget real script and real acting. Very good movie and unless your going in complete biased you will thoroughly enjoy it. Anyone who thinks bride of chucky, cult of chucky or any of those lame chucky movies is better quality then this child's play remake obviously doesn't know cinema.",Child's Play
169,pokemon_trainer_lucas,Not as good as the original,5,21 June 2019,"I watched this tonight, and I was a little bit let down. I felt like whilst there was a few good jump scares and one particularly successful gory scene, the film overall felt more like a cheesy comedy than a horror, and that's not a good thing. It just wasn't convincing, and the acting of some of the teenagers was atrocious. If you've seen the original Child's Play, you'll probably agree with me that it's better than this remake.",Child's Play
170,hjalsayegh,A Black Mirror Episode.,7,27 June 2019,"The concept is original, it's doing it's own thing rather than copying the 80's film though there are a few nods to it for fans. Just nods mind you.Could have easily been an episode of Black Mirror and I think it might have done better as such, the material was a bit stretched out making the movie feel longer than it really is. There is some tonal deafness as you go from comedy to violence and extreme gore instantly... sometimes within the same scene.Overall it would have been a good made for TV movie, just not much else.",Child's Play

176,justinwfirestone,Thoroughly enjoyable,8,3 July 2019,"Chucky literally and figuratively gets a fully reimagined reboot, quondam Buddi, your best friend and IoT device who can integrate with your other Kaslan Corporation appliances such as your smart TV, smart thermostat, smart speaker, and even your smart car, providing a deeper augmented reality experience that is second only to real reality experiences such as talking to people in person, face-to-face, where concepts such as meaning lie between the cracks of otherwise fully interconnected animae.Buddi starts with an imprint sesh, so it is completely understandable that he would end up with some separation issues. He does not appear to ever need recharging, which may be the result of an arc reactor in the chest much like Iron Man's. As Chucky learns about the world around him, he inevitably concludes people are full of schadenfreude, prone to violence, and they don't want to miss a thing.The Chucky of 2019 has a flair for the dramatic, mixing equal parts Final Destination, Jigsaw, and Black Mirror. He prefers a chef's knife for most of his work, which is fortunate, because there always seems to be one lying around for the wielding, regardless of setting.Another fortunate feature is the critical role played by a watermelon, leading to one of the funnier sight-gags in recent memory. The ultimate lesson, however, is that people need people, and smart dolls can only fill so many voids in life.",Child's Play
177,el7,"It is it's own thing, and it works at that.",7,16 June 2020,"I'm a big fan of the original Child's Play, and I've kept up with that series, though I don't think all of the movies in the series are as good as the first movie. This version of Child's Play starts with a similar premise: a hardworking single mom manages through some shady shenanigans to get her hands on a toy to give to her lonely son for his birthday. The toy, a talking doll named Chucky, takes a possessive liking to the boy, Andy. Murderous mayhem ensues.Child's Play 2019 diverges from Child's Play 1988 in the manner in which Chucky becomes self-aware, and that divergence creates greater changes as the story-line progresses. In this version, Chucky was created when a sweatshop toy programmer has had enough of on-the-job abuse and removes all of the doll's inhibiting programming before killing himself. Since the doll is a learning AI instead of a mass murderer in a doll suit, that creates a situation whereby everyone Chucky comes into contact with becomes accidentally complicit in him learning to be evil. You just can't help but feel sorry for the doll in some scenes, and that's a vibe that some viewers are going to hate, but I liked it. It's just different from the original, that's all. The grand guignol finale in a department store is a touch that really suits this new treatment of the story as well. I still prefer the original film, but I also wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to this one.",Child's Play

The principal from The Breakfast Club is the CEO of the company that makes the 'Buddi' dolls. This is a poor attempt to update an 80's hit, where old-style dolls are outfitted with Wifi, and can control lights and TV's. The problem is that it shows people going to retail toy stores, which, as of 2019, are almost non-existent anymore! It has all the family and friendship cliches that are typical of modern movies. The violence often gets toned down, by changing camera angles so you can't see most of the violence. When you do see it, it is either too dark to make out, or happens too fast to get more than a brief blip of it. The children are like the ones in 'It': very annoying and acting unlike real kids would talk or act. The friendships seem forced at times, for the sake of moving the story along.",Child's Play

Chunky is voiced by Mark Hamill. Who is a master of character voices. This chicly is more. Creepy than the comical Brad Dourif chucks, there are some really gory scenes one in fact made me cover my eyes.

But for me, I could watch it on it's own terms and I enyojed what this movie had to give by making Chucky AI that actually does want to be Andy's friend but it is deeply broken on the inside. It's able to explore some very different things like friendship, jealousy and it takes things in a very different direction.

Apoun viewing the trailer I was really unsure, after watching the film in full I have a serious issue with this film because it is absolutely flawed.Not that the film has a little bit of entertainment and the acting is pretty solid, Mark Hamil's voice for Chucky actually gives a creepy tone to the doll which is perfect, There were moments in the first half of the film I found funny because the doll was doing some funny and weird things that were hilarious, As horror fans we are getting a few killed that was pretty twisted and inventive, But sadly the film as whole Lets down the hard work that been put into this film that I have to be brutally honest.If you never have seen the original Chucky films, this film might appeal to you, but the original fans of the original Chucky movie will hate this filmDislikes: Let me make this perfectly clear this wasn't Chucky, not by a long shot, not where near the concept of Chucky. which make me wonder if the director or writers ever watched the original childsplay movie.I understand they its a reboot and they need to do something Different But changing the concept from a spirit to an AI just 100% killed the film, not only from making a sequel, it just made chuck unrealistic with no personality.See the original film was given a personality because it wasn't just a Toy, it had an evil twisted human spirit control the body of the toy which gave chucky a personality and a reason to kill, Here with this film is just copying what other people were saying and it has no motive other than an AI to kill it just feels very lazy writing.Which is a shame because you have a legend Mark Hamil who has the voice for this film, you could've had him playing a twisted Serial killer in the film almost like the original, with a slight change, with Mark Hamil becoming the Doll, this would have been so much better for the film because his voice is perfect.Im sorry but that third act of the film was god awful, no shop would sell toys like that, that would have Sharp edges to do what they did, again what was the writer thinking here, very poor and weak storyline that completely kills Any sequel being doneOverall: Blend horror film that could've been done so much better, it like Hollywood has no imagination anymore.",Child's Play

187,tresm87,"An excellently vicious modernized reimagining with intriguingly updated story dynamics, relentless brutality, and some genuinely twisted charm.",8,26 June 2019,"8.6/10 I always thought the original Childs play was a solid horror film that had some really great moments and a fantastic performance by Brad Dourif. When they announced they were going to remake it, I along with everyone else wondered why? After seeing this new surprisingly smart and modernized take on the story I have to say I'm very glad they decided to do so, and that doesn't take away anything from the original.After a very intriguing new origin intro the film takes us to a familiar plot set up with Andy and his Mother getting a hold of the buddi doll. As things progress with this updated technologically focused story, things start getting intense and downright brutal. I really love the added smart tech aspects of the plot as it just makes Chucky's power even greater. Chucky and Andy also have an emotional connection that makes you care for both of them quite a bit as characters. Andy's character is also going through many hardships of growing up which also gives some relatability instead of having him be a helpless five-year-old. When the finale hits it's just so incredibly extravagant and violent and it's thoroughly intense.Mark Hamil's vocal work for the classic horror character is tremendously brilliant and gives the character so much personality and life. I also thought everyone in the film did great acting jobs all around and sold their roles. I was very skeptical with Chucky's look in the trailers and some press release photos but, I have to say they did a spectacular job on his practical effects with the animatronics. Also the CGI that was necessary for certain action scenes worked serviceably.Director Lars Klevburgh has a fantastically keen eye for certain lighting tones and colorization that adds a ton to the overall product. Camerawork is also nicely done and I love all of the throwbacks to the original films as well as some pop culture Easter eggs thrown in. The gore effects are undeniably some of the best I've seen recently and just got so ballistic and brutal yet so fun. I really do hope they can go somewhere in the future with this franchise because there is so much potential especially after this surprisingly excellent start. You can love the original and you can love the new one all the same and it's not a crime.",Child's Play

I expected some re-hash of the original with the same story line and all but NO. They changed everything except the names. I love it. Yes, there are some horror cliches but every good horror movie has them. I was so sidelined by how good this was.I will say that the two unbelievable things are: who would buy this thing? As a bear, black kid, blonde kid, etc IT IS CREEPY!!! The other is why was there a violence mode to be turned on or off? Seriously?I love the believability of this. Whereas the original worked on cheesy levels and voodoo, this movie works on tech (very cool and realistic) and everything makes sense. The doll was made to be violent and broken because of the disgruntled employee. The doll was taught murder through the horror film. Taught who to target because of who hurt Andy. How to kill through the sandwich scene. It's a learning bot, this all makes sense. Voodoo was always a fantasy.I'm upset about the cat and the black momma :( but I had a lot of laughs and left feeling like I could rewatch this.",Child's Play
193,varun-25071997,Gripping & Gory,8,20 June 2019,"One of the best horror movies ever made and my favourite film of the year so far. Having very low expectations for remakes and not watching the trailer gave me very little reasons to be hyped for this film but the end result is complete satisfaction.In an era where horror movies are released every other week and is now the favourite cake of the town we have seen many reboots, new experiments like Hereditary and also monster horrors like A Quite Place. Child's Play is uniquely great because it doesn't compromise in violence and is strictly made only for adults. Gabriel Bateman is the star of the film and has given an another great performance as a weird child after his role in Lights Out. Audrey Plaza doesn't have much screen time in this film and is mostly just a supporting cast.Lars Klevberg shows us a possible future of AI takeover and the dangers of too much sophisticated technology. The way children today spend more time in phones rather than playing in grounds or reading books is one of the biggest tragedies of our time, Klevberg subtly shows how it could lead to a collapse of a society. Poor labour rights, Abusive bosses, excessive technology and the flaws of capitalism are well highlighted in the movie and effectively are the reasons we get to the horror part.",Child's Play
194,BlueSkies765,A new Chucky,7,24 September 2019,What I liked most about this movie is that it never has the ambition of being more than a creepy ride. I've noticed more movies become 2+ hours long when the material doesn't always justify it.For new moviegoers this movie will be interesting as it's stylish and creepy. If you are a fan of the old movies the new Chucky shares similarities with the old story but also has the difference that Chucky isn't a seasoned killer this time. He thinks and reacts differently in situations. I liked how they visualized the new Chucky and I also liked the characters.,Child's Play
195,Dannyboi94,"A good thriller, but a mediocre remake",6,27 June 2019,"The original Child's Play is one of my favourite slasher movies, it was a great thriller with an iconic villain. The movies that came after it all declined in quality, but have all been entertaining. So I was pretty excited to here this movie was being released, with the great Mark Hamill as the voice of Chucky! What more could anyone want from a thriller/horror movie? However, while this is a good overall entertaining movie, it doesn't even compare to the original.This movie is well made, it has some truly gory death scenes, some of which will make you cringe, the characters are pretty good also, even more so the young boy who plays Andy - Gabriel Bateman. This kid was remarkable in the role, and you can tell he poured everything he had into his performance. His mother, played by Aubrey Plaza was also good, but I felt like she was underused. The mother from the 1988 version was much more compelling. Brian Tyree Henry and his in-movie mother, Carlease Burke had great chemistry, and I found myself wanting to see more of them. However most of the other characters are bland, like Andy's friends. The movie tried to make them similar to the 2017 IT, or Stranger Things, but failed miserably. They just didn't have enough screen time, or did little to add to the plot.The highlight of the film is Chucky himself, and by that, I mean the voice work by Mark, and the creepy personality of the doll. But that being said, I did not like the backstory to the iconic villain. He isn't a past serial killer, he is basically a rogue Cortana. That completely takes everything away from what made Chucky legendary. Knowing that a psycho serial killer was possessing it, gave him more flare. You knew he had a history, and his interactions with other characters he met, was entertaining. But this version of Chucky is basically a stalker, insane ex-girlfriend. Who will do anything to get you back. Sure, it works for this version of the character, but it doesn't make it memorable. Despite the brilliant Mark Hamill channeling his inner Joker.Child's Play is good, it is better than the past Chucky movies, and the best one since Bride of Chucky, even though this movie isn't connected to them all. But it just isn't as good as it could have been. If it had been a little longer, fleshed out the side characters a little more, it would have been brilliant. But people wanting some hardcore, bloody kills, that are brutal to watch, then they will love this.6/10",Child's Play
196,tmpsvita,Nope,4,20 June 2019,"The reason why the original Child's play is a good slasher horror or at least an entertaining one it's Chucky itself, he's fun, extremely charismatic and damn evil while the new Chucky version is just boring, he has no charisma at all, he's predictable and ugly (so damn ugly!).
And so is the movie, boring from the start to the end. It doesn't add much to the saga or change it enough but neither to the horror genre, especially in the slasher one. It use an obsolete formula that does not work and if paragonate to some of the recent good horror movie this just can't compete.
The characters are all flat, the story is not entertaining or engaging, the jump scares are really basic and so predictable and the direction has no personality.",Child's Play

198,alexpeychev,An enjoyable slasher,7,29 September 2019,The movie was a really wild ride. It was really scary even though the main villain is a doll. It was bloody and one of the best reboots. Really good jumpscares. The acting was perfect. I recommend you to watch the movie.,Child's Play
199,angiris,If it wasn't called Child's Play I would've rated it higher.,4,24 June 2019,"A mixed bag but in a way that leaves you thinking "" Great concept, wrong franchise""
The GoodMark Hamill's voice acting adds a lot to this film. The mixed Brad Dourif impersonating and slight joker laugh really hits home in terms of being bloody creepy.The beginning of the film is strong. Good build-up & establishment as to why Chucky is crazy, although I should say ""malfunctioning""The story is objectively good. I enjoy how it reminds me of an 80's robo-horror flick I can't remember at this time.But this is where the praise ends.The BadThe film had an identity problem. A huge one. And it feels like they wanted to make an ""AI is dangerous"" movie more than a Child's Play remake. And thats a real shame because there is room for both.But not in the same movie. It simply does not work. Sure, you can call it a reimagining but I dont buy it because we shouldn't go about altering established franchises that way.
It's tearing the Chucky doll's legacy through the mud of rather textbook horror as well. The kills aren't good. The camera cuts away a lot, the characters are at times just annoying or irrelevant or we dont really entirely get why they had to die, even. Yes, it's actually that confusing with the cops mother dying.The list goes on but I'd rather get to my final remarks because thats really all that matters in this review.ConclusionIts as if they wanted to remake Toy Soldiers but more R-rated... but couldn't get the rights and ended up with Child's Play instead, Literally all I was thinking as I watched this.
Dont get me wrong. Toy Soldiers is a masterpiece. part of my childhood, and this film apparently wanted to take the whole robo-military-AI outta control concept and go further witht it in a more typically creepy setting.
We even see Chucky assume control over nearby dolls and small drones. He's building his own army.
If this film was not called Child's Play... I would've genuinely rated it a 6 or a 7 for its cool ideas of how AI is learning from us, alike Microsofts Tay Bot. We all remember her and what the internet did to her in 1 day.Same with Chucky. The 2 great concepts here are as Tay, freedom to learn and accomodate culture and opinion. Whilst also being susceptible to human error, tampering, removal of X restriction and so on. The idea is really great and should be explored more. Because we do live in an age where AI is among us and the possibility for disaster are very very real. Prime example already mentioned.But it does not work... within a Child's Play movie. At all. Some people may argue so and welcome a re-imagining of it but I say its way too far. Child's play was dark, magical, borderline demonic and a horror founded in mysticism. Let alone the horror of imagining a serial killer inside your toy, watching you. That was the whole point and why Chucky to this day is TERRIFYING as a villain. Because you would never expect the doll sitting behind you right now would be watching you and planning on gutting you alive in your sleep. And it should've stayed that way. Because as terrifying as a bad AI can be, a human being with murderous tendencies, a malevolent, manipulative mind and inability to literally die... is worse.Final ThoughtsCould've been, should've been.
4 words to summarize this. It's a shame. They should've rebooted Toy Soldiers instead and used this concept, these types of villains. The whole robo-army thing. The film has really good concepts. If it wasn't a Child's Play film and didn't have the child's play scenery in it I would've rated it a ""arguably too high"" 6 out of 10. For the ideas and solid focus on AI learning from us.But as a Child's Play film it's a 4 in my book. Its below average. I prefer all the other films to it, and I wont be re-watching this one because I simply dont have any interest in watching a robot malfunction.
Mark Hamill is great. But he can't be charismatic when portraying a robot. And that is the ultimate and final flaw in this movie.Chucky... is lifeless. he's uncharismatic, he's uninteresting outside of tech aspects and ultimately you can kill him incredibly easily. You can even overpower him without issue unlike real Chucky who's straight up nuts and wild.""sigh"" 4 out of 10. Missed opportunity for something else. And an objectively bad portrayal of a Child's Play movie because it disregards and re-invents what should not be re-invented at all.The point of a remake is to make it better.
This film only hurts the franchise and ultimately the great concepts it explores within that should've been their very own thing.",Child's Play

It was far better than what I expected and you know why because I gave it a chance I knew this was going to be way different than the original because it was. I can't stand when people say it's not even close to the original well look at The Nightmare on Elm Street look at Halloween those movies failed because they tried so hard to be the original now they're telling that it's not similar to the original. What???? This film looked like it was a passion project more than just a cash grab. And because of that the movie already succeeded I love what they were doing with this movie they made him different they made him love Andy wanting him to be his new best friend in some scenes it made you feel for Chucky which is something that never happened to a horror icon and I can't believe it Mark Hamill did a magnificent job he really did and I am very proud of him overall this film was not as good as the original but it was way better than any of its sequels. 8/10.

Chucky was cute and creepy i think they nailed the desing.I liked the kid great actor, Aubrey Plaza played well... Aubrey Plaza... she is the same character in every movies or TV Show she does but it worked so i won't remove a point for that she did her job well.Didn't like that all the adult white men in the movie were stupid, fat creeps, wife cheaters or violent but eh it's hollywood these days.Very surprised good movie to watch on halloween coming up.",Child's Play
206,clock_me,lame and poor,6,15 September 2019,"First off i don't like how they decided to go for a computer killer doll instead of a serial killer using magic to take over the dolls body
also just like the orignal from 1988 we have a kid actor who is very bad for his acting and you can so tell that he is forcing really forcing his tears during the scared or sad scenesAlso when and this bothered me a lot how can a kid his age become so attached to a doll he only had for a few day that when ever he has to do anything to it like kill him or lock him up he gets teary eyed
another thing was the mother i have never seen a character so useless in a movie and her boyfriend is an ass and a very unlikable character who you never feel anything fro when it's his time to goanother thing was how god dam slow it was to get to the first kill it was almost 40 min and we never really get any character development it focuses to much on the kid and not enough on the people chucky is targeting
and the doll if we call him that look stupid compared to the original
when a story drags the viewer loses interest and by the time the big finaleI'm sorry but again why does the kid continue to get teary eyed eyed over the doll i mean he killed people and it's not like you really knew him that's so annoyingand for the last thing this is not scary in the slightest it's a mess I prefer bride of chucky it was way better then this tripe",Child's Play

Trying to bring in comedy to this movie just didn't land and was plain childish. And what's with this things with having pathetic kids become hero's. Never happens ever in life.Stop remaking or trying to reboot franchises unless you understand the original and what it was meant to be.Lastly, the doll looked stupid.

Now in The Year Of 2019 Here Comes a Reboot Of a ""Child's Play"" And in This One, The Story is Just Like The Original About a Single Mother Name Karen Barclay Who Buys Her Son Andy Barclay For His Birthday a Birthday Gift And That Happens To Be a Good Guy Doll Name ""Chucky"" But Little Does Karen And Her Son Andy Don't Realizes That The Good Guy Doll Chucky is Actually Possessed By a Serial Killer Named Charles Lee Ray. But in This New ""Child's Play"" is Totally a Completely New Different Kind Of Version instead Of By Having a Good Guy Doll The Name Brand is Called ""Buddi"" Doll That is a New Generation Of Dolls For Little Kids To Play With And Be That Child's Best Friend To The End But Buddi Doll That Andy Calls Him Chucky Suddenly Begins To Kill People That Treats And Bullys Andy Barclay But Later On Andy Descovers That His Buddi Doll Wants To Wreck Havoc And it's Up To Him And His New Best Friends To Stop The Buddi Doll Chucky From Attacking More People. Basically i Thought Cast Of This New Child's Play Film is That Aubrey Plaza Who Takes On a Role Of Karen Barclay Which i Thought Was Excellent And Actually in Real Life Aubrey Plaza Has Never Played a Mother Character Role Before So This is a New Kinda Of Role For Her To Play Also Gabriel Bateman Who Plays The New Andy Barclay Character Which Was Quite Good And Brian Tyree Henry Who Plays The Character Of Detective Mike Norris Was Okay But i Like The Character Better From The Original That Chris Sarandon Played And Then There's The New Voice Of Chucky is Mark Hamill Luke Skywalker From The Original Star Wars Film Franchises Did a Newer Take On Of Doing The Iconic Voice Doll That Legend Brad Dourif Did. Anyways i Thought This New ""Child's Play"" Version Was Brilliant And Exciting Even Thou The Original is Still a Classic But The Original Child's Play Didn't Have Have Any Blood Or Gore in it Even it's Called a Slasher Film But i Have To Say i Was impresse Of This New Child's Play Film That Took On a New Approach On The Story Had Like it Had Some Great Bloody And Gory Scenes in it That Delivers The Goods.",Child's Play
209,Benslie,Better than the original in some ways but worse in others,9,23 June 2019,"First of all, if you want to watch this film do not watch the trailer because it spoils major death scenes and shows a majority of the ending if this film. The acting in this film was surprisingly actually really good. Both Aubrey Plaza and Gabriel Bateman did great jobs as their characters. The biggest one that shocked me was Mark Hamill as Chucky. When it was first released that he was going to be voicing Chucky I was hesitant but now seeing the film he actually did a great job. Although, I do wish they did the same thing in the original movie where they had a different voice actor before Chucky turned evil. Same thing with the actual doll because it looked way too creepy for any kid to actually be interested in buying it. But honestly, when he does turn evil the look does work better than the original doll. The cinematography, done by Brendan Uegama, in this film was just outstanding. You could easily tell that the lighting in each shot was supposed to look that way and helped set the tone and mood for what was about to go down or just to make Chucky look creepier than he already does. One thing I didn't like though is what they did with Chucky's origin. Now, this is a SLIGHT SPOILER so if you don't want to be slightly spoiled than just skip over this part. Instead of just having a serial killer they just had an employee who got fired for daydreaming corrupted Chucky. It's so dumb and it should have just stayed with the original way. The music that was composed by Bear McCreary was amazing and like the cinematography helped with the scene. The ending makes no sense but hey at least it sets up for a sequel right. In the end, Child's Play (2019) is actually better than the original with some parts and worse with others. Definitely check this movie out.",Child's Play
210,tstudstrup,"Lame, predictable, not scary.",1,16 September 2019,"This is a decent, but bad attempt at rebooting Child's Play for the 21st century and the teenagers that were born around the year 2000.Let's start with the voice. Mark Hamill, who has proven himself a very good voice-actor before, if not a good actor, pretty much mimicks Brad Dourifs iconic Chucky voice here without nailing it.To make this remake relatable to 19-20 year olds of today, Chucky is no longer a doll possessed by a serial killer, he is a robot. A walking, talking version of Siri. Basically a smartphone inside a robot. This robo-doll can interact with every device in peoples homes, that are also ""Kaslan"" devices. Kaslan is the movies version of Apple. It can even order self driving Kaslan cars for its owners. A self driving Uber.Sounds lame? It is. So Chucky who is a robot-doll without its behavioral inhibitors inside it, becomes a self aware robot-doll, like Skynet in The Terminator franchise. It names it self Chucky and really does want Andy for its best friend.Every scare can be seen a mile away. Every kill as well. And yes it's R-rated and it has graphic bloody kills. But they are way over the top. Were talking kills like in The Saw franchise and The Final Destination franchise.This remake is riddled with inconsistencies. For instance the white trash mom of Andy: Karen is dating this loser Shane, and even when he violently shoves Andy, she doesn't dump his sorry loser ass. I know this could happen in real life. But any decent mom would throw out her boyfriend immediately if he was violent towards her kid.So Shane, who has a wife and kids, is the first one to be killed by Chucky, because he is mean to Andy. Al though he deserves it, it happens much too late in the movie. 38 minutes in. 38 minutes!! In the original the first death (Charles Lee Ray) happened within the first ten minutes. A factory workers suicide (which is an homage to the second death of Karens friend Maggie in the original movie) doesn't count. As for Shanes death (he is over the top nasty) his body is left without a face. Yet they can determine its him without even matching the bodys teeth with Shanes teeth. Really?It's a good idea on paper, to make Andy a teenager instead of a 6 year old boy. But it just doesn't work. Even though the acting in general is a thousand times better than the original, except for Aubrey Plaza as Karen, she is awful, Catherine Hicks was so much better as was Brad Dourif as Charles Lee Ray and Chucky, it just doesn't seem scary. Because Andy is not some kid manipulated by an evil serial killer inside a doll, to do the killers bidding. He is just a 13 year old kid with a smartphone robot -doll that has its wires crossed.Mike the police detective, who is now a fat moronic black guy (he was smart and a good cop in the original) is an unnecessary edition to the remake. He could have easily not been in the movie and it woldnt have made a difference.Even though this movie only cost a million dollars more to make than the original it seems much more expensive. Which is also a problem. The original was darker, grittier, meaner and scarier. Mainly because, we see Charles Lee Ray as a human, before he is almost killed and transfers his soul into a Goodguy doll. That Chucky was driven by revenge on the cop that killed him and his friend that abandonded him, moments before he was shot. The fact the he wanted to transfer his soul into Andys body, to become human again, also made him that much more scary.In the new version They made the robot a pratctical effect, like in the original where the doll was also really an animatronic in most scenes. But 1988 Chucky really seemed to be a living doll that changed its physical appearance as it became more and more human, looking more like Charles Lee Ray. 2019 Chucky, although a practical effects seem more like CGI than a real robot. And the whole idea of the robots eyes turning red, every time it goes psycho, gave away all the scare befores before they even happened.The ending is so stupid that it cannot be described. Lets just say it happens in the store Chucky comes from and it involves Chucky being able to control all electric devices including other robots and lots of people trying to get out of the store alive.The only believable thing here is the technology, that partly exists already. But instead of being a movie about a scary killer doll, this movie tries to scare us with our fear of humanoid robots and artificial intelligence, becoming self-aware. And that doesn't work.The original is certainly flawed, mostly by bad bad acting, from some of the cast, but as a horror movie it works.The remake doesnt work as a horrormovie. And because of that it just doesn't work at all.I recommend the teeanagers of today to watch the original instead. It might seem dated, but its actually scary. That goes for all the originals that all the awful remakes these years have been based on. Watch the originals. Not the remakes. The remakes are made to cash in on the popularity of the originals. Orginals made in the 80's and 90's when Hollywood still made good R-rated movies. Which means the originals are always superior movies.",Child's Play

212,Kirollos-Noah,Surprisingly good!,7,18 October 2019,"Child's Play is the latest horror movie remake, and it's directed by Lars Klevberg and screenplay by Tyler Burton Smith. And starring Aubrey Plaza, Mark Hamill, Gabriel Bateman and Brian Tyree Henry.Child's Play is a re-imagination of the 1988 horror classic, and it's about a mother gives her 13-year-old son a toy doll for his birthday, unaware of its more sinister nature.The original Child's Play was a very silly movie, but still a fun horror movie, for me, I like watching it, but its silliness is a little bit too much, so when I heard about the remake, and that Chucky is gonna be a robot, I thought that it's gonna a fresh start, and it's a little bit easier to turn Chucky into an evil doll, because he's a robot, and we all know about the prediction of the robot apocalyptic future. But this movie is not about this, this movie is not about the artificial intelligence, I don't wanna get into spoilers, because the trailers didn't show anything about how he turned into that evil doll.. anyways, I didn't like that much the way the first 5 minutes of the movie, but then it became so clear how he turned into evil, and I liked that way, but early on, it wasn't that good. Something happened in the first 5 minutes in the movie, somebody killed someone, and it was misplaced, it happened so quickly, and it was never mentioned againThe performances are great, Gabriel Bateman is really good, he did great as a kid who lost his dad in a very young age, but sadly the movie didn't show us any of that, except for once. Also the relationship with his mom, played by Aubrey Plaza is so amazing, by the way Aubrey Plaza is great in this movie, once more, and it's good to see her in a horror movie, instead of the comedies that she participated in the last few years! Mark Hamill as Chucky is MVP, just like what everyone was expecting, he was terrific as Chucky! Brian Tyree Henry as Detective Mike Norris is good, he is really funny, I enjoyed his part in this movie. There are some other kids in the movie I didn't like, they were just there, like in most movies, the typical group of kids.There are lots of things to love about this movie, it doesn't take itself to serious - not like some of the previous Chucky movies did- it even has some sequences which are only for fun, and I liked that, the movie is creepy and funny.The design of Chucky that everyone was completely trashing on was actually one of my favorite things in this movie, he's adorably terrifying, I loved it! While the original was meant to me scary, this one understands that it's actually a doll for kids, but a little bit upgraded to control all of your products by the same company, I thought that the design is actually better than the original, it's just my opinion.Actually I think this one is better than the original, yeah, it lacks some of the narrative, it cared too much about Chucky more than the human characters, even though, the human characters could have added way more to this movie, if it was a little bit longer enough to show us more about this family, I could have cared more and more. But still it's a really fun, horror and entertaining movie, the score was really cool, great acting from everyone, and Mark Hamill delivers as Chucky.I'm gonna give Child's Play a B!Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review! And as always thank you for reading my review.",Child's Play

214,robinsonaustin-07490,When Killer Machines Attack,8,26 June 2019,"O Child's Play. For a reboot of a beloved series, I have to say, I loved it. I am by no means a Chucky fan, but I kind of like the different route they went with the killer doll. For one, the relationship between Andy and Chucky here is actually genuine instead of manipulation. That just makes the moments where Chucky's malfunctioning comes into play surprisingly sad. You actually have moments where you feel bad for Chucky because here, he was the way he was because a disgruntled worker removed the safety features from him in an act of spite towards his boss.There are scenes that were suspenseful and the kills were pretty imaginative my favorite one being when Chucky makes mince meat out of Karen's boyfriend (who had a family already mind you) with a lawnmower, and then wraps his head around a watermelon and gives it to Andy as a present. The worst of the gore is censored, but the kills were regardless memorable. As was the final act. Mark Hamill does a good job as Chucky and goes an entirely different route here that differentiates him from Brad Dourif's Chucky. In the 2019 film, Chucky starts off as initially curious and is later driven to protect his owner through violent means. It really also serves as a small commentary on how much control technology has over our lives.The actor who played Andy Barclay does a good job at playing the conflicted owner of the Buddi doll who slowly realizes that his doll was developing murderous tendencies. The actress that played Karen...was fine, but the relationship felt more of a big sister/little brother one. Yes, the film explains why this may seem to be the case, but I admit it's a minor nitpick. As for anything else...it's a film about a killer AI doll going on a killer spree. That's it. It's nothing Oscar-worthy, but you shouldn't go in expecting something grand. It's a call back to all of the classic slasher movies of the 80s and the soundtrack was also the best part of the film IMO. Really love how they reimagined the ending theme to the 1988 film.",Child's Play

217,makleen2,A murderous doll with the ability to control smart devices runs amok in this fresh reboot.,5,29 June 2019,"Written by Tyler Burton Smith and directed by Lars Klevberg, Child's Play (2019) is a remake of the 1988 horror film of the same name. In this version, Chucky is a sabotaged smart-toy who learns violence is cool by watching human behavior. As such, the supernatural elements of the original have been removed. What remains is a contemporary morality play about the dangers of smart technology and our addiction to electronic devices.Karen Barclay (Aubrey Plaza) is a single mother living in a distressed urban neighborhood with her son, Andy (Gabriel Bateman). Andy's loneliness leads Karen to give him a Buddi doll (voiced by Mark Hamill) for his birthday. Though visibly dysfunctional, the doll (which calls itself Chucky because it has to, I guess?) imprints on Andy and quickly becomes overprotective.Andy soon meets two other kids in the apartment building, Falyn (Beatrice Kitsos) and Pugg (Ty Consiglio), and the trio play pranks on Karen's jerkish boyfriend, Shane (David Lewis). Detective Mike Norris (Brian Tyree Henry) suspects something is amiss. Can Shane and friends rein in Chucky's violent tendencies before it's too late?Child's Play is the latest horror-franchise reboot, and it was only a matter of time. In the horror pantheon, I would put Child's Play on a second or third tier behind obvious powerhouses like Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Friday the 13th. Its premise of a killer doll is just a little too campy, and the original films do play up the humorous element. Still, Child's Play has a reliable fan base.If you love the Child's Play franchise, you'll probably love this film. It changes some main elements but keeps enough of the original to satisfy fans. I'm not into the slasher subgenre, but I'd say Child's Play (2019) was a competent big-budget horror film. It just doesn't rise to the level of It (2017).Casting was partly to blame. I'm an Aubrey Plaza fan, but she seemed out of place here. Whether this was a problem with the script, or Plaza being unfamiliar with playing the generic mom role, I can't say. The casting choice definitely left her comedic strengths rotting on the vine. She would make a much more convincing older sister, camp councilor, or babysitter in a different horror film.Of the three main child actors, Beatrice Kitsos stands out. She performed admirably in her first feature film, giving Falyn a smart, scrappy personality lacking from the other children. Gabriel Bateman's performance as Andy was adequate but a little too milquetoast. His character arc from kid too intimidated to make friends to hedge-saw wielding hero isn't quite believable.Child's Play (2019) was writer Tyler Burton Smith's first full-length screenplay, and it shows. A perfect example where the script fell short was the scene in which a character is attacked while hanging Christmas lights. It appears to be late summer or early fall (hence ripe watermelons). Why on earth is he hanging Christmas lights? Is there no other reason he'd be on a ladder? It's like Smith just thought that would look cool and wasn't thinking about the obvious incongruity.This didn't seem to bother audiences, who have reacted mostly favorably. Child's Play (2019) has already grossed around $20 million on a $10 budget, virtually guaranteeing a sequel. I was never a fan of the original film or the franchise, so maybe I missed something, but I did think it was a fun, entertaining horror film with a freshly contemporary message.",Child's Play
218,Exiled_Universe,An amazing horror movie that was way better than expected!,10,23 September 2019,"Honestly this movie was great and i gave this a 10 because i dont have any complaints about this movie. It was way better than the old chucky movies because this movie actually makes sense and the old movie had a curse and all that fake witchcraft crap but this is actually possible because in this movie it was programmed into the doll so thats actually possible to happen in real life and thats actually kinda scary. The pacing was good and it was good that it was like that so i can follow along easily. Now many people hate this movie for the lack of kills which was like 3 or 4 but to me it wasn't about that, i mean i love kills but this one gets a pass because i loved it and it was a great change and a step up and i honestly think that it was a great change and a big step up from other horror movies. Some people hate the new look of chucky and he barely talks but i thought he was cool and didn't mind at all. You can tell that this movie is from the producers from it because you can get those vibes. Anyway my parents loved it and so did i and i haven't even seen all the chucky movies actually. Anyway go see this its amazing and even though there was a lack of kills the gore was great and i loved that and that made up for it, modern horror movies now have a lot of gore now which is great, so watch it.",Child's Play

I'll admit the doll is cowardly creepy but as usual, just like the last Chucky this was pretty disappointing. There was only 1 kill that I thought was pretty cool. I'm sure the way this played out when the child got the toy this wouldn't have happened especially when the 1st kill came to play.

224,azeemnavarro,Who asked for this?,2,3 November 2019,"If you expect this to be anything more than another failed attempt to remake a classic horror franchise... then you must be kinda dumb, sorry.
This tried to be an updated version of the original, taking out the paranormal aspects and making Chucky just a malfuntion product. This makes the movie worse because:
a) Chucky is not a character anymore. The original one was a charismatic killer that gave us a bunch of good laughs... the new one is just an ugly robot. Not even Mark Hamill's voice acting gave this doll a soul.
b) The wrong doing's of the doll doesn't make any sense. In the original it was comunicated that the doll was super strong because a real man was ""inside"" it; but in this remake he's just a doll that can control technology devices, no real threat there.
c) With no supernatural stuff here, this just seems like a bad 'parody' of Black Mirror.
Everything else is bad, bad and bad.
Everyone's acting here sucks. Aubrey Plaza is so miscasted that ends up being funny, maybe that's what she was going for. The child's are merely stereotypes, not even our main character is interesting.
The movie tried to be more like a comedy; just like the original, but it just doesn't work, is not funny. What's actually funny is the aspect of Chucky; he's just extremely ugly, not scary at all, so I can't take the doll suriously (like I was supposed to?).
Give this thing a 2 'cause is at least entertaining at some moments, some aspects are quite nice but not fully exploted (like Chucky learning violence because of watching movies), and Mark Hamill does a decent job. But yeah, skip it and just watch the original.",Child's Play
225,HorrorFanatic4Life,Such a sad remake,4,5 October 2019,"This movie lacked so much I don't even know where to begin. I will start saying that it is so hard to appreciate a ""remake"" of sorts such as this when the originals were so brilliant. This movie is almost an embarrassment to the rest. The ""Chucky"" was nothing worth going crazy over. Everything else about the Chucky movies was the same in terms of character names, etc, but that doll was nothing like the original. Not even close. What didn't make sense was the fact that the dolls themselves were futuristic but nothing else about the movie was.There were the typical gory scenes, but nothing about any of it was scary or even creepy for that matter. It at least could have been that, but it wasn't.I was such a big fan of the originals which could have been the reason for my high expectations, but this movie sadly did not deliver like I had hoped.However, I am giving it a 4 because of the few, what I thought to be, hilarious scenes. And the kid who played Andy played it well. His acting was all spot on, as were a few other characters. But that does not help the movie enough for a review any higher than that.",Child's Play

This year it's been Pet Sematary and now Andy in a child's play movie. Chucky almost takes over the role of the naive and younger cast member. His naive nature and willingness to please opens the door for some incredibly stylish and creepy kills and chills. Chucky replaying the death of the cat is truly freakin creepy.

It is definitely the worst in the series. Why does a doll have a violence inhibitor setting that can be turned off with a click of a button? Why did the angry factory manager's words not sync up with his mouth? Why did lightning strike before dude fell out the window? I mean... wtf did the angry factory manager say to the dude that made him want to either kill himself or program Chuckie to do it? And overall.... why does Chuckie look like a doll from 1980, yet he controls all the smart tech equipment in a world that has to be set a decade in the future to at least slightly justify an at-home robot controlling everything? Why tf did that lady put Chuckie in her baby's crib??? All this was within the first 3 minutes. This is HORRIBLE.",Child's Play
230,realityinmind,Why this movie's A.I. is 150% incorrect...,1,28 September 2019,"This movie is egregious. Yeah they put in a bunch of symbolic nods to the originals for the fans, but they totally wiped out the franchise in the process!! WHO is this movie supposed to appeal to? Original fans will be pissed off that the movie has nothing to do with the franchise. Adults will find it atrociously unbelievable with a bunch of overused horror cliches. Teenagers will think the doll is stupid af and would rather watch Annabelle. And preteens won't be allowed to watch it because it has way too much bad behavior by kids. WHY was this movie even made? To absolutely ruin the franchise?! This shouldn't have even been a Child's Play movie. They took some teenage horror script about an A. I doll killing people, and skinned it with Child's Play to make it sell better.There are TWO main issues that make this movie absolute nonsense.1) Why would a ""violence"" setting even exist on the doll?The concept of ""violence"" is so ambiguous... the doll would have had to be programmed with morality, and then have the morality partitioned into a folder labeled VIOLENCE, so that the code could then be switched off. But it would ALWAYS be an automatic setting that is turned off for EVERY SINGLE DOLL!! So, when would someone EVER need to switch that setting on? There is no point in the setting existing in the first place, let alone a programmable switch that can be turned back on by any programmer with a screwdriver.2) If it requires a programmer with a screwdriver to change the violence setting on the doll from off to on, before the doll is fully constructed, then how tf was Chucky able to force a doll on the shelf to commit violence? How can Chucky change the setting on another doll??The only answer is this: ""Any doll that has their violence setting turned on will also have the ability to turn on the setting for any other doll"".Okay... so how did Chucky maintain control over the other dolls once Chucky turned on their violence setting?Chucky's control over the dolls should have immediately been severed internally once the doll had the violence setting turned on, otherwise Chucky could have turned the setting back off. Which means that Chucky could have turned his own setting off. Which means that Chucky could have turned his own setting on. Which means that any doll can turn their violence setting on or off at will. Which means that any doll can turn the violence setting of any other doll on or off. Which means that another doll could have stopped Chucky by simply being instructed to turn the violence setting off for Chucky. Which means that the whole opening scene of the movie where the programmer turns on Chucky's violence setting was completely pointless... Chucky could have done it by himself whenever he wanted!DO YOU SEE HOW RIDICULOUS THIS MOVIE IS?!?!The fact that a doll can make every other doll commit violence means that the entire movie's plot and all the violence is solely due to the existence of a violence setting in the doll in the first place. This means that Kaslan Industries is solely responsible for everything that happened because they programmed the doll to have a violence setting and they programmed the doll to have permission to turn on the violence setting of any other doll. But at the end of the movie there is a commercial by Kaslan Industries that highlights that they are not responsible for any of the violence, so they will just continue making their dolls after a voluntary recall. LAUGH OUT LOUD.I have read reviews where people said that this movie showcases the horrors of A. I. But that is absolute and udder nonsense. This movie is filled with so many inconsistent holes and ridiculous nonsense, it does not showcase anything but the intelligence factor of the scriptwriters and filmmaker being equal to ZERO.This is worse than the Godzilla remake with Matthew Broderick from the 90's. The director of this movie #LarsKlevberg needs to be involuntarily recalled from making any more movies. He ruined the Child's Play franchise on a level that it might possibly never recover from. This very well may be the worst horror reboot of any horror movie/franchise in existence. Hellraiser, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Saw... none of those reboots could ever be as bad as this.Don't let high-quality digital film, updated lighting, enhanced audio, special FX and CGI fool you into thinking that this movie is actually ""okay""... this movie is atrocious and should not even exist.

He was a doll who was reprogrammed with no safe guards, and slightly glitched. Who learns from the kid different things, that unintentionaly teaches the doll ways to kill. And he wants to make the kid happy. And anything that makes the kid upset is bad. And bad must die.
It was very well done, Aubrey does an...interesting job playing the role of young mom. It's different for her, hit and miss at certain points.Only thing I didn't like, way to gory.

234,mjfhhh,A THINKING HORROR MOVIE?,6,20 June 2019,"Everybody knows the story. A single mom gives her son a present that didn't turn out to be exactly what it seemed. His name is Chucky and he is your friend to the end. Only in this version the boy doesn't want the doll, he wants his mom and the mom only gives it to her son to compensate for something else.Here comes a remake of a horror classic that takes a definite new turn. Preceded by a cheeky social media campaign the film looked a wicked new version of everyone's favorite murderous doll. I promised myself to keep my expectations in check but I didn't. All I wanted form CHILD's PLAY remake to be something that will take my mind off the original and let me enjoy it on its own merit. I did manage to switch off... at least for a while.One thing you have to give to the new version - it is quite a different take on the story we know. Sacrificing the woodoo angle, this Chucky is AI gone rogue. With its limits to harm humans hacked and removed he is still a creature of innocence when he enters the home of a young boy called Andy. Andy is definitely too old for toys for sure, he only accepts it to please his mom, but when the doll called Chucky turned out to be smarter than he ever imagined he treats it like a new iPhone and is immediately absorbed by the experience. But not quite knowing what he is dealing with he leads his little pet to the road of destruction.The best thing about the new CHILD'S PLAY is that its antagonist is not as one dimensional evil as we expect him to be. It is Andy's daily life and struggles that make him evil and nothing else. When in the movie's climax Andy screams ""It's my fault!"" we agree with him. Chucky's degradation from the best friend to the thing of evil is hard to watch, and it made me feel something horror movies usually fail to do - a pity for the monster.What if Google Home, Siri or Alexa gone homicidal just by reading your browsing history and took for granted every mean thing you said? And then acted on it on its own accord? If this premise is not scary what is? But being an AI makes this Chucky less complete, gives him less personality and despite the fantastic effort of Mark Hamill (his voice) he still remains a cold robot.The film is definitely plays with the idea of electronics taking over kids' lives and it's only when Chucky gets berserk that Andy finally gets new friends to socialize with. The film is undoubtfully inspired by STRANGER THINGS. A chubby boy, a black kid, a nerd and a kick arse girl team up to fight evil? Yes this rings a bell.The few murders are gory and inventive, but it is mostly middle aged unattractive men who get the cut. One thing that CHILD'S PLAY would be criticized most for is Chucky's design. No one in the modern world would buy a doll that ugly. It would be much better to introduce a cute Pokemon... but this is another movie entirely.
I promised not to compare the film with the original, but then I just cant help it. The original was epic. There was more epicness in its first five minutes when the toyshop exploded than in the whole of the remake...
But the new movie made me think and want to talk about it. And this is a good thing. If you are horror fan you cannot miss this one. And the soundtrack by Bear McCreary is to die for!",Child's Play
235,umunir-36959,The kids might like this,2,21 September 2019,"Before going into the details, I'm gonna start with the concept of the film and it's totally lame. Are we really showing a ""doll"" killing grown up people? What century is this? I know there are various movies made in the past on this chukky thing but this is the first one that I watched. This was more of a fantasy film than horror.There are a hell lot of things in this movie that don't make any sense. First of all the doll is a robot. And robots are electronic products which means they require some power source. And this robot was supposed to work on a battery as I saw written on the box of the toy ""Battery included"". But no battery runs forever without recharging. I never saw them charging the thing. Even it stays active at night.Okay lets say that the battery is so massive that it only needs to be charged for once in a month or a week maybe. But the company should've kept a button known as On/Off on the doll atleast so the users could turn it off when they want to. Or maybe there was a button but the dumb kids didn't knew about it. They even kept it running while it was locked in the closet and at night.Secondly, how can a ""doll"" be so powerfull that it is cutting grown up people into pieces like Chainsaw. How the heck can a doll who isn't longer than my arms can hang a women up there with a rope on her neck? Every single person the doll attacks tries to run away like it's a UFC fighter. Afterall it's just a toy. Go attack it!. It's intelligent but it's not stronger than you. Just avoid that knife from it's tiny hands and you're okay.The head of the dead man was so heavy that even the women wasn't comfortable carrying it. But our super powerful doll not only beheads that man but brings it all the way back to home and wraps it in a gift sheet. Maybe it used a car and it also knows how to drive.Other than that, the atmosphere of the scenes was good. The acting was also okay. I won't criticize things that weren't bad.I still might be forgetting many things that I can't point out here. But overall, I'm gonna say this movie might be entertaining for your kids because they don't go too deep or try making a sense out of movies. But for adults, definitely a NO!",Child's Play

239,influxtwo,Techno-Thriller,8,22 June 2019,"As a fan of the old ones I did not let the behind the scenes controversy steer my opinion or bias. I was willing to enjoy this as a standalone film for what it is. A modern techno-thriller that takes place in an unspecified slight-future setting, not too far from our own. A satire on technological learning, dependance, and consumerism.At times it worked better as it's own film rather than a part of the Chucky legacy we all know. With that said it is a standalone companion film that doesn't try to throw the same punches as the original. Not with out flaws by any stretch and of course it is far-fetched and contrived, but has enough charm to keep you involved.Is it a complete replacement over the previous trademarked films? Oh of course not. You will respect or disrespect those just the same I like every single sequel for clarification, even Seed and the others that garner backlash- Yes I'm looking at you Don Mancini, you know you ignited a classic. This new one is far too different and it's own for me to even connect the two. But with the voodoo aspect gone, it plays more like a killer robot movie. Which for fans of sci-fi might be a welcome surprise and a fresh angle to the genre and tradition of these films. There is no magic here. But instead a cold future hinged on technology where if you're not careful it can be exploited, used for danger, or worse. The slight cyberpunk vibe was an interesting theme to meditate on. It leaves you questioning your dependence on technology and willingness or trust towards it. Then there is the consumerist nature of the film, all of these topics, more thought-provoking than expected with a story about a killer doll.Now to the doll. I liked the new robotic design, well I mean, I didn't HATE it. The face is a little rough in some scenes, but in others works very well. Glass soulless digital eyes, glitchy voice. The doll looks very different. Sometimes is works well, sometimes it feels a bit like foreign deja'vu. There was something missing of course. Some say quite literally, ""A soul"". and that is where the biggest difference lies. The doll is not playing the same character. There is no personality his own, no real, self-thinking wit. It is simply a learning, and killing machine. This is not the same doll capable of numerous unique sequels and spin-offs like the original, and nor is it the same doll to ignite a legacy of it's own. I liked it but it does not replace the originals. But it is an alternate plot to muse on things a bit differently.It was nice to see Aubrey Plaza in a ""serious horror movie"" role even though they didn't give her much material. The characters don't get a lot of character development as a whole. But they still had good performances and chemistry that kept things feeling more organic. The gore was also well done enough to avoid complaint.I enjoyed it for what it was. A techno-thriller, android on the loose, in a high-rise, in an unspecified future-type of movie. Reminded me a bit of films like 1990's ""Hardware"". Strong enough film to be it's own. But I feel it is a passing ride, rather than one to re-do it all. I feel the healthiest way to view a remake is just that way. It's not there to cover the past. It's there to build on it. and this does.",Child's Play

241,Ingrouille181,A better movie then I was expecting,6,25 June 2019,"At first I had no interest in seeing this thing; I remember back to 2010 when I was looking at ""remake"" posters for a supposed Child's Play remake coming out in 2012. it had a pretty impressive fan made poster, and a sleek new Chucky design. But that movie turned out to NOT be coming out. Later on, in 2013, we had a new Chucky movie come out, but it was Curse of Chucky, not a remake. We've since had Cult of Chucky and that's where it should stay, in the same universe; there's no need to made a Chucky remake, especially if it's just gonna be the same story, with the same gimmick of a serial killer possessing a doll and voodoo. But nowadays, with all the new technology and possibilities we have, there's now a reason to make a Child's Play remake. Away with the dark magic and voodoo rituals, and now in with the Artificial Intelligence going haywire. Perfect, simple and most of all effective.The story follows single mother Karen Barclay and her son Andy, who one day get a Buddi doll, built in with a state of the art A.I system. After a while, the buddi doll, which Andy calls Chucky, begins to take his wishes too far, leading to a series of horrific events.Audrey Plaza is good as Karen in the movie, and it's strangely a perfect roll for her. All the kid actors are good, can't say any were bad, they do their job which is mainly to be scared. Mark Hamill is definitely a good choice for Chucky, having voiced the Joker for decades now. And I can't say he's distracting, he adds a more whimsical, innocent tone to his voice which makes it distinct from his joker voice, and makes him come off as a completely different personality to the Brad Dourif Chucky. He's unpredictable, and I like that it's partially Andy's fault in this; being a modern day kid, this Andy is way less innocent than the 1988 Andy. There are some gruesome deaths in this one, and adding Mark Hamill's Chucky voice to these scenes makes it even more creepy.But sadly, Brad Dourif is still the one and only Chucky. The reason Chucky is an iconic killer doll is because the original Child's play movie and the series are gimmick movies; are we able to accept an A.I. controlled Chucky doll in this, yeah definitely, but just the fact that it's a seemingly innocent doll possessed by a deranged egotistical serial killer is what makes Chucky iconic to begin with, so the story being updated to him just being an evil A.I doll takes the charm away from it, which is why this remake is completely unneeded and took 3 decades to make.Does this remake have rewatch value to it; yes it does. It's an interesting update, and adds something to it, unlike completely unneeded remakes like the Poltergeist remake. This movie even leaves it open for a sequel, and I'm interested to see where they go with this, if they even make a sequel. You get the same feeling you get after seeing Cult of Chucky, where the stakes have been drastically altered. If you need something to sit down with and kill a few hours of your time with, this is pretty entertaining.",Child's Play

NOT TO MENTION, and I loved every Chucky movie from Child's Play 1-3 to the ""Of Chucky"" films, with an exception of Cult, that Mancini had already brought back Chucky into strictly horror. It's highly disrespectful and really ridiculous. As it's own film, fine, it's okay. But this is Chucky. He looks horrendous, he sounds ridiculous, his back story isn't sinister anymore. It's a killing machine. Literally a machine. This isn't a possession film. It's hardly a horror film. Chucky is Chucky he can't be changed and kept with the same name and similar attire, it's senseless and stupid. I despised this film all the way through. Brad Dourif IS Chucky.

253,Kristamw,Excessively Gory,3,24 June 2019,"SPOILERS ABOUND
After not watching the original Child's Play for thirty years and then recently finding a new appreciation for it, I was interested in giving this reboot a try. I wish I hadn't.
The movie takes the idea of a murderous doll in a whole new direction. This ""Chucky"" is not possessed by a serial killer, but has been deprogrammed by a disgruntled employee. This means that the doll has no inhibitions. So when Andy's mom essentially steals the doll, Andy believes he has found a reliable 'friend'. Wanting to name him Han Solo (an insulting humorous wink to Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker, as Hamill voices Chucky), he insists that he hears himself named ""Chucky"".
The first part of the film focuses on Andy and Chucky becoming friends, with Andy continuing to ask, ""Are we having fun now?"" it is clear that the doll is childlike, learning about the world and trying to understand it. Unfortunately, he responds in gruesome ways. For instance, when Andy complains about his vicious cat, he soon finds Chucky trying to choke the cat. It seems that Chucky gets the message fast, but then he watches Andy and his friends laughing as they watch a sick scene from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.
(Let me pause here: I refuse to watch these films because of their basis on a real-life disturbing situation; there is no entertainment value to these, only a sick descent into evil that should never be shown, much less glorified).
At this point, I was feeling queasy and upset because I never wanted to be exposed to that franchise.
So then, Chucky sees them enjoying the film and decides to stab Andy, adding that he thought he would find it funny. Clearly, the writers are sending this idea of a nature vs. nurture message, where we mimic what we see and must be guided. Once again, Andy makes it very clear that such actions are in no way okay. Again, it appears that Chucky understands.
But then the movie quickly accelerates into a sick bloody mess. Chucky is no longer naive, he is brutal with murderous intentions to kill everyone associated with Andy because nobody should be his friend, but him. Now he has no excuse for the brutality he sheds as he is very well aware of right from wrong and has decided (pun intended) to join the dark side.Writing Quality: Lame. There is no plot here and poor Andy has practically no role models. We don't have a clue where his father went and his mom is too busy enjoying her boyfriend to see how bad he is to Andy. He is deaf in one ear, but we don't get any explanation for it. Also, they don't use his deafness, which would have been perfect in a film like this; a scary scene where he has trouble hearing Chucky, where the audience is also deaf--now that would have been cool. Instead, the writers, outside of the moral message and destroying Chucky at the end, dive into a disturbing overly graphic bloody kill spree. We see almost every kill in great detail and realism.
Scare Factor: The scene in the car with the cop's mom is nicely staged with lots of tension. it's unclear when Chucky will pop up, though we hear him chanting. Hamill does do a good job sounding spooky as he sing-songs his way through the action.
Content (sex, language, & violence): No sex, but one scene where Andy walks in on his mom heavily making out with her boyfriend. Another scene shows the maintenance guy looking lasciviously as he watched Andy's mom take off her bra (we only see her back). Tons of language, mostly by Andy and other teens, presumably because they live in the ghetto and have picked up on bad habits. Horrifying violence numerous times throughout the movie. A maintenance man is hanging onto a pipe that Chucky keeps increasing its heat; the man is also dangling over a whirring table saw. The man's hands become so hot that he loses his grip and is chopped into pieces on the saw. Andy's mom's boyfriend is on a ladder as he manages a strand of Christmas lights when Chucky shakes the ladder, causing him to fall where we see a closeup of his ankles break and then his face is fed into a roto tiller with tons of blood spewing. These, along with the Texas Chainsaw scenes, are the most gruesome and sick kills.
Values: A son protecting his mom and friends and taking responsibility for not stopping Chucky after he first choked the cat (he later kills the cat) and then his mom's boyfriend. He becomes a willing martyr to keep everyone safe. A cop also uses himself as a human shield. The idea that we mimic what we see is evident, but so is the reminder that we all make choices and can choose to do good, as everyone does, instead of bad, like Chucky.
Gabe Bateman (Andy) performs his role well. When he crys, be it in shock, agony, or remorse, we empathize. The cop and his mom are endearing characters as well and they add a bit of reprieve from the gore. Hamill's voice is unnerving, which works here. But overall, a disturbing movie whose entertainment value and endearing qualities diminishes due to the unnecessarily realistic and excessively bloody violence that ensues.",Child's Play

257,dayton-w-price,"Great concept, just unoriginal.",6,3 September 2020,"I found the idea of a super intelligent AI that is ever learning and prone to violence, too familiar to films like, I Robot, Eagle Eye and Terminator franchise, et cetera. I think the people involved had a cool idea, and wanted to bring Chucky into the present, for a newer audience is fine and great, but not needed or necessary. Chucky just isn't scary or creepy enough, it lacks the charm of what made the original so scary, the idea of a serial killer soul trapped in the body of a doll via voodoo magic, was creepy as hell, and had never been done before, that's why the franchise was so successful, because it was new and original, I'm just un afraid of a AI learning Robot, that has no limitations. Ok the positives, i enjoyed some of the kills and, and found some of the dialogue between the kids enjoyable enough, but the main reason why I decided to give it a watch, is because of the legendary Mark Hamill, who I'm massive fan of, is the best part of the movie, although I'm still more partial to Brad Dourif because he's the original and the character of Chucky wouldn't be as famous without him, all in all Mark Hamill did a fine job. Overall it's a decent remake nothing more, the original and second are still the best in the franchise for me, and that won't be changing anytime soon. If you haven't seen it give it a watch you might enjoy it or you'll hate it, it's up to as the viewer. 6/10.",Child's Play
258,jadediamond,Pretty good for a remake,9,26 June 2019,"I heard people comment this movie was not as scary as the original. Well, Chucky is a movie about a one foot tall killer doll who goes around killing people and cursing. It was scary when you're eight, but once you grow up, the movie is really funny and ridiculous. This remake was like the It remake meaning it's a reboot of the franchise but it has originality, told its own story, and updated it for a modern audience. Our Chucky was for kids of the eighties and early nineties who loved playing with toys. This movie is for the 21st century kid growing up with smart devices and AI intelligence. Their toys is their smartphones and video game systems with access to the internet. This version of Chucky reflects their generation where a toy is basically Alexa too and can control the technology around it. Mark Hamill does an amazing job voicing Chucky, the annoying buddy friend from hell. Chucky didn't want Andy with no friends. Anyone who threatened to take Andy's best buddy's status or upset Andy had to go. Chucky didn't play with his friendship with Andy. Aubrey Plaza as the young modern day mom and Brian Tyree Henry as their neighbor, Detective Mike Norris was perfectly cast for this crazy, silly movie. I also like Carlease Burke as Doreen Norris, Mike's mom. I'm glad she didn't play the stereotypical black mama role. She was funny in this movie, but she started a beef with Chucky and her scene with him kinda made me laugh then sad because her character was so cool and funny, just like a mom. I like how this movie embraced the silliness of the franchise yet still gave you a few scares. It wasn't scary to me because I've grown desensitized by the violence in real life and the horror genre but I did enjoy this film and I cared about the characters. When you created a horror movie and you make the audience care about the characters, you've done a good job. I liked the Tupac and Star Wars jokes. I might even go on to say there's a Karate Kid joke on the slick, but I might be stretching. The last thirty minutes are very intense and this franchise with a big imagination and creativity has limited opportunities for growth into something bigger. This could be the Terminator of horror movies. But it was a great film with great characters and very funny and enjoyable. If you're a loyalist, then remember, the original franchise is still going on. I've haven't been a fan since Child Play's 3. I didn't like the franchise going straight comedy horror starting with The Bride of Chucky, but plenty of fans love it and it still going strong. But this movie was good reboot or universe separate from the original and I look forward to see where they take these movies.",Child's Play

264,BestBenedikt,A surprisingly fresh take on the Chucky-concept,7,11 September 2019,"I actually enjoyed this way more than I thought I would. Having Chucky be a smart doll, which got manipulated by a Vietnamese blue-collar worker, who got screwed by the economic system and acts out revenge that hits an innocent kid, is way more creative than a run-of-the-mill voodoo-plot we've all seen a thousand times by now.The film also contains a surprising amount of dark humour and overall likeable characters, who were sufficient for a horror B-movie like that. The only thing I probably preferred in the original was Chucky's face, although the idea of making the doll look like one of those female A.I. robots with the uncanny valley facial expressions was in fact again quite clever and satirical. As was the idea that Chucky basically adopted his violent traits from US media and the society surrounding him.I eventually ended up liking this new version of CHILD'S PLAY more than the cheesy original and I would recommend it to anyone, who wants to watch a fun horror flick and isn't obsessed with the romanticized 1988 original.",Child's Play

266,toonyjakes,Ahh what a bummer...,5,17 June 2020,"Chucky is an iconic character that hasnt always gotten the best treatment. In my opinion, I liked the original Child's Play and Bride of Chucky. Child's Play was eerie and intense while Bride was violent and fun. This rendition is kind of in between, just not very charming.Plot- A disgruntled toy programmer disables all behaviorial precautions on a Buddi doll, which is eventually named Chucky. He learns by observation. At first it seemed like the far fetched AI doll idea would become believable and interesting. Instead it just kinda goes haywire in a strange way.Characters/Acting- Aubrey Plaza does great except that she lets herself into it too much. The new Andy is a good actor but not a totally likeable kid. All in all, it had an ""It Chapter 1"" vibe, except awkward. Chucky looks almost odd, yet he is very vell actes by Mark Hammill.Writing- It was written decently well, until things go awry and you hear just about every cliche line ever said.Quality- Cinematography is good, music is okay but nothing amazing, the gore is decent, the thrills are a bit cheap, the story is a bit lazy, and the overall millennial tone of it is odd.All in all, its not a bad flick, I just would never watch it again, and also recommend you see the first instead.

268,Parks,Don't Compare Them,7,26 October 2019,"I think it's a mistake to compare this with the 1988 original. They are actually radically different films. Andy is much older in this film, Chucky is not a vicious serial killer, but a misunderstood AI and all traces of black magic have gone.This is good and it is bad. It does remove some of the cheese factor from the original, but on the other hand, the terror of a small boy being chased by a killer doll is always going to be scarier than a bunch of smart-ass teens trying to out-think a cyber doll.This also plays out in the fact that this Chucky can walk around and talk and no-one can think anything of it. On the one hand, this means there's no big moment where Chucky springs to life. On the other it does mean that Chucky can become slowly creepy in a way he wasn't able to in the original. There are some really excellent moments of horror exploited in this way. As when Chucky sits up, watching Andy and playing the screams of a victim, over and over.On the whole, I think I enjoyed this film for what it was and tried to put the original out of my head. It is rarely very scary, but it does manage to be gorier and more imaginative than I expected. However, I found the climax a little disappointing. I was hoping for more carnage in the store, but it had enough humour and horror, thrills and gore to keep me entertained.And as someone who has always preferred Michael, Jason and Freddy to Chucky, I think I'm going to commit sacrilege and say I prefer this to the 80's horror.

At least in the original, everyone had a reason to think maybe Andy was delusional, and he was also a lot younger and vulnerable. But in this movie, the doll more like a defective product. Why didn't they just destroy it if it was doing really bad stuff? Ridiculous!I like the idea of a crazy AI though. Why didn't they just make their own original film instead of using the Child's Play title to try and get it to sell? By the look of the reviews and score, that didn't help it much.

271,Here_2_Review,"Not a bad Child's Play, but has issues",7,4 July 2019,"I walked in, keeping ULTRA low expectations...... And I was not completely blown away.Firstly, I do appreciate how the makers treated this film as a remake that is COMPLETELY separate from the originals! I mean, they did this wonderfully. It is not just a 2k19 version of the original story, but completely different story, which worked great! The story was intriguing, serving as its own identity, but felt rushed.... I felt that Chucky went full Chucky too quickly, whereas in the 1988 version, it took maybe around the first half of the movie for Chucky to fully go Chucky. It wasn't suspenseful and Andy realized Chucky's full nature and motivation too quickly, whereas in the original, the development was slow and steady. I am also not a fan of how Chucky's name is Chucky because the toy...glitched or the programming was confused? That's just lazy..... Chucky in the original is Charles Lee Ray's nickname....so there you go lolA few characters in this were garbage. Well, as for Shane, he was a garbage person. He was cheating on his wife with an attractive woman like 20+ years younger than him and of course he had kids....so he is that character that deserved to die, and he died horribly..... It was satisfying. Karen, well, I wonder if she knew she was a mistress.... I didn't really much care for her character.... She was okay, but eh. I absolutely....HATED Pugg and Falyn..... I swear they were characters pulled straight out of Nick or Disney Channel, placed into this movie and given an R twist to their personalities.... I hated every scene they were show in.....I also have favorite parts, but when they appeared in these scenes, they totally ruined it for me.... I did really like Mike and I am glad he survived.... Not sure how he survived, but he it! He was totally fun to watch and was a very likeable character overall. Andy himself was pretty decent, although he had some moments that were very off in his performance and was also too goofy.... Chucky was very good as....this kind of character, not possessed, but but a piece of tech that was reprogrammed by a worker who hated his job and probably hated his life, which he no longer had to worry about because reasons.... He did feel like a Chucky, surprisingly, and Mark Hamill did a VERY good job with this take! His voice perfectly fit with this take on Chucky. I originally HATED the Chucky design, but as the movie progressed, as this kind of movie, I got used to the design, and found it ok, but I still prefer the original's...Overall: I give this a 7/10. It is nowhere close to as good or better than the original gems imo, and it had issues, but this movie was pretty decent, and would maybe buy it on blu ray if I keep it in mind to, and would see the sequel if it happens. If I didn't have the issues I have with it, I would probably consider it at least on par. Andy was pretty good, minus some off moments, Mike was great, the rest of the characters are disposable, just disregard the surrounding teens in part 2 and it would be better, Chucky was impressive, Hamill did wonderful. The tone was very rocky sometimes.... Sometimes it was too goofy, sometimes it just felt like a dark comedy, and sometimes it felt like the horror it should be.

285,Millennialprince,Child's Play,8,25 October 2019,"I must say the Child's Play remake exceeded my expectations and that's a good thing. I thought going in this was going to be a shameless cash grab, but the filmmakers actually took the time to make a decent movie. Unlike the original Child's Play, Chucky actually cares about Andy, and he's not a means to an end like he was in the original. Alas, as a corrupted robot Chucky has no concept of good and evil. Of course, in the third act you can argue Chucky fully embraces his evilness.This makes Chucky more of a tragic character and in my humble opinion a far more interesting character. The film also serves as a biting satire on technology and how it will be society's downfall. Of course, this is all surface level stuff the movie is very much a slasher movie albeit a very fun one. Mark Hamill was quite good as the voice of Chucky, he should be commended for not imitating Brad Dourif and doing his own spin on Chucky.",Child's Play

First of all I was expecting a good movie to enjoy but I did not expect it to blow my mind away! lol! OMG! This movie was so good that I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end! It is well worth to see it! I feel like going back to watch it again! lol! I truly had a blast time with this movie! I give it a 9 out of 10 for this movie!Some of you all might think I'm crazy but I think this remake is better than the original. But that's just my opinion. lol!,Child's Play

289,HOPSQUIAT,One of my the best horror remakes I have ever seen.,7,19 December 2020,"I had LOW expectations for this movie. I didn't like Chucky's new look from the trailers, and I am a big fan of the original series (1-Bride of Chucky). But I will say this movie was great. I loved Mark Hamill's Chucky and I think at its core its a movie about friendship and the crazy way we perceive violence in our society.The story is pretty much the same, but they take out the whole voodoo curse element and the body swapping concept. Its really Chucky for the tech age. I really liked the changes. I think even back to the original, if the audience is given doubt as to whether it is Chucky or Andy doing the killing, it would be a more interesting movie. This movie kind of hints at that idea, but we know its Chucky so it is what it is. Andy gets the doll, he likes the doll, doll goes crazy, havoc ensues...Thats the plot.The cast is amazing. Gabriel Bateman is a great actor. He really holds this movie together. If he isn't effective, the movie doesn't work. I love Mark Hamill's Chucky, he is completely different and just as scary. Aubrey Plaza is great and my guy Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) is great in the movie too.As a horror movie, it does have a couple jump scares and it isn't really scary, but its still suspenseful, funny, and fun. Also the Buddi song is amazing. LOVE IT.Check this movie out. I think it is on par with Child's Play 2.Series ranked best to worst

It wasn't terrible and I get the message about A.I etc and Aubry Plaza was brilliant as always. But I don't see the point in this film, it's average at best. The Chucky series just recently had a few more instalments, but I'm guessing they're irrelevant now.
A few nice call backs tbf, but it needed to be Charles Lee Ray, not that Hamill doesn't do a good job it just wasn't on par with the original series. I also don't think the reason Chucky is evil has the same gravitas as then originals either.
So as a stand alone film if you haven't seen the originals I'd say 5 maybe 6/10 if you have seen the originals it doesn't compare at 3 maybe 4/10.",Child's Play
291,HairyMart1,Robo Chucky,5,22 June 2019,"So here we go with a relaunch of the Chucky franchise, a moderately successful series of films based on the idea of a child's toy possessed by the spirit of a demented serial killer. This time things are updated to give it a, if the phrase can be used, more grounded approach of the basis of the murder spree being due to a technical glitch in a robotic toy, voiced by Mark Hamill. While the new concept and story basis is quite well handled, too much time is probably spent in creating a backstory for the murder spree so things do not really get going until the last third. Further the work on the back stories has sone inconsistencies, and potentially inventive ideas, that are for some reason never really developed. Some inventive killings means that for the horror fan it'll be and ok watch, but for most I believe it would be a disappointing experience.",Child's Play
292,sean-curtin-517-748378,A film to up-chuck upon.,1,6 April 2020,"SIGH!!!!The only way I could think of to start this review. Firstly it brings up a constantly pondered upon statement we all know. ""If it aint broke, don't fix it."" There is no more truth that can be spoken of for this pale imitation of the original.-> SPOILERS<- Although not really because this entire movie is pretty much a spoiler. Look the actors have done there best, the movie was done to the best of the creators ability but it just pails in comparison to the original. (Also the fact it cost 10 Million bucks to make is another travesty and waste of good film making money, which adds to the 'up-chuck' issues of this film.)Alright in all fairness, I'm a big fan of the original movie and all it's terrific sequels and the fact it doesn't have a single second of Brad Dourif is probably it's worst downfall to even begin with but fellow fans, it get's worse from there.Firstly of all, gone is the ultra creepy and forever freaky voodoo spell which puts the actual soul of a serial killer into the body of a doll. Oh no, what this movie gives us is...... wait for it..... wait for it....... here you go..... the programmer of the doll, takes off all the safeties. Yep, seriously that's it, that's what makes this version of Chucky so bad. LAME DELUXE, oh yeah and it just keeps getting worse.Gone is the absolute terror of Andy, replaced with a disadvantaged partially deaf kid. REALLY, does even a horror movie have to have woke politically correct do dads in it these days or it can't be made or something????? Does it make the character better? NOPE. Does it increase the horror? NOPE. Does it even, dare I say it, make the movie more terrifying? NOPE. In face it assists this movie in falling into the category of 'COMEDY.'Seriously, I laughed from beginning to end with this lamo interpretation and I felt sorry for the actress Aubrey Plaza(she plays Andy's widowed mum) who is brilliant and every other role I've ever seen her in but in particular the film 'Safety Not Included.' Aubrey, gives the role her all but seriously, it was so beneath her I almost couldn't watch.The whole film then goes through a bunch of really cheesy scenes which again pail in comparison to the original, the horror scenes are all laughable and there's simply nothing really chilling about this film. I can only hope that a sequel from this incantation never get's given the green light because it's an abomination and an insult to the original which is still brilliant all these years later.AI versus psycho soul of a killer, sorry guys, trying to write Brad Dourif out of one of his star roles because you were to cheap to pay him was a MEGA bad move and I hope you all felt the hurt that the low return has proven this flop to be.Here's hoping it never sees the light of day again and remains a bad memory to fellow fans like myself who know our Chucky and this aint it.Childs crap play more like it.",Child's Play
293,ArdentViewer,Fear Not the Doll but the Monopolies,6,17 December 2020,"I was struck by this movie in an unanticipated way. Never having seen any of the original ""Child's Play"" films but being vaguely familiar with the premise, I'd say that the movie more than fulfilled my expectations of horror, blood, gore, and a menacing toy (read: wasn't expecting a slasher pic but thatmight be my fault).I enjoyed a second, more sophisticated layer of fear conveyed by the looming threat of technology uniting to defeat humanity. Sure, that story has been told before, but maybe not quite in this way. In the age of smart technology, interconnectivity, and few mega-corporations exerting control over the market, it is easy to imagine this type of threat being more science-fact than science-fiction. It is common knowledge that our devices and apps monitor and record our behavior and suggest curated products/content. But what if all devices in our home were controlled by a single common platform (this may already be the case for those more trendy than me)? What if a nefarious entity managed to control every product and device everywhere, and used them for a hostile takeover? Violent or not, this is a version of reality that is as fathomable as it is terrifying. I think back to the scene in ""I, Robot"" (2004!) where Will Smith's character refuses to utilize any automated devices, as rudimentary as they were depicted back then. I have such kinship for him in that moment. This aspect of the film gave me more food for thought than I would have surmised.Forgetting the technological feasibility of the actions ""Chucky,"" which I am not qualified to judge, I did take issue with what I consider an obvious flaw. How many kids/tweens live in households where fancy knife block sets are accessible for everyday use in the preparation of PB&J sandwiches? Come on now. I know Chucky needed to learn to stab to move the plot forward (and possibly to remain consistent with the previous films), but this seemed awfully contrived. Who uses heavy-duty knives to slice a sandwich and then leaves the knives out?I was also disappointed with Aubrey Plaza's character. Given who she often plays, I was expecting her be a lively badass. Instead she was kind of a clueless, absentee mom who worried more about her boyfriend than her child for much of the film. She was bland and passive abd made bad decisions. I wish her characterization could have risen to the level of her son. I get that sometimes the adults have to be maddeningly dull so the kids can shine (and they did here) but it would have been a nice change of pace to have the ignorant mom role be reimagined along with the backstory.",Child's Play
294,beatlesjoerd,It's okay but nothing special,6,24 May 2020,"The movie for the most part is pretty good, mostly chucky itself is great. But the problem this movie has is the weird ending, the only thought i had during the ending was: just don't make it cliche, suprise me. But it was predictable and that is a real shame.",Child's Play
295,stuart-smith729,A very poor effort,1,16 October 2019,"The only redeeming factor was seeing Texas chainsaw but even that was chopped and in the wrong order.A very poor take on chucky, you rarely or barely see him up and running about. Im not too sure what Mark Hammil was trying to achieve but the voice was dreadful and he even look poor.A weak and boring take on the original, there is nothing i can say to recommend this. A very poor effort.",Child's Play
296,sagniknath,An enjoyable remake that fits nicely in the contemporary era,7,23 June 2019,"I really went in with meager expectations for this. But I was surprised at how entertaining this was. The Chucky lore is perfectly modernized by ditching the supernatural theme in the original movie and replacing it with a more befitting evil AI , something which syncs perfectly with the modern era of Internet of Things.Mark Hamill delivers an enjoyable voice performance. It' doesn't sound as demonic as in the original but more like the Joker from the Batman animated series under the influence of weed. Which is perfect. The lighting and background score help lend a sort of nightmarish quality to the film's setting.I thought Aubrey Plaza wouldn't work as a believable mom but she was alright too.In terms of complaints, I guess the main would be that Chucky really doesn't have a very strong motivation to turn evil and kill people. In the original, it sort of made sense because he inherited the soul of a dead serial killer. Here, I really expected a more concrete impetus to slaughter victims other than them simply being an a apparent impediment to a close bond between Chucky and Andy.
Also, while the overused cliche of the ""son up against the mom's boyfriend"" is used to create a central conflict, I wish it were fleshed out more . We really needed to see Andy feel more frustrated and disturbed by the boyfriend to help evoke a more effective catharsis.But still, in the end, I wasn't bored by any minute of this movie. Scenes which I thought could potentially drag on were thankfully shortened, almost as if the filmmaker was aware of this.So go ahead, enjoy the movie. It does bring something new to the table",Child's Play
297,WillsFilms,Child's Play Is A Slice Of Fun,8,25 June 2019,"Is this movie going to win any oscars? No. Is this film a fun time at the cinema? Hell yeah! Child's Play is a well made retelling of the 1988 Classic. While I enjoyed the original, I believe that this film is superior in almost every way. This film has better acting, writing and main characters. Gabriel Bateman is an incredible young actor and plays a version of Andy, who is much older than the character from the original, who was six. Bateman's Andy is an interesting and relatable character, with compelling struggles and flaws, while the original Andy was just a cute kid. Aubrey Plaza is also a much better version of Karen. While the original Karan has more screen time and plays a larger role in the third act, Plaza plays the role with much more personality and her smaller role works with Andy's larger personality and more personal dynamic with Chucky. Speaking of which, Chucky's dynamic with the Andy is the best part of the film. Unlike the original, where Chucky was planning on killing Andy right from the start, this Chucky genuinely cares about Andy and making him happy. He becomes infuriated and jealous when Andy starts development larger friendships than his one with Chucky. I am conflicted on which version of Chucky I prefer. Brad Dourif bought so much energy and charisma to the role, which he would continues to play over thirty years later. However, Mark Hamil is one of the best living voice actors and he is phenomenal in this movie. Chucky is also a far more interesting and sympathetic character in this movie, as all he wants is Andy's friendship and love. I prefer Dourif's voice performance, but I prefer Chucky, in this film, as a character.One character I felt was better in the original was Detective Mike Norris. In the original, he was a badass. He was constantly investigating Chucky's murders and he was the biggest threat to Chucky in that film. In this movie, Norris is purely the comic relief. He does have a few serious moments, (including one which I wish was longer, but can't mention because it's a pretty big spoiler) but he's far from the intelligent, awesome character from the original.The kills were incredible. Many of them were creative and all were gory. The blood looked convincing and Chucky was genuinely intimidating in all of those scenes.As for flaws, Chucky's design did not look very convincing. The doll from the original looked more convincing than the messy 2019 doll put before our eyes in this film. Also, many of Andy's friends, while not as out of place as a lot of critics are saying, are quite annoying. Especially Marlon Kazadi's Omar, who I wanted to die; painfully.In summary, I really enjoyed Child's Play. It's a solid horror film and a remake that surpasses the original. The doll has a poor design and there are a few annoying characters, made up for by great writing, interesting main characters and great kills. I definitely recommend this movie, it's not a masterpiece of filmmaking, but it is an enjoyable horror film that you'll probably have fun with. Trust me, I'm your friend to the end.",Child's Play
298,patrickbivona,Mehhh,5,22 September 2019,"Not a terrible remake, but the writting and character development is non existant. Die hard Chucky fans may hate it due to the lack of Chuck's personality. But it is worth a rental, not a buy.",Child's Play
299,HorrorFreak1997,"this one will likely alienate chucky purists, but it offers a breath of fresh air for those of you looking for some deviation from the old formula.",7,17 March 2021,"I will begin my review by saying, I'm a fan of the franchise and have seen every entry leading up to this 2019 reboot. in my opinion the two best chucky films to date are the original Childs play and Child's play 2. the other films offered some fun here and there but definitely didn't reach that watermark set by the first two movies.When sitting down to watch this latest entry, my expectations were quite low. but to my surprise I ended up really enjoying this new updated version of chucky. This time around Chucky isn't a doll possessed by the spirit of a deranged serial killer, he's instead an AI who's not functioning properly. in the title to this review I noted that chucky purists may be disappointed by this entry, and this is one the reasons. by removing the ""soul in the doll"" aspect this does change something that was a big part of the original movies. but is it really that bad of a change? for me I was just excited to see something different.Chucky's new upgraded abilities for example. because he's an AI he capable of taking control over other electronics nearby, which opens up new ways to build tension, new ways to kill, new ways to make these deaths look accidental, etc. so in that regard, the movie was pretty entertaining and the third act, shows us just how much havoc Chucky can cause with his new abilities.The Andy character is a few years older in this version and therefore is a more formidable opponent for Chucky. He also has a small group of friends in this one that assists him in taking down chucky and also provide some comic relief here and there. this was also an interesting little change that was made that kind of helped keep things different and entertaining. cause at the end of the day, when it comes to these reboots, too similar to the original is also not good.This film like the first two offers some scenes with genuine tension and some pretty good creepy little moments and the death scenes are as expected.. very, very brutal.overall I really enjoyed this one. I still would say the first two Child's play movies are the best but I think this one sits right below those two. this one is much better than the majority of the direct to video sequels of recent years and definitely better than the more comedic chucky entries like bride and seed of chucky. 7/10 from me",Child's Play

301,ratpackaustin,Could've been a 10/10 if they let mark hamill go crazy,7,27 June 2019,"This film was very good. Not as good as the original, but better than everyone anticipated it to be. There were only two issues with it in my opinion.The first is how Chucky becomes evil. They took out the supernatural side of the story and replaced it with technology, ok cool it modernizes it no problem. But he just becomes evil because a pissed of employee removes safety protocols? Why do kids dolls even have the ability to commit violence? A protocol shouldn't need to exist for that. And in doing it this way it also removes the personality out of Chucky and instead makes him a cyborg. Which feeds into the second point.Second gripe is how restricted mark hamill seems in this role. With Chucky being an AI he really only gives limited responses throughout the whole movie. He says some swear words and creepy things, but mostly only by repeating what other characters say. He feels like a parrot instead of a living being, and it takes away from the character. In the original Chucky's first lines as a doll were swears and violent threats towards Andy's mom, and it's amazing and shows the violence inside him. But in this one it seems like Chucky can't form his own sentences.Overall I loved this movie and hope to see another where they really let mark hamill lose.",Child's Play

The new version had some positives. The high tech/smart devices were a nice update. It was a good idea to make the doll linked to other stuff, and able to learn. Also in the new version, the story of how the doll turns bad is more practical or believable.
Unfortunately the rest of the movie doesn't deliver. A couple scenes stopped being scary and actually became silly.

There was no real character development, people were jokey at innapropriate times to make it a horror. Characters that died, I didn't really care for, they bring people in with no real relevance and then kill them off.
Why did the granny get killed in the car? She just had tea with the Andy? Surely Chucky should have killed the kid that was punching Andy?

313,tyreeewebster,An Enjoyably Cheesy Piece of Trash!,4,3 July 2019,"In 1988, we were introduced to the killer doll CHUCKY in Tom Holland's 'Child's Play'; in the film, a young boy named Andy Barclay receives a present on his birthday in the form of a playful Good Guy Doll, who is in fact possessed by the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray. Once Chucky's true intentions are revealed, it is up to Andy's mother Karen and Detective Mike Norris to stop the doll from doing whatever it wants to do.The film was a critical and financial success, and proved so popular that it was followed by a string of sequels of varying quality. Child's Play 2 in 1990 was a solid follow up which cemented Chucky's charming personality and the humorous tone the series would be known for, Child's Play 3 was rushed to screens as a tired and clunky threequel which failed in the public eye, Bride of Chucky was a return to form, adding comedy to the mix, Seed of Chucky was... just bizarre, and Curse and Cult of Chucky returned back to form, proving that there was still life in the little red-headed terror!Of course, after 30 years, Chucky was due for a remake. How does it hold up? Well...Let's discuss the major changes to the premise... and it IS major. In the original film, Chucky is brought to life through the magic of voodoo. A very silly concept, but it worked in its execution because it immediately established lore and a motive you could get behind. Charles Lee Ray was dying, so he transferred his soul into this innocent doll, and the rest of the story takes shape. This one goes for an updated, and somewhat more realistic approach.In this version, Chucky is a My Buddi doll that is a high tech gadget for kids. He can play and sit with your child and control your TV and other device, etc. His programming goes haywire because of a disgruntled employee and that is why he is given sadistic tendencies. It's far fetched, and gets VERY far fetched later in the film. Overall, the premise works well. I found it to be an inventive concept. It's not perfectly executed, but it meshes well for the story the filmmakers wanted to tell... and it gives Chucky a sense of power over his prey and actually lets us have a very thrilling climax.The score was written and composed by Bear McCreary of The Walking Dead and is excellent. It conveys the sweetness and creepiness whenever needed and the film incorporates its themes perfectly. I can't fault this score. As an added bonus, anybody who follows Bear McCreary on social media knows that he created this score entirely out of children's toys, and the result is nothing more than unique and inventive. I sincerely hope that McCreary is awarded for his efforts at the Academy Awards because the entire score was a stroke of genius.No film would be anything at all if it weren't for the actors, and the characters that they portray. In this instance, the characters are near enough the same as the original film.Andy Barclay is played by young actor Gabriel Bateman, and is noticeably a lot older than his 1988 counterpart, which makes the idea that he is given a doll as a birthday present kind of ridiculous. But a line spoken mentions the ridiculousness of it and they play it off as a joke gift. Bateman plays the character well and comes across as a very intelligently written and sympathetic lead. Andy's mother, Karen is portrayed by Aubrey Plaza, who I initially thought of as too young for this role, but again, they mention it as some kind of teen pregnancy, which adds to the ""struggling mum"" angle effectively. She played her part well, but I felt that he was horrendously underused. On a plus side, she has great chemistry with her on-screen son.There's a batch of Stranger Things kids who are tacked on, underdeveloped and uninteresting so I'm not going to dabble on them too much. They were fine. Some supporting players are very over the top, but the stand out performance HAS to go to Brian Tyree Henry as Detective Mike Norris. Never in a modern horror film has there ever been a more charismatic, charming, funny and completely likable character than this iteration of the character. He acts as a true friend for Andy, and provides a lot of comic relief.Like Plaza though, he is really underused. He is sort of in and out to look at dead bodies, and there isn't really a showcase of his detective skills. I would have much preferred he be given a beefier role, and perhaps have him be the main focus that we follow throughout the story.Finally, lets get to Chucky himself. Now, I know that replacing Brad Dourif as the voice of the titular doll was always going to be a kick in the balls. Dourif is simply irreplaceable. However, casting a powerhouse voice over performer like Mark Hamill was always going to deliver good results. Hamill gives us a kudos performance as not only a creepy Chucky, but a sweet, kind-hearted Chucky, too. As this version is an out of control AI, and he adapts to his environment and Andy, I found him entirely endearing. Unfortunately, his character does NOT grow into the quip-happy maniacal Chucky we have grown to love. He actually stays the same naïve doll throughout and it simply doesn't fit. He comes off as like a child. It doesn't work. He needed to evolve.Let's talk about the cinematography a little bit, director Lars Klevberg and cinematographer Brendan Eugama delivered a nicely shot, visually stunning horror film that had no right to look as good as it did. It's always great when every frame in a film like this makes you interested in what you're seeing. Let's be honest, nobody walks into a slasher film expecting good cinematography, and I'm glad that they didn't go for a gritty, shaky Platinum Dunes look.I've spoken about the Chucky character, now lets talk about his look... it's bad... really, really bad. Chucky looks so cheap, and there is no emoting from the puppet and he just looks weird. There are a few shots where he looks fine, and of course when he is just a doll he looks good. But seeing this thing barely move it's face for an hour and a half, it just looks silly. Supposedly the production team spent six weeks building Chucky and it definitely shows. He is seriously ugly. No parent would want to buy this. I'd slap my mom across the face if she bought me this. I'd rather have a cuddle with the movie version of Sonic the Hedgehog.... before the fixes.The film almost makes up for it with some really brutal and inventive kills. But, I wont spoil them for you here.For my final thoughts of the film I am very mixed. I saw it with my brother and he absolutely hated it, which made for a fun discussion afterwards. All I can say is that this film is purely schlock of the highest order. Its script is clunky, performances are over the top at times, it's got a ridiculous premise, it's gory and the effects suck.I was entertained. I enjoyed the film and I laughed a lot. And, if a film like this can make me laugh and entertain me... then it's done its job.I'm glad that this movie is successful; I'm looking forward to possible sequels. I give it 3 out of 5 and I hope you get the same enjoyment out of it as I did.",Child's Play

I've seen this movie twice in two days and might be going to see it again soon. This movie has the gore from Curse Of Chucky (2013) and Cult of Chucky (2017) with the personality of Chucky from Child's Play (1988). Mark Hamill was amazing as Chucky. The storyline had a fun variation on the original, possessed Chucky and is just so fun. There's even a scene that makes you feel for Chucky.. it's weird... Aubrey Plaza was amazing as Karen, a single mother raising a child, and all the actors were amazing in general. The movie has subtle humor throughout and it's hard to write a review on this film without spoiling it. The trailer doesn't even give much of anything away! It's such a good movie and better than the original. (Which is saying something)",Child's Play
315,shaun_lime,Best Friend,7,25 September 2019,"Well that impressed me and I love the new tech design behind Chucky that fitted great with the plot and the doll itself looked more realistic that made him more creepy and definitely a lot gory than the original.Hands down I'll always love the original two but this reboot powers over the rest of the Chucky franchise.I definitely prefer the original voice actor because I thought he was so much more comical but (mark hamill) did do a good job thought and love that they used face motion along with his voice because you could tell it was mark hamill all over.

Plus having Mark Hamil voice Chucky is an added bonus. People hating on this movie forget that the original movies have always been campy.I like the new direction and all the modern upgrades are a nice touch. No more Charles Lee Ray or voodoo or body possession, but it's a nice twist. They deserve credit for trying something different and not just rehashing the old storyline.

321,filmsbyq,Unnecessary remake.,3,13 April 2020,"Child's Play is rubbish and an absolute waste of time. The original version is not even very good but was at least novel for its time and spawned several sequels. This 're-boot' - a lazy excuse for a film - adds nothing and does not improve on the original even slightly. Unlike the remake of Carrie, which was up against a horror classic, Child's Play actually had scope for improvement.Instead, written by Tyler Burton Smith from a story by Don Mancini, the writer of the original film, Smith makes very little effort to stamp his own personality on proceedings. The script is pedestrian at best, with many of the story elements making very little sense.Some of the killings are shoved in just to make up the numbers - Gabe, Doreen - the Korean opening was nonsensical, taking the safety elements off of a toy as though it were a nuclear missile.If the film had gone for parody it might have worked. Directed by Lars Klevberg - who also directed the far better Polaroid - walks us through this horror by numbers, with barely any of the scares working and easily predictable. The acting is fine given the material and nobody on show is noticeably awful but I suspect that, unless they were big fans of the original, most of the adults at least only turned up for the pay cheque.Child's Play is a lazy, uninspired, pointless remake of an okay horror that did not need to be remade. Definitely, one to give a miss.",Child's Play

Chucky really acts stupid even for a robot lol. But its nothing like the old, but in its own story form sad kid not getting much attention from mom, she bes with some loser of a man, the doll just kills due to how he sees and ways Andy is seeing other people and how he reacts he reacts if their mean to him he seems to want to protect andy and stuff then when andy rejects him he feels andy is malfunctioned too but at least the black guy lived and the kids and Andy is badazz so it was fun and really funny Chucky is really dumb even for robot in early on which i enjoy laughing he was funny.

328,JasonXIX,We Deserve Better,5,20 September 2019,"The movie starts with an interesting concept, as the doll is using its AI to learn and adapt from its surroundings. The constant negativity, pain, and violence of its surroundings somewhat turns the doll into a killer. I guess this is some type of commentary on society, but it is never explored further.Any interesting ideas are quickly abandoned to create another generic, hokey, jump-scare type horror movie. None of the characters are developed, and we couldn't care less what happens to them. 'Chucky' somehow looks less frightening compared to the original movie, and has even less personality. There are some good, gory kills, but not enough to justify this movies existence. As horror fans, we deserve better than these constantly bland, unoriginal horror movies.",Child's Play

335,drawnsupreme,What is this garbage,1,22 September 2019,"The original Child's Play was very, very creepy. Dark. Violent. Very violent. Unpredictable. Mixed with great acting, a unique story, and exceptional directing, and really we had a classic on our hands.This 2019 reboot took everything that made the original great, and tossed it out the window. Chucky is now a terminator and we got a predictable story that felt toned down and much more kiddy.Chucky should be ULTRA VIOLENT - period! This movie toned down the violence so much that it could almost pass off as a PG-13 flick. It focuses much more on emotions and drama than horror, making this feel like a sad, watered-down, filtered attempt to modernize the Child's Play franchise. It didn't work.The horror and gore sequences felt cheap, and not as violent as what we've scene in the previous Child's Play movies. Not even close. Just when you think you're going to see Chucky go on an all-out stabbing-spree, scene fades to black. Even the direct-to-video movies did much, much better - and stayed true to the horror elements that make Chucky a horror icon. This 2019 reboot fails here, yet again.My advice to Hollywood: Bring back Brad Dourif and make Chucky great again, because this was an awful attempt to modernize a classic horror franchise. Brad actually made Chucky feel scary whenever he was on screen, something that I felt was missing in this reboot - sorry Mark Hamill! The fits of rage, the ambition to get things done, everything Brad Dourif did was just so much better. Hollywood, you need to up the violence and scary-looking imagery by tenfold. Get Chucky to express RAGE. Get better writers, because this story was boring as hell. This whole movie should have been thrown in the garbage.The acting from Andy and his mother was alright, bonus point for that, but everything else falls flat on this sorry excuse for a reboot. Skip it. This is complete trash - and if you're a hardcore fan, you're going to be highly disappointed.",Child's Play
336,mckinleybrooksmorton,They shouldn't have tried to make a morinic Luddite's version of Stranger Things,3,17 March 2020,"I'm going to try to avoid going into too much detail, but I'm pretty hot after watching this film.
From the first frame, you know this film is going to be a piece of crap. The film is about an AI doll that goes Hal-ish and a comedy of errors ensues. But, the thing is, Chucky is horrifying from the moment we get a glimpse of his face. The doll is evil incarnate, which nullifies the scare factor, making this f#$&ing hilarious. Which is why I gave it three stars. Also, it is completely unbelievable that anyone would actually manufacture such a doll legitimately for children.I found myself feeling sorry for the actors, each of the veterans trying their best to fight through bad dialogue, and, what one can only assume was mediocre direction based on the consistently bad sequences which involved people talking to eachother.
This film caused me to stop and actually think about what the original Child's Play was actually about. I concluded it had more to do with socioeconomic factors pressuring an already disintigrated archetype of the nuclear family. But, the thing is, I have seen the original Child's Play well over twenty times, and never once did I stop in the middle of the film and think about what the film was saying about modern culture, the natured of American culture, or about the possibility of how it related to the depletion of the environment, because I was too busy being caught up in the film. Simple. Very, very simple.
Whereas, the 2018 Child's Play forces viewers to stop at every moment, whether it is a result of the terrifyingly-uncanny-to-the-point-of-madness look of Chucky, the forced grouping of the kids, bizarrely awkward dialogue, or the painful subtext rooted in society's anxiety toward AI, viewers will be forced to look at ""the movie"", not experience the story.",Child's Play

That's what I loved about this film the most, aside from the comedy which was pretty similar and reminded me a lot of ""IT"". The bond that Mark Hamill's Chucky had with Gabriel Bateman's 'Andy' was so Wholesome and I just found It very intriguing and likeable. This didn't seem to tap into the horror genre either, it was more of a thriller/comedy with a dash of drama.

Not one person from the original 7 movies makes an appearance. The most noticeable is the absence of Brad Douriff as the voice of Chucky. Mark Hamill does a fine job, but this just isn't Chucky. It's not funny, it's not even fun. It just is another horror remake on par with the reboots of Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street.It's meh. It's fine.

Why didn't anyone help the mom in the car? They were all there when her car went out of control.3. Wasted such a good voice actor by not making Chucky's voice maniacal, at all. He sounded nice the whole time... in the original they played with the voice as a tool to scare.4. How does the janitor have cameras in everyone's house?5. Why does the face skin from the boyfriend have teeth and eyes??6. Why was Andy deaf? Just so Chucky could talk in his ear at the end??7. If Chucky was learning from things around him in order to get his evil ways, how did he know to do all the psychotic things he did?8. They kept basically nothing from the original.The only good thing about this: Andy, mom, the Detective and all the kids lived.I really wanted this film to be an important AI cautionary tale but it just went south fast.This movie was a total waste.

343,Gorgorgorgoroth,Better Than the Last 5 Chucky Films,5,27 June 2019,"This is definitely better than most horror remakes and the last 5 Chucky films. I really don't care that Don Mancini is the creator of the Child's Play franchise, I never liked Child's Play 3, Bride, Seed, Curse, and Cult of Chucky. I hate how the Child's Play is becoming way too comedic and doesn't take itself seriously at all. I'm glad people finally decided to take Chucky to a whole new direction without Don Mancini's involvement.The Good:The movie focuses a lot on the relationship between Andy and Chucky. The original Child's Play doesn't focus on this relationship because Chucky is always trying to manipulate Andy. But in this remake, Chucky actually wants to be Andy's best friend and always tries to please Andy in the first half of the film.Mark Hamill does a fine job providing the voice of Chucky.The movie has a fair amount of humor. It doesn't try too hard to be funny unlike Seed of Chucky (Jesus, that movie is terrible!)The showdown between Andy and Chucky at the end of the film is very fun to watch.The music is great! Bear McCreary did a good job composing the theme for this film.The Bad:Chucky's origin is just lazy writing. Some guy in Vietnam who works at a toy factory gets yelled at and insulted by his boss, so the employee decides to turn off all of Chucky's safety features, then he kills himself by jumping off a building and lands on a car, similar to Chucky's first kill in the original film.Pugg and Falyn are pointless. The film wouldn't be that different if these two characters were removed from the story. Falyn doesn't do much in the film but when Chucky controls other toys in Zed Mart to kill people, Falyn finally decides to be a badass. Pugg is the most annoying character. He tries to be funny but fails, and he serves absolutely no purpose at all.When Chucky is controlling Doreen's Kaslan car and makes the car drive recklessly, how does no one notice this in the parking lot?Why do the Kaslan chopper toys have sharp rotor blades? How is this appropriate for children to play with?Apparently, the Buddi Bear dolls have the strength to pull someone's body?How does Chucky have the strength and time to tie Karen up and tie the noose to the forklift? The film never shows this.Overall, the film is ok. I had a lot of fun watching the film but the film still has a lot of flaws. I am definitely looking forward to the sequel.",Child's Play
344,amandagellar-31077,Shockingly Good Remake,8,2 July 2019,"I need to get this off my chest first - I love the original Child's Play series. Don Mancini has managed to keep that franchise alive for 30 years and keep it fresh and entertaining (and I can't wait for the upcoming TV series), which is why I feel like a traitor for saying that this new Child's Play movie is ridiculously good and way better than it has any right to be, but it's the truth.The makers of this revamped Child's Play have brought Chucky into our modern world and have a few twists and turns up their sleeves. Now, Chucky is an AI doll who can control pretty much any household device (even cars) and that adds an extra degree of threat to the story.The acting is uniformly good with Aubrey Plaza taking a break from her usual surly, sarcastic persona and playing a concerned young mother. The set pieces are exciting and well executed and the music score is fairly catchy as well.Even if you're a fan of the original series, give this one a shot. It's one of the few remakes (along with The Thing, The Fly, The Blob, and The Hills Have Eyes) to be able to stand proudly alongside the original as something different and unique.",Child's Play

347,KillerRomance,CHUCKY IS BACK IN THE NEW AGE BABY! #CHUCKYFOREVER,10,23 July 2020,"I seen this movie twice on the day of the movie theater release on June 21. I witnessed the 1988 version being born and released when I was ten years old and been a Chucky Fan. What a comeback! A brilliant year for Chucky.
The Brief synopsis is the actual original Don Mancini story called ""blood Buddy"" about a Doll being controlled by the Boy's rage but a more up dated plot. Instead of the Serial Killer Soul of Charles Lee Ray and Voodoo added by Tom Holland, you got Mancini's plot outline. Is it better than the original? In most ways, yes! because here is why:
1) The Music Score by Bear McCreary is the greatest Music Score for a Child's Play movie ever, you put that with Brad Dourif yelling at Chris Sarandon with this 2019 Music Score, it is phenomenal. So good Job, Bear!
2) Audrey Plaza plays a young Mother which reflects in society how easy going parents are with their kids and that creates Chucky being what he is when Andy does what he wants, like all children do when watching adult horror movies when they should not. Andy has more to do in this movie and much better than Alex Vincent for sure! Audrey is calmer than Catherine Hicks who screams her lungs and has a fit of rage, Audrey has a cooler but effective approach.
3) Mark Hamill is brilliant as Chucky the A.I. who is learning about his surroundings, how to please Andy, you see a bond between them whereas in the original movie and sequels in the nineties it was pure manipulation.
I never thought I would say this in a million years but you actually feel sorry for Chucky, I felt like I want to hug him.
I love the different aspect to Chucky, it's fresh, it's new, Mark Hamill did a Brad Dourif-esque voice but really made Chucky his own. As a Brad Dourif fan for 30 years and his other movies like Mississippi Burning, Exorcist 3, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, Desire the Vampire, and Istanbul, I forgot about Brad and really got into it. I always had my faith in Mark Hamill and glad I did.
4) Scary scenes and carnage candy is here alright! The Christmas Lights! The Buddi Bears are the highlights out of the few, the death scenes are creative and fantastic. In the Chucky movies, there is always one or two death scene and wise cracks you will remember. The 2019 version there are all that you will recall for months including the one-liners from Chucky.
5) That Buddi Song is addictive and stuck in my mind for weeks, I will play it for my future child.
6) I love the Characters, Wes the co worker of Audrey Plaza that puts on this big puppet head at Z-Mart to entertain kids, and Detective Norris
Negatives: Andy's Friends are annoying and I am not warm to them.
Overall thought: Great Photography and lighting, creative fresh look on Chucky, sequel to come with more Buddi Bears and Black Buddi Dolls for Child's Play 2. I appreciate the original and 2019 reboot. Pity Don Mancini, Alex Vincent, Jennifer Tilly, Christine Elise had to split fans up on Twitter thinking we won't watch his TV series in 2020 because this movie was a real treat especially for Chucky Fans who are 34 years old that were too young to watch Chucky on the big screen in the Nineties and surely this movie won't get in the way so I can't understand why they have to dampen our excitement. Chucky was dying a slow painful death on DVD and this Reboot was needed. Don was credited twice at the end credits roll and he is getting royalties for it. Ignore all negativity and enjoy this movie because you won't be disappointed.

But, is the new movie bad like some thought it would be? Well, does anyone remember the 1998 remake of 'Godzilla'? I like to think of that movie is a perfect analogy. As a 'Child's Play' movie, it's one of the worst things ever conceived. As its own movie, however, it's entertainingly bad. The kills were cool, the acting was good, and there were some bright spots to help make this version stand out. Just keep in mind that it's the lackluster effects, lack of consistency and the lack of scares that will eventually make this version forgotten. To be fair though, it could've been worse.

The new digital format, to me anyway, nullifies any visual tension and threat because the imagery appears too polished.So when you pair a non-scary script with a non-threatening glossy look, you simply have the making of a dreadless horror movie. Child's Play (2019) suffers with this.The following selection of horror remakes bear the same non-threatening production when compared to the original:The Amityville Horror (2004); The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006); The Wicker Man (2006); A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010); The Wolfman (2010); Evil Dead (2012); Poltergeist (2015); Pet Sematary (2019).Simply stick with Child's Play (1988).

353,MarkoutTV,This... wasn't bad,6,24 September 2019,"When you see a movie that has split reviews of 10 stars, calling it brilliant and 1 star, calling it an abominable dumpster fire, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.This is an instance of exactly that.Unlike most, I actually dug the premise. Instead of the doll being possessed, it was a malfunctioning AI that listens to what you have to say and interprets it in the worst possible ways. As someone with a healthy concern for AI, why not? I'm with it.The one casualty of this is that since the doll doesn't take the personality of a psychotic adult and instead is much more robotic, a lot of the crass humor of the original Chucky is gone, making this film a whole lot less (intentionally) funny.However, the degredation of Chucky's programming in this movie is paced really well and for the most part works, a lot of the deaths are pretty creative and the tension scenes are pulled off much better than they had any right to. I was expecting to scoff at most of the movie and instead I watched the whole thing silently, happily so. It was a quick and perfectly consumable horror flick.Perfect though, it is not. Some of the moments stretch logic beyond the limit, some of the dialogue is a bit meh and the ending is kinda weak, but awful? Nah. Maybe it's the low expectations but as a horror movie it's completely solid. Best one I've seen this year no doubt, which I guess is easy when the only other one I've seen this year was It Chapter 2, but this is sincerely enjoyable.",Child's Play

New Origin on Chucky, New Story, Original Kills and characters we cared for and some we couldn't wait to see get killed.Though I will always get loyal and faithful to the Original Movies (even the bad ones), Child's Play 2019 is a Really Good Horror with scares and laughs and some surprising touching moments.",Child's Play

356,blatherskitenoir,They learn what we teach them,7,21 June 2019,"A solid and entertaining remake, with some fresh differences to keep it from being an exact copy. Child's Play 2019 mixes the original with a heavy dose of Smart House 1999 as the human characters realize how quickly the portions of their lives they happily signed over to the internet of things can go horribly, horribly wrong with the smallest of glitches.
Chucky is an AI doll with all of his behavior restrictions lifted. Literally an infant experiencing the world for the first time, Chucky begins the film with a naive innocence that twists as he absorbs, and misunderstands, the lessons his Best Friend Andy and other negative influences feed into him. Chucky can download the entire internet into his brain, and we've turned the internet into a pit of the hot garbage of the worst of us.
With the understanding of a toddler, Chucky sees people laughing at the gore in a campy slasher film, and tries to recreate it for laughs. Chucky is, after all, designed to entertain.
We watch Chucky evolve and form his own sense of desire and reason, and then experience the terror when we realize he has learned exactly what we taught him and has the power to do whatever he wants.
Fans of 80's horror will appreciate the style of the film, which relies heavily on practical animatronics, giving Chucky a very real-feeling presence on screen. The film also has the type of over-the-top, campy-gore deaths common of 80's slasher films, giving the movie a delightful level of schlock.
Fans of the original may mourn the loss of the snarky, irreverent one-liners, but they do not suite the character changes. There are plenty of humorous moments, though, as Chucky uses his new brand of humor.
Mark Hamill and Chucky's puppeteers are the true stars carrying the film. An absolutely wonderful, eerie performance from both as Chucky whiplashes between adorable and deranged and back again. Without them, this movie would be blah, average trash.
The weakest link of the film is the child actor playing Andy, who comes across as more wooden than the plastic doll he's friends with and never seems to know what to do with his hands. It's a passable performance made drabbier as it's carried by Chucky's amazing one.
Aubrey Plaza as the mom could be the second weakest, though it is debatable whether her deadpan, unengaging style is meant to emphasize how truly crap and uninvolved a mom she is, or if that's just her as an actress.
The supporting actors are strong and memorable.
All in all, this would be a good date/group movie. Plenty of scares to give you an excuse to scream or snuggle, some funny moments for laughs, and an interesting underlying message you can talk about after.",Child's Play

Look, we get several different iterations of marvel and DC characters all the time...same basic characters but their own unique universe that each story lives in....that's the type of mentality you should have with this movie. It's a fresh take on an old story...some new ideas are introduced to make this movie interesting enough to stand on its own. There are not a ton of kills, but it has enough kills to quench our gore thirst and I felt satisfied by the end of the movie. The death scenes we did get were great- it wasn't just a simple quick stabbing and it's over....you could tell they really put time and effort into making these death scenes special and scenes that you will remember...and I'll take quality over quantity any day. They have just enough humor and cheesiness in this movie to balance out the amount of horror and creepiness...and it just works. I will say it again- Give this movie a chance! It's a very new and up to date take on a classic, and it really is a fun ride...take this for what it is, and have fun with it...try to enjoy this new version, while also knowing and feeling excited about the TV series we are getting with the OG Chucky! I think we child's play fans are getting spoiled! Let's be honest, the last few straight to DVD Chucky movies were pretty awful....this new take is solid, and in my opinion it will only push Mancini to want to make the TV series as great as possible....Chucky is no longer just a joker...he is genuinely scary again! And, really, all I want from the TV series is to see OG Chucky find it's roots and return back to the style and atmosphere of the first two Child's Play movies...OG Chucky was without a doubt at his best in the first two movies...I don't mind some humor, but I want to see the same killer doll that gave me nightmares when I was a kid....NOT the joke cracking wise ass Chucky who is impregnating female dolls and having ugly ass doll children....IM LOOKING AT YOU, SEED OF CHUCKY! Lmao that movie was such a let down...even for a straight to DVD movie...it really had no business being made, along with a few of the others.

It was similar enough in its nature to the original that it still feels like a Chucky film.They build tension over the first 2 acts in the same way that made the original Child's Play spooky. There are some great moments for those who appreciate gratuitous gore.The ""technology gone wrong"" approach instead of the supernatural angle made it feel more like Black Mirror than Poltergeist, and I really enjoyed that aspect of it. It's no masterpiece, but the acting, production, writing, and special effects are leagues above every other horror remake that's come along.",Child's Play

368,bora_mustafa,"A re-imagining done right, I love this movie!!!",10,4 December 2019,"I must admit, I didn't expect much of this new Chucky movie, considering the last three movies (Seed, Curse and Cult) weren't that great at all. However I am happy to say that I love this new updated story of Chucky and it may even surpass the original in some ways. Firstly let me get the elephant out the room, the design of Chucky, I've read many fans absolutely hated the design of Chucky. Personally I think this design fits the new version of the story, there are moments where it appears really cute and adorable and other moments where it just looks damn creepy. I think the design of the doll is fine, remember the rule, a re imagining of a movie must not copy everything.Also I like the fact that this Chucky is AI intelligence rather than a possessed doll. I won't really go into the plot as I'm sure all Chucky fans have already seen this. What I will say is that this new Childs Play movie is great and if you just want a fun, gory slasher you cannot go wrong with this movie.Is it a perfect movie? No, there are some flaws, but to me the biggest flaw is the group of friends Andy hangs out with, I didn't like any of them, they were not useful and to me would have been better if they weren't shoehorned into the film. Secondly the scene with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 film, I found it quite strange that kids of that age would laugh at the carnage on screen, but I understand why this scene is included.I really do think this movie deserves a sequel and hopefully we will get it. Finally which Chucky do I prefer, well the answer to that at this moment is still Brad Dourif's Chucky but I also love Mark Hamill's version. I guess I can't really give a definite answer until we hopefully see more from this reboot.",Child's Play

370,robbiehirst-95168,Laughable!,4,23 October 2019,"I genuinely gave this a chance in the hope that they could recreate it to actually be scary.Wow. How wrong could I be! 😂This film is shockingly bad from start to finish.Throughout the whole film I was seriously trying to find excuses for its downfalls......and it would have got a 4 rating........until the moment of all ridiculous moments.................To save his mum from hanging, little Andy used a chainsaw to try and cut the rope (a very normal rope) for what seemed like a minute or two. (Which is actually a long time with a chainsaw!)
Well. It didn't work and when he was attacked from behind by Mr Chucky himself they both fell fighting and clung to said rope.
Miraculously Andy pulled out a knife and sliced the rope in a split second for it to break.
And to be clear, it was a separate area to the previously attempted hack of an actual chainsaw.I'm sorry but although a knife IS capable of that, the chainsaw would have EASILY cut it in the first place!!
I cannot stand the idea that this was meant to be 'edge of your seat' when common sense proves otherwise.
It was that badly produced at that moment that I actually feel really embarrassed for the director!Would have scored a rating of 2 but I feel sorry for the kids who did the best they could with a shocking script. So a 3 is all I can force.

Hilarious similarity to the Simpsons Tree House of Horrors episode where the Crusty Doll is set to evil on accident and torments Homer. This isn't the Simpsons. Hilarity does not ensue. This movie is only filled with tedious, cringe-worthy movie moments of things that would never happen in the real world. Who would buy Siri or Google Assistant for a 9 year old in the autonomous robot body of the creepiest doll since Annabelle? Who would allow such a doll to have an ""evil"" setting? Why would an all encompassing media company make a creepy doll and hook it up to all it's networks, including self driving cars?

376,cyberjoshy-49579,Decent remake,7,15 January 2020,"I see alot of 1 and 10's for this movie. In my opinion its neither. I liked the movie quite alot. I prefer the AI angle much more than the silly voodoo of the original. It also made it plausible that chucky could control other machines and even makes sense if they make a sequel to this. (chucky being uploaded to the cloud)Some compare this to the terminator but thats unfair imo. The AI never wants to murder Andy, it just wants him for himself. The AI is not evil, it just has no notion of good and evil and acts on what he learns. Without the restrictions that are removed at the start of the movie, his actions make perfect sense, from a machine point of view. ( i even felt sorry for him at some point!)
The acting was fine, iam not expecting or looking for stellar performances in a horror movie.What i didnt like was that alot of the gory stuff was mild. The camera turned away or the scene is very dark. Also it was 2 light hearted and tried to be funny 2 much. It is almost if they tried to make a family friendly horror movie.
I dont understand why Andy didnt involve the police after he found the severed head.
Some personal issue i had with the movie is that it seemed abit woke. Depicting men, especially white men as bad. Evidence: Andy's dad, absend father. First victim the friend that also happened to cheat on his own family, the creepy janitor of the appartment building that is also a peeping tom, The black guy was ofcourse a good guy and a cop. So we are made to feel good when the white guys die, because they deserved it. But we are supposed to feel sad when the black people die since they are nice and good people, this is woke trash writing.
Of the group of kids (minus Andy) only the girl is assertive and acts, while the boys cower in fear.Overall i would recommend this movie just dont expect a masterpiece.",Child's Play
377,Frankaub-1,A good horror movie but...,6,2 July 2019,"I'm must start by saying that I am a huge fan of the child's play frenchise and generally I hate it when they change the story. So I wasn't particulary sold on the idea that Charles lee Ray was remove from the scenario and I didn't like that Brad Dourif was not doing Chucky voise.But after seing the movie I can say that I really enjoy it but I'm kind of confuse. I like the idea of IA going rogue even if it's not original I mean we already have Skynet, HAL 9000, the replican in Blade runner etc. But the movie endle it pretty well. I think it's a really good Idea for a an AI horror movie it just bother's me that they choose Chucky I mean why not change the name of the movie and use a completly different doll?Anyways if we analyse the movie, I think they could have done a little bit better. They should have said that the doll is the most avance IA ever created and that he can learn evolve etc. I Also think they should have chose a tounger actor to play the kid because andy is kind of old to play with a doll.On the good side, Mark Hamill voice is awsome for the scary doll, the kill are good I like the fact that the story is more beleivable than the original. I also like the fact that we have a mix feeling for the doll because he only kill to protect Andy and to be his freind.Finally, I still prefer the original and a lot scince the original child's play is one of my favorite movie of all time, but this one is very good too.

378,CoffinVideo1983,I Wanted to Like it SOOOO Much... But No :(,4,17 September 2019,"Every review I read for this movie spoke of how the movie made an effort to update the original storyline by getting rid of the cursed doll plot for the updated plot of Chucky just being programmed to be evil. Personally, I thought it made for a sloppy storyline with tons of holes and no real way of ever working out a sequel.First of all, just making Chucky a ""smart"" doll with control over other household devices really would have been more than enough of an update in my opinion. And when I say HOUSEHOLD DEVICES... I'm saying that giving him control over autonomous vehicles is just ridiculous. There are plenty of household devices he could have manipulated to assist in some new kills, and if him manipulating a vehicle was that important... I would have just gave him the ability to control where the car's destination was. Perhaps he could have used control over the car to help bring victims to a certain location where he could kill them more easily?!By changing the plot to him just being programmed for evil, we were left with holes like how he gets the name Chucky to begin with. The film just had him randomly decide on the name vs. it having anything to do with the storyline. It also takes away a large element of the storyline of the killer that possesses the doll battling with trying to escape the confines of the doll and return to some form of human body; which, in my opinion, was a great layer to the original storyline.Furthermore... How do you move forward with any kind of sequel when the only doll that was programmed for evil is now dead? At least with it being a possession, you have the ability for the killer to return through different dolls or other items.Other than a poorly written storyline, I thought the kills were rather simple, and honestly.... Lame.The one good thing about the film was that it gave me a new found respect for the original Child's Play for actually making a doll scary. Perhaps I just took that fact for granted, but after seeing a completely unfrightening version of Chucky in this film... I know can see how it could be quite the challenge to do so. Which I thought the original Chucky was more than scary.Horrible screenplay aside... I thought the acting was wonderful, the film was shot well, and the fx of the kills were nice.

They would easily be able to use the dolls to see what was happening in every household the doll was in. The company would also be able to tell that all the safety protocols were disabled on this one unit.12) Don't be mean to your fellow employees.

396,nickijjohnson-16955,Nope. Not Chucky.,4,13 November 2019,This was an okay albiet cheesy horror movie but a TERRIBLE Child's Play movie. He is not Chucky in essence. Charles aka Chucky was a bad man. He possesses a doll and continues to be a bad man. The AI crap is inventive because it gave him more power and allowed him to be everywhere but don't see why they couldn't mix the 2 storylines at least. This version of Chucky was a choir boy compared to the original. Yeah he was bad but he didn't even understand that he was bad like the original character did. That's what makes Chucky so evil. He's human. This version pisses on the original so nope. Not a fan but they tried.,Child's Play

But for me, I could watch it on it's own terms and I enyojed what this movie had to give by making Chucky AI that actually does want to be Andy's friend but it is deeply broken on the inside. It's able to explore some very different things like friendship, jealousy and it takes things in a very different direction.

But then in time as the trailers dropped, some plot details revealed and Mark Hamill was announced as the voice of Chucky. I was intrigued.You have to keep in mind that this is a complete reimagining of Chucky. If you go to watch this movie for the first time expecting and hoping for anything like the original Chucky, you're likely setting yourself up for disappointment. But if you prepare yourself for something completely different, then I'm sure you will enjoy this fresh take on the franchise.I'm very happy to say that for a horror remake (which never normally works out too well) this is an enjoyable movie. It did what it needed to do, and that was a complete reimagining. Sure, it's not as good as the original Child's Play, or Child's Play 2 (my personal favourite) for that matter.

406,oaspag-71318,"Good. If slightly deceiving, but as remake, good.",8,10 July 2019,"Hi there! Just a 2 cents.I saw this tonight and was overall happy, but truthfully, it felt a bit underwhelming for me. But, still, solid. I knew that it would not be the same as the original and this remake even veered away from the original's premise which was that an evil spirit had possessed the doll, that of a serial killer whom 'transfered' his soul in a doll before his death; then, the doll, Chucky, was the serial killer (Brad Dourif) - as a doll. In this new take/remake, Chucky is Buddi and he an artificial AI doll that goes 'haywire'...when a Vietnamese (at the start of the film) decides suicide himself (after his boss fires him) in Vietnam Buddy dolls factory...he removes all the 'safety' protocols of this one Buddi doll...and then the doll is dynsfunctional and turns murderous when it learns of 'killing' and its 'circuits lose it'...The young actor in the film is quite good in acting and helps this film strongly...he's a young boy being raised by his solo mother and they try to make the best of it (she works in a 'Zed Mart' place...that sells Buddy Chucky dolls...); when one dolls becomes defective she decides to ask the manager to 'keep it' for as present to her son.....so then Buddi will end up in their home...and that's when all things fall apart.Buddy/Chucky is very friendly and says - repeatedly to Andy (the lil boy) : ''Are we having fun''...''You are my best friend Andy''. And for Buddi, the doll means it Litterally..in a sense that during the film the boy is scolded by his mother's bad boyfriend and will eventually kill him for : ''Nobody touches my friend Andy''...and then later, a grand-ma next door will suffer same fate, again Buddy: ''You will never be the best friend of Andy...I am'', because the grand-ma says :'' you're my new best friend...'' to Andy...but Buddy takes Slight to that.The boyfriend, the grand-ma neigbor and house cat are killed viciously by the dolll which exacts vengeance for anyone saying something bad or hurting Andy...at a certain point Andy starts to understand that the doll is completely wack and insane, the A.I. in it does not understand that Andy does not want the doll to hurt/kill anybody...but Buddi...just doesn't understand : ''I thought we were having fun ... and they hurt you. I'm your friend, forever''. So Andy is losing it because he can't do anything with this creepy robotic doll, he's stuck with it and then after it kills on its own at night - and Andy understands the predicament Buddi puts him in, he now becomes a suspect because nobody would believe him that a murderous 'doll toy killed all these people'; so, he would be suspected of being the killer (insteay of the doll). So he hides it all and with his friends...they had enough and want to terminate Buddi; Buddi is killed and Andy throws him the dump...but, by chance (or unchance) the building cleaning man looking at the garbage sees Buddi's carcass..and wants to keep the doll, and revive it - so he does. And then Buddi, is alive again, and he immediately kills this man - and wants to go back to Andy (because for Buddi, Andy is his only friend - always, even after death/attacked by Andy). But, this time, he's angry (his eyes turned 'red' when angry...otherwise he has deep blue eyes and looks unsuspicious/doll-like), you can tell he is in 'kill mode' when his eyes change..he goes to Andy (Andy suspectes that Buddi came back in a 'clone' doll..another Buddi that is messed up (another robot doll that is wack), but he realizes that it is exactly the doll he put down that is back. And Buddi says: '' Andy...why did you hurt me...we are best friends... you hurt me... you broke me ... I will open you to verify of what you are made up inside - to see if you have a heart. Andy don't run, I am coming''..obviously, Buddi means that literally, he intends to kill Andy/or hurt him badly for killing him. He abducts his mother and uses her a a bait to catch/make Andy come when Andy finds out his mother was trapped in the mall (there was an unvelieving of the new Buddi 2 in the Zed Mart with tons of people/kids wanting the new toy...in that moment, Buddi jams the store everyone is killed by Buddi, he uses 'drones' with chopping blades that kamikaze on people. Except, his friends whom escape intact of the mall and he decides to stay in it - because he sees mother captured by Buddi...so it's him alone vs Buddi to save him mother.The film did a great job of capturing the doll-like 'innocence' of the doll...you feel that this toy 'seems' a nice toy/doll...but very early you get a feeling that is a creepy doll that probably will turn bad. The film itself is more closer to a 13 or 16 rating in terms of audience age...I was surprised...overall...there is not that much gore/blood in this film...I think they did that to obtain a lower rating for more public audience/have young people see the movie too. But, yes, there is blood/gore by times, pretty gruesome, but most is quick and fast; so, the camera is not showing much - unlike the original version far more blood/gory. This film was not scary per say...but by times yes, mostly creepy...because it's a doll...and the doll itself is the symbolism/representation of 'child'...the doll is the size of a child. Chucky/Buddi was voiced by an old person in the original, here too, but the freakishly scary Chucky...is much less so now. Chucky in Child's Play original was far more 'evil' and deadly like. Now, he,s more like a sick robot doll. it's not to say he's not scary...but...a robot is less scary...than a possessed voodoo doll/with a spirit of serial killer vs an electronic robot that pops a couple of wires/transistor and goes hay-wire. What is interesting and more relatable, is that the film is more realistic per say..than the original...it could be possible that an evil AI robot doll...do this if it learns to kill. It's not science-fiction anymore. While, in the original movie, it's a paranormal (voodoo) sci-fi spirit possession horror. So, in that sense, the movie is far scarier for that...imagine getting a 20 inch tall doll that seems friendly and all, and is all electronic/A.I controlled...what says that A.I. (with deep neural thinking) could not learn something 'bad'...and someone could actually make a doll - do bad - on purpose (just like the early in film suicidal Vietnamese factory worker 'programmed' the defective doll to kill humans...), it's not a far fetch scenario as we enter the robotization/automatization and A.I..today...it's coming, robots will come more and more, and A.I. is the next revolution in all the industries (even beating the computer itself). because it can learn, like a child...or like a child doll...with an evil A.I...like Buddi.I wanted it to be better, of course, but, overall, I had a good time and it does the job - it is not as good at the original...I would say it compares to Child Play 2/3...sort of...in terms of quality/effort. But, for a remake, they remade it (and it's always very hard to 'beat the original'..if impossible, so the remake is well-done); and even added their own twist to story/Chucky doll by updating it to the times of today (A.I. robots), so that's a plus. The original was more 'evil-like' freaky scary 'demonic possessed doll' horror like, this one is more evil-robot- doll like. I give a generous 8.",Child's Play

Very different take from the original.I liked the first 20-30 min of this movie. And I agreed with the killing of the loser mom's cheating boyfriend.Then..the kid got annoying. And dumb AF choices. Even unlikeable. His acting sucked once the killings began.Killing the detective's mom was unnecessary. Senseless. The cat? Too much. The detective. Horrible. Senselessly killing likeable characters doesn't help build rapport with the audience.Then this crap turned into gratuitous gore for the sake of voluminous bloodshed.Chucky wasn't interesting, not like in the first movie. Brad Dourif's Chucky was HILARIOUS AF. Had so much charm. Dourif breathed some juicy life into that Chucky. And the original Chucky was driven by a solid motive for his bloodshed. This remake's Chucky was pretty much a clingy codependent stalker.I lost all investment in this movie after the Kaslan car bloodshed in the parking lot. Didn't care what happened to Andy.

412,nicetryjan,Better than the last couple Mancini films.,8,22 June 2019,"This is a solid movie. It is entertaining, and it keeps you gripped throughout. I actually wish it was a bit longer than 90 minutes.Mancini and the rest of the original crew can hate on this film all they want, but I actually thought it was a lot better than the last couple of movies that Don released. Let's face it, after Child's Play 3, it got comedic and kind of stupid. Curse and Cult had terrible CGI, and let's not forget they were both straight to DVD. While I don't think this reboot is scary, I think it's the best Chucky movie since Child's Play 2. For one, it's more believable. A smart toy malfunctioning is a lot more plausible than a serial killer transferring his soul into a doll.With this Chucky, he really isn't aware that what he is doing is wrong. He strangles and eventually kills the pet cat, but he believes that doing that will make his best buddy, Andy, happy. In one scene he actually apologizes to Andy for misbehaving, and in another he pleads with him not to be locked in the closet. (I'm a huge cat lover, so of course after seeing he killed their cat I wanted him gone). Of course, once bad things start happening, Andy and his friends decide to destroy the doll. Unfortunately, it ends up in the hands of a stalker who is obsessed with Karen, who repairs it. Chucky kills him, and then poses as another Buddi doll to try and get to Andy. Andy warns his mother, who of course doesn't believe his accusations. The last twenty minutes take place at Zed Mart, where Andy's mother works. They introduce the new Buddi 2. All hell breaks loose, and Andy has to save his mother etc etc.Overall, I enjoyed it. I do think Aubrey Plaza looked a little young to have a 13 year old son, and I wish we would have seen Chucky actually tying Karen up to the machine. But other than that, it was great. If they make a sequel, and I hope they do, I hope they call it Buddi 2.",Child's Play

8.5/10 🔪🚘👨‍🔧🎁. ""Child's Play is a short, but sweet (and gory) call back to 80s slasher movies, never trying too hard like it's original.""
.
.Everyone doubted the remake that made our favorite little slasher look different. But one should learn by now that looks aren't everything. Child's Play is a fun and entertaining horror movie that blends the elements of horror and a little bit of comedy very well together. The characters were likeable for the most part, even the most annoying ones because let's face it, they were ""corrected"" later on. The story is quite simple; the whole typical evil engineer fiddles with something he isn't supposed to and creates an evil incarnation. And as far as the new Chucky goes, it's excellent. The look is a very unsettling one however setting the bar for seemingly harmless yet so deadly, unbeknownst to the wrong doings it commits. Mark Hamill is a very good fit for the voice of Chucky who knows how to work an audience with his intimidating shifts in tone. I felt that the biggest stronghold here was the gore effect in the kills that racked up the count and is definitely a plus in my book.

Before I talk about the Pro's I want to mention a few odd feelings I got from this film. Firstly, this film actually made me feel bad for Chucky, at least for half of the movie, I don't know if that was the intent but it was a strange feeling and it took away from the villainous aspect of Chucky. Secondly I was expecting a scarier film, your more scared of Chucky's intentions rather than Chucky himself, but the tension is decent. Thirdly, unfortunately Mark's Hamill's voice didn't suit Chucky in my opinion, at least not for fear factor, instead it added to the sympathy factor as the kids in this movie pretty much corrupt him. If your a hardcore fan you'll probably dislike this film, but I enjoyed it apart from one or two scenes. I didn't like Chucky's look in this film, but I got over it given time.",Child's Play

422,GoreWhoreAust,Unfortunately this is not terrible.,6,22 June 2019,"I was really hoping, for Don Mancini's sake, that this 'remake' would be terrible and that audiences would quickly forget that it even existed, much like what happened with the Elm St remake of 2010.In all honesty, I can't say that this is a bad movie, it's certainly not great but no one would be expecting that. It is however a satisfactory little bit of entertainment, a mild horror romp with a reasonable level of gore to keep it in the genre and quite a bit of humour that is admirably dark most of the time.I'm very much a fan of the original and the following films, even the lesser instalments have their charms, so I was appalled when it was announced that MGM / Orion were going to exploit original creator Don Mancini's IP via a rights loop hole.Though the final result in not the train-wreck I'd hoped for, it proves itself to be a shameless exploit of the original as this remake hardly bares any resemblance to the 1988 film aside from the title, character names and the look of Chucky.This film could have easily existed on its own merits with no connection to the Child's Play franchise - and that's its biggest crime.There is nothing worse than watching a remake that is just a pale comparison of the original, adding nothing new, so begrudgingly I would have to admit that Child's Play 2019 does do a great deal differently, for better or worse.While this Chucky lacks the menace and personality of the original, he's a different character, one who you sympathise with rather than fear for a great deal of the film. Even when he goes completely psycho in the final act, I felt he had reasonable motives however flawed - he had been wronged and he was angry.Like so many recent major studio horror movies (I'm looking at you The Conjuring universe) there is nothing scary in Child's Play 2019, it does better as a lowbrow satire and even lower brow Asimov knock off. The shooting style isn't very cinematic - the original was gritty and textured - this film is too clean and it just does't have the sense of threatening evil that made the original a genuine horror movie. Reason being is that this time round Chucky really isn't evil at all.Also the doll effects are not great, particularly Chucky's face which apparently is a combination of practical and CG. The most recent film in the original series ,Cult Of Chucky, had a far smaller budget but in my opinion delivered superior doll effects than what we get here and certainly not a patch on what was achieved over 30 years ago in the original - those effects well and truly hold up today.On one last positive note, Bear McCreary provides another fun, effective score - its been a busy year for him.Who knows if sequels will follow? I hope to see more from Don Mancini and the original storyline. Maybe the two can co-exist? I'm sure Mancini won't be able to resist some reference to the corruption of his series in whatever he is cooking up next.",Child's Play

For anyone like me who's been a member of the Cult Of Chucky since they were a small child, CLEAR YOUR MIND of everything you know about him from here on out. This is NOT the voodoo possessed Good Guy Doll that we've fallen in love with for the last three decades. As all of the trailers and interviews suggest, this is an evil electronic ""smart doll"" that kills people. I know that this film is getting TONS of hate, and some things I agree with critics on, while other nit picks I think are just ridiculous. I view this film with the same lens as I view Halloween (2018). I view it as a well done piece of concept art that doesn't retcon the original or its sequels. As flawed as these reboots are, I'm just glad to see my horror idols on the silver screen again. Last year was Michael's first time since 2002 (That Rob Zombie trailer-trash torture porn doesn't count). And although Chucky has had incredible direct-to-video releases (2013's Curse Of Chucky and 2017's Cult Of Chucky) this was his first outing on the silver screen since 2004's Seed Of Chucky. And as flawed as these movies might be at times, I'm just so starved of seeing my idols on the big screen in the last decade that virtually ANYTHING is welcome at this point. I just want the characters to carry on. I think we've all had our full of the Paranormal craze that has completely dominated the horror genre for the last decade! We want our movie monsters BACK! Look, all I'm saying is: did the film have plot holes? YES! Is a voodoo curse scarier than a malfunctioning computer doll any day of the week? HELL YES! Am I going to continue to follow the original series that's still in production? HELL TO THE YES! But at the same time this movie had some really good moments and I think that Gabriel Bateman did an exceptional job as Andy and has a really bright future ahead of him. I mean the kids got KILLER chops for basically a baby in this business! Can it touch the original or most of its sequels? HEEEEELL NO! But it was good for what it was people, so let's just embrace it into the franchise, but continue to be loyal to Don Mancini, David Kirschner, Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly; while respecting the ambition of this reimagining in the process! 🔪🔪🔪🔪",Child's Play

Casting is terrible, acting is dire, the script is laughable and idiotic, the plot (very different to the original and far superior film) is so stupid and badly executed.

429,reddice26,Still better than IT,6,1 February 2020,"A lot of the hate comes from people who enjoyed the terrible remake of IT. Ironic though, seeing as that movie was no horror at all and was basically 1 big "" yo momma"" joke. So don't take the negative reviews too serious.This remake of Child's Play has its flaws and is in all ways inferior to the original. However, it's placed in a modern setting with some very painful and gore filled deaths and making it a much more mature version. The doll itself is threatening enough, seeing as it is an AI and is thus not limited to its body as in the original film. The new characters are ok, but don't add much value, because they are not fleshed out enough. Something tells me the original screenplay was intended to be about 30 minutes longer.The humour is this movie is better than in the previous Chucky movies and fits in well with the story.I watched it with no expectations and enjoyed it. I would say, give it a try!",Child's Play

And I really mean NPCs right down to their main characteristics laid out plainly. Like the cliche NPCs start stacking up quick, mean step-dad, nice old lady, bratty kid/bully, helpful fat boy and capable girl duo.Audrey Plaza really helped me get through this one and Brian Henry is pretty well cast. Mark Hamill never really got to go all out voice wise and there were times when he could have been let loose like the OG Chucky.",Child's Play

Unfortunately creepy was the gear that it stayed in, and never threatened to move into more chilling territory. The kills were as gaudy and over the top as you would expect from this franchise. It's up to you if you find them creatively entertaining or tacky and lame.

It's no longer paranormal, it's a glitched out android connected to the internet and so it's AI turns pretty psycho.The new design of the doll is terrible, and it's distracting to me that you can hear servos when it moves as if it were some kind of mini-robocop or terminator..I'm honestly shocked this has above a 6 rating as of the time I write this..Yes it has humor but the humor seems hamfisted.. it was never scary or creepy to me, I'd love to see the original series chucky square off against this thing..

Chucky looks like play dough and he isn't Charles Lee Ray either, it was just a bad AI chip which made him evil. He only killed to help Andy because he wanted to be Andy's best friend whereas in the original he killed because he was a serial killer. E.g. when Andy got annoyed at the cat, Chucky killed the cat because he didn't want Andy to be annoyed.

I didn't like it so my expectations for the movie were really low.I also really didn't like how the doll looked. It was too creepy to begin with. (Not to say that the original chucky was any cuter, but still...) I think it would have been better to give it a more amiable look and then give it the creepier look when it goes berzerk.But once the killing begins you forget about how it looked and boy are there good killings.Most of the acting is passable at best, but Mark Hamill is excelent. The guy knows his voice acting business and it shows.The kid is also good, but the rest of the cast... lets say its not memorable.But this is a slasher and it that regard, it delivers.

And here I come to my second point: imho (to be honest) this reboot is just such a good movie! It is actually one of the better ones out of the whole franchise!

This new take is kind of a homage with a fresh take concerning technology that kind of reminds me of a Black Mirror episode, but without the slightest intention of taking itself seriously.Don't expect a compelling atmosphere, plot, or any decent jump scares.

It was funny, had a great story line, enjoyable characters AND gave a modern twist to Chucky. I wouldn't change a thing, I was entertained from start to finish.

Mark Hamill is great as everyone expected. They also do a good job of building tension and making you feel a bit of fear. There is a problem with the doll however. It is a real doll for most of the movie, however they switched it to cgi at some points.

450,fandomly,"Tired of fake ""9 & 10"" reviews for bad movies.",1,29 June 2019,"This movie is 100% garbage.I was willing to watch it even though the doll looked terrible and the trailer was so-so. I knew not to expect ""Chucky"" but more of an AI gone wrong. I also had seen plenty of negative reviews, so my standards were pretty low.I thought that guaranteed at least somewhat of a good time. When you expect nothing you can't be disappointed, right? Wrong.The movie is everything I hate about bad horror movies:1. Gore replaces originality. You get over the top scenes of gore that are so tonally off with the rest of the movie.2. Dialogue was written by a toddler. It's so generic and amateurish even for a kid's movie it would insult the kid's intelligence. That's how low it is.3. Character act unrealistically. They find dead bodies and just move on like nothing happened. No real reaction. No trauma. No long term effects.4. Another movie that needlessly adds a ""cast of kids"" to ride the wave of Stranger Things. Only these kids are generic, flat, and have zero story or any kind of objective want/need to drive their stories. They are just tools. Boring ones.5. Chucky is a mess. He sounds ridiculous. He's not funny. He's not cute. He's certainly not threatening.6. Humor is bad. Oh, plenty of laughs, but mostly at how absurd and ridiculous it was. The actual jokes rarely landed.7. The storyline is just bad. It's a paint-by-numbers story that is still off. I'm used to barely there plotlines as a horror lover. But when it's barely there, and still patchy, I can't stand it. How do you ruin ""generic"". It's generic for a reason.8. Chucky has no personality. None whatsoever. He just repeats and mimics and then randomly kills to be Andy's friend.9. Andy and Chucky share very few scenes prior to the killing, yet andy act very emotional when chucky needs to be put down. It was just so emotionally unrealistic. He seemed more disturbed by shutting down a doll he had for 2 seconds than finding the ripped off face of a human being.I don't mind bad horror movies. I do mind stupid ones that don't make sense. That are generic, and still inconsistent, and pointless.I can't think of a single positive thing about this movie. Even the acting as very basic, and not at all good.",Child's Play

453,wilhelm-22,"Decent satire, disappointing horror",5,22 July 2021,"I went into this expecting an embarrassing failure. The original ""Child's Play"" is one of the most iconic horror films ever made, so how could a new version possibly live up to the expectations?Initially I was pleasantly surprised. The film makers made the wise decision to totallyrethink the plot. In this version, Chucky is an AI robot gone rouge, rather than a doll possessed by a serial killer. This is a brilliant setup that places the film firmly in 2021, and makes it work as an interesting satire of our modern information society and its possible threats.We are also presented to relatable characters, the teen Andy and his worried mother. Andy is a ""special"" and lonely kid, therefore susceptible to the promise of Chucky's eternal friendship. Chucky's only job is to be a good friend to the boy, but his very literal interpretations of what Andy says leads him to murder. One cool dramatic device is that Chucky records everything he hears and sees. From time to time he replays the snippets of information that has inspired his grizzly acts. This way the audience is reminded that Chucky is only a product of the information he has been subjected to.So, the underlying idea is a very good one. However, the movie fails miserably in the horror department. The new Chucky isn't half as terrifying as the original one, and the scary scenes are highly clichéd and uninspired. The victims are the stereotypical ones, and the kid heroes are ridiculously resourceful. What's worse, once the film makers turn their attention towards horror, they seem to forget all the good things that they had in the setup. For instance, Andy's ""special kid"" status is forgotten very quickly. Also, we loose track of Chucky's motivation as he turns from misguided but well-meant deeds, to full-on mass murder.I give it a 5. Some really interesting and fresh ideas, but the film runs out of steem pretty fast and starts relying on tired cliches.",Child's Play
454,frobrojkt,"Good retelling, but not without its flaws.",6,26 June 2019,"I never found the premise of the original Child's Play all that intriguing, but after seeing the previews and how they were going to modernize the original plot I was a little more optimistic.This is not so much a ""remake"" as it is a ""retelling"", a ""reimagining"" if you will. The additions added to the plot to modernize Chucky were honestly the best part of the movie. Chucky is transformed from a possessed 80's animatronic doll, to a creepy 80's doll imbedded with an evil Amazon Alexa. I personally felt this update to the plot was amazing in theory. Kinda like a Black Mirror update to the classic 80's horror film. However, unfortunately the intrigue of the plot gets lost amid poor acting and predictability. I wish they would've pushed deeper into the Black Mirror esq additions to the story. I feel like there was so much untapped potential in that vein.This is not a bad film, but it's not really a good one either. It has a few really good moments, followed by a few bad ones. Given a choice between this version and the original, I would honestly pick this one (probably a controversial opinion). Child's Play 2019 was fun, but just nothing really special.",Child's Play

456,ScreenRanker,7.5/10⭐ - Makes Thrillers Look Like Child's Play!,7,21 June 2019,"I have noticed a something about Chucky fans and good reviews - they cannot coexist!!! They all say that this has no meaning to the original franchise and thus reject it as irrelevant. THIS IS NOT A CONTINUATION OF THE ORIGINAL!!! It's barely a reboot. A very different story.It's dark. And gory. And creepy. Intense, at times. The first scene before the title had me thinking this was a thriller. With that in mind, the movie delivered.This story has a lot to teach us, and while critics are saying that this movie tells us about the dangers of AI (they are probably right, in regards to the angle of the film), I see it as a window into our own dark nature. Everything that Chucky did reflected what he learnt from humans. He sees Andy enjoying seeing someone's face come off during a chainsaw horror movie, and then shows hatred towards someone who is disrupting his relationship with Chucky, so what does Chucky do? Exactly what he has learnt.
You might say that Chucky himself was a victim here. Victim to a species of creatures (us) whose world doesn't make much sense. He was taught things that were destructive even though we experience them in our everyday lives - raw human emotions. In a world where we humans haven't even sorted ourselves out yet, we are 'forced' to give AI safety settings, because if they ever understood the world we live in, they might just find themselves in constant survival mode. All it took was a 'mistake' in the programming of a little toy doll to reveal how harmful the world can be on an innocent mind who simply wanted to learn.I could ponder on several other themes from this movie, but to summarise the movie itself, it was good. Pretty gory and creepy, no doubt. After all, it is from the producers of 'It'. Though sadly it doesn't have the same flawless CGI as 'It'.
Regardless, it was pretty darn good and I was surprised that it was only 90 minutes; it felt longer, even though I was enjoying it so much. Music was brilliant, as was Hamill. I'll definately be buying this one on DVD!",Child's Play

In terms of the story there is a lot of difference to the other Childs Play/Chucky movies and this a refreshing treat.
The doll design, which at first glance seems like an abomination (aesthetically speaking) actually works well and although there is some weirdness with it, it pulls off being both amusing and creepy when it should be. There are some moments where the effects are a little odd, especially with CGI, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.

Sure I enjoyed Chucky and Brad Dourif for the voice, but with this latest remake the writers brought a different take to it which with the AI portion and it was nice to see Chucky in this can control anything so makes it much more effective and quite scary for modern future of AI robots. This remake actually makes you feel for the Chucky robot doll. I was very skeptical before going into watching this, but like many others, was shocked and surprised. Sure the characters could have been written better and some suspense added to the formula, but it's a horror flick. I noticed some reviews people said this was a weak comedy horror, umm what you think the rest of the child's play sequels were? Bride of Chucky? They were all comedy base horror.

464,epa101,An original take on the story,7,22 June 2019,"I've just seen the film in Leeds. I found the first half-hour very intriguing. The story of how Chucky becomes evil is almost believable. The voodoo in the first film was not my favourite part and the part about possessing the body of a six-year-old boy would probably not be allowed these days.Instead, a man in a brutal sweatshop in Vietnam is told to finish the doll that he is working on and then he is sacked. He decides to take revenge and removes all safeguards from the doll. I can almost believe that this would happen, although it's odd how he was working in a sweatshop when he knew about computer coding.The relationship between Karen and Andy Bradley continued the theme of a struggling single mum from the original, but Andy is older. She buys him the toy to cheer him up and he's initially not interested. Chucky is defective and calls him ""Andy sup"" at first, but then he learns by observing. The first half of the film actually makes an effort to explain how Chucky becomes violent (he learns by watching) but this gets ignored in the second half. Chucky somehow becomes an evil genius very quickly.It takes a while for the killings to start, but there is a lot of blood once it gets going. There seemed to be some influence from the ""Saw"" films with the more creative and sadistic killings. The end of the film is very intense. Intentionally or not, there is a moment at the end that is similar to the end of ""The Babadook"".Although I enjoyed the film overall, I had some reservations. The main Black child character (Omar) felt like a very crude stereotype to me, and there was also a ""big momma"" Black character. All the kids in the film wear hoodies in virtually every scene. I liked the strong girl (Falyn) who was needed given that Karen somehow gets bound and gagged by a doll.",Child's Play

This is one of those few films where the more I watch it, the more details I notice. You actually feel bad for Chucky in this movie because even though he killed many people, all he wanted to do was to make sure he was by his owner, Andy's side. He's just a piece of AI, so he doesn't know any better and it adds a more emotional core to this movie. One thing this version also does better is Andy himself. While I did like him in the first three movies (I have yet to see Curse of Chucky or Cult of Chucky), I feel like this version gives him more character and, like Chucky, you sympathise with him when he has to kill his former friend because of how they've bonded together.I must say that making Chucky a robotic AI toy instead of a possessed doll was also really clever. It helps this version feel more fresh and doesn't make the film just be a by-the-numbers retelling of the original. I like when remakes or reboots make GOOD changes, and this film benefits from the new Buddi update.It also has an engaging story, great suspense, brilliant acting and really good effects (sure, Chucky looks and moves in a more stiff manner, but I think it works really well with him being a toy robot). Overall, I love this movie a lot, and I could do an entire review explaining why it works so well, and I will on YouTube in the future.And dammit, I need that sequel!",Child's Play

470,rockingdylan,Beyond expectations!,9,22 June 2019,"First of all, I was skeptical that this was going to be a campy, stupid little remake. I was wrong. Throughout the movie, I was arguing with myself on wether this may be the greatest movie in the series. I get it. This movie has the storyline of the first movie, the humour of the 2nd and 3rd movies, the cinematic style of the last 2 movies and the modern day problems of technology controlling us.Mark Hamill as Chucky was excellent. The comedy was well written & well acted and the seriousness was sublime.I think this movie would've done well as a child's movie if the horror elements were taken out. It was a movie beyond my expectations and I would love to see a sequel to this horror (or a PG movie without the horror as a separate series).",Child's Play
471,that_movieguyxx,"You can't just throw Aubrey Plaza and Mark Hamill at us, and call it a day",6,21 June 2019,"As much respect as I have for the original franchise, I can't be as subjectively generous as I might like to be. Seeing Mark Hamill back in action was quite pleasing. Growing up, I don't think any of us saw Luke Skywalker becoming Chucky. At the same time, the gorgeous Aubrey Plaza was very pleasing to the eye. Having said that, as far as the plot goes, they could've done way better. Like the original, I was expecting Chucky to be a possessed doll, housing the soul of a blood thirsty serial killer, but instead they decided to take it entirely off the rails in a new direction, and make him fully A.I.
The movie was sort of cutsie at first. A few jokes here and there, until Chucky basically sees a horror movie, and gets jealous of anyone who tries to separate him and Andy. So he essentially got his killer instinct from watching a movie..
All in all I enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but as it progressed, I was sort of building an expectation for the plot to become a bit more clever, but then the movie just pretty much ended. It was quite short. 6/10 all in all. It wasn't horrible, but it didn't blow anyone's hair back either. Good casting choice, but as far as plot goes, they could've done a little better putting pen to paper.",Child's Play

Not really suspenseful or frightening. Cliche after cliche after cliche. The main kid is okay but the other kids seem like they're the producers kids or something.

The 80s were just a raw time that we can finally see. You really do need a couple of decades to see something. AI was an effect at the time, not a whole movie, so you really had to kill a guy to get the good shot. I'm not sure how many extras were killed in the original but it is worth noting. In the 2019, I am certain no one died during filming - also worth noting else I would not have mentioned it.It's not the 80s anymore yet there are still shocking elements here that will have you screaming, yet... it's not an amazing roller coaster like El Toro at Six Flags. Here, you are generally waiting for the next freak moment and not an advance in the storyline. This storyline for the viewer is basically not who is next but how next will get hit. It doesn't exactly matter, though, because it gets the job done.Aubrey Plaza is uncomfortably attractive. The boy has innocence and edge.

This movie has something about it that is just really really weird. I felt a vibe almost like an episode of Goosebumps from this movie more than anything... a Goosebumps episode that over gory And cruel. If you want a movie that resembles ANYTHING like the original Childs Play movies you will be sorely disappointed. If you can get past that what you will get is a serviceable modern tale of AI gone wrong. Its stupid, gory, and like I said, pretty strange.

I like this new interpretation of him, but I still miss how the original one was done. It just had way more character.The side characters were alright. My favorite one was the detective but I can't remember his name. And those two kids Andy hangs out with weren't really the best. And Andy's moms boyfriend was the biggest jerk in this movie which made his death way more satisfying.The movie does end in a confusing way but I'm fine with it.

Yes, it still can be scary as *!$@# sometimes, but this still doesn't take away the fun feel of this version.I also would like to point out that the acting (Aubrey Plaza was SO MUCH BETTER than Catherine Hicks) and the voice of Mark Hamil as Chucky are both 100% great.I think this deserves a much higher rating and it shouldn't be missed by horror lovers",Child's Play

There are a few bad Chucky films and this one tops them all.They have steered away from the original plot and started a new one with chip technology being reprogrammed badly to cause chucky to be a killer doll. Now Chucky looks absolutely awful with his new look, it looks cheap and nasty and not in the least bit threatening, he comes across as a clingy boyfriend or something and the whinny voice he has now is enough to want to burn it the minute he opens his mouth.The whole plot line has gone off the rails here, the killings and lets just say there isn't many are censored and you see the after effect not the actual kills, the gore is tame and the Doll looks so obviously fake and yes its a doll but at least make it look real enough, it was as menacing as a tin of beans.All the high reviews are just plain bonkers, this is a tame letdown in so many ways, Mark Hamill voices Chucky but hes no Brad Dourif and the Chucky isn't no real Chucky that we know to love, the original is safe for now definitely with this turkey.

Like a long black mirror episode but with Aubrey Plaza.What was actually frightening about the original chucky was that chucky had a horrible human soul inside him. This new version is just an A. I. that was allowed to deviate from his original purpose and embraced violence. It wasn't suspenseful and pretty predictable obviously. The gore scenes where basic and unoriginal, nothing we haven't seen before.Funny fact, my husband and I were carded when entering to see this movie. We were so hyped and shocked they for some reason asked to see IDs. Joke was on us tho, we were literally surrounded by children. For some reason trash ass parents think it's a great idea to bring children to a rated R movie. But the movie was such a joke that the kids enjoyed it, non cried out once, some even sang along to Buddies creepy song.

499,DylanMurphy97,A brilliant re-imagining of the 80's classic,8,22 February 2020,I was very apprehensive about going to see this film as a huge fan of the original 3 Child's Play films. In fairness to this remake it really stayed clear of rehashing the original which wasn't going to be bettered and instead went for a very fresh and different approach to the ''evil doll' brought home story. This film did a fantastic job of utilizing modern day smart technology to be the catalyst for the story and thus setting it apart from the 80's classic by making it a very different film. The execution is fantastic and surprisingly dark and gory for a horror movie in 2019 with so much toning down of horror and gore in the cinema like with IT 2017. Some very gruesome death scenes. Highly recommended a great reboot with some actual thought put into it instead of just another cash cow. 8/10.,Child's Play

I believe the biggest things that made this movie so enjoyable was that they modernized it, did not keep solely to the original script, and lots of killings that was believable and in Chucky's realm of killing. The creepy factor was amplified which made this movie even better. I gave it a 9 because it's not better than the original but really enjoyed it and was very creepy.",Child's Play

The theatre was empty, but for me and my friend - nobody wanted to see the movie? And yet, I tried to stay positive, as I tend to like things notoriously hated by the mainstream. Unfortunately, after an hour I stopped expecting anything less than a comedy - I recommend watching Child's Play with company, preferably after one or two drinks. It comes off as satire, a dumb but funny take on the original, with a sprinkle of gore and black humour. It doesn't fully work but that's two stars for a good start.In addition, I do not have any complaints about the quality of acting, it's completely fine, and the movie is well made - that's another star from me.What about the fourth star?

A doll being possessed by a serial killer due to a magical spell is 1000 times more believable!Didn't have a problem with the actors but the movie itself was boring, unfunny and unoriginal. Why not just come up with a new original story instead of rehashing the same thing. For example the creepy apartment repair guy spying on everyone how unoriginal, the nasty moms bf who the kid hates, death scenes were also really unimaginative.

It's a ridiculous premise and the filmmakers clearly knew this but they still seemed to try and have fun with the dialogue and death scenes.The big issue with this film though is that they removed the supernatural/voodoo elements and instead opted to make the new Chucky a glitched, killer robot doll (not a spoiler - it is literally the opening scene). Because of this the character loses all its charm, appeal and personality and it might as well have been a different franchise. This leaves it down to the poorly cast actors & actresses to pick up the slack.You can't expect much from a film about a killer doll to begin with so Im not going score it too harshly but I would recommend sticking with the first couple of original Childs Play films for your fix of murderous toys.",Child's Play

518,cdmitchell-13772,Decent horror interrupted by humor that never quite lands,6,17 June 2020,"Let me start off by saying that Mark Hamill is quite good as Chucky and the new take on the character is refreshing. This however leads into one of two big problems with the film.The first problem is that the movie is called ""Child's Play"". This is a very big problem because the film is different enough from the 1988 original that the creators clearly could have changed some names and minor plot details and had the movie stand on its own merits. Seeing how they didn't do that, the movie suffers quite a bit from the problem of being too different from the original to be considered a remake and too similar to be viewed as an individual movie.The largest problem with this movie is the humor. The film features a LOT of jokes and attempts at dark humor but the problem with this is that it distracts too much from the horror which means nothing ends up being scary. Every scene that attempts to scare the audience is capped off with some one liner or visual gag that ruins the atmosphere. The biggest offenders in this case is Andy's friends. The way the actors portray them is incredibly cartoonish and unrealistic and ends up taking me out of the scene whenever they are around.Other than these two (albeit large) issues, the film is quite entertaining. The villain is good enough and the dynamic between Andy and Karen is quite sweet. Another thing that stood out was the fantastic score which enhanced the mood whenever it was heard.Overall, ""Child's Play"" (2019) is an entertaining summer blockbuster that has some intense and scary scenes and a very good villain but unfortunately suffers from an overabundance of humor that never quite seems to land and two characters that distract from the film every time they enter a scene.",Child's Play

I know I'll be hated for saying this, but I enjoyed it just as much as the original. I usually tend to criticize the modernization of the horror genre, but I thought the opposite with this one. I thought Chucky being an animatronic who could connect to devices like lights, security cameras, temperature systems, drones, and even cars was a great addition and made for some great deaths.

I had mixed feelings about them re-doing it, Chucky was always one of my favorite horror films, and the character was hilarious. Since I LOVE Mark Hamill, Aubrey Plaza, and Brian Tyree Henry, I figured this new one was at least worth giving a watch, and I have to admit, I really enjoyed it. I still like the original Chucky more (his quips and one-liners are hilarious), but like how they've modernized it, as well as made it slightly more realistic (I will never look at my Alexa/Google Home the same again...).

532,DarrylBrian,A new take on an old classic. Does it work?,7,3 July 2019,"In the original movies the doll is evil because a serial killer transfers his soul into it. He got shot by a police officer so before he died he transferred his soul into the doll via voodoo magic simply because it was the closest thing to him as he was dying. Because of that, the doll has two characters - one being the voice box that's inside and the other is the soul of the serial killer. Toy Story is also similar to some degree. Woody and buzz lightyear both have a voice through a sound box that initiates via a pullstring or a button - ""there's a snake in my boot"" - ""to infinity and beyond"". But they also have a free will voice. And the free will personality is conscience of but seperate from the soundbox and they are even observant of the soundbox and are not aware of what it will say next. That's similar to how the original Chucky doll is too - two personalities. I think it's pretty bold that they made the decision to change his origin. It's risky since there is a huge fanbase. In this new reboot the doll has artificial intelligence - kind of like a Siri, Alexa, or Hey Google built inside of it and, as the movie progresses, it just ""learns"" to be evil. There's no second personality that is already evil. It's just the ""soundbox"" this time around albiet a much more advanced one. So this doll is programmed to be the owner's best friend. That's it's only mission in life. Like how the Terminator is programmed to kill Sarah or John Connor. It stops at nothing and cannot rest until it's mission is complete. It doesn't sleep or eat or take breaks. It just keeps coming. It's relentless. Same with this doll. It only wants to be Andy's best friend which means it will do whatever it thinks will make Andy happy. So to see the doll ""learn"" was pretty interesting. In one scene Andy and his friends are watching an old-school campy yet graphic horror movie - Texas Chainsaw Massacre. They're having a blast eating popcorn and laughing everytime someone dies in a gruesome way. Chucky watches Andy and his friends having a great time watching this movie. It ""learns"" that Andy enjoys this kind of stuff. Then in another scene, Andy's mother's boyfriend gets mad at Andy so he starts crying in his room and he's saying things like ""I hate him. I wish he would just disappear. I never want to see him again."" He's not talking to Chucky; he's just a pre-teen crying and screaming. In Andy's mind Chucky is just a doll still. He's not yet fully aware of how capable it is. Chucky is seeing this and does what it thinks it should do... In another scene, Andy is talking to his neighbor, and she just nonchalantly says, ""Andy, you're my best friend"". Chucky overhears this and his programming won't allow for someone else to be Andy's best friend... Finally, once Andy realizes what Chucky is fully capable of, he breaks the chip inside the doll and throws it away never to be seen again. Or so he thought. Obviously, Chucky won't stand for this...I thought that this was an interesting take. It's a big risk they took making such a fundamental change but overall I think, if you're a fan of slasher movies and are a fan of the other Child's Play movies, then in order to enjoy this one you really have to mentally seperate the previous movies with this new reboot. If you accept the change before going into the movie you'd appreciate it more.How would I rate it? Loyal fans of the originals may hate this new take because of the change in the origin / character. That being said I consider myself a big fan of the Child's Play and Chucky movies and despite the change I enjoyed this movie. I think it's entertaining enough for the average horror fan. I wouldn't say it's a must-see. The new Halloween (2018) is a must-see for horror fans. That was intense. This was entertaining. I'd compare it to a longer version of a black mirror episode.",Child's Play

I knew of course they would make changes, but they basically changed the entire story with just one (main) change: There is no Charles Lee Ray. Chucky, or Buddi in this depiction, is now simply just a smartdoll gone haywire. He's not evil or possessed, he's just basically just a broken computer. Why??! It really ruined the entire thing for me. It just seems like a nonsense decision by the writers and completely takes away what made Child's Play so fun in the first place. Don't get me wrong there are a few fun moments but ultimately it fell flat. Had they done a completely different story separate from Child's Play with different characters, I'd probably have given it a higher rating.

Also, except from Andy the characters in this movie aren't even a little bit sympathetic, the plot lacks of any development of any character.

540,jayroach,True Chucky fans may have some questions.,7,25 June 2019,"No matter where Luke Skywalker goes, aka Mark Hamill, he always finds a way to use the force. If Luke had turned to the dark side, this is how it would have ended up. Mind full of evil, and very twisted, and a killing machine. May the force be with you Mark Hamill, always!The original movie will never be out done. This movie is part remake and part modern day technological ideas. Some scenes replay along with the original film, and the characters have the same names. The huge difference in this one was that Chucky is a forever learning psychic super computer. He has to learn how to interact and eventually learn how to punish and kill. There is no soul in this doll, like Charles Lee Ray in the original movie. There is no human soul transfer into the doll. This Chucky was hacked by a mad manufacturer changing the doll's protocols and safety barriers. The programming is hacked with this military like microchip that turns this childs' toy into a weapon. It's exactly like how the toys in the movie ""Small Soldiers"" were created. They were upgraded with military microchips that gave them thoughts and decisions and emotions. Don't worry, they don't fry Chucky with electromagnetic pulses.
Mark Hamill did a pretty astonishing job voicing Chucky in his own unique way. They could have brought back Brad Dourif as Chucky, because it's really hard to watch Chucky with a different voice and no human soul transfer. Maybe they asked Brad to return and he decided to retire as Chucky or he just wants to keep his version of the Chucky series going. I certainly am curious where this movie goes from here.
Anyway, I sure hope they don't make a sequel to this film but they might if enough people see it in theaters.
I would rate this movie 6 out of 10 overall, 4 out of 10 for scary, and 8 out of 10 for the alternate ideas veering in a different path from the original movie.

541,andwarren,"Quite different than the original, but good!",7,15 October 2021,"Honestly in the beginning when I saw it's a high-tech doll of sorts I thought it wouldn't be a very good movie because it seemed to be departing so far from the original. However, I actually really enjoyed how the doll is an innocent machine in the beginning that learns to be evil because of what it is exposed to and a lack of it's own moral compass. You actually feel quite a bit of sympathy for Chucky in the first part of the movie. But then, of course, he descends into total evil and goes on a huge rampage with comedy sprinkled in.

As a result, he removes fail safes and protections set in place, so the doll doesn't have free will!Now, if that isn't one of the most ridiculous plots in a movie, where the origins of the doll are of a super natural nature.The original movie that was released in 1988, was possessed by a spirit of a serial killer, that practiced black magic via the occult.Moving on to the acting....Every single ""actor"" was downright horrible!The kid over acted in just about every scene, So much so that he actually slobbered and spit during his lines!I finally noticed that he had an hearing aid in his ear but it made no sense, being it was never referenced, nor brought up as a plot device.Not once did he act like he didn't hear anyone speaking to him, so why even have him wearing a hearing aid????The maintenance man is a perverted voyeur, that installed hidden cams in every apartment, so he can spy on all the female tenants, while they get undressed. This movie is all over the place!!Both his friends were equally horrible at acting, so much so, they came off like they were acting in a Disney movie! If they were ""acting"" scared, i hate to see them when they're terrified.They were so matter of fact about helping the kid wrap a decapitated human head as if it was a watermelon.The woman that played the kid's mother was all wrong for the role as well as the entire cast. I thought she was the boys sister!She acted just as immature as her kid and his friends by stealing at her job and blackmailing her co-worker, so he wouldn't snitch on her.Then she's about to have sex with her boyfriend, not caring if her son could walk in at any moment ( and he does ).The doll's motives aren't clear, nor consistent. At first, the doll seems to only kill people, if they are mean or harm Andy but then he starts killing people for no reason. Yeah, i get why chucky wanted to kill Andy AFTER he saw that Andy turned on him.The doll's look, voice and movements are equally bad as the acting of the actors. There is literally no redeeming qualities of this movie, whatsoever!I cringed most of the movie with scenes that made me feel embarrassed for the ""actors' that said the corniest lines!This was a straight to streaming site movie and shouldn't have been released in the theaters.....I actually watched the original child's play from 1988, before i watched this one last week and it bring a smile to my face.Going in i knew this would be a turd, so there were no surprises for me....if you decide to watch this garbage, be sure to watch the original quickly after as to get this out of your head!",Child's Play
543,paige_butler,Don't listen to the bad reviews,10,6 July 2019,"I honestly loved this movie. I've seen the original and the story is very different but I think it's good, because it adapts to make chucky more modern day with the smart technology we use rather than an overdone possessed trope. This movie actually made me feel sympathetic for Chucky because it shows that he was innocent and kind and society/humans made him evil. Which I think is very deep. I absolutely loved the original and I can see why people are upset that the story is different, but this is a reboot so you can't expect it to be the same. There wasn't really any horror in this movie, but I think that they went for the dark comedy tone rather than scares because chucky has become known for dark humour. No spoilers, but that last scene nearly made me cry (you know which one).
Just watch it, ignore the bad reviews. At the end of the day, it was a very fun watch and I would definitely go see it again.I could definitely hear the Joker in Chuckys voice though, haha.",Child's Play

There's some awesome shots of Chucky staring in the dark that were well done.The kills are bloody and awesome, but I feel like I needed more. My bad if I sound like a snobby critic, lol.The cast is great and works with what they have. Gabriel Bateman shines as Andy, and is the stand-out acting performance for me. He proves himself as a talented young actor here.Concluding with my biggest disappointment. I thought Mark Hamill's talents were incredibly underused here.

But here's the problem, What made Chucky terrifying is that it was a possessed doll with human qualities, rage, and psychosis. Here's the deal, there is nothing skin crawling about AI gone bad, that's what the Terminators are for, and they were menacing, not skin crawling. In the original when Chucky went from cute doll to killer trying to tear your jugular out the face contorted and the voice became human and it scared the crap out of me from the time I was 14 to the time I was 42 and still haunts me to this day. This reboot will not haunt me. It is as scary as maximum overdrive. It is missing the personal psychotic touch which is what makes Chucky so terrifying.So it is worth the price of admission but don't expect much past that, or a revisit to the past.

552,sean-miller47,A Reboot Slaughter,4,22 June 2019,"This was the epitome of a Hollywood cash grab reboot. The screenplay was downright awful even for a slasher film. In this version, there is no possession with a serial killer but instead just AI gone rogue. Due to this, the whole first half of the movie is like a comedy with almost no horror or scares while they build up to the AI learning to be violent. It seemed to me like it was meant to follow the contemporary horror plot archetype of suspense followed by comedic relief followed by horror but they butchered it (pun intended). Whereas in IT and Stranger things the dialogue between the protagonists creates a lot of comedic relief, in Child's Play Andy is the only protagonist and therefore any humor from the other kids or Aubrey Plaza seemed forced and cheesy.
There were quite a few plot holes; the biggest being that Andy's friends initially didn't believe his story of Chucky being evil despite the fact that he attacked them with a knife before anyone turned up dead. I love Aubrey Plaza, but she was a miscast as the mom.
Overall, it was enjoyable at times but I think it would've made for a much better movie if they kept the Chucky as Charles Lee Ray. Doing so would've, in a lot of ways, made it a lot scarier and alleviated plot problems.",Child's Play

I have no problem with them wanting to upgrade the story, so long as it makes sense. But it honestly felt like a 7th grader wrote this script and that thing isn't even Chucky in personality or actions. It honestly does a complete disservice to the franchise and fans have a right to be mad.I'm going to try not to be all negative. Mark Hamill was good and the soundtrack was creative and good, but at the end of the day, it just has a nothing script to work with.So what about for average movie goers. The plot is bad, the dialogue is bad, the horror is bad (jumpscare fakeouts galore), and there is only one creative kill. It's also super predictable and you can see everything coming a mile away. And I'm a huge horror fan so I don't usually say that. It parasitically relies on your knowledge of the first one to make things happen. They don't even have a good reason why the doll's name is Chucky besides the history of the franchise.This movie also HEAVILY relies on another horror movie. Not like, oh it's influenced by it. No, that movie straight up influences the plot. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's pretty dumb. I'm personally mixed on that for 2 big reasons. 1. I actually like that other movie so I'm glad they used it. 2. The rights to that movie were probably really cheap so it feels like they chose it for no other reason than it was all Child's Play could afford.There were parts where I felt this movie could have been at least interesting if it was a standalone film with no ties to Chucky. But then last act happens and it just sucks. Don't try to be different if you don't even have cool ideas how to do it. This is a stark contrast to a movie like It that knows how to appease fans of the original, but also be its own thing.It isnt a 1/10 or anything, but I regret paying to watch it. 3/10.

It in fact, greatly improves upon the original. A very clever observation on society today; in how dependant and over exposed to electronic media children are today. How technology has and does develop a crippling (literally) abundance in our everyday life. How we use technology to communicate and not communicate.
The most striking details I felt was how Chucky was in fact not evil. He was certainly a 'killer doll' however, had he been given to a young girl obsessed with pink and unicorns. The film would have turned out differently. It is what Chucky learns from his environment that influences him. He learns from what people say and what children watch. Like the scene where the kids are watching Texas chainsaw massacre and laughing; we had been shown that Chucky had been asking ""are we having fun?"".
Please watch this film with an open mind, it deserves to be watched with fresh eyes.",Child's Play
562,youtube-05764,What was this? :o,2,30 December 2019,"Child's Play is a Horror movie from 2019 directed by Lars Klevberg.
It is a remake of the classic from 1988.When I heard that MGM was planning to make a Remake of one of my favorite horror movies of all time, I became a bit skeptical. How could they ever surpass the old film? The generation from the past has of course changed and that is certainly not a good thing.
Later the creator and writer of the Chucky Franchise 'Don Manchini' revealed on Twitter that he had nothing to do with the new film and does not agree with it. This gave me a pretty bad taste in my mouth already.
Has MGM literally stolen an idea behind someone's back without consulting? These are Don Mancini's characters. The story comes from his mind and heart. How dare they make money out of it? I don't like to say it, but trust me .. this film is literally a cash grab.In the beginning we see how employees are treated badly in a toy factory in Vietnam. One man has enough of that and decides to take revenge. He changes a number of things in the 'Buddi / Chucky' chip and then puts the doll back in a box. A whole load of toys is then put on a truck and taken to the stores. Andy's mother Karen works in one of the stores where they sell those dolls. A woman returns her purchased doll because he shows strange behavior. For example, he gets very red eyes out of nothing. Karen decides to spoil her son and takes the doll home as a gift, otherwise the doll would be destroyed anyway. The boy is surprisingly happy with it, since he has no friends. Later the doll starts picking up different sentences and manners of people and starts killing. If he can't be Andy's friend, nobody can.Instead of a psychopathic killer in the doll, this time it is a technical flaw in the chip. Well, a flaw? That man in the factory literally put it all on it himself. It was a nice idea, but I noticed throughout the film that the makers themselves no longer knew which of the two it was again. The doll suddenly knew everything, could think, jump into cars, also 'light' other dolls, put tape on people's mouths, tie people up, and so on. I understand that the doll picks up things, but of course he can't know all of this. No one has done this and it does not seem to me that this was described in his program. I also find it a pity, without giving away too many spoilers, the scene with the cat. Every normal person would have immediately throwed the doll away and not just give him a cuddly 'it is not allowed' lesson as if it was a child of 4 who secretly took a cookie from the cookie jar. The whole scene was not pleasant to watch. And that Andy later .. SPOILERS !!! throws the cat in the garbage. That really beats it all. Let's just pretend that's normal and that that is how it should be done. Super good example! -_-
The real outstanders of the actors from the film were Gabriel Bateman as Andy, Brian Tyree Henry as Mike Norris & Carlease Burke as Doreen. Very well played! Especially Gabriel Bateman at such a young age. Just a pity that his role is written so 'unlikeable' ..In short, it is a nice idea, but a poor execution. If they wanted to do it, they would have been better of doing it a lot differently. You could have done so much with this story. This proves once again that you have to keep your hands off from classics. Especially if the creator himself wants nothing to do with it and if the original franchise is still running. I am soon going to watch the old films again to wash away this bad version. What a complete nonsense this was..
So unnecessary ..",Child's Play
563,highgency,Interesting movie,8,24 June 2019,It was a really nice adaption but I would've enjoyed seeing more about the USB features. Otherwise great movie and great voice acting by Mark Hamill and also Andy. The scene with the head was one of the best ones I laughed so much in the movie lol!,Child's Play
564,krstnparry,So bad it gave me a headache,3,13 October 2019,Yeah the kills were alright the chucky doll looked demented the stupid E.T finger compley ruined it. The kid playing Andy had great acting skills. Felt sad for chucky when he got attacked and powered off. I have watched all of the chucky movies now and this was definitely the worst. They focused too much on making it creepy rather then gory which ruined it all. If they made it gory and had more kills then I would of give it 8 stars.,Child's Play

Only one question stays unrevealed in this case: how can you get your factory mass production item sold to anyone while your product is so ugly, you should prevent any normal child ripping its head off upon receiving similar gifts. About the comedy factor: compare to my aged aunt who could be world's most wanted standup comedian.",Child's Play
567,noahskates,Actually very good for a slasher-like horror movie.,7,26 June 2019,"I'll give you reasons why it's good. The lighting, the cinematography, the special effects, the acting, the dialouge, and most of all, the story itself along with the characters. It's very well done and visually appealing, the acting is very believable, the things the kids do are realistic to what children would actually do in that situation. The doll, Chucky, itself! Throughout the second half of the film you actually feel bad for the villain, the one killing the people! It's not very often that a film is able to make you feel bad for the killer in a movie, especially in a slasher. The story I found very intriguing and definitely brought the chucky character to modern day perfectly. And what I believe to be the best part of the movie, the masterpiece of a soundtrack by Bear Mcreary. He has proven himself time and time again that he is one of the most creative, original, and prolific composers of his time. Every peice of music from the score is terrifying and strikes chills down your spine with its amazing feeling it gives off, a distinct melody that suits the movie perfectly",Child's Play
568,SpencerPEvans,Didn't Twist the Blade Enough...,6,5 November 2019,"I'll be honest, like most people, I was skeptical of this movie, but I gave it a fair shot for doing its job. I'll be honest, I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be.Let me just say, despite most of its flaws, when Chucky is onscreen, it's a million times more fun to watch. The puppetry on him is very well done - just not when it's CG - and Mark Hamill's legendary performance from Joker was a good inspiration to have him be the voice of Chucky. I honestly didn't even know that was him the first time I watched this. Plus, I do love the change in backstory of Chucky in this version: rather than being a spirit possessing a doll, he's an AI who will always try to make his friend happy, however not always succeeding. The way the movie portrayed it was very nicely done.However, as much as 2019's Chucky is fantastic, he doesn't have a strong enough story to bear him. Every single other character is either boring, dumb, a bully for no reason, or just not important. It was incredibly hard for me to root for the characters or even feel sorry for their deaths. That's the primary problem with the film.All in all, I'd rather not watch the whole movie again, but I would love to see Mark Hamill's Chucky in a MUCH better movie.",Child's Play
569,maxtiggertom,Decent Throwback Slasher Saved by Mark Hamill's fantastic performance,6,22 June 2019,"This film was an interesting film for me because I was not personally intrigued by the film initially due to it looking like just another slasher film that tried to appeal to the modern era. However, that all changed when I heard the news that Mark Hamill was going to be the voice of Chucky. To be perfectly honest I went into this film expecting a typical slasher film. More-a-less that is what I received. What I didn't expect was the smatterings of dark humour sprinkled around the film. It was refreshing to say the least. A nice change of pace from the serious horror films that I have witnessed as of late.The actors were all good. The unfortunate problem is that they never reached the level of Mark Hamill who is most certainly the best part of the film by a country mile. I could just tell by the cackling laugh that he makes in the film that he is having the time of his life. They even sneak in a clever Star Wars reference, which I found quite amusing and raised a chuckle out of me. That's not to say the performances were bad by any means. Andy played by ""Gabriel Bateman"" is the second highlight to Hamill's Chucky. Given the material that Gabriel was given he put his all into the role. Thirdly is Andy's mother. She is played by ""Aubrey Plaza"". She is another highlight as she helped the film feel a little more grounded and relatable.The kills were another highlight as the film used the 15 rating to its advantage. The kills being as gory as they were will please horror gore fans. While I personally am not a gore fan I do appreciate inventiveness when I see it and the kills here definitely reflect that. The film does also offer some commentary on AI and how if we as a human race aren't careful it can take over literally everything in our lives. I also enjoyed the reference to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre II, which Chucky takes inspiration from in some of his kills. I think the film is a good throwback to the classic 80's films of it's time. It's inspiration clear and painted proudly on the film's sleeve. What I like the about the film is that, at it's core it knows what it is. A horror film. For better or worse it commits to that slate and I'm overall glad that it did.In conclusion, I can see this film being a decent date film or alliteratively a good film to go out to see with a group of friends. Mark Hamill being the best thing about this film is most certainly a recommendable foot by itself.3/5 Thumbs",Child's Play
570,ckmccabe,A strong modern retelling with modern problem,8,29 June 2019,"Overall this movie is leagues better than I expected. It remakes the original with respect, but adds new ideas to the formula which makes it feel like the brainchild of a modern writer or director. The relationship between Andy and Chucky is much more emotional and complex here, relying more on a bittersweet bromance kinda thing. The kills are inventive, mark hamil gives a strong performance and Chuckys new personality is very interesting. Maybe not as funny as the original, but certainly more interesting. The supporting characters of the cop and the single mother are also done very well and their actors both do a great job.However, it has problems, all of which are a fault of modern film. The CGI is poor in a few areas, which is to be expected considering the budget. Andy has friends in this movie who are hamfisted, pisspoor imitations of the stranger things and It kids.Surpringly, Chuckys reliance on technology to kill was actually very well done. I assumed this would be the weakest part of the movie and instead it was pretty solid.Like the original, this is a solid B movie. It won't change the world but it's certainly scary, it's definitely incentive, and surprisingly it has a good amount of humor (though not nearly as much as the original).",Child's Play

The positive part of the film is the genre that still up to the expectation with its story that demands technological elements. Moreover, Chucky killing scenes are well filmed with its ""watching by closing your eyes"" moments. The negative part of the movie is that there is a question of how the ""toy"" could have the feeling of emotions and how does it response towards its owner, Andy's behavior towards people around him. It is lacking of detailing the action as the previous child's play on 1988 has a flashback of a serial killer that posses the toy of ""Chucky"" and it has the reason behind it. However.

I was very very disappointed with this movie. whoever made this movie only wanted to do one thing and that's con people out of money. to me it's very insulting how they keep making Chucky movies and they keep going on and on and on with killer dolls. The original that was made in the 80s the original was the very best one they made and nothing in the future will beat this unless they bring back the original characters... it's time to stop making reboots that are trash. is this the worst movie in the world no but is it the best nooo.this movie is just not scary. it's very lame .it's the same old crap... this movie was made for babies or little kids that never seen a killer doll movie before .trust me it's not even worth watching just like Jeepers creepers 3 that came out. 14 years later very disappointing. I'm not going to put any spoilers in here because I would be wasting my breath..I've been a horror movie fan for the past 20 years . you go from something like Halloween too Michael Myers to Jason to Texas chainsaw massacre too saw too The conjuring . zombie movies too vampire movies and things like that. this movie or these movies are just not technically horror movies . it's almost like a baby comedy horror for little kids so that's how I'm going to end itif you want to be disappointed go waste your money and you'll be walking out of the movie theater within 30 minutes..... Not sure how much easier I can explain this to you .basically I am just really angry in how this movie was put together it doesn't take a genius to put a movie together that's a lot better than this.

As a huge fan of the entire series (okay, excluding Seed of Chucky...but even that is better than this garbage), and seeing the trailer for this, I went into the theater with low expectations, but had some little hope deep inside that I would be proven wrong. That hope was extinguished within 15 minutes of the movie playing. I felt zero sympathy towards anyone except for the cat. Aubrey Plaza is a bit mundane in pretty much all roles she plays, and is a one trick pony with her 'Eeyore' type screen presence. This movie is no different. The kid who played Andy is a decent enough actor, though can be annoying at times. I just feel the writers tried WAY too hard at making the doll modern, to the point where it was just ridiculous (do any kids seriously want a doll that can control the room temperature?). In all previous Child's Play movies, Brad Dourif gives the doll life and a personality that brings comedic relief at times. Mark Hamill did none of that. Though I can't put all the blame on him, as this Chucky doll never has a soul to give him that joie de vivre. Death scenes and gore were decent, and that's where it got that those two extra stars. I can really only recommend this to those who have never seen a Child's Play movie before.

It works because it is different enough from the original.The doll is not possessed but AI gone wrong. It's less horror and more humor. It's unrealistic sci-fi and very over the top.The original had a more tight script and 80's charm. It seems that things could be cut out in this one or pursued further.I definitely still prefer the original.

Being a reboot, I think they did an awesome job modernizing the movie. And how they did it, adding black comedy that works. Being a ""smart"" chucky really adds a lot to this film. A really different approach from its original, Chucky really takes seriously being his buddi until the end.

604,giftofgodoflove,Not a Child's Play Movie,4,30 November 2020,"Pros1. It's not a bad movie. The humor isn't forced. You care for the characters. The creepiness factor is there . . . sometimes. The gore factor is balanced. I think Gabriel Batemen did a great job. Hamill does good as well, but he'll probably do better for those who don't know he did the voice of the Joker for Batman: The Animated Series. Andy's friends are good. Aubrey Plaza is good. It's still hard not to see her as April Ludgate, but she still did good. I think Brian Henry did a great job is probably the best part of the movie.2. At least the characters admit the doll looks weird.3. Some scenes made me laugh. The doll scaring the crap out of the boyfriend while he's peeing. Wrapping the boyfriend's head.4. The death scenes are good and sometimes creative. The boyfriend falling off the ladder made me wince. The head mounted in Andy's room was pretty well done. Doreen's death was ok: just a jump scare (though I find it inexplicable how Chucky got 'inside the car).Cons1. The doll should not be CGI. I have no idea what spell has been cast over Hollywood. Their obsession with CGI is borderline neurotic. And if you're going to use CGI, finesse it with how the other reboots did it. Keep the look. It's that simple. Whatever Studio Executive green lighted changing the look with this off-putting CGI overlay needs to be selling hotdogs on a street corner.2. The movie is NOT a Child's Play movie. This is an odd Terminator kind of movie. For example, Chucky almost strangles the cat. Andy has to give Chucky this clunky ethical lecture on how it can't go around doing things like that. Sound familiar? Yea, that's what John Connor has to tell the T-800. Chucky is Andy's whacky protector. The only difference is that Chucky goes bad and it rides the coattails of the Chucky-mythos. The Kaslan Corporation is basically Skynet. The 'Buddi's' are T-800s.A Child's Play movie, at its CORE, is NOT a movie about AI gone awry. It's just not. Can I just reboot the Terminator Franchise by ensouling Arnold's character with a Protector's spirit? So, Arnold isn't a Terminator anymore and it's still a Terminator movie? Um, no. A Child's Play movie MUST involve a psychopathic serial murderer transferring himself into a doll via voodoo spells. If you mess with this core, you crap on what makes a Child's Play movie a Child's Play movie.3. Like I hinted at above, Chucky is AI gone awry. That's it. If the doll didn't malfunction, it wouldn't have gotten psychopathic, if that's even meaningful. A robots is psychopathic if we humans overlay onto the robot the behaviors we've deemed psychopathic. But it's not inherently psychopathic. It's at bottom no different than a broken microwave. The only thing that makes it 'scary' is the musical score that accompanies beep-boops.4. The blue/red eyes binary was way too flatfooted and unimaginative.5. The jump-scares are ok but they just seem to pigeonhole a movie whose mythos is canon into a generic, sub-par slasher pic.6. The boyfriend is too much of a douche. And Andy's mom is way too much of dupe. The credulity of the mom is so frustrating at times. But it's basically a necessary trope for a mediocre film. Disbelieve anyone no matter the level of sincerity, urgency, or credibility. You can still think live, murdering, AI dolls are probably not real, and still give an ear to, or listen to, folks with the noted sincerity.",Child's Play

The doll also lacks the jovial-menacing Chucky look that we were used to and thus isn't as scary as the original.Other than that the movie is watchable.

Originally when hearing of the Childs Play remake I thought 'here comes another thoughtless remake, just to make an easy dollar' but boy was I suprised when getting into this creepy and satisfying remake.

609,ezragarrison,How to destroy a legacy,1,19 September 2019,"This movie was so bad, I had to write my first review here in order to warn people, especially longtime fans. This movie is a complete abortion of the legacy created by Don Mancini and Brad Brad Dourif. Yes, the later Mancini films have been campy, but thats what lends them their charm, alomg with the personality that Dourif brings to the character of Charles Lee Ray. That character is entirely absent in the Chucky presented in this movie. I love Mark Hamill and his amazing voice over work, but this performance was entirely phoned-in. Perhaps he wasnt able to do much with the character due to the AI vs voodoo backstory, but either way, the character is flat and lifeless. Speaking of the backstory, the origin they give Chucky here is beyond laughable. It completely prevents the character from having any depth or personality.The movie has maybe 2 points where gore loving hirror fans will be pleased, but it's overall not worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the Mancini and Dourif originals.

611,Andy-1981,An honest review after all the phony 10s,1,28 September 2019,"CHILD'S PLAY purists -- and fans of good movies -- will find it hard it though to sit through this one. Precious little of CHILD'S PLAY's famed mythology appears in this film, instead opting to do exactly what most remakes do wrong -- ""updating"" the film to the techno age. Of course, the filmmakers fail to realize that none of those elements made the original film so appealing in the film place.Here, we have none of the suspense or terror that made the 1988 film so dazzling. The film contains limp plotting, a lame backstory, distressingly undeveloped characters, terrible dialogue, and none of heart of the original movie, especially the mother/son relationship that carried the 1988 film (here, the mother is patently too young to pass as Andy's mom).Chucky looks silly and unmenacing -- a real comedown from the sinister original. Mark Hamill has a good voice for the Joker, but here, he's definitely no Brad Dourif. Not that it would matter much, as Chucky's characterization is boring and completely stripped of any personality in this film.I'd give it zero stars if I could.",Child's Play

613,Dr_Adam_Warlock,"An entertaining movie, but **SPOILERS**",7,4 October 2019,"**SPOILERS** , maybeOkay, just to start things off, I skipped this one when it was in theaters, because I was against the idea of remaking Child's Play (1988). The idea of a doll being possessed by the soul of a dead serial killer made it scary enough. The fact that he was enjoying what he was doing and was well aware of what he was inflicting upon people was disturbing. Plus, Brad Dourif was perfect as the voice of Chucky. Also, he was seemingly unstoppable and even after he died (multiple times), nothing could keep him down. Chucky will always be one of my favorite horror movie icons.Fast forward to present day. Every single movie under the sun seems to be getting either remade or rebooted. Even the classics, like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and even Nightmare on Elm Street, got the unasked-for reboot treatment. But at least they stayed true to the concept of a seemingly unstoppable killer that just killed because he just enjoyed doing it. When I heard Child's Play was getting remade, I initially thought that it was not going to get past pre-production. When it was revealed that Chucky was not going to be a doll possessed by a serial killer's soul, but instead a rogue AI, that's when I chose to totally skip it all together.Last week, I decided for no reason to give it a chance based on what people were saying, that it was good as a standalone movie. So I sat down and gave it a chance. I still don't regret skipping it in theaters, but I will admit it was an entertaining concept. It just would've been a better movie if, instead of doing it as a Child's Play remake, it could have been about an AI toy that malfunctions, becomes self-aware, and start mimicking things that it's heard and saw. Plus, instead of making it look the way it did, it could have been made to look like a teddy bear, a harmless dog or even a cat. That would make it look more unnerving, that it looks like something that a child can trust. Most of all, it didn't have to name itself Chucky. Buddi would have been a perfect name for it, considering it was called a Buddi doll in the first place. Which would mean it could've had a different title together. ""My New Friend"" would make a good title.So, all in all, this was an entertaining movie and an entertaining concept, but if retooled a little in preproduction, this could have been a great standalone film, without having to piggyback on the success and cult classic status of a landmark horror franchise.7/10",Child's Play
614,TT-Tully,Another bad remake Don't waste your time,2,22 June 2019,This movie was just bad. I'm a fan of the original child's play movies and I can say this didn't even feel like a chucky movie.

I like the idea of an older Andy. Pugg especially has some great comedic moments. Aubrey Plaza was an impeccable Karen, and Brian Tyree Henry was an amazing Mike Norris. One of the movies biggest strengths is how it builds suspense. I jumped a bunch of different times. (Peekaboo) Overall it was a great remake that not only tells the story of a killer doll, they make it as realistic as it could be.",Child's Play
623,Starduster,"THIS ""Chucky"" may be all too true.",10,21 June 2019,"When I heard about this, I wondered how they would pull off this idea.
Andy is around 13yo in this. Why would a 13yo boy want a doll. The answer is TECHNOLOGY. People of all ages have become addicted to technology. They cant seem to do the simplest thing without it. So here lies the premise which is FAR more compelling than some ""voodoo"" idea of a soul of a convicted killer transferring itself into a doll. Its impossible by any standard.
THIS movie however is much too ""on target"" with the possibilities of technology gone wrong. While many of the elements are still not possible (yet) there is far too much truth here and THAT is scary.
The premise is believable. A doll who learns about you and your surroundings, Your likes and dislikes. A doll who can interface with other devices and alter and control the environment through these devices. Sounds exciting. We already have this. ALEXA & SIRI and other such devices are already doing this.
But how much should we trust and depend on this? How easy is it to hack or exploit these devices? How easy is it to sabotage these devices? THAT is what this movie deals with. Those who want to see this as just a dumb horror or slasher movie are missing the point. Our lives ARE becoming at the mercy of our technology. Young people and older ones for that matter have no real concept of just how vulnerable we are. Worse yet we crave these things and invite this technology into our homes and lives without understanding that there are consequences both literal as well as possible ones. Nothing is totally fail safe. In this case a disgruntled employee disabled the fail safe features in the doll.
While we may be some years away from having a small robotic companion that we can have in our homes, we move closer each day to the possibilities. Even without one, we are vulnerable to hacked and exploited technology.
The movie contains some of the typical gore. blood and guts we expect. Some of that is pretty absurd in its presentation as well as how it is dealt with.
The setting and situations of this movie are unfortunately all too typical of today. A single mother raising a kid in unfortunate situations involving poverty, bad neighborhoods, impoverished living conditions. A far less than ideal situation. This coupled wit a mother who brings her ""boyfriend"" into the home where he is there to satisfy his own needs and just finds her son a bothersome distraction and the sons attitude is likewise. The boy makes friends with kids who are more street wise and a less than desirable influence. He is pretty much on his own at times and he is drawn into a false friendship with ""Chucky"" who promises to be his friend no matter what. The issue here is that Chucky has no boundaries of right or wrong. and simply draws from things it has learned from watching a horror movie as well as observing bad human behavior. This coupled with its instinct to couple with any technology available to him, he is able to manipulate the world around him to accomplish the unthinkable. He can draw knowledge from the internet and interface with blu tooth WiFi and all compatible internet technologies; and he uses these to the Max.
We should look at this movie not just as a horror movie, but as a WARNING as to how our technology can and does go wrong. How we are advancing too much and how we are relying on it too much. Most of all, how it can be used against us? We can laugh this off or dismiss it as just another dumb horror movie, or we can look carefully and see how much of this is already in our lives. Its just there waiting to ""go wrong"". That is what this is. Technology gone bad.
A VERY honorable mention goes to Gabriel Bateman who plays Andy.
I remember him for another classy horror movie called Lights Out in 2016. He has been in some other movies that I havnt seen. He clearly handles this genre well. He is a very likable young man who gives us a likable character we can connect to and relate with. He is celebrating a (undisclosed age) birthday in the movie but one would guess its his 13th since it would match up to his chronological age at filming. He seems to dismiss the idea of getting a ""Buddi"" doll but is drawn in by the cool technology he potentially has. The key to a Chucky movie is connect with a kid who is in over his head with a doll with a mind of its own and out of control. HOW can you convince the adults around you what is happening?. That is why the original concept ""worked"" even in its absurd premise. This is little different except the age of Andy. Bateman gives us a character we can identify with and like.
The movie has its rough spots but overall I feel it gives us a solid basis for the plot and it delivers well.",Child's Play

It makes you feel what the character is thinking or feeling and makes you not comfortable, because you want to know somehow he'll manage to solve the situations. Another good point on this movie, was the friendship between Chucky and Andy. Somehow it's like father and son, and it makes you really feel sad for Andy, because Chucky gets more evil during the movie.

627,grabmoney,Actually surprisingly fun (please read all),9,8 July 2019,"I was skeptical going into this movie. Hearing that the critics scores were all 5-7 ish stars out of 10, and the fact that the movie was going out of theaters so soon, I felt I was risking some bucks going in I'll admit. But I skimmed over the audience reviews, (ALWAYS listen to audience instead of critics), and I didn't hear one bad review so I decided to go in. Didn't regret a penny. I brought my dad with me (someone who doesn't even enjoy horror movies), and he said it was one of the craziest movies he's seen in a long time.(Without spoilers given), this movie is nothing like the original. This is a completely new and modern reimagining of the original film. No need to catch up on the previous movies.Now I don't get scared by movies that easily personally, and other than 2 of the jumps, I wouldn't say this movie SCARED me. The best word to describe this movie is ""unsettling"". Child's Play definitely was NOT the cheesiest movie I've ever seen, but far from the word ""scary"". So if you're looking for a drop dead scary movie, this may not be it. But if you're a horror fan like I am, or can just appreciate a good movie, you will have fun.The acting started off a bit stereotypical but you can forget about that about 15 minutes into it. I always worry about child actors, scared that they'll be your average whiny and screaming kids. But like ""It"" and ""Stranger Things, this movie made sure the kid actors fit the role they played.The kills were brutal, the music was intense, and (most) of the jump scares were played out the way the way they should be.Hands down, I recommend seeing this movie while it's in theaters. If you can't catch it then, pick it up digitally or on disc. I think it's safe to say that horror movie remakes may actually have their place. If we can get more horror movies that have clever writing that appeals to the younger audiences of today, while also giving nostalgic horror movie vibes, you got my money. ""It"", ""Halloween"", and ""Child's Play"" have all done everything a horror movie remake should. I can't wait to see what horror movie gets remade next!!",Child's Play

More so lately, Hollywood has taken so many horror movies and butchered them. But I can honestly say, Childs Play, was an absolutely refreshing revamp on the classic. Before watching Child's Play, I didn't see the trailer. I assumed it follow the direction of its predecessor. Obviously tweaks have to be made with generational adjustments but the same concept applies. Without spoilers, I think sprinkling in more sci-fi was a key element that made this work so well. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was surprised! I like the message of how much we depend on all of our electronics. The way the plot unfolds, it's conceivable in our wildest imagination, given how much we now depend on our devices.
Personally, I think this revamp is really entertaining. And I went in as a cynical viewer believing all the remakes basically butcher the original tales. This Child's Play is refracted just enough to remember the original however still allowing us to watch a film that could stand alone. I think viewers will be pleasantly surprised!",Child's Play
633,aaronghead,Did we need another killer AI?,2,28 March 2020,"The movie was lack luster, no depth, no thrill and no jump scare.
Predictable, with no lead up for anticipation.The franchise had already sunk low with its 'of chucky films' (Bride, Seed, Curse and Cult).
But this was by far the worse of the lot and completely destroys the essence of the first three which were holding on by a thread after the 'of chucky' films.Taking away the supernatural theme and adding AI is making it the kiddy pool of movies like Terminator, iRobot and etc.I found myself unimpressed with anything this movie had to offer, the design of the doll was goofy and the red eyes of evil AI is way over done.Don't take away the supernatural theme of a possessed doll to give us some over used campy AI theme.Would only recommend to watch when you cant get to sleep, as this movie will do the job.Big fan of the original 3, but lets face it.. This franchise should be done and dusted.I was hoping the reboot could save this movie from the 'of chucky' spin, but no, I was eye fed  with this reboot.Very dissapointed.",Child's Play
634,fastfastfastradio,Better Than the Original,7,28 June 2020,"In the wake of many horror remakes being very bland and generic, adding nothing new to the original films, this remake is very refreshing. It's so different from the original Child's Play, that remake really is not the right word for it, it's more of a reimagining of the base idea of a killer doll.The character of Chucky being a malfunctioning AI doll is much more appealing in this day and age than the doll possessed by a serial killer from the original. Though the movie doesn't play this up, it can also been seen as a warning about the dangers of AI and the whole everybody's technological assets being interconnected. It also turns Chucky from an evil character to just a naive, innocent, child-like character who is well intentioned and doesn't think he's doing anything wrong. This of course is more realistic than a possessed doll, and it's also a little more frightening than the original Chucky, because the original was straight up evil and actively did bad things, while this Chucky is honestly sympathetic because he really does not believe he's doing anything wrong.While the plot is honestly nothing too special, the writing and acting very much make up for that. Specifically Mark Hamil as the voice of Chucky, whose portrayal is quite the opposite of Brad Dourif's original Chucky voice, is very fitting and also adds to the character's innocence.Another great thing is that it really doesn't take itself too seriously. There's many genuinely funny moments sprinkled in between the scary moments. The original film was mostly devoid of humor and took itself too seriously considering the fact that the idea of a killer doll is inherently ridiculous. (It's a doll!! Just kick it over!!)Overall, I'd say that this film is much better than the original Child's Play, but in some ways there's no point in comparing them as, other than names and the main premise of a killer doll, the two movies are not really the same at all. While there are some major flaws in it, it seems that many of this film's detractors are simply coming from the point of view that it's too different than the original, which in my opinion wasn't really even a good movie to begin with, so for me the change is more than welcome.",Child's Play

Psychotic dolls possessed by a serial killer's spirit is much creepier and more entertaining.The entire film fell flat for me. The performances were dull and just going through the motions.

641,miramaxbt,A mixed bag of emotions.,6,22 June 2019,"The original Child's Play is by no means a classic in terms of story telling and production. However it gave birth to an icon that a lot of horror genre fans hold extremely close to their hearts. The original Child's Play franchise still exists with a tv series being produced by Syfy, so due to 'rights', MGM could not remake the exact story beat for beat or with overwhelming similar aspects to the original without receiving not only backlash from fans but a very large law suit on their hands, which no body wants. Due to this the guys behind 'IT', which is probably one of the greatest horror remakes Or retellings of modern cinema, which is not difficult when you compare the likes of 'Carrie', 'Friday The 13th', 'A Nightmare On Elmstreet', 'Leatherface', just to name a few, had to recreate an icon in a way that could excite audiences again with a fresh take. And for the most part, it worked reasonably well.Child's play, in terms of the original franchise, has lost a lot of buzz due to quite frankly the creator Don Mancini. His approach to turn an iconic character on it's head with a more comedic route quite frankly took the franchise not into new depth of fresh water but to an abrupt decline in terms of marketability. Hence we have a new Child's Play remake. Which is a smart move for MGM due to the fact the character of Chucky, rather than the actual films the character starred in, has a huge following.In terms of this being a pound for pound remake, well it isn't, at all. Almost more of a retelling, some of the same threads but choosing to go in a different direction. Saying this Child's Play 2019 is fun, gory, fast paced and extremely tongue in cheek. These are all elements that original franchise fans have been screaming for since 'Seed Of Chucky', however this also hinders the film in some aspects, such as feeling rushed, jokes not landing & pacing issues when emotional scenes are thrown into the mix.The cast are great and I would go as far to say better than the original. The score is also fantastic and in terms of film making this is a much better film than the original film made in the 80's. However the doll design, CGI movements with the facial features of the doll and its limbs aren't the best, to say the least. The sequel to the original Child's Play seemed to use the best animatronics of the franchise and that hasn't been replicated since, hence the dolls in 'Cult Of Chucky' looking awful.This is a hard one to review as many people will always compare to the original and rightly so because it is a remake however it is so vastly different that it could be another entity entirely of its own. However as a horror fan myself I would say that this film overall, by modern day horror standards is pretty great. With elements of two of the greatest shows in modern tv, 'Stranger Things' & 'Black Mirror' it is a recipe for success. However it falls short in areas, probably due to run time issues, meaning unfortunately some characters don't get enough screen time or investment but never the less for what it is, it's an enjoyable movie.With all that being said I'd give Child's Play 6.5/10, putting it into perspective I gave 'IT' a 7/10 and the recent 'Halloween' sequel/reboot another solid 7/10.The movie is a good time if you take it for what it is, a retelling of a cult classic narrative without the lead character, and replacing said character (Charles Lee Ray) with a robot that loves its owner so much it will destroy anything in its path to get their full attention and love.",Child's Play
642,Blake-Brandenburg,Really?,1,30 September 2019,These positive reviews have to be fake or else horror movies have hit an all-time low. They removed the one element that made Chucky terrifying (black magic). You can't explain that element and that's the main ingredient to a horror movie. The unknown and the inexplicable. This movie deserves a 1/10 for the toy drone attack deaths alone. What an absolute joke.,Child's Play
643,longers69,Not child's play.,6,16 September 2019,"Enjoyable if you think of it as a stand alone film with no ties to Child's Play but it's by no means 10/10 like some reviews on here!The original film I felt sorry for Andy, this film/remake, I felt sorry for Chucky. Poor little robot just wanted a friend! Some good laugh out loud moments, however I'm not sure they were really necessary and it kind of ruined the vibe! It just made Chucky more likeable... honestly, I was rooting for him the entire film!",Child's Play

Endlessly making Spider Man and Batman movies because original ideas don't exist. But no one wanted a Child's Play remake. The original is just fine how it is. Making it ""modern"" just for the sake of making it ""modern"" doesn't make it worth watching. Missing: Brad Dourif as Chucky. His voice IS Chucky. This is like when the Hellraiser series decided that they didn't need Doug Bradley and hired some fat nobody to replace him as Pinhead. Missing: A single character as good as Chris Sarandon in the original. Missing: 80s charm in horror films. 2019 crap doesn't cut it.",Child's Play
645,simon-cataudo,Beyond dreadful,1,10 May 2020,"Even as a stand-alone film, this is awful. The story is so utterly ridiculous (yes, I know it's a film about an evil animatronic doll gone mad) but all the human behaviours just Unbelievable. The acting is fine, but the script is terrible. The doll is somehow so much worse despite 30 years of technological advancement. The direction is all over the place. I knew from the opening scene it was going to be bad, but I very rarely give up on a film. I am questioning the sanity of the people giving this film good reviews. I've seen some 9/10 scores. Lunacy!",Child's Play
646,Metens,An interesting reboot,8,30 March 2020,"I've been a fan of Chucky for many years now; it was the first scary movie I watched as kid back in the 90s, and honestly dolls have creeped me out since.
But with the years, the Chucky movies have become more comic that horror - not less enjoyable, though! Just less scary.This one is in some sense not scary either. It's still a killer doll on the loose, out to kill everyone in its path. But we've seen that so many times before, that most of us has become immune to the horror in that.
And the ""technology gone wrong"" the movie uses to explain Chucky's behavior is also something we've seen time and again.
But there's something in the humor of it, that definitely makes it worth a watch! Just don't expect the old Chucky. Expect a clash between Chucky and Black Mirror.",Child's Play

I'll just say, I didn't expect much from yet another studio horror franchise remake. I loved the originals, but I couldn't miss seeing this. I liked how they updated a few things. Technology can be scary and this doll scared me to death. It's a different take than previous Chucky films, but I still enjoyed this reboot. Mark Hammill's voice as Chucky is on point as well!

This reboot was possibly the worst reboot I've ever seen in my entire life. The only saving grace with the storyline was the forshadowing of Karen being hung (don't worry she sadly didn't die)
Chucky had some of the WORSF CGI which I've ever had the displeasure of setting my eyes on. The ending was predictable SHOCK Chucky has morphed into another doll or was he using other dolls all along? Who knows because the whole story didn't make any sense. Think Sharknado but with dolls!

Nothing special but I think it still lived up to the hype. I definitely think it's one of the best remake I've seen. it still wasn't as I was expecting. But that's not a bad thing. I definitely recommend that you watch this movie if you're not expecting the OG child's play. But if you are, then you're probably gonna hate it... I think this movie deserves a 7,2/10

The story they started off with really helped get you into the mind of chucky and there is one long moment that is one of my favorite scenes of dark humor I have ever seen. I was laughing so hard I had to pause it. But it was the second half for me where it just became another run of the mill slasher and I was disappointed because it looked like it was going to be a memorable slasher film by the first 45 minutes. Also the ending seemed rushed because they started bring up things that it seemed like it was going to go on longer then it did and the plot points they brought up didn't seem to matter because all the sudden you where in the final show down and the movie is ending.
So this was a movie that could have been great that died the last half of it. So disappointing.",Child's Play

The writing was good, the cast did well with their parts, I like that they went traditional and used practical effects as much as possible. Mark Hamil gave his signature great vocal performance as the doll, which coupled with the animatronics gave him plenty of personality.
They avoided the worst cliché while really celebrating those old horror tropes.

667,markgucor-76267,It was fine,4,14 September 2020,"Now there is absolutely nothing wrong with taking a new spin on concepts from the past. Sometimes new takes on stuff can revitalize old concepts other times might just want to make you think that the old concept should've just been left alone, and this is the case for me in the new Child's Play movie. The old concept on how Chuckie came to life had a certain feel to me, and the new concept made me feel that Chuckie was a watered down version of himself. Don't get me wrong the new concept is certainly interesting but we've seen this concept in other films and it kinda doesn't feel like Chuckie, the evil that I personally wished to see wasn't there. The movie isn't a total bust though you still have creepy scenes, a decent amount of jump scares and a fair amount of gore. The acting was good in the film, I thought Aubrey Plaza great as the mom. She portrayed the pain of having to deal with her current situation as well as seeing the deterioration of her son in her eyes. I do kinda wish they played with that more because it would've made the story much deeper. Now Chuckie, I do not like how he looks in this film. The Chuckie of old doesn't scare you abruptly. You don't initially fear him immediately after seeing him; he's creepy looking but in a subtle way and what truly scares you is the fact that it is a murderous psychotic doll. In the new film he's ""in your face"" scary and too me is a shame. However Mark Hamil's voice in a psychotic murderous doll is really kinda creepy. Which brings me to my next issue; Mark Hamil is an effective voice for Chuckie but because of the new concept his lines are restricted. This is a shame because it would've been really interesting to see what Mark Hamil could do with the character.
All in all I thought the film fine, it was little bit meh in the beginning (with a scene that had horrible audio dubbing, I might add) but got a little bit more interesting as it went along.",Child's Play

669,tommullins-43222,Surprising but far from perfect,6,17 October 2020,I have to feel like all the 9/10 ratings for this film are people who like me went into this expecting it to be awful and have been pleasantly surprised. When I first saw the pictures of the doll I thought that this was gonna be trash. I have to say I never got use to the look of the doll and to be honest the doll in general was the worst part of this film. That being said however this film somehow managed to be at least half decent. It tries to take things in a new director and okay it doesn't always pay off but it tired and the film makers have created a genuinely interesting premise but one that's certainly not to everyone's taste. It's hard to go into this film without comparing it to the original and although it's not half bad it's nowhere near as good as the original but I would say it's a good one time watch. Anyone else feel this film lacked gore though? Like it's a slasher film give us blood and stop cutting away at the best moments.,Child's Play

Not sure where all these high scores are coming in or how they can justify them, because everything about this film is awful, the scenes are so boring, the cinematography is incredibly bland and predictable, the occasional humour is anything but funny, you just dont know where to sit with this film, you go in with massive hopes given the famous title and come out beyond disappointed.",Child's Play

(Yes even seed) and when I heard they were remaking chucky as a robot I was NOT happy! Didnt wanna know as the origional will always be the best! Noone will be able to voice chucky other than Brad Dourif! But after seeing this I was pleasantly surprised! It's fun, different and new! Kinda like chucky meets the terminator! But I couldn't compare it to the origional, the only thing the same is that some characters have the same names. And this is where the similarities stopped! And I was glad! This movie was a reboot or as i like to call it a spin off as it's nothing like the origional series and that kept it feeling different and new! It took the concept of chucky and brought it into the modern day and took us on a brand new story! The movie was fun, dark and gory! And after being very critical before viewing, this film is now one of my favourite movies of 2019! It will never knock childs play 1988 of the pedestal and robot chucky will never compare to charles lee ray! However it doesn't need to do this! It can sit on its own pedestal next to the origional and shine just as bright! I see this as a completely different take on a famous killer doll and they did it right! It didn't fall into the issues most remakes had where the plot is so similar you know what's going to Happen next, this makes it boring! (**COUGH** pet semitary 2019) So go see this movie! Look at it in a new light and you will enjoy, but dont look at it as a remake, because this film isn't intended to be the same it is intended to be different! Mark Hamill was exceptional as chucky!

683,tomtalker2000,Terrible Reboot Of A Franchise...,5,25 June 2019,"When Child's Play first came out back in 1988 it was a terrifying film. I love horror films but especially dislike creepy doll films. You had a doll that was FAR ahead of it's time. In terms of it's capabilities and what it could do. Add too that element a ""possessed doll"" via a Voodoo curse and it's all the scarier. That all said, something was just ""off"" with this reboot of Child's Play that i couldn't get into. Don't get me wrong here i tried my hardest NOT too compare this version to the original. But even when doing so i still felt like the various scene sequences were rushed and lacking in overall suspense. My hat's off too Mark Hamill being chosen as the voice actor for Chucky as he is just as talented as Brad Dourif was in the original. However, i think what killed this film for me was the pacing of it and too many kids involved helping Andy. It should have just been Andy and Chucky like the original without their involvement. Also, i'm quite old school being in my 40's so i'm not used too this whole AI doll thing and the CGI elements this film had. Granted the original Chucky was allegedly a robotic doll just the same. But he was flesh and blood once the soul of Charles Lee Ray possessed the doll and that made him all the more terrifying. Here we just had a doll whose program was rewritten too do bad things. Now that all said, it's obvious their will be a sequel too this film. But i'd REALLY like the director to do away with the AI intelligence concept. And somehow turn Chucky into flesh and blood again. Having a robotic doll just point his finger for certain objects too do his dirty work isn't creepy. It's just downright lazy and totally takes away the horror element of the actual doll doing all the killing. Chucky did EVERYTHING himself in the original and that's what made him seem unstoppable. Plus, and in closing, i can't see how can they even get away with doing a sequel. When this was a totally robotic doll. At least the original version had the curse going for it along with Chucky's blood too continue producing new Chucky's in the subsequent films that followed. So my final rating is B for effort and picking a great voice actor too be Chucky. However, a solid D for execution and how it all fit together.",Child's Play

685,hellfranz89,A lot better than I expected,7,2 January 2020,"Warning: minor spoilers aheadI went into this movie with basically no hope of amusement, and I must say sometimes is better to have lower expectations. The origin story of Chucky is quite different from the 80's original franchise, probably to fit better on today's horror standards; hardcore fans might be really disappointed, but I have never been too much of a sucker for Chucky myself, so I was really pleased to see how they managed to sort it out in a more hi-tech way. Probably not the most original anti-corporate plot, but still a truly fun ride of a movie, the pacing is never slow, the one liners land pretty well most of the time, and the characters are at least decent. I personally found pleasing the unexpected friendship between the kid and the doll. Not a masterpiece, but if you are willing to ride on the 80's nostalgia, take your chance with this one.Ps: my only very big negative goes to the doll design. Not good at all.",Child's Play

This movie makes more since to how Chucky becomes the way he is. It's about technology and how the world and story's are changing! No one today would say they wish technology was the way is used to be in the 80s, so why hate on this new film for having some difference to the story!

I can't get over this infatuation with comedy being constant in a lot of today's horror and super hero movies. Yes this movie was funny VERY funny and as a result too funny! But that takes away from its integrity. The original Chucky was a human in a doll. This reminds me of a cyborg from Terminator. This one was a real stinker as I was hoping more from my childhood ghoulish friend. All the time I was wondering if the voice of Chucky was going to suck. I was hoping that Brads voice would be portrayed in a great way. That ended up being the least of what's wrong with this picture. Andy's actor was great as an actor but just put into the worst reboot possible. Pass on this. If you have to see this see it at home when you borrow someone else's Blu Ray.,Child's Play

The film itself felt a little rushed in parts but overall was a very fun watch. Gave a couple of laughs, a couple of scares and some amazing gore. Only reason I won't rate this 10/10 is because i feel it has been heavily restricted with its 15 Cert if this was an 18 I believe it would of been so much better. Not gonna lie really hoping for a sequel!",Child's Play
690,hdelacruz,A spin on a classic,8,11 September 2019,"I watched this expecting to hate it but it's just different. I think it's a little creepier as it translates the child's play story to the modern world. There could have been a little more character development without the cliche implied backstory of the main characters. But, honestly, I didnt watch this movie for that. I watched to see my boi chucky. It's just a good 'ol quirky doll slasher. Though, I did expect some sort of ade due demballa scene. Whatever your expectations are comparing to the original, throw it out the window. It's a complete rewrite with different origins and different motives. I can see how sequels can come out of this, like chucky sending himself in the cloud and going into another body or even uploading himself to some sort of super-robodoll. Interesting. Fun concept.",Child's Play
691,bbwilliams-84135,Surprised!,9,20 June 2019,I was kind of nervous about this one but when I saw I completely forgot that I ever was this was fun exciting and shocking! And Mark Hamill is a great choice to voice Chucks!!!,Child's Play
692,supermlman,"Good, held back by some unnecesary problems",7,20 June 2019,"This movie was very entertaining and, dare I say, better than the original. The movie starts out good and gets really intense at some points. The changes that were made surely set it apart from the original, which is a good thing. Too often do you see a ""remake"" which is just a recycling of old material.
The actors perform well, both the adults and the children. The characters themselves are nothing special, but they were sympathetic enough for you to care about them. Mark Hamill's performance was good, as expected. The music didn't do much for me to be honest. Some tunes helped create some tension, others didn't, but the music never got so bad that it started to distract you.My first problem comes with Chucky himself. Not as a character, but from the fact that he just looks... weird. His design is ok, but it looked like his face was almost completely CG throughout the movie. I'm not sure if the entire doll was CG (in some scenes it most definitely was) but sometimes you can clearly see his face is fake. This is disappointing: if the original could afford to make actual functioning robots to use them in the movie, this new version should have been able to use that too. Sometimes it just looks better if it's really there.
My second problem: the jumpscares. There's a lot of them. If jumpscares are your thing, you will LOVE this movie. I personally despise them. And they were so unnecessary too: the movie had some good/great scenes that were pretty terrifying or at least creepy without needing a sudden moment of silence, followed by an extremely loud sound just to make you fall back in your chair for a second.
The third problem is that the movie runs out of steam at some point, about halfway through. Like I said, the movie gets pretty intense, but it seems like the best stuff came in the first half (between the annoying jumpscares) and then in the second half, especially during the climax, the movie becomes a bit tame.In conclusion, apart from some things that could have been done better, Child's Play is a decent horror flick definitely worth seeing at least once. A 7/10 is well-earned. Let's just hope sequel-itis will stay away from this one before we get another movie with killer doll sex or killer doll kids with gender dysphoria or something similar.",Child's Play

Better than the original even tho it's a new Twist. Who knew Mark Hamill aka Luke Skywalker could make a chilling and creepy doll come to live and kill people.

""Buddi"" (essentially diving straight in the water, rather then slowly walking into the pool step by step) Buddi is an adorable, children's, AI robot toy, that's able to make life easier and convienient, all while being a child's best friend. Karen (Aubrey Plaza) works at a Walmart esque retail store called ""Zed Mart"" who happens to sell the hot new toy. it's her son (Andy's) birthday, and what better gift for an introvert than a best friend... Sounds cute right? haha WRONG!!!! Well it is all cute and cuddly until the AI toy starts to retain information like a sponge..

That said, I liked the direction they went with it. The ""AI with potential to learn unlimited things without conscience"" felt like a warning as much as it did a movie. Mark Hamill was pretty good as the new voice of Chucky. And while it is not a continuation of the original series, there are multiple nods to the original series throughout the movie (kind of a ""see if you can spot them all"").Cons: It took way too long for the central plot to take hold.

713,rege101,Pure Rubbish,2,16 September 2019,"Dear Mr. Hamill,
I have to admit that I've never been a fan of yours. I have always sympathized Darth Vader but you've most definitely created a legend when you played Luke Skywalker.
I am very sorry that your career did not work out right. But with all due the respect I see no reason why you should betray your colleagues by accepting the pposal to become a voice of Chucky in the new Orion's remake of that great movie.
I can hardly believe that you did not know that Don Manchini was thrown out of that franchise without a penny of remuneration. His name, the name of Chucky's real father was not even mentioned in the credits!
I also doubt that you thought your voice would be accepted by the fans who have been associating Brad Dourif with Chucky for decades.
And most definitely you have read the script which was so ridiculous no decent actor would even agree to become a part of such a mess. The plot holes (or should I call them Black Holes?) were enormous. The opening episode about a homeless Vietnamese worker actually reprogramming a doll and turning it into a humanlike psychopath should have given you nausea. The rest was even worse.
But the worst part (apart the dirty trick the producers pulled with Don Mancini) was that your Chucky lost his sense of humor once and for good. His attempts to joke were just pathetic.
Mr. Hamill... You are most definitely a talented actor. But in some cases the desire to make money should be tamed. If you want to keep the remains of your career I would rather advice you to stop taking part in such devastating movies.
Your not quite fan,

714,fabiennehoogewoud-845-936458,What were they thinking?,1,17 January 2021,"Stopped comparing it to the Classic after the first 10 min. Trying to see it as an independent movie, and going by that: the movie is just terrible. Bad acting, bad plot. Its trying to go for a Stranger Things vibe with the kids? They add nothing to the story by the way. It's ridiculous, hilariously bad. Is this a comedy? Gremlins is scarier than this. Chucky: Cult was better than this. Chucky was unique because of the supernatural element and that the doll had a human personality. This Chucky is just an AI robot with a defect, learning bad behavior. It's not original. There's no purpose to some of the ridiculous killings. At least OG Chucky was in fact a serial killer so it made sense. No. Just no. It's not a good movie. Not as a ""remake"" and not as a standalone new movie.",Child's Play

Giving up Brad's iconic voice for Mark Hamill - who I love as the Joker - didn't give me a lot of confidence but I have to say I'm rather impressed.Putting a bit of a twist on the origin of the doll and mixing up some characters has sufficiently made the new movie different enough to not be a complete knock off of the original.There are a couple of memorable kill scenes and a creepy Buddi song rendition will probably stick in your mind for longer than you want it too.,Child's Play

Not a plot hole, but why does chucky look so creepy even before he goes psycho? I liked the black mirror vibe but overall it was a let down. The actor who played Andy was pretty good though.

I did miss the storyline where Chucky wants to become Andy but this new take was afar better fit for modern times.Although, at first, the design of the new doll bugged the hell out of me, I got used to it and ended up really liking the way it looked and the things they did with it. I still prefer the older design but I'm not sure that this isn't just because it's the way Chucky looked as I was growing up.The formula of the story is nothing new, separate the main character from their support network and terrorise them for a bit before he final showdown, but it's still an enjoyable plot and has enough to keep you interested.Finally, anyone who has heard his voice-acting as the Joker will know why Mark Hamill is the best thing about this film.

The chucky's behavior and return to her killer character were also very well done. The actors were also good overall. But the film couldn't continue its good drama, and the movie's thrilling moments were a bit stereotypical. The film's killings were brutal enough, but they didn't convey the sense of fear to the viewer. After all, the worst thing that made me feel bad was the chucky's face! Not only was this face badly designed but it did not convey any emotion to the viewer. While watching the movie I sometimes thought they made this doll with dough!

746,balthesaur,Surprising decent reboot!,8,30 September 2019,"I went into this film with fairly low expectations, but I have to admit it was pretty good! Chucky has a modern twist, where he is connected via Bluetooth, as opposed to being possessed by a serial killer, and I think that aspect made it uniquely interesting.

749,mbg-2,Great reboot and better than I would have expected.,7,21 June 2019,"Interesting reboot that may well surpass the original. Everyone is a bit more street smart and it taps into contemporary issues and fears. It is its own movie and doesn't borrow much beside the doll's name and one or two nods to the original.The concept is great and doesn't take itself too seriously. That's why it works and that guides my rating.I'm not sure Chucky looks as good. He looks a bit like Willem Dafoe so the visual contrast from innocent doll to full psycho is not as great as with the original, but no major loss.Chucky isn't quite as soulful in this one. There aren't a whole lot of one liners.Also, if you've seen Brigsby Bear then the illusion may be lost a bit because Chucky sounds a bit like that before he goes mental. Mark Hamill voiced both characters.",Child's Play

Fairly certain the high rated reviews are fake or from people who never watched the originals, possibly just bad taste.

Mark Hamill did as well as he could as an AI Chucky; however, I'm missing what came out of the original movie where there is a human soul that goes into a dolls body. AI just doesn't cut it for me and is not as interesting as what Chucky brought to the original 30 years ago. If the voodoo wouldve been used in this reboot the technology working on Chucky's victims would still fly as we all live in a digital age and like Chucky was able to manipulate Andy 30 years ago, I'm pretty sure he could manipulate technology to his advantage. It's just a more interesting concept using a mind of a human serial killer to bring more LIFE to the doll and more confrontation with Chucky's victims. Also, the look of Chucky was just bad. I did want to see a more updated version of the Chucky doll where he looked innocent but hell of more terrifying when he went on his killing spree. I just wasnt getting that with this version of this doll.I really had wished Mancini was brought on to this project with the other producers, directors and writers. I did hate the sequels from Bride of Chucky going all the way to Cult. Mancini ruined the franchise with those movies and I had wished he collaborated with the writers or just did a standalone reboot without the writers, producers and directors of this movie if they couldnt agree on how the plot should run. It wouldve been a good opportunity to get Mancini redeemed. I dont know if the TV series he's doing with SciFi will redeem him, but I hope in some fashion it will to make up for the other disastrous sequels.All in all this movie gets a 5 out of 10 stars from me. The action sequences/horror was good and as mentioned earlier the acting was good. Again, I was missing the psycho humanity aspect of it coming from Chucky himself!",Child's Play

In my opinion, it was terrible in so many ways. There was not a single connection to ""Chucky"" with this doll, and it being possessed by Charles Lee Ray, which was the biggest flaw because that's what made Chucky in the first place. Real Chucky was possessed by a human evil spirit and had a real human feel to him. Shouldn't have even named this movie Child's Play, give it another name because this dude isn't Chucky, just some clingy, goofy AI doll. His voice is nothing compared to the original. Not having Brad Dourif and Chucky's real voice was a huge let down as well. Then the whole AI thing made it a different type a film altogether. Going with the robot smartphone app doll instead of human spirit which is the real Chucky was a slap in the face to the true Child's Play franchise. The doll looked lame. It wasn't funny or scary.

I love Aubrey Plaza which is the main reason I went to see this film in the first place but honestly I was disappointed. I disliked how they completely changed the premise of this movie and the whole thing with the mom's boyfriend was just more annoying than anything else. How they had Chucky be Andy's best friend until Andy betrayed him just completely took away from the original concept. if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

This isn't the old Chucky where he is possessed by a serial killer, but an A.I. who slowly evolves into a killer. I love the kill scenes like how Chucky killed the hacker. Stabbed and Sawed.

The actors all did a fine job of what was given, especially Gabriel Bateman as our new Andy who definitely held his own. The deaths were gory, almost SAW level violent which will pleased hardcore horror buffs. Had this been it's own film with a different killer doll, I'm sure it would had succeeded far better since it did had a great concept utilizing technology into play. With everything said, is not a bad film everyone is making it out to be. 2019 chucky is adorable yet tragic and that's something very out of the norm from everyone who grew up with the OG.

768,ReadBetweenTheReels,Child's Play has its moments - but they are only moments.,6,24 September 2019,"This adaptation of the Chucky story is different to its original film of the same name in that what we had originally was a film about a cursed doll, whether as, in this version Chucky has had his built-in computer-coded morales stripped from him by an enraged factory worker.As of the opening credits, it is fairly obvious where this story is going. Chucky is taken in by a single mother desperate to gift the doll to her young son, and to everyone's complete shock things start to go very badly, very quickly.The plot is completely unbelievable and I don't for one moment believe that the doll could not just be disposed of (this was more believable in the original film as the doll was ""cursed""), yet it would be unfair to say that this isn't actually that bad of a Chucky film. It is leaps and bounds ahead of 'Seed of Chucky', a film in which Chucky kills Britney Spears and then says ""Oops, I did it again!"". Child's Play also pays a handful of nice homages to its original title. Finally, I think there is a Chicken Run reference in there, somewhere.The biggest point to make with regards to Child's Play is that for all the complaints I could make, I can't say I was bored.

If the only reason for it would be to reveal its a Kaslan product Buddi could connect to it to taunt him at the end of the movie, it shouldn't have been part of the movie. Like I said it's a great movie and I would suggest watching it (which if you havent yet why you lookin at a spoiler marked comment) but it bugged me throughout the whole movie since Karen had locked Buddi in the cupboard and Andy heard him struggling.

778,tenjin-81214,"Creepy, scary, fun, and Laughable",8,24 September 2021,"First things first: If you are watching this to compare it with the original then you are probably missing out the fun. The original was a good old slasher cheese with a killer doll. The new tries to distance themselves from that (more slash and less cheese). As such, if you want the classic then go watch the original. For everyone else, this movie is a great reboot.This movie is very good at its world building. It keeps it simple, makes it easy to follow, and it keeps to its universe's logic. It shies away from magic and offers more practical reasons for why things are happening. This allows the progression of characters to feel more realistic and relatable (Most characters anyway).This movie is a great treat for slasher fans and well suited to be watched during Halloween.*Some may consider this a spoiler as it describes the main villain (Chucky)**If you don't want to know anything about the doll before watching the movie, then don't read any further**You've been warned*As a big con (for me), I would say I didn't like the look of Chucky. There was something more appealing about a round cheeked, cute and creepy killer doll (classic design). The classic Good Guy Doll would pass for a kids toy for its time. The new Buddi Doll however; I can't see any kid wanting to buy it. The new design (appearance) makes the toy line look like aged dwarfs with Satan's eyes. No kid in their right mind would buy that let alone an adult buying their kid one.Chucky's character however is definitely a upgrade. Chucky's new backstory is genuinely how many haunted stories are born and its deliciously juicy for story lovers. It offers just enough for the audience to decide if there was something super natural or not.",Child's Play

We don't even get his name.Looks: I guess the people designing the new Chucky looked at the original and thought it was popular because it was ugly and had bad animatronic. None of that is true. However they now went to design not 1 but 3 different Buddis that looked all so terrible unlikable, it was verz hard to believe any company would ever put something in the shelves like that - even if this plays in an alternate reality.The orignial Chucky was cool and crayz, he was actually a lunatic, with a soul, the story was much deeper and it dragged you into his world. He had his own agenda.The new one is more like a ""how smart toys could go evil"" and ""beware of the smart home, people"". Wow.. very modern. Also some self learning and AI in there too. This tries so hard to fit in current time while making everything wrong.Everything is so pointless and forced. The movie has no flow. There is no curve, no real protagonist.

782,nzy919,Pathetic attempt at a remake/ stick to the original classic,1,4 July 2019,"I wish I could have given it zero stars, the first thing wrong was this was supposed to be a remake of child's play it went totally opposite and wasn't even the same movie. For starters he isn't even a good guy doll he's called a buddie, secondly it's a robot and it's not even possessed like in the original by the lakeshore strangler Charles Lee ray who's nickname is chucky. Andy is more older in his teens while his mom seems to be a drunk. The look of chucky isn't even the same given it has red hair but when chucky gets mad his eyes glow red and that's when the killing starts which was mediocre and way too fake to even look real. The robot has no soul and the whole point of a remake is to change some things but still sticking to the original. It shouldn't even be called Child's Play because that's not what it represented. Not to mention the kids in it are so immature trying to make comedic jokes that fall short , not only to mention but towards the end everything gets even worse when customers are trying to get the new upgraded robot, it's like a iPhone on crack but with a face but even in the end they show a teddy bear version of chucky that looks like a knock off of teddy ruxben a popular talking bear in the 80s. Don't waste your money if you want to watch chucky, go watch the originals plus there is one more that will come out ending the chucky series which was the takeoff from the last film cult where he got a body finally and rode off with Tiffany in her car with her body since she got another one in seed of chucky.

I grew up as a huge fan of the chuckster. I remember clearly, seeing the trailer for child's play 2 when I was very young, was the first time I remember being excited about a movie coming out. Since then every time a new Chucky movie was announce I always looked forward to it. When the remake was announced it was no different. I followed every update and tease leading up to the release. I left the theater only disappointed that there was not more time to develop the characters and the plot. Other than that this take on Chucky is very clever and interesting, and I want more!! Mark Hamill did an excellent job with the voice, the actors were perfectly cast, the atmosphere and score was spot on. As a huge fan of the original I still look forward to seeing the old Chucky in future movies and series, but if I had to choose, I am leaning towards more interest in where this new story can go. I believe any reviews of this movie below 7 out of 10 is a total under appreciation.

I liked the recent Curse and Cult of Chucky movies but it's still more or less the same stuff. This remake did a great job of giving us a new take where it wasn't handled horribly and made it scary and funny and even heartfelt at times. I thought Mark Hamil was an AMAZING choice and was my favorite thing about the movie. The casting was great and that damn Buddy song is stuck in my head in the best way possible. My only complaint was that ending seemed a bit rushed but the movie was still so much fun and really well made. The lighting and cinematography in this was gorgeous and really popped. Just go and judge for yourself. I went in with an open mind and I literally came out smiling and feeling good. I'm a big horror fan and for me this ranks up there with The Hills Have Eyes remake which is a supremely done remake and in my opinion the definitive version of that story. I will say I love the voodoo magic serial killer aspect of the original child's play which this one loses, but I think this one picks a more modern plot device and handles it in the best way possible and with great intentional laughs and horror.",Child's Play
792,invisiblephrend,Wasted potential,4,20 October 2020,"So, I'll give an honest star rating rather than join the battle of 1's, 9's, and 10's which are blown out of proportion. I don't hate the movie. It has its moments, but it's hardly memorable either. And I'm not against remakes or reimagining the story of a classic horror film. Rob Zombie's Halloween remake was phenomenal, for example. But imagine my excitement when I found out that the same people who ruined IT were behind the production of this dud. This ""modernization"" of Chucky was just lazy and desperate to be different. I hated the new doll design, hated the voice actor even more, and we went from a sadistic, quick-witted serial killer possessing a child's doll to an autistic dwarf with wi-fi abilities. There's no conviction whatsoever in any of the characters. It's also missing the dark and sociopathic nature that made the original Chucky so terrifying.

She didn't like that ""Chucky"" was not really Chucky, he was just a bad doll that a disgruntled employee sabotaged as revenge, no connection to Charles Lee Ray. She was also upset that Chucky looked so different, the worst/weirdest looking Chucky so far. A few of the Chucky movies have been pretty far out there, even campy, which is part of their appeal, to see how crazy they can be. But this one was just a big let down. The technology aspect was trying too hard, and Andy and his friends reminded me too much of the kids from the new IT movie.

797,probst54,"Why was this titled ""Child's play""? Chucky was missing from his movie.",1,22 June 2019,"Ex-machina has a better Ai villain, than this rendition of ""Child's play. After watching this I'm entirely surprised by all of the positive reviews. It's no wonder when the studio approached the original creators to executive produce this version, they were met with laughter. Very poor excuse of a horror film, poor execution overall, and has zero similarity to the original ""Child's Play"". Only people without reference of the original story, that like predictable jump scares, would enjoy this film. More power to you if you liked it, but there were many issues with the film altogether. I anticipate a reboot to at least stick somewhat to the original story, instead it was entirely reimagined, and a total disgrace to the original franchise. Even the worst film within the original franchise, was better than what they tried to do with this. That being said, here are the glaring issues I have with it:1. Complete lack of a believable story.
2. Lazy writing, and loose connections to arrive at the climax. There were multiple examples of this, but in the interest of spoilers I'll keep those to myself.
3. The original disbelief of a good guy/buddi doll coming alive, that drove the original story, was entirely missing. The element of psychological horror in unison with being a slasher was left in the past, and traded in for cheaply made jump scares and nonsensical kills.
4. Cinematography/lighting was hit and miss, does this crew know anything about practical lighting tricks.
5. Casting was very poor, the supporting characters were not believable in their roles. I'm supposed to believe that ""Shane"" was a ""Landscaper/laborer"" when he very clearly hadn't lifted a finger in his life. I'm also supposed to believe the detective investigating the murders just so happened to be Andy's neighbor.
6. Too many shortcuts and conveniences within the story, that could have been written differently, and been even slightly more believable.
7. The kills made me laugh, and the way it was directed/written didn't feel anything for the characters. Lack of story/character development was disappointing, but also to be expected this day in age.",Child's Play

This version certainly modernises the franchise by introducing the idea of modern technology, but I knew early on when we see how Chucky is 'created' that it was going to be a poor film....you really have to question why they were making dolls that had violence and murder programmed into them, even if the default setting was to off. Anyway, as with a lot of robot / AI type films these days, it felt like the writers forgot that chucky was essentially a toy, and had the ability to learn and think like some sort of advanced android. The whole film fell flat on the idea that chucky was some sort of broken toys and drew too much from the original film, copying scenes and ideas.

818,ticook,Entertaining but far from good,4,15 October 2019,"As someone who's open to remakes and far from a chucky purist, this movie was just ok. Really had no character development, story felt disjointed and halfassed. It felt like they just threw a bunch of ideas into a hat then pieced it together that way. Acting from everyone, even from Mark Hamill was nothing to write home about. Seeing Mark Hamill was in this was the only reason I decided to watch this over Midsommar. I was honestly waiting for Chucky to go from robotic, cutesy AI to a more individualistic more realistic personality with some type of sinister voice similar to what Mark Hamill does with the Joker. But it never happens and thus, Mark Hamills potential is largely wasted. This could have been voiced by anyone else and you honestly wouldn't be able to tell the difference or make it better/worse. Same thing with Iago in Aladin. Why get a big name actor to voice such a character if theres very little dialogue from them and stifle what they do best? I feel Mark was very limited with what he could do with the nonexistant character due to shoehorning it into an AI takeover story. Leaves very little room to add the sadistic personality that the original Chucky has.I get it's a new take on the franchise but going from a doll possessed by a serial killer to just an AI gone wrong due to a disgruntled employee was just lame and basically removed everything that made the original Chucky scary and interesting. Which I also dont know why a person in a sweatshop who's job looks like it's just to assemble the doll and package it would have access to the code to turn off all the inhibitors preventing it from becoming a murder doll.
Nothing scary about this movie and the intentional humor was pretty bad.The ""friends"" added nothing to the story and had no reason to include them other than to try to cash in on the Stranger Things and It remakes hype.It's barely entertaining as it is but all the high ratings are very over exaggerated. This is far from the best horror movie of the year as other reviewers have claimed. This is a lot closer to the bottom of the list of horror movies that have come out this year.",Child's Play

826,ste-75711,Are we having fun now?,6,5 November 2021,"Im not going to lie , I had my doubts about this movie mostly because I've grown tired of the incessant remakes of classic horror films and the sole reason I decided to watch it after not paying any attention to it in the two years since it's been released was my best friend's critique of the movie , she didn't know whether it was campy or just dumb .. I'm gonna go with the first characterization and I'm going call it campy
Even though this movie is a remake and yet another movie in the Chucky collection of movies , it's is actually decent and does a good job at maintaining some level of integrity and seriousness while also being intentionally funny and downright goofy at times .Nowadays most horror remakes have to integrate technology into their storylines in order to appeal to younger audiences and actually be scary or even plausible in some ways and in most cases this is what makes them suck and takes away from the beauty of the original , however in this case the whole technologically advanced Chucky doll thing is very nicely introduced and does not seem forced at all . AI has been a common theme in many movies throughout the 21st century so far and its implications or possible dangers are things that are truly scary yet interesting to talk about or watch , this is why I think that this movie despite being a remake is a solid one and can actually scare you at times , of course it is over the top and thus campy and no ,most of the deaths in the movie are not possible or inevitable but even so they are Still entertaining to watch , the plot is similar to the original but with technology thrown in ,things are definitely different which makes it worth your while as it spices things up and puts a new spin on this classic. The acting in my opinion was both good and bad ,it's like the actors are toying with us (see what I did there 😌😂) and are acting ok only when they are up for it ,I must commend Audrey plaza tho for taking on a much different role than the ones she usually does which are those of the sarcastic , mysterious and done with everyone type of girl who shows no emotions whatsoever , since here we see her go through a range of emotions throughout the movie and she really showcases her talent which I greatly appreciated.The movie was much gorier than I had anticipated and even though I love gory stuff one death in particular stuck with me as it reminded me of a saw trap lol, which was a pleasant surprise depending on whether you are a saw fan or not ,overall the movie is pretty good and is worth a watch.",Child's Play

832,DatBoiChuy,Mixed bag of ideas,5,22 June 2019,"Many remakes and reboots seem to suffer from similar problems. Too many changes where the premise or message of the film is completely erased or too many similarities to the original film that makes you question ""what's the point of watching this when I've already seen this""
Childs Play 2019 introduces new changes that are welcomed but not that well executedThe biggest change is Chucky himself no longer being a Serial killer possessed doll, instead being a A.I. doll
In a way this change seems unnecessary but personally i can understand this change. Since the 1988 film was meant to be a commentary on popular kids toys such as Cabbage Patch Kids Child's Play 2019 makes commentary on our recent dependency on technology such as Amazon Alexa and Siri, so it is a welcomed change and distinguish this film from the 1988 film.However this does affect drastically the character of Chucky himself. What made Brad Dourif's Chucky so memorable was his personality, this did affect the later sequels where he became too much of a jokester but in the first film did have a good balance of humor and horror. This new Chucky (Voiced by Mark Hamill) does have a personality but it isn't as entertaining seeing an A.I. that even from first glance is creepy go evil than a dangerous serial killer hiding as a innocent doll that any child would have.As far as performances Mark Hamill did a good job as Chucky giving a innocence and creepy voice for the character. Gabriel Bateman as Andy Barclay was a entertaining main character, Aubrey Plaza and Brian Tyree Henry as Karen Barclay and Detective Mike were fine as far as acting in horror movies go, but many of the side characters like Andy's group of friends were incredibly underdeveloped. You can tell that they tried to go for an ""It"" or ""Stranger Things"" type of kids club vs an evil villain but it doesn't work since we don't get to know these kids except for Andy.My biggest problem with the film was the pacing. The first act felt like i was watching the film in fast forward which is quite jarring in comparison to the slow burn of the original.
I understand that they wanted to get all the setup done quick so we could get to the kills but some plot points that you'd think would get development such as Andy's friendship with Chucky, his friendship with the other kids, his hatred for his mother's boyfriend, all that is kinda glossed over in a short amount of time.
The second and third half thankfully are better paced and definitely get more entertaining with the kills that are pretty fun and gory.The animatronics on Chucky are kinda jarring at first but since he is meant to be a sort or robot toy you could say that his odd movement is just part of the fact that he is a toy so he won't have as much fluid movement as a human's soul controlling a doll.Overall while i disliked the pacing and how underdeveloped some scenes were i still was entertained by Child's Play 2019 (for what it is of course)
You can't really expect anything groundbreaking from a killer doll movie, you just wanna see people getting killed by a psycho toy and you get that with this movie.
Nothing amazing but still an entertaining time killer",Child's Play

Gabriel Michael Bateman does an amazing job in this movie really giving it his all and really putting a real nice to twist to Andy Barclay. Aubrey Plaza also does a great job in the movie, her and Andy's relationship in the movie gives a more sister-brother type of relationship. But i can also see in some scenes in the movie that she really is trying to portray this caring loving mother role!

That was a huge part of the movie and in the beginning of this modern version of child's play they create an evil chucky that is basically human error in technology at the manufacturing warehouse.. which honestly isn't too scary. Some of the scenes were definitely twisted but again would have been a lot more scarier if it was due to a supernatural reason... perhaps they can redeem themselves by incorporating Charles Ray into the second?

851,ShadEO9,"""Are We Having Fun Now?""",10,23 June 2019,"Being a life long Chucky fanatic, I went into this movie ready to pull it apart at the seams should it have been a badly made movie, but it wasn't. Not even close, in fact quite the opposite.Of course we are always going to find ourselves comparing between the classic slasher killer doll 1988 movie, to the new 2019 new-look Chucky, Childs Play. Which I too was guilty of doing.But once you adapt to his new appearance you might find yourself pleasantly surprised with how loveable the all new malfunctioning killer A.I Chucky is.This time round, Chucky is not possessed by a serial killer named Charles Lee Ray, but instead has been tampered with by a disgruntled factory worker, who switches off all Chuckys safety features, before throwing himself out of the window to his death.From here Chucky begins to learn bad habits from us humans, and aims to please his new best friend, Andy at any cost. Starting with the family pet cat.Without delving into the story too much, and running the ""spoiler alert"" risk, what I will say is this movie is smart, clever and really engrossing from start to finish, which will please most horror fans with gory deaths popping up in a timely fashion.And gripes? A few....First being the movies length, it does feel a tad shorter than I would have liked, I feel another 30 to 45 minutes could have given the story more depth, and a better understanding to each of the characters personality and drive.Second being Chuckys new apperance. If, like me you LOVE the still existing Childs Play Chucky horror franchise, you might initially struggle with this new look Chucky, he is kind of spooky looking to begin with, yet cute at the same. And although it isn't a huge mountain to overcome, some might feel displeased with his appearance in comparison to the original Chucky we already know and love.Would I recommend this movie to my friends and family? Absolutely! I honestly think you'll be pleasantly surprised by how witty and enjoyable this movie is, and you might just find yourself feeling a touch sorry for Chucky in certain parts of the movie too, despite him being a notorious killer.",Child's Play

The kills were much more inventive and they elevated the gore factor.The character development was strong, with a few emotional scenes. Chucky came across as more of a human character rather than a robot doll. There were so many Easter eggs and nods to the original movie.

However, if you have seen the original and or more of the Chucky series, then you might get disappointed by the changes.When I saw the preview for ""Child's Play (2019),"" I was extremely excited to see how all the technology and resources in today's era would remaster and recreate one of the most iconic films in the late 80's. However, I was quickly disappointed on where the theme was going as I watched the film. Don't get me wrong! It definitely had quality production, amazing actor/actresses, and great plot. But I felt robbed when I started asking myself ""is it going to show chucky getting possessed? the serial killer's soul inside the doll and causing mayhem was the biggest key in the original! When is it going to show that?"" If the original Child's Play was never created and I watched the 2019 version first, I would give it a solid 9/10. But because the 2019 version IS NOT an original, that isn't the case. Let's take a look at ""Stephen Kings: IT"". Why was that movie greatly successful and satisfying to its viewers? Because it nailed the original ALMOST to a T! the creators simply REMASTERED ""Stephen Kings: IT."" So, with that said, if only the creators would have simply REMASTERED ""Child's Play"" instead of turning it into a darker, more demented version of ""The Terminator,"" and trying to make an underlining statement that ""technology is ruining our society,"" this movie could have been one of the best horror films of 2019 in my opinion.

874,Bungeegumalex,Disappointed chucky fan,2,13 September 2019,"As someone who grew up watching horror films and the chucky series being one of my favorites, I was very excited to hear about a remake of childs play, however after watching it I was very disappointed. The whole concept of buddi being able to control electronics just isn't scary. The thing that made chucky horrifying to me as a child was that he was a serial killer whose soul was trapped in a doll. Me being paranoid of dolls in the first place mixed with this concept, just made the movies all the more scarier. Another thing, in the original films, chucky looks like an actual doll you could buy from a toy store. In the remake, buddi literally looks like fiona from shrek, with lots of cgi included. The fact in the old films you could see his was made of plastic and silicone was amazing. It added into the effect of him being a doll. However fiona just looks like she had a really rough day at the swamp. Something else that really added to the original films was how chucky's voice went from innocent toy to beloved serial killer Charles lee ray. Hearing how drastically chuckys voice changed really spooked me as a kid. Now in fiona's case, the voice just stays the same, it doesnt give me that same element of fear
The one thing all original chucky fans can say is that his one liners are the best things ever. And the "" one liners "" buddi had were just.....no.
the death scenes just weren't all that good to me, they just weren't creative enough. However I will say the first death did make me wince, but that's probably the biggest reaction I gave throughout the whole film, except for rage. And the one thing that really annoys me as a horror movie buff is the unneeded humor. In older horror films if there was a joke it happened because it happened. It wasn't forced humor like in most recent films. That probably annoys me the most. If I wanted to watch a comedy I'd watch shrek. But after watching this film, I'd say I did exactly that.",Child's Play

The biggest thing that bothers me about this film, is the very very end.
SPOILERS BEGIN HERE!!!!!!
At the end when the kids get together and destroy Chucky they really did a number. Four kids with Sledgehammers and Baseball Bats would completely destroy this toy yet right before the credits we are hit with the My Buddi doll smiling with the big red eyes. There's no explanation on how the hell that corrupt chip was moved to another doll or how it could've been spread to another doll.

If your an original Chucky Fan, you have to watch this movie to see how bad it is, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DON""T BUY IT. It's not worth your money. This makes me feels more unexpressed anger against the remake. The company, MGM, purposely made the remake even after Don Mancini didn't want to, but did it anyway because they had the rights of the movie. Then after that the story-line in the remake was stolen from the interview of Don Mancini's words. ""In my original script, The doll is actually a supernatural manifestation of the boy's (unintelligible), so the doll is specifically going out and striking out against the people this kid feels this unexpressed rage toward."" Besides that they name the doll ""Buddi"" instead of ""Good Guy"" try and be slick about how much they knew about this franchise. The thought of someone stealing another person's idea and using it because they have legal rights to it makes me sick. I hope Mancini gets better in his life as he deserves it. MGM shouldn't have done that. I'm disappointed that grown people would go that low and do that. THE STORY-LINE ITSELF WASN'T EVEN FINISHED, yet they made a remake.

889,cslallan,Better than the average horror remake,6,23 July 2020,"Let's get the obvious out the way - yes, the doll looks absolutely ridiculous. However, don't let that put you off what is a surprisingly good horror flick. This movie is by no means perfect. In fact, this movie is not even great, but it is good. And honestly, that is enough to elevate it above recent remakes of classic horror franchises.This is a fresh take on the classic script. It would be unrealistic to tell a story of a 13-year-old child wishing for a lifelike doll to play with in this modern age of videogames and smartphones. The film recognises this and uses our reliance on technology to re-invent the Buddi doll as a cross between a Furby and Amazon Echo Dot. The film should be praised for deviating from the tried-and-tested formula and attempting something new (for this franchise, at least).The main improvements in this remake is the character development. A recurring problem in horror movies is that the characters are often expendable and we as the viewers are given no reason to care if they survive or not. This film takes the time to build relationships between the main characters. It makes you want to root for them. However, the biggest story-telling revolves around Chucky himself. He is not inherently evil and, instead, is portrayed as flawed and misunderstood. The film attempts to humanise the antagonist and, at times, you may even sympathise with him. There is a method to the madness this time around.Does the film fall short of telling a coherent story with gripping dialogue throughout? Yes.
Does the film poke fun at mass consumerism and society's obsession with technology in a manner which is clumsy and lacking in self-awareness? Yes.
But does the film still manage to be an enjoyable 90 minutes of gore, comedy and suspense? Yes.",Child's Play

894,joespooler,A Great Way To Ruin Your Childhood,1,10 February 2021,"This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. I'll try my best to keep this review as short as possible since there are so many issues with this film.
To being with if you are a real Chucky fan like myself, then I suggest not even watching this film. It will ruin your hope for the franchise and make you feel like you wasted your time.The film takes the beloved wise cracking serial killer doll that we have all come to love and turns him into a whiny needy robot with the IQ of a wet mop. This is what happens when you try to incorporate a cult classic with moden political correctness and ""technology"". You get a movie about a clingy robot who has the mental capabilities of a 4 year old.The kills in this movie are pretty dull and unoriginal. Unlike the original Child's Play films, we don't see this robot attempt to kill Andy or posses his body. Most likely due to today's political correctness, the producers probably thought that putting a child's life in danger on screen would be too much. As a result we're no longer on the edge of our seats wondering whether or not Andy will make it out alive. Instead we now have to watch as this new robot whines and malfunctions.The casting is equally as dull. The original Karen from Child's Play fit the role so perfect. It definitely felt like we were watching a concerned mother panicking as she rushed to save her child's life. In this film it feels like we're watching a middle aged woman trying to bond with her son by acting like a ""hip"" cool teen mom. It's actually extremely cringy seeing this middle aged Karen on dates while her son is sneaking around the house.Overall this film does so many things wrong. If this was an original film it might be slightly better. But the fact that this movie takes on the iconic ""Child's Play"" title and dares to alter the notorious killer doll and essentially turns him into a wuss. Yeah, real Chucky fans are going to be pissed off. And as a Chucky fan who collects life size Chucky props, I can definitely say that this film is a massive disappointment. I honestly hope this film becomes lost with time and never spoken of again.",Child's Play
895,jeannarawrr,A remake missing everything that made the original good,1,18 February 2021,"I counted the amount of jumpscares in this movie the first time I watched it. I think there were 37.I was already unsure about taking a creepy doll possessed by a serial killer, and turning him into an evil robot, but I didn't think it would be this bad. There is simply nothing interesting about this movie. The basic plot is pretty similar to the original, but it takes all of the goofiness and fun stuff, and replaces it with teen drama and cat killing. The story is boring, predictable, nowhere near as gritty. I watched it twice to give it a second chance, and both times it was simply awful.The original Chucky is humorous, enjoyable to watch, and his backstory makes him genuinely scary and interesting. Turning him into a killer robot is simply not as dramatic. It doesn't have the same flair.

I figured if I could watch that, I could watch anything and my love for horror movies grew.This was a fun take on the 1980's ""my buddy"" and ""kid sister"" dolls if they could control your entire smart home, assist you with things and learn from you and the it's environment. It's a doll that does things much like Alexa or Siri. Believe me that after watching this, when Siri responded without being talked to first...it made me think back to this film and be thankful she is not a walking doll. LolI found the story funny, creepy and very in touch with the current times of smart homes and electronic devices.The casting of Mark Hamill for the voice of ""Chucky"" was brilliant. He adjusted his voice just high enough to still sound innocent enough for a child but it had enough lower tones that made it creepy. The best part of his vocal abilities really came through the ""Buddi"" theme song that he would sing.If you can go in with an open mind and not have preconceived notions on how the story should go or be, then I think you can have fun!",Child's Play

901,hotwatermusic,"Wanted to give it the benefit of a doubt, but can't",2,26 August 2020,"Watched the film for the 2nd time after seeing it on opening night.
Bulletpoints:
-No Brad Dourif
-Audrey Plaza is wasted
-Tweens cliche
-Like most horror remakes originally set in the 80s, the premise is better set in the 80s, rather than in a modern setting
-Very few likable characters
-Andy/his friends reactions to the things Chucky does are beyond ludacris
-The Chucky doll isn't scary in the slightest, I'd rather a small person acting in a Chucky costume than this
-The fact that this movie has a 5.9 rating whereas the original only has a 6.6 is laughable
Just like NOES, The Thing 2011, and many others, it comes nowhere near capturing the elements that made the originals classics. Bad effects and unlikable characters for young people that either dont give a damn about the originals and huge disappointments for fans who have loved the originals for decadesThe 2 stars are for 2pac, one of the few good lines in this film.",Child's Play

This was a terrible joke of a movie, what an insult to Chucky and everything Chucky stood for. So very disappointed in this movie!!! One, they made our new ""Chucky"" doll look horrifically horrible CGI or not, seriously the designers should be fired, two, the storyline was embarrassingly awful....really people, way to try and be original...idiots. And three, omg what an awful movie!!! Can no one come up with an original story without rebooting every movie ever made??? JUST STOP IT PEOPLE. Anyways dont bother wasting your time.

It was able to keep the flavor and fun of the original but tell the story in a new way so you don't feel you're just watching a remake. You may actually feel bad for Chucky at times so that right there tells you it's a bit different.At first I didn't like new Andy because he's older and seemed stupid to give an older kid a doll but the doll is evolved too, with tech that even older kids can find fun. The kid who plays Andy is good as are the other kids. Mom and the detective fit the roles nice and very different from the original characters which I think was smart. If they'd tried to just copy the originals it wouldn't have worked because we'd always compare them.I don't want to give anything away but I'll just say thanks to the Kasden cloud storage I think we may see sequels, and I'm ok with that.",Child's Play

It felt lazy and cheap - was this due to them hurrying production to ensure the film would be out the same time as the other 'Andy and alive dolls' movie Toy Story 4?I'm usually a massive fan of Aubrey but her role felt lazy and unrealistic, she was a massive let down.

I gave it a shot tonight and I'm surprised by how much I actually liked it. If you go into under the premise that it's its own movie, not thinking of it as a reboot, it's actually quite good. The acting was great and the story line was updated. Mark Hamill was of course fantastic (to be expected). I feel kind of bad that I hated this so much before even giving it a chance. Would I watch it again? Absolutely. Would I buy it to add to the collection? Probably, if it was a good deal. Will I rave about it to everyone I know? No lol but that's ok.

It's meant to be both horror and comedy.

No company in their right mind would build a doll that was psycho and then ""turn the setting off"" the amount of hackers out there would have disabled the safeties a week after it was launched.The original films killer possess a doll and tries to kill a kid so he can live again is more farfetched, but makes more sense.I even considered turning it off half way through, but stuck it out in the hopes it would get better...

With the announcement of the reboot, needless to say I was super excited! Of course I decided to watch it and give it a chance despite the mixed reviews. It's disappointing to say the least. The original was quite frightening with chuckys facial expressions and aggression. This chucky seems bland and hollow. The voice acting by Hamill is decent but the look of chucky is awful. Very awkward and cartoonish. The original which is about 30 years old has a way better, haunting look and the special effects are also somehow better. The A.I. aspect is relevant and a nice touch but the original idea of a psycho murderer trapped in a doll is a lot more thrilling. Some of the scenes just don't fit the movie and some scenes almost seem like they are bloopers thrown in. It's a sloppy film with not much to fall back on unless you love gore. Like I said I'm a big chucky fan and this is me saying you should avoid this movie and there would be no desire from me of a sequel to this reboot.

I wouldn't compare to the original films, as the concept is entirely different, but it stands on it's own as an excellent modern horror film.The story is engaging, the characters are realistic, and the pacing is just right. The film is a mix of horror and comedy. There was a surprising amount of comedy for a horror film, but it was done very well. The key being, all the interactions felt organic and not at all forced (looking at you Marvel). The actors all acted superbly and had great chemistry especially Andy and his mother Karen. Some of the kills were downright brutal, but the movie never takes itself too seriously, which helps balance out the comedy elements.The doll's look is entirely different than what you are used to, but it grows on you as the movie progresses. There is a reason it looks and talks the way it does, but I won't spoil it. Mark Hamil did a fantastic job voicing Chucky. He kinda sounded like a more robotic version of his Joker portrayal on Batman the Animated Series. It fit this version of Chucky really well.Overall it was a very enjoyable movie that flew by too fast. I enjoyed Child's Play very much and will definitely be picking it up on blu-ray.9/10",Child's Play
953,Soul_on_Soul,Not bad at all,7,20 June 2019,"Rebooting an original can be very bad. Expectations from the crowd vs what you get to see can be very disruptive for the viewer. Not in this case tho.Chucky's reboot brings the film to the current decade and is done well. The film was filled with comedy and you get a good amount of horror and gory scenes.If you are looking for a good time with your friends and want to have a laugh, this is a nice one for you. All in all, this movie was not bad at all. Is it a must-see? No, not really. Is it a classic? No, probably not. Does it a good job entertaining you as a viewer? YES. And that's what movies are for, entertaining the viewer and this movie does that.Right at the moment you think this movie starts to drag a little, it takes you to the final scene. Chucky therefore feels nice paced and the length is just on point. Mark Hamill makes a good voice actor as the voice of Chucky.The acting overall was decent. Not a single actor distracted me because they were doing a bad job. Everyone was pretty solid, i must say. Even the teen-actors were pretty good. (You know how whiney/cringy they can get in some movies).Want to have a good time? Go see Chucky. I think it deserves your attention for an hour and a half.7/10",Child's Play

Please do not compare this to the original Child's Play. The movie would've been stupid if they were trying to copy the original movie's plot. (FYI, I'm not trashing the original because I actually love it). I just thought it was very smart and clever how they portrayed him here rather than a serial killer possessing a doll. It was different and new so please don't make a sequel to this and ruin everything.",Child's Play
963,mamontanezjr,Liked the different direction,7,25 September 2019,"I found both the 1 and 10 star reviews laughable. I enjoyed the contemporary direction for this film. If you dove into it with the expectations of a remake of the original film, I can see the disappointment. Keeping in mind I was very young when I watched them, Chucky did scare the crap out of me. It's 2019 though, any killer doll movie is going to have the same appeal as any Puppet Master film. It's not the greatest film of it's genre or franchise but it had its entertaining moments.",Child's Play
964,seanfacebook-17441,Poor. Almost awful.,2,2 July 2019,As a big fan of the originals I was interested to see how this would pan out. Oh dear. To much to mention why this was so bad but shocking. Ruined. I will stick to the originals... Leave classics alone.,Child's Play
965,tank-43457,What is this?!,4,22 June 2019,"The original is one of my favourite movies of all time and a cult classic, this was barely entertaining to say the least. Nowhere in the description was this described as a comedy. We've seen this idea before in i-robot, turning off safe guards thus creating killing machines. Go see it if you want a good laugh.",Child's Play
966,jpfennell,Great!!!!,10,23 June 2019,I went in with no expectations and i came out fully entertained. The movie had an original spin off compared to the old ones. The whole ai concept was great. Kinda like a sick twisted black mirror episode lmao,Child's Play
967,craigkirk-46743,Terrible.,2,30 June 2019,Terrible remake of the original child's play. the original had a suspense and frightening storyline about a serial killer. I'm giving this a 2 and that's being kind. avoid at all costs.,Child's Play
968,jbell-24041,An hour and a half I'll never get back!,2,18 September 2019,Just awful in so many ways. I don't need to waste too much time convince anybody who might read this just how god-awful this movie was. Do not waste your time!,Child's Play
969,dl-90245,"It's a ""good bad"" movie",7,6 July 2020,"It's not a ""good"" movie.However it's one of the cult classic style kinda bad but bad good. With a few changes here or there this could have been a really good movie. The new premise could have been executed much better. Some of the kills in this movie were pretty good too.So in closing if you come into this with the right mindset or under the influence of whatever you like to influence in you might actually enjoy yourself.",Child's Play

976,schaefermtb,Chucky is back for a new generation!,9,26 June 2019,"While I was skeptical going into this movie (with the lack of Don Mancini), I was pleasantly surprised by the film. The entire premise of chucky being more of an evil AI than a possessed doll really works for me, especially in the ""Internet of Things"" era. It does a wonderful job of using chucky's technology to build tension and add to the scare factor, not just as lame plot-devices.Another thing that elevates this film above most modern horror movies is the excellent soundtrack/sound design. Just tell me that when you hear chucky's theme that you don't instinctively get nervous.This film knows that you know who chucky is, and doesn't try to keep its antagonist a mystery. Instead, it re-imagines him and delves into the situations that this new techno-chucky would cause. I would 100% recommend this movie to anyone that likes bright, flashy smashers that aren't afraid to terrify you - both with brutal gore and psychological tension.",Child's Play
977,anisha-61824,New Gen-Fears,9,26 June 2019,"Loved the movie .It was a lil' gory but digestible.It is a new generation film but has few scares as it's very predictable.First half hours are just not scary at all.But it's a good movie and Chucky fans should give it a watch.Even if it's not scary but it's entertaining and don't feel bored.Gabriel Bateman is the star of the film and does a commendable job as Andy.
It's worth a watch.",Child's Play
978,onofrioa,masterpiece,10,23 June 2019,Child's play is a very gory but fun film and he is my best friend till the end!,Child's Play
979,bertieww,Creative reimagining of the original classic.,7,23 June 2019,"As much as I enjoy the original Child's Play movies (especially Child's Play 2), this movie was immensely creative in reimagining and modernising the franchise. As many others I can say that I went into this film highly sceptical as many remakes and reboots often butcher the source material, however Child's Play 2019 was able to uniquely capture a certain dark comedy vibe similar to Sam Raimi's work; yet it wasn't forced on us as an audience to laugh. Mark Hamill's voice acting was incredibly charming and unique, using a calm and controlled almost innocent voice with a sinister undertone. The plot was very different to the original (dropping the supernatural aspect entirely) and the story structure was a new take on the worn out slasher structure. I especially enjoyed the film's use of practical effects and puppetry on Chucky, and since in real life he would be an animatronic it looked very realistic.Some of the downsides of the movie was the character development between the mother and son in the movie, I felt I wanted to see them spend more time together caring for each other.
Another thing was the final act of the film. It wasn't nearly as creative and unique as it could've been, and the kills started to lack in creativity too, yet this did not ruin the movie experience overall.",Child's Play
980,bayarneon,Reaaaalllyyy bad,1,29 March 2020,"Bad in many ways. Total let down. Sure some jump scares where there but not even close to any of the previous movies, especially the original 1988. Nothing made sense and it's funny how the original movie's doll possession had more logic to it then this one. Why did they even put a ""violent"" option??? It's a child's game!",Child's Play
981,christopherjohnsteele,I willed it to be better...,7,14 July 2019,"I already had low expectations, which helped as it was marginally better than I hoped. It's tricky rebranding and reinventing a horror genre icon and I've lost count of how many tries they've had a Chucky now, but brush that aside as Im happy to say this is passable. The theme change from possession to A.I. gone wrong is a little on the nose but prompt in this day and age. Chucky is creepy, funny and pulls off some nice kills. The inclusion of alternative versions of 'Buddi's' lends itself to a sequel, especially the sinister bear version. All in all, a good attempt at a reboot.",Child's Play
982,hugomorenomdp,Awesome,10,30 September 2019,"I give it a 10 for Marky Mark Hamill, otherwise it was a solid 9,5. Great movie. The best in the decade. Excellent.",Child's Play
983,lchristenson,Just cant,2,8 October 2019,"I started this movie like 45 minutes ago. 1. If you've ever seen Parks and recreation- all you will see in this movie is April Ludgate. She is apparently not capable of playing other roles. 2. Again, I can't get past the main ladies character. 3. I was verrrrry disappointed in the overall film.",Child's Play
984,tuttefrutplakt,Surprisingly good!,8,10 September 2019,"A remake, but certainly not in the traditional sense. Sure there is some resemblance with the original, but it has a complete new origin story for Chucky, to name just one thing. This one is Completely able to stand alone, in my opinion! Well done, I enjoyed it!",Child's Play
985,drolleston,Eh...,5,3 May 2020,"Ok so for what it's worth, here's my 2 cents. I didn't actually hate this movie as much as I thought I would, there's a few decent scenes & ideas, but I didn't love it either. Really like the kid who played Andy & the idea of A.I gone wrong, while not original, was a pretty cool idea. However, how this came about just seemed so stupid - the guy just takes out the safety controls & all of a sudden the dolls evil? Also, why did he kill himself after? Anyway, it was a decent idea that with a bit more work, or creativity, could have been interesting. Things I totally hated? The cat dying, not cool guys! Also, out of everyone Chucky killed, the only ones who didn't deserve it were Doreen & the cat. I was actually rooting for the boyfriend & the janitor guy to die. Par for the course in horror movies I guess. Also also, my does Tim Matheson get top billing? Dude was in it for like a few minutes most! At the end of the day, child's play probably just wasn't a movie that warranted a remake. Come up with new ideas Hollywood, seriously!",Child's Play
986,jamiepennicott,BEST CHUCKY FILM YET!,10,19 June 2019,This is now my favourite film in the child's play world. The acting was fantastic. Loved how the story was similar to the predecessor but completely new to fit into today's world with technology. Chucky is more evil than ever in this film. And the climax is so crazy I was on the edge of my seat. Go see child's play!!,Child's Play
987,larswegink,LOVED IT,9,27 March 2021,Maybe not scary but more funny at some points but I still really loved the movie.,Child's Play
988,rmkdec-27516,Childish,2,20 June 2019,"****SPOILERS****I had high hopes from the trailers and fond memories of the original.There were a mix of unimpressed teens and a few old people in the audience and nobody really seemed that they had much of a will to live by the end.The movie limps along in a very predicatble and boring way.There is one gory sequence and another is a movie on a TV that they are watching.
The teen girl heroine is just laughable in how tacky and pathetic it was portrayed.
The movie is not at all scary it is not at all funny apart from one sequence of a hair piece toupee flying off and landing on something.
The acting is average.
The original is 100 times better and of course this is better than sequels because anything is.
Came out deflated and wishing I had waitted for it to come on television.You have to be a die hard fan to love this or minium age to enter which is 16 where I am.Fits that age group and even then like I say no one in my audience seemed impressed.
Next.........",Child's Play
989,eloiseclayton,The worst film ever!!!,1,23 September 2019,"I was looking forward to seeing this film and the reviews seemed promising. My god!!! This film is terrible!!

990,konnor-17017,Underrated horror comedy,9,11 September 2019,"I couldn't understand why the movie only had 6.2 on imdb until I read the reviews here. The fact that people can't understand that this is a horror comedy or just can't comprehend that such a genre can exist is just sad.The movie is very funny and self-aware of what it is, it doesn't take itself seriously and shouldn't have to. The characters and plot are interesting and fun and the pacing is great, I'd recommend this to anyone that just wants to watch a fun movie.And yes, this has little to do with the old movies and honestly I don't care, as a standalone the movie is very good.",Child's Play
991,jamiepearce-74479,Poor remake,4,17 October 2019,"As a stand alone movie this is a cool, different take on the slasher sub-genre very well adapted to modern technology and issues with thus technology.
But as a Child's Play remake this is nothing compared to the original and butchers the original idea and character of Chucky, coming off more as a quick and easy cash grab than a well made Child's Play story.
I won't disagree with anyone who believes the later Child's Play movies got extremely weird and convoluted and I do give this film marks for it's fresh original take on the character but as a Child's Play fan it's nothing like what we wanted from a remake. From the design of Chucky to the way he is portrayed in the film and even his voice are all love it or hate it things. Personally I think Mark Hamill did an okay job as Chucky; although it's not his best work, I think it was a good take on his voice. But in my opinion the design of Chucky was awful and just plain bad in comparison to the original.I understand I will be biased but my final verdict is this is a Child's Play movie with little thought behind the overall narrative but not a bad film to watch if your a fan of Chucky or any recent horror movies in general.Plus an extra star for having Texas Chainsaw Massacre feature, although shown in some randomly edited order.",Child's Play
992,steven_beaubien,Not that but not great,6,30 September 2019,"Okay first of all Aubrey Plaza is a babe. Second of all. You have to understand when you watch this movie. It has nothing to do with the originals. It is it's own story. Yes, the kid's name is Andy. Yes the doll's name is Chucky. Other than using familiar character names. The story is completely different and completely separate.",Child's Play
