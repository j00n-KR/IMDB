0,TheLittleSongbird,"One of the greats of the action genre, and just a great film overall",10,29 August 2015,"Have not always been a big fan of action films, after seeing my fair share poorly made, dull and predictable, sloppily written and badly acted ones that delivers just as little on the action (the worst of Steven Seagal being prime examples. The Terminator however is like Die Hard, a thrilling well-made film that succeeds as an action film and a film in general, and treats its audience and genre with respect. It is also one of director James Cameron's best films along with Terminator 2 and Aliens.The Terminator looks great still, sure the special effects have not held up as well as the rest of the film but they are not that bad. The film is beautifully and slickly photographed and the sets and lighting are so imaginative and wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked and immersed into its world., and filled with sharp details. Cameron's direction is superb, some of the best of his whole career. The music score is hauntingly eerie and its synthesised sound doesn't date the film at all, instead adding hugely to the atmosphere. The script (including the famous 'I'll be back') is snappy and smart with plenty of wittily written lines, the story is incredibly engrossing and exciting to the maximum with plenty of suspense and fun.Action fans are guaranteed too to be thrilled by the action here, being both dynamic and thrilling, the climax really does jangle the nerves. Michael Biehn and especially Linda Hamilton shine in their roles, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character to date. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the greats of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Terminator
1,Leofwine_draca,A beloved favourite of mine,10,11 November 2016,"Widely regarded as something of a classic in the realms of science fiction and action films, I think that this film is an underrated horror film and may be in fact one of the most frightening films I have ever seen, due to the fact that I had a fascination for it as a child. Director James Cameron, better known to modern audiences for his bloated epic TITANIC, truly succeeded in creating a classic film, one which I would watch many times over his later, waterlogged dreck. THE TERMINATOR was a hugely popular hit and created a new movie monster, the big, silent, hulking figure of Arnold Schwarzenegger in what I believe to be his best role as an unstoppable killer. The fact that the monster is human - and thus able to hide amid fellow humans - is relatively original (depends on who you speak to, but acknowledgement definitely goes to Harlan Ellison) and his sheer indestructibility is really awe-inspiring.All of the different factors work in this film. The score is unforgettable, a thumping, deadly beat which turns up whenever the Terminator is on screen, and it sends chills down your spine (much like the music for THE OMEN). The film portrays Los Angeles as a dark, dirty, bleak city to live in and the film reflects this. It has a gritty feeling much like the earlier classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the little touches, such as the Terminator's infra red vision, are chilling.The actors in this film all give brilliant portrayals and are totally realistic, many of them have since gone on to greater things. Schwarzenegger emerged as an action movie star after this film put him on the map and has since become phenomenally successful, with a string of hits in his belt. Biehn has also kept in the movie business but hasn't found many hits like this one, apart from Cameron's 1986 smash, ALIENS. Hamilton has also gone on to bigger-budgeted things like DANTE'S PEAK and her portrayal of Connor as an unsuspecting woman caught up in the violence is a performance which brings real depth to the character. She turned this around in the sequel where Connor became a lean, lithe killer out for survival. Paul Winfield is great as the hard but kind cop, and Lance Henricksen, who was originally considered for the role of the Terminator, makes the best of his small role. Earl Boen is also memorable as the laconic psychiatrist. Roger Corman regular Dick Miller puts in a welcome cameo appearance as the ill-fated gun store owner, while Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson appear in early roles in their careers.This film is also surprisingly gory for a mainstream movie. One scene, in which the Terminator rips out his own eye, parallels the ultra-violence popular in Fulci movies. People are repeatedly and violently shot and mutilated. To keep things moving along there is a ton of action in the film, with hundreds of bullets flying everywhere and numerous car chases. The only spot where things let up is near the end where Reese and Sarah hide out in first a tunnel and then a motel. This section of the film tends to veer into mild tedium and is the only part where Cameron could have done better.The film has many classic, totally brilliant moments. One of these is the Tech Noir scene, which builds up suspense carefully before exploding into violent carnage. It's a nightmarish and completely effective moment, with the music slowing down, people dancing in slow motion. Another scene is the one where the police station is single-handedly destroyed by the Terminator, this shows how unstoppable he is and is again very violent and effective. The final future 'dream' sequence in which the dying, diseased survivors are killed by another machine is also brutally effective and very moving. Other memorable moments are the scene where the metal Terminator rises from the flames, which is almost Biblical, and the entire fight in the factory, which is basic human vs. machine action, where the Terminator keeps coming back time after time before being finally crushed to death.Cameron returned with a successful sequel in 1991, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. The film contained then state of the art CGI effects in the ""morphing"" T-100 terminator, and signalled the return of Schwarzenegger and Hamilton (and also Reese in the Director's Cut). Although the film contained a lot of action and violence, it was not as effective and horrifying as it was basically a string of action scenes one after the other, and more designed to show off special effects work instead of telling a story. However the sequel is still hugely enjoyable and well worth seeing if you liked this one.Overall, THE TERMINATOR is a true classic in the realms of killer robot movies, the best one ever made in my opinion. It also clearly shows how science fiction and horror can be mingled together to form a pleasing whole. An excellent film for those of us who like action as well as horror, it's got everything you could ever want: time travel, gun battles, car chases, fights, gore, explosions, fire, melodrama, romance, an excellent score, and true gut wrenching horror. Excellently fantastic!",The Terminator
2,SnoopyStyle,Intense powerful iconic,10,29 September 2013,"In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer AI that achieves sentient and launches a global nuclear holocaust, in a bid to wipe out humanity. One man John Conner leads the human resistance. They are on the verge of destroying SkyNet when it sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill John Conner's mother. Connor sends soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the killer machine.This is director James Cameron's first at bat, and he hits it out of the park. It is near perfection that started a franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting during his deliveries really helped. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He is the perfect terminator. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It is a sci-fi horror that doesn't let go. It has the production of a much bigger action movie. It is a signpost for a genre, for a cultural touchstone, and for an era. It transcends being simply a movie.",The Terminator
3,Hitchcoc,Amazing Intensity,9,31 December 2019,"When this film was released I hesitated, not being a big fan of Arnold's. But his stolid performance (without any emotion) was really quite good. The plot line of a thing from the future taking on human form and trying to put an end to a problem through murder is quite captivating. Of course, the issue of time travel to the past is always fodder for criticism. Of course, we have the sequels, using computer generated special effects (which are remarkable). I still prefer this first one.",The Terminator
4,classicsoncall,"""You've been targeted for termination"".",8,23 August 2009,"I saw this film in the cable channel listings last night, and by the time I finished debating whether to watch it or not, it was already fifteen minutes into the movie. I'd seen it before of course, and more than once, but I always have a fascination for films that struck me as groundbreaking when I saw them upon their original release. So I tuned in, and my review here has more to do with the perspective of twenty five years having passed since that Orwellian year of 1984.First off, I enjoy the movie, no two ways about it. If you can take Dr. Silberman's (Earl Boen) word for it, Reese's story is brilliant. But even back then, a quarter decade ago, I just couldn't buy the sheer illogic of the story's main plot element. The son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back in time to prevent The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenneger) from killing the waitress who's son would lead the resistance against the machines in the year 2029. Now you can only take the 'chicken or the egg' argument so far. Even Sarah Connor realized this by the end of the story when she said it made her head hurt. As laid out, this story couldn't have happened, and yet it stands as one of the most memorable sci-fi flicks of all time.And that's OK. I give the picture high marks for it's relentless pace and the innovative ways the Cyberdine System Model 101 (that would be Arnold) found to hunt down it's quarry. By today's technology and special effects, the picture appears somewhat dated, as does Ridley Scott's ""Alien"", but that can't be helped any more than the constraints on an earlier era's ""War of the Worlds"" (1953) or ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" (1951). Even the skeletal half-Terminator of the film's finale, which clearly screamed Harryhausen, managed to effectively engage this viewer in the desperate struggle for survival and victory. This adventure wouldn't be over until that single red eye went dark, not in a blaze of glory, but in the suffocating gray defeat of all it's hunter-killer instinct.Hard to say which Sarah Connor I prefer - the buffed and muscular Linda Hamilton of the sequel, or the soft and indecisive, almost clueless Sarah of the original. Therein lies the opportunity for the growth of the character over the course of the story arc. One needs to follow it through.One thing I realized today though, and it took twenty five years to come to it, but the title of this film is ""The Terminator"". I think when you're dealing with someone as huge as 'Mr. Universe' and 'Mr. Olympia' on the world bodybuilding stage, there's no room for defining the protagonist with the article 'The'. In my book, this film will always be ""Terminator"".",The Terminator
5,gavin6942,The Beginning of an Incredible Franchise,7,12 September 2010,"In the year 2029, the robots have taken over but are losing the war... and they have devised a plan: send a robot back to the past to destroy the mother of the human leader, thus causing him never to be born. Unfortunately for the evil robots, human Kyle Reese has been sent back, too.While I think the sequel is flatly better, and I do not feel this film deserves to be in the top 250 of all time, it is a good film by all accounts. Action, good plot, decent acting... horror icons Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, and Dick Miller are all here. A young Bill Paxton even shows up.James Cameron has had an amazing career, and this was an early triumph. Even if he walked away from the franchise after the first film (a great science fiction tale), he would have kicked off an amazing series and a television show. With consistently strong writing, plot and continuity, we have to thank Cameron.",The Terminator
6,lee_eisenberg,"Both ""Terminator"" movies will always be back.",7,13 October 2005,"Okay, so ""The Terminator"" wasn't any kind of masterpiece. But it did have an interesting premise, that a machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) gets sent back in time to kill the mother of the future resistance leader. Admittedly, it seems a little far-fetched that Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) only has this boy because Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) gets sent back in time to protect her. But it's just a movie, people! True, if Ah-nuld had murdered the mother, then there never would have been a resistance leader to begin with, and the government wouldn't have seen any reason to send him back in time. But you can't dwell on that stuff. Just sit back and watch the action. As it is, I actually liked ""T2"" better, mainly because the mother was a bad-ass in that one.",The Terminator
7,jboothmillard,The Terminator,10,18 March 2005,"There are those who believe in fate, and the smallest decisions and actions could determine a person's whole future, well imagine what would happen if the future came to you, a fantastically inventive idea from director James Cameron (Aliens, Titanic). It is 1984, and from a flash comes the human looking machine (cyborg) from the future, 2029, called the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). This machine is on a mission to kill a woman who is key to what could help the future, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), and the only man she can count on who knows most about this future is Kyle Reese (Michael Beihn), who also came from it. He tells her all about the Terminator, the war (Judgement Day) and why it is important she lives. She is the mother of the man who is the saviour for the human race, John Connor. Also starring Paul Winfield as Lieutenant Ed Traxler, Aliens' Lance Henriksen as Detective Hal Vukovich, Bess Motta as Ginger Ventura, Earl Boen as Dr. Peter Silberman, Rick Rossovich as Matt Buchanan and Dick Miller as Pawnshop Clerk. The film is made up of many gripping chases, fantastic gory effects (as the Terminator loses his flesh in his hunt, and it is a low budget film!) and fantastic direction from Cameron. The excellent sequel followed in 1991. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Terminator (Villain) was number 22 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""I'll be back.""), it was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 98 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",The Terminator
8,ccthemovieman-1,Surprise! Arnold Plays The Villain,8,10 June 2006,"Here's another film from the '80s that is reaching ""classic"" status. Unlike some of the other popular movies of its day, this one had two sequels that both were successful, particularly the second. In retrospect, what makes this ""Terminator"" different is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain, not the hero, as he was in the other Terminator movies.Here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the ""good guys."" The now famous phrase by Arnold, ""I'll be back."" comes from this film. Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.Played mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains.",The Terminator
9,rmax304823,You'll find this humerus.....,6,6 April 2006,"What's worse than an ordinary action picture? Hardly anything, except maybe a really bad slasher movie. In an action picture we see a fireball explode in slow motion while in the foreground an actor dives towards the camera. A speeding car hits an obstacle and does a grand jetee. Everyone's hand grips an ugly gun. The disparate hero and heroine finally fall for one another and close the deal between blood baths. The musical score pounds us into excruciating insensibility. A pinned hand gropes for a weapon. The script is sparsely sprinkled with wisecracks to the wise.""The Terminator"" has all of these clichés and more, and yet, the gol danged thing hangs together. It's as if you'd taken all your leftovers, thrown them into a pot, shaken some lesser-used seasoning onto it, cooked it, and hoped for the best. It isn't that there's very much distinctive about the film, except maybe its all-gray pallet and the overall darkness. Of course it's easier to shoot in LA at night when the city is empty of all human tissue. If you want to make a movie about the last person on earth, shoot it in downtown LA on a weekend. Come to think of it, they already have -- ""The Omega Man."" It's not possible to explain the success of this flick. The only thing you can say is that it succeeds on its own terms. It has no moral, like ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" no resonance beyond its violence. If the acting is good enough that's largely because so little is called for. The best performance is given by the two cops. Arnold comes in a close second. His best moments come when he is not on screen but has been replaced by a completely metallic skeletal cyborg that is blown to bits -- an ear here, a humerus there -- until he is finally extinguished by this gigantic duck press. That's not to put down Linda Hamilton. She is plump lipped, hair blown, and sexy. She was my supporting player in another film, one that I think everyone would agree is a masterpiece of cinematic high art, a nonpareil of poetics, and an unforgettable action drama in itself -- ""King Kong Lives."" Michael Biene falls a bit short of the bar set by Linda Hamilton.But what does any of that matter? You can watch the thing repeatedly. It's almost hypnotic.",The Terminator
10,Tweekums,An '80s sci-fi classic,9,23 August 2015,"In the year 2029 mankind has been virtually wiped out by intelligent machines but humanity is fighting back under the leadership of John Connor. It is too late for the machines to defeat him so they send a cyborg killer, a Terminator, back to 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah Connor, before he is even conceived! John couldn't stop this plan so he sends his closest friend, Kyle Reese, back to protect her. Sarah is just an ordinary young woman who has no idea what is about to happen to her; the first she knows that something strange is happening is when two other women, also named Sarah Connor, are reported brutally murdered. It looks as if she will be next but Kyle rescues her just in time she isn't safe though; the Terminator is virtually indestructible and it has only one mission; to kill her.It is hard to believe that this film is now thirty years old; apart from the '80s 'big hair' it has hardly dated. The plot is relatively straightforward and little time is wasted on unnecessary twists. Arnold Schwarzenegger understandably dominates as the merciless Terminator; he may be a character of few words but those he does say have become iconic; 'I'll be back' has become his catchphrase thanks to him saying it once in this film. Linda Hamilton does a fine job as the ordinary woman, Sarah Connor, we can believe that despite her obvious vulnerability she has an inner strength. Michael Biehn is also good, playing Kyle, a tough but very human character. Director James Cameron gets the action started early on and it doesn't let up until the end. The action is fairly violent, for the most part it doesn't dwell on injuries but there are still a few shocking moments as innocent people are gunned down. Overall I'd say that this is a great film that stands multiple viewings; I know a lot of people prefer the second instalment in this franchise but for me this is the best.",The Terminator

Both of whom have to find a way to escape from the invincible Terminator who will stop at nothing to chase her .Exhilarating and nail-biting original film based on a story by Harlan Ellison and script by Gale Anne Hurd, that caused a famous and boxoffice franchise. Adding a prolonged climatic final sequence full of noisy action and violence that is considered to be one of the best of film story. Here Arnie is a cold-bloded cyborg who will stop at nothing to get his target : Kill Sarah Connor, he utters one now popular line : I'll be back, that has passed into movie legend . This is one of the brightest and better films action films of the Eighties. Arnold Swarzzeneger
dominates the movie in a stiff and wooden action, in Mr T style. There are nice secondaries providing brief interpretations as Paul Winfield, Lance Henricksen, Rick Rossovich, Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, Dick Miller, among others. It packs a repetitive musical score by synthesizer and composed by Brad Fievel, including the classic leit motif. As well as adequate and atmospheric cinematography.

12,BA_Harrison,A landmark moment in sci-fi/action cinema.,10,8 November 2011,"A big, bad-ass cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels back in time to try and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), mother of the man who will—in forty years time—lead the human race to victory in a war against computers. Only one man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier from the future, can help her her to stay alive...The Terminator, the film that rocketed James Cameron to A-list director status, and gave Arnie his most iconic role (the one which saw him coin his catchphrase ""I'll be back""), is such an accomplished piece of action/sci-fi in almost every department that, even after 25 years and many, many viewings later, it never fails to impress me.A top notch cast (which also includes Cameron regulars Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton), excellent Stan Winston effects, and a terrific score by Brad Fiedel, combined with Cameron's flawless handling of his material and Schwarzenegger's suitably mechanical performance, all adds up to one of the finest movies ever made. Whereas many time-travel tales invite the viewer to search for paradoxes, I find that this film moves at such a cracking pace and delivers all the adrenaline-pumping action I'm after, that I never stop to worry about such trifling matters.",The Terminator
13,moonspinner55,"Seems a bit cheapjack now, and with a crass sense of humor",5,29 June 2003,"Director James Cameron stages a shoot-out and a freeway chase with aplomb, but his quieter moments aren't as smooth, and his attempts at visual humor are a little heavy(heavier still are some of the jokes in the script, which wobble at best). But Arnold Schwarzenegger found his niche here, playing a villain without a heart, an expressionless and bloodthirsty machine, and it's easy to see why this transformed his career: he's a natural at playing the bad guy(which is why ""Terminator 2"" was such a disappointment, it tried to reconfigure the odds back in Arnold's favor). Linda Hamilton is also terrific as a waitress whom Arnold wants dead. The sci-fi angle that frames the story feels pulpy(and looks pretty tacky to boot), but the action propels you along almost against your better judgment. **1/2 from ****",The Terminator
14,paul_haakonsen,This time he actually did come back...,8,21 January 2016,"Being a pre-teen back in 1984, it was inevitable not to get familiar with all the action movies of the 1980's. And the 1984 ""The Terminator"" starring none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger definitely was one of the biggest action movies of the mid-Eighties.I am very sure that everyone is familiar with the ""Terminator"" franchise and the plans of Skynet. But for those of you not yet familiar with the franchise, this 1984 movie, which started it all, is about a cyborg (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent from 2029 back in time to 1984 where his mission is to terminate Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines. But the humans of 2029 has managed to send back a single soldier (played by Michael Biehn) to prevent this from happening.There, essentially the entire story wrapped up with a handful of words. Despite its simplicity, then there are layers underneath the storyline which adds lots of flavor and detail to the story and the universe of the ""Terminator"" franchise. Things which will come to be realized and utilized in the later movies.For a 1984 action movie then ""The Terminator"" was just off the charts. It had great special effects, heaps of non-stop action, and best of all it had Schwarzenegger. It has all the ingredients that a good action movie need in order to be successful. And you must agree that the ""Terminator"" franchise has been successful throughout the years since 1984.Director James Cameron does what he does best here, and that is putting together a riveting action movie that grabs the audience by the you-know-whats and doesn't let go before the end credits start rolling. James Cameron really has a talent for memorable action movies.The cast in ""The Terminator"" also really had a lot of credit due for the success of the movie. Anything that Arnold Schwarzenegger touched in the mid-Eighties was bound to be an action success. And alongside him in this 1984 movie stood Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, both of whom put on equally good performances and held the level of Schwarzenegger formidably.""The Terminator"" is one of those types of action movies that never grow old. Sure certain effects are hopelessly outdated by what Hollywood dish out today, but they were really great back in 1984. And the effects do serve their purpose well enough, especially given that this movie is driven by a mixture of story, character and effects.Lots of action and lots of one-liners, ""The Terminator"" is an entertaining movie that is well-worth spending 107 minutes on watching.",The Terminator
15,Quinoa1984,"still an action movie classic, or a 'Tech-Noir' if you will",10,30 April 2000,"The Terminator - ripped from the pages of Harlan Ellison (literally ripped-off at first until a lawsuit came around for screen credit) and out of the imagination of James Cameron, it's an action movie that MOVES, fast, after a 20 minute set-up with only little bits to pause and reflect or give exposition or have a quintessential love scene. It's also the reason that Arnold Schwarzenegger got work for so many years after as a star, with a performance that oddly enough features only a handful of lines of dialog. One wonders today the T-800, Cyberdine model 101, is still (Anton Chigurh be damned) the true quiet-killer in modern cinema.The set-up is simple, so simple a child or senile old person can watch and know what's going on: Kyle Reese, soldier, sent back over 40 years into the past to stop the T-800 from killing Sarah Conner, mother of the resistance-against-the-machines leader John. That's about it. There's some more, of course, including a glimpse into the future (the term ""Tecnh-Noir"" is most apt even with the rampant violence throughout), but mostly it's a chase movie, a cat-and-mouse game where the lines are drawn straight and from there on in James Cameron propells the characters and action down without a mark missed. It's the kind of movie that if you really like it the first time you'll rewatch it whenever it's on TV and love it more.

Director Cameron's ""The Terminator"" perfectly captures the look, and feel, of Los Angeles in the mid-1980s. Cameron's ability to thrillingly direct is the film's greatest strength; he mesmerizes. Mr. Biehn and Ms. Hamilton are a great hero team. Mr. Schwarzenegger is much more of a special effect than an actor, which means he is perfect in this movie. You're always going to have ""flaws"" in this type of film; though, note, the ""time paradox"" problem is explained by a quick reference to possible future realities (plural).

The plot is one immense paradox and you either love or hate the ultra-apocalyptic and sadistic theme of this film. But, even when you completely loathe the premise, you'll still always have to admit that The Terminator is one of the most imaginative scripts ever written. Dig this: the futuristic rulers of the world anno 2029 send back a robot in time, to the year 1984, with only one goal. Kill the mother of the great future freedom fighter before he's even born. And the father of this great hero is a soldier, sent after the cyborg, to prevent him from fulfilling his mission. If this isn't ingenious, nothing is! And, above this, The Terminator is a very diverse film as well. It's a shocking thriller (the hunt for Sarah Connor) as well as a dared, intense drama (the huge load of innocent victims). And with compelling horror moments as well! The film is purely brilliant and Arnold finally gets to play the role he was born for.

18,sunwarrior13,A Major Influence In Future Sci-Fi And Action Films,10,21 October 2012,"The Terminator is a science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, co-written by Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd and William Wisher Jr. and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. Schwarzenegger plays the Terminator, a cyborg assassin sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, played by Hamilton. Biehn plays Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future sent back in time to protect Sarah.Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of co-writer/director James Cameron and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger.Kyle Reese is a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor, the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator, a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructible cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two ""Sarah Connors"" who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article.It is a blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso movie-making, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story.This is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. But don't overlook the contributions of Linda Hamilton, who more than holds her own as the Terminator's would-be victim, Sarah Connor that helps create a new generation of rugged, clear-thinking female action stars. It's surprising how well this film holds up, and how its minimalist, malevolent violence is actually way scarier than that of its far more expensive, more effects-laden sequel.Added to that,with its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why it continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.",The Terminator

20,hitchcockthelegend,I can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him - and me.,9,7 May 2015,"It's funny really, writing a review for The Terminator these days just feels a little pointless, I mean anyone who wanted to see it would have done so already. In truth the effects work is a little creaky now but that doesn't matter, they were awesome in 1984. It's a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics. It's place in the pantheon of science fiction films is assured, its influence on the genre undoubted, while the lead cast members cemented themselves in the sci-fi hall of fame.No more needs to be said really, The Terminator is a kinetic live action comic book of a movie, classy movie making, paced to precision and featuring a story that's brilliantly complex and utterly compelling. 9/10",The Terminator
21,Theo Robertson,Classic Independent Film,10,15 February 2002,"There`s not much unsaid about THE TERMINATOR since everyone`s mentioned it being the best genre film of the 80`s though no one seems to have spotted a couple of minor plot holes... 1 ) Reese mention`s he was born after the holocaust , but he`s able to drive a car no problem. Seems the machines of the future will still allow humans driving lessons . That`s kind of them 2 ) Reese has his hands cuffed behind his back. Even if he gets the keys for the handcuffs how is he able to unlock them on his own ?But apart from that there`s little to criticize. Arnie has never given a better performance , Michael Biehn comes across very well as the all American hero and amazingly never became a major Hollywood star , and James Cameron shows what can be done on a relatively small budget. Does anyone feel that Cameron should have stuck to this type of film making ?",The Terminator
22,Hey_Sweden,A career highlight for Cameron and Schwarzenegger.,10,3 November 2012,"Filmmaker James Cameron had already showed a real style and vision when working for Roger Corman's special effects and art department, also learning well how to shoot fast and on a low budget. Here his talent and experience paid off with this breakthrough film, truly a model action picture with its unflagging pace and intensity level. It moves forward quite well while also remaining coherent, telling an interesting story that owes a debt to not only the works of Harlan Ellison, as is credited at the end, but Michael Crichtons' ""Westworld"". Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a credible star performance as the title character, a cyborg sent to 1984 from the future by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. It wants to ensure that its primary human enemy, a man named John Connor, is never born, so the terminator is sent back in time to assassinate his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Fortunately, a protector for Sarah is also sent back, a sensitive soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). Reese will have his work cut out for him not only trying to keep Sarah alive, but convincing her that his wild sounding story is indeed reality. ""The Terminator"" has incredible atmosphere, in both its present and future scenes, and has some wonderful eye popping visuals, not to mention fantastic special effects work by Stan Winston. Brad Fiedel's music score is catchy and iconic, but sounds even more haunting and effective when it's done as a simple piano melody. The editing (by Mark Goldblatt), art direction (by George Costello), and cinematography (by Adam Greenberg) are all first rate. The movie does date itself in certain ways (fashion styles and music), but that merely adds to the appeal in this viewers' humble opinion. It's also not wall to wall action, as it takes some breathers here and there, and is really quite touching in some of its quieter moments. The casting is spot on all the way down the line. Schwarzenegger is perfect as the relentless killing machine, especially as the role doesn't require a lot of dialogue, the under-rated Biehn does a nice job of selling his character and the material, and appealing Hamilton does a fine job with her character arc as Sarah changes from being kind of a mousy person to being more take-charge. The excellent supporting cast features such reliable people as Lance Henriksen (who's a hoot), Paul Winfield, Rick Rossovich, and Earl Boen, and there are some wonderful bits for Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, and Dick Miller. Cameron and co-writer / producer Gale Anne Hurd inject the film with a decent dose of humour (such as the terminator cycling through various possible responses to a question) that never becomes too prevalent. ""The Terminator"" is simply one of the best films of its kind, and its impact on pop culture (including Arnolds' best known cinematic one-liner of them all) is undeniable. A must see for sci-fi and action lovers. Followed by three sequels and the 'Sarah Connor Chronicles' TV series. 10 out of 10.",The Terminator
23,preppy-3,One of the best sci-fi action films ever made,8,24 February 2006,"In 2026 machines have taken over and are killing mankind--but one man is beating them. A cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent from the future to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)-the mother of that man. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) also goes back to prevent him from killing her.Now legendary science fiction action film is every bit as good as its reputation. It moves quickly and is full of action and violence almost virtually nonstop. There are plenty of exciting high speed car chases and a knockout sequence when Arnie basically decimates an entire police station--and everyone in it. The special effects are impressive especially considering this was a low-budget film. The plot is intelligent and intricate--it treats its audience with respect. There are some amusing things that date this--the VERY 80s music soundtrack, the Tech Noir club (which has a $4.50 cover charge) and hysterically bad clothes.The acting isn't that good. Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as a robot and Biehn walks through his role. Only Hamilton gives a good performance--but who watches this for the acting? Also there are some familiar faces in small roles--Bill Paxton (as a punk); Dick Miller (the gun store owner); Rick Rossovich (as a doomed boyfriend) and Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen as police officers. Also this is the film that gave Arnie his infamous ""I'll be back"" line.This movie has its lulls--it does come to a screeching halt when Reese and Connor get to know each other (even though that sequence IS necessary) and it does have to take time out to explain things. Still this is an exciting, violent movie well worth catching. This rightfully put director James Cameron on the map.Best line: ""You're terminated f**ker!""",The Terminator

This is not an original Sci-Fi scenario but it is one ready made for the Reagan era (SDI) and our periodic pondering of industrial and technological ""advancements"".This was a modest budget sleeper that awakened movie goers with its dark palette of stylized violence and intense, non-stop action and pacing. It revved them up with a screen filled with loud machines, dark cityscapes, seedy motels, and an air of impending doom. The intensity only pauses long enough for the virgin Father (a modern twist) to plant the seed of the ""Savior"".This has all the elements of a classic Sci-Fi welded on to a Horror movie chassis that moves like a roller-coaster. It is intelligent and intense, violent with sensitivity, and is humorous and entertaining. This movie was the beginning of a ""new wave"" and its style and conceits would become classic, unlike that 80""s synth soundtrack that is as dated as Disco.

A genuine 100% classic.",9,19 December 2007,"The Terminator starts in the future post apocalyptic year of 2029 where the machine has taken complete control & are engaging in a war intent on wiping mankind out, after realising they have lost the war against mankind the machines send a T-800 cybernetic terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 Los Angeles where it is programmed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the mother of the leader of the resistance who in the future will defeat the machines. At the same time the resistance is able to send back a protector for Sarah, a soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) in an attempt to prevent her termination by the killer cyborg. The streets of Los Angeles become the fighting ground for the very future of humanity as Sarah must survive or all hope for mankind will be lost...This English American co-production was co-written & directed by James Cameron & has gone on to become widely acknowledged as just about the best sci-fi action film of the 80's & maybe even to this point it hasn't been bettered, it's an iconic film with many moments that have become part of pop culture & the amount of killer robot flicks that have followed is also a testament to it's popularity & influence. The script by Cameron & producer Gale Ann Hurd is a terrific action packed thoughtful & intelligent sci-fi thriller, it has a great pace about it with plenty of car chases, shoot-outs, fights & futuristic battle scenes to satisfy most action junkies & plenty of robots, an extremely well thought out time travel story that makes perfect sense & an underlying message about putting too much faith in machines & computers in an era when the modern PC hadn't even been invented & I guess Cameron just saw the way things were going. There's so much to enjoy here & so little to not not like, from exciting action set-pieces set both in the present & the future, some great special effects that hold up pretty well even today, a really good solid sci-fi story which is well thought out & easy to pick up & understand while still managing to be gripping & a really fast pace which simply doesn't allow the viewer to become bored although there's still enough meaningful character development when needed for you to care for them & what happens to them. An almost perfect film & an absolute classic of the genre or indeed any genre, one of the best films ever made. Period.Director Cameron has since gone on to become one of the biggest director's in Hollywood with a string of huge films like Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), True Lies (1994) the the most successful film ever made to date Titanic (1997) while The Terminator was his second full length feature film after the OK horror sequel Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981) & he does a great job of making his small budget go far. From the action scenes to the special effects The Terminator is an impressive film even today, OK some of the stop motion terminator effects aren't the best they still at least look alright. The film is very violent with lots of gun-play, there's also some gore as the terminator has to get rid of his damaged eye by inserting a scalpel into it & plucking it out, he also has to slice his arm open to repair some mechanics.With a supposed budget of about $6,400,000 this didn't have a particularly big budget but the film doesn't suffer as there's still more car chases, shoot-outs, special effects & fights than a lot of much higher budgeted Hollywood stuff from the time. The music is great, the effects are good, it's well made & the production values are high. The acting is very good all round, apparently only paid $75,000 Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role & he gets to say his trademark 'Ill be back' for the first time on screen.The Terminator is a solid gold 100% classic & it's as simple & straight forward as that. There quite simply isn't anything that I don't like about this film, definitely recommended. Followed by the equally as brilliant Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the not so brilliant but still enjoyable Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2008) while a third sequel Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins (2009) is apparently in production.",The Terminator
26,zardoz-13,The First Major Cinematic Cyborg Thriller of Them All!!!,8,23 May 2009,"""Piranha 2: The Spawning"" director James Cameron scored his first major cinematic hit with ""The Terminator,"" a gritty, on-the-run, rough-hewn, low-budget science fiction actioneer about time travel with a curious twist. Body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger virtually guaranteed that this 107 minute exercise in murder and mayhem would be a blockbuster with his villainous, straight-faced portrayal of a relentless cyborg that will allow nothing to stand between its programmed objective of executing a woman, Sarah Connor, in the past. The chief science fiction element in Cameron's film is the use of predestination paradox where it appears the history is being altered, when in fact, it is really being fulfilled. Cameron rehashed much of the ""Terminator"" action in the sequel, but he made the Schwarzenegger more sympathetic by having him serve as young John Connor's bodyguard. Ironically, this $6-million plus movie wasn't that original because cyborg characters have been around in fantasy literature as early as Edgar Allan Poe. Nevertheless, ""The Terminator"" put cyborgs on the map more than ""The Six-Million Dollar Man"" and eventually inspired the ""Robocop"" franchise.""The Terminator"" opens in Los Angeles in 2029 A.D., at night while enemy Hunter Killer hovercraft prowl the post-apocalyptic rubble of the city for human prey. Heavy combat vehicles with massive treads on their wheels crush hundreds of human skulls into powder while human survivors exchange fire with skeletal metal terminators with fiery red eyes. A preamble of sorts comes up and sets the scene: The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here in our present . . . tonight. The actual story unfolds at 1:52 AM when a garbage truck driver watches crackling blue plasma-type waves envelope him and his vehicle.A garbage truck operator is emptying trash bins when a plasma-like web of jagged blue lighting bolts envelopes his vehicle and shuts off the vehicle's power. He flees when the T-101 Terminator assassin (Arnold Schwarzenegger) appears naked out of nowhere. Skynet has sent the T-101 from the future back to the year 1984 to kill the mother of resistance leader John Connor. The naked t-101 saunters up to a trio of punks at the Griffith Park Observatory overlooking Los Angeles. An obnoxious, blue-haired punk (Bill Paxton of ""Aliens"" and ""Twister"") and his friend (veteran heavy Brian Thompson of ""Sudden Impact"" and ""Cobra"") ridicule T-101. The Terminator kills both of them while the third strips off his clothing. Meanwhile, elsewhere in L.A., another naked man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn of ""The Rock"") materializes from the future. He steals a homeless man's pants, evades the L.A.P.D., and breaks into a clothing store, steals Nike sneakers and a trench coat. Whereas the T-101 wants to kill Sarah, Kyle wants to save her! Not surprisingly, young Sarah Connor doesn't have a clue that anybody yearns to either murder her or save her life.Sarah works at a fast-food restaurant. The T-101 finds three Sarah Connors in the L.A. phone book and kills the first two and then invades Sarah's apartment and kills her roommate Ginger and Matt (Rick Rossovich of ""Top Gun"") her boyfriend. Eventually, Sarah discovers what is happening and holes up at a night club called Tech Noir where the T-101 tracks her down. Kyle Reese rescues Sarah and they flee, but the L.A.P.D. capture them and Reese has to cough up his far-fetched story to a by pompous psychologist Dr. Peter Silberman (Earl Boen of ""Alien Nation"") who doesn't believe a syllable of Reese's saga. Silberman diagnoses Reese as suffering from paranoid delusions and boasts that he make a career out of analyzing the guy's stories. During Reese's interrogation scene at police headquarters with Silberman, Cameron and co-writers Gale Ann Hurd and an uncredited William Wisher, Jr., provide audiences with crucial expository information about Skynet and the war with the cyborgs that seek to annihilate mankind.The bulk of ""The Terminator"" concerns the T-101's tireless efforts to kill Sarah while Reese struggles to lead her to safety. During their flight, Reese and Sarah become romantically involved and Reese gets Sarah pregnant with future resistance leader John Connor. Talk about twisted time travel?! Cameron intersperses a flashback to the future where a T-101 (Schwarzenegger's pal Franco Columbu of ""Beretta's Island"") invades a resistance bunker and goes on a murderous rampage before he is eliminated. Throughout the blazing action sequences, Cameron gradually strips the T-101 down to its alloyed metal endoskeleton. Reese explains to Silberman that a Terminator is a cyborg, half-man, and half-machine that will never stop until it kills Sarah. Everybody at the police station regards Reese as a fruit cake with his unbelievable story until the T-101 shows up with an arsenal of weapons and shoots up the premises, killing at least 17 cops. Reese and Sarah escape, hid out in a motel where they build pipe bombs, but the resourceful T-101 finds Sarah's mother, kills her off-screen, and imitates her so that it can learn Sarah's whereabouts. Another ramped up chase ensues with the T-101 caught in a blazing 18-wheeler. The fire scorches its entire body in the last 15 minutes so that all that remains is the skeleton. Reese dies blowing the skeleton in two. The torso of the T-101 continues to stalk Sarah until she crushes it in a tool manufacturing factory so that only the hand and forearm, which appears in the sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" James Cameron has more road trip action in this thriller than actual science fiction, but the action-packed scenes more than deliver their quota of thrills and chills. One of the earliest scenes in a pawnshop has the T-101 gathering an arsenal of hardware from an unsuspecting clerk (Dick Miller) and then killing him instead of paying for it. The ""I'll be back"" scene at the police station massacre is probably the best scene in this supercharged little spine-tingler.",The Terminator
27,grantss,Entertaining sci-fi action-drama,7,10 May 2014,"Entertaining sci-fi action-drama.Revolutionary special effects are what makes this movie special. The effects, from 1984, are still good even by today's standards. The plot is not bad either. Unlike most of James Cameron's movies, which are purely style over substance (yes, I'm thinking of Titanic and Avatar in particular), this movie has a decent plot. Not entirely watertight, but it exists and is reasonably coherent and plausible and not merely a medium for linking action scenes.Though he had done the two Conan movies before this, it is this movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star. Not there for his acting abilities, or linguistic skill, he was every bit the action figure (not quite action hero...). Linda Hamilton was solid in her role (though her hair style shows this movie was made in the 80s...). Michael Biehn was OK, though sometimes came off as too over-the-top in his performance.",The Terminator
28,Boba_Fett1138,It's already a classic!,8,7 January 2006,"I imaging that in 50 years from now, or even more, people will still be watching this movie withs lots of joy and respect. Even though the movie its look is already outdated, it still is a movie that speaks to the imagination and is both tense and spectacular to watch. ""The Terminator"" is one of those movies everyone should have seen at least once in his or hers life.What makes ""The Terminator"" already such a classic today is a combination of certain factors. Of course the title character 'The Terminator' played by Arnold Schwarzenegger is perhaps the biggest reason. He doesn't have to speak any lines to make a lasting impression. His presences and looks is more than enough to make his character a classic one. Another element is the fantastic imaginative futuristic story and concept, that is made totally believable thanks to the professionality of both cast and crew. Action-director James Cameron uplifts the movie with some dynamic action sequences and shootouts, despite the movie its fairly low-budget.Lets be fair, ""The Terminator"" is a B-movie. The special effects are below average, even for 1984 standards, the actors are B-stars (Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen, who I both really like as actors by the way, are the biggest indication of this.) and the story is of course incredibly B-movie like once you start thinking about it. The movie however is really uplifted by mainly the directing from James Cameron and the presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger. It gives the movie both a sense of reality and tension as well as making it spectacular and action filled.The movie has '80's written all over it. The clothes, the hair, and the ultimate '80's music and musical score by Brad Fiedel, it's all terribly '80's like which makes this movie perhaps a bit more outdated than it is.Unfortunately the movie also has some (unesacary) slow moments toward the ending of the movie. It doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie which is fast paced and action packed. I also was never a big fan of the ending. Once Arnie seizes to be 'The Terminator' it's not as tense and scary anymore.Other than that, this is a fantastic and already classic science-fiction/action movie with thriller elements in it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Terminator
29,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Excellent, holds up unbelievably well",9,1 December 2008,"There are a lot of marvelous reasons to love this. What exactly they are may vary, but I can give you my suggestions for a couple: It mixes a bleak, dystopian future vision with breathtaking, mind-blowing action(and without becoming a film that can't inspire you to think, and that goes for others done by the man who helmed this), and does so extremely well. It is blessed with the enthusiastic and perfectionistic direction of James Cameron, and it shows. The pacing is utterly impeccable. I could not tell you how many times I've watched this. The plot and science fiction are both fantastic, well-thought out, and hold up to thorough scrutiny, I've yet to find a genuine problem in them. The concept is terrifying, smart and thrilling. It all unfolds rather well. The script in general is spectacularly well-done. This never runs out of steam, and in spite of intensity, it doesn't overwhelm, either. All three of the listed genres are masterfully achieved here, and I would agree with anyone suggesting that ""horror"" should be mentioned, as well. The acting is magnificent, the performances are spot-on. Not sure I'd say that there are any exceptions to that. I became a fan of Biehn from viewing this. Schwarzenegger does pretty darn amazing. Henriksen is a lot of fun to watch, intentionally so. Lines are well-written and equally well-delivered. The score is synthesized and is a perfect fit. The music, clothes and special effects(which are almost invariably still incredible) are the only aspects of this that date it any. The guns are tremendously well chosen and handled(read the Trivia to see Arnie's efforts in that area). There is violence and some relatively disturbing sights in this, as well as a little sexuality/nudity, and a moderate amount of language, that can get strong. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the notion of an exciting movie with gun-fights, car-chases, a dark tone, well-done sci-fi, that just might provide food for thought, if you go in looking for that. 9/10",The Terminator

A soldier from the future is sent via energy field to protect her because her life is important to the survival of the future John Connor. Extremely tense action particularly when it appears that the Terminator is virtually unstoppable. This makes room for interesting elements such as his ability to manipulate. James Cameron does an excellent job at staging the action as well as creating a convincing robotic structure. Arnold Schwarzenegger is overwhelming and intimidating as the cyborg whose defeat arrives when Connor uses the obvious against him. Michael Biehn is pushed to his physical limits as the soldier who is believed to be insane. Sarah is played by Linda Hamilton confused regarding a fate she didn't ask for. Lance Henriksen is unfortunately underused as a detective who could have provided an interesting investigating subplot. Paul Winfield plays another police official questioning Sarah Connor.

He must find Sarah before the Terminator can carry out it's mission.....What's left to say about the film that hasn't been said. It defined two marvellous careers, created maybe the best catchphrase ever committed to celluloid, and all this thanks to a dream that Cameron had (James, not David).Its a simple premise, executed brilliantly and imitated many times since. Any direct to video release featuring the word Robot or Cyborg for the following fifteen years after 1984, either homaged or ripped off the movie.Schwarzenegger is perfect, it's his greatest role, and although T2 is the better movie, Arnold as the villain makes it more urgent than its sequel. You believe he's unstoppable, and although you've seen the movie dozens of times, that scene where the Terminator finally spots Connor in the Tech-Noir, it still chills.Yes,mothers are many plot holes and flaws, but for heavens sake, its a movie about a Cyborg being sent back in time to kill the mother of an unborn boy, and its wonderful.It also proves again the theory that 1984 was the best year ever for movies.",The Terminator

His prey, Sarah Connor played very well by Linda Hamilton.  The story is good and there is lots of action and excitement.  This one goes pretty quick too, unlike the second one which has places in it that drags a bit.  Of course it makes up for the slow parts by having better effects than this one.  This one has many memorable scenes, the most memorable being the Terminator's attack on the police station.  There are a couple of Cameron staples here as Michael Biehan and Lance Henrikson are in it.  They appear in other Cameron movies as well.  Bill Paxton even has a small role in this one.

I heard the idea came from and old Outer Limits episode, from the early 60's, starring Lenord Neymod (Spock) as the robot.

And yet, one of his best movies works strictly on economy. ""The Terminator"" takes the B-movie premise of a killer robot stalking a young woman and infuses it with imagination. It's a terrific script that takes time travel, a love story and a nightmarish vision of the future and weaves it all into something exciting. You can see the constraints of the budget in the DIY effects, but the real joys of this movie lie in its flawless pacing and brutal efficiency.

This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity. One is heavily muscular; the other man, slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named ""Sarah Connor"", using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last Sarah Connor, he is stopped by the other man, Kyle Reese who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage, Reese explains that the man hunting Sarah is actually a cyborg assassin called a ""Terminator"", built by Skynet, an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future, Reese explains, Skynet gained self-awareness, initiated a global takeover of military hardware, and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. John Connor, Sarah's son, rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign, the human resistance was on the verge of victory; in a last-ditch effort, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John was born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. Reese volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect Sarah; after his use of the time transportation equipment, it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain, has no emotions, and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah, the effects are very 80's, but for the time and even to this day, I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything: action, romance, horror, sci-fi, and even some dark humor. The reason why Arnold's ""I'll be back"" is so famous is not just because of his accent, but because you knew that something bad was coming. Kyle Reese's ""Come with me if you want to live"" is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator, I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed, if you are, get a CAT scan.10/10",The Terminator
39,MovieAddict2016,The best of the best in its genre...,10,5 June 2003,"Rarely has a film so frightened an audience as ""The Terminator."" After its release in 1984, the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner broke box office records, and gave audiences something more to fear. Through the years, there have been stories of nature's beasts, of creatures from another world, and so on and so forth. ""Jaws"" was terrifying because it seemed so possible. And if ""Jaws"" is terrifying, ""The Terminator"" is horrific. The realization of this hit-man machine dawned on everyone watching the film. In a time of exceeding technology, how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like ""The Terminator."" In ""The Terminator,"" Arnold plays a cyborg, Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, whatever that means. He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soon-to-be-mother of the future world leader, John Connor (who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising). If Connor is killed, then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future, and they will triumph. This would be pretty bad. So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time, to help save his mother. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tells Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) about the machine that is trying to kill her. ""It can't be bargained with, it can't feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead!"" Talk about a bad day.The Terminator hunts them down time after time, including the famous police station scene, where Arnie says, ""I'll be back,"" and returns moments later, crashing through the wall in a car. He then takes on a whole squad of cops, but don't worry, Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed.There are countless classic scenes in ""The Terminator."" You will see them spoofed your entire life. From the image of the Terminator, to the lines they speak, to the scenes they act out. Everything is spoofed. And the film is worthy of its fame.On the special edition ""T2"" DVD (the second one), there is an on-set documentary for the making of the ""Terminator 2"" 3-D ride at Universal Studios. As the camera moves around, it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene. Some guy suggests something else, and Cameron gets a tone. ""No, no, that won't work. You do it like this - we come off here, he walks around..."" etc. The point is, he's a perfectionist, and a demanding director. Some directors are a bit too easy, and don't really care where their films are going. But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants, and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done. And it shows in his work. It's hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film. And it's even harder to find plot holes.Some people say ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" is better than the original. It's hard to choose, because the two films are very different. I view ""The Terminator"" as more of a deep, intellectually-consuming, dark thriller. I view ""Judgment Day"" as an action film, with a more or less recycled plot. (The plot is still good, but it's still the same, too.) It's hard to choose a favorite because they are so different. On ""T2"" the budget is ten times larger, probably even more than that. But if you want a horror/thriller, ""The Terminator"" is better for you. If you want special-effects and a really fun time, see ""T2."" They're both excellent films.""The Terminator"" is a great movie. It is one of my favorites; it is terrifying, horrifying, and 100 % entertaining. And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there, ""The Terminator"" has some thought put into its plot, and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind.",The Terminator
40,disdressed12,"""I'll be back""",8,23 November 2007,"what can one say about this movie.i mean it's a true classic,and was way ahead of it's time,in terms of its vision.it launched director James Cameron's career into high gear.it made a big household name of of Arnie.his performance in this movie is pitch perfect as the title character,an unstoppable killing machine.Linda Hamilton and Michael Bien are also good.the effects were pretty good for the time,i think,though there weren't that many.there is even a bit of humour in the mix,with some great,memorable one liners.the movie definitely leaves an impact,and has had a huge influence in popular culture,even to this day.my vote for The Terminator is a very strong 8/10",The Terminator
41,KineticSeoul,Good start for a notorious sci-fi franchise and it's the film that was a big break for Arnold,7,7 May 2011,"This is a excellent sci-fi movie for it's time, it has a lot of the elements in this mixed together but works very well. The main villain is the one that stands out the most, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is basically a full machine in this literally when it comes to the plot aka The Terminator and he played his role in a pretty intimidating and menacingly manner, although he seemed a bit human at times when he is suppose to be a machine which isn't good. Especially since he is the villain and should not be showing emotions when it comes to facial expressions for this first movie in the franchise, even if it's slight at times. Although it will be different in the sequel, but for this it came off as a bit of a mistake, especially the mannerism in certain scenes. He just didn't seem like a full machine that is out to kill it's target because he seemed human, so it made the experience a bit slightly less frightening. But for it's time it's done very well. This is the beginning of a very notorious movie franchise that many people know of or at least heard about and I can see why by just watching this first movie. The script is well written and got my attention most of the way through even if it's a outdated and certain scenes just look way too fake. But even now this movie still holds up in today's standards because of the good direction and because it's well crafted. This movie also has classic phrases that are notorious and the way it reveals what is going on bit by bit is done pretty well, although some audiences will know what is going on pretty quickly, the execution is well crafted. This is a sci-fi/action movie with elements of horror and romance in it, but it's blended in just right and is worth seeing even if it's outdated by today's standards by a large margin and is a thrill to watch.7.8/10",The Terminator
42,OllieSuave-007,Interesting to see Arnold as the villain!,9,16 February 2015,"This is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature movies, where he stars as a cyborg sent from 2029 to 1984 by the machines to assassinate waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) so she would not give birth do John Connor. John will eventually lead humanity against the machines in a nuclear war.This is an exhilarating movie from start to finish, gaining steam right from the beginning when the Terminator appears almost immediately, wreaking havoc in the city, followed by the appearance of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who begins his mission to protect Sarah Connor. From the human chases to Arnold's catchy one-liners, and from the mysterious war to the explosions, this film has a suspenseful story by James Cameron, solid direction by James Cameron and an amazing, believable display of sci-fi effects by the Special and Visual Effects teams.The dreary atmosphere of the war-torn world under the hands of the machines gives you an eerie feeling of what might happen in a futuristic world and the mysterious plot line/mission as described by Kyle Reese gives the film its dramatic and intriguing element. And, Biehn and Hamilton had some good on-screen chemistry and Schwarzenegger is hilarious with his one-liners and proves he is a destructive force to be reckon with; after seeing Arnold as the butt-kicking action hero in many films, it is interesting and almost out-of-this-world to see him play the villain! The acting was good for the most part, though I thought Hamilton was a little too reserved at times. Brad Fiedel's music score needed a more mysterious and sci-fi feel, though I did like the Terminator theme, and some of the action scenes were a little overkill. But overall, this is a one of the most iconic films in cinema history and and is a must-see for any action and sci-fi movie fans.Grade A-",The Terminator
43,thesar-2,I'll Be Bare,8,2 October 2009,"One of the most amazing aspects of 'The Terminator,' was the story. Despite the extremely low budget, and the equally low-budget feel of the film, the movie had an extremely well thought out story. This is evident when they took this film into three additional sequels, made a mega-star out of Schwarzenegger and even produced a short-lived TV series. Unfortunately, despite the quality of story and the sci-fi aspect of the plot line, I viewed it more as a horror story than an action picture it was meant to be. I think it was the genre of films produced back on and around 1984. Only this one stood out, with solid performances by Hamilton, Biehn and, of course, Schwarzenegger. In the defining movie based on man vs. machines (tell me the makers of 'The Matrix' wasn't thinking about this movie throughout), comes a 'Judgment Day' apocalyptic war when machines take over in 1997 and man spends the rest of his days fighting the mistake we made. Back in time comes a ""terminator"" to kill the mother of the resistance leader in a valid tactical move, but thankfully, the leader also sends someone back to protect her – giving us valuable information in the process. While some of the graphics (and hair, oh, God, the hair) were extremely dated (also see: the closing, when Schwarzenegger finally loses his skin), the movie holds up very well, even 25 years later. And it's all thanks to the interesting and original story as well as the acting. Many imitated this movie; none came close to the heart of 'The Terminator.' I even loved the ending. Of course, it opened the doors to sequels, but if it ended with the storm coming, it would've been okay. They produced a quality product that honestly didn't need a continuation.",The Terminator
44,sol1218,People get ready. There's a storm a-coming,8,11 September 2009,"***SPOILERS*** The future clashes with the present in the film ""The Terminator"" when cyborg assassin played by the robotic-like and indestructible Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent back to 1984 L.A. on a mission of murder and survival. The Terminator's mission is to terminate Sarah Connors, Linda Hamilton, who's yet unborn son John will start a human uprising against the super intelligent machines who are destroying what's still left, in 2029, of the human race.As we as well as Sarah soon learn from time traveler Kyle Reese, Michael Biehn, a human freedom fighter and John Connors' top commander who's also sent back from the future-2029-that it's of the utmost importance for her to survive in order to give birth to John who's to lead a revolt and defeat the future machines which he in fact did. Sending the Terminator to kill Sarah is the only way the machines can checkmate John's destruction of them and it's his job, by any means necessary, to murder her in order to prevent that from happening!Non-stop action with the Terminator hell bent to murder Sarah and Reese doing his best to prevent that from happening. In his single-minded effort to rub out Sarah The Terminator spears no effort in arming himself to the teeth by knocking off a sporting goods store, and murdering its owner, as he goes out hunting for Sarah Connors in L.A and its surrounding suburbs. As things turn out the Terminator checking out the local L.A telephone book ends up murdering two other women with the identical name of Sarah Connors before he finally tracks down the one that he's really looking for at a local L.A disco. It's just then that Reese shows up and with shotgun blazing keeps the Terminator from completing his murderous mission.On the run from the police as well as the Terminator Reese and Sarah end up trapped by the killer cyborg at a deserted factory who by now, with all the bullets and bombs he's absorb, is nothing but a shell, with his outer plating or human features all but obliterated, of his former self!***SPOILER ALERT*** Explosive final sequence with the Terminator taring up the entire factory to get to both Sarah and Reese but ending up like the pile of junk-nuts & bolts and computer chips-that he at first started out as when he was created, or manufactured, back in 2029 by his masters and fellow nuts & bolts people the artificially intelligent machines! The mindless murderous and disrespectful,to the laws of man as well as nature, robotic brute was in the end himself terminated by the very person or persons, Sarah & Reese, who's lives he was out to extinguish with a super large dose of ""Terminal Justice""! As for Sarah she in fact did survive to give birth, out of wedlock, to her both future son and rebel hero John Connors. Knowing what the future holds Sarah is now making sure, via audio recordings and letters, that her soon to be born son will be ready for the monumental task, after a nuclear war started by the machines, that's awaiting him in the not so distant future: As the ""Savior"" of the ""Human Race""!",The Terminator
45,FeastMode,"original, thrilling and scary",8,26 June 2019,"Too awesome. I really love the terminator and everything about this series. This is a perfect introduction and way ahead of its time. awesome directing. Intense, thrilling, and even scary at times. Great action, very memorable score. so many great scenes and lines. The only downside to this movie was the technology which made some of the robot stuff look really unrealistic. I am ok with that from a movie made in 1984 (about 6 viewings)",The Terminator
46,Robert_duder,A Full on sci-fi action classic that defines the genre,9,30 October 2005,"If Arnold Schwarzenegger were to ever come close to deserving any sort of acclamation for his acting...academy award or otherwise this would have been it. This movie made him! and he in turn made this movie...he is and always will be The Terminator. Many forget that this original classic sci-fi action story he is NOT the hero. The Terminator is a deadly machine assassin sent into the past to destroy the mother of the man who will ultimately bring the machines to their end many years in the future. Schwarzenegger is deadly and brilliant, and robotic and downright evil. You can't help but be scared to death of this guy and that's awesome!! He doesn't have a lot of lines but he does the whole role with his motions and his reactions to things which makes for a pretty good actor I think.James Cameron who wrote and directed the film created one of the world's best sci fi stories. This film which takes place entirely in 1984 gives you such an in depth look at a world far beyond their current time. It's a world where a deadly war has practically wiped out the human race and now they are taking the battle through time in order to win it. Even in a brief flashback we are treated to a glimpse into the world that can only be described as pure hell. Throughout this entire film one woman is being brutally stalked by this beast of a robot and only one man from the future stands between them. Michael Biehn plays Kyle Reese with great intensity and a believability that he is indeed a soldier from the future. Despite the fact that it seems this Termintor is deadly and unstoppable, this man, this soldier is a worthy adversary. Linda Hamilton in her infamous role as Sarah Conner, the future mother of the man who will save humanity unless The Terminator can destroy her first. She seems like a such a quiet innocent person but as the movie progresses we see her character become stronger, faster, and just a worth adversary herself. She's not gonna die without a fight and she's not going to let this newfound knowledge of a bleak future ruin her. Biehn and Hamilton have awesome chemistry and you believe their relationship from the very beginning. The Terminator is the exact definition of non-stop action. It's constant, leaving you on the edge of your seat. Everyone's performance in the film is awesome and very watchable and you root for all of them. Best of all Schwarzenegger is an unbelievable machine that makes for one of film histories best bad guys. The film is gritty and very real, gory, bloody, no holds barred and without a doubt one of the best action films ever created. James Cameron created something unstoppable with this franchise. Everyone has to see The Termintor, it's just a must see movie and you won't be disappointed by what it has to offer!!! There is so much more to it than just your average action flick. 9/10",The Terminator
47,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Set a standard in sci-fi action films that has rarely been beaten and has endured for many years,10,15 December 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the year 2029, mankind is in a desperate battle with The Machines, that have risen from the ashes of the last war. Through a time travelling portal, exceptional soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) has travelled back in time to the year 1984, to protect Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will be the mother of John Connor, the leader of the Resistance. But Skynet, the computer defence system that set the machines on the world, has sent its own agent along, in the shape of The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a robotic soldier fitted with human flesh that is programmed to complete its mission at all costs.Re-released (in selected theatres) earlier this year to coincide with the release of the far inferior, effects driven Terminator: Genysis, fans of the franchise were taken back to where it all began, the rollicking roller-coaster ride, with breath taking special effects (for the time), pulse pounding action sequences and a far fetched, but conversely intelligent and elaborate story that no doubt played a big part in making it stand the test of time. In 1984, The Terminator was simply unlike anything anyone had ever seen before, and today could serve as an abject lesson to the effects-over-substance brigade.For anyone who never got in to the Conan films, this was the film that presented Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Mr. Universe champion turned actor, to the world. While not exactly oozing with what you'd call traditional acting talent, here his expressionless demeanour and cold, thick Austrian voice suited the skin of a cold blooded killer perfectly. He's no psychopath, though. He knows exactly what he's doing. Or, rather, what he's been programmed to do. And either him or his prey will have to be dead by the end for it to end. Sarah Connor's slow, dawning realization that her life is in danger is brilliantly orchestrated, after two women with the same name and the same age have already been dispatched and she becomes suspicious of everyone around her.It all builds to an explosive (literally) finale, where the killing machine is stripped to its bare bones and pursues his already worn down assailants inside a factory. Although its one of many effects that look a bit sub par now, somehow the tension and terror is no less palpable. And Arnie's ""I'll be back"" line is still somehow cool and as welcome in pop culture circles as ever. *****",The Terminator
48,ElMaruecan82,Fatality and Predestination or when running away can only be a temporary option,9,14 July 2015,"Simply said, ""The Terminator"" is a great film, and even greater when you watch it with the mindset of someone discovering it in 1984, a time when Arnold Schwarzenegger's career was still to be consolidated, when James Cameron wasn't yet that billion-ma'King of the world', when ""I'll be back"" was still a quote that could be heard in any film without being associated to a bad-ass catchphrase with an Austrian accent, when Linda Hamilton still looked like a lovely doll begging for protective hugs.In 1984, moviegoers went to see an entertaining B-movie starring that Conan-the-Barbarian-guy whose speech pattern could hardly be taken seriously. Even the producers and director expected a backslash from the critics. Little did they know that they had just made a milestone almost as significant for the Sci-fi genre as ""Alien"" five years before, and that their humility would be rewarded by a close-to-unanimous praise and a lightning propulsion into Pop- Culture. Arnie became THE ultimate action-movie icon, and the rest is no less legendary.And the reason the film works is its remarkable simplicity in each aspect. First of all, the plot : an Artificial Intelligence company named Skynet created such technologically advanced robots that they rebelled against humans and provoked a nuclear holocaust until they were almost defeated by the Rebel Chief John Connor. As a robot sent to kill his mother before he'd exist, Schwarzenegger appears at night, completely naked and takes some civilian clothes before tracking Sarah Connor. But we're in a basic Sci-fi movie and the villain calls for a hero, this is where Michael Biehn intervenes, he looks strong but he's not the alpha male muscular type, which eases the empathy process.His mission is to protect Sarah Connor and kill the Terminator, so running away can only be a temporary option. Yet if the villain ever inspires one thing, it is not to confront him. The Terminator doesn't know what Sarah Connor looks like, but that's not an issue, any Sarah Connor can potentially be John's mother and is terminated Skynet-style. The murders are straightforward and chilling. At first, the Police don't notice anything odd with that brutal murder, until a second Sarah Connor is gunned down. What kind of serial killer works by the name? Anyway, the most urgent is to protect any Sarah Connor living in L.A., including an adorable waitress, so far from that girl-power archetype from the sequel.And this is one of the film's beauties, the absolute contrast between the robotic killer and the harmless target. And this is where the casting pays off; Arnold Schwarzenegger was certainly criticized for the limitations of his acting range, especially at a time where his accent was stronger, but here, he's given a role that only an actor like him could have portrayed perfectly: a cold and implacable killing machine. The Terminator was nominated #22 villain in the American Film Institute, but he's not sadistic, nor vicious, he's just programmed that way, which is why he's so scary. He's like a steamroller of brutality that will ignore every obstacle until it gets him to Sarah Connor.And the film wouldn't have worked had Linda Hamilton looked or played it like Ellen Ripley in ""Alien"", Obviously, a woman like Sarah Connor needs a protection whether from the cops or from Biehn, and some bits of luck that will prevent her from the fatal encounter. Indeed, when the Terminator realizes he didn't kill the right woman although she lived in Sarah's house, begins a breathtaking, spellbinding cat-and-mouse chase. There are shootouts, there are car chases, but they felt different because this time, the enemy doesn't try to get at them but to kill them, they're means as well as ends. The Terminator is an unstoppable death warrant, guided by fatality. Notice the scene when, for once, Sarah gets the illusion of being finally protected, in a commissariat. The Terminator's ""I'll be back"", especially when heard for the first time, sums up everything, no matter how far away you try to push him, he'll get back to you.And this, resonates as the voice of fatality, the omen of an inevitable confrontation, something that neither Biehn nor Sarah can't avoid, the future has come to haunt them, and if Sarah is really the mother of a future fighter, even she will have to express that 'fighting' part of herself. Whether you look at the half-empty or half-full glass, you'll see ""Terminator"" as a predestination or fatality movie. And I guess this is why the appellation neo-noir isn't gratuitous. Noir is about people who try to escape from a painful certainty but can only triumph over it by confronting it, at the cost of something precious such as their innocence, their optimism, their faith on life or humanity.And 'The Terminator"" is mostly set at night, it features characters who hide from these robots that remind them the apocalyptic future they carry on their hands, their own responsibility. Of course, bonds ought to be made and we have some clues that the predestination thing will provide some curious loops that don't quite respect the orthodoxy of time travels. But the film isn't about time travels, it's about a sense of duty and responsibility. And in a way ""The Terminator"", as a villain, is an inspiration for the heroes, as much as he must kill them no mater what, they have to resist and to defeat him at any costs, the measure of a great antagonist is the degree to which he allows the heroes to overcome their weaknesses.As a matter of fact, the whole trilogy invites humans to question their condition, from being masters to slaves of the technology, what you can control can control you, it's all up to us to take the control of our lives back. That's what Sarah Connor will do, and this is why she becomes such a great heroine, the perfect match for such a great villain.",The Terminator
49,Pjtaylor-96-138044,He'll be back.,8,9 July 2019,"Since 'The Terminator (1984)' is so iconic, it's easy to forget just how downright solid its storytelling really is. I mean, the core concept alone is so 'out there' that it's a miracle it's as house-held as it currently is. It's really clever stuff. Basically, the feature takes the tropes of the 'slasher' genre and tells them through a science-fiction lens, with the classic 'unstoppable killer' literally being an unstoppable killing machine. The eponymous 'Terminator' doesn't think or feel and it has no sense of self-preservation. It exists for one purpose only: to kill the protagonist. All of this is excellently conveyed through performance (I needn't even mention Schwarzenegger), action and dialogue; the film takes its antagonist seriously so so do we. This makes for a tense and engaging experience that's effortlessly propelled by its world-building. This alone would make for a compelling story, but Cameron wasn't content with keeping things that simple. Instead, he decided to create one of the most satisfying time-travel narratives to date. The whole thing feels incredibly insular yet decidedly massive, as the relatively small-stakes central plot is perpetuated only by its context within the large-scale 'future war' and its world-ending consequences. Indeed, the flick is rather bold in its decision not to tie victory directly into 'saving of the world', rather to ensuring that it only gets destroyed so much: the nuclear war is inevitable but, eventually, the human resistance can win if it's allowed to exist in the first place. Having both the small-scale, in-the-moment, horror-driven elements and the near-intangible, sweeping, science-fiction stuff run simultaneously allows for a wonderfully unique and uniquely wonderful experience. Biehn's future-fighter, 'Reese', is a remarkably interesting character. The way he remembers things that haven't happened yet, his infrequent yet effective flashbacks to the post-apocalyptic future and the way he interacts with a version of a historical figure who has yet to do any of the things she's famous for are all intriguing and well-written. Also, the way he is used to convey exposition is particularly good, as it naturally hints at a much wider world than the budget could afford. Carter's 'Conner' initially comes across as a relatively generic 'final girl' but slowly garners more agency, culminating in a showdown that sees her finally accept what she must do to survive and do it with style. Her romance with 'Reese' is rushed, feels forced and, generally, could have been developed further, especially since it's integral to the story. Its introduction also marks a slower portion of the piece. Still, these issues are small when stacked against the flick's many positives. Overall, it's tense, exciting and enjoyable. It's a mash-up of many genres (including 'action', I'll add) that works far better than you might expect. Plus, its story, as iconic as it is, really is fantastic. 8/10",The Terminator
50,bowmanblue,"Often imitated, never bettered (apart from T2 perhaps)",10,8 August 2014,"The term 'pulp sci-fi' might have well been invented for The Terminator. Originally, it was a little-known sci-fi action film with equally little-known stars. However, it just happened to strike a chord with audiences and catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger to super-stardom and writer/director James Cameron to become one of the most powerful men behind the camera in Hollywood.It's easy to say that The Terminator would be best enjoyed by men and those who are well into their science fiction. However, perhaps one of The Terminator's major plus points, is that it seems to appeal to almost everyone who likes a decent film. Maybe it's to do with it having a well-acted leading lady who the female audience can identify with, but there are few people out there who haven't seen this film.In case you don't know... an indestructible cyborg is sent back through time from a world where machines have all but wiped out humanity. His mission is to kill the mother of the only man who will oppose the machines' rule in the future, Sarah Connor. Now, ordinarily, she probably wouldn't stand a chance against such a killer, but, luckily for her (and humanity) the humans of the future have sent back their best soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect her. And so ensure a cat and mouse game of chase where the two humans are constantly on the run from the relentless killer robot.Like I say... it would be easy to just say watch this if you like dark sci-fi/action. However, if you like film and generally good films, this one's only just over an hour and a half and you only have to read the other reviews to see that I'm not the only one who regards it as a classic.It's possibly the perfect action movie for adults and - amazingly - it possesses one other (almost) unique trait in the film industry - it has a sequel which (most people believe) surpasses it. If you like The Terminator (and most do) then you should check out its sequel, imaginatively titled Terminator 2. Bother are classics. Part 3 and 4 maybe go a little downhill, but, trust me, 1 and 2 have to be seen.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Terminator

Love the special effects from the period, and the synthesized soundtrack is pretty cool too. There are some cheesy moments (""we loved a lifetime's worth"") and one wonders why they didn't send back a few more Reese's since the fate of humanity depended on it, but I liked the spare plot and flashbacks/forward to the nightmarish future.

Besides Terminator, we got Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and more. The Terminator is a welcome addition to that group. Despite the low budget, this movie was a box office hit and a fan favorite.This is about a machine who came from the future in order to destroy Sarah Connor so she doesn't give birth to her son.Arnold proves in many movies that he knows how to do action. This must have been the first movie I rooted for the villain. Don't get me wrong, I still sympathized with Sarah. It's just that The Terminator is very hardcore.Overall, this is a masterpiece by James Cameron. If it wasn't for a semi slow start, this movie is perfect. I rate this film 9/10.",The Terminator

55,secondtake,A cultural touchstone and terrific plot that wears itself thin after some time has passed,7,9 February 2014,"The Terminator (1984)I just saw this first Terminator movie in 2014 for the third time, and I expected something more, and different from it. Naturally, the surprise is gone, and I think the plot idea is maybe the strongest point to the whole movie. The movie is directed with panache, for sure—the effects, the action, the deliberate lack of depth, the epic glossy wow of it all. But it's not a rich movie, it doesn't have depths, it frankly lacks enough to make a second or third viewing worth the trouble. Unless, of course, you are already invested and committed to it for personal reasons.The first shot, very early in the movie, when the naked Schwarzenegger appears crouched in the urban night, is archetypal and terrific. And then he moves and interacts (still naked, though you don't see that) and the comic element is in place. And here we have the movie, both profound to the point of being moved, and kitschy and puerile, too. It's sort of meant to be a accessible and direct, and that makes it a great first viewing. The plot is certainly loaded with big (huge) twists and mind-bending ideas. And we want so much for right to triumph over evil. You have to ask eventually about the acting. Maybe we need a stiff automaton in the role of the robotic machine that is known as the ""terminator"" (a cyborg). So the future governor of California is off the hook. But the other main lead, the woman known so well as Sarah Connor, is a so-so actress. No way around the plain approach she has to being a regular girl caught up in the largest story possible. The other time-traveller, a human played by Michael Biehn, is pure nuts and bolts stuff, too. In fact, it's hard to really love any of the performances, except maybe the police chief. All of this boils down to a movie that scores very high on concept and on the basic effects. This is what drives it to stardom. But leave it at that. Love it for what it is, plain and simple. James Cameron, the lauded and wealthy director in charge, is no genius here, but is very very able. That's a back-handed compliment, for sure. But lovers of Kubrick or Ridley Scott know what I mean.A re-alignment of the stars for this one. Over time.",The Terminator
56,CuriosityKilledShawn,Still cool today,8,22 April 2001,"I was fortunate enough to see a new digital print of this film with a new Dolby soundtrack. The new sound rocks and is a major improvement over the Mono from before.I'm not a big fan of Cameron as a director though. There are no huge comparisons between the terrifying Dark Future LA and the 1984 LA. As most scenes are shot at night in derelict parts of town the whole films looks miserable. It can also be so VERY, VERY 80's. Take a gander at the clothing and the music. The Technoir scene is a great example. Arnie is super-cool as the emotionless cyborg who just blows everyone away WITHOUT grinning at the camera. Michael Beihn makes for a good hero and Linda Hamilton is just as good as Sarah Connor. But she became really annoying in the sequel. It's a shame Lance Henrikson isn't in it for long and Dick Miller has an amusing cameo.It is quite scary in parts too. The steel exo-skeleton of the Terminator is not the kind of bad guy I'd wanna go up against and the visions of the robot war is rather ugly. Especially when we see the wheel crush up all the human skulls. Although it is quite unlikely that skulls would be piled up like that. Where are the rest of the bones?The Terminator theme is very cool but the rest of Brad Fiedel's score is absolutely terrible. It's nothing but inaudible noise. The same applies for T2 and his score for True Lies. Has anyone apart from Cameron ever employed him?Most of today's sci-fi is junk and quickly forgettable (Forgotten, AvP) but this has stood the test of time and will do for a long time to come, regardless of the 80's feel to it. But Cameron made it in 1.85:1, which sucks a film of this size deserves scope, but I guess he only worked with what he had. The second film, while not an improvement, is up to the same standard. See the new version of this movie if you can it's a great improvement over the older print.",The Terminator

Humans send Kyle Reese to save her. The rest is history.From today's perspective, this action SF is still good, but largely out-dated. Subjectively, I would rate it six out of ten. But when you take into account that it was filmed in 1984, that it had a serious impact on the genre and career of several actors, as well as anti-nuclear message and warning that technology develops faster than our ability to manage it safely, the rating must go up.8/10I would like to add another observation. If the film was exactly the same as it is, with the only difference that Terminator was not a robot but a ghost or a demon or something like that, it would probably be classified as a horror. This movie has all the elements of '80s horrors, and the only difference that distinguishes it from them is the quasi-scientific premise.",The Terminator
59,851222,Happy birthday to a monumental motion picture,10,30 October 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Terminator"" (1984) is a true classic, and one of the most important movies ever created. By ""important"" I mean that it started lots of things, which later became very common in cinema itself.There isn't anything new that I could write about this picture that was wasn't said hundred times before. Everything in this movie works and clicks on all cylinders. Made only for couple of bucks (in terms of today's sci-fi / ""actionier"" budget, even considering B movies) it stuck in people memories forever. How did maestro J. Cameron achieve that?Here are the main reasons in my opinion: Original and high concept story; Very good and believable acting by all involved; Great script; Cool action scenes; Terrific pacing; and of course all cudos to all technical stuff, effects, cinematography and so on. The idea was always the driving force behind movie, which is now safe to call masterpiece. J. Cameron proofed his genius with his first movie (first movie I mean ""Terminator"", not flying fish stuff J).Overall, as you have already saw this picture many times, there is nothing new to say. It's a true classic in every meaning of this word. Even now, 30 years after its release, this small budget B movie sci fi flick from 80's is still managing to attract audiences. If you could check some torrent sites, you would always see this film as one of the most down loadable, whenever you check it, no matter what season is, what movies there are – it's always among the most popular. It's simply just for one reason – a true movie entertainment is timeless and ageless.",The Terminator
60,atlasmb,There's A Storm Coming In,10,12 October 2021,"This film is more than one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. It is one of the greatest films of all time. It created some careers; it originated one of the best film franchises; it produced iconic lines and scenarios; and it even brought some important concepts into society's consciousness .It all starts with a killer script. Two men from the future are transported back to 1984 to locate Sarah Connor---a young waitress--- for mysterious reasons. Sarah (Linda Hamilton) finds herself embroiled in an unbelievable plot that changes her life. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays his role with a physical presence that makes his remarkable character believable.Though many are familiar with the film's plot, I will not divulge it here on the off-chance there is one person who does not know its beautifully complex story. There are moments of humor, moments of awe, moments of tenderness, and plenty moments of suspense and/or fear.James Cameron's amazing directorial career really began with this gem.

The plot doesn't holdup too well on scrutiny, but that's why it's called science fiction. Arnold makes one of filmdom's meanest villains and gets to utter one of his famous lines, ""I'll be back."" Biehn is likable as the hero and Hamilton makes a lovely damsel in distress. Cameron, working with a small budget in only his second feature film as director, keeps the action moving at a break-neck pace as the tension mounts. It gets a little silly towards the end, but is quite entertaining for the most part.",The Terminator
62,The-Sarkologist,The Movie with THE Classic Arnie one liner,8,13 December 2013,"I have seen the sequel more times that I can remember, and still love it, but I felt that I should return to the original and have a look at what that movie is like. I remember the first time I saw The Terminator - I was in high school and it was the grossest movie that I had ever seen. I say that because there is a scene where Arnie cuts open his arm and pops out his eye.The Terminator was little more that a B-grade horror movie with a sci-fi bent, but its popularity meant that a sequel was made which became a block-buster action movie. I will try not the mention the sequel as this is the movie that made it possible, and in some ways it is better. As an action movie, Terminator II rocks, but it is basically a remake of the first movie as the themes are very much the same.Linda Hamilton is a happy young Sarah Conner who works at a fast-food restaurant and generally leads a pleasant life. Everything changes when some guy begins executing all of the Sarah Conner's in Los Angeles, and when she is about to be executed as well, her saviour Kyle Reese leaps out and saves her. Both are then chased around Los Angeles by an unmercilous killing machine before Sarah manages to crush it in a factory, though Reese has died in the process. During this time, Reese sleeps with Conner and conceives John Conner, the guy who leads the humans to victory in a war against the robots.A lot of the things that I can say about this movie I have said in Terminator II because the themes are basically the same. It is a movie about how a life is saved through the death of another - Kyle Reese. It is about something that cannot be stopped, but it is stopped after Reese dies. I guess we know that Reese must die because he is in a place that is not his home, and he can never return. Okay, he loves Conner, but Los Angeles 1984 is not his home, and he cannot live here.There is no struggle with this as the focus is more on the horror of having something after you that you cannot stop. It seems to reflect the horror of death - something that comes after us that we cannot stop. The only reason that Conner survived is that Reese, a battle-trained soldier, was sent back to save her. The only way we can flee the uncertainty of death, is to trust in Jesus, who was sent to save us. In a way this movie seems to reflect this.The last thing that I must say about this movie is that it contains one of Hollywood's famous lines, and it is the line that made the movie - I'll be back - says Arnold Schwarzenegger to a desk sergeant before he drives a car through the door of the police station and shoots the place up. The fact that the Terminator droid is able to walk through a heavily armed police station and come out without a scratch simply shows how strong it is. Even then, Kyle is able to put a home-made bomb into his skeletal frame and blow it to bits.",The Terminator

64,slightlymad22,Everything Is Brilliant In Another Hit For Arnie,9,9 July 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie in order, I come to his second movie of 1984 The Terminator.Plot In A Paragraph: A cyborg (Arnie) is sent from the future with one mission. Kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) also sent from the future. To those that say Arnie can't act, I say watch this movie. He is TOTALLY believable as a non human!! I say that in jest of course, but it is his best performance thus far.He never could have took the role if Dino De Laurentis didn't release him from his 10 year Conan contract. He agreed, but asked Arnie to keep making Conans as long as they were profitable (Thankfully after the lukewarm reception to Conan The Destroyer, Dino never wanted to make another) and to make an action movie for him when he had a script. Arnie agreed, and was free to make other movies away from Dino. The $750,000 Arnie was paid for this was less than the $1,000,000 he was paid for the last Conan movie, but boy does it pay off. James Cameron is a genius, how all this came out of his head is amazing, and this is only his second feature film is beyond me. It's scarily brilliant. Everything is brilliant. The script is brilliant, the casting is brilliant, the performances are brilliant, the way it's shot is brilliant, Brad Fiedel's score is brilliant, Stan Wilsons special effects are brilliant, everything is brilliant. I've already praised Arnies performance, but Michael Biehn is also brilliant as the battled scarred, but brave Kyle Reece and Linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor too. I can't fault a single performance in the movie. A few dodgy effects here and there, and the implausibility of the plot (I still can't get my head around how Kyle can be John Connors Dad lol) are not enough to ruin anything. In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie talks about how the role of the Terminator only having 18 lines worried him, he worried people think he was either avoiding speaking parts, or worse, most of of his dialogue was edited out because it wasn't working. He also discusses how bad the promotion was for this movie. They had it as a standard B movie, he says how Cameron begged them to change the strategy of it, but they would not listen to him!! They were only interested in promoting Amadeus. The movie succeeded because of solid reviews and good word of mouth. The Terminator grossed $38 million at the domestic Box Office making it the 21st highest grossing movie of 1984. Surprisingly neither was enough to beat Conan The Barbarian as a career high for Arnie at that point. In a way, it's lucky for Arnie, Terminator wasn't a giant blockbuster, as he may have been typecast as a bad guy. As it was, he did a favour for Dino.",The Terminator
65,paulclaassen,Amazing action fantasy thriller!,8,16 July 2021,"And so the saga began nearly three decades ago. Before CGI, they had to build practical effects and improvise, and the 'Terminator' excels on every level considering the time when it was made.'The Terminator' is an incredible production, loaded with breathtaking action sequences and incredible visuals. Ok, so by now we're all familiar with the premise, so I'm not going to explain the movie (if you've never seen the film, where the hell have you been??). Whether you're into fantasy or not, this is a film that should appeal to the mainstream viewer thanks to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Admit it, 'The Terminator' would not have worked so well without his fabulous dry sense of humor, and unique appearance which makes him a perfect candidate to portray the villain. Despite the humor - mainly due to the character's ignorance - he is a real bad ass and ruthless killer.Linda Hamilton is likable as an ordinary girl, Sarah Connor, sharing an apartment with her best friend and working in a hamburger joint. Her character is relatable and believable. Speaking of likable, Michael Biehn makes a credible hero, Kyle (oh, and that well defined physique!).The plot might be a bit confusing, but they do try their best to explain. Only thing that bothers me, though: Kyle is sent from the future to protect Sarah Conner - who is marked for assassination because of her son, John Conner (who is not yet born). But Kyle then impregnates her, thus John's father. So, if he never came back, she wouldn't have given birth to John. So, how does this work that he was sent to protect her because of her son, if there wouldn't have been a son in the first place if he wasn't sent back? I can't seem to wrap my head around this, but nevertheless, it was a lot of fun!

67,Movie Nuttball,The Terminator is one of the greatest films ever!,10,23 November 2003,"This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time.This is the one that started it all! Arnold is excellent in it! Linda Hamilton was great! Michael Biehn was very good as the good guy! Paul Winfield was good! Lance Hendrickson played a different character! In their short roles Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were cool! Look for Dick Miller! The acting by the cast is very good! The action scenes are very exciting with lots of gun fire and the special effects are awesome! The music is great! Out of the three Terminator films it is hard to decide which is the best but this one is damn good! In fact its one of the best movies ever! I strongly recommend anyone who loves Arnold and the other cast members I mentioned and especially if you love action, sci-fi, or even horror movies to not rent but buy this classic! I recommend The Terminator!Movie Nuttball's NOTES:There is one scene that I really like in the Terminator! It is when Sarah Connor is at the dance club. What I love about it is the song and the excellent slow motion camera. Its when Sarah drops something, she goes to pick it up and while she is bending over The Terminator comes walking through the dance floor! Its a classic moment!Bill Paxton has been a part of three huge franchises! Being The Terminator as The Punk Leader, Aliens as Pvt. W. Hudson, and Predator 2 as Jerry Lambert! Lance Hendrickson has had a similar way of being in epics like Paxton being in The Terminator as Detective Vukovich, in Aliens as Bishop, Alien 3 as Bishop II, and as Charles Weyland in the upcoming 2004 movie Alien vs. Predator! Hendrickson, believe it or not was the original choice to play The Terminator! It is so amazing about this!By Paxton and Hendrickson being in these films and that Alien Vs. Predator is finally going to invade the theaters in 2004 could it be that this has happened for a reason? The reason possibly being this: In the great Dark Horse comic books there are many editions of Alien Vs. Predator and a edition of Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator! What I am saying is could this mean that Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator will be made into a huge motion picture or a Alien vs. The Terminator or even a Predator vs. The Terminator movie in the future? Its just a thought but what if? I am sure some writers and/or directors have talked about these subjects! I am also sure big fans of these films and of The Terminator would love to watch these icons battle it out!",The Terminator

Both the soldier and the cyborg are coming from the future (2029).I liked this movie a lot because of the amazing direction which was made by James Cameron who is also one of the writers. The plot was simple but interesting and it was combined with plenty of action and suspense. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that both Arnold Schwarzenegger who played as the Terminator and Michael Biehn who played as Kyle Reese were simply amazing. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Linda Hamilton's who played as Sarah Connor. Finally, I believe that James Cameron established very well the main characters of the movie in order to create an exceptional franchise.",The Terminator
69,zkonedog,Great Storytelling: A Little Bit Of Everything,9,1 March 2017,"Time-travel. Science fiction. Visions of the future. Action/Adventure. You name it, and ""The Terminator"", one of the most genre-diverse films ever made, probably has it.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins in the year 1984. Out of thin air, two individuals suddenly appear and are searching for the same woman: Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). One man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) wants to protect her. The other, a machine simple known as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to kill her. As the story unwinds and the chase continues, we are introduced to an intriguing storyline involving time-travel and the fate of the planet.Simply stated, this movie remains a classic to this day because it tells such an engaging, interesting story. It balances the time travel and sci-fi aspects with real-life drama and action. There is a little something for everyone.This was the movie that made the name James Cameron famous, and one can tell that he put a lot of effort into this undertaking. He tells a story that is actually too big (technically-speaking) for it's britches, as it is now obvious that copious amounts of either CGI or plastic were used to create some of the effects. Instead of dating the film, though, these little anachronisms actually give it a bit of gravitas. It was as if Cameron wanted so badly to direct this story, but had to rely on sub-standard equipment to ""get the job done"".Overall, ""The Terminator"" is an 80s classic. It is now kind of stereotyped as ""I'll be back"" and ""just a shoot-em-up"" chase film, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Go back and watch it again, and I promise you'll be equally impressed with the storytelling ability. That, at it's core, is what makes this movie relevant 30 years later.",The Terminator

Now finally watching this movie in full and paying closer attention to detail, one can see as to why it is as highly praised as it is.What stands out is not only Arnold's performance as the Terminator but the pacing of the film is top notch and it keeps the audience guessing each way. The suspense and mystery is intriguing and we are watching to see what happens next.Filled with many great action scenes and a plot that makes us think- and sets our mind thinking about possible realistic outcomes.

71,poe426,The Outer Limits redux...,10,24 May 2009,"When I saw this one in 1984, I couldn't help but point out that it was nothing new: anyone who's seen THE OUTER LIMITS (the original, black and white series) can attest to that. THE TERMINATOR ""borrows liberally"" from at least three episodes: THE MAN WHO WAS NEVER BORN, SOLDIER, and DEMON WITH A GLASS HAND. The latter two episodes were both written by noted Fantasist Harlan Ellison. He would sue the filmmakers for plagiarism and win. (When the movie played theaters, the ""acknowledgement to the works of Harlan Ellison"" did NOT appear at the end of the movie.) Cameron and company took the romance between Martin Landau and the soon-to-be mother of the man who would bring about the end of civilization from THE MAN WHO WAS NEVER BORN and coupled it, if you will, with the time-traveling title character from SOLDIER (brilliantly played by Michael Ansara) and the Mandroid (another brilliant performance, by Robert Culp) from DEMON WITH THE GLASS HAND. Focusing more on action than anything else (though it's Michael Bien's passionate performance as the hero that makes the movie worth watching), THE TERMINATOR proved the perfect vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger: he says little, but is physically imposing enough to intimidate anyone he comes into contact with. The fx were good enough for their time (and still hold up on the small screen) and the music is unforgettable.",The Terminator
72,johnnyboyz,"More lacking beneath the surface of explosions and gunfire than I remember, but still very much worth a watch.",7,13 April 2017,"The story goes that the inspiration behind the idea of the Terminator films derives from a bout of illness its creator, James Cameron, had whilst working on a previous project that had tumbled into being a bit of a creative nightmare. Frantically trying to piece what turned out to be ""Piranha: The Spawning"" together in an edit lab against a ticking clock, Cameron became run down by something which gave him all sorts of unpleasant dreams about indestructible robots chasing him; his life being in mortal danger and nobody believing him.It is perhaps the nightmarish quality of ""The Terminator"" which really allows it to stand out. Let us not mince our words, here – Cameron essentially hopped from one exploitation feature to another in making it. Everything that needs to be present for an effective Z-movie is present: the gore; the action; the nudity; the causality and the lack of a plot. That is not to be rude to the IDEA, which is wonderful - a robot killing machine is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of a brave resistance leader, who is proving to be a thorn in the side of the metal maniacs in their attempts to wipe out every last human-being. One of Cameron's characters even pokes fun at the premise, describing what the robot is attempting to do as a kind of ""retroactive abortion"". It is, however, little more than a cue for all-out mayhem across the urban sprawl of Los Angeles.We have all read the essays and digested the feminist theory which revolves around the character of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) enough times by now for anybody to need to rehash it here. Put simply, Connor is the aforementioned target – the protagonist who learns of her destiny and is taken from being your generic bimbo, and a useless waitress, to a brave soldier. Later theory would revolve around Connor and the Terminator character transgressing their respective roles in the sequel, which had the 'killer' robot being reprogrammed to become a mother/guardian figure and Hamilton's character tooling up to wipe out a defenceless anomaly (Miles Bennett Dyson) for being something they were not even privy to.Chasing Connor here is Arnold Schwarzenegger's titular Terminator: a metal exoskeleton operating underneath living flesh tissue and impervious to the pathetic weaponry of the 1980's, while also sent back is one of the future humans' top fieldsmen in Kyle Reece (Michael Biehn). One of the most endearing things about watching the film now, I suppose, is that each are playing the roles they are most famous for. The opening exchanges, as both time-travellers adapt to their surroundings; tools up to take the other on and go about hunting down Sarah, are good value. We witness The Terminator dealing with three rough-shot punks upon arrival with the simplest of ease, while Reece is depicted as actually having to run away and hide when the police pick up on his otherworldly arrival. Cameron's goal is fairly obvious: the odds are stacked against the good guys.What follows is by no means 'bad', but it is remarkable as to how quickly the film settles into a causality driven process of action; chase and recovery – something is to be said, however, in the way Cameron kicks things back into life via the ingenious ways the Terminator picks back up on his prey again when it seems they've gotten away. More substantial is Cameron's social commentary, not to mention the love story which develops between Reece and Connor. Cameron shoots on location in Los Angeles at night, capturing the down-to-Earth reality of homelessness; street hoodlums and the general junk and filth which litters the streets – making, in the process, a correlation between the nightmarish ruined LA of the future, where the war is taking place. The film goes on to use a very clever transitional edit using a caterpillar track during scene whereby Reece falls asleep and dreams of the future to reiterate this: utopias do not exist.Digging a little deeper, and analysing some of the franchise's cod-philosophies to do with destiny; making the future what it is and not being bound to your fate, may very well reveal one or two more truths, but that is for the individual viewer. On the whole, and while I am unsure as to whether there is as much substance here as everybody seems to remember, ""The Terminator"" does very little of what it attempts to do especially badly, and I think that is what propels its lasting power.",The Terminator
73,filipemanuelneto,It remains impressive more than thirty years after its debut.,7,29 January 2021,"This film is one of the action classics that has never left the TV since it premiered. It started a cinematographic franchise that developed later and has been one of the most dystopian visions of the future of humanity in cinema: an extermination war between humans and machines.In this film, Sarah Connor is a young girl like so many others. However, she is the target of a dark killer, who will not stop until she is killed. When he is about to succeed, another man appears, saves her and tells him the truth: the killer is actually a complex machine, sent to the past to kill her before she can give birth to a guerrilla commander who, fifty years from then, will lead the war against machines.If it is action that we are looking for, this film takes that expectation seriously: what it offers us is pure and hard action, from start to finish. It's full of normal and welcome elements in films like this: destroyed cars, car chases, police cars, exploding trucks, highway shootings, high-speed cars. Okay, these folks in the Eighties and Nineties don't seem to be able to design an action movie without destroying cars! Nothing against it, but it is something that I found curious. I particularly liked the shooting sequence at the police station, and the ending, at the factory, is just as memorable.Linda Hamilton is the most interesting actress in the cast. She is a good actress, and shows talent in the scenes where she is allowed to. I say this because the film was not nice to her: the only thing she does most of the time is to be in danger and to look scared and confused. Still, she did it sincerely. Michael Biehn has more time and opportunities to show what is worth, and he too was extremely competent in his work. But it is Arnold Schwarzenegger who takes the rug off them and makes the film iconic. The film is still from that time when he was just a muscle mountain, hard as steel, with a strong, barely disguised, German accent. He couldn't be better, and it's hard to imagine another actor for the role.James Cameron ensures an inspired direction. He knew how to guide his team and get the best out of his cast. Being a 1984 film, I was expecting something different, much more dated and looking ugly, as many films of that decade seem to be now. However, I was very impressed: cinematography is beautiful and the film is sharp and excellently filmed; sets and costumes are, of course, a reflection of the time, but that was to be expected. What about visual and special effects? Okay, I'm willing to concede that they seem archaic to our eyes, but here the fault is ours. James Cameron is an effects expert and used the best there was... in 1984. And in fact, considering it's age, special effects will look much more magnificent. Before finishing, a word of praise for the main theme of the soundtrack designed by Brad Fiedel in synthesizer: undoubtedly, one of the most striking soundtracks for action cinema.",The Terminator

76,digitalbeachbum,"Fun movie, but it ages poorly",1,18 February 2019,"I have a new policy for reviewing movies. No matter how much fun they are, if the premise/plot/script is seriously flawed then the movie doesn't work for me. It automatically receives a 1/10 rating.Time travel is a killer for all writers. If they don't understand the logic behind it then the movie fails because it isn't plausible. With that in mind, The Terminator could never plausibly happen therefore it should have only been a cartoon or at best an animated flick.Time travel with James Cameron is that The Terminator goes back in time to kill Sarah Connor, which it fails. The machines in the future would have known they failed, instantly.A thought experiment, using James Cameron's logic.If the machines calculated that killing Sarah Connor was needed so she wouldn't have a baby, why send another Terminator back to kill John Connor? They failed the first time, so why not send one back 30-40 years earlier, when she was a child? Why send one ten years later in time? Why stop there? Why not send one back to the 50 BC? Why not send twenty Terminators back to 100 BC? Technically they could have brought back with them the main processor, with the intelligent leader/program. They could have built everything from the ground up, destroy all humans and conquer humanity while humans have spears and swords.And to go further, why conquer humanity? The AI doesn't work that way, it wasn't programmed to have an EGO, so even if the AI became sentient why would a computer program have an EGO? Desires would have to be part of the programming. Desires would have to be originally programmed to be part of the program. If you claim ""I'm alive"" it means nothing in relation to your desires or feelings.Look, it's a fun movie. If you like it, then cool, enjoy the Sci-Fi of it. It's Arnold after all and doing the ""body count"" for the movie is always a fun aspect. Arguing over who could have lived and who must have died in the police station is definitely a funny discussion to have while watching the movie.With that being said, I give James Cameron 1/10 for this movie. Sorry Arnold. It's a fun movie, but the premise for the script is a complete failure.",The Terminator
77,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""The future"" inspires lots of great sci-fi movie-making thanks to ""Terminator""",8,30 December 2008,"The explosion of Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, the emergence of James Cameron, and a couple classic one-liners are among the many things ""Terminator"" brought into cinematic culture forever, but one of the least considered gifts of this 1984 smash sci-fi action thriller is the introduction of movie goers everywhere to ""the future.""A ""terminator"" cyborg (Schwarzenegger) is sent from the future with a specific objective to kill a girl named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Hot on the terminator's trail, however, is a human from the future named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who must save Sarah. Why? Sarah is the mother of John Connor, the leader of humanity's only resistance in the future when our machines/computers turn on us. The machines, desperate during this future war, have turned to time travel to completely eliminate Connor's existence. ""Terminator"" is a story that takes place in the present (well, 1984 present) but it's relevance is for the future and does include some ""flash-forwards"" of what creator James Cameron's man vs. machine apocalyptic future might look like. Most significantly, it's film's first serious attempt to imagine where science and technology might lead us.Sure, ""Star Trek"" and ""2001: Space Odyssey"" are among some of the ways Hollywood has imagined the future, but those are much more fantastical and not focused on Earth. ""Terminator"" is a much darker depiction that strongly considers science, not on dreaming up crazy sci-fi gadgets and the like. It's also more of an action thriller than sci-fi, seeing as the action mostly takes place in the 80s. Basically, the Terminator is an unstoppable force that follows Sarah and Kyle wherever they go no matter how many bullets he takes or explosions he endures. It's a non-stop thrill ride that really gets your blood pumping.While the movie thrives mostly on your amazement with the Terminator, wondering if he'll ever be stopped and how much carnage you'll get to watch along the way, eventually you get hooked on the future/sci-fi element as Kyle tells Sarah all about what's going on or he tries to convince the police to believe him. What makes each scene so attention-grabbing, however, is the mechanical nature of the way Cameron has shot this movie. Everything the terminator does is filmed in a very sequential manner, using lots of angles instead of constant camera movement. What's interesting is that he films construction vehicles and other normal machines we're used to in the same way, using close ups as if they're working on their own, without humans. It's his way of using the present to foreshadow the future.The acting in the movie and love story that develops between Sarah and Kyle are among it's biggest weak points. Hamilton is good, she really stands out as the most normal, human thing about the whole film, but Biehn is terrible as a lead actor. He comes across as creepy and odd and you only like him because he's helping Sarah, so when she starts to like him, you're kind of grossed out. Someone stronger would have made this a nearly flawless action film. So while ""Terminator' may seem like an example of a classic because of Schwarzenegger and all the action and explosions, it really leaves its mark as showing how capable Hollywood can be of creating an entertaining AND believable future, inspiring future films (no pun intended) to do just that.",The Terminator

79,Anonymous_Maxine,This movie didn't even need two spectacular sequels (so far) to be great.,10,6 July 2003,"The original Terminator is an extremely rare breed of science fiction film. It holds a spot in the memory and the imagination because it is so unique (which is a rarity these days, especially in science fiction), original, and intelligent (also a rarity). I have always had an almost unconditional love for movies that involve time travel, just because I find it to be such an interesting topic, but the time travel in The Terminator actually takes up relatively little of the overall storyline. Obviously, time travel is what makes the entire movie possible, but the plot itself focuses on Sarah Connor escaping from the brutally relentless terminator.After the terminator and Kyle Reese arrive back in 1984 early in the movie, really the only thing that time travel has to do with the story is that we know what the future will be like if the terminator is not stopped. Occasionally there are flashes into the future (mostly in Reese's nightmares), but for the most part the movie takes place in the present (well, 20 years ago now), where Sarah is fighting against an unkillable killer while trying to comprehend her role in the bleak future.
Arnold Schwarzenegger portrays the terminator with a stolidity and mechanical determination that only he can provide, setting the stage for many different things that would become traditional in the next two movies. Even the film score remains one of the most memorable film scores in film history, right up there with Star Wars, Halloween, and Robocop (come on, you remember the one from Robocop! It goes like this - Dun dun DUN dun der NER, dun dun DUN dun derrrrr, dun dun DUN dun DER NER nerrrrr.Remember now?).
The go-motion photography that is used to animate the metallic terminators renders their motion jerky and unreal, but keep in mind that this is 1984, before the age of computer animation. Even with the early special effects, the metal terminators themselves are so menacing and original that they secure themselves immediately a spot among the most recognizable figures in film history.(spoilers) Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn have a perfect chemistry onscreen, and it's interesting to watch their relationship blossom as we gradually realize that he's John Connor's father. One of the things that I've always loved about The Terminator movies are the subtleties that you can catch in the plot if you watch closely. There are definitely two timelines going on here, one in the present and one in the distant future, and you can learn a lot about them and how they're related by the things that the characters say.I was particularly impressed with the relationship between Reese and Sarah, because even Reese does not know that he is John Connor's father (and it's a good thing he is, too, because if it was someone else he could have seriously jeopardized the future of humankind by having sex with her!). Time travel involves a lot of paradoxes, such as in Back to the Future II, when Marty and Doc go to the year 2015 to save Marty's family from destruction, but if Marty and Jennifer are taken out of 1985 to go to 2015, they are no longer in 1985 to grow into the older ones that they find in 2015. This movie seems to have found a way around that, at least if you don't look TOO closely.Reese volunteered for the mission back to 1984 to stop the Terminator from killing John Connor, not knowing at the time (and Connor also not knowing) that if he hadn't volunteered Connor would never have been born. Maybe a coincidence, or maybe this is still fate working for them. Connor was born BECAUSE Reese volunteered, so maybe it's not coincidence but cause and effect. At any rate, the necessary facts are there. John Connor never met his father and doesn't know who he is, and neither does Reese. The only thing either of them know is that he dies before the war. At this point you should remind yourself that not only is this a science fiction movie, but it's a science fiction movie made in the 80s. This is VERY well written.Another small detail that I really liked about the movie is that Reese gives Sarah a picture of her that John Connor had given him to take back so he'd recognized her (this is something that NONE of the terminators in all 3 movies (so far) were provided with, by the way), and he tells her that he studied every line and every detail about the picture, and always wondered what she was thinking about when the picture was taken. At the end of the movie, we find out.The movie kind of gets around the Back to the Future II problem in that, even though Reese is killed in 1984, he can still exist in the future to be sent back by John Connor. Unlike Marty McFly, He was born in the future and sent back to the past, so his death in the past does not change his existence in the future. And besides that, we can still have a sequel to the movie because Sarah ultimately killing the Terminator sent back to kill her does not win the war, it just prevents the total eradication of humans, so we're basically back to where we started.The other thing that comes to mind here is that, in order for neither John or Reese to know who John's father is, Sarah has to die before the war. She survives in T2, but I have a feeling that Linda Hamilton turning down a role in T3 has something to do with he character dying between T2 and T3. But hey, even that fits perfectly into the story.As we learn in Terminator 2, the machines haven't lost because of the T-101's failure to kill Sarah Connor in T1, they just need to try something else. And as we learn in Terminator 3 (I may be about to spoil part of that movie too, so stop reading if you haven't seen it!), it is not the massive destruction of humanity that they are seeking to stop, because that can't be stopped at all. It is, instead, the resistance of humans that must be preserved to prevent our total extinction.The Terminator series deals a lot with the growing human desire to create machines to replace ourselves, taking this to the extreme of machines becoming so widespread that they attempt to destroy the human race and take over. I love the way it all comes about, which we don't really learn for sure until Terminator 3, since that's the only one of them (so far) that has been released after computers really exploded and became almost required in modern life.One of my favorite things about the Terminator series as a whole is that it gets better and better with every movie, taking into account new inventions and changes in modern life as it goes along and still managing to make the story work. With The Terminator, James Cameron has written and directed one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, despite the fact that many of the special effects are pretty badly dated (also look for Bill Paxton in his best role until Weird Science!). You walk away from a movie like this looking up at the sky and wondering. That's unheard of.

80,imseeg,"This somewhat cheap looking ACTION movie became an unexpected action classic. Didnt age too well, but the adrenaline fueled ACTION is still top notch!",5,15 June 2019,"I was astonished when I read how cheap this movie had to be made, back in the eighties; only 6 million dollars were available! There simply was no money at all ! And it only made 40 million at the box office. Terminator became much more popular though later on by repeated tv airings and video and dvd releases.Arnold Schwarzenegger wasnt yet a household name back then, he was merely a B-movie actor with muscles. Everything changed for the better with this movie. Terminator launched Arnie's carreer and rightfully so, because he portrayed the ultimate killing machine in a way that is still nervewrecking and fun to watch to this very day.Despite the cheap looking (sciencefiction) sets and some cheap looking special effects, there is something truly maniacal AND exciting about this action movie. A killing machine from the future (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has come to earth to kill an innocent woman. Why? And can he be stopped? This story is as ludicrous as can be, but the execution of the ACTION is fascinating nonetheless, because of the relentless killing spree, with contineous riveting action scenes upon action scenes. One big long adrenaline fueled ACTION party! The action photography is excellent!Terminator 2 is considered to be better by many and it is, because this original has got some quite corny and cheap moments, which are fortunately absent in the sequel. Terminator 2 does look way much better and has got a more credible portrayal of the characters. Only the terrific action in this original Terminator made me watch it though, because besides the action, the rest of the story is rather corny, cheap looking and outdated.Watch them both would be my advice, starting with the original, so things will get MUCH better when you start watching the sequel next.",The Terminator
81,jzappa,Tired of the Franchise? Don't Forget It Stands On Its Own Legs Quite Well.,10,7 September 2011,"Given that the world can take this movie completely for granted now, one can forget how gradually Cameron unravels what's happening with the two nude men who emerge one night from a torrent of voltage: One, a colossal Germanic beast, dispatches of a crew of punks to obtain their clothes first thing after he instantaneously regains his orientation. Those clothes, incidentally, should definitely not fit the much massive man, but that's merely one of a goodly figure of plot cavities that I only ever note after it's over: Like several ambitious thriller directors before him, Cameron reveals an exceptional skill at sustaining the action so summarily that this or that inconsistent detail doesn't matter. The second nude, Michael Biehn, doesn't have the same massive figure or imperviousness, but he has the vigilance and taut physique of an animal, stealing clothes too, managing to pinch a gun.By this stage we're beginning to note that this smaller man may not entirely be so formidable like the other, as he's conspicuously not killed anyone yet, but we still don't understand how any of it relates to the opening title card describing a war between humans and machines, or why both men have such a concern with the three Sarah Conners in the metro area phone book. It swiftly becomes clear to us which of the three is the one who counts, as we meet her in the form of Linda Hamilton. We see how tedious her life is, with her co-worker observing, in what we don't yet recognize is irony, that in 100 years, nobody will care. Then Sarah finds on the news that someone with precisely her name has been viciously murdered. Thinking little about it, she arranges for a night out with her roommate Ginger while the LAPD, led by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen, have to manage the second execution-style killing of a Sarah Connor in one day.We still don't know what's happening, theoretically at least: We saw the giant man murder the initial Sarah, we're not familiar with the second, and neither man has yet verified himself as trustworthy the slightest bit. So when the smaller man manages to begin stalking our Sarah, we've every cause to presume that he's trouble, and so does she, having by now gathered the murders lead straight to her. She dodges into an ascetically '80s club to call the police and disappear. Two presumably deadly, anonymous, wordless men hunt the same woman in the packed nightspot. At least one now has a substantial arsenal. Eventually, half hour in, one says his very first line of dialogue: ""Come with me if you want to live."" With hero and villain now conclusively determined, the movie's remainder is utterly a chase, Schwarzenegger pursuing the two humans through LA, slaughter and nothing else on his agenda. I remain unendingly stunned by how superbly Cameron sustains the tension: Unquestionably in that first half hour, there's not one second that's missing heart and soul, when even the essential exposition of Sarah's life is managed with utmost effectiveness. Even in the enormous info-dumps that Biehn is burdened with, we have no sense of the film slumping under the load of it all. When he bothers to tell Sarah, and us, the plot in essence, it comes directly after a climactic point, when we're viscerally prepared for the film to let us decompress.There's the cost-conscious way that Cameron shares information about Biehn and Schwarzenegger, ensuring that we'll be engrossed in deciphering who they are. The sharp-witted strokes characterizing Sarah, making her so authentic that we viscerally crave her survival until he can bother to show us just why we should be particularly concerned. Sarah as a convincing, appealing person is much due to Hamilton playing a young woman of no seeming significance pushed into a nightmare and never permitted to find her balance. This is usually the part that feels like just a bookmark, but Hamilton emphasizes her uncommonly distinctive sense of a woman in an '80s killer-stalking-girl flick.Biehn, never my favorite actor, nevertheless seems a sinewy, astute beast as much as a human. It evokes the frantic anguish of his future life, and makes us pity this tattered endurer. Meanwhile, the epically iconic rogue of the film: It takes authority, and in Schwarzenegger's case, a grand succession of close-mouthed expressions, tweaks of the head. He may be a machine, but he's a convincing one. It's a categorically star-making performance.Cinematographer Adam Greenberg encapsulates a grimy, murky world, scattered by overpowering fluorescents. Stan Winston's Terminator endoskeleton is the stuff of legend, even if some of the animatronics in certain shots are charmingly old-fashioned. Of all the collaborators, still, it's composer Brad Fiedel that merits the most affection: His throbbing, techno-flavored theme leads one of the finest film scores throughout all the 1980s, and it's maybe the best instrument Cameron has to use in maintaining the film's propulsion. It's exciting, dissonant and harsh, that unremitting bass line keeping the movie seeming like it'll never brake, not unless the menace is quelled. Cameron's assurance in his material brings his debut far beyond the standard of all the other films where the screenplay is merely a cause for explosions and car chases: It's a plot with import and desperate interests. Though the characters may be standards, they have persona, and their future is an issue of sincere apprehension.",The Terminator

83,Vartiainen,A cornerstone of science fiction films,9,13 January 2020,"The Terminator had a large role in launching the careers of many of its makers, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron. It has since become a beloved cult classic and the first film in a franchise that's still alive, kicking and doing well.So just what makes it work? What elevated this C-list dark scifi horror film above all that had come before? Well, having one of the best action stars of the century as your villain definitely helps. Even if this was one of his earliest roles. It was also the second film of James Cameron, one of the most acclaimed directors of his time. So there's a lot of talent behind it.But even though the film has been shot and directed really well, and even though Arnold is just about perfect for the role of an inhuman killer cyborg mercilessly hunting Sarah Connor, the mother of the future rebellion, I think the main thing that caught people's attention, is the story. The future has been overrun by robots and in a bid to end the human rebellion they send one of their own into the past to hunt down the mother of John Connor, the leader of the humans. That's such an imaginative concept that it instantly hooks you in, and after that it's pure 80s horror style and action.It also helps that the special effects are really good, especially for mid-80s. Sure you can spot when Arnold isn't really there, for example, but the effects would look pretty good even today and the dark aesthetic helps hide a lot of the crimes.One of the best movies to come out of the 80s and still one of the best scifi horror films ever made.",The Terminator

First, there was the first two ""Conan"" movies, now here's one that will be a true classic of his, ""The Terminator"". The Terminator is a stoic killing machine that its purpose is to ""terminate"" its target. This cyborg, is very determined and nothing can stop him. Until one man from the future named Reese(Michael Biehn) who went after the cyborg to stop him. The Terminator seems to be more ruthless than any criminal of any class. After he gets the weapons of choice, he kills the shop owner. Why would he kill the owner when he's only target is Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). However, The Terminator got to a few wrong Sarah Connors. The first one, was a mother one bullet to the head was bad enough, did he have to totally ambush her?

Even when they used the obvious dummy for Schwarzenegger's face right after he took out his eyeball, it looked good. If they had had the techniques in CGI we have now, it would have been much better, but alas! They did not.This was an excellent story which was well-executed, and was far greater than the sum of its parts. I loved it through and through.

88,bsmith5552,The Role Arnold Was Born To Play!,8,4 March 2007,"""The Terminator"" is arguably the role that Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play. It is, in my humble opinion, his best film. It's the only time in his career, I believe, where he played a totally villainous character with no redeeming qualities (forget about ""The Iceman"" in that Batman film).Written and directed by James Cameron, the action and suspense are non-stop from start to finish. And the best part is that Arnold has minimal dialog, which I believe adds to the sinister nature of his character.The Terminator (Arnold) is sent back to the present (i.e. 1984) from 2029 to terminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to a futuristic leader, John Connor. Also traveling back in time is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who is sent by Connor to stop the terminator.We learn from Reese that the terminator is a cyborg, part machine, part human who is programmed only to seek out and kill Sarah Connor. He has no feeling and cannot be reasoned with. Two other women with the same name are murdered by the terminator before Sarah realizes the Reese is trying to help her. We also learn that neither Reese nor the terminator can return to the future.The police, led by Lt. Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) and Detective Hal Vukoviich (Lance Henriksen) try to give Sarah police protection. When the terminator tracks her down to the police station. Arnold utters his now famous line: ""Ah'll be back!""

He came across as threatening and creepy as all get out, and the thick accent really played for the role.And then, of course, the plot was so unbelievable that it sucked everyone right in, from the start you suspended your disbelief because you knew it was going to be one heck of a ride.The cinematography was absolutely brilliant, everything seemed to fall into place perfectly for the first outing of the Terminator franchise and we got to see Sarah Connor transform from a frightened waitress at the start of the film, to someone that would become on of science-fiction's best known heroes by the end of it.It was a truly fantastic film.",The Terminator
92,freemantle_uk,'I'll be back',10,9 October 2009,"The Terminator is a modern classic. It is a great example of action cinema, making Arnold Schwarzenegger in a superhero, being James Cameron's first major hit and cements Stan Winston reputation as a special effects wizard.The premise of The Terminator is simple, a cyborg is sent back in time to kill the mother of the leader of the human resistance before he is born. In the year 2029, the world is in the aftermath of a nuclear war and machines have taken over the world. But the machines have lost to the human resistance, and they send back a Terminator (800-series) (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to kill Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton). The humans send Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) as a protector, and both have to battle to cyborg and the police to save themselves.The story is simple and effective. It is just a mighty entertaining film, with great dialogue and wonderful action scene. They are visions of an apocalyptic future, as well as the scenes set in 1984, with The Terminator and Kyle Reese cause death and destruction across Los Andreas. James Cameron shows his skill as a writer and director, focusing on character development of his two main characters, showing how Sarah Conner turned from a scared kid to a strong woman that she becomes. The Terminator is show to be a totally ruthless machine, and it is easily the best role Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever done. I love the use of models, showing the dedication of James Cameron and Stan Winston to the project. They were great designs throughout the film. The film does have a B-Movie feel to it, but that what people like about it. It was meant to be fun. It is an example of gun porn and the fear of nuclear war which is often a theme in Cameron's films.A must see for film fans.",The Terminator
93,dee.reid,Question: Why Is This Movie So Popular?,10,7 November 2001,"Answer: Because The Terminator is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made.  That's why.The story is familiar to countless fans, so I won't go too deep into it. In the not-to-distant future, a war is being fought between humans and killer machines.  The machines are on the verge of losing the war.  So they desperately send a killer cyborg called a T-800 or a Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 to kill a woman named Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) who is destined to give birth to the leader of the human resistance, John Connor.  The humans however, send a brave soldier back in time to intercept the Terminator.  His name is Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn).  Now only one question is left.  Who will reach Sarah first: Reese or the Terminator?This has to be one of the greatest sci-fi films to come out during the 1980's.  It is also director James Cameron's second best film behind Aliens.This movie has so many good action scenes, my favorite being the police massacre scene because it shows just how cold and relentless the Terminator is in pursuit of something it wants.This is definitely Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role yet.  He has yet been able to top it off.  His performance in T2 was alright but it wasn't typical Schwarzenegger.  Michael Biehn probably gives his best performance here also.  His role in Aliens was pretty awesome, too.  He did take a turn in The Abyss by playing a bad guy.  Linda Hamilton, an extremely underused actress plays probably her most convincing role of her career.  Her performance in T2 was great, but it's sad that she won't be appearing in the T3.One final note about the Special Edition DVD.  The many special features it has like the ""Terminated"" scenes and stuff is cool, but the sound quality of the remastered version is poor.  The reason why I probably hate the remastered version so much is probably because I'm used to watching an old unmastered version of the movie that my dad taped off of Cinemax or HBO or something like that.The Terminator gets a 10/10.",The Terminator
94,Coxer99,The Terminator,7,30 May 1999,Arnold lumbers about blasting everything in sight with various weapons while his intended target (Hamilton) keeps a few steps ahead of him. Director Cameron excites at every turn with screeching car chases and flaming explosions. Followed by an amazing sequel.,The Terminator
95,robfollower,"The thing that won't die, and the nightmare that won't end.",10,2 November 2019,"T1 is really a pretty smart movie. It's Man vs. Machine in a really fake, low budget future. For the Machines to win, they send back a killer robot to kill Sarah Connor, who will mother a child named John, who in turn will grow up and one day lead The Resistance against the Machines. With her dead, no John, and the Machines win. So Man sends a man back in time (apparently, 10 years from now, in 2029, we'll be able to time travel) to stop The Terminator so John can be born. The story holds up nicely, but the action sequences have been done to death so many times since, they don't fare as well. Yet the movie manages to give you the feeling that the studio had no part in the creative process, and let them just make their little movie. Here's $6 mil, Jimmy, go out and play. I just read that James Cameron had the image of the metallic skeleton killer robot first, and worked backwards from there. And because of budget constrictions (he couldn't have a future that looked all that good, in the movie, not in real life), so he made it a time travel story so he can shoot in present day. Pretty cool, if it's true. I wonder if that happened to him with TITANIC?So like I said, some of the movie doesn't kick the way it did in 1984. For that matter, what does? David Lee Roth? Anyway, the good far outweighs the bad, and if you haven't seen it in decades, you should watch it again.",The Terminator
96,GiraffeDoor,Truly a classic of machisimo and fear.,9,2 December 2020,"This movie is very special to me. It has been an old favorite for so long. From those opening notes until the very end it is an enduring favorite.I suppose it is the height of '80s science fiction camp. Not exactly an elegant aesthetic but a rich and captivating one where the narrative over flows with masculinity and toughness.Say what you want about Schwarzenegger, but he is perfect as the relentless killing machine that cannot be reasoned with and cannot be stopped without a miracle.The action sequences and gun fire are exhilarating and the cinematic execution is heart stopping well thought through. This movie was indeed a work of passion even if it may not exactly be high brow.The only thing I can really be negative about is the awkward use of puppetry but somehow Cameron manages to make you want to invest feeling with the right type pf humor and the right type of pathos along the way.The ending always just makes me want to applaud and watch the sequel right away.",The Terminator
97,alindsay-al,A fantastic action film that was ahead of its time,9,12 March 2014,"When talking about the great sci fi action films the terminator is always near the top for me and was massively ahead of its time. The story sees that in the future the machines have taken over until they are defeated by a leader called John Connor. In a last ditch attempt they send a terminator back to the 1980s to kill his mother Sarah. In response Connor sends one of his best soldiers back to protect his mother. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger has become famous for his portrayal as the terminator and this is one of the best villain roles ever. He totally encapsulated what this cyborg needed to be and it is one of the best ever villain performances. Linda Hamilton is best known for her portrayal as Sarah Connor and she is really good in her role and because of her averagness you really care about her character and hope nothing bad happens to her. Lt traxler was a pretty good character too even though he isn't in the film that much. Maybe the only negative I have about this film is the character of Kyle Reese, i'm not sure if it's the performance or if he is really just good for exposition. The character was important and I just wasn't a big fan of the character. The story is simple but effective and it just works. Also James Cameron created a sci fi universe in this film and it is one that fits the dystopian idea perfectly. The script is great with the dialogue between the characters feeling natural and made the characters, also this film has some of the most iconic lines in film history in it. The style is fantastic with all the action scenes being exciting and high octane, also the design of the terminator was way ahead of its time and it was great in this film. Also the future scenes were great in the way they should be. Overall this is a fantastic film that you should definitely see.",The Terminator
98,MBunge,James Cameron should probably be more proud of this movie than anything else,8,3 June 2010,"It's hard to review a real classic. What do you say about a movie that's not just a great piece of entertainment, but is significant in the history of film? The Terminator tells us the story of Sara Connor (Linda Hamilton), an ordinary young woman who works as a waitress and lives with a roommate, who learns she's to give birth to the savior of humanity. That's what she hears from Reece (Michael Biehn), a soldier sent back from a post-apocalyptic future where machines and men are at war. Reece was sent back to protect her from a killer cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that also traveled from the future to kill Sara and erase her son from existence before he could lead Mankind is a successful war against their mechanical enemies.When you say a movie is about a killer cyborg from the future and a main character who has to discover her inner hero, that doesn't necessarily sound like a classic, does it? It sounds just like another mediocre-at-best sci-fi melodrama, just like a couple dozen other forgettable B movies made every year that fill up the space between the really good films at the theater and on cable, another fancy premise used to tie together a bunch of explosions and special effects. But The Terminator is sooooo much more than that.Virtually everything in this movie is better than it has any reason to be. Though it has a clever idea, at its core The Terminator is a fairly basic adventure story. It's not inherently deep or complex or profound. There's no real social commentary to it or any examination of essential human conflicts. It's a chase movie. One with a genuinely clever angle, but still a chase movie. That sort of film doesn't necessarily demand superior writing, acting or directing but all of those things are present in The Terminator.I think the best way to demonstrate how good this movie is, is too simply take note of the little things done well in this film that you wouldn't see in lesser works. The casting of Linda Hamilton is one of those things. For the most important female character in the story, most films would usually cast an actress a lot more attractive than Hamilton. She's really only a bit prettier than the other women in the film and she's really not even as pretty as her co-star, Michael Biehn. But the story of Sara Connor is about a normal, unexceptional woman becoming the sort of person who changes human history. If Sara is a stunning beauty, it undermines the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary.Take a look at the two cops played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen and the criminal psychologist played by Earl Boen. They're supporting characters whose purpose is to get the main characters from the first act into the third act. But even though they're not on screen for every long or have many lines, the actors make them into people just as real as Sara or Reece. And those three characters actually have some of the best and funniest lines of dialog in the whole movie.Consider the character of Reece. He has less than a handful of lines of dialog in the first third of the film, but we understand more about him than any other character through his actions and his memories. Or look at how the film handles the Inevitable Exposition Dump. In this sort of genre picture, whether it's sci-fi or horror or what have you, there's always a moment when some character has to explain what's going on to another character, and by extension to the audience. The Terminator has one of those scenes, but instead of it happening during a dead space when the story comes to a stop, most of it occurs in the middle of a car chase! You can also marvel as the visual sense Cameron brings to the entire film. From one of the earliest scenes where a naked Arnold Schwarzenegger stares down at nighttime Los Angeles to the final moment where Sara Connor drives down a lonely road as a storm approaches, Cameron is always reaching for something better than what you usually get from this sort of action flick.The Terminator didn't just help create one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history. It's one of the foundations of the modern sci-fi action genre. It's one of those films that help you appreciate just how good movies can be. It's a classic.",The Terminator
99,Fluke_Skywalker,A timeless action classic,8,2 November 2014,"A few dodgy f/x shots and some questionable mid-80s dance music aside, James Cameron's 30 year old 'The Terminator' holds up and then some. Like its title character, this movie is just relentless, always charging straight ahead and only pausing long enough for some well executed character development before setting off again.The cast is so uniformly perfect that you can't even imagine anyone else in their roles. It was a star making turn for Arnold, and deservedly so, but Linda Hamilton, and particularly Michael Biehn, are also fantastic.We all know that the entire premise--clever as it is, and as well as it's executed--doesn't hold up to much intellectual scrutiny, but in a movie populated by cyborgs and such, I'm willing to give in and just enjoy.",The Terminator
100,smatysia,"""That's what it does! That's ALL it does!""",9,13 August 2017,"A genuinely iconic film that made the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It let Schwarzenegger slip the bounds of his very limited niche as a bodybuilder and made him an action star. Cameron didn't seem to see it as a science fiction film, but it is now a classic in that genre. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were fantastic as well. There are a lot of comments about plot holes, but there are always going to be possible paradoxes when it comes to time travel movies/books. The effects were pretty awesome for 1984. The terminator itself, with its relentless focus on its mission, has also become an iconic character/idea. You really have to give Cameron his props for imagination. Note to Cameron: There is probably an entire movie waiting to be made in the 2029 world of John Conner/humans vs. Skynet/HK's/terminators.",The Terminator
101,Nazi_Fighter_David,One of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...,9,27 July 2003,"In one of the most intelligent and unhesitating science fiction films of the 1950s, Robert Wise equipped ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" with technical marvels, chief among them the huge robot Gortthe prototype, Michael Rennie suggests, for a global police force... Similar mechanical giants have been lumbering out of space-ships ever since...In ""Devil Girl from Mars,"" the giant refrigerator robot Chai hunts for virile Scotsmen and find John Laurie, while in 'Target Earth,' the Venusian robots imitate Gort in projecting rays from their heads but take the idea a step further and make the rays lethal... In Stanley Kubrick's 'mythological documentary,' HAL 9000 computer is the most human character in the movie... But in James Cameron's breakthrough feature, there is, indeed, 'a storm coming in.' His 'Terminator' is a systematic metal, 'surrounded by living tissue,' an invulnerable cyborg, part man, part machine, with whom 'it can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.' The film opens with two naked men appearing in two different parts of Los Angeles' darkened streets... One is tall and powerfully built, the other is compact and muscular... Both men seek the same person, a small and delicate blond woman by the name of Sarah Connor...Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrifying as the 'killer cyborg' who 'looks like Death rendered in steel.' He has searched the phone book and brutally shot to death other unfortunate women who bear the same name... He is sent back from the future to present-day (1984) to kill the mother of an unborn enemy... Schwarzenegger moves with inhuman speed bounding like a panther, scanning methodically with dominated blue eyes his surroundings, and in a perfect simulation of voice, he is on the track of his victim... He examines his weapons with precise movements, drives expressionlessly, and kills without pity, or remorse, or fear... It is a role that suits his talent perfectly... Michael Biehn seems scared by traumas of others wars... His face outlines a long burn scar... He tries to stop Schwarzenegger's attempts to be carried out... He is sinister in his long coat... His whole life has been combat... He identifies himself as Reese, a soldier from the future, assigned to protect Sarah at all costs... For him it is an honor, a chance to meet the legend... We feel his pain and anguish when he said: 'That terminator is out there. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!' Linda Hamilton is quiet convincing as the strong innocent prey, targeted for termination, momentarily disoriented, vaguely disturbed... She feels a blind panic boiling up within her, a lightning blot of terror greater than she could ever imagine... She is in a daze, paralyzed, shivering silently, uncontrollably... Her fragile personality disguises a hidden force she did't know she had...Cameron makes a successful move behind the lens in one of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...",The Terminator

107,slokes,Lethally Efficient Entertainment Machine,9,22 July 2015,"The police psychologist interviewing Kyle Reese says it just right at one point: ""I could make a career out of this guy!"" Make that two careers, that of action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger and blockbuster filmmaker James Cameron.Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a struggling waitress who has just been stood up for a date. Another date is en route; unfortunately for her it's the proverbial date from hell. He may look like a studly Austrian-American bodybuilder, but he's really a hyperalloy metal chassis wrapped in human tissue sent from the future to kill her before she can give birth to the hope of mankind's survival. Can Kyle (Michael Biehn) save her before Arnold does his job?The title character is really a thing of beauty. As Kyle explains: ""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever! Until you are dead.""So what you have is ""Jaws"" for a new decade. And there can be no doubt what that decade is. From the Walkman worn by Sarah's roommate to the trendy neon sportswear on display at the ""Technoir"" nightclub, this is a 1980s movie through and through. And other than some clunky miniatures work set in the world Kyle came from, there's nothing wrong with that.The film has a lot more going for it. From start to stop this is, like ""Jaws,"" a pop-action spectacular that never stops. Even the lengthy time-travel exposition scenes are suspenseful, because you are always alert for what might come through the door in the next second. Schwarzenegger makes his most lasting impression in an atypical bad- guy role, while Hamilton convinces with her ruffled beauty and sudden bursts of heroism. Biehn may do the best job, his face suggesting the anguish of his character's plight as well as his somewhat crazy hope for the future personified in Sarah.Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd fashioned a clever script with many brilliant touches that reward re-viewings. There's a scene between Kyle and Sarah that brings ""Terminator's"" greatness into focus for me. He's telling her of this photograph he has been holding of her, and spent many terrible nights staring at, wondering what she was thinking. Later, Cameron has a scene where we get to see what Sarah was thinking, and it's a doozy!Then there's the police vehicle the Terminator rides around in trying to get his mark. The slogan on the side of the car reads: ""Dedicated To Serve."" Perfect!Is the Terminator supposed to be from THE future, or just ""one possible future""? Like Sarah says, a guy could go crazy thinking about this. Or at least have to wait until the next sequel. Hollywood can beat good ideas to death, but this film proves it will take a lot indeed to kill the Terminator.",The Terminator

109,dworldeater,Awesome,9,3 September 2015,"Arnold Schwarzenegger brings presence, intensity and menace in James Cameron's futuristic sci fi nightmare. James Cameron really showed his talents as not only a writer, but as a film maker in this classic. The story is fluent, the pace is frantic and is grounded by excellent direction, great performances and good dialogue. The tone of the film is dark and its ambiance is amped up by Brad Fiedel's ominous and percussive score. Stan Winston's special make up f/x are top notch. While Arnold as The Terminator is a focal point and in this role he is perfect, it would be criminal to overlook the rest of the cast in this picture. Michael Biehn gave an exceptional, intense balls out performance here and carries the story delivering exposition while being chased by The Terminator. Linda Hamilton is great too. She shows a lot of range in this film. Lance Hendrickson and Paul Winfield give brief, but memorable performances as cops. There also are some cool cameos from Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punk rockers. This movie is a solid production and holds up well. I am not much of a fan of the sequels. T2 is clearly the best of the lot, but after that James Cameron is no longer in the mix and from that point on continuity and quality drop.",The Terminator
110,Steffi_P,"""A serious attitude problem""",9,8 November 2011,"There has long been a tradition in cinema of actors whose good looks or sheer physicality far outstripped their Thespian talents. Of these Arnold Schwarzenegger is in a league of his own. His nickname of Austrian Oak seems to refer not just to his impressive stature but to his woodenness before the camera. And yet he became an icon in the 1980s by managing to get cast in parts which didn't stretch his disappointing range. What do you do with a monotonous voice and a body that looks like it could punch through concrete? You play a robot, that's what.Oh, sorry, not a robot. A *cyborg*Yes, the 1980s run of hi-octane sci-fi actioners was a boon for Schwarzenegger. The idea of some technological terror coming to get us was hardly new. It was the subject of a lot of 50s B-movies, and if you want to go back further you could include Frankenstein as well. The Terminator is essentially an update of these stories for the then-fledgling age of computers and robotics. It's not the best bit of writing ever. There is some woeful dialogue, and enough logical flaws in the plot to drive a juggernaut through, but this doesn't really matter because the screenplay only really exists to give us a thrilling action adventure. And the central premise – futuristic warriors battling it out over the life of a present day woman – provides a strong enough core to build any number of fight and chase scenes around.The Terminator was the second feature of James Cameron, and he shows early on a skillful blending of terror and excitement. The picture moves fast, so he doesn't have much time to establish elements of horror, but he is adept at throwing something into the frame – such as the prominent window behind Linda Hamilton – to introduce a little note of uncertainty and danger. To maintain the pace, Cameron's tack is to keep the images constantly moving, not letting the tempo down even in quiet moments. After Arnie utters the immortal ""I'll be back"" line, we cut between near identical close-ups of the desk sergeant's paperwork – an utterly pointless bit of editing narrative-wise but it brilliantly ratchets up the tension before it all kicks off. Cameron also loves to make the audience feel involved, frequently placing us within the action. The first shot in the modern day has the camera underneath the jaws of a monstrous-looking digger. Often characters are seen advancing towards the retreating camera. It's worth remembering that Cameron was of the first generation of filmmakers to be influenced by video games. Not that earlier directors hadn't used these techniques, but I think that idea of feeling like a participant in the action really helped shape his approach.The movie looks neat too despite what was a relatively low budget for the era and genre. They have really gone to town on all the tropes of the 80s action movie – dry ice, blue lightning and alleyways full of billowing newspapers and homeless people. In a way, that contrast between piercing white light and smoky shadow was the 80s equivalent of chiaroscuro lighting. Very often of course it is hiding the clunkiness of the special effects, which are strictly old-school. Personally I love the movie's pre-CGI charm. This really was a golden age for animatronics, even as they were becoming obsolete.So, where does Mr Schwarzenegger fit into all this? With The Terminator we have a movie where fast-paced action runs roughshod over logic, and it doesn't call for amazing dramatic performances. Look at the other players – Linda Hamilton is passable but not amazing, and Michael Biehn is dreadful to the point of irritating. Outside of this movie, both Hamilton and Biehn were better actors than Schwarzenegger, but here it is Arnie who is the most compelling and watchable, simply because playing a hard, mechanical killing machine is the one thing he could do really well. Just for once, he gets to be convincing, chilling, the captivating heart of the movie. Good for him.",The Terminator

Sarah is rescued by Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future who explains that she is being pursued by a Terminator, a cyborg assassin who will stop at nothing until it kills her This gripping, eye-popping, fast paced action/sci-fi hybrid is one of the best thrillers of the eighties, with one of the most memorable villains in all cinema. It's a terrific story which slam-dunks the bewildered heroine into the middle of a fight for survival against a backdrop of nuclear apocalypse. Like all the best suspense pictures, it follows a straight minimalist route; Reese sets the action with a brilliant speech, ""Listen, and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead !"". As this fearsome assassin, Big Arnie is simply perfect casting - his best role by a long chalk which suits his looks, his acting chops, everything. He cruises the city, a mean machine stalking his prey, and is a truly frightful fiend. Hamilton and Biehn are equally good; she is vulnerable and scared but not stupid and their resolve to outwit and survive near-impossible odds give the film a real dramatic core. The support cast are a lot of fun; Winfield and Henriksen do a nice Mutt and Jeff cop routine which is welcome light relief and there are funny bits by Miller as a gun shop clerk and Paxton as a street punk. The movie also has a terrific neo-noir atmosphere, thanks to Adam Greenberg's photography of L.A. at night, punctuated by hellish futuristic visions of irradiated rubble patrolled by nightmarish machines. Brad Fiedel's score, whilst occasionally a bit cheesy, has a great main theme and pumps everything along with pounding electronic percussion. The movie was written by Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, and fans cite it as a pioneering story of time travel and machine dystopia, although in practice it has many antecedents - sci-fi author Harlan Ellison sued the film for it similarities to his 1957 short story Soldier From Tomorrow, but there are also very similar Dr Who yarns, not to mention the last half-hour of Michael Crichton's Westworld. All of this doesn't matter however - what the film has going for it is good characterisation, fabulous direction, and a great Bad Man.

I actually prefer him as the bad guy too.The film is the usual quotient of corny, cheesey and hammy and not brilliantly acted by most involved, but in that typical eighties way that gets away with it.I used to think that 'T2: Judgement Day' was my favourite, but actually I think this one just has that something more going for it. It wasn't made to try and please everyone like T2. It's more raw than that.Admittedly the special effects aren't even 'Neville On The Broom' good, but again, because of the time it was filmed, it can be forgiven.It's a great story and pretty cleverly put together.

113,Spondonman,I won't be back,7,24 August 2014,"I stayed away from this for thirty years but finally got fed up of all the people absolutely amazed I hadn't seen it and recommending it to me before it's too late. Well, it's fairly exciting enough as a low budget sci fi chiller, but does everyone really have to enjoy the same things? And judging by the music and special effects, in this case it's too late. Even if I'd seen it at an impressionable age such macho machinations were never my bag.An impregnable robot sent from 45 years in the way distant future to kill a woman who will have an important son, and another man from the future is sent to save herand unwittingly impregnate her too. Busy! The futuristic '80's music is as cheap, backward and laughable as Blade Runner's is, they also share a vision of an extremely grim future. The present is merely cars girls guns and mayhem after all. Schwarzenegger as the Terminator robot acted totally believably, and when reduced to the hilarious internal metal frame he acted with even more passion; but Harryhausen's stop motion skeletons in Jason & The Argonauts were as kittens in comparison. Made at the butt-end of the olde analogue age I bet director Cameron wished he could have done a Lucas-like Revision to it and rebooted it with cgi cartoonery for the special effects instead. However, the over the top violence was expected and delivered - the utter childishness of the multiple random killings only proves yet again to me how valueless some human film makers think other human beings lives are and therefore the contempt they must hold the audiences in. But I do realise you don't have to be in the Army to fight in the War, and most importantly this is mild stuff compared to nowadays. The film was all I expected, take away the viciousness and you might have a very good little b film.",The Terminator
114,davidmvining,Closed loop,8,11 March 2021,"This is a testament to the power of craft in building a movie. Made inexpensively but never feeling cheap, James Cameron's first full directing credit (he worked a grand four production days on his first credited directing job, Piranha II: The Spawning) has the kind of polish one might expect from someone several movies deep. There's an assuredness to the filmmaking and storytelling while managing to feel surprisingly unconventional and working exceedingly well at the same time.There isn't a single line of expository dialogue for the first forty minutes. It's all tension building as we watch two men appear out of nowhere, steal clothes, acquire weapons, and make their way towards one Sarah Conner. These two men don't talk at all about who they are or what they want, but we get to watch as the two make their motives clear through action. The big hulking guy punches a punk through the stomach, steals clothes, and guns down a gun shop owner. The smaller guy steals pants off of a hobo, shoes and a jacket from a store, and a pair of guns from police officers without hurting them. One seems less bad than the other, but both end up just at the edge of Sarah Conner's frame without a clear indication of what they want from this ordinary girl.One of the interesting things about Sarah is that she is so strikingly ordinary. She's not that pretty. She's a waitress in a diner. She gets stood up by her date on a Friday night. She has no special skills or special knowledge, and the movie makes no effort to build her up as special this way. She's special for something that will happen in the future, and that ends up making her rather helpless in the present. She's not a badass, but she does need to learn to fight as much as she can over the course of a day, and it ends up just enough to survive.When Kyle Reese, the smaller one, finally catches up to Sarah, fighting off the big one, the Terminator, briefly, and the two run away from the scene together, we finally get our first smattering of exposition, again, more than forty minutes into the movie. I cannot express how much I love that the movie's entire first act goes by without explicit explanation. Cameron respects his audience enough to know follow along, but he also uses the lack of explanation as a source of tension, quieting the soundtrack down to largely ambient noise with the simple score by Brad Fiedel acting almost like a metronome in a similar way that Hans Zimmer's score felt like a watch in Dunkirk.The exposition dump is fine, as it is, broken up over several scenes as Reese explains to Sarah and then the police the state of the future. Breaking it up over a chase and an interrogation helps keep it from feeling quite so monotonous, and Michael Biehn gives it his all explaining the inexplicable to people who don't want to listen. Cameron flexes his action filmmaking muscles with the attack on the police station, a dark and dangerous feeling sequence where Reese and Sarah get out alive, and then the movie loses something.There's a wonderful irony at play in how The Terminator is constructed, that Reese got sent back in time by John Conner, his own son, and Reese didn't know it. However, because the action of the film takes place over the course of about a single day and Reese has to die in the end, that doesn't leave a whole lot of time for real emotional connection between Reese and Sarah. His side makes sense. In the future, he had Sarah's picture and grew to love her as an icon, the mother of humanity's savior, and an image. However, the feeling that she falls madly in love with him so quickly isn't handled all that convincingly. It feels more like a chemical thing brought on by adrenaline than anything else. More importantly, I think, is that the movie slows down incredibly to make this reasonably unconvincing display occur.For more than the movie's first hour, it's been a tense thrill ride with little sign of ever letting up. Then the two get away and everything just comes to a stop. There's no real tension left for a solid twenty minutes. I don't know if Cameron didn't trust his audience to stay with him on such a sustained thrill ride or if he just didn't know how to tell a love story that well, but the movie just doesn't feel quite right until the Terminator tracks the two down at their out of the way motel when it picks back up and becomes the movie we'd grown to love again.The final action beats are well done, stepping fully into monster horror territory with an antagonist that just won't go down until he's squashed by a hydraulic press. And this sequence is a very good microcosm of what I mean by inexpensive but never cheap. Cameron understood the limits of his budget, having made a short career in special effects up until this point. He throws every tool he has at the screen from models to puppets to stop motion to miniatures to just outright blowing stuff up, and it cuts together amazingly well to produce a cohesive experience.Now, there is one element of the production that feels cheap, and that's the score. It's not bad, but it feels like the entire thing was done on a synthesizer in a few days, which it probably was because Cameron had blown through his entire budget by the time it came to score the film. However, it works, and that's really all that's important.Linda Hamilton is fine as Sarah, playing a naïve waif turning into a somewhat confident woman fairly well. Michael Biehn gives it his all as Reese, imbuing the character with a lot of energy, passion, and exhaustion all at the same time. Arnold is a presence as the Terminator. My favorites, though, are Lance Henrikson (who was originally going to be the Terminator) and Paul Winfield as the two chief police officers, playing off of each other with enough character and energy to make them feel like far more than just movie cops.It's not perfect, but the film is a statement from a hungry, young, and impoverished director that he knew what he was doing and he could be trusted to create an engaging, energetic, and well-produced action spectacular.",The Terminator

116,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Excellent sci-fi horror/thriller,10,27 August 2012,"Who can turn down a James Cameron film like this? The Terminator (1984) is a classic on every level. The story was brilliantly written. The cast that was chosen for each role was done perfectly. The special effects, although very outdated by today's standards, still entertains and inspires the next generation of sci-fi filmmakers. And the music was an extreme role player throughout.The whole story itself is an enormous step in a new direction. At the time, no one was truly thinking about the possible downside to artificial intelligence. But who could have thought that machines could become smarter than humans and decide to take over? Well James Cameron did. The plot is so in depth with detail that it's hard not to become involved in the plot as well.Arnold Schwarzenegger being the choice of the Terminator was the best choice the casting department could have ever done. Not only is he good but he can be quite terrifying too. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was accurate because although she's scared quite often throughout the running time, she later becomes a much stronger individual. And Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese was a good choice too because he definitely acts and looks like a run down soldier looking to find a way to change the future that he came from.Stan Winston and his team of specialists provide the special effects and boy do they look great. With a mix of using puppetry and stop-motion animation, the entire look of the terminator is very interesting to watch. Not to mention that this thing can take a beating, either by its enemies or by itself! And the music by Brad Fiedel adds the final touch to the film. Fiedel makes the music have a sci-fi tone and whenever the terminator is on screen, there's a certain theme to it that gives it a very ominous feel. It's very creepy, but effective! It's surprising that director Cameron came to such glory from this movie after he directed such a sub-par film known as Piranha Part II: The Spawning (1981)!This is the film that launched director James Cameron into show biz. With all the elements picked out perfectly, The Terminator is bound to strike the right chord.",The Terminator

Arnold shows his prowess as the Terminator, a man sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton (who reprises her role in the sequel). Kyle Reese, played by Michael Beihn, is also sent from the future, this time to prevent her and her future son.

118,PredragReviews,I'll be back...,9,7 May 2016,"The original ""Terminator"" is arguably the greatest sci-fi/action film ever, and the Special Edition DVD finally does this classic film justice. In the future, SkyNET, the supercomputer in control of all military power, decides that humans must be destroyed and begins a massive nuclear war that destroys most of the population. The survivors form a resistance against the computer and its mechanical army, and eventually defeat it, thanks to their leader John Connor. In a final effort to win, the computer sends a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, before he is born. The humans send back a lone soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah from the seemingly unstoppable cyborg. I think what's so great about this movie is how you're slowly revealed the true form of the Terminator. Piece by piece he loses a chunk here, a chunk there. You know he's a machine with flesh over his endo-skeleton, but the full force of this implication isn't really felt until you see the machine without the flesh emerge from burning wreckage. I find the scene where the endo-skeleton is lurching very quickly toward the door as Sarah is struggling to close it far more terrifying than the whole Terminator apocalypse scenes in the sequels. But then again, those are action movies.Visually, the film is first rate. Fantasy II's future sequences and Stan Winston's make-up and Terminator endo-skeletons are some of the finest moments in Science Fiction film making. Even in this day and age of CG-everything, the rear projected, stop motion animated Terminator effects are still very good, standing up well in the light of eighteen years of technological innovation. Additionally, for the special edition DVD they redid some of the sound effects, like the Terminator's long-slide .45. There are lots of extras, including deleted scenes, still galleries, and two interview reels with Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, plus Biehn and Hamilton.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",The Terminator

120,pc95,Dated Music But Still Good,7,15 April 2017,"""The Terminator"" is director James Cameron's big ticket into the world of film, and rightfully so. He's put together an interesting, partly paranoid, gritty survival Sci-Fi Action mesh that ought to be rated highly given the apparent modest budget. While lead actress Linda Hamilton's gives a soft and maybe somewhat uneven performance, Cameron scores largely due to choosing Schwarzenegger for the lead villain. An article states Cameron was against casting Arnold initially, but the planned rejection-meeting changed and reversed his mind, and the rest is history. The action in the movie fairly competent. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is the back-story which is a great setup and give the movie some depth. Rewatching it, I hadn't seen in it in 15 years, but it is still a good watch minus the scene-cutover music which doesn't stand the test of time and makes and dates it sounding circus- like and cartoonish. You can forgive this though. Note Michael Biehn does solid job in supporting role. Recommended Sci-Fi, and certainly for Arnie fans -- 7/10.",The Terminator
121,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Great horror/ scifi, with a bit of intentional humour",7,6 July 2015,"One of the most memorable introductions, with his phonetic, computer- like diction (rarely used) , a most relentless stalker/ killer begins his search, ominously looking over LA sprawling out in front of him, from a hilltop. This apparent horror goes into science fiction territory, as we learn he is a machine sent from the future to kill a girl, and a man has also been sent to protect her at all costs.The sci-fi and horror elements are balanced with enough intentional humour, specifically from the police, to whom she goes for protection when the carnage begins. Film wisely gives the audience time to catch their breath. But the police are not merely there for comic relief, they take their job completely serious; it is their interaction with each other which evokes laughter. Yet they still have no idea what they have to protect her from, and are hopelessly at a loss when confronted by it.Calling, yet foreboding music score is a major asset. The metallic *ting* sound heard throughout the score give the film an industrial/ found object feel, which only compliments the film's tone. Classic and influential; marred only by a dippy, out-of-place love story subplot, which comes from out of nowhere and makes no sense.",The Terminator

In that decade, where there was action, there was Arnold. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most iconic film role, that of the unstoppable Terminator. In this science fiction/thriller milestone, the Terminator is a cyborg sent from the year 2029 to kill the mother of the man who would save mankind from the machines. Its a film nearly everyone has seen, so there isn't a whole lot to say about it. It was a great action flick that launched a successful franchise.The special effects are a little dated at this point, but it isn't bad enough to pull you out of the movie. The animatronics and puppets are obvious but cool to watch. While on the topic of ""dated"", it is kind of amusing to see this movie take place surrounded by 80's style (that's some BIG hair). The film is loaded with plenty of action but it does slow down a bit after the first half when the audience is treated to the bulk of the movie's exposition. Linda Hamilton is awesome as Sarah Connor, target for termination, and has good on-screen chemistry with Michael Biehn. The only real weak spot (which isn't even really worth mentioning) in the movie was Bill Paxton in the opening as the leader of a punk gang. As minor as his role is, for some reason, he always makes me cringe. For some reason, he just aggravates me in this movie. Of course, he's only on screen for two minutes and his role means near to nothing, so ignore my rant.The movie does have a couple plot holes, but only if you feel like feeding a headache with thoughts of time travel mechanics. Most people don't, so it doesn't matter. The movie is a fun popcorn flick and spawned two sequels.

No, not that Sarah Connor lives in the painful New Wave 1980s with her brainless, bighair girlfriend, not that the Terminator has no eyebrows, not even that lame Brad Fiedel soundtrack that sounds like Oingo without the Boingo - writer-director Cameron artfully dodges the time paradox flaw created simply by sending the Terminator back through time in the first place.You see, if the Terminator succeeds in killing Sarah, she will not birth the leader of the revolution, therefore the Terminator would have no reason to come back and kill her. Ergo, Terminator ceases to exist in 1984. On the other hand, if the Terminator fails to kill Sarah, it must mean the Terminator itself was terminated (for nothing else could make it fail). Either way, the Terminator ceases to exist. Good thing he's just a killing machine with no emotions, i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger.And how effective was John Connor's resistance anyway, that the machines felt threatened enough to kill his mother so that he wouldn't be born? From Reese's apocalyptic flashbacks, human extermination seems to be going quite well for the machines, with Reese and his pals living like rats in sewers, bedraggled and bitchbeaten.And hey! Has anyone stopped to consider that in 2029, they have Time Machines?! - that actually work! So why didn't humans send someone back to pull the plug on the machines taking over in the first place? These anomalies are explained feverishly by Reese to policemen Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen. But nobody's buying it. Especially not the fey police psychiatrist who looks like he took time off from molesting children to question Reese.Both Reese and the Terminator track Sarah Connor to an embarrassing dance club called Tech Noir, spewing the lamest disco possible to represent that era, the female vocals seemingly stuck on the lyric, ""You've got me burning'!,"" pony-stepping whitebread patrons looking like honky refugees from a Pat Benatar video.After the shooting starts, Reese utters one of Terminator-dom's magic lines to Sarah, ""Come with me if you want to live!"" This is also the movie where Schwarzenegger coins, ""I'll be back!"" In this perfect role for someone with no command of the English language, of his seventeen lines of dialog, these three words would become Arnold's catch-cry forever.And he does come back - again and again, in mighty action sequences where he is gunned down, run over, exploded, yet relentlessly recovering and pursuing Sarah, unstoppable, Reese forever warding off the attacks. Reese tells Sarah: ""...it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear"" (he's right - seen PUMPING IRON?) ""It absolutely will not stop until you are dead."" While they hide out in a roach motel, Reese puts his future-moves on Sarah, calling her a Legend and strong and brave and anything else guaranteed to moisten her man-jeans. And a pick-up line almost as good as the HIGHLANDER'S move of stabbing himself to bed Roxanne Hart: Reese gravel-whispers, ""I've memorized every line on your face. I came across time for you, Sarah. I love you. I always have."" Cue porn music, nakedness, future sperm... and Linda Hamilton getting her banana teats out for The '80s Love Scene, while looking like a man who's having a hard time turning a socket wrench. The thought surely must have crossed Reese's mind as he saw them bananas, ""Boy, Legends are easy. Comedy is hard."" And then Cameron makes an excellent character move - something which no one would dream of making in later Arnold movies after his star had risen to major box-office draw - he terminates Arnold! The flesh is seared off the Terminator in the last act and we see only the steel machine-man endoskeleton (created by legendary Stan Winston) pursue Sarah. This plot development, though robbing Arnold of screen time, drove home the Terminator's relentlessness; how it would literally stop at nothing, not even its flesh coming off, to complete its deadly mission. These are some of the most terrifying sequences of this modern technological horror tale, clinical, un-human; as Reese's warnings come to metal stop-motion fruition: ""...It can't be bargained with, can't be reasoned with...""The dicey closeups of Arnold's prosthetic head nearly land this movie in the B-Movie crap heap, though - but we forgive Cameron and Winston; best anyone could do pre-CGI, without selling their soul to George Lucas.Though the Terminator failed in its mission - leaving the future of mankind in the hands of a semi-bighaired, man-faced eighties chick - with the box office grosses nearly hitting the movie's filming budget on its opening weekend, we can be sure of at least one thing: He'll be back.",The Terminator

136,KUAlum26,Picture anyone else as the titular HK. Just try it.,9,12 January 2007,"CAn't do it,can you? That's how indelible Arnold Schwazenegger is as the title character,a perfectly made HK(Hunter KIller)android who has been sent from the future to eliminate the would-be mother of humanity's fiercest rebel and last true hope. Fortunately for the heroine of this show,SArah Connor(LInda Hamilton,before she beefed into the tough-chick she'd be type cast as AFTER T2,and probably best remembered as a similar,somewhat weaker type character in previous films like TAG and Children of the Corn),said machine has had to waste his way through Los Angeles to find her,so this buys her some time while one Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn,whose career has never completely up-turned since Aliens)also from the future,goes in pursuit of the 'droid AND protect Sarah,thus ensuring the birth of humanity's hero,one John Connor,and protecting humankind's future. As the droid draws nearer and nearer to Sarah and Kyle,and the body count rises,an adrenaline-pumping,gut-wrenching battle between Man's last best hope and a killing machine who""has no pity,no conscience,cannot be bargained with and will not stop until it finds and terminates its target(I'm paraphrasing here somewhat)"" chugs toward fruition.I learned not too long ago that director and co-writer James Cameron had NOT planned a sequel(let alone a trilogy or series)of this film and intended it to be a singular ending. Looking back at it as a whole product,it makes more sense(and that's all I'm saying from there so as to avoid any spoilers for those out there who HAVEN'T seen this film or aren't at least familiar with it). I can both understand why this film was only a marginal success when it was first released in late Fall/early Winter 1984: much of the cast were somewhat unknowns at the time,save Paul Warfield(As a doubting yet humane cop) and,of course,bodybuilding champ Schwarzenegger,and the concepts and images of the film were pure Sci-Fi,which always seems to be a bit of a hard sell to the general public. But much like another movie released around the same time,A Nightmare on Elm Street,it was a fairly unique and inexorably memorable movie that was bound to not only have sequels made but practically change the face of the genres they were made in. It's sequels are both well made(and I actually appreciated the whole size and scope of it's 1991 sequel,T2;Judgement Day somewhat better,the best of all three),and I intend to catch the next in the series,should it be made. Since Arnold vowed he was not doing any more movies as long as he's in public office,that could be a while. Still,it took almost twenty years to continue the simple storyline of man's battle with machines who've become far too powerful over just THREE movies,so what's another twenty years? It very well may be back.",The Terminator
137,capkronos,"Iconic, suspenseful action / sci-fi / horror film.",8,26 August 2014,"""The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present. Tonight..."" Earth's future is a grim one where the landscape is a wasteland and our own technology has backfired and created super-intelligent cyborgs and machines capable of thinking on their own and who've all but taken over the planet. In fact, by 2027 the world looks like one huge junkyard where aircraft fire purple and blue lasers into the night sky and large tanks roll around crushing scrap metal and skulls. The last surviving humans on the planet are in the midst of a losing war, but find a savior in John Connor, who will eventually save mankind. Unfortunately, the machinery have also managed to master the form of time travel and thus have another trick up their sleeve to prevent John from even coming into this world.A naked, muscular man (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his star-making role) suddenly appears out of nowhere in a flash of lightning somewhere in Los Angeles, present day. First things first, he needs some clothes and gets them from a trio of punks after sending his fist all the way through one of them. Then it's off to pawn shop to load up on shotguns, Uzis and ammo. No need to pay: just shoot the clerk. From there, a quick glance at the phone book reveals there are three Sarah Connor's living in the city and, since this man isn't actually a man at all but an emotionless humanoid cyborg sent there with one goal in mind, he gets to work hunting each of the ladies down and exterminating them, for one is the future mother of John Connor. Appearing somewhere else in L.A. is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn); a flesh-and-blood human this time, and a good guy, who's there to try to prevent the Terminator from accomplishing his goal.After quickly dispatching the first two Sarah's and numerous other people who get in the way, the terminator finally manages to track down the third - and correct - Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in a club at about the same time as Kyle. Kyle manages to get her out of there in one piece (can't say the same for many of the other patrons) and from then on out it's an action-packed, fast-paced pursuit through the city with car chases, shootouts and explosions aplenty as our heroes try to think of a way to kill an unstoppable killing machine that seems impervious to most kinds of conventional weaponry. One of the best sequences is when the terminator shoots up dozens of cops at a police station, which also happens to contain the famous line ""I'll be back."" Seeing this movie first as a kid in the late 80s and now again as an adult, I can say it's held up well over the years thanks to strong storytelling and despite any advances in fx technology.Made on a budget of just 6.4 million dollars, the film became one of the year's surprise hits; grossing 38 million in the U.S. alone (nearly 80 million worldwide). Though that doesn't seem like a whole lot nowadays, the film's reputation grew throughout the decade and by the time Cameron returned with T2 in 1991, the budget had skyrocketed to 100+ million and the film grossed double that, making it the #1 box office draw of its year. TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003) boasted a price tag somewhere between 170 and 200 million dollars and did better overseas than in the U.S. Ditto for the Schwarzenegger-free, 200-million-budgeted TERMINATOR SALVATION (2009). There was also the TV series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,"" which lasted two seasons, and an upcoming fifth film in the franchise is coming in 2015.Because the screenplay shared numerous ideas from several Harlan Ellison stories, the author ended up suing. It was settled out of court and Ellison received a special thanks acknowledgment in the end credits.",The Terminator
138,blumdeluxe,Solid but not more,6,16 January 2019,"""The Terminator"" tells the story of a killing machine that was sent into present times by other machines in their war against humanity in order to kill the mother of the leader of the human rebellion. Unprepared, the young woman has to fight for her life side to side with a friend of her future son to save the future of humankind.The film was a bit more serious than I feared it would be, it has elements of a dystopia and some kind of theory for the background of the plot, even if that is not always brilliantly thought-through. For this reason it doesn't exclusively consist of action, which is a definite plus. The effects aged rather well and even today don't look embarassing. Unfortunately I have to say that in terms of plot and dramaturgy the film is at best mediocre. What it tells is more or less an episode, like a scene of a movie that is enlarged into a whole production. That leads to a Terminator that has so many lives that it is on the edge of being ridiculous. I would have loved to see a bit more background and future times rather than fighting sequences that don't take an end.All in all this isn't just a movie of action and destruction, even though many scenes include both. Through solid acting and a somewhat consistent story it becomes an okay film that aged rather well and is widely considered a classic.",The Terminator
139,oneguyrambling,A film that demands Exclamation Points!!,8,8 April 2011,"It's hard to believe that the original Terminator film was James Cameron's first big budget Hollywood effort, well unless you count Piranha 2: The Spawning.As I do.While hundreds of 80s films now gather dust in cupboards and shelves across the planet housed neatly in brittle plastic VHS boxes – guys throw them out, it's not coming back! – some films carry on to be repackaged and repurchased in ever more pointless formats and editions. Check out the ""We mean it this time; Ultimate Edition"", or my favourite (and 100% real): TOTAL RECALL – Single Disc Edition!! Suffer all those guys who foolishly bought the 2 disc version. Losers! So I think by now with the prequels, sequels, threequels and nyquils that two visitors from the future are sent back to change or preserve the future, depending on what side you're on.The first is about 6 foot 5, nude and built like a heart with a head and legs, and when he asks you for your clothes just give 'em to him, it will lengthen your life expectancy.The second guy is an average guy that just seems skinny and scrawny by comparison to the living tissue over metal exoskeleton guy, that may be because he isn't 85% titanium and doesn't have a CPU in his head, or it may be because Michael Beihn went to acting lessons instead of the gym I guess we'll never know.Now the second guy is the good guy, his name is Kyle Reese, he knows the son of the woman targeted for termination by the other big metal guy, despite the fact that she isn't yet a mother – or even pregnant. That chickie is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), and she works happily in a local fast food restaurant and lives with her ditzy flatmate and a giant lizard Wait, wait, wait Wait.WAIT! None of this is important. What matters is just how cool all of this was then, and remarkably how cool it still is over 25 years later.The makeup effects on the damaged T1000 (Arnie as the bad-robot) are awesome, and you totally forgive the fact that in a couple scenes it is obviously an animatronic head when you realise that it still looks really cool. Other scenes though that are definitely Arnold and you could swallow the fact that half his face is peeled off and he is filled with metal. The use of flashbacks – which are actually flashforwards to the future – are all realised spectacularly, especially when you understand just how low the budget was and how low-tech some of the tricks they used at the time (Yes I watched the special features), and once Arnie the exterior is gone and the shiny and gleaming robot version of him mercilessly and relentlessly continues its dogged pursuit of Connor it is still awe-inspiring.All this before I even mention that the guy teased for being so robotic through his career is actually playing the robot. Arnie must have loved this role, they actually told him to be more wooden than normal, so instead of long speeches and pages of dialogue he gets to spit out maybe 15 lines of dialogue in the whole film and one of them turned out to be his own personal catchphrase even though James Cameron wrote it for him! Well I'm out of exclamation points, suffice to say if you're hanging around waiting for the next Alien Vs Predator, or you're lamenting how The Expendables just wasn't that rocking and you haven't seen The Terminator? Arise Sir Knight and head immediately to the video store (if it still exists) post-haste to rectify your oversight.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. A pretty simple story is laid out over an elaborate framework, then given a brilliant backstory. Add some superior SFX and a mono-syllabic Austrian bodybuilder and you've got yourself a timeless classic.",The Terminator
140,xredgarnetx,Scary sci-fi,7,30 April 2007,"I first saw TERMINATOR on a hotel room TV in Washington, D.C., with my wife and young daughter. I would say the film thrilled the heck out of us and probably scared my kid half to death, but the fact is, we were in a brightly lit hotel room and the TV wasn't particularly large. I know we were bowled over by the police station sequence and the final chase at the very least. This is one of Ah-nuld's best roles, and director James Cameron knows how to keep things moving along on a shoestring budget. The scene where Ah-nuld must deal with a partially ruined face is unforgettable. T2 came along a few years later and put the original to shame, much like ALIENS did to ALIEN. But if it were not for THE TERMINATOR, where would we be today?

From the minute you see Arnold Swartzenegger on the screen, you know he was on roids.The other films I don't think he was. I don't like this one as much because I prefer the liquid guy as a villain over him. Arnold Swatzenegger isn't meant to be playing a villain in a film. He's always the hero.

143,Jeremy_Urquhart,A film that reworks its limitations into its strengths,8,28 September 2021,"I do really love how Cameron takes what would usually be limitations and turns them into strengths.Physically intimidating actor with limited range and a monotone voice in Arnold Schwarzenegger? Cast him as an emotionless, ruthless cyborg who only wants to kill.Low budget and limited scale? Shoot action scenes at night and utilise a wide range of sometimes limited but always creative effects for those set pieces.Story about the fate of humanity, and the world being wiped out by machines made on said low budget? Tell a smaller story with a small cast, and provide an insight into that bigger story with a few short flash forwards and through dialogue.The execution isn't always perfect, but it's usually pretty great, and the first Terminator does wonders with what it had to work with, and Cameron's screenplay is strong and doesn't waste a second. My score for this would float somewhere between a 4 and a 4.5, but I'm rounding down because I'm an asshole.From memory I do slightly prefer Terminator 2, so I look forward to also rewatching that soon.",The Terminator
144,baumer,Nice night for a walk.,10,15 July 1999,"Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies "" Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again. ""  That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One, this is the first film where ""I'll be back"" was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he's in.  Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.A great film.",The Terminator

150,hnt_dnl,A real masterpiece,10,22 March 2010,"Recently, I was listening to a discussion about filmmakers and the person leading the talk explained why he thinks that their best films (even the best directors) are usually their first ones or early ones and the explanation was amazingly simple...It boils down to this...""The director has his/her personal vision that they've always wanted to translate to the screen, the studios don't really know what to make of the film b/c it's so original, so they take a chance thinking the director will tank, but then the film's originality wins out."" With minimal studio involvement or interference, a filmmaker with a great idea that is perfectly executed can put out a masterpiece straight away...And that's what James Cameron did with THE TERMINATOR! THE TERMINATOR (1984) is one of Cameron's earliest films, and to me, it is still to this day his BEST film! I hear and read all the time of so many people fawning all over T2:JUDGMENT DAY as being superior to the original TERMINATOR, but I cannot disagree more. T2 is essentially a a loud summer ""action"" movie with great effects and one-dimensional characters, whereas the original TERMINATOR is an amalgamation of sci-fi, horror, action (yes, there is that!), and is very forward-thinking in its premise: it dares to forewarn us about a bleak, apocalyptic future in a rather unsettling, plausible way. The way that THE TERMINATOR presents itself really does scare the heck out of me! I personally don't think any of Cameron's other films (including the heavily overrated ALIENS and T2) are in the vicinity of greatness that THE TERMINATOR is.THE TERMINATOR stars the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger in perhaps his greatest film performance. You can tell a performance is great when it still holds up after 20+ years! Schwarzenegger is truly confident, convincing, and terrifying as the T800, a killing machine from the future (2029) tasked to kill ""The Mother of the Future"" Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton in a heartbreaking and powerful performance). Sarah is to be the mother of John Connor, the leader of the future resistance. John sends back one of his soldiers Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn in a provocative, convincing performance). Both Biehn and Schwarzenegger's characters truly come off as ""otherwordly"", with no interest or use for the present day foibles and nonsense. These actors' authenticity as futuristic beings make THE TERMINATOR more than the typical sci-fi fare. To this day, I say that these 3 underrated performances of Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Biehn, are among the best in the sci-fi genre.In addition to THE TERMINATOR having so much going for it as a multi-genre film, another thing I love about this over the sequels is that we actually don't see the pivotal character of John Connor. Of course, since he is still in the future, we can't see him, but it keeps the character a larger-than-life that we actually don't see him. Another big plus is that in addition to the main 3 actors, the supporting cast is exceptional: Paul Winfield as the skeptical police Lt. Traxler, Lance Henriksen as his wisecracking detective sidekick, and most notably Earl Boen as psychiatrist Dr. Silberman, who is equally fascinated and mocking of Reese's story of an apocalyptic future.As previously mentioned, Cameron impressively mixes several genres well into this groundbreaking film. It spawned a lot of wannabes and you can see the influence on some of the later big 80s sci-fi movies like ALIENS, ROBOCOP, and THE HIDDEN. But THE TERMINATOR. But this film has an added ""bonus"" of helplessness and hopelessness that permeates throughout. If Sarah Connor dies, then supposedly machines will take over the world. If Sarah Connor lives, then the world has a bleak future ahead of it fighting said machines.The last (and most important!) ingredient that makes THE TERMINATOR superior to it's sequels is in the title character. I'm actually a monumental fan of Schwarzenegger and most of his movies, and although he went the traditional action star route cashing in on his star-making role here (Cameron even made Arnie the ""good guy"" terminator in the sequels!), he can claim to bringing to the screen the most terrifying, remorseless killing machine in the history of cinema!",The Terminator
151,hall895,Good? Yes. Great? Hmmmmm...,7,9 November 2010,"Is it heresy to suggest that The Terminator may be a tad overrated? That perhaps fans who so love the whole Terminator saga and mythology remember the original film as being a little better than it actually was? This low budget sci-fi action thriller is certainly an enjoyable film. And considering the franchise it spawned and all the other films it so obviously influenced it's also an important film. But does that necessarily make it a truly great film? Probably not. It's a good film, very good in spots, but there are enough things holding it back to leave it a touch shy of greatness.By now most everyone knows the film's story so a plot rehash seems rather unnecessary. In a nutshell a cyborg Terminator is sent back from the future to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of the as yet unborn human resistance leader who in that post-apocalyptic future will lead the fight against the machines which seek to exterminate humanity. Convoluted? You bet. Of course the Terminator has not come from the future alone. Human resistance fighter Kyle Reese has been sent back to protect Sarah. He must stop the unstoppable Terminator. Good luck with that. Shootouts and car chases and explosions ensue. Plot? Story? Dialogue? Sorry, don't have much for you here. But have I mentioned the explosions? Everyone likes seeing things get blown up right?As I've implied, after the story initially sets itself up there really isn't much of a story at all. The whole movie is one big chase. Certainly there are moments of great excitement but in between the big moments...well there's often not much. At times things are rather sluggish. But there's enough good stuff here to make this at least an enjoyable flick if not some kind of all-time classic film. Of course there are some very memorable characters starting with the Terminator himself (itself?), played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. As a stiff, robotic, inhuman, largely mute killing machine Schwarzenegger's perfect. I'm not sure if that says much for Schwarzenegger's acting ability but for this role in this movie who could be better? The Terminator doesn't have much to say but whenever he does speak you remember it. Seriously, it seems every line Arnold speaks in the movie turned into a catchphrase. Sarah Connor is a character who undergoes a serious evolution in the course of the film and Linda Hamilton portrays that wonderfully. From the sweet, innocent girl at the film's beginning to something else entirely by film's end Hamilton traces the character's journey terrifically. Schwarzenegger and Hamilton are remembered best but it may actually be Michael Biehn who gives the best performance of all as Kyle Reese. It is left to his character to explain to Sarah, and by extension to us, what the heck this movie is actually about. No small task that, making a truly preposterous, unbelievable story sound convincing. Now if you stop and think about that story you will realize there are plot holes large enough to drive an exploding tanker truck through. Time travel stories have their own peculiar issues. Paradoxes and all that. And this film's got a doozy of a paradox. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Even if it's not truly as great as it is generally remembered to be what it is ain't bad at all.",The Terminator
152,vip_ebriega,Those men and their killing machines.,8,13 July 2008,"My Take: Revolutionary for its storytelling and influences to the genre. Highly regarded as one of the best sci-fi films of all time, James Cameron's brainchild THE TERMINATOR, released in 1984, has severely suffered a sort of dated feel. Suffering in comparison to the ever-advancing technology, the special effects and make-up have dated real badly from the low-tech technology available at the 80's to today. But in its heart, THE TERMINATOR still holds true with its story and anti-war message that still holds truth and never is too preachy, in fact not at all. THE TERMINATOR may not be the place to locate revolutionary special effects and action scenes, but it's in the writing department where the true heart of the film lies, as is its success. Arnold Schwarzenegger is still one of the creepiest bad guys around as the cold, emotionless cyborg from the violent future sen back to modern 1984 to kill a woman (Linda Hamilton) who will spawn a son who will lead humanity against a rebellion against war-machines in a futuristic war. Michael Biehn has gone surprisingly out of steam as a hero, so is Hamilton's character who rarely does anything more than play second-bananas. But THE TERMINATOR still holds a story and some key moments to hold its audiences. In other words, it still is a classic remnant of its age, an age where writing goes first above effects and star players.Rating: **** out of 5.",The Terminator
153,fmarkland32,Targeted for termination...,10,12 June 2006,"Arnold Scwarzenegger stars as a cyborg sent back to 1984 to wipe out Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) due to her giving birth to what will be the savior of mankind in the future. I remember seeing this back when I was 11 back when kids could get into R rated action movies without an ID. I saw this movie and I realized that my mom would have killed me if she would have known what I had been watching in the theater playing this movie. I was used to the R rated blood lust from various Friday The 13th movies and therefore I had walked out of theaters with my friends in an uproar over the carnage. Not this time, my friends and I walked out as if we had seen the goriest snuff film ever made. However I don't want to give off the impression that this was a bad feeling, indeed we went back the next day to see it again! We would feel the same way after seeing Aliens. The Terminator though was unlike anything we had ever seen, the pace was brutal and the action sequences were frightening in their intensity. The police station massacre and indeed even the opening scene set the tone for one of the greatest epics ever saw. It's an awesome movie. It really is. * * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",The Terminator
154,one9eighty,An absolute game changer for Sci-Fi action,10,12 February 2020,"This is an absolute classic and it's a film that not only started a franchise, but spawned a concept that's spilled into all areas of modern cultural entertainment, let alone other movies.In the future, machines are the dominant force on earth. Human kind has practically been wiped out, all apart from small cells of freedom fighters and rebels, who all follow the lead of John Connor - an almost prophetic guerrilla leader who's standing up to the machines. To change the course of the human/ machine war, an assassin robot is sent back in time to kill the unborn leader's mother before he can be born and have any impact on the war. In order to counter this, and make sure that John Connor is born, a freedom fighter is also sent back in time, to stop the assassin robot. This is where things get tricky, certain actions from either machine or man could detrimentally affect the future and have a butterfly effect on the way things turn out - the future may not end up being the future while the past is in flux. Does that make sense?? (I tried explaining this to a friend in the early 90's and it just garnered blank expressions!).I'll start by saying that cast in this film is absolutely brilliant, everyone delivers a top class performance, for some people this film elevated them to superstar status allowing them to choose better movies that they may have previously had. The standout star in this film is undoubtedly Arnold Schwarzenegger. While he only had a few lines in the film that's all he actually needed as his mannerisms and demeanour are enough to portray brick-wall dominance and violence. It's probably fair to say that had he been given more lines, then this film may have been slightly spoiled, his English accent at the time wasn't brilliant, and the use of little dialogue lends well to portraying an emotionless machine intent on bringing death. Props also need to go to Michael Biehn, who acts as the story teller and the vehicle for the films pace, he's the freedom fighter sent from the future to protect Linda Hamilton's character, who is going to be the mother of the human resistance. A lot of people really got their big break here, from Arnie, to Biehn, Hamilton, even the likes of Bill Paxton and Lance Henrikson - some of who, carried on their relationship with directory Cameron in other movies.The look and feel of the film, the cinematography is splendid. Mainly filmed at night or in dark locations, set in urban areas, this really films like a dark and moody film. There are flashbacks (or flash forwards as it's from the future), that juxtapose the urban landscape with the warzone future that's yet to come. The CGI and special effects in the film are fantastic, while they look slightly dated now in places, at the time these were revolutionary and haunting. James Cameron does a brilliant job knitting together a great story with a top cast, great effects and fantastic visuals. Breaking the mould and making Sci-Fi bigger and better than ever, bringing the future to your current existence (while previous sci-fi classics have usually looked at being in the future already, or even space exploration) this almost smart but lethal, almost Orwellian, action chase film is an absolute masterpiece, and it's easy to see why, despite being low budget, it broke so many records and conventions - and spawned sequels, prequels, comics, TV series, as well as inspiring other parts of modern entertainment. Easily one of my favourite films of all time 10 out of 10.",The Terminator
155,educallejero,Organic and well made action movie,6,7 November 2019,"I feel the best thing they did with this one is Linda Hamilton's character, Sarah Connor. They really take their time into making her slowly accept and learns from the crazy situation she finds herself in. Linda is absolutely perfect in the role, and we see a transformation from a normal girl that wanted to have dates to a survivor. Also, the relationship with her protector from the future is also well done. She makes it work, because Michael Biehn absolutely sucks.In that sense, the movie lacks acting quality besides Linda Hamilton (which wasn't amazing, but great for the role). Even Arnold doesn't quite nail the ""machine from the future"", in my opinion.The dialogue is awful. Most of the time is terrible exposition, but is also bad when helps the characterization of our leads.But that doesn't matter that much, because it is a pure action/sci-fi movie. The ending ties it all up, and even if the action gets a bit repetitive for me, it still good.",The Terminator
156,Stampsfightclub,Dynamic exploration of time and action,9,3 April 2010,"A Terminator model from the future is sent to 1984 to assassinate Sarah Connor (Hamilton) and her only protection comes from Reece (Biehn) a soldier from the future.James Cameron's sharp science fiction masterstroke has lived long through its 26 years and has spurned many sequels and parodies that have never matched the true quality of what hit us hard in the mid 1980's.At a time travel state of media hype with Doctor Who, Bill and Ted amongst others The Terminator lived strongest through the 80's thanks to its bravado impersonal bad guy in Arnold Schwarzenegger and through a plot Cameron devised that has a strong action intrusion that battles significant issues like human survival and the relativity of humanity in adversity.Opening with some flashing lights and naked men you may wonder what you've flicked on but all becomes clear after the hour when the true meaning of robots and the future is conversed and analysed and up until then its none stop intrigue through these bizarre protagonists hunting down a Sarah Connor.Cameron shoots in a way that gives the film a thrilling edge between the two characters of the Terminator and Kyle Reese and as of their violent actions trouble ensues and the viewer watching for the first time will be enticed into a gripping mode of adrenaline to see who reaches her first, and to what purpose.Cameron, a man who once again smashed records with Avatar last Christmas launched into the film world with this film and to many, he has never bettered this bravado showcase of action adrenaline.Scripting this as well, Cameron brings a new dimension to entertainment through his choice of settings and plot depictions of time and humanity. The final scene in the work place is bravado action excitement with a seemingly never ending fight sequence that generates as much excitement as the first few minutes, showing a good consistency to his works.Schwarzenegger as many know him at his best gives a wonderfully unemotional and perfectly inhumane performance as the evil Terminator and using very minimal dialogue has created an icon that can only be mimicked.Linda Hamilton in her most famous on screen performance braves the ordinary into the supernatural role perfectly with the right appreciation of panic and naivety to what is around her. Michael Biehn is wonderfully used as a frustrate figure of responsibility and as a saviour that gives the film a great balance of strong action with powerful dramatic implications.Whilst there have been 3 sequels thus far and with a fifth in the offing, the story is far from over but with this originality and excellent appreciation of time consequence and action direction, will this picture ever be topped?",The Terminator
157,DarthBill,The kind of film that aspiring screen writers of today wish they had thought of first...,10,7 April 2004,"When James Cameron finally got the Terminator made, the studio refused to advertise it as a ""science fiction film"", which puzzled Cameron. When he asked why, they said it didn't count as science fiction because it wasn't set in outer space like Star Trek and Star Wars. Jim shot back that it was science fiction because it dealt with time travel and cyborgs. This was significant for science fiction film making because, as much fun as those out of this world galaxies are, science fiction can still be compelling when set on Earth. The film also made a star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, technically ""Conan the Barbarian"" did that, but ""Terminator"" helped him break out of costume films and get into the shoot 'em ups.Arnold plays the title character, a robot in human skin sent back to 1984 LA to kill Sarah Connor (a 28 year old Linda Hamilton with her hair dyed dirty blond), a good natured but lonely, somewhat scatter-brained, hapless waitress who has no idea of just how important she really is: she's the mother of John Connor, the man who will save what's left of the human race in the year 2019 when the machines have almost succeeded in taking over the world. Sarah's only hope is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, who later starred in James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss""), a soldier sent back from the future to protect her from the Terminator. Chaos and mayhem ensue, along with a high body count and the unexpected love story between Sarah & Kyle, the latter who turns out to be John Connor's father. Oh the irony of Kyle's response to Sarah's question about John's father: ""John never said much about him... I know he dies before the war.""Yes, some of the special effects are dated (namely the puppet head used for the scene where the Terminator cuts out its damaged eye and a few of the stop motion effects) and it's set in its era and it kind of runs out of steam towards the end, but the rest of the film is great: it's dark, it's eerie, it's seamy, it's atmospheric, it's violent, it's got pretty much everything. Arnold dominates pretty much every scene he's in. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are sympathetic protagonists.Personally, I like this one better than the sequels, possibly because there's no Edward Furlong in it. The big difference between the films is that the original was more of a thriller, an extended chase scene, whereas the sequels were more about style and special effects and blow you away action sequences. But it's all good in the end. This is also a great examination of what could happen should technology get out of hand, ala ""Blade Runner"".The DVD has two options of sound effects, the old mono system and a newer, more sophisticated one. I highly advise you not to listen to the newer sound system because it makes everything in the film sound really fake. The DVD also has deleted scenes, mostly notably a scene where Reese suffers an emotional break down over being displaced in time, an angle that never surfaced in the film but would have been very interesting to bring up.""I'll be back.""",The Terminator
158,stamper,Great classic,8,9 October 2001,"This is truly a great film, which of course is always somehow compared with part two, just as part two is always compared to this one. Sure this one has it's advantages over the second one, but it also is a bit worse at times. But those times are not as frequent or as important as the many times it has advantages over the second installment, because everything that is worse in this film, over the second one has to do with special effects. Now listen closely, the effects are not bad, they are as good as they were in 1984, but they just are not as good as the effects in 1991 and that is it. Regarding the rest of the film, it sure as hell is somewhat better than the sequel. First of all, everything in this film is more original and fresh (because it is a first of course), but not only that. One thing I like a bit more in this film, is that it is darker you know, more mechanic and inhuman. You really get a sense here of the fact that you are dealing with an emotionless machine. All this dark sphere that is created must be ascribed mainly to James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. James Cameron, of course for his vision and execution of the way he felt the music and the sets had to be and Schwarzenegger for his good performance. I know that many people may well argue about my last statement: 'Good performance, Schwarzenegger can't play CRAP!' Well in terms of great character roles or dramatic ones this might all be very true, but in this film Schwarzenegger captured everything his character was about perfectly. You might say he didn't have to act at all. But you go ahead, try to pass as a machine in a movie, kill emotionless, walk static, look grim, speak slowly and well 'machinery' (cut off). All of this enables the viewer to totally believe that he is indeed a machine.
The other actors here are not to be forgotten either, Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor are also very well characterized by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton respectively. I mean they very believable and they have a good chemistry in the film. They are also the characters seen in the best parts of the film (not the coolest, that's what Schwarzenegger is for). My favorite scenes in this movie certainly are the 'intimate scene' and the 1st 2029 A.D. scene with the epilogue at the beginning. All in all I must say that this is a masterpiece of cinema and a must see for everyone who love movies.

159,tbills2,Mankind vs. Machines,8,17 January 2014,"James Cameron's The Terminator is an excellent of a start to an epic sci-fi saga. The Terminator is Cameron's first major film, and he couldn't of done any better. The Terminator is an all-around better sci-fi action film equipped with great direction, brilliant storytelling, and high caliber acting from Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and, of course, Arnold. Arnold. Arnold. That's right, use your Austrian accent. Arnold. I love, Arnold. Arnold, Schwarzenegger was the strongest selection on planet Earth to become the Terminator. Arnold is the Terminator. The Terminator launches Schwarzenegger's career into unprecedented superstardom. The Terminator is Schwarzenegger's most iconic role. ""I'll be back."" Linda Hamilton, too, is literally the best woman in the world to be Sarah Conner. She was born to play Sarah, and she has earned it. Michael Biehn has the star strength of a soldier. Biehn's tough to replace as Kyle Reese, the man sent back in time 50 years from the future on a succeed at all costs mission to protect Sarah Connor, the mother of her unborn child, John Connor, who is the leader of the human resistance against the machines far into the future, and yep, you guessed it, the machines sent back Arnold the Terminator to Sarah Connor's time to hunt her and kill her. The Terminator has a timeless battle of resourceful human soldier, Kyle Reese, vs. unstoppable killing machine, the Terminator. The Terminator has an innovative and groundbreaking story for its time. The Terminator is high conceptual cinema that's powerfully dramatic and happens to be a bit scary at times. Bill Paxton plays his role for the time making for more classic Cameron. One thing that really makes the Terminator special, that you wouldn't have known at the time, is that its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is one of the all-time 50 best movies, and easily in the conversation of being the best sci-fi fantasy adventure, along with a few other Cameron greats, like Avatar, Aliens and The Abyss. T2 improves in all the right areas where T1 is minorly lacking. The Terminator very much feels like one extended and incomplete preview, yet, outstanding outing of the soon to be conceived and released, T2. I love The Terminator story, and I'm a big fan of all of the Terminator movies, especially T2. Arnold. ""I'll be back.""",The Terminator
160,ivo-cobra8,Schwarzenegger's my personal favorite best action classic masterpiece of all time,10,5 January 2018,"The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead! ""This is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.Two naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.James Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.Brad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences, car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film: Photoplay 
 and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero, but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough. Before Sarah Connor was a tough bad-ass gun guerilla squad in the sequels, here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic, brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.Michael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being. Lance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.Paul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun. This movie has ton's of action: You see a lot of automatic weapons, shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.When we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah. The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.10/10 Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film, a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is Schwarzenegger's best film with Predator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day I highly recommend those three films.",The Terminator
161,juliankennedy23,Determinator,10,3 September 2018,"The Terminator: 10 out of 10: Time travel meets a future dystopia meets eighties hair in one of the best B-movies ever made. Considering this was directed by a guy whose only film at the time was Piranha 2 the Spawning.it seems like a miracle.The Good: Repeat viewings will clue one in on a couple of things. For starters, this is a tightly made film with great pacing and foreshadowing. Little things (Arnie running over a toy truck in one of the first scenes as an example call back to themes and scenes later in the film.) The film is so well paced that when it turns it up to eleven (Police station natch) the surprise in genuine and in-universe.There is also a surprisingly successful time travel romance film. It handles the conundrum of time travel much better than many films for whom time travel is their raison d'être. Despite some occasionally clunky dialogue, the romance between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn really works. One can imagine that film sans the whole end of the world unstoppable Terminator part. (As an aside Gene Siskel in his review of the movie said as much wishing they had dumped the Arnie character and concentrated on these two kids. Roger Ebert for the record disagreed).The Bad: Okay I love practical effects. You love practical effects. Let us be honest the Terminator in the first film goes a little skeleton from that Sinbad movie at the end. In addition, Arnie's mask/makeup when he is fixing his face makes him look a little too much like Michael Myers.The Ugly: Like Jaws and Die Hard, Terminator has spun off some subpar sequels and a ton of god awful ripoffs. Some of the original OMG factor is invariably lost with the familiarity of the plot and the sea of pretenders.In Conclusion: There is a scene early on in that wonderful eighties bar Tech Noir Where Linda Hamilton finally gets hold of the police and they tell her don't worry, stay in the crowd, and we have someone on the way. You will be safe. When I first watched the film I really believed that. The film kept selling me safety only to pull the rug out from under again and again. I have seen few films who have played that parlor trick any better. Not a cheap trick of the killer pretending to be dead but a real one of a truly relentless machine After all as Michael Biehn says ""That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!"" The sequels have lessened that message and blurred those lines. This film gets to the heart of it. It is an action film, a romance, a sci-fi thriller, but most of all it is a horror film about something that can't be stopped and where you are never truly safe. A great movie.",The Terminator
162,gab-14712,An Iconic Science Fiction Classic!,9,9 May 2020,"The Terminator is, without a doubt, one of the most iconic science-fiction movies of all-time. It may not be my favorite (it's still high up on my list), but there is no denying the influence the film had for filmmakers and moviegoers alike. The studio, Orion, originally saw this film as a flop, but it was moderately successful on a limited budget. It spawned a sequel that brought the property to a mass audience, which it turn created more sequels of varying degrees of success. Even in today's world, this is a beloved film that has a wide audience.The film brought forth the Hollywood careers of many people. The top of the list is director James Cameron. It took people time to see he was the real deal. With the tight budget given to him, Cameron was able to make most of what he had. His movie, which he also wrote, has some very dark themes. What will the world look like with the rapid acceleration of technology and what would happen if there was nuclear war? I think Cameron answers these questions very well, which may also be one of the reasons why the film resonates in the mind of viewers today.I love the look and the design of the movie. Most of the filming took place at night hence the darkness. The special effects may be outdated in today's terms, but keep in mind there was a small budget. Still, they are good enough to make the scenes believable. I still remember seeing The Terminator and Kyle Reese appear on screen, from the future, with those lightning bolts and Brad Fiedel's amazing theme. This could have been cheesy in the hands of a lesser director, but Cameron made it work. Unlike subsequent sequels, he made an incredibly wise choice to shoot the film like a horror thriller. Yeah, there are very intense, horrific moments here to behold. Those robots look really intense and scary.In the year 2029, the entire world has been conquered by manmade machines. These machines send a ruthless assassin, known as the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 Los Angeles, where his mission is to kill the person who holds the key to the future of mankind; Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). The human resistance sends one of their own, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to 1984 to stop the cyborg from completing his mission. The Terminator will not stop until his mission is complete and he will destroy anyone and anything that stands in his way.The acting can be clunky at times, but it works in everyone's favor. Despite the success of Conan the Barbarian, Cameron was hesitant in hiring Schwarzenegger. The casting worked out in everyone's favor though. He only had seventeen lines of dialogue and they were delivered in a robotic voice, which is, you know, perfect for a robot. His intimidation and presence are what makes his character so unique. When we are introduced to him, we see him go up against the dumb punk leader (played by a wonderful, young Bill Paxton) and give him a much-deserved beatdown. That is how we know Arnold was the right man. This is Michael Biehn's first big role and he has some great moments of dialogue. I was on the fence with Linda Hamilton. On one hand, her character irked me in the beginning. But as the movie progresses, I warmed up to her character and was rooting for her by the film's end. There are some solid supporting roles from Dick Miller and Lance Henriksen.The music is another reason why we are enthralled and captivated. This is Fiedel's first film score, and Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd almost passed on him due to his inexperience, but he was able to show them how talented he is. The synth score and those drums combine to create one of the most iconic scores of all time. Yep, it is something that you can easily hum.The success of The Terminator surprised everyone in 1984. Should it really considering the talent of the people behind the film? Science fiction was not big on Hollywood's mind despite the success of Alien and Star Wars. The genre will begin to make a comeback thanks to the aforementioned films and this one. James Cameron rose to the A-list director list and Schwarzenegger became a superstar and his line ""I'll be back"" is the line that everyone loves to imitate including myself. I really, really enjoyed this sci-fi action/horror flick. It is violent, has many great lines, zips along at a fast pace, and one of those films you will remember as an instant classic.My Grade: A",The Terminator

164,Angry_Arguer,Help saved sci-fi from Star Wars (spoilers),10,9 July 2002,"Terminator deserves an award for the impact it made to sci-fi--albeit good and bad.  Star Wars demolished the genre that Kubrick slaved to change, making space operas more important than thinking at the box office.  With Terminator we abandon droids, galactic empires, the Force, and all that other pissant elementary school dung and get down to business, pronto. Many films are hailed ""cool"", but intellectuals get their brains working and reject is as garbage.  Terminator is one movie that'll please both smart & stupid, the darkness gives the sense of evil everywhere while an electronic score enhances the feeling of man at the mercy of machines.  Arnold, limited actor he is, reigns king of deadpan brutality.  When he puts a shotgun shell in someone's chest or rips their heart out--he doesn't smile, frown, or flinch, his performance is robotic--AND IT WORKS! The nightmarish future scenes make Mad Max look like Teletubbies (interesting how many set pieces were reused in T2).  While the futuristic Hunter-Killers seem fake, their machined ruthlessness causes fear. The cyborgs slay like Judas, betraying our emotions into believing only what's human, then whipping out the laser cannon and perforating us. As in almost all his work, James Cameron has women become strong.  Little is spent worrying with that and more on the story--making it one of the best low budget movies that does a lot with little.  In a 150 MILLION dollar film, do they care where the cash goes?  No, and we spectators wind up with ""Wild Wild West"", ""Pearl Harbor"", and ""Waterworld"" (not bold moves for the studios)!  In a $6 million film like this, togetherness is key. WARNING!  DON'T CONTEMPLATE HOW TELEPORTING IN TIME TO CHANGE THE PAST IN ORDER TO SAVE THE FUTURE WORKS!!

The Terminator is incredibly atmospheric, with impressive special effects for the era and a menacing score. Schwarzenegger is perfectly utilised and could not be a better fit for the role. Linda Hamilton also gives a strong performance, developing rapidly and authentically from girl-next-door to cyborg-destroyer in a very short space of time. We also see one of the few sex scenes in a blockbuster film that has genuine feeling to it, resulting from a delicately engineered chemistry between Hamilton and Michael Biehn. Compared to the cluttered flamboyant action films that have preceded it, Terminator is clean, minimalist and unpretentious. A genuine classic.",The Terminator
166,fernandoschiavi,"""The Terminator"" is, without a doubt, a modern landmark in science fiction cinema and, why not, a cinematographic landmark independent of genres",8,21 May 2020,"""The Terminator"" is, without a doubt, a modern landmark in science fiction cinema and, why not, a cinematographic landmark independent of genres, alongside other works of the size of ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"", the classic ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Behind an unprecedented and even frightening concept - of a future dominated by machines - mainly if transported to the current reality in which technology increasingly assumes new roles in people's daily lives. The work of visionary James Cameron, who wrote the script alongside Gale Ann Hurd (another visionary) who was responsible for the final format of the work - there were two Terminators from the future, one made of liquid metal, which was cut to reduce costs and then famously reused in the sequel. This film was one of the first to present the perfect balance between action and pure science fiction (not fantasy as is the case with Star Wars), challenging definitions and the barriers of the genre. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates that creativity and inventiveness will always, under any circumstances, be able to overcome budget constraints.
The script is a master of narrative economy and deceptive simplicity. It is a masterpiece of efficiency to convey very interesting concepts about time travel and the resulting paradoxes. In the same way, without resorting to much exposure (some is necessary and inevitable), we learn details about the painful life of Kyle Reese (Biehn), soldier of the future who is sent to the past to protect Sarah Connor from a cyborg sent by the machines to kill the mother of the future leader of the rebellion against the machines. While rejecting the cyborg attacks, Kyle is guiding not only Sarah, but us spectators as well, through the bases that support the film. For example, Cameron intelligently makes him tell a good part of the details of the future in an interrogation to the police, a simple exposition that gives us the necessary knowledge about the gears that move tomorrow. Gradually, we realize that Kyle will have an importance beyond the protection of Sarah's life, as he will play another key role in the war against Skynet. In these few exhibition scenes, it is possible to convey the whole idea of a dark future caused by a nuclear war, and which is dominated by machines, which take humans to extermination camps. The first infiltrated robots had rubber skin and were easy to identify, but then more real skins, blood and everything were made to make them more human, so dogs had to be used to identify them. It still shows the remaining humans living hidden, underground, dirty, hungry (even rats are eating to survive), with John Connor his only hope. We see Reese's past (or would it be the future?) In flashbacks (or flash-forwards, if you look at it chronologically) perfectly stitched into the plot and visually inserted by Cameron with original and smooth transitions, now as a dream, now as a ""bedtime story"".The immersion in Sarah Connor's drama is total since we see her free, light and loose on her scooter, with a smile on her face. We want to know what those two men who appeared just before want with her. Who is the villain? What kind of story is being told? Dropper revelations - but never slow or sluggish - make up for any problems that exist even today with special effects. Only after about forty minutes did we begin to know the story behind the persecutions and first deaths revealed in the script. The pace of the film is also helped by the work of Mark Goldblatt, who oscillates between action and calm, with long cuts that never hinder the understanding of the action. Adam Greenberg's photograph, darkened to mask the problems in the visual effects, but well designed to maintain suspense, has no outbursts of creativity only that works to convey the idea of hopelessness that Cameron needed. Both in violent Los Angeles in 1984 and in the future without much hope for the human race.
The soundtrack by Brad Fiedel (Terminator 2 and True Lies) is heavily dependent on synthesizers to convey inhuman aspects, even strange to the narrative, with the iconic opening song. Although the composition does not vary much (including the love scene between Reese and Sarah has a more romantic version of the theme), it fulfills its role well and transports us that story and emphasizes that climate of robots, future, artificial and futuristic intelligence. They are somewhat metallic / synthesized compositions.The cast is also certainly one of the great assets of the production. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn, in the same way, show a perfect chemistry, as they pass the urgency, fear and anxiety that their roles need. The character of the actress gradually leaves the position of victim, assuming the place that the future holds for her, that of parent and guide of the messiah who will lead humanity against the machines. Schwarzenegger - who was never a good actor - on the other hand, already showed all his charisma on the scene. And, like a murdering cyborg, he definitely found his home, even making his strong Austrian accent function in some way like a robot's voice, perhaps because of the strangeness it causes. The cyborg is losing the apparent humanity represented by the flesh and sage that cover its mechanisms. Thus, Kyle and Sarah expose attack after attack, the antagonist who, as we know, follows different paths in the sequences.However, it is important to emphasize that, despite dealing with a theme that refers to the future and advanced technologies, it is clear that James Cameron's work has not aged well over time, both technologically and in fashion and customs, being an authentic example of a film from the 1980s. Throughout the film, we have numerous peculiarities that become curious these days, which even ends up taking a little out of focus of the plot itself, generating even awe in the audience. We see on the scene phone books being used to locate people's phone addresses, giant walkmans used to listen to the music of the time, mentions of checkbooks, landlines in the middle of the streets and in homes and establishments (we had to buy a card to make connection), pagers, analog televisions, VCRs that allowed recording and watching recordings. I still mention the sound effects of the bullets of the revolvers very typical of western American films and fashion in general. The clothes and hair, especially those of women, leave no doubt that we are located many decades ago.Another factor that does not negate the time of filming is the practical and visual effects. The film was produced after two films of the revolutionary ""Star Wars"" in terms of spectral effects. Not that the effects of the space franchise are excellent (like the beings assembled by Luke Skywalker and Han Solo just before the battle of Hoth in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", launched four years earlier), but what we see is of a lower level. In the scenes in which the Terminator Model 101 makes self-repairs and prepares to continue its mission to eliminate Sarah Connor, the prostheses molded from Schwarzenegger's head, face and arm are clear. We are clearly faced with prosthetics who cannot pass the necessary realism to believe that. What to say then when the Exterminator, already only in its metallic exoskeleton, starts a chase in a shed behind Reese and Sarah Connor? Although the metal model works with the camera still (even if head movement is totally limited), the same cannot be said of when the exoskeleton needs to move. The movements are extremely artificial based on stop motion techniques. It is curious to think that the film, as it was originally conceived, would not work today, except obviously the fictional plot that remains the most interesting and thought-provoking. It would be necessary to completely reinvent the script in search of new solutions for the situations presented throughout the film. Of course, for a world accustomed to the (boring and banal) effects in computer graphics, really what we see in Terminator is outdated. But this is not the way to measure such a film. It must be seen for its quality at the time and for the time it lasted as a cutting edge work, especially if, in this calculation, we take into account the limited budget available. In addition, I challenge someone to review the sequences in which the cyborg T-800 repairs itself in an apartment without shivering and looking away even for a hundredth of a second. It is the magic of cinema.But the dated effects, of course, do not in any way detract from the merits of this James Cameron masterpiece, especially for the concept behind the film. The action scenes are incredible and memorable. How to forget the iconic scenes from Terminator 101 and Kyle Reese arriving transported from the future to the present day? There is also a hunt inside a bar, inside a parking lot, inside the house where Sarah lived with her colleague Ginger (Bess Motta) and even inside a roadside motel room and a police station with dozens of police officers facing in vain the virtually indestructible machine of the future. We also see mind-boggling pursuits through the dark and dangerous streets of Los Angeles with motorbikes, cars and even trucks.The film is a product of its time and was a landmark in science fiction cinema. ""The Terminator"" was acclaimed by the specialized critics at the time of its release and the film is seen by critics and the general public as one of the precursors of the science fiction genre. Given its importance for cinema, it was selected in 2008, by the United States Library of Congress, to be preserved in the National Film Registry, being considered ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"". In addition, the film was responsible for the consolidation of Arnold Schwarzenegger's career and for raising James Cameron, who until then had only directed two films, to another level in Hollywood cinema.",The Terminator
167,agmoldham,The Best terminator,7,10 April 2004,"Whereas the second film had the visuals and budget this film has got the dialogue and suspense. The dialogue is probably aided by Arnie's limited input. I'm sure everyone in the planet must know the story, but just in case, here goes. The future world is ruled by machines, but they face a struggle against a band of humans led by John Connor. They send a terminator (Schwarzenegger) back in time to kill John's mother which will thus stop John from being born. John Connor also sends someone back in time to protect his mother.It's interesting to see how much Sarah ( Hamilton) developed through the films. In this she is still a sweet innocent woman who is just about to have her life turned upside down. Well directed by Cameron this is probably the best of the Terminator films.",The Terminator

Under John Connor, the human resistance turned the tide on the machines and eventually destroyed Skynet's defense grid. In a last ditch effort, Skynet sent a cyborg, called a ""Terminator"", back in time to 1984 to kill Connor's mother Sarah before she would give birth to John.Protector for Sarah against the terminator: John Connor sent back his own operative, a young man named Kyle Reese, to save Sarah. Question is which one will reach Sarah first: The Terminator or Kyle?Schwarzenegger (who plays the cyborg) was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Barbarian, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, ""Oh some sh*t movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.""In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.For the role of Reese, various other suggestions were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the movie was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his ""feelings about the project changed"". Hurd stated that ""almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between (Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese). They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.""On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4,020,663 making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil.After writer Harlan Ellison saw the film, he stated that he ""loved the movie, was just blown away by it"". Ellison believed that the screenplay for the film was based on the episodes ""Soldier"" and ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" which he wrote for the television series The Outer Limits. Orion gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and gave him an acknowledgement credit in later prints of the film. Cameron was against Orion's decision and was told that that if he did not agree with the settlement, they would have Cameron pay for any damages if Orion lost Ellison's suit. Cameron replied that he ""had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth.

176,AhmedSpielberg99,Unpretentious filmmaking at its finest!,8,9 October 2018,"In regards of every single aspect, The Terminator is the textbook example of just how much can be done with as little money.With a simple, yet innovative use of camera movements, and different camera angles, James Cameron shot some of the most impressive action sequences and car chases. The use of zooming technique, in particular, in chases scenes also created a great deal of tension.Simply put, The Terminator is one of the best paced action movies ever. It's not fast as most of the cheesy action flicks of the eighties, nor slow-burning like Blade Runner's that definitely wouldn't suit the movie's tone. It's just perfect!Some may say the special effects are dated and don't hold up very well, but I don't mind them at all. In fact, I liked so much the visual effects, and I found them pretty convincing. The makeup is also remarkable for its time.What dazzles me aren't the effect, though, but the not-a-word-wasted dialogue. There is no line of dialogue that has been wasted. Every line or even gesture is as short as it's powerful as you can ever imagine.The movie isn't without its flaws, though. I found the way we got to know for the first time about the background story pretty lazy. Also, the whole situation was unsuitable for giving us information, but, nonetheless, the time was perfectly enough for us to know the most important things. There were also a couple of times later when the luck played a vital role in saving the protagonist's life. Besides, there is a glaring plot hole at the end of the movie that really drove me crazy till the credits roll.The movie features Arnold Schwarzenegger in his career-defining role, and I can easily see why. Casting him was a perfect choice to portray a relentless, rigid, indestructible cyborg. From seeing her vulnerable to accepting her fate, and trying to convince herself of it, Linda Hamilton is absolutely terrific as Sarah Connor. Michael Biehn is fantastic as well. Kyle Reese is my favorite character from the movie.A great score that just hits the right note by walking a fine line between the bleakness of the post-apocalyptic world and the cheesiness that distinguishes the movie's nature.(8.5/10)",The Terminator
177,Prichards12345,One of a bunch of great 70s and 80s sci-fi movies.,8,18 May 2009,"The film that made Cameron and Arnie into A listers holds up pretty well after 25 years, with exciting action sequences, laconic cops, a legendary one-liner and a powerful depiction of a post-apocalypse world devastated by nuclear war. In 1984, when the film came out, this still felt like something that might be just around the corner.This is the very ideal of high concept - a cyborg from the future comes back to kill the mother of a future resistance leader, thus preventing the humans from defeating a powerful super-computer that's wiped out most of humanity. The premise is actually borrowed from a Harlan Ellison-scripted t.v. episode of The Outer Limits, and Cyborg 2087, a t.v. flick based on a novel by Martin Caidin, which also inspired The Six Million Dollar Man. Whew!It's what Cameron does with it that matters. The movie holds your attention from the get-go and Arnie was never better as the soulless, murderous Terminator of the title. Michael Biehn gives a wonderful performance as a future resistance fighter sent back in time to prevent the killing. ""It's just him and me"" he says at one point. The time machine's been destroyed, stranding him in 1984, and his cause is something he's willing to die for. Yet Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen raise scene-stealing to an art-form as the two cops trying to fathom it all out. Stan Winstone's stop motion effects may have dated but they were state of the art at time the film was made, and Brad Fiedel's memorable pounding main theme will stay with you long after the credits have faded.

Michael Biehn plays an unlikely but well-done hero, with Henriksen, Boen and Winfeld as the unexpected comedic relief that lacked in the sequels. The story suffers from a paradox you could drive a big rig through; the special-effects weren't that far ahead of its time; and the soundtrack may have suited the mood for 1984, but it ended up dating poorly.

183,anselmdaniel,Classic science fiction movie,8,22 June 2019,"This review contains spoilers.'The Terminator' is a science fiction movie that premiered in 1984. The movie is directed by James Cameron and written by James Cameron, and Gale Anne Hurd. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. The movie is about a cyborg assassin sent back in time to kill a mother before she gives birth to a son that will win the war against the machines.The Terminator is a solid science fiction action movie. There are many great action scenes across its 107 minutes of running time. The movie uses the action scenes to great effect by tying it in with the plot. The action is not loud and dumb but makes sense for what the movie is trying to convey. None of the action scenes are too over the top as they make sense for a resistance fighter in Kyle Reese played by Michael Biehn to be trying to stop a futuristic cyborg. The movie has the characters utilize commonly available transportation and weapons to battle the cyborg. Likewise, the terminator played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, utilizes everything it can to track down and terminate Sarah Connor. The cyborg has a logical pattern to track down and kill the mother. The plan made sense and it was interesting to watch scenes from the cyborg's point of view.The performances by the main cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn are excellent. Arnold plays the robotic cyborg incredibly well. There is not much range to be expected but he is able to convey the action scenes well. Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor. She starts as a waitress that must ascend to protecting the future. This arc is a classic one in storytelling and it makes for an interesting shift in the formula by making the entire journey a self-fulfilling prophecy. Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese does an excellent job attempting to protect and save Sarah Connor. As a futuristic resistance fighter, he is portrayed on the screen as a fish out of water when he is in the past.The action in the movie is great in both the visual and audio effects. There are many practical effects that the movie uses and it adds much to the overall movie. I enjoyed that the movie was produced with a rather grounded use of props and vehicles. Nothing felt out of place in this movie. The action set pieces are incredibly solid.The movie does have interesting questions that it asks. The movie utilizes time travel as a plot device. In many cases, time travel can ruin the plot. In this movie, the time travel is a centerpiece of this story. The entire reason why the future happens is because of the time traveling cyborg and resistance fighter. The events in the future simply would not have happened if both of these characters did not time travel. The movie likes to ask this question about the time paradox and does not present an answer. It makes the movie stronger as a result as it appeared the world was in a loop.I highly recommend 'The Terminator.'Grade: A",The Terminator

And now, ten years later,t that feeling hasn't left me. Using his camera in a way only he can do, Cameron instills a sense of dread in every scene, something good old Arnold did quite well.Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also did extraordinarily so, just putting the right amount of emotional touches to their performances. Its an involving film throughout that never fails to hit hard, even in light of some terrible and CGI loaded sequels. And who could forget the score, which only added to the already excellent tension. My favorite scene? No doubt, in a disturbing way, the scene where the T-101 is repairing itself, and the lighting is just so perfect gives off a feeling of absolute fear.

186,Bogmeister,"Relentless and Unstoppable, all you need is Love",10,7 August 2005,"An instant classic, The Terminator succeeds on so many levels, it's still a benchmark with which to test other films, whether they be science fiction, action thriller, horror, romance or even comedy. We begin with the title character himself, uh, itself, essayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. No one can deny this film has a sense of humor when you first see Arnold strolling in the nude toward a trio of punks. Keep in mind, these are the sort of punks you hope you never run across at night, but, in the next moment, you feel nothing but sympathy for them and now Arnold is the source of a kind of horror. It unbalances an audience (seeing this for the first time) but it's done with such confidence, such smooth panache, you're caught helplessly in the undertow of this film's wild yet controlled progression.You're with Arnold, and Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton, and you're overwhelmed by how the story unfolds, presenting concepts of a dark, ugly future while the action gets better & better with each scene. One should realize at this time, over 20 years later, that a good portion of the audience had no idea that Arnold was a robot (ok, cyborg) for the first half hour of the picture when it was first released. To them, unless they read a secret paragraph in a sci-fi magazine, Arnold was just a creepy human killer from the future. This was just another brilliant stroke by writer-director Cameron who, forced into creative decisions by a low budget, transcended all expectations of what a sci-fi B-movie should be. The script never lets us down as far as the Terminator character - it continually proves to be as Biehn describes it - remorseless & unstoppable. The story fools the viewers not once but twice by massacres which happen in places designated 'safe' (the disco and, more so, the police station). By the end, you're as exhausted as Linda Hamilton.When the film veers towards the romance, it's not at all awkward, it's inevitable from the desperate circumstances. Like two souls trapped in a war only they understand, the time-crossed lovers seem thrown together by cosmic forces outside their control. We all seem to sense their time together will be brief, very brief - it's both a very touching and intense moment. In the end, the film proves to be flawless in execution - every scene works and builds on the previous scene. It's astounding how many things could have gone wrong, such as Arnold's rumored initial role as the hero. Hell, this even has Dick Miller selling guns. You can't go wrong there.",The Terminator
187,movieguy1021,The Terminator: 6/10,7,10 October 2002,"Arnold Schwarzenegger won't be known for his winning of Mr. Universe, etc. He's known for his phrase ""I'll be back"", which was made famous from The Terminator.He plays The Terminator, a cyborg who comes from the future to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), an innocent waitress who doesn't believe Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) about that story. Reese also came from the future, but to protect Sarah from The Terminator, for reasons that come into detail later in the story.Schwarzenegger is fun as The Terminator. He only has about 10 lines to say in the entire movie, but I liked him in his futuristic role. Terminator is his most famous movie. It has action coming out the wazoo, but no real thrills. The 108 minute run-time seemed to go by quickly.The special FX, for 1984, were pretty good. Despite what it seemed, the exo-skeleton at the end was not stop-motion as it looked like, it was an animatronic puppet. The explosions looked real, so did all the shootings, and everything else. Biehn was very good as the guy from the future. He seemed to know what he was doing. I wonder why he hasn't been in much lately, though.Hamilton was good, too, as Sarah, but nothing to write home about. Terminator has set an example for others to follow in action movies. Many spoof movies have the ""terminator sight"", and say ""I'll be back"", and all the other catch phrases from the movie. I thought it also had some good places of humor, like all movies should. It is entertaining, also. The dreary look at the future seems almost farcical now, since we now know that there won't be a nuclear war around 1990. So that means it's a little outdated, but it's still fun (if lacking thrills), and recommended.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence and some language.",The Terminator
188,movieguy1021,The Terminator: 7/10,7,30 June 2003,"The Terminator may be the action movie with the most quotable lines, such as `I'll be back,' `Come with me if you want to live,' and `F**k you, a**hole.' Not only that, it's remained one of the most popular action films of the last twenty years, it's continued to delight young and old alike. Added to the mix is icon Arnold Schwarzenegger, and you have yourself one fun romp through both the present and the future.When offered his job in The Terminator, Schwarzenegger was supposed to play good guy Kyle Reese, who became Michael Biehn. Schwarzenegger then played The Terminator, a cyborg from the future that came to the present (aka 1984) to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose son Michael would start in a giant war, etc. You'll figure out the plot as you go along for the ride.The Terminator has something that most action movies now need: action! Instead of PG-13ing it and making it look hokey, James Cameron decided to make it as lifelike as could be, and it really did look lifelike. The effects on Schwarzenegger when he was half-human, half-cyborg looked very real, and would be considered impressive by today's standards. Not being a gigantic gore fan, I did cringe a little, but it was very cool.My rating: 7/10Rated R for violence/gore, some language, and brief nudity.",The Terminator

190,Min111,I like the original more,8,30 March 2018,"The sequel to ""The Terminator"" was very good, so don't get me wrong, but I still think the original movie was slightly better. Both were great movies, yet different in their own ways. ""The Terminator"" looked like it had a more ""darker"" tone to it, and that's something I liked compared to the sequel. That's what it looked. What I liked about ""The Terminator"" was the plot. It was interesting to follow, especially when Sarah Connor first hears about her unborn son. That was my favourite moment, and probably the best moment in the movie. Sarah Connor was surprised to hear the news. Either way, I think this movie is a great set-up for what is to come afterwards. The events take place in the year 1984. It was also the same year the movie came onto screens. It's one of the best action and science-fiction movies to have come out from the eighties. There was also suspense. Let's not forget about another character named Kyle Reese. He's one of the main characters in the movie. He's a soldier from the year 2029. He was sent to the past by John Connor to protect Sarah Connor from a cyborg. A cyborg was also sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor. The only downside is that John Connor was missing in the movie. He's at least talked about in the movie, so that's good to see. That's one of the reasons I like the original movie more. Arnold Schwarzenegger was great in this movie, and it's rare to see that he doesn't play the ""hero"" for a change. In fact, he was actually very ""scary"" as the ""Terminator"". I consider it one of his best movies out there. I'm actually the ""few"" or ""many"" that seen the sequel first. I'm glad though I finally seen ""The Terminator"". It makes the sequel worthy to watch. ""The Terminator"" is an underrated movie. A must see!",The Terminator

194,LebowskiT1000,Sci-fi/Action done right!,10,6 July 2003,"James Cameron deserves a lot of credit or hatching this incredible story and brilliant idea!  This is one of the best told sci-fi/action stories out there.  The action never stops, the story makes complete sense, the acting is great, the special effects are top-notch (given the year that it was made) and the make-up effects / creature designs are phenomenal.All of the actors involved pull off fantastic performances.  Particularly Arnold Schwarzenegger (although he has VERY few lines in the film), Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton, Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen.  Also, keep a watchful eye for Bill Paxton in the beginning of the film, as one of the punks that has a rendezvous with The Terminator.The special effects and make-up effects are outstanding, given that the film was made back in 1984.  By todays standards some of the effects aren't very impressive and at a few times they're actually rather silly looking, but nonetheless well done.  But there are a few times that are just as good as today's special effects and are simply jaw-dropping.The only complaint I have about the film is the music at a few points in the film.  It's not really that bad, it just brands the film as an OBVIOUS 80's film.As I mentioned, the story is just spectacular and told perfectly well.  The story fluidly unfolds from scene to scene and definitely keeps your attention.  If you are one of the few people out there that hasn't seen this film and likes science fiction movies, you should DEFINITELY check this film out, there's something for everyone in this film.  Although, be warned that this NOT a film for children, it definitely has an R rating for a reason. Do yourself a favor and go see this film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading.-LebowskiT1000",The Terminator

It came close with Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and Scarface. Arnold Scwarzzeneger was fabulous in this movie. He's not a very good actor but he surprised me in this film and especially in the 2nd one. The story was great and Michael Biehn was good as the good guy, trying to save Sarah Connor. I haven't seen him in other films because I heared he was a bad actor and his war action type films of his so I guess I didn't want to seen him in them. The special effects were actually good for an 80's film. Didn't bother me at all and didn't complain once. Good film and recommended.8/10",The Terminator

The Dr Who version is some terrorists try to assassinate a man who they think has started a war which lets the Daleks invade Earth dead easy.Another idea stolen from someone else. The film is the classic nightmare of being chased by someone trying to kill you but you don't know why.

197,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: Perfect SF, plenty of action & intelligent",10,7 May 2002,"I'm an action film buff, and since a lot of things have blown up since 1984, you'd think that ""The Terminator"", like ""48 Hrs"", would now be a little dated. No.The Terminator takes an interesting science fiction premise and takes it to intelligent, deep heights. While the film won't exactly change your life (""Contact"", ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Smoke Signals""), it's a fast-paced trip with wonderful realism.The plot is incredibly tight (like ""Memento"" and ""Back to the Future""). Every second counts and each character in the film is always doing something that's in character and meaningful. You can also view the film as a pure action film, but there's a lot of depth here. Notice, for example, that The Terminator is always running -- that's how a machine gets its most efficient movement. The acting is terrific, especially by Linda Hamilton, and the story is sort-of really about her character (the ""everyman"") rises to the challenge.Buoyed even more by its classic sequel, ""The Terminator"" is sure to endure and is the best SF film on the 1980s.Who should see this film:-- SF fans: a must-see, but it's too scary for young kids-- action film fans: a must-see, even if you don't like Arnold-- drama film fans who like to go slumming once in a while.This film is quite intelligent and I suggest you try it.I'll give ""The Terminator"" a 10 out of 10.",The Terminator

199,Rickting,Super strong sci-fi classic,9,17 December 2014,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his most famous role, plays a brutal killing machine sent into the past to kill the mother of the resistance leader who leads the humans in the war against the machines in the future. A human soldier is sent back in time to protect her. Cue loads of sublime science fiction mayhem. The Terminator is inevitably dated due to the small budget, but it's a great time at the movies. It is a science fiction classic and completely deserves to be, thanks to the interesting story and strong action sequences. While it's a fast paced and snappy movie which hurtles along at breakneck speed, there's a moving relationship in the film and the elements of time travel give the story unexpected depth, which ensure the film certainly does not represent its iconic antagonist. Arnold Schwarzenegger dominates the screen in brilliant badass fashion and while he doesn't have many lines, he delivers them excellently and is an intimidating and threatening villain, although he's still not as cool as R2 D2 and C3PO.The brilliantly made action ensures the film crackles with high octane thrills and genuine energy. There are too many chase sequences in the film, but at least they remain fun despite some repetition. It's overall a very well made film and delivers thrill after thrill. The runtime isn't overlong and it's easy to watch and enjoy. Acting is all around good and Sarah Connor, although she really became a cool character in the sequel, isn't your typical damsel in distress. Kyle Reese is also a very good character. In General, The Terminator is an iconic and entertaining movie which has surprising depth and plenty of fun action. It's not the best science fiction film ever and can't help but look slight next to its dream sequel, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, but mostly it's held up pretty well and even though the budget is relatively small the effects and surprisingly convincing. James Cameron's films can leave one cold, but he certainly knows how to turn millions of dollars into ultra cool cinematic art and put butts on seats.9/10",The Terminator
200,dilipbts,The terminator,7,19 June 2020,"It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.In 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg - a terminator - back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease.The director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film.There are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood's most famous lines in it, that of Arnie's 'I'll be back', a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.So, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too 'eightish', and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set",The Terminator

I mean who wouldn't want they're own Terminator around, just for goofs. Send him after the Jehovah's Witnesses, send him after the cops who busted you for speeding last week, send him after the paper boy from Better Off Dead.

To stop Sarah from having a son, a cyborg known as a Terminator is sent back in time to kill her. A soldier known as Kyle Reese is also sent back in time to save Sarah Connor from termination.With the rise of successful science-fiction films in the '70's and '80's, James Cameron introduces another successful sci-fi flick which would live on for decades. The story is well written and is a great concept. The film portrays one main goal of a story but introduces an expansion of what will happen. The casting is well done, with great performances by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. Although Arnold Schwarzenegger is far too famous to watch this film without thinking of other characters he played, he still portrays a wonderful cyborg performance. The effects aren't the greatest in this current age, as many in this film look very unrealistic, but this film is not full of them and rely more on the action.

213,Al_The_Strange,"""It absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!""",9,4 February 2013,"Assassination and murder often makes for a thrilling story as it is, but what if the murderer happens to be a machine from the future? Unstoppable, invincible, unable to feel pain or remorse, unable to deviate from its programming. The terminator is an inherently scary figure, partly because of the traits mentioned above, and also because it comes from a scary future ravaged by nuclear war and a robot apocalypse.The first Terminator film delivers its premise impeccably, and does so with an agreeable amount of action. Granted that all the sequels have surpassed this film in terms of action, The Terminator still delivers plenty of thrills as the titular machines brutally hunts down its targets. Most of the movie is comprised of chases: car chases, foot chases, with intermittent shootouts, explosions, and fights. In spite of this, the film drags very little; it's actually quite tight, as it effectively uses the space in between the action to develop the story and characters.And the story is quite sound, partly because of its unique premise, and largely because it's told really well. It makes phenomenal use of flashbacks to reinforce the background and characters of the story. Its focus on the characters is superb, and you really grow to care for them by the film's end. Overall, the film shows great depth and detail to make it stand above and beyond most other sci-fi flicks.The film looks great, with excellent photography and editing. A lot of scenes, such as the nightclub scene, leaves a great lasting impact. Acting is great: I love Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their respective roles. Writing is pretty decent. This production has plenty of good, utilitarian sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is really weird, but very moody and appropriately industrial.Highly recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",The Terminator
214,JakeBrinkman,A great movie that quickly became very dated,3,26 June 2019,"Note: My first time watching this film was in 2019.Taking off the rose colored glasses, this would be a B-list action flick that would be quickly forgotten if it were released today. It brought a new level of thought into blockbuster action flicks, but there have been successors that use time travel in an action movie much more effectively. Also, the premise was well thought out with few plot holes, but it was always explained in a way that seemed to highlight a lull in the action rather than build tension for the next scene. The acting was very minimal and forgettable, reminiscent of acting in B-list action films today.Saving the most obvious for last, the effects were very dated. The computer generated effects have aged the worst. The clothes and hairstyles are a close second, but they can be forgiven as accurate for the 80s. However, the future costumes can't be forgiven. Everyone literally wearing burlap sacks with faces covered in dirt is both cliched and unrealistic.Finally, the music screamed 80s, not only in style, but also with the disconnect between the score and what's happening on the screen. Movie scores have been one of the slowest film aspects to consistently make progress, and this film is a good example of the inconsistency that remained in the 80s. It's just becoming common to see scores written to evoke emotion for the film's specific scenes, but movies like The Terminator still miss the mark by under- or overplaying the emotion in the scene.All-in-all, it seems like it has all the makings to be an 80s classic, and I can see why it became as popular as it is today. Although I can also see that if it were released today, it would not be nearly as innovative or memorable, and I can certainly see why young Arnold thought this movie wouldn't amount to anything. Perhaps that is why the Terminator reboot series has been performing poorly in the box office.",The Terminator

[*Possible* spoiler follows.] And I love the little love story between Reese and Sarah Connor.

216,PeachHamBeach,"Violent, Gory, Metallic, Raw and Surprisingly Touching and Humanistic",10,20 October 1999,"Although I loved TITANIC as much as anyone,  THE TERMINATOR is my favorite James Cameron movie.  It was raw,  gritty,  violent and although it has its own technological wonders,  they are far fewer than the ones in Cameron's newer movies,  and I liked the lack of frills.  This story about a woman running for her life from a futuristic cyborg programmed to assassinate her is more human than technological.  I hope that Cameron never loses that quality because I've always admired it and noticed it in every one of his films from THE TERMINATOR to ALIENS to THE ABYSS to T2 to TITANIC.  There's lots of special effects,  but he never fails to breathe life into his human characters.  I am like a lot of people,  I really like Michael Biehn and every movie I've ever seen with him in it.  He never gets the kind of attention he deserves,  and this early role of Kyle Reese,  the human soldier who risked ultimately everything to travel over time to help protect Sarah Connor,  was the first nuanced hint of his amazing talent and is still my favorite role of his.  And I'm certainly glad I'm not strange for thinking that the brief love affair that the two had was a touching and fitting though very surprising ingredient to the story.  To me, the talk that they have about the bleakness and pain that Reese knows is in the future and the sudden and unexpected discovery of their love is making a subtle,  yet profound statement,  like saying hope in the stead of hopelessness,  life in the place of lifelessness,  and joy and love in the place of hate and violence and pain. Okay,  I'm corny,  but this movie really did leave me with the corniness you read.  And last but not least,  Arnold Schwarzenegger as the huge,  ammoral killer,  a real treat,  the icing on the cake,  and my favorite lines: ""Twelve guage auto loadah...Phase plasma rifle with a forty watt range...uzi nine millimetah!!!""  : )",The Terminator
217,PeachHamBeach,Review of the Special Edition DVD,10,19 April 2003,"I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the ""terminated"" scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other ""terminated"" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her ""wholesome waitress"" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd ""never"" had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful.",The Terminator
218,markovd111,A classic action movie!,9,7 September 2019,"I remember staying up late as a kid to watch this movie and being pretty satisfied with it. I watched it again some time to go to see if nostalgia googles are blinding me and movie is bad, or it's actually really that good. And, what a surprise, it's a good movie! It's fast, has cool story, action sequences and even cooler antagonist. I don't remember why I gave it 9/10 in the first place and not 10/10. I probably thought it would be too much for an action movie. This still is, after all, just a good action movie without a lot of those ""mindblown"" and ""deep"" moments. But it sure is cool. 9/10 it is, and a recommendation, if you still haven't watched it by this time, which I don't really believe haha :D",The Terminator
219,DavidSim240183,Arnie's finest hour.,10,26 December 2003,"The Terminator was one of the many films I grew up with as a child. It was what started off my fascination with science-fiction. The aspects of time-travel are very interesting, and in the case of this film, it demonstrates what a fundamental impact it can have on the world altering the events of yesterday to affect tomorrow.I imagine just about everyone in the world must have seen the Terminator, since this is the film that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger's film career. This is by far his best film (and performance) when compared to some of his later films.The Terminator begins in the future, 2029 A.D. amongst the ruins of Los Angeles. This is indeed a grim, bleak vision of the future, since there has been a nuclear war, and a war that is currently raging between man and machine. A sophisticated computer, Skynet, has declared war on the human race. Ironically, Skynet was built by humans to act as a defence for humanity. But the computer became self-aware, and decided all people were a threat. So it began the system-wide extermination of the human race.To carry this out, Skynet has built an army of machines to destroy humanity. But a young man, John Connor, formed a resistance movement, and managed to turn the war to our favour. But Skynet is not so easily defeated. It sends a machine called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), back through time to 1984, to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before she can give birth to John.In response, the resistance sends one of their soldiers, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back through time to intercept the Terminator before it carries out its mission. Reese must protect Sarah at all costs, or humanity's future is doomed.Arnie is perfectly cast as the Terminator (or T-101), because he manages to give a very believable performance of a machine. He portrays the Terminator as something that is not clouded by compassion or feeling. Completely emotionless. He will hunt down Sarah to the ends of the Earth if necessary to complete his deadly mission. There is a great scene when Reese is describing to Sarah what it is they're up against:""Listen, and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead.""Arnie is utterly without mercy, tracking down Sarah with total efficiency and clinical detachment. He murders people left, right and centre in his pursuit of Sarah. He allows nothing to stand in his way. Probably the scariest aspect to Arnie's character is he is not evil. He is just doing what he has been programmed to do. If that means committing unspeakable acts to complete his mission, then so be it.The film is extremely suspenseful, as the Terminator cuts a swathe of destruction in pursuit of Sarah. One of the best scenes is when Sarah is in a police station, and the Terminator just barges right in and kills nearly 20 policemen. This is a brilliant example of how single-minded the Terminator is. That scene alone was probably influenced by Assault on Precinct 13, but still the scene is a moment of shocking intensity.Both Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton put in good performances. Sarah's character shows a great deal of evolution in this film. At first, she is a slightly scatty waitress. But when told she is the mother of the future, her experiences harden her until she becomes a brave soldier in the face of adversity. The stunning climax really shows how far she has come from her introduction at the beginning of the film.Michael Biehn's performance is pretty good, because the audience is not really sure what to make of him at first. The script constantly keeps you guessing, and for all we know, Reese might be the bad guy too. He's got a good chemistry with Linda Hamilton, and we get to see his world through his eyes. The scenes of war-torn L.A. are good, and shows the constant struggle humanity must contend with against the machines they created in the first place.Because this was James Cameron's first feature film, it has a rather modest budget when compared to the other two films. Wisely, Cameron uses suspense to keep the audience hooked. Some of the chase scenes are helped no end by the pounding music from composer Brad Fiedel. They feel even more gripping, and send chills down my spine. Admittedly, the FX have dated considerably. E.g. the scene when Arnie must remove one of his human eyes. Other technologies like CGI were only in their infancy at this stage. But still, the endoskeleton looks very impressive, and still scares me at the film's finale.There is a very interesting paradox involving Sarah's son, but for those who haven't seen the film, I won't reveal it. Some of the science seems rather nonsensical, but when talking about time-travel, there are lots of unanswered questions. The paradox is explained further in the other two films, so you may not completely understand the paradox until you've seen all the films in the trilogy.The film that introduced Arnie's catchphrase ""I'll be back"" has never sounded better then in this film. Arnie's movements, mannerisms are all perfect. Everything about this film is superb, and is the best of the Terminator trilogy. From the great beginning and that theme music, to the shocking outcome. It constantly keeps you guessing, and hits you right between the eyes with all of the intensity of an unrelenting nightmare.Simply marvellous.",The Terminator
220,AvidClimber,The birth of many things,9,18 July 2013,"The Terminator is the father of cyberpunk and is one of the very first movie directed by James Cameron where he really started to build his name. He showed his talent with this small budget independent production. The star rating of this film is mainly due to the fact that its a landmark in the industry.The good. Very imaginative background and setting. Well paced scenario. Interesting characters. Captivating story. Solid suspense. Nice action.The actors. The machine is a good role for Arnold Schwarzenegger at the beginning of his career since it doesn't require much pronunciation. I've always loved Michael Biehn and even if he's not at his best, he did great with what he was given. Linda Hamilton hadn't yet bloomed and her limitations are showing a little bit, yet she gave us a great portrayal.The bad. A few overly simple dialogs. The stop motion animation is good, but nowadays, it's an old technology. The mechanical puppet doesn't have human fluidity it should have. The latex stand-in is pitiful by today's standard.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Everyone should see it because it's a landmark, especially sci-fi fans.",The Terminator
221,Rautus,Classic 80's sci-fi action movie,10,1 August 2007,"The Terminator is one of those low budget 80's action movies that is great fun to watch, James Cameron had an interesting idea about the future with machines taking over the world and mankind is fighting them in a war zone. The music has a 80's feel to it which I love, the gun sound effects are also cool and the acting is great, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a great performance as a machine since he shows no emotion, uses guns with great skill, and talks in a way like a machine would. He also says the famous line ""I'll be back."" Micheal Biehn plays Kyle Reese, a solider that has no choice but to fight The Terminator and he does a great job, Linda Hamilton does a great job as Sarah Conner, a women that lives a ordinary life but soon finds herself being hunted down by a unstoppable killing machine and her only help is the solider from the future sent to protect her, she has to become strong and get rid of her fear, in Terminator 2 she shows us that.The film sees a war in the future were humans and machines are fighting each other, a company called SkyNet created the machines but they rebelled against the people who made them and destroyed everything. Some humans survived and decided to take on the machines, one man named John Connor lead the humans against the machines so as a result they sent one of their machines to kill the mother Sarah Connor so that John never exists and they will win, but John sends one of his men Kyle Reese to protect Sarah and stop The Termiantor so that John will be born and Tech Com will battle against the machines.The Terminator is a classic 80's sci-fi movie that should be seen. 10/10",The Terminator
222,willcundallreview,A bit of Sci-fi classic film,7,11 June 2015,"Rating-7/10The Terminator, the name emits a kind of weird thought of Arnold Schwarzenegger or maybe the name John Connor(usually pronounced in an Austrian accent). Whatever Terminator themed thing that comes to mind, this film will no doubt leave you feeling well enjoyed and engaged, in a way that many action films just fail to do. The film is interesting, and again you don't always get that from action movies but the Sci-fi is good enough to combine with the good action to make this exciting and very fun. I found this intriguing in a sense, the story is kind of predictable then also un- predictable at the same time, and that makes it both humorous yet very serious and the suspense is well done too. The ending is the best part about this, this gets better as it goes along and for me the very end is one of the most exciting moments in this entire movie.You know Arnie is the best remembered actor of this film, but not for good reason, sure he is good but don't forget about the others here though. Michael Biehn is firm as Kyle and he makes the serious moments, just that bit more serious. Linda Hamilton isn't always great here, probably the weakest of the main ""good guys"" but she still acts kind of well, just maybe not the best for a leading actor. The cast is picked well there is no doubt here but Arnie to be fair is the real memorable person, he commands his scenes and the lines he is given are at times, gold.Now James Cameron I do feel is overrated here, I know I know how do I think he Is overrated but let me get this out straight, although he is good, as is the film as a whole, I don't think it is a masterpiece. Now Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd create a script that is solid, and it works out well, but I do feel his directing can be a little too, well crash and bang, sometimes scenes get a little too fast and the fighting is too quick to be seen, although all together as said before, he is good.Why do I think this isn't a masterpiece?, well it comes down to this, now it is unique it's way of being made however, I watched this years later, I have been influenced by other films, so maybe to fully love this, you'd have to go back to 84. I do though, feel this is special, in a way in which this plot is still to this day, never been re done to a good quality, and I mean that because Sci-fi films want to emulate this, but they can't or people will know.The fast pacing of this movie makes this easy to like, and it is important because again, not so many action films do this well or make the action fast but well made(but as previously mentioned, not all the action is seamless). The Special effects are a little crazy at times, when the movie starts to go to the future, the space ships are insane and the props are actually kind of funny, of course effects weren't as good in the 80's so a bit of credit to the team behind.All together though I do find this good and although maybe my rating doesn't reflect my full opinion on this, it still tells this is a film nearly everyone likes, even if just a little. It is hard to hate this movie I admit, I mean I didn't try but finding holes in this is fruitless, just sit back and enjoy a bit of movie history.",The Terminator
223,Cinemaniac1984,Where the legend began...,10,3 January 2015,"Who would have thought a low budget science fiction movie aptly named The Terminator would become a successful movie as well as start the meteoric rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a legend in cinema, introduce director James Cameron to Hollywood as a force to be reckoned with, give a new meaning to audiences with the immortal line ""I'll be back"", spawn a large fan base, and then witness the birth of a big-budget saga with an even bigger sequel in 1991 that outdoes the first movie with Terminator 2: Judgement Day and then continue on with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003, Terminator Salvation in 2009, and Terminator Genisys in 2015 as well as a short lived TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.Arnold Schwarzenegger introduces us to his now iconic role as The Terminator, a cyborg disguised as a human being. The Terminator has been sent back in time from 2029 to Los Angeles in 1984 to terminate Sarah Connor in order to prevent the birth of her unborn child, John Connor, who would go on to lead the human resistance to victory against Skynet and the machines in the future following a nuclear war which almost wiped out most of the human race. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in a rare role as a villain, is perfect as the Terminator, a killing machine who is programmed to kill without any pity, remorse or fear in his single minded quest to terminate Sarah Connor.Linda Hamilton in an early role introduces us to Sarah Connor, a timid and mousy waitress who's life will be changed forever upon the discovery her unborn son, John Connor, will become the future leader of the human resistance. She still does not believe that such an event will happen with the nuclear war and the rise of the machines, until her encounter with the Terminator and thus begins her quest to stay alive for the sake of her unborn son and to survive this real life nightmare.Michael Biehn in one of his early roles plays Kyle Reese, a young, battle-hardened, and world-weary soldier who volunteered to be sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 by John Connor to protect his mother at all costs from the Terminator. Once Reese rescues Sarah, he warns her about the impending doom of the human race from the nuclear war and her future significance carried by her and her unborn son.Keep an eye out for Bill Paxton in an early role as a street punk.Though The Terminator is now 30 years old, it still stands the test of time as a positive influence on all science fiction and action movies since. Exciting, high energy action sequences which turns downtown Los Angeles into an urban battleground and leads to an even bigger chase to a climatic showdown keeps the dynamic tension in The Terminator very tight and does not let the audience go for one moment.Taut and kinetic direction with a sharp eye for attention to detail from James Cameron keeps The Terminator as a gritty, clever, breathtaking, exciting and thrilling movie from beginning to end.Definitely one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.10/10.",The Terminator

The special effects are pretty dated (see the stop motion robot; fake horizon at the end) but that doesn't mean the climactic fight isn't great or the open-ended epilogue isn't supremely satisfying (""...there's a storm coming in"" ""I know"").

227,emperor_bender,"""Hey, I think this guy's a couple cans short of a six-pack""",10,9 April 2008,"Good action movies like this are rare. They just don't make them like they used to. But this is one for the ages. You can not create another storyline like this one and get even 1/10 the results.The Terminator is a classic and most likely will be even after the ""future"" portrayed in the film. James Cameron has done a great job of creating one of the best movies of all times.First off, there's a perfect cast. Every part seems to have been specially designed for the actor. The Terminator could not have been played by anyone other than Arnold. If the Terminator is played by anyone BESIDES Arnold, then it is not being played correctly. Arnold plays him so coldly but very cool as well (if THAT makes any sense). Michael Biehn plays the fearless, mentally unstable hero, Kyle Reese better than anyone else could have. Linda Hamilton shows her famous ""heroine"" performance here as the young, not-yet-tough Sarah Connor.Combine great performances with a perfect story and you have one of the best movies ever made. This movie can seem like a slasher at times, but it is far above any slasher.This is one movie that everyone should see at least once. 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie, you either don't have the money to see it or you just don't like good movies. (Comment rating going to hell for that one)",The Terminator
228,ronbell-23984,Classic,10,9 April 2020,Great movie. The story was original and the movie executed to perfection. The main launch pad for Arnie this was. This movie puts Sci Fi movies made now in the shade if you can look past the special effects from the 80's.,The Terminator
229,charchuk,Terrific action and smart sci-fi,9,15 April 2007,"One of the best science fiction films of all time. A perfect blend of action thrills and sci-fi intrigue, with a fair dose of horror elements throw in. The story borrows from a ton of sources, but still manages to be mostly original, and actually all makes sense in the end. Time travel stuff can get pretty dodgy sometimes, but this manages to all work out with a predestination paradox explaining everything. The sequels kind of ruin this part of the story, but this film executes it perfectly. It's also got some great acting, from Arnold's iconic role to Michael Biehn's under-appreciated performance to Linda Hamilton's surprisingly good turn, and some terrific effects, considering how low-budget it was. The action sequences are perfectly staged, and the exciting climax is both terrifying and exhilarating. Though I like T2 better, I can appreciate how influential this film was.",The Terminator
230,EthanBJones_03,One of the most original sci-fi action movies ever made.,8,12 July 2017,"'THE TERMINATOR' was directed by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwartzeneger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. ​In the not too distant future, the machine have taken over out world and set out to exterminate the human race. The machines send back The Terminator(Arnold Schwartzenger), a cyborg killing machine with one objective: Eliminate Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). Rebellion leader, John Connor, sends back Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah and defeat The Terminator once and for all!This movie is awesome. Do I think it's the greatest action or science-fiction movie of all time? God no. It's fantastic for what it is but I don't believe that it is a masterpiece. Needless to say, the acting and action is superb. I mean it is pretty close to perfect in some areas. Cameron's world building is incredible and he is a master at drawing the audience into his world. This movie is fantastic and I highly recommend you see it.The story is great and very well written. Cameron is seriously a genius at world building and is very in depth at describing this world. That is also one of the movie's downfalls. This in depth world building required a lot of exposition and that doesn't work towards the movie's favour. Obviously a lot of exposition was needed for a new IP of this scale but everything can be toned down a bit and condensed and that is what I wish happened here. The climax is fantastic and possibly one of the best ever put to film. I wont spoil it for anyone who hasn't watched it but I can assure you it is awesome. I wasn't too impressed by the ending because I predicted it but if you were, I wont take that away from you. It's a good ending I just saw it coming.Schwarzenegger is cold, calculating and ruthless. I love it. The Terminator is one of the greatest antagonists in movie history and nothing can take that title away from him. The fact that he is relentless is terrifying and Schwarzenegger really sells that side of the character. Truly a masterclass of character creation.Linda Hamilton was great as Sarah Connor and I really bought her arc from the beginning of the movie to the end. She starts as a bumbling waitress with a lot to live up to but slowly evolves into that legend and that is mostly down to Hamilton's awesome performance. She was the 80s Ripley. That is probably the best way of putting it.Michael Biehn was surprisingly great as Kyle Reese. The point of his character was primarily to deliver exposition to the audience which isn't exactly great character work but aside from that he's an interesting human being that has a fascinating background that isn't really explained but is clear through Biehn's brilliant performance.Technically speaking, this is a very well done movie. Aside from one messy semi-action sequence in the middle, I was very pleased with how the movie was shot and edited. The lighting is fantastic. Costume design is great. Set design is fantastic. The visual effects in this movie are mind-blowing and all effects used on The Terminator should be retroactively awarded an Oscar.It is also one of the most quotable movies in history. 'Come with me if you want to live' and 'I'll be back' are arguably two of the greatest lines of dialogue ever uttered on screen. The quote 'Listen, and understand. That terminator is out there, it cant be bargained with, it cant be reasoned with, it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear, and it absolutely will not stop...EVER, until you are dead!' is one of my favourite lines of dialogue in film history and is truly the definition of perfection. It gives me chills whenever I hear it and is a work of art as far as writing goes.Brad Fiedel's score for this movie is awesome and I absolutely treasure the score that signals impending doom from The Terminator. It is fantastic and I cannot praise that score any more. It is brilliant and I absolutely adore it.The action is awesome in this movie. The car chase scene, the police station sequence, the masterpiece that is the climax; these are all truly great scenes that elevate this movie above the rest. They lack the fun aspect that most other action movie's possess but that doesn't make it any less awesome.I cannot recommend this movie enough. Comparing the tone of this review and the rating may imply that my rating was too harsh but the flaws I mentioned earlier on are my only genuine flaws with this movie. I cannot flaw this movie any more and it is truly excellent. I highly recommend you see this movie. I'll rate it 8 'I'LL BE BACKS' out of 10.",The Terminator

232,rooee,Terminator: Genesis,8,24 June 2015,"Every bit as relentless and single-minded as the latest Mad Max instalment – and possessing a similar number of car chases – The Terminator was the 1984 calling card of both James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sure, the latter had a couple of lousy Conan films under his belt, but here was a role that would make him a star and give cinema an antihero every bit as iconic as Hannibal or Joker.The story is fantastically simple. In the future, machines take over, exterminating humanity from the post-nuclear wasteland. The human resistance is led by a man named John Connor. The machines send a ""Terminator"" unit (Arnie himself) back through time to kill John's mother, Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Meanwhile, the humans send a protector, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). The chase begins.Imagine knowing nothing about this world. Imagine the shock of seeing Arnie laid low with a shotgun, only to rise time and time again. For the first third of the movie, beyond a title card, precious little is explained. All we're seeing is a woman stalked by two moody men. The idea for The Terminator was apparently born of a fever-dream, and with its flashback-forward structure and descending darkness it is drenched in sweaty helplessness.It's also a masterclass in efficiency and visual storytelling. When it comes to filling in the backstory (here, a future-story), Cameron expertly brings convincing emotional weight to his exposition scenes. Reese is the emotive counterpoint to the dead-cold 101: his mission is driven by love. Not some cheesy, possessive love; Reece carries with him the hope of humanity. He loves John Connor (whom, intriguingly, we never see), so how can he not hold a near-biblical reverence for the mythic mother? Before Judgment Day gave us the powerful and handsome activist, the 1984 origin shows us the gentle, pretty Sarah. (Emilia Clarke has her eyes.) Yet her ascent to soldier is entirely believable given the unbelievable events swirling around her. Sarah is no damsel in distress; she's a warrior waiting for the right distress to unleash her potential.The poodle-perms and mecha-synth music will either be seen as dating the film, or delivering pleasing period delights, depending on your viewpoint. But what will never date is the film's brutal purity. As we gaze at the poster for Genisys, with Arnie and Sarah pressed together in unity, let's not forget how scary and thrilling it was to see her terrorised... and then turn around and terminate his metal ass.",The Terminator

A human soldier is sent back as well, to protect her. Together, they flee the cyborg, who will stop at literally nothing to destroy the hope of the future. This is a very fun action film that most action fans will most definitely enjoy.The Terminator is embedded into everyone's memory as one of the most recognizable action films ever, as it should be, considering it shot both director James Cameron and star Arnold Schwarzenegger into super stardom. This is also a highly referenced, parodied, and quoted film. It isn't as epic of its superior sequel, but it still manages to pack a wallop. It was made on a relatively low budget, but it still manages to look awesome. I liked how James Cameron successfully mixed together action, science fiction, and suspense to make an exciting movie.The acting in the movie is very good. Arnold Schwarzenegger is obviously perfect in the role, considering it's his best known. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are very well together.

234,kdnor2011,Awesome movie,9,1 September 2011,"Hard to believe that James Cameron started out with something as small budgeted as The Terminator, and now he has directed the two highest grossing films of all time. Today a lot of people hate James Cameron because he has mediocre stories mixed in with amazing special effects, where as 30 years ago he brought us a very well done story about how technology may overthrow the human race one day.Now a few things I didn't like in this movie, it is a little bit slow, if you are very impatient you may not like this movie, but if you can get pass the slower parts you will find a really fun flick. I don't see why they couldn't just wrap laser guns in a piece of meat, I didn't see much purpose in following the police chief, he doesn't have much impact on the story, and it can be very depressing at times, and would have been nice to have a little more comic relief.I love stories that try to warn us about how we can mess up the future, either by government or technology. This film applies more today than it did back in 1984 now that we have Internet, cell phones, iPods and all that. The special effects are excellent, and this movie had a very low budget. The action scenes are good, but nothing groundbreaking, they get the story moving, but they're nothing special. And the characters are all interesting, weather you like James Cameron or not, you can't deny he knows how to make a strong female lead, and Sarah Conner is one of them. She starts out as a waitress who can't even do her job right, then becomes a bada** near the end.The Terminator is one of the best examples of how to make a film on a low budget. Both the story, and the special effects are great, the characters are interesting, and it's just a fun movie to watch.

James Cameron is a genius - was and still is one of the best filmmakers of our time. While some of the effects dated a bit (the terminator face surgery always seemed fake to me, even when watching it as a kid, but I still liked it then and like it now) and are more obvious when watching the movie in HD instead of a VHS (most notably the rear projection effects), this movie remains an achievement for its time and budget and still holds to this day the same effect it had 30 years ago.Fantastic combination of vision, effects, writing, direction, cinematography, score and production. Good acting by the entire cast.I'm curious as for why Cameron chose to reveal the ""terminator view"" when he did and didn't save it up for a bit later. It's hard for me to judge, having watched this movie so many times, but wouldn't it have been better not to show it at that scene and let the audience wonder whether Kyle is really telling the truth or just making up stuff?",The Terminator
236,Mike_Devine,An action/sci-fi story that defined a genre,7,28 June 2021,"Some actors are defined by their most iconic roles, for better or worse. In the case of Arnold Schwarzenegger, it can be argued that his portrayal of the Terminator was the pinnacle of his career, and 1984's film by the same name marked the genesis of everyone's favorite cyborg assassin.James Cameron's 'Terminator' was a completely new, groundbreaking story told in cinema. While the special effects are somewhat laughable nowadays, they really were impressive back in 1984. The story itself was pretty pedantic, but that wasn't the main draw to begin with. Instead, it's the mix of suspense, action and Schwarzenegger's delivery of one liners like ""I'll be back"" that steal the show.But it's not just the Arnold show. Linda Hamilton gave her breakout role and is able to transform the mostly average Sarah Carter into a tough chick who must fight for her life...literally. The performance given by Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sort of overlooked, but should have more reverence attached to it given the amount of screentime he had and the importance of his character.'The Terminator' is not the best entry in this franchise, but it certainly marked a strong foundation to build on.",The Terminator

In 1997 a nuclear war broke out, killing most. Those remaining formed a resistance against these super computers/terminators. It's a dark future were humans have to be careful, one mistake could be their last. The resistance mostly do their movement at night. They still have to be careful because terminators blend in and the also use infrared to see. Most keep dogs, because they have the ability to warn if a terminator is close or has infiltrated their camp. These supercomputers have the ability to alter the future by sending a terminator back in time to target someone who might be a threat in the future. A Terminator has one mission search and destroy. The resistance also has a plan to protect the target, one volunteers to go, Kyle Reese( Micheal Biehn) he is aware no one comes back from this dangerous mission.We go to present day Los Angeles, 1984. It is a warm night and two electrical disturbances come out thin air. They are in 2 different places, one is the human resistance member, Kyle Reese. The other is the T- 100, the terminator sent to find Sarah Connor ( Linda Hamilton). Reese will do everything he can to protect Sarah from the terminator, but first he needs to find him. Sarah is nervous, because to other women with that name were killed earlier in the day, and according to the phone book she is the next in line. When Sarah's date cancels she notices Reese following her. She enters a dance club and phones the cops, they tell her to say there, because it is a public area. When she notices Reese enter she gets scared and ducts under the table. When the T-100 arrives and notices her, he pulls a gun. It's not until the last minute Reese spots him, and rescues Sarah. He tells her who he is, and what is after her. A Terminator that looks human, but has her marked for termination. She thinks he's crazy, until he explains more about his past; and why he's here. They develop a friendship and wants to know more. He tells her in the near future she will become the mother of a top resistance leader, John Connor. At first she 's upset, she doesn't want this so called honor. As each day goes by, their relationship grows, she knows Reese will keep her safe. One day they get caught by the cops and both are taken in. The cops, plus a psychologist think Reese is crazy; and Sarah wonders too. Later that night the T-100 finds them at the police station. There is a massive gunfight, but Reese and Sarah are able to escape. The two escape, but need to lay low for awhile. They find a motel buy bomb making supplies for pipe bombs & have a very intimate night. Eventually, with the materials they made Sarah is able to destroy the terminator by crushing it in a steel press, but Reese perishes. Near the end, Sarah is preparing for the storm that is headed. She is in a Jeep, has a dog by her side, and John Connor will soon be born. This is one of my favorites, it has a lot of action, the plot is excellent, and the cast ROX. This film will make you wonder, will machines eventually take over our future?",The Terminator
239,h-28658,If you haven't seen this movie I'd highly recommend it.,8,11 June 2020,"I'm late to the party with this one. It took me a while to see this movie but I really enjoyed this movie. It was action packed, it was entertaining, it was crazy seeing Arnold be the bad guy. I was never bored watching it and I'm glad I saw this movie. It is just as good as everyone says it is.",The Terminator
240,mOVIemAN56,Everything that defines a sci-fi/action film,8,4 May 2007,"""I'll be back."" Uttered by the Terminator just before he launches into a murderous rampage as he looks for Sarah Connor, a woman who will give birth to the savior of humanity in the future. The Terminator is not simply an action film. The Terminator is not simply a sci-fi film. It is both rolled into one. However the Terminator breaks away from the norm of all flash and no show.Sarah Connor is a regular woman living in Los Angeles. She's normal until someone attempts to assassinate her and then protected by a man claiming to be the future. The story is pretty much this stranger attempting to protect Sarah from this assassin who says very little. However the assassin is not human, he is a cyborg and the man claiming to be from the future actually is from the future sent back in time to protect the mother of the future savior of humanity against the machines who will attempt to destroy it.When I first read the plot for this I was so confused I was uncertain I wanted to watch it. Finally I did and I loved it and go back to it for a good story. The film could have been terrible. Everything could have gone wrong but Cameron was the driving force behind the film. He makes everything work how it should from the action to the plot to the acting. Everything flows as it should. It showed how much skill Cameron had even in his younger days of directing. (Remember this is 13 years before Titanic would come out)The acting is nothing great. Yes Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton give convincing performances. Michael Biehn in my opinion was one of your top actors in the 80's and he pretty much disappeared. In The Terminator he is cool, bright, sexy, and all else convincing as a soldier turned bodyguard. Linda Hamilton shows how true actresses should act. She convinced me she had no idea what was going on when she first had that gun pointed in her face. Both leads give strong and worthwhile performances.Of course the most famous of the film is Arnold. Cold, cunning, and silent he portrays the Terminator. I really must comment that Arnold barely does any acting whatsoever except for walking, shooting, and a rare word or two. However, it doesn't mean he is a waste on the screen. Arnold, when he found out how little acting he was going to have to do made sure he was using the weapons correctly and acting as much a machine as he possibly could. The story is actually very strong. Instead of no evidence being given of the future a ton of information is given including flashbacks (or would it be flash forwards) of battles Reese has gone through in his life. Nothing is set directly, many things have to be figured out on your own but nothing is really difficult to understand. The plot line is complex and an amazing world is painted around the storyThe action scenes are some of my personal favorites, especially the showdown in the police station. Cameron got exactly what he wanted when he directed the film. He wanted darkness, rage, violence, a story line that worked. However, the film isn't all about action and violence, it is about humanity and how it is destroying itself. He wanted to show what the future could hold for humans with the possession of nuclear weapons and advancements in technology. He got exactly that. Cameron wanted to make as dark a film as he possibly could with top action sequences of the time and a sci-fi world only outdone by Star Wars in a film. 4/5 stars",The Terminator
241,akshatmahajan,The Best!!!,10,22 May 2021,"I watched this movie when I was young and became fan of Arnold. Today, I re-watched the movie and again enjoyed it alot.It is great action movie. Some people complain of boredom in the film. Yes, I agree there are some small scenes of boredom but it did not significantly affect my experience with the film. Arnold perfectly played the role of terminator. I cannot imagine another actor representing the character. Sarah and Kyle's relationship was also interesting but could have been made much better. The plot, soundtrack, acting... everything in the movie was great.Overall, I would recommend this movie to everyone... literally everyone.",The Terminator
242,tankace,Post Apocalypse from robot 101.,8,18 July 2016,"We, humans, have imagined for centuries who the world would be in the future. This is one of the most usual setting for science fiction and the most common of that variety is the post-apocalyptic future, in which all things more or less goes to hell and humans have to survive in the wreckage of our fallen civilization. Now there have been many interpretations of that kid over the years in books, television series, comic books and most prominently in films. Now Terminator isn't the first science fiction film in a post apocalyptic world, far from it there have been dozens of them with some of the most well known up to its opening in 1984 be Logan's Run, Silent Running, Soylent Green, Blade Runner and Time Machine (1960). So what made to stand out of the crown?First it is the story ,which goes like this, in the future machines have rise up and we are in a war against them for survivor and dominance of the planet. During it Machines send back in time a robot, made to look like a human, a Terminator in order to kill Sarah Connor the mother of the leader of the resistance Jon, before she gives birth to him. For that the Resistance send also a human back to the same date in order to prevent the robot from its goal!The story was one of the most original at the time for it made a revolutionary change to the Post Apocalypse: use time travel as a weapon, back in 1984 this idea was ground breaking for none have though up to that point ""Why not kill the future at its root?. One other thing that was added was hardcore action in the mix and the result was so successful that after this flick many movies and comic books were written using this style, with 12 Monkeys and X-men Days of Future Past been just two examples.In short the movie rocks, the action rocks , the effects are awesome ,apart from one scene and I think that was the first movie to make the Predestination Paradox famous. Also the fact that from 1984 and beyond robot killing machine look much more threatening doesn't hurt either for before 1984 all robot looked like radios on legs!If you haven't seen it ,do it and if you believe that Terminator Genisys was a shame to the Terminator Logo ,we are on the same side!!",The Terminator
243,dvc5159,Relevant more than ever,9,19 July 2014,"30 years down the road, James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" remains an enthralling science fiction thriller, perhaps now more relevant than ever. By now nearly everyone would have heard about how Cameron miraculously made such an excellent film on a miniscule US$6 million budget or so, or perhaps how the eponymous character turned bodybuilder- cum-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger into literally Hollywood's next big thing. It is a testament to Cameron's genius into crafting his unique vision despite and because of his budget limitations, and perfectly casting his stars to suit said vision.We all know the drill by now, so let's talk quality. Linda Hamilton portrays Sarah so well as a normal young woman, confused by this sudden chain of events, that she has logically no choice but to buy into Reese's story. Michael Biehn fits Reese to a T with a gruff yet youthful look, a perfect look for a determined soldier fighting a war he wants to end badly, despite his limitations. Though it's under a relatively short amount of time, Cameron takes his time for the audience to really get to understand both Sarah and Reese's predicaments – to have characters to root and care for, to see them find a way out despite the odds. And a romantic twist is added by Cameron that surprisingly doesn't feel forced, yet somehow perfectly (and ironically) completes the time travel loop that secures John's existence. We're dealing with a romance that transcends both time and space, and Cameron handles it so well, he would revisit these romantic traits with greater detail in his future megalith ""Titanic"".What makes the film work more than it should is Cameron's genius in casting Schwarzenegger as The Terminator. A former Mr. Olympian, Schwarzenegger is renowned for his sculpted body – straight out of a Greek stone garden – more than his acting prowess. No matter, his manner of speaking less, and frighteningly intimidating stare clearly unnerve the hell out of audiences, and they still do today. Say what you will about Schwarzenegger's career as an action icon/live-action meme, the man still has a stare that can kill. His strong, iconic Austrian accent works wonders with the machine-like delivery that Cameron was intending. With Schwarzenegger's casting, the stakes are higher for both Sarah and Reese to escape this monstrosity.Because time-travel is involved and explained in an easily digestible way (physics be damned), and because Cameron directs with such efficiency and confidence it might as well be made today, the film has aged exceptionally well despite some cornball stop-motion effects that show off its low budget – all due praise to the late Stan Winston though for his remarkable, if not grotesque, make-up effects and design that add to the sheer horror aspect of the film. It is a testament to Cameron's genius that he has managed to combine great talent both in front of and behind the camera, into creating one of the seminal and memorable films of the '80s decade, and one that will spawn a successful sci-fi franchise with a dedicated fanbase. Make no mistake that the basic framework of ""The Terminator"" essentially represents a B-movie at its surface (Cameron did tutor under B-legend Roger Corman, after all), but Cameron pulls off more tricks up his sleeve. There is a lean, mean atmosphere that permeates each scene throughout, making 1984 Los Angeles seem like a lurid fever nightmare, but that's secondary compared to the hellish, poverty-stricken future he has envisioned for us humans. Brad Fiedel's metallic, iconic score seeps through every alley and night- painted street with a sense of dread and gloom, the synthesized, electronic score complementing Adam Greenberg's cyan-tinted, industrial cinematography to make it feel all the more nightmarish.Most people back than would have balked or be amazed at a wireless internet connection for everyday use, as if we are surrendering our will to technology for it to take over our lives. And I'm seeing it being endorsed in many a commercial or article. Is the development of technology a bad thing? Not at all. But a good servant can be a bad master, especially if left out of control. Cameron had a fear of that, saw the vision, and ran with it all the way. If we were to leave our household chores to artificial intelligence, or the military leaving unmanned drones to scour the battlefield, what's there to say that eventually artificial intelligence would be used to secure nuclear weapons? Or that they might even become sentient - Cleverbot and Siri may be precursors to Skynet, and Japanese technology is developing robotic humanoids that can deduce for themselves in the near future. The war shown in the film may take place in 2029, but Judgment Day can still happen. Better never than late, I say.""The Terminator"" may be surpassed by its immediate successor in terms of scale and action sequences, but this is a leaner, meaner film, and its initial allegory remains superior and more clear-cut; in the realms of science fiction it remains unmatched, as a bleak reminder of the future and technology gone wrong, perfectly represented by its unstoppable, merciless eponymous monster of a character, but also that of humanity's undying spirit to create their own fates. Cameron might have come a long way since then, having helmed two of the most expensive and highest- grossing films in history back-to-back with some truly groundbreaking visual effects technology implemented in both, but this only highlights his original, cautionary vision for the future, one that we are all far too willing to embrace wholeheartedly.",The Terminator
244,Med-Jasta,Funny to watch now...,10,9 June 2020,"Knowing what we know now about Terminator. It's funny to think of this as a stand alone movie. I saw this for the first time after seeing T2 about a million times so I already knew what was going on. I don't know how the previews are but you don't know that Arnold is a robot till you see his robot POV half way through. And Kyle explains what happens after the movie with her training John which was cool to see. Of course James Cameron had it all figured out. Why did I think he would do any less?The writing is so good. The way the backstory unfolds and little excuses that need to happen in order for a story to work are thought out. All movies need to do them in order to create situations but sometimes they don't have believable reasons for them to happen, you won't find that here.The characters aren't on the screen a lot but their characterizations come up very effortlessly to create the world.Just the story of ""the phone book killer"" is really cool on its own. And how creepy would that would be if someone with you name in your city was murdered? And then that she jumps into action after the second one is killed. Because that would raise a flag. I like that Sarah is just a completely average person. She isn't messed up or anything it's just normal as hell. We don't even really get into her which is nice. And it's funny to go back because we know her as this warrior so to see her as average is funny. Of course Linda Hamilton can play both because she's fantastic.The things that Cameron does in T2 from this are cool and subtle. Little shots here and there. It's strange to see a movie of his that doesn't have a gigantic budget.One thing that I can't really make sense out of, which doesn't matter because there wouldn't be a movie without it. Is how is Kyle his dad? How does John exist if this sending back to the past thing never happened? I don't know. The reason I'm not a fan of time travel stuff. It' hurts my head rationalizing it so I'll just accept it.And robots that are really smart make sense but how the hell did they invent time travel? No one seems to question that. That's a way different kind of leap on technology. Haha. I'm not knocking the movie, it's just funny.",The Terminator
245,TheHoodOfSwords,Classic Action Film,8,16 May 2020,"So I kind of did a double feature that worked incredibly well. War games and then this movie. Both are really about humanity and machine. I've heard the sequel is better then the first on this franchise, but I went into this with admittedly pretty high expectations. The movie delivers on the Sci-Fi thriller and crime story pretty well. The casting of Arnold is amazing and for the most part the special effects don't hamper it. Parts of it are supposed to be a bit tongue and cheek and I think it's done pretty well. The romance gets a bit strange but it isn't front and centre so much that you notice it too much. I found all the action and chase scenes to be pretty damn cool. I do think the world could have been built up a bit more. Since the story is all about the world being so bad they have to send a Terminator back to that humans never take over. We get a bit of development of it later on but it's not a whole amount. Still, super solid great action Sci-Fi movie with some great lines and even a bit of comedy.",The Terminator

But what a movie! This gives us the origins of Sarah Connor and her struggle against the machines. This has to be one of my favorite Arnie films; this and T2. It's also one of my favorite James Cameron sci-fi films, along with Aliens and Avatar. Though Arnie is portrayed as a villain in this one, he literally steals the show. And the special effects by Stan Winston are good too. I'll keep this one and the second one as my favorite Arnie Terminator films and avoid the others.",The Terminator

However, I can't deny that it aged pretty badly. It's still quite entertaining as it's fast-paced, straight to the point and with a good atmosphere, but everything has been made better in other films. The Terminator character has been built around Arnold Schwarzenegger's stiffness and inexpressiveness, and it works great for this film.

248,GeorgeRoots,I'm Surprised That My Appreciation For The Movie Seems To Deepen Every Year.,10,15 October 2014,"It's so crazy to think that James Cameron ""peaked"" back in 1984 with ""The Terminator"". Of course the man has gone on to constantly top his achievements with stunning special effects, and the two highest grossing pictures of all time. But can you actually believe that Cameron had sold the rights for one dollar, and it has gone on to become one of the most popular movie franchises ever made?! A cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from weapons program SKYNET, is sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of mankind's future saviour. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier from the future is also sent back in time to save her. ""The Terminator"" in a nutshell, is spectacular. From the ""Tech-Noir"" style, the casting and immortal theme composed by Brad Fiedel. I can't begin to say how much this left an impression on me at 10 years old, albeit my parents sat me through the sequel first in order to see if I could handle this one. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn have a wonderful kind of chemistry, that doesn't fall into familiar mediocrity or the most absurd levels of an unexpected romance. But of course the whole movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger's playground, and boy does it look like fun to be in his shoes. What's left to say is that Cameron's shots remain ever present in my head, and Stan Winston's practical effects are still capable of making my friends stomach churn.Final Verdict: An icon of Science-fiction is born, and one of the best movies you can't wait to be old enough to watch (Luckily I managed to skip a couple years). 10/10.",The Terminator

251,Silverzero,"Visceral, violent sci-fi thriller which defines the 1980's.",10,5 October 2002,"For me, the thing that stood most from this film was the foggy atmosphere and far out-dated, cheesy music. Yes, I did like this, very much so but it does have its flaws.The films visual effects were outstanding for their time but the quality is poor, compared to todays standards. Thank God there's not much of it. But despite this poor CGI the films atmosphere and visuals are excellent. The movies typically foggy, 80's visuals go surprisingly well and add to the films overall effect. The neon lights and glamour also contribute.Unfortunately not much can be said for the acting. Arnold Scharzanegger does have good acting abilities (as proved in End of Days). But with only 16 lines he does come a little ""short"". Michael Biehn isn't much better and doesn't come across well trying to be an action hero,(what sort of name is Kyle Reese). Linda Hamilton is good, nuff' said.The Terminator will always be remembered as a classic. In my opinion its better than then the sequel.

253,shanfloyd,Seeing the film in today's point of view...,8,2 August 2003,"Commenting on this film after watching Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was not easy. I've seen it for seven or eight times before this. So when I sat before my TV to watch it again, just a day after I saw T3 in theatre, it gave me a new idea. That the Terminator (1984) never meant to be a sci-fi eye candy based on raw action, which T2 and more precisely T3 have become. It should be classified into some sci-fi horror to be more perfect. That creepy Terminator model, that gory look of Schwarzenegger, the night based story and especially that background music--- all meant to create a feeling of horror or dark thriller, never a die-hard action flick. I don't know if seeing this film in the perspective of that era, early 80's, could tell a different thing. But to be an action movie in today's eyes, Terminator is not sufficient.Years before The Matrix presented us the very idea that in near future machines or self-aware computer programs will enslave the human race, there came this thing... SkyNet. Perhaps to deal with this concept was not Cameron's primary goal in this rather low budget superhit. His intention was to make another cult film. Success was much higher than expected, it's true. But that is not my point. I just mean if Terminator was made in late 90's, not back in '84, it would have been a much more different movie. Inevitably the major focus had to be on the basic concept, not Arnold building his muscles in the rooftop. I realise in sudden horror that it might not cast Arnold as well... since a killing machine doesn't have to be a Mr. Universe in figure. And in today's eyes, it would surely be an absurd idea too to an indie filmmaker.Whether Terminator would succeed if made now as much as it did back then is a different story. All that is important is its effect on filmmakers thereafter. It was a flawed film, true. But it created a genre of its own. It was highly extraordinary, even in the eyes of present-day post-Matrix viewers. That skin-on-one-side look of Arnie's face became a trademark; his ""I'll be back"" became a legend. This film generated several inspired works but few equals. I know exactly why T2 is a different movie at all. Terminator is a classic of its own kind.",The Terminator
254,EvanKevelson,ONE OF THE MOST OVER RATED MOVIES OF ALL TIME,3,19 September 2020,"Preface I rate films on 3 factors was it entertaining, was it impactful on my mind, or both
1. There are numerous earlier films with better special effects e.g. Alien, Star Wars & Empire Strikes Back.
2. The story line is ridiculous. TIME TRAVEL EVEN IF POSSIBLE WOULD MEAN TIME IS CIRCULAR WITH NO BEGINNING OR END, OR THE TRAVELER TO THE PAST CREATES AN ALTERNATE TIME CONTINUUM. THOSE ARE THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE HYPOTHETICAL FICTIONAL REALITIES. WHY WOULD IT BENEFIT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN 2049 TO PREVENT THE LEADER OF THE RESISTANCE FROM BEING BORN? JUST CONTINUE KILLING THE HUMANS NOW!!!
3. THERES NO BEGINNING OR END? HOW CAN YOU BE ALIVE TO SEND SOMEONE INTO THE PAST WHO UNTIL HE IS YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER. THAT MEANS TIME IS AN INFINITE LOOP AND FUTURE AND PAST ARE RELATIVE AND ITS DUMB.

259,luke-a-mcgowan,Classic horror/thriller/action hybrid,9,8 March 2016,"A classic Blockbuster, The Terminator plays more like a horror film than the action film franchise that it spawned. Schwarzenegger owns the whole movie with his minimal dialogue and enormous presence. Its amazing that with only fourteen lines of dialogue he became one of the most quotable characters of all time. He carries all of his weapons like extensions of his own arms and remains completely deadpan at all times. The acting of the movie is carried by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, both of whom do an excellent job of their roles. Hamilton is a sweet but scared young woman on the run from something she doesn't understand. Biehn is a young soldier from a time far from now, with PTSD licking at the edges of his consciousness. The way Reese looks at heavy machines with apprehension is a tiny thing that speaks volumes, as is the non-existent reactions to deaths of his fellow soldiers in present day. Cameron's screenplay is a marvel, full of incredible dialogue and one of the best plot twists in cinema history. Whilst most of the visual effects are quite dated, they far from ruin the movie and the animatronic head of Schwarzenegger is certainly impressive for its time. The way Cameron cuts the movie around R-rated violence and unavailable visual effects (putting sunglasses on, brilliant!) actually contributes to the film's cult thriller status. I don't know why Schwarzenegger was given a posh combover at the start, but it is quickly messed up, and the film's score has lots of impressive horror moments but is probably better suited to this film than the very action-heavy Terminator theme we are used to today.",The Terminator
260,moviewiz-4,Okay but not a pleasant one,7,16 March 2001,"This movie is not as good compare to the second series. Maybe because of the effects and music which are not up to the standard, very dull. Some of the story in this movie is out of the point, irrelevant. At first it is ok but finally it become quite hard to understand.The action is ok. Too bad Arnold doesn't speak much in this movie, only when his character is able to change the voice. The T2 movie probably do not relate to the first part in some way.",The Terminator

262,Quebec_Dragon,Review from first-time watcher after seeing Terminator Salvation,8,4 June 2009,"I had seen numbers 2 and 3 of the series but not this one and so was interested in going back to the origins after watching the latest installment. I understand now why it was critically praised and strong enough to launch a franchise. It also helped very much into understanding some aspects of the last film. Actually, the first Terminator struck me at how internally logical it was in its fictional concept which is not an easy thing to do considering the inherent pratfalls whenever time travel is involved. It just consistently made sense compared to the plot holes of Salvation.The action was obviously much lower-budget but it felt right and it looked good. The director James Cameron filmed some very effective stunts that still hold up today. You could always tell what was going on and follow the action. The terminator was an imposing menacing presence. Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role played it without showing any emotion (which makes sense) while his massive physique, ponderous movements and plastic looks (he does look artificial sometimes!) sell the character. You could nitpick that the head of Arnold was obviously replaced by a fake head sometimes (mirror scene) but weirdly it kinda worked anyway into making him more creepy. The other main roles, Sarah Connor and Reese, were played just right showing enough emotion without going into overexagerated melodrama. They were believable and likable. When reviews of Salvation complain about lack of heart, you get it more when you see the characterizations and character development here (even more so after Terminator 2).Since I already knew most of the twists, from having seen the later movies, it is difficult for me to comment on them. However, I must say they were well implemented and must surely have been effective back then. The story was quite interesting and the glimpses of the future were particularly engrossing. The soundtrack sometimes seemed a bit weak with the synthesizers but one should see it as a ""time capsule"" of the eighties (time the movie takes place and when it was filmed) and basically it fits with the haircuts and wardrobes of the time. It's worth a rental as a piece of sci-fi action history or a purchase if you're a James Cameron, Schwarzenegger or Terminator fan. Be careful of which edition you get as some versions with extras do exist. Rating: 8 out of 10",The Terminator
263,adampkalb,A very fun romp through chase scenes by an evil robot from the future.,10,28 October 2021,"I thought it was pretty cool how The Terminator premiered in the same year as another slasher film, A Nightmare on Elm Street. However, that movie is supernatural horror while this is science fiction horror. In The Terminator, the plot is always on the move - just like the main characters trying to get away from the T-800. Kyle Reese told Sarah Connor all she needs to know about the future he is from and the Terminator while he is driving her away from the Terminator. Arnold Schwarzenegger was worried that playing a villain would be terrible for his acting career, but he turned out to like playing the bad guy for once and he had the right body to play a strong robot who looked like a human. However, his one condition for James Cameron getting him back for Terminator 2 was that his T-800 character would become the hero protecting Sarah Connor from a new Terminator villain. In the 1-hour ""Other Voices"" documentary from the The Terminator DVD, I learned that Linda Hamilton really broke her ankle during filming, which meant all of her running scenes were filmed late in the schedule, and that made the peril of those moments feel even more real to me when I know why Sarah was having a hard time running away from a huge truck and carrying Kyle Reese at the same time.",The Terminator

265,geminiredblue,I'll Be Back!,10,9 June 2015,"Over the years, James Cameron has made quite a name for himself. Especially in terms of ""sci-fi"" and ""action/ adventure"" movies. But long before TITANIC, AVATAR, and ALIENS, he came up with this original idea. In the not-too-distant future (now anyway), a nuclear war has taken place between the world superpowers. In the wake of the fallout, homicidal machines have risen up; attempting to exterminate the human race. In a desperate effort, the machines have built a time machine and sent a nearly-indestructible cyborg assassin, The Terminator (played icily by Arnold Schwarzenegger), back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance. To protect her, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) a future soldier is sent back through time as well. Combining the best parts of horror, sci-fi, action, and crime drama, James Cameron keeps the movie going at a blistering pace without sacrificing the compelling (and necessary) human story. In many ways, this film was (and still is) a classic from the 80's. Now with TERMINATOR GENISYS due out in the theaters this summer, maybe it's time you go back in time and see how the series all began!",The Terminator
266,stormhawk2021,A big masterpiece of the sci-fi genre,10,14 July 2017,"A masterful science-fiction thriller and action directed by great novice James Cameron (formerly directed only ""Piranha 2"") and starring the great Arnold Schwarzenegger in what was possibly the role of his life, it is simply magnificent as the Killing machine whose name gives title to the film. There are also great Mike Biehn (regular in Cameron's films), Linda Hamilton (this was his 6th film), Lance Henriksen (""Aliens""' robot Bishop) and Paul Winfield (the judge in ""Presumed Innocent"").An unknown Bill Paxton plays a small role as the Punk leader who dies at the hands of the T-800. This was his first collaboration with Jim Cameron, later he would make 4 more films with him.Also noteworthy are the special effects of Stan Winston and Gene Warren of Fantasy II, especially the endoskeleton (the Terminator without skin). The movie would have lost a lot if it had not shown the endoskeleton, it was the final surprise that Cameron had prepared.It was obvious that the Terminator had to be shown without the living tissue, since the great majority of the public was very curious and hoped to see what was inside Schwarzenegger, especially when one sees the ""operation"" of the eye and arm, the public I knew Arnold had ""something"" and wanted to see it.Also noteworthy are the excellent soundtrack of Brad Friedel, as well as some eighties songs from TryangleZ (""Photoplay"" or ""Burnin' in the Third Degree"") or Lin Van Hek (""Intimacy"").The movie is very, very entertaining from beginning to end, an undisputed masterpiece of science fiction that must be seen (if not 100, 100,000 times) before dying.It followed an excellent continuation (T2: judgment day) with a less convincing Terminator, but with some incredible special effects and the ridiculous Terminator 3: rise of the machines, with an aging Schwarzenegger.Terminator is UNIQUE.I thank God that I am alive so I can see this movie again. I can not get enough of seeing her, it's impossible.A DESERVED 10.",The Terminator
267,tburke85,Terminator A Good Sci-Fi Film With Some Flaws,7,12 June 2009,"The Terminator is a good sci-fi film with some flaws but it does have a compelling story, plenty of action, character development, suspense, great special effects especially for that time, and solid performances by the whole cast. I did prefer T2 and most recently Terminator Salvation over this one but the original is still a good film. Writer/Director James Cameron the man behind films like Titanic, True Lies, Alien 2, and the upcoming Avatar showed a real talent as a filmmaker with this movie which was his second one back then. Cameron is one of the best writer/directors out there and he continues to prove just that with every one of his movies. The cast are great in their roles bringing to life these imaginary characters Cameron created for the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic in the title role. He may not have many lines and his screen time is cut a little short near the end well sort of Schwarzenegger still proves to be an effective villain. He was born to play The Terminator a ruthless cyborg from the future that will stop at nothing until it's mission is complete. Michael Biehn is equally impressive as time traveler Kyle Reese from the future. He gets just as much screen time if not a little more than Schwarzenegger and Biehn makes the best of his role as the hero in the movie. He brings an intensity to his performance which makes his believable as a time traveler whose mission is to protect Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton. She's also very good in the role of Sarah an ordinary woman who must find the strength within herself to stop the Terminator before he kills her. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but they're not given much to do and really any screen time to leave an impression. The whole story of the film would take me forever to fully explain so I'm not going to get into it. It's better to just watch the Terminator before knowing too much what the movie is about before any spoilers could ruin the experience. The action is pretty much non-stop making the film move at a steady pace as the main characters are introduced and the chase begins to get to Sarah Connor first. All the crashes, explosions, chases, fights, and narrow escapes are well executed most of them looking very realistic. The special effects are state of the art especially for movies back then considering they didn't have the technology available today. The few flashback sequences with Reese showing a post Judgment Day are just as good. The world is an apocalyptic wasteland overrun by machines bent on annihilating the human race. Despite some flaws with the dialogue occasionally, answered questions, and somewhat rushed love story although it had to happen or else John Connor wouldn't exist, The Terminator is still a solid sci-fi film. It's much better than other ones out there like Ultraviolet, Babylon A.D., or Aeon Flux to name a few no offense. Overall The Terminator is an entertaining sci-fi adventure definitely worth watching with plenty of action, great special effects, thrills, suspense, drama, some humor, a little romance, and terrific performances by the cast.",The Terminator
268,revival05,"Classic movie, even though the sequel was better.",8,19 April 2000,"''The Terminator'' is a masterpiece. It might not be very much of a ''cinema art'' experience but it sure is entertaining. The actors are perfect ( who can say Schwarzenegger isn't doing a bad job here ) and Cameron gets a great start as a director. Cameron did many good movies later on ( ''Aliens'' and ''Titanic'' of course included ), but his greatest work ever has got to be ''Terminator 2''. It's a lot better, but to be on the safe side, watch this movie first. 8.5 out of 10.",The Terminator

A terminator from the future to kill a woman who is soon going to have a baby that, apparently, the terminator does not want.  The bar scene was really cool.

270,mardalsfossen01,"A classic of it's genres; legendary role for Arnie and so much fun to watch, but doesn't make any sense in the end.",7,18 February 2020,"Some things just don't add up, like one man (John Connor) being responsible for the upcoming victory over the cyborgs or the paradox that he only exists because his own father, who's a friend of his in the future, volunteers to travel back in time to breed him in the first place. This literally doesn't make sense if you think about it.But putting this aside, this is a very entertaining and pioneering Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller for it's time. Perfect role for Arnold ""I'll be back"" Schwarzenegger.Also considering the plot, they should've just stopped making more movies of this franchise after this one because it already doesn't make sense here and only gets worse. I guess they said 'screw it', because Arnie was made for this role and watching cyborgs fight is just fun and it sells well. Bummer the plot is a mess, solely of them not thinking this time travel thing through, else I would've become a real fan of this franchise.",The Terminator
271,johnsmithjanuary-20081,great movie,10,1 August 2021,"Really good movie if you can get past some of the cheesy ""CGI effects"" throughout some of the action scenes. Crazy to think Schwarzenegger was already 37 years for his breakthrough film!",The Terminator
272,Jerique,Cameron's worst movie? Perhaps.,1,30 October 2007,"Terminator is relatively slow for the first 20 minutes. We are quickly introduced to Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She seems like a nobody (which she pretty much is for the most part - aside from birthing her son).The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) searches for her since there seems to be quite a few of Sarah Connor's. After finally finding the correct one, he goes on the chase and Sarah tries to hide figuring that she could be killed if found.Meanwhile, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) shows up from the future. He explains the Terminator is also from the future and is a cybernetic organism. He explains that Sarah's not-born-yet son John Connor is the leader of the rebel army to face the machines. Sarah and Kyle fall in love, somehow, quickly and show it by having sex. Sarah gets pregnant and survives the Terminator attack (this really isn't a spoiler since there is two sequels).Now, at this point you are probably wondering why I titled it as I did. Sure, it sounds interesting. But, Back To The Future makes sense. This is just ridiculous. A guy comes from the future and has a kid with a woman. Think about it. Doesn't that sound over the top? It will continue to happen the same way, thats how time traveling works.The story, however, is not the worst part of the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger says nearly zero lines. The make-up effects were just dreadful and then you have the special effects. I think for the most part the special effects were dormant. 1977, we saw some amazing special and visual effects from Star Wars. Seven years later, this trash comes out.It was tolerable up till the last 20 minutes. The skeleton was shown and instead of looking scary and realistic, it looked like stop frame animation from Nightmare Before Christmas. I laughed when I first saw this and I was thinking to myself: 'Linda must have hated this part.' It's like running away from air, and screaming at nothing. Must have been difficult to portray. The sequel definitely beats the original by a long shot. The good news about this movie is: James Cameron's career was not ruined by it, thankfully. Titanic, Terminator II, and Aliens all kept it alive.If you are a die-hard Terminator fan or Arnold fan, you'll watch this just for the fact of watching it. But if you're any fraction like me, you won't enjoy it and it will probably never grace your DVD/VCR ever again - unless you have a Terminator marathon.",The Terminator
273,Rindiana,"""I'll Be Back."" And He Was Right!",8,18 November 2009,"Surprisingly well-made and memorable sci-fi action pic, helped immensely by the effective clean-cut storyline, Cameron's muscular direction, a haunting atmosphere and well-staged scenes of violence and destruction.And the role of a tight-lipped killer cyborg from the future suits Arnold's acting abilities to a T.Definitely superior to the much higher budgeted overblown sequel.A minor genre classic... and one of the very few really good Arnie vehicles.8 out of 10 belly-bursting fist moves",The Terminator
274,AndreiPavlov,"Do we really have to take this ""Emmanuelle"" crap in order to know?",10,25 April 2006,"A good and reliable film. Without children-oriented atmosphere of its sequel and without CGI-oriented smell of its blockbuster let's-have-some-fun sequel's sequel. Have seen it quite a number of times during these 15 years and it still does not wear out.The vocabulary of the cyborg is very curt and mature. So is the movie. The effects are restrained but notably to the point. The dark atmosphere is superb. The shootout in the police department is not bad at all. It is a real highlight.Bad thing is a sex scene. Do we really have to take this ""Emmanuelle"" crap in order to know that this soldier is the father of the future John? It should have been moved to the deleted scenes (can't help mentioning ""First Blood"" as a pure example of a very clever move in a similar case). Absence of this (as well as some verbal hints) would have added more mystery (like ""Is that man the father of John Connor or not?""). A pair of additional bloody fist fights or shoot-out scenes instead would have been quite nice though.Still, cannot give it a lower mark - it is a very rare example of tough revolutionary cinema.

275,illbebackreviews,"As much as I love T2, for me Terminator was a little better!",9,26 November 2012,"Like the title to this review said, I have vastly enjoyed both 'Terminator' and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day'. Despite T2 being regarded Cameron's best film and the best of the series I personally enjoyed 'Terminator' a little more. I really loved the simplistic story, the acting was amazing and seeing our beloved Arnold Schwarzenneger play the bag guy, cyborg, was completely badass and awesome. Arnie was more enjoyable in the original because he seemed terrifying. The scenes where he gets shot, but just rises up were breathtaking. The acting, the dialogue and story were brilliant. One issue with the film, and the only I find, is the special effects in some scenes such as the cyborg's mask. It was obviously fake but it doesn't strike me that hard. In fact, by the end of the movie I can completely forget about the bad FX in that scene. The action was brilliant, the direction and pacing were flawless and like I said before, Arnie playing a BAMF is a little cooler than him playing a protector. Absolutely legendary film, and extremely underrated!",The Terminator

Schwarzenneggar makes this film and this is his best performance in a film in my opinion.The Terminator machine is sent back to the year 1984. His purpose, to kill Sarah Conner and prevent her from giving birth to her son who will go on to lead humans to victory over the machines. Kyle Reese, a human, also gets sent back to the same year in order to protect Sarah from The Terminator.The Terminator is one of the greatest villains ever. Relentless, he only has one purpose in this film, to kill Sarah Conner. He has no emotion or care for anything or anyone. Completely cold and evil machine. Schwarrzenneggar does such a great job of portraying him, he really moves and acts like a cybornetic machine would. Awesome villain and portrayal in this film. I like Arnold better in this villain role than in the hero role he plays in the sequels to The Terminator.Also I liked the acting and characters of Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner. Reese is a great character to play the military guy intent on protecting Conner. Linda Hamilton does great as Sara Conner and really does a good job playing the women who goes from being scared and weak to being a strong woman who is able to protect herself.The setting is great. I really like how most of the film takes place during the night, giving it a dark feel. ALso love how whenever The Terminator is on screen there is the sound of a deep drum beating continuously. That just adds to the setting and also makes The Terminator to seem like an evil thing.THe action is great. Car chases, attacks in clubs and police stations, and a chase through a factory at night. It just is great action.To conclude, I think this is easily the best of the Terminator Franchise. Great villain, tone and setting, and acting. Recommended to the highest.",The Terminator

James Cameron's haunting cinematography, great actor performances and above all, a brilliant baddie make this a memorable film. Arnold Schwarzenegger almost doesn't feel human anyway, so in this movie he's perhaps showing off a characteristic that you don't find in just any actor.What still makes this movie extremely worth-while too is the excellent soundtrack. Though done entirely on a synthesizer, it sounds brilliant and fits the action like a glove. Big props to Brad Fiedel. Also, unlike some other typically violent movies, this one keeps everything fresh and doesn't become boring or repetitive. The relentless grind of the Terminator's hunt gives the film a truly successful feeling of suspense.A unique film and a stand-out product of the 1980s.",The Terminator

The special effects are amazing (mild complaint to the fully-exposed Terminator though) and everything is nice to see. The plot is pretty complex but works greatly and a nice one at that. I found myself intrigued of the near future and the possibilities of what could come. The action sequences left me at the edge of my seat and had actual suspense building up inside me. I could feel my adrenaline level going up high whenever the Terminator showed up on the screen. The story also presents a slowly built love story that will tie-in with the sequel. Although not being the main theme of the movie, it plays a big part of the other movies as I can tell. This highly intelligent action-thriller is great and seeing that the second film has a way higher score than this one, I am completely ready! 9/10.",The Terminator
281,antagonist117,An icon of its time and for all time,9,30 September 2014,"""The Terminator"" is two things that are very good to be: a movie that is of its time, and a movie for all time. From the opening minutes it is almost fetishistically contemporary. A superimposed text says the events of the film take place ""tonight,"" a rather hokey tactic, most often seen in the horror genre, that may create a sense of immediacy for some first-run viewers but that becomes increasingly ironic as time takes its toll on the fashion, the music, the hair, and so on. ""Terminator""'s first act is an onslaught of such tell-tale signs of the time, and the time in question is peak 1980s. This is not a bad thing. The movie so successfully captures the spirit of its era that later movies set in its milieu often appear to be, and in many cases undoubtedly are, copying it. It wasn't the first movie to take place in fume- and trash-filled urban alleys and neon-lit dance clubs, or to feature independent women who do things like have sex and ride motorcycles without prompting censure or even comment, but it was arguably the best and best-looking and most influential movie to do these things at this time. In other words, it is an icon of 1980s film.It is also an icon of film generally. It accomplished that even grander feat through a combination of brilliant achievements. First, the casting, particularly of Arnold Schwarzenegger. His early acting career benefited enormously from the existence of roles that nobody else could have played quite as well. Conan the Barbarian was a near-Neanderthal: strong, serious, a mythic figure of great stature and few words. The Terminator is the same, though he kills for different reasons. Arnold is menacing, darkly funny, and extremely cool in the role, all at once. Second, the script. It serves timeless lines on a silver platter for Schwarzenegger and the other two leads, and they all three seem to know exactly what to do with them. They take soundbytes and throw them at us like sticks of dynamite, and when they land we feel them: ""Come with me if you want to live,"" ""I'll be back,"" and ""You're terminated, f*cker."" (The last one is another reminder that we're in the 1980s, a long-ago time when action and sci-fi movies were sometimes made for adults, not just teens. The language here is strong, the violence is not all bloodless, and the sex is very much on- screen.) Third, a time-travel plot that is unusually well thought out, capable of being communicated without too much belabored exposition, and that leaves plenty of room for further exploration without raising too many unanswered questions. It is strong conceptual ground on which to build a media empire.Like 1983's ""WarGames"" (which also featured a motorcycle-riding female lead), the central idea in ""Terminator"" is that computers might one day destroy humanity. Unlike ""WarGames,"" which approached the subject from a software angle and took its cues from real programming concepts, ""Terminator"" casts a tangible piece of hardware in the role of unstoppable stalker killer. This leads to perhaps its only real weakness as a movie. Toward the end, as plot recedes and special effects (mostly stop motion) come to the fore, it begins to feel too much like the horror movies that it echoes in its opening text. The false endings that typify that genre are as predictable as ever, and the Terminator becomes just another riff on Michael Myers. But if the penultimate scenes are derivative, they are nevertheless satisfying, and the film ends on a note that provides closure and leaves you eager for more.",The Terminator

284,Sonatine97,T1 Far Better Than T2,9,4 July 2001,"For me T1 outstrips T2 in many departments, primarily because any sequel that rides off the back of a very successful original will have a bigger budget, more technicians, more scriptwriters, bigger & better sfx etc etc.So it came as no surprise to see that T2 had all these features but at the end of the day it was nothing more than a retread of T1, and as a consequence doesn't fall into the same classic status as its parent.When I first saw T1 back in 1985 I'd hardly heard of Arnie apart from his Conan films. But as the film rolled I immediately began to warm to him as the cold calculating cyborg on a mission to kill his nemesis (sarah Connor) from the past who's future son will change the outcome of a war between humans & cyborgs, something that Arnie, as a T800 cyborg has been returned to the past to prevent.As one would except from a Cameron/Hurd film the action comes thick and fast, but the story & the characterisation isn't forgotten in all the mayhem.The lead protaganists, Connor (Hamilton), Reese (Biehn) and of course Arnie, do a very good job with their characters. Ok, so Arnie doesn't get round to saying too much, probably because of his Austrian accent being a little too thick for American audiences to take on board. However, his accent is perfect for the T800,adapting to the world of 1984.There are many great moments in the film and of course there are one two classic quotes that will go down in cinema history, such as ""I'll Be Back!!"" and ""F**k You, ***hole!"". you just have to watch the movie to understand how those quotes fit perfectly into the story!It was interesting that Arnie very much wanting to play the badguy in T800. Perhaps he felt at the time that this would be his big chance to get into the Hollywood limelight - and boy did it pay off in spades.T1 is good on video but is even better on DVD. You can still see the small budget in this film and there are a lot of sfx that look quite basic, as well as positively visible. However, that was all to change when T2 came along and a new generation of cgi & morphing made audiences' jaws drop in amazement.But for the gee-whizz sfx of T2 I would recommend T1 first and foremost. Its a great film and has a cult following too. We will have to see what T3 has to offer next year, but T1 will still be way ahead of the crowd.****/*****",The Terminator

286,gritfrombray-1,Truly amazing,10,5 November 2006,"Absolute perfection as a stand alone movie. The whole idea was brilliant. It seemed as though they'd never run far enough! Arnold was perfectly cast as were the rest of this cracking cast. Fear is a hard thing to generate in a movie and this one had it in bucket loads! Definitely one of the best science fiction films of the '80s. Arnie's lack of dialog was a brilliant idea. His sole reasons for being there were made obvious by this. No nonsense prattle which I believe ruins movies. Watch the sequels to see what I mean. Fantastic movie, a must see. The only complaint I have is why oh why were sequels made. Usually sequels are made to enhance the original. Not so in this case. Have only just seen the cuts which were on the bonus disc. Oh wow. They really set it up for the sequel. Still, this is by far the best one.....",The Terminator
287,dormesher-21565,Classic....,9,13 October 2019,"The Terminator. What an absolute classic and one of my favourite movies of all time. The story is brillaint and told in a simple way and dosent complicate it.
The characters are amazing and brilliantly acted.This is just an awesome with so many iconic moment.
Yes some moments are dated like when The Terminator is doing surgery on himself and when we see the skeleton of the terminator at the end the stop motion dosent age well.However the rest of the movie looks fantastic still to this day especially the scenes showing the war in the future they are really well shot.The characters are amazing especially Sarah Conner you can tell that this innocent woman is one day going to be badass even in this film especially towards to the end you can see the character growing when she realises how important she is.Kyle Reece is great character and the love story between these two characters is really well done.Arnold is great in this film and The Terminator is just badass my favourite moment is the Police Station scene where he's killing everyone such a great moment showing a non stop killer great action moment.Verdict 9.8/10 a classic film with amazing characters and a fantastic story some dated effects but still a classic movie that is still iconic.",The Terminator
288,therskybznuiss,T1 or T2 take your pic.,9,15 June 2021,"Just like Alien/s, this movie or the sequel; it's a take your pic sort of scenario.I like 2 subjectively, as it was the first one that I saw.For the perfectly realized world, the grittiness of the theme and the setting and overall presentation, I think that this is the better movie.Just about everything was perfect in this one, and I think back to the 80's when this was all that the viewer had and question of 'Is Kyle Reese really who he says he is, or was his insanity so compelling and contagious that it spreads to Sarah Connor?'That's a major premise of T2, and also what makes me remember this was the not just the series, but Sci-Fi and storytelling from that era at it's best, most suspenseful, and I just wish more series' took inspiration from the innovation instead of from the T-101.",The Terminator
289,L_Copa,A must classic for all Future generations!,9,3 October 2019,"James Cameron with Arnold Schwarzenegger achieved to make the impossible in a time of middle CGI, sci fi, and technology! That is making a story, with perfect directing and acting, pure bad-ass action with manly quotes and moves! It is one thing that we always joke about, about the machines and here it is presented as the beginning of all. Sarah Conor is magnificent at this role. It is a movie that we re all gonna see repeatedly in our lives. It is the definition of the word classic. So... Nice night for Terminator!!! ( for a walk)",The Terminator
290,robsta23,"""I'll be Back"" makes me Excited to Watch Judgment Day Again",8,6 April 2015,"This is a good science-fiction movie, and I especially like the paradox which involves the birth and existence of John Connor. Arnold Schwarzenegger is good as the titular character since his role calls for the acting skills he can provide: the acting skills needed for a robot.The premise is simpler than I expected it to be: kill Sarah Connor to prevent the birth of a hero named John Connor. Sadly, there is not much characterization coming from Sarah Connor until the last few minutes of the movie. It is disappointing that the focus of the film is on Schwarzenegger since poor special effects make up the terminator's face once he tears his own eyeball out.Sadly this film is nowhere on the same scale as the sequel, but I guess being made 7 years earlier, this movie was bound to have lesser special effects than the 2nd one. But it is not just the special effects; like Alien being compared to Aliens, this film just has less action due to less extras (in this case, less police) than the sequel, which makes for a less exciting adventure movie.I didn't mind the movie, but I don't see all the fuss about why this is so iconic. I have more interest in the characters as well as the action in Judgment Day. Finally, I have to say it is really cool how The Terminator is both on the top 50 villains and top 50 heroes lists according to AFI.",The Terminator
291,freaky_dave,The Terminator is a great science fiction film that crosses into other genres as well,10,1 March 2006,"The Terminator, one of James Cameron's greatest films, has everything that you could look for in a movie. It has romance, science fiction, horror, and action all rolled into one fantastic film. There isn't much let up, much like Aliens, a film made two years later and also one of his best.Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton in one of her best roles) has no idea what's in store for her. She a waitress just trying to get by, but her life's about to be turned upside down. Unknown to her in the present she is, in the not too distant future, going to give birth to a son named John Connor who will be an influential leader in the year 2029 and help the rebels defeat the machines and the super computer Skynet.Skynet knows this and sends one of it's virtually indestructible cyborgs (Arnold Swarzennegger in his greatest role) back to Sarah Connor's present to kill her before she can conceive. However the rebels have sent one of their own back to protect her, a man named Reese (Michael Biehn). What follows is one of the most creative concepts for a movie. This movie is filled with almost non-stop action, and on top of all that it is a romance as well as a science fiction or horror movie. Take your pick.The acting in this film is great, and Cameron's pacing is perfect in that he knows when to slow down and when to pick it back up. My only problem with the movie was some of the special effects now seem dated. However, you got to realize that this movie was made back in 1984, so I can forgive it that much.This is one of my favorite films, and it is probably Swarzennegger's best movie to date. Yes I like Terminator 2, but it wasn't quite as good as the original even though the special effects had, of course, improved.Some of the concepts of time seem a little much. But you have to realize that this is, at its heart, mainly a science fiction film, and one of the best ever made. I loved it and would recommend it to anybody.",The Terminator
292,kingofdanerds,A timeless classic,10,19 August 2020,"Ah yes the original Terminator film of 1984. It is sometimes hard to write a review for a film where lots has been said. My opinion of this film is an opinion known by many as many people share the same I opinion I have. Yes, The Terminator is one of the best films I have ever seen.The Terminator was directed and written by James Cameron who was not very well known at the time. Of course, now these days he is often considered by many to be one of the greatest movie directors of all time with movies like Titanic, Avatar, and Aliens just to name a few. The film notably stars Arnold Schwarzenegger ,who had previously starred in the Conan movies, as the killer cyborg. The film also stars Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn whose carrers would start thanks to this film. The film had a some what small budget of 6 million dollars and was a box office hit upon release and the film was popular enough to spawn sequels.The film is about a war that happened in the future (2029). It was a war between man and machine. The world is a wasteland and the humans take refuge and fight for their lives. The humans are lead by John Connor and the machines are not happy with that so they send a cyborg back in time to the year 1984 to prevent the existence of John Connor by killing his mother before he is born. The humans send a protector to protect Sarah Connor. What we get is over an hour and a half of fast paced, sci fi action.I just love everything about this film. First, the music. Brad Fiedel created one of the best theme songs ever to be put in a movie and not just the main theme, but the whole soundtrack. Each song works well with their scenes. Second, the overall tone. The tone of this film is dark, with most of the scenes taking place at night. It gives a sense of not knowing what the future holds for anybody. You see people living their lives not knowing that the world will be a wasteland. Third, the action scenes. While the sequels are more heavy on action, this film tends to be sci fi heavy. That is not to say that there isn't action because there is plenty of it. Everything from the Tech-Noir scene, the Police Station scene, even the big chase scene and the film's finale are all truly spectacular. There is never a dull moment. Fourth, the ability to hold my attention at all times. Every single bit of this film holds my attention. When Kyle has his flashbacks, I want to know about what his time is like and by showing me what it is like, the film has got my attention. Other great things include the acting. Arnold Schwarzenegger does a fantastic job as the Terminator. He truly is menacing and quite scary in fact. Even Bill Paxton does a great job even though he had the smallest part in the film! The effects of this film are great as well. Certain effects have not aged entirely well but I tend to overlook that because they were impressive for the time and do remember that the film was on a 6 million dollar budget.In conclusion, The Terminator is a timeless classic that excels in every aspect. I think the Library of Congress said it best when this film was selected for preservation for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Terminator is entertaining from start to finish with suspense, sci fi action, and a fantastic story overall.",The Terminator
293,kyle-cruse,Classic,9,19 August 2008,"""The Terminator"" is a classic 80s action movie. Yes, it's a bit cheesy, the special effects are obviously fake now, and there isn't a huge amount of character development in this film, but it's still the best of this series, in my opinion. This is considered to be a low budget film, as most of the stars were unknowns at the time. Now that Arnold Schwarzeneggar is a huge star (as well as governor), the film can be looked at somewhat as the beginning of a career. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is rescued from the Terminator by Kyle Reese, a man from the future who knows that Connor's son John will lead the rebellion against the takeover by robots in the future. The rest of the film consists of the two of them trying to escape this Terminator and the events that will result in John Connor's birth. It's still a great film, and the best of this series so far, even though it doesn't have great visual effects. There are good performances from the entire cast, and there are tons of humorous bits throughout the film that lighten up such a suspenseful, frightening story. ""Terminator 2"" is an impressive sequel, but because I feel it is overly violent, I'm not going to rate it higher than this film.***1/2 out of ****",The Terminator
294,springsunnywinter,"The best of the best movies ever on the planet, galaxy & the entire universe",10,21 August 2007,"The Terminator simply has to be my number 1 favourite movie of all time. When the first time I saw the film I fell in love with it about 15 years ago. The truly original idea of the story-line is amazing about a cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor, a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector - Kyle Reese - also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah. The movie was emotionally & psychologically thrilling and made so dark & sinister that give the tensive mood for the film. A well made for 80's film and I was surprised when I heard that it made with a budget of $6.4 million because it looks more expensive e.g. the nuclear war in Los Angeles 2029. I loved every second of it and the best scenes are:1. When the terminator killed Ginger & her boyfriend.2. Shootout at the nightclub (A classic scene in film history).3. Self surgery on his wrist & eye.4. Shootout at the police station.5. When the terminator was driving the lorry.6. When he unexpectedly rose from the fire as an endoskeleton after that it was a nail biting experience to the end.The line ""I'll be back"" is simply the best quote for any film because the audience never expected his position of coming back. Although it is on the IMDb top 250 but it should have been No 1 top place because I have never seen a better movie than this. I've seen it about 100 times and I'm still not fed up. The Terminator gave me the passion about films and my verdict is 1000, 000/10. It's nearly about 25 years old and people still watch it. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London, Gremlins, A Nightmare in Elm Street & Predator, the list is endless. Anyway no matter whatever happens there will never be a better film than The Terminator.",The Terminator

296,MF210,The film that introduced James Cameron,8,7 September 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****.The Terminator introduced James Cameron to critics and moviegoers, and was the start to a pretty decent career. The Terminator will mostly entertain you, even though its flawed. Cameron had enough talent to make it a watchable movie.The acting is pretty good. Arnold Schwarzenegger isnt bad as the Terminator, but i dont think he has enough of a bad presence to be a truly great bad guy, hes better as a hero. Linda Hamilton is solid as Sarah Connor. Michael Biehn is fine. They have enough chemistry to make their relationship seem believable. I feel The Terminator's pace is a bit off in a few areas, I dont know why. The Terminator effects still look decent, though nothing compared to the state of the art effects we have now. Cameron does a good job for one of his first times behind the camera. This is definitely not Cameron's best film, but it was a good start to his career.",The Terminator
297,mgruebel,Splendid low budget entertainment,8,30 July 2015,"Gale Anne Hurd and John Cameron really showed how to deliver a whole lot of movie on a shoestring budget. With a budget so tight that ""bandit"" re-shooting of scenes was necessary while evading the local sheriff, the producer/director team launched Schwarzenegger into his action career in a way that ""Conan"" had not quite been able to do.It was a stroke of genius that Arnold insisted on playing not the hero but the bad robot, sent back from the future to kill the human heroine who might otherwise have a son who would vanquish the machines one day in the future. As a result, ""The Terminator"" had to be changed from a crowd-blender concept to the Arnold-size concept that ""will be back"" with big mayhem and does not try to hide or blend.Linda Hamilton did an incredible job of morphing from pink-dressed diner waitress to steely woman of action whose progeny must save the world of the future. Schwarzenegger developed great affects, like the scanning eyes, to make his character seem less human. And Biehn was a good hero, although he was in the shadow of his monosyllabic adversary. Some of the special effects have not aged well. Unlike Carpenter in ""The Thing,"" Cameron could not afford to eliminate stop-motion sequences from the film entirely. There just was not a budget for large scale puppetry, the only alternative at the time. Many fans would stone me for saying this, but The Terminator is a good candidate for CGI-ing Stan Winston's vision, if it's done right: following the original shots exactly, without fooling around, while making all motions smooth, and rubbery prostheses more realistic. The cigarette smoke that was blown through the crushed exoskeleton in the closing scenes does not need to be redone!The plot occasionally wanders a bit, and Cameron is not quite as good a composer as he might think he is, but this film is a true auteur work at the highest level, hampered to an ""8"" only by the tiny budget. Hurd and Cameron were a match made in heaven (and for a while, on Earth). Action film fans should be grateful to this duo for all eternity.",The Terminator
298,axlrhodes,"The Terminator has heart. Cameron might be well advised,less is more.",10,28 January 2011,"Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",The Terminator
299,CrassActionHero,One of the best movies. A true classic.,8,27 August 2006,"The Terminator 1984. Orion Pictures.Review: The Terminator has one of the best stories out there. In the distant future, a cyborg has been sent back in time to stop the one that changed everything, and she does not even know it. This is an engaging, thrilling, chilling, and a wonderful movie experience. Arnold's performance as the Terminator is one of his best performances ever. Arnold is the perfect villain here. He's cold, unfeeling, menacing, evil, and kills without hesitation. Arnold's facials are also awesome. The Terminator is sent back to 1984 to follow it's prime directive: Terminate Sarah Connor, and will terminate anyone who will try to stop him. Micheal Biehn is great as Reese. The one man sent to stop the Terminator. The story unfolds, and it's gets better with character and plot development. Listen well. The action is well done and keeps you pumped. It also takes Sarah a while to finally be convinced that a evil machine has been sent to kill her. I also like it when the Terminator's skin begins to tear off and you can see the red eye's glow and metal skull. Cool visual. The Last Word: Awesome. Remains a timeless classic.

300,sandnair87,You Will Sure Wish The Terminator is Back!,9,28 April 2015,"In the not-too-distant future, machines rule the Earth and are locked in combat with a gallant band of freedom fighters led by their leader John Connor. Soon a murderous cyborg the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - a remorseless, relentless bogeyman with a bone- crushing steel skeleton and a soul-piercing red diode glare - is sent back in time from the future to kill the mother of the as-yet- unborn leader of the human rebellion. Back in present-day Los Angeles, his mother – a timorous pushover waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) - is unaware of her role in the struggles to come, until the arrival of our titular terminator, whose only purpose is to kill her and thereby change the future. Her only hope is a bashful guerrilla fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who has followed the T-800 back through time to prevent her death and evade any and all attacks from the killer cyborg, while gradually forming a romance with her throughout the mission to preserve her life. Can the Terminator track Sarah down and change the course of the future?The story is deceptively tricky: In comparison to today's packaged thrillers, this is a surprisingly vicious little film, filled with indiscriminate killings and a rough-edged feel that makes it utterly compelling. James Cameron's direction of the ensuing chaos is masterful, and the characterization of the violence has something agonizingly original about it. He manages to generate maximum excitement from the very first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. What really propels the movie, though, isn't the savagery but a well-written and taut screenplay with a nice eye for sharp detail that doesn't tend to drift off into the occasional ponderous bits. There's real heart and soul here, along with Arnold's best-ever performance - as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength. Hamilton's performance as the bewildered waitress who will unwittingly become the savior of the human race is terrific. Biehn shines as Sarah's knight in shining armor.The Terminator grabs us right away and carries us to the end with roller-coaster action sequences and clever time-travel twists. What it results in is arguably the best science fiction thriller of all time that throttles you with the air of a demented ballet.",The Terminator

302,The_Orenda,One of science fiction's best movies.,10,23 May 2006,"Excellent, excellent film. For being over twenty years old, the effects hold up well. The lovely Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are perfect for their roles. Few movies are better paced as The Terminator boasts some of the finest lines and visuals in film history. I suggest to anyone who is interested in science fiction, that you must watch this movie.It's Los Angeles and 1984. Two beings from the future, one a killing cyborg, the other a skilled fighting human, come to the present seeking the same woman, Sarah Connor. She holds the key to the future in her son, who's not even a thought to her mind before the cyborg starts killing every Sarah Connor in the phone book.What makes Terminator a science fiction classic is how you can compare the movie to real life. Before computers became a mandatory household luxury, there was already a vision that we would overly rely on them and this movie does an excellent job in giving us a fantastic worst-case scenario, playing on our fears and imagination. The scene at the police station is one of my personal favorites. The music is excellent, the direction is sharp, and everyone is in top form. The Terminator is perfect science fiction.",The Terminator

304,fredericksmith1952,Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison,10,7 March 2012,"Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison, James Cameron's dark vision of the future was a launching pad for several careers in Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the height of his career and appearance in 1984, so his size and musculature made him the perfect choice to play the killing machine from the future. Linda Hamilton became a star after a somewhat lackluster career by portraying Sarah Connor, a role she reprises in T2: Judgment Day. Micheal Biehn, a heretofore minor character actor, gained overnight popularity as Kyle Reese and went on to film other action films, including Navy Seals and Aliens. Even Lance Henriksen can claim a large amount of his success on his role as Det. Hal Vukovich, and both Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were seen early in their careers thanks to their brief but memorable roles as the punks who first confront the Terminator.While the special effects were not what we would expect to see now, for 1984 they were exceptional. The mechanical movements of Arnold were timed and precise, and the skeletal movements of the Terminator at the end of the film are matched with his character. There are some disparities in the plot, but those are the normal disparities that come with any time travel story. The action, once we get past the initial introduction of characters, is fast. Even when the action slows, the plot moves forward with a consistency rarely seen in action films, and the on-going development of the characters is well written and acted. Its popularity is apparent, since it has spawned no less that three sequels which manage to cover every question, including how John Conner got the scars across his face. Rated R for sex, language, and violence, older teens will probably not find the solitary scene between Sarah and Kyle too embarrassing, and the younger kids should be in bed. Definitely a collectible for any good collector.",The Terminator

I first saw it at the age of six or seven and unsurprisingly it confused me. A few years later I caught it on TV and loved it. I was browsing through my local videostore a few weeks ago and it caught my eye and brought it. After viewing it again I loved it even more. Arnold Shwartznegger was great as The Terminator, this movie shot him to superstardom. I loved Terminator 2: Judgement day and I liked T3:rise of the machines to a certain extent but none of the sequels had the same impact the original had on me. This in my opinion James Cameron's best work, Aliens and True Lies were good and Titanic I find very overrated.",The Terminator
306,Jamie_Seaton,a fantastic start to a brilliant series of films,10,25 August 2009,"this film without a doubt is one of the greatest eighties films of all time. its dark, stylish and has some awesome action scenes. especially for the budget the film had.Arnold Schwarzenegger does a fantastic job of acting as the terminator that is sent back through time to kill Sarah conner (Linda Hamilton) in 1984. to kill the leader of the future resistance before he was even born, John Conner. so killing Sarah conner before she becomes pregnant would help Cyberdyne systems in the future in taking over the world. but john conner himself in the future sends a mercenary back to 1984 to protect Sarah Conner and destroy the terminator. so the legend of the future (John Conner) will be born. it really is a very well planned story that kept me on the edge of my seat when i first watched it. as i continue to watch the classic over and over again it gets better and better. the music really shows an awesome eighties vibe. the acting is good. the action is fantastic for its time.if you haven't seen this masterpiece i'd definitely pick up a copy if i were you plus the other movies that continue after this one. it really is a film that will be remembered for probably hundreds of years.James Cameron has really made a fantastic job of this timeless classic. he made an even better job of the second one so be sure to watch it if you haven't.............. 10/10.......j.d Seaton",The Terminator
307,schroeder-gustavo,"Dark, Beautiful Masterpiece",10,5 June 2015,"What I think is most impressive about T1 is how much Cameron achieved with a relatively low budget of $6.4 Million. The music is awesome, the shots are beautiful and, although it doesn't hold up as well as T2, it is still a landmark of sci-fi/action cinema that any movie buff needs to see at least once. Many people may think its kind of slow and the low budget shows, but that does not take away the fact that the Terminator is an insanely well directed, masterpiece of cinema with a story so original it is hard to imagine anyone will imagine anything as breathtaking as the wasteland shown in the Terminator Series. I stand by saying T2 is the best in the series, but it is definitely a close one.",The Terminator

Cameron surely nails just about it all in his big debut feature.

The Terminator is still his best role to date. Arnold does a incredible job of playing the unstoppable Terminator. Linda Hamilton was never what you'd call talented and Michael Biehn never saw the success that he deserves.James Cameron's greatest talent lies in creating great setpieces and backdrops for his stories. He also has an eye for action, and The Terminator has plenty of both. The makeup effects are a bit primitive even for the time but they were cool then and they still work now. The Terminator's vision is always been a cool effect to me but it is used sparingly in this film. The action and gunplay are some of the best ever seen in an Arnold or Cameron film and that's saying something. Bottom Line: The Terminator is a classic that doesn't get old and never gets boring. At least when Arnie is onscreen.",The Terminator
310,caseynicholson,Superb in Every Way!,10,26 August 2015,"I have a soft spot in my heart for this film, as it's one that I would watch over and over and over again on VHS with my Dad when I was a kid. Back then the fun of the movie was all in the basic gist of the action scenes and the scariness of Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. Now that I'm all grown up, I appreciate this movie for its being so very well-crafted. For a lot of folks, it's the film's sequel, ""T2: Judgement Day"" that is the memorable blockbuster movie, and I loved T2 when it came out myself. But I really think that the original is the better film overall. It's the perfect blend of sci-fi and horror--many of the scenes could work well with an 80's slasher movie. And yet the film is more than just sci-fi, and certainly more than just horror. It's an engaging tale that makes us care about the characters--even John Connor, who hasn't even been born yet. Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor is fantastic, and the on-screen chemistry between Sarah and Kyle adds to the depth of the film.The thing that I think I like most about this movie is its simplicity. Perhaps by 1984 standards ""The Terminator"" may have been groundbreaking in terms of effects, and I'm sure that the robotic Terminator was a convention that not many people had seen done in such a way at that time. Still, the effects are archaic by today's standards, adding a simplistic feel to the movie. But more important is the fact that the script and the storytelling of the film work in just the right way. This isn't a movie that tries to do too much, even though its narrative would have invited that. The film gives you just enough information about the future world from which its villain has come. The restraint used to make an otherwise very complicated tale into one that is accessible to the audience is what makes this movie so clever. Its pacing, its dialogue, and its script all are simple--and yet they come together into a robust tale that draws you in and makes for a completely enjoyable experience.That said, it's not often that I give a film 10/10 stars, but I feel obliged to for ""The Terminator"". It tells its story in a way that feels perfect, and in so doing leaves us with much to appreciate. It's a truly excellent film.",The Terminator
311,RIK-22,The complete movie,10,23 September 1999,"First of all I'll say that this is my favourite movie.  Granted there are better dramas, films with superior acting and deeper stories, but The Terminator, for me, is the complete movie.You have a clever Sci-fi story, time travel, one of the best villains in movie history, a love story and relentless action.The reason this film really hit the mark for me was when I first saw it.  I was about 15 and saw it on video knowing nothing about it and I was blown away.  For the first time the 'bad guy' didn't tie people up, drag out a death scene only to be thwarted at the minute.  No this finally showed what a true killing machine would do.  There's two great remarks in the film that I only picked up on repeated viewings: ""Stay in a public place and you'll be safe"" and ""There's over 30 cops in this building, what could happen to you"" (sorry not a direct quote words to that affect).  These statements are then blown away as The Terminator just destroys everything that gets in his way.On top of this refreshing callous violence is the wonderfully developed love story between Reece and Connor.  It's so well done that the character interplay takes place at the same time as the main action.I could go on and on as to why I love this film, but I'll leave it there.By the way T2 was such a disappointment when compared to  this. >10/10",The Terminator

The action, suspense, plot, acting, and dialogue is great. The score is great especially the main song. Arnold gives a scary performance as one of my favorite villains The Terminator. Kyle Reese's dialogue when he talks about the future is very well written, and gives you a good impression of how bad it is in the future. The shootout at the police station is great, and shows off how The Terminator is a killing machine.

One of the better (maybe one of the best) sci-fi thriller movies.It's hard to tell the story of Terminator in a few sentences, but here goes: a cyborg killing machine, called a Terminator, is send back in time (from a future in which mankind is almost destroyed completely by robots) to kill the mother of the rebellion leader. By doing so making sure that the robots will win in the future and not the humans. Right after the Terminator a human from the future arrives to stop the Terminator from completing it's mission.Did you get all that? Movies involved with time travel tend to get very complex and difficult, but this is not the case with Terminator. The plot is great and moves at a steady pace. This movie has a really good script and the actors work very nicely with it.They couldn't have picked a more suitable actor for the Terminator then Arnold. He plays one of his best characters in his career, in my opinion. There are so many memorable scenes and lines. In particular the one-liner: ""I'll be back"".I can highly recommend this movie for fans of Sci-Fi and/or thriller movies.

The acting is utterly amazing across the entire movie, the soundtrack is suspenseful is really fitting to the entire mood, the action scenes are well done, the effects are amazing for the 1980's. The entire thing for such a low budget movie works out so well I still can't really believe that this was not a bigger hit in the box office. This movie should have made at least 100 million at the box office if I had to be totally honest on how good it was. I think the plot was really good as well and the time travel was decent enough for what it was for and thankfully it wasn't really all that big of a deal actually. It was just there for the sake of explaining how the characters are all in the same town. And I will say that I do like the whole son subplot and the sex scene showing his conception and how a man from the future is his father.",The Terminator
315,shaun98,Exciting early Cameron,8,8 February 2000,"This is, without a doubt, Arnie's best film. Other actors can portray other terminators, it is true-but only he can play THE Terminator! Granted, he's not the most accomplished actor in the world, but here he makes an imposing presence as an unstoppable killing machine. This is, of course, the one that made him a big star.Likewise, it put James Cameron on the map, representing a fresh start after the universally despised ""Piranha 2"", which is, as of this writing, unseen by me, and likely to remain that way for  a long time, which is probably for the best.It's interesting to notice that ""Terminator"" cost only $6.4 million, yet Cameron wound up making the most expensive movie ever made-you know what I'm talking about! (Otherwise, where have you been the past 100 years?)Putting all that aside, this is sci-fi action in its purest form, never letting up, moving inexorably to a terrifying conclusion!

317,droog-56936,Schwarzenegger Rising,10,31 October 2019,A towering achievement in science fiction filmmaking. The Terminator provided a simple but genius storyline that mixed elements of the genre along with the action movie. Director James Cameron brought this fully realized vision of future technology gone awry and dropped it right in the lap of 1984. This movie made a mega star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger and boosted grounded modern sci fi as the heir apparent to horror. As important as Blade Runner. Along with Aliens the best science fiction of the 80s.,The Terminator
318,Kubris,Man vs. Machine,9,30 July 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 168The Terminator is a great action movie which can be eye candy or thought provoking, depending how you want to see it. At it's core, Terminator is about a violent cyborg trying to kill a woman. But it offers an eerie version of the future, and explores a conflict that was then unused- man vs. machine.First and foremost, Ahnold. He's huge and intimidating, which just a little too much sneer. But accompanied with kickass weapons and a surprisingly good score, he dominates scenes like he was meant to.The action is big, with some really cool scenes and chases. The 80's violence is much better than the 2029 action, which comes off as very cheesy to a modern audience. I can't really criticize though, as I have no idea what the standard was back then. The SFX also can't be criticized, but they haven't aged very well. The metal terminator looks like stop-motion, very jerky and it's distracting.The story is a big winner. Vast, with lots of expansion room, and the plot tells a tight story with a twist. The time travel is very well handled, and reasonably makes sense. I can't wait to see T2 tonight.The Terminator is a really cool action movie with brain and brawn, like District 9, a favourite of mine. As far as 80's action goes, I like the Terminator better than Die Hard. If you find it, see this classic. I'll be back.*Edit- November 26, 2011* I change my opinion about few films. Apocalypse Now, Taxi Driver, and now The Terminator demand a second viewing to see if my opinion really changes. The Terminator is an equal movie to my first viewing. But I realize that I underrated it the first time. The whole 80's-ness of it is awesome, with the punks, the sleazy L.A. streets, Reese's Nike's, tape recorders and Technoir. The music stands out more the second time, as do the hammy lines delivered by Michael Biehn in the first Act. But the future scenes feel a little better. They're really desolate and hopeless. It's hard to describe, this film succeeds more than any other Terminator because of its atmosphere. It's a dark film, but it has heart. Where the sequel goes for the (mostly) more family approach (*shudder*) The Terminator is a pure, unaltered effort for the sake of cinema. It's so fresh. This is my favourite James Cameron film, beating out Aliens. I believe this stands among 80's classics like Back to the Future8.3/10 *Edited score- 8.5/10*",The Terminator

321,robb_772,Genre-defining classic,8,28 July 2006,"Made on a relatively low budget, James Cameron's now-seminal sci-fi/action thriller should be considered a model of efficient film-making. Cameron and his fellow artisans managed to create a tightly-constructed and imaginative film under considerably meager constraints, and yet the finished film remains highly impressive even when viewed some 20 odd years later. Aside from a few shoddily obvious rear projection shots, the special effects are still realistic and credible, and much of the f/x makeup and prosthetic work remain seamless. Yet, as impressive as the film's technical merits may be, it is the sensitive and surprisingly effective storyline that has propelled this film to the status of modern classic.A creative blend of time-travel science fiction, heart-pounding action, and organic, non-cloying romance, THE TERMINATOR manages to hit all of the right notes without ever condescending to the obvious nor feeling constrained and stilted. Playing the title role elevated Austrian actor/bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger into Hollywood's A-list virtually overnight, and the monosyllabic, impossibly built cyborg is still probably the best use of Schwarzenegger's steely screen presence. Linda Hamilton is likable and sympathetic as Schwarzenegger's intended victim, and Michael Biehn is terrific as a weary professional soldier. Although I also liked the high-octane, effects-heavy, multi-million dollar sequel, the comparatively low tech original remains a creative and highly influential watershed moment for the genre.",The Terminator

The only problem I have with it is that in recent years, there's been a trend in remastering the soundtracks. I can't tell you how much this annoys me! It ruins the entire feel of the movie. If a movie was made in the 80's, it should not be redubbed. It should be true to its proper place. Just imagine if ""It's a wonderful life"" had been remastered!! ""What a weird movie that is,"" everyone would say. Arnold's brand of acting, however, was the main let-down in the movie. For a person who said he tried to ""become the machine,"" he had some moments where he let his guard down, both in this installment and in T2. For example, when he is repairing the battle damage, he brushes his hair briefly, and you can see a minor smirk on his face. Can't hide the humanity. Arnold can't really act much without his subtle cockiness and muscle-confidence. As he aged, he started starring in worse and worse movies like ""Collateral Damage."" He is now just a sad, limp, old Austrian Wurst, unfortunately for him. The art department was the major let-down in this one, which was far superior in T2. You can tell that some of the vehicles and other things are almost like cardboard cut-outs or something.

A nice start for James Cameron's career. And Arnold Swartzenegger career for that sake, although he had made two movies prior to this, but this kinda put him on the ""map"". Also it's cool to see him as the bad guy, and not the invincible hero. i know it's a bit ironic as he is an almost invincible cyborg here, but it fits better for a foe rather than a friend. hero's need to struggle, while the enemy seem almost impossible to kill. It builds up tension, and this movie is packed with it.I don't think I neither need or should tell the plot. it's about a robot trying to prevent a person to be born, so he goes back in time to kill his mother. That's about it, unless you want details, but then I advise you to see the movie instead.The effects are great, especially considering it's budget; US$6.5 million. Not much for Hollywood standards, and it hardly shows. Even though some times the robot is a stop-motion effects, and the terminators's eye looks a little fake, it's nothing you really should bother to point out. It's from 1984, has a small budget, and it's about a cyborg killer, I'm impressed by what James Cameron achieved in this film.I really look forward to see Terminator 2, and sadly I saw the third one first.

330,Minus_The_Beer,Terminator? Darn Near Killed Her!,10,4 November 2012,"Lean, mean and efficient. Like its title-character, so is James Cameron's breakthrough film, ""The Terminator."" Securing its status as a sci-fi classic almost immediately upon impact, it made a star out of a certain Austrian bodybuilder, introduced Hollywood to one of the finest blockbuster directors of our time and forever changed the landscape of both the science fiction and action genres.The film opens with a muscle-bound machine -- or a ""Terminator"" as they are more commonly known -- (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arriving in Los Angeles, strictly for business purposes. It seems he has been sent back in time after his creators -- the man-made machines that have taken over and enslaved civilization -- have exhausted all their resources in trying to squash a pesky pest in resistance leader John Connor. His mission: destroy Connor's mother, (Linda Hamilton) before he has even been conceptualized, thus ensuring victory for all machine kind. Soon enough the bad bot finds a thorn in his side, as the resistance has found a way to send one of their own, a solider by the name of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), back in time to preserve the future fruit of Miss Connor's loins.What is often forgotten about the film amidst its cultural impact is just how tightly-paced and well oiled it really is. There truly isn't a moment of fat to be found here. Keeping things under the two hour mark, Cameron crams just as much action as he does character into the film. Sure, there are action scenes galore and you can bet it'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Crucial to the film's success though are moments where the film breathes, letting in moments of social commentary and humor like fresh air at all the right moments. To be sure, the Terminator's pursuit of Kyle and Sarah is made all the more intense because you believe in them and are placed amidst the chaos via your own investment in the characters.While Schwarzenegger is absolutely unforgettable as the unstoppable killing machine, the film is certainly helped a great deal by Biehn's intensity and commitment to material that may have sounded ridiculous on paper. Hamilton plays it straight as the girl-next-door type caught in the crossfire. Shame her career never really extended beyond this film and its sequel, as she really embodies a character you want to root for. Of course, none of this would even matter if not for Cameron's knack for white-knuckled action and tension. Almost like John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" with a robot, the film is stripped down and singularly focused. As Reese states early on, The Terminator will not stop until Sarah is dead. Keeping true to such a theme, the film is intense from front to back.While there are certainly things that date the film -- some rough effects by today's standards, Linda Hamilton looking a bit like Joe Dirt -- it has held up remarkably well over the years. At close to 30 years of age, there are few films that have come along in its wake that can even compare. Even if you've seen it a hundred times, it still entertains like few films of its ilk can. Truly a bonafide classic, ""The Terminator"" stands in a class by its own. Be sure to look out for the equally awesome sequel, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" but beware of the diminishing returns brought on by two later sequels and a well-meaning but utterly unnecessary TV series.",The Terminator

With a dynamic, fluid, pop style (wonderful electronic soundtrack), and atmosphere of anxiety due to the darkness, Cameron manages to create the most terrible menace for men about technology: a Terminator, a machine come from the future to destroy humans. And the machine can't be dropped: the difference from humans is properly in its incapacity to understand emotion and to understand limits; if it's created for destroy, if it understands just the obligation to live better (and for this also killing creators, seen as weak and imperfect), nothing can't defeat it, and the last scene, with the Termination disposed to fight until it can reveals this strange creepy strength that comes not from willing but from a mechanical rationality and program.

332,kclipper,One of the greatest action/sci-fi films of all time,10,27 July 2014,"James Cameron delivers his first box office sensation starring the ultimate body-builder legend, Arnold Schwarzenegger in this classic 1980's technical science fiction action thriller. Its one of the coolest conceptual movies ever made taking place in a modern world that may or may not exist in the near future due to artificially intelligent machines deciding to strike back against mankind. Although, younger viewers will find some of the special effects a bit cheesy and dated, the plot is a concept that will define a whole new genre, and changed Americans' perspective of films forever. Schwarzenegger is sheer perfection as a menacing futuristic cyborg sent back to the year 1984 in order to destroy the mother of an unborn resistance leader that will inevitably defeat the machines. The human resistance must counter-attack by sending a human being (Michael Biehn) back to the same year to protect the target (Linda Hamilton). This is slam-bang action from start to finish, and features an excellent cast and the innovative, ground-breaking genius of Stan Winston's blending of computer animation with mechanical prosthetic motion photography. A haunting musical score, clever script, tense mood and atmosphere contribute to the film's suspense, and a revealing climax that is the icing on the cake. Cameron's detailed vision is complex and engaging, and Hamilton, Biehn, Paul Winfield, and Lance Henrickson are all outstanding. Also features early performances by 80's up-comers Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, Dick Miller and more. This will also spawn the excellent ground-breaking sequel, T2: Judgement Day.

Back in the '70's and 80's, movies could be very low budget, but still be great(think of John Carpenter's Halloween).The Terminator is a story about how nuclear war causes the end to mankind and the end result could be the start of an even greater tragedy than the war its self. The entire message of The Terminator is an anti nuclear war message.Many people think that a few parts in the beginning of the movie are just some random things thrown in. I can understand why, but these seemingly random scenes actually do have a lot to do with the story.Arnold does a great job as the cyborg who is programmed to kill without mercy or remorse. For those who don't know, this is the movie where the line ""I'll be back"" was spoken. The other actors do a good job in this. Linda Hamilton made a great choice doing this movie and she really improved her career through it(the movie she made before this was the horrible Children Of The Corn).This is better than Terminator 2(which is still great by the way), because this movie has more of a story and is more involved.

This has only added more to my belief and I am awe of this one as well. The best bit for me in the film has to be the ending scenes where the terminator had to be killed three times, of which the best was when he shows up for the third and the last time without legs. Assured that they can't get it wrong twice I thought him to be dead, as I shouted a loud ""Oh' my God!"" when he attacks them for the third time. His death was intelligently shown as a crushing from which he could never have recovered.Personally though I had bit of a funny experience as, having watched 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991) I was influenced into thinking that here too Arnold Schwarzenegger would be the hero but scene after scene my expectations of a hero weren't being met and it was when he attacks Sarah Connor for the first time and the other guy saves her, it's that where I got things right. Hahaha!All in all, the terminator film concept itself is one the most unique and worthy of appreciation.

338,moviemattb,"A Classic Movie Of The 80s That Mixes With Action, Horror, And Science Fiction",10,19 August 2014,"""The Terminator"" is one of the most popular movies that was made back in the mid-80s, and it has been well-remembered by critics and audiences alike. Everyone has seen this movies and knows it quite well as much as its famous sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" I don't know if I had anything new to say about this movie because everyone already knows well about ""The Terminator"" and why its so darn good about it. This movie was directed by James Cameron who would go on to make the second ""Terminator"" movie along with the second ""Alien"" movie, ""The Abyss,"" ""True Lies,"" ""Titanic,"" and now ""Avatar."" I know that Cameron considered this movie to be his first film because his previous film ""Piranha II: The Spawning,"" was going to be but some random people of the movie took over and wasn't like the way the Cameron envision it. So he just ignores that movie and considers ""The Terminator"" as his first film because he had more control than he had with the second ""Piranha"" movie. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, which it was his first time to play a villain and he really does a fascinating job to not only he embodied the character, but making it such a memorable role. He is the Terminator. Michael Biehn was also great as Kyle Reese along side with Linda Hamilton as John Connor's mother Sarah. The movie really does go at a really good pace, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. The music by Brad Fiedel is one of the greatest scores that has ever been heard in this kind of movie with the use of synthesizer, and featuring the famous ""Terminator Theme."" The special effects in this movie are really good in this movie, especially with the design of the Terminator by the great Stan Winston. The effects are no ""Terminator 2,"" but they are still really good before there was any CGI as what most filmmakers are using by today's special effects. The story is really well told and very effective as the premise goes along without any subplots or any of that mumble jumble. All it is that one is really trying to protect Sarah Connor, while the other to terminate and that is all you need for a story like this. ""The Terminator"" is a classic movie of the 80s that mixes with action, horror, and science fiction. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",The Terminator
339,talllwoood13,poorly paced,3,25 September 2021,"This movie is iconic, a ton of references are made about it to this day and I love the intro song from the movie to the point I could draw with it on or something to get the right mood however this movie hasn't aged very well in my opinion. Sure this movie is close to 40 years old but these are many ways I didn't care for it.Firstly it's too long, it's poorly paced, some scenes could have been cut out entirely and not affected the movie at all to keep us from being bored and trust me there's a few of them. Though I admire James for having the credits in their own place, not just stamped over the movie while we try to focus on the story yet are curious who is in this.The action was very well done especially for the time in some regards. I love how as Reese fights against The Terminator he loses an eye and other stuff happens to that iconic last scene with him in it. The drive by shooting and everything. You can tell Jean Claude Van Damme was heavily inspired by Arnold's role in this when he did the far better ""Universal Soldier"" movie. Seriously go watch it if you haven't. It's everything this basic movie isn't.There are some great shots of LA, almost everything has this cold blue tint to it.The casting of Sarah and Kyle Reese were so terrible. It reminded me of Lisa and Mark from the movie The Room (2003), Sarah doesn't have the look and can remotely act but she's no super model which can be a good thing and Reese can't act his way out of a wet paper bag. Both of their hair styles are hideous. Reese's character isn't as believable as I'd want him to be. He doesn't have that look of an action hero or whatever we're supposed to believe he is. I can't take his voice seriously. There is an intimate scene in it which even I think Tommy Wiseau would go this isn't good. I'm not expecting stuff on a certain hub but still, 80s romance scenes are hilarious.The soundtrack consists of ""angry super nintendo"" music for the most part and it gets on your nerves how dull it is, yet sounds like that you'd expect from a movie in the future I guess because that is what mouth breathers expect in their crappy sci-fi movies.The only thing bad I can say about Arnold is when he fires any gun he blinks his eyes, yeah a robot would totally do that. He plays the role well. Though the claymation used would be laughed at today. The CGI for the terminator walking is so poorly paced. I see what virgin slayer 12 year old pro gamers talk about when they mention low frame rate now i think. Some of the CGI can look alright, again this movie was ground breaking but it should have came out a few years later.How they set this movie up for a sequel was lazy too though they did address a lot of stuff such as why they are naked when they travel though time.I honestly enjoyed going to the washroom more after finishing this dreadful movie, maybe if you were a kid in the 80s and nothing else was like this out at the time it would have been iconic but seeing it now and all the movies it inspired is like ""flooring it"" in a 1920s car to a car made today. Not even talking sports cars either.",The Terminator
340,Morbius_Fitzgerald,A true classic.,9,12 December 2012,"I have said it before - I am not one to fall in with the hype of a movie on the top 250 but Terminator has something about it, what? Partially it is the terror Schwarzenegger portrays (that he is able to survive just about anything, not talking about his acting). Partially it is the fact that in spite of its age it still remains timeless (except maybe the fashion) but mostly, its because of the entertaining script and the great execution of the plot.The plot is a rather interesting premise and yet not complicated. A soldier is sent from the future to protect a woman - who will mother the leader of the human resistance of a machine vs human war - against a machine disguised as a man sent to kill her before he is even conceived.I have to compliment how well the performances were. Linda Hamilton is a little overlooked in her role as Sarah and she does bring depth to the role as does Michael Biehn in his role as Kyle.Any complaints about this film? When the second Sarah Connor died I would think that the police would try and bring in the remaining Sarah for protection. Its a bit of a small one but am I supposed to believe that after cops find a pattern emerging in a serial killer's ploy they do nothing? Overall I recommend if you want a well written sci-fi thriller.",The Terminator
341,raphaklopper,"""I'll be back"" began here and will live forever!",10,7 September 2013,"James Cameron (writer - director) at the time was known only by the awful trash movie ""Piranha II"". Hollywood not even knew his name (today when confirms a movie it already causes controversy, like start doing years later Tarantino) and when ""Terminator"" was announced none company was very interested in producing it. And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film.""The Terminator"" was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before.Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, ""Sarah Connor"". The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called ""Terminator 101"".Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and cliché, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as ""a day like any other"", by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci – fi: time travel that had only been seen in ""Back to the Future "" with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in ""Planet of the apes"", also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone.The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in ""Titanic"".A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, ""The Terminator"" revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10",The Terminator

345,ahegde3149,Original and classic sci-fi action,9,5 January 2015,"After hearing many times to watch terminator series and seeing good reviews finally saw all the terminator movies over the weekend. Being a big fan of sci-fi genre, must say this movie establishes another incredible sci-fi universe like alien,matrix,etc. even though last 2 movies were disappointing. Even if the effects looked very dated, still its a evergreen classic which will be remembered for a long time. The dreadful and menacing 'Terminator' played stylishly by Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his career defining roles. It feels like he was destined for the role. The Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel with the clanging metal matches the character of Terminator perfectly and is one of the best themes of all time alongside likes of Star Wars. James Cameron makes skillful use of low-budget effect with a wonderful story. I admired his work in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', but now I have realized his best work dates back in the 1980s-90s with the best film being 'Aliens'. A mysterious looking man with no clothes on emerges out of nowhere in L.A. in 1984, he seems to be hunting a woman named Sarah Connor. Similarly another man also emerges who is also looking for the same woman. As it turns out this latter guy is there to protect the woman from the earlier mysterious guy who isn't actually a man but machine called 'Terminator' whose mission is to kill Sarah. Both are sent from a post-nuclear war future where man and machine are fighting, and the fate of Sarah is very important in the whole premise. Well the film kind of shows that the Discovery of Arnold's character is a Terminator a surprising moment as enough suspense gets built up. But since we are already told in the beginning that in future there man vs machine war, so I wouldn't consider it as spoiler. Also as soon as you have time-travel involved in Sci-fi movies the emergence of some paradox is imminent unless you draw line or stick with assumptions. The whole franchise is affected by it, but I feel its the least in The Terminator.Keeping aside the time-travel the movie's spotlight is its horrific and suspenseful pursuit of Sarah by Terminator. Machines have no feelings like emotion or fear, thus the ruthless Terminator has become like a horror icon! Also there are scenes of the future earth where the nuclear war destruction and the terror of the machine ravaging the lives of humans.These make of think of the path the human race is headed. Brad Fiedel score makes the atmosphere even more scary. Here we have another blend scifi-horror like the 'Alien' and 'The Thing' only with more action. But what makes Terminator a classic on its own is its characters and story. Both Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were excellent. Without any doubt Arnold was bad- ass and the best. Also I got to enjoy the famous dialogues like 'I'll be Back' or 'Come with me if you want to live' which have become so iconic that all the terminator sequels use them so as to entertain the fans of this original film. The pacing is slightly slow but suspense keeps you engaged. Overall if you think of time it was released, it is a classic and breakthrough film in its genre. Despite not having great effects and me watching it at a time where sci-fi movies aren't that rare 'The Terminator' entertains a lot. It is because it has great story and splendid characters and acting. The thing many special-effect driven sci-fi movies miss nowadays. RATING: [4.5/5]",The Terminator

This spawned a great sequel and atrocious sequels/remakes like Salvation, Genesis and Dark Fate, which is unfortunate because it disrespects the first film which is a love story and it includes some great acting and a sense of 80s camp you can't get elsewhere.

The film is still excellent. It is a clever, thought provoking, suspense action thriller. It is a Science Fiction fans dream. No sugar coating, not too many touching moments, just a bad ass cyborg trying to find and kill a woman.

349,NikkoFranco,"Futuristic, Suspenseful, Pacesetter",9,27 May 2018,"When you are barely seventeen and see this for the first time in an era without much tech as now, this film sealed my deal in being a lifelong Schwarzenegger fan. When a story is so original, you do not understand entirely what is going on, you can not blink and left in awe trying to grasp what this machine man robot means . The 80s is captured for eternal here, the big hairs, seedy discotheques, synthesizer and more. As this film is going at such fast rate throughout, one was wondering why the need to kill all Sarah Connor, thus only when Michael Biehn , savior of Sarah played by the unassuming Linda Hamilton came into play was it clearer. The effects , those days standards, were so good, a lot of people were screaming at the theatre thinking that the Terminator gets out of the screen onto us. Arnold Schwarzenegger is convincing and I can not imagine what happened if Dolph Lundgren got the role instead as it was rumored that he was offered the role as well. From the T1000 franchise, this is the story and special effects pacesetter of many action films to come.",The Terminator
350,MovieLuvaMatt,"No classic, but entertaining",7,17 October 2003,"Personally, I enjoyed the sequels better and the film is somewhat dated (especially with the electronic soundtrack), but I still liked this movie. I just don't visualize myself watching it on many repeat viewings.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's robotic acting is perfect for the role of the terminator. On the other hand, Michael Biehn has no excuse.  His performance is completely dull, and I wish James Cameron put more thought into casting the hero.  You do want the hero to have SOME inkling of a personality.  Linda Hamilton's performance, though rusty at points, is pretty good.  It's also nice to see Paul Winfield, who I think I haven't seen since ""Cliffhanger."" Lance Henriksen is always cool to watch.  The storyline is thin and easy-to-follow.  It's nice to hear the premiere of Arnie's ""I'll be back"" line.  The film didn't send me leaping from my seat, but it's worth a look. Seeing that it has reached pretty high status on the IMDB, I'm sure others have a much higher opinion of the original ""Terminator.""My score:  7 (out of 10)",The Terminator
351,thewillt08,The 80s at its Finest,8,11 July 2013,"I didn't know James Cameron wrote and directed The Terminator, can't say that I'm surprised because only a genius could have created it. The Terminator is early on in Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron's careers' and this movie put them on the map, or at least made them bigger stars. James Cameron created a world of time travel and the inevitable end of the world with a war between humanity and machines. What could possibly go wrong? The answer is nothing.Arnold plays the terminator, a emotionless, flat, cyborg, killing machine that has one goal, terminate. Arnold was a perfect role. He obviously has his accent and amazing physique and he probably has fifty lines in the movie and he is intimidating. The special effects done to his face when he is part human and part machine is done really well. The only flaw in the effects is the shots when the actual machine is walking on a green screen. In all honesty it looked awful and took me out of the experience but for its time it was acceptable. The character terminator itself was scary and godlike to say the least and the only reason this movie wasn't a ridiculous robot going on a killing rampage was the story behind it. In the year 2029, or something close to it, a man named John Connor is the leader of the human revolution and he gets word of a terminator going back in time to kill Sarah Connor, John's mother, to prevent John from being born. OK, so let's start with the idea of time travel. Brilliant, I love it. It makes me think and wonder what happens next. I could go on a rant and rave about time travel and how it messes on my mind but that's for another day. John Connor has a counter and sends one of his best men, Kyle Reece, to the past to protect Sarah Connor. Throughout the movie Reece gives bits and pieces as to what happens in the future and how the machines take over humanity. The bits and pieces were awesome, it didn't overwhelm me with information and it kept me invested in the story. The back story is incredible and the universe James Cameron created is commendable. The only real downside to the story is the lack of characters. Reece is a good character but I wasn't a huge fan. His acting was a little flat and I wasn't fully invested n his character. There was something about him that rubbed me the wrong way. The action in the move was really cool. The Terminator is basically invincible so seeing Arnold get shot rapidity and watching him throw people through windows was awesome. The car chases were done well and the best scene was easily when the terminator tears through the police station and says the famous line, ""I'll be back."" Nobody realized it then but that quote is imitated by everybody at least once in their life, even if they haven't seen the movie. Arnold's voice and the way he acts on screen is so unusual but effective. This thing clearly isn't human and Arnold does it perfectly. People may disagree with me on this but I'm saying it now, Arnold as the first Terminator is better than the T-1000. I really liked the character Sarah Connor. She is the most important character and she is portrayed really well. She is a normal girl with a normal life just trying to get by. She is a waitress and a lot of people can relate to that. As 'm writing this now I am a waiter so I know. Sarah Connor is a character people sympathize with so nice work, Cameron; you know how to write a main character. The relationship between Reece and Sarah is cute to say the least. The way their relationship builds is very believable. If you have seen enough movies you can figure out the end of the movie and what happens to each character but when I first saw it I had no idea what was going to happen. Looking back I should have figured it out but that's the magic of movies. Overall, The Terminator is a classic in my opinion. I loved the movie and the depth behind the story. Arnold was born to play this role and James Cameron was born to make brilliant movies. The two of them together is a powerhouse that couldn't possibly fail. The Terminator without a doubt gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",The Terminator
352,miken-3,Possible the Best Action/Sci Flick of all time!,10,27 January 2005,"I remember going to this movie thinking it would put me to sleep. After all, back then Arnold was just a muscle guy who had made Pumping Iron and then the not too good, Conan the Barbarian. Boy was I wrong! This movie hooked me from the opening scene and even Arnold's stiff sounding dialogue was perfect for the cyborg he was playing! The chase scenes and narrow escapes had my heart pounding throughout the film! There were many scenes in this film that were firsts for movies such as Arnold removing a damaged robotic eyeball, seeing how the robot mind decided on what dialogue to say and having a robot disguise their voice to sound exactly like a dead human! The other Terminator films may have had the computer enhanced special effects, but they could not match the storyline of this action/SciFi classic that is probably the best all time of its genre!",The Terminator
353,leftistcritic,White masculinity and a shoot 'em up,1,24 January 2019,"Like the second movie, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, this one also has little value. Some may revere it culturally but they are clearly mistaken. It is a violent movie which showcases murder and White masculinity. I would never recommend this piece of trash to anyone.There's much more than this short paragraph to describe this film, however. This science fiction film, directed by James Cameron, has become a classic despite what I have previously stated. The horrid violence of this film is not the worst part, but rather than even the time travel to the past is not very interesting either. Other movies have much better forms of time travel than this film. You could say that film is, like the New York Times said when it was first released, ""B-movie with flair,"" or like the Pittsburgh Press and say it has ""artsy ugliness."" Both of those views have validity. I would add that this film pushed Arnold Schwarzenegger further to stardom and is one of the films is is most known for, not surprisingly.Otherwise, I don't think it is worth reviewing this film any further as I'd rather review more worthwhile films, with this film definitely deserving a rating of 1 out of 10, one of the lowest ratings I have ever given a movie.",The Terminator
354,Marx_Bros_Fan86,A Classic,9,23 January 2006,"The Terminator is the quintessential action film and the best of the series. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the Terminator, a cyborg from the future who is sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), because she will eventually give birth to John Connor, the man who will become the leader of the human resistance in the war against the machines. The soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent back to protect her. T1 has a dark and gritty atmosphere that the second and third films do not have, which can be partially attributed to the fact that most of the movie takes place at night. IMO, the film's strongest quality is Arnold's terrifying presence; whenever he is on screen, there is a feeling of impending doom. This aura of dread makes it feel like Sarah and Kyle's chances of survival are about a million to one. My heart just goes out to them whenever I watch it. Another one of The Terminator's strongest qualities is the fact that it is paced perfectly. Just like every action film, there are breaks in between the action scenes, which presents the danger that the movie will drag. But Cameron times these scenes perfectly so that it never feels like the movie is dragging. All of the action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat rooting for the good guys. The excitement never lets up! Cheesy love stories are usually a weakness in action films; fortunately, The Terminator's love story is actually very touching. I have to praise the special effects. Sure they aren't impressive by today's standards, but when you consider the fact that this movie was made on a six million dollar budget, it is amazing they turned out so well. Stan Winston is truly a genius. As for the sound, I recommend the original mono track as opposed to the new sound on the DVD. IMO, the guns sound muted with the DVD's sound FX. Of course this isn't a perfect movie. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are not exactly the best actors in the world, but to Hamilton's credit she improved in T2. But this is only a minor criticism. The Terminator is a must-see for every action fan.",The Terminator

The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films.

360,eamon-hennedy,What the 1980's were all about.,9,23 May 2003,"This is a genuinely great film in every regards. James Cameron has crafted a film that works on so many emotional and story telling levels, it was an early sign of what a great talent he was going to be in future years (even if the budgets were to get out of control). To start of The Termintator works as a great science fiction/time travel story, but transends that and goes of into other fantastic realms as Cameron takes the film and turns it into a great gothic love story, a nightmarish thriller and a story of irony and love. It is a classic film and one that defines the 80's. Where he suceeds most is with his story. Cameron's abilities as a story teller is what makes him one of the best directors working today and the story of Sarah Connor and the battle to either save or end her life is compulsive film and is dealt with with great assurance from Cameron as he takes full control of the screenplay and the direction, squeezing every emotion and inch of suspense for all it is worth.It is no surprise to see that Arnie went on to bigger and better things after this film. His performance in this film is that of sheer menace. The lack of emotion and that cold, icy face makes the character an icon, even if he is such an evil person (thing). While saying half a dozen lines, looking evil and firing lots of guns isn't what you would call a great performance, Arnie turns it into an art form and showed everybody in 1984 that this guy could just be the next best thing.If Arnie (sorry for calling him that, I can't spell his surname) is the evil centre of the story, then Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are the emotional centre, the love story that develops between them heartbreaking at the end, but one which throughout the film gives us a sense of optimism. Their performances are fantastic, especially Hamilton, and the development of their characters is spot on.It is no surprise that Cameron went on to bigger and better things after this, but the film is still a monumental one and one that is often associated with him, even if it is a low budget thriller. While the sequel would go on to be better (in my opinion), it is the sheer horror and viciousness of this film as well as the performance of Arnie that will always make us remember this one even more.",The Terminator
361,nhlgumby,The Terminator,9,17 May 2006,"James Cameron makes his science fiction masterpiece about time travel, cyborgs, guns, chicks, and Arnold. Hot damn this was an awesome movie! I had never seen this before so I watched this with extreme scrutiny considering the heaps of praise everyone lavishes upon this movie, and I have to say nearly every bit of it holds up like a rock. Cameron tackles the subject of the past affecting the future through time travel without skipping a beat and barrels his movie down a slip and slide of action. Action splashed here, splashed there, action freaking everywhere. The stop motion was great as was the dark, almost black post-apocalyptic world of the future. We see tank machines rolling over dozens of skulls and bones, lasers, guns, battle armor, flying machines, this movie was so much fun. About the only problems I had with the movie were the Highlander-esquire special lightning effects at the beginning of the movie. If I were going to update anything, it would have to be the way the lighting licked the metal pipes while the bum in the alleyway looked on unfazed at the storm of blue electricity. Either it was the bum's lack of reaction that I didn't like or it was the actual special effect. It's hard to decide. Anyways, another classic film from the science fiction genre down thanks to the University library.",The Terminator
362,Ben-Hibburd,The Terminator Review,10,19 December 2017,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that The Terminator is one of my favourite films of all-time. And a film i consider to be a near faultless action/horror masterpiece!I think by now pop culture and anyone who considers themselves a film buff knows what this story is about. So i'm not going to go into a long winded jaunt into the finer plot elements as they've been done to death already. However I wanted too highlight one area of the film that I don't think gets enough credit. And that would be the phenomenal pacing and editing. In my opinion The Terminator has the best pacing in a film that I've seen, and perhaps one of the best of all-time.The film starts with a small amount of exposition which is needed. But as soon as the film shifts to the present day the film moves at a thunderous pace and never slows down. Even in the quieter character building scenes the plot is constantly being propelled towards the films endgame.From the assault on the Police precinct onward the film maintains a constant fluidity of pure action intertwined with deep character motivations. There's not a single dull frame in this film, even after my thirtieth odd watch i'm constantly engaged and sucked into the film, and a-lot of this down to brilliant editing.The action scenes are also expertly shot and choreographed. The transitions from one set piece to other flow smoothly, never feeling out of place. It's a truly remarkable achievement James Cameron was able to accomplish on such a small budget.With exception to Mad Max: The Road Warrior I can't think of another action film that's paced to perfection. There are very few films that are able to balance action, character development and world building with as much depth as The Terminator. Editor Mark Goldblatt deserves just as much credit as Cameron got for crafting a flawless action masterpiece.",The Terminator
363,Pyro_Pizza,Dark and Gritty 80s,8,12 May 2021,"The Terminator turns the bright lights of the 80s to a dark and gritty thriller. The story while simple is unique and fun. The acting is good, using Arnold as an emotionless machine creatively uses his less than superb acting in a brilliant way. It's intense, it's dark it's awesome. However at times the pacing can be slow bring the movie to a grinding halt, and some of the special effects have no aged well. Despite this it's a must see movie for any sci-fi fan.",The Terminator
364,jofitz27,"A brutal, yet flawed classic",9,20 May 2005,"In 1984, little known director James Cameron picked up little known body building muscle man Arnold Schwarzenegger for a sci fi action movie 'The Terminator'. In short, both do very good jobs: Cameron, with his excellent provision of special effects and action sequences, and Arnold, expertly playing the terminator: an emotionless killing machine.For the time, and even now, this film is nearly startlingly brutal. Less slow than 'Alien' and more in your face, this is a no-holds, dark piece of work, as this piece of human metal performs hideous operations and cold bloodily (yes, the Terminator has blood) kills innocent (or not so innocent) beings.This film was a landmark for it's time, a lot to do with the special effects. Maybe less so impressive today, but the action sequences are frequent, and frequently impressive. This is tense, exciting stuff, from the word go. We care for our characters, but in a strange way, this Terminator has likable qualities: it manages to be so insensitive, yet so undeniably unstoppably cool.Where this film faults is general errors. They may be little, and not hold back the entertainment value, but do stick out like a knife in the back. (Note: James Cameron directed 'The Titanic', check this website for goofs!) For instance, the tension is unintentionally held back in one scene where our heroin desperately shoves a quarter into a phone box and dials 911. Since when is money needed for emergency calls?Still, this is brutal and effective: a classic, and still today, it remains and very solid, if faulted, movie.***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)",The Terminator
365,rowanmaillot,The greatest James Cameron film? No..,10,2 June 2020,"..But still a goddamn great film! Even though the sequel is ever-so-slightly better, I appreciate this film so much because it was the movie that made me love movies that's why it will always have a special place in my heart. The Terminator is directed by James Cameron (one of my favourite directors after Kubrick, Nolan and Ridley Scott) and in my opinion it is less of a science fiction film and more of a horror film!Just like Alien and Aliens, the first movie is a low budget horror masterpiece and the second one is a straight-up action, sci-fi blockbuster! Same goes for Terminator and Judgement Day. This film picks up in a trashy environment where robots are brought to the world either to start chaos or end chaos, with Arnold Schwarzenegger he is brought to the world to cause chaos and Michael Biehn's character is brought to the world to stop the chaos. They are both in robot form, one is immortal, can't feel pain and can't die, whereas with the Biehn character, he can feel pain and can die.We see Schwarzenegger's T-800 walk towards a group of what appear to be junkies, he asks for clothes to wear because when robots are brought to the real world they are naked and have no clothes to wear. Terminator starts to get a little bit pissed off because they start belittling him and making fun of him, he grabs one of them by the throat and chokes him with his bare hands! He gets the second guy and rips his heart out, which- ouch! The last guy surrenders and gives him his clothes, right off the bat this is one of the best introductions to a character (or a robot in this case) in cinematic history!The good guy, Kyle Reese, does the same thing but he doesn't kill, the guy ends up not giving Reese his clothes so he runs into a closed clothes store and takes (or perhaps, steals) clothes from there and runs off. If you have not seen The Terminator, what are you doing with your life? I mean, seriously! It is one of the greatest films of all time and I think 90% of the viewers could agree on that! It's a must-see and a great horror/action thrill ride for movie-goers and cinema lovers.",The Terminator
366,ingemar-4,Icon SF action thriller,10,22 September 2009,"This is one of the great classics in the SF action genre (along with Alien), and a terrific example that budget and quality are remarkably unrelated. The big breakthroughs are made on tights budgets. It has a truly original concept, really well performed. I can't find any big holes in the plot like too many movies have. I can't even find small ones. Well, except for the time travel paradox of course.The whole story is tight, extremely well planned and executed. There doesn't seem to be a single second that isn't well timed. Of course, the actors help - not a single bad performance. Not only are Hamilton and Biehn doing their parts nicely, and stone faced Arnold of course, but all the side roles are just as fine. Cameron seems to have been doing the best directing of his life.25 years after its release, only some animations in the end feel dated (and to be frank, they were pretty bad even back then, certainly a budget problem). Today, the animations would be smoother. Let's accept that as it is. All the rest is 100%, as close to perfect that an action movie can get.It also stands as an example that action doesn't come from numbers of bad guys. One is much better than hundreds.What is there not to like? Again, some crude animations. And if you just don't want action you want to watch something else, certainly. There is blood, gore and violence. And if you don't like nudity there is a scene or two to skip. and you have to accept that time travel works despite that it doesn't. If you want Arnold as a hero and speaking more, this is not for you. But I don't say that as criticism to the movie, only stating what should keep some from it.",The Terminator

368,nmholland,A Must-See Film With One of The Most Iconic Characters of All Time,9,26 February 2016,"The Terminator is directed by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the title character. In the future, 2029, to be exact, a nuclear war has passed. Any remaining humans are struggling to survive against the machines, endoskeletons that are near indestructible. The leader of the resistance is named John Connor. When the machines figure this out, they send one of their own (played by Arnie) back in time to 1984 (of course) to find and ""terminate"" John's mother, Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton. John realizes this, and sends his best soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back to '84 to protect his mother form the invincible machine. Kind of a confusing plot.Now, as most of anybody knows, James Cameron is one of the best directors today. He's done amazing films, such as Aliens (1986), Titanic (1997), and Avatar (2009). However great those movies are, The Terminator franchise is his best idea, much like Spielberg and Jurassic Park (1993). Although Judgement Day may be slightly better, the original is still a great film, with awesome action and break- through special effects, that still hold up.Being James Cameron, the movie looks great. His shots captivate all of the car chases, shoot outs, and explosions beautifully. The cinematography, done by Adam Greenberg, makes the film look fantastic. The acting is also truly amazing. This film was Arnie's first big role, followed closely by Commando (1985). He definitely deserves the great reputation he has today, thanks to this considerable role. Linda Hamilton also does very good, and portrays the character arc from a helpless girl to a very powerful woman that doesn't need a man next to her 24/7, unlike nowadays female characters in cinema. Alongside Hamilton, Michael Biehn also does substantial, despite the difficulty of his role.The next thing I have to mention is the dialogue. The dialogue in this film is so good. There's tons of memorable quotes extracted from this movie, including ""come with me if you want to live,"" and ""I'll be back."" The lines between Sarah and Kyle is great. Their friendship is somewhat rushed, yet it doesn't feel as though it is. It feels as if we missed a point in which they got to know each other better.Although it may sound as though this film is flawless, but it's not. However, it was very hard to recognize said flaws within the movie. But, I did find one. And a quite big one. It's going to be a bit difficult to explain this issue without giving away a major plot point, but it's possible. Now, having to deal with a subject as time travel, any movie is going to have an unexplained or impossible paradox. This one has to do with the existence of John Connor, prior to the events in this film. That's all I'm going to say. However small this drawback may seem, it prevents the movie from being perfect.Overall, The Terminator is an astounding film, and anybody and everybody should see it sometime in their life. Just don't watch any of the sequels, besides Judgement Day. I'm going to give The Terminator an A, or a 9 out of 10.",The Terminator

Arnie of course plays the almost unstoppable cyborg, who has a mission that is simply to kill the mother of the man who has caused humans to fight back against the cyborgs in the future. Linda Hamilton is the ""Mother of the Future"" who is being stalked by Mr. Terminator, but she gets help from a soldier sent back from the future by her son, Kyle Reese played by Michael Biehn.

Its packed with solid action, a good plot, and good direction. The only thing was the special FX, but considering the film's budget and that it was 1984, they are not bad. But comparing them to today's they are kind of weak.  But besides that, this is one hell of an action film.  Arnie's does'nt say much but he does a good as the title character.  I also thought Michael Beihn gave a good performance as the rebel soldier sent back to protect Linda Hamilton.  The action scene's were also solid, especially the car chases and the shootout at the police station.

Look for Lance Henrickson, Paul Winfield and even Bill Paxton in an early role as punk #1.It's a sci fi classic now, and it set the bar the countless movies that came after it. If you line this movie up with Halloween, The Warriors, The Thing, Alien and a few others from the late '70s to the mid '80s, you have what amounts to a latter day golden age of science fiction/action/horror films.If you're a fan, you've seen this movie countless times.

The computer begins to ""think"" for itself and sees the human race as a threat, and decides to attempt to wipe it out by starting a worldwide nuclear war, killing most of the world's population. The survivors are left to fight the machines and attempt to regain control. They are lead by a powerful man named John Connor who teaches them to fight back against the machines whilst on the brink of extinction. The humans almost succeed in exterminating the machines that have kept them slaves for decades, but as a result SkyNet sends a cybernetic organism called a terminator back in time to kill John Connor's mother before he is even born, thus removing the threat of him altogether. John Connor decides this cannot happen and decides to send back a soldier to the past to protect his mother, and himself, from the terminator. The fight for the future will be fought in the past. Man vs. machine. Sorry for that, like it was needed.Very possibly the best action film of all time, with the exception of it's sequel, and executed with a bunch of no name actors and a shoestring budget...not to mention a director with almost no experience, it's an amazing feat to say the least. It's been 20 years since it's release, and while some special effects have aged inevitably, the effect of the movie itself has not. Linda Hamilton, Arnold (I'm not even going to try and spell that last name), and especially, the cult following worthy Michael Biehn for his characters alone, all give good performances. The film has a few very minor flaws, but is not reflective onto the enjoyment or quality factor. The action and the story are all paced nicely, has excellent direction, the characters have are well developed, and the overall content is quite impressive. The movie is fairly simple, but is extremely effective. Terminator has been deemed a classic and respectfully so. I'm sure it will provide a great movie experience for myself and others for many years to come. The idea of a machine sent to kill you that is all but unstoppable, without any remorse or hesitation, is very chilling and is one of the film's main reasons for such success. I don't need to say any more, you've seen it. Needless to say, this film started many careers of those involved. Classic.An absolute must for any action or sci-fi fan's collection.",The Terminator
374,charlessmith702210,Good movie but still could be better,7,3 February 2007,"The allusion to Terminator 2 happened in Terminator 1. In Terminator 1 there is the Terminator killing over 15 police officers.Little did I realize that all of this killing was a diversion for the Terminator's main mission...to put to death Sarah Connor.The big climax of course was the big piece of what this movie was all about. The chase scene between the young soldier and Sarah Connor and the stalking Terminator.And that young soldier who threw nitroglycerin bombs at the Terminator during the chase scene was vulnerable. Every time the bombs blew up, the Terminator found a way to evade them.Well, the young soldier wins a partial victory against the Terminator's stalking of Sarah Connor, putting one nitro bomb on the Terminator's body. The Terminator blows up when the bomb detonates but the young soldier, sadly, immediately dies from blunt force trauma from the Terminator's roundhouse punch to the soldier's head before the soldier planted the bomb into the Terminator.The blast leaves the Terminator only in a bare endoskeleton with only his face, arms and torso intact (the legs were completely gone), and you think he's gone? No. He comes back meaner and treacherous than ever, as he entraps Sarah Connor. But Sarah Connor knows what to do. The Terminator doesn't know about a crushing hydraulic press...only about killing Sarah. The Terminator's hand extends to Sarah's neck, but Sarah escapes eventual doom by pressing the red button to set off the hydraulic press.

375,starlit-sky,One of the Greatest Modern Science Fiction Movies,10,20 January 2011,"It's not easy to write a review about a movie I have seen 27 years ago. This movie is quarter-century old. It's a great combination of action, science-fiction, mystery and romance. Fundementally, it is based upon a futuristic science fiction idea.The present time story begins with two guys appearing out of of thin air, searching for Sarah O'Connor. One of them is a tough guy, full of muscles, who seems to kill anybody on his way without any hesitation or remorse. The other is a mild character with somewhat more delicate features.As the story unfolds, you realize each character has his own agenda about Sarah O'Connor. One of them is protective of Sarah while the other is trying to terminate her - hence The Terminator.Why The Terminator is trying to kill Sarah is the mystery of the movie. It ties to the introduction in the beginning of the movie when we are given a glimpse of the future when mankind are battling with the machines for their survival.Overall, Terminator is a great motion picture, a combination of familiar sci-fi elements put together in an original script packed with entertaining action sequences. Arnold is perfect for this role. Its almost as if the role has been written for him. Its success has been confirmed by later sequels (T2 Judgment Day, Terminator 3 The Rise of the Machines, and Terminator Salvation).",The Terminator
376,stephenlovelette,As good as movies get.,10,30 June 2014,"Raise your hand if you've seen The Terminator.Okay.So, people of Earth, how many of you recall the last time you caught Arnold's breakout performance?Who were you with? Were you conveyed by carriage or dirigible?Put your hand down if you can't remember.I only ask because revisiting's worthwhile.This was my first time watching the movie, so my Dad and I instant-streamed T1 via Netflix. And it's glorious, lemme tell ya.Soon as Arnold starts killing innocent people, my Dad says, ""I don't remember him being the bad guy.""We realize he's never seen the first installment before. He only thinks he remembers. And I bet that's the case for many folks not raising their hand.It's been thirty years since release, but it holds up like you wouldn't believe.Seriously. The Terminator's a smart movie.Every character is watertight. Prominent or minor the acting's often what retains the captivation in between gunplay and chase scenes.The cops are Traxler and Vukovich, played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen (a.k.a. Bishop from Aliens), and have a humorous dynamic. Sarah's roommate, Bess Motta as Ginger, is the sexy bouncy type, and her boyfriend's a well-meaning dummy. Kyle Reese (played by Michael Biehn) is withdrawn and serious.How about Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor? She's such an ass-kicking delight, her likeness is still utilized twenty-four years later in Fox's Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The show ran for two seasons and stars the pinnacle of underrated actresses, Lena Headey.Talk about a crowning accolade for Hamilton's performance.As a standalone, the story is very good and there's almost no need for a sequel. Although the ending lends itself to continuation, it's not necessary.The movie's greatest weakness is the same mistake made by other science fiction films like Escape from New York and Event Horizon; meaning a drastic underestimation in regards to the timeframe. The scenes that take place in the future are supposed to be set in 2029. I don't think laser ammunition, synthetic skin cells and advanced artificial intelligence are around the corner.Oh. And there's time travel.But this is a silly topic of discussion, because the plot's 'self-contained'; the rules allotted to the story's universe are adequate enough. An artificial intelligence develops in 1997 that learns at an exponential rate, making allowances for the suspension of disbelief.The irony is, the film unfolds a lot like a horror movie.For now, all I'll say is that The Terminator is a classic must-see film in the same manner The Great Gatsby's a must-read novel.Those without a hand in the air should stop reading here, because the rest of the review will contain spoiler-heavy analysis.Nuance abounds in this movie, and it's illustrative of the intelligence packed into every detail. Much of what occurs resonates thematically with the overall narrative.For example, the recording on the girls' answering machine states, ""machines need love to,"" which obviously foreshadows Sarah's eventual encounter with the Terminator. It's also ironically commenting on the relationship between man and machine, and the eventual fate of humanity.Another detail akin to this is the name of the club where the Terminator finally locates Sarah. The name is Tech-Noir; which is a touch of self-referential humor. The filmmaking resonates with noir themes, and the subject matter's heavily rooted in science fiction.It's self-contained because of the limits established by the timeframe. In 1984, a Terminator would indeed have to look through the phone book for every 'Sarah Connor' and kill them off to ensure its mission's accomplished. It also establishes conceivable distance between the protagonist and the pursuing threat.The audience can accept humanity's resistance to obliteration against seemingly insurmountable odds when considering ideas like utilizing dogs to detect terminators.As for the special effects, most hold up quite nicely. And there shouldn't be any problem for a sophisticated viewer, given the context in which it's made. There is obvious use of green screen on set, and some devolved CGI, but for the most part everything's on the up-and-up.Okay, let's dive in.Timeline A is the history Reese returns from, which includes all events up until 2029. Timeline B is the realm in which the film unfolds, Earth in 1984.Presumably, the John Connor of Timeline A didn't descend from Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor, right? A terminator didn't arrive in Timeframe A's 1984 to attempt the same assassination?I'm assuming Timeframe A becomes separate from reality and Timeframe B will continue to unfold into an altered future.There appears to be no residual effects from the changing of history yet. No chaos or collapse; which is nice.I wonder if the sequel will cover the issue of reconnecting the loop; specifically, when history B reaches 2029, even if there's no such thing as terminators, will Reese have to travel back in time to impregnate Sarah again?Anyway, the reason I say it unfolds like a horror movie is the impending doom that's constant throughout. Sarah encounters terrifying scrapes with death around every turn. Consider the odds constantly stacked against her.After escaping the police station and literally everyone dies, Reese blasts the membrane off the Terminator's metal skeleton and dies to blow its legs off.Yet its torso continues to crawl after Sarah and is only crushed by the pneumatic press as his fingers claw at her face.The protagonist's terror is stretched to the utter limit, time and time again.For those of you still holding an arm in the air, feel free to lower it now.If nothing else you burnt some calories today, and learned two things about yourself.1. You're easily manipulated. And 2. You have exquisite taste in movie reviews.",The Terminator

The titular Terminator is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger who has minimal dialogs in this movie but is able to portray the ruthless demeanor of the emotionless cyborg perfectly.

Michael Biehn's role as Kyle Reese a soldier sent from the future to protect an important person showed determination. His character had emotions ranging from courage to passion it still is a great action film about transformation and preparing to face your destiny.In the year 2029 a computer known as Skynet had waged a deadly war against humanity for years now they've created the ultimate weapon called terminators.

Wipe out his existence entirely so there will be no resistance.Her name is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She is not rich, nor a genius. ""I can't even balance my checkbook!"" she says, ""Do I look like the mother of the future?"" But she is. And she is in great danger. Reese has to protect her at all costs, but he could not bring any weapons through the time warp. Nothing dead will travel back through time. How can you stop something that is indestructible?That, my friends, is the crux of what makes this so great. Bits and pieces of information about the future of mankind are dropped in the film's first half. Eventually we can piece them together. Director James Cameron helps us out with flashbacks, as we see the horrifying battleground of 2029 through the eyes of Kyle Reese.Once the exposition is done, the story refocuses on the troubles presently facing Connor and Reese. They can only hide so long before the tenacious machine tracks them down...and kills them.The main element, besides the story, which makes the movie so effective is the way it is directed. Cameron is one of the most gifted directors in the industry, that much is certain, and one of his fortes is pacing. He also co-wrote the script, allowing him to mold the step-by-step action to his directing. The result is a tight, gripping atmosphere with air of mystery and horror mixed in. The story is sound, and builds carefully, with the audience staying involved for both the exposition and the action. There is never a dull moment.The special effects are not very good, even for that day. The visions of the future are not too slick, and most shots of the Terminator's metal structure look fake at best. Still, Cameron finds a way to give his imagery impact and depth. The musical score is percussion heavy and synthesized, but what makes it work so well is that it's tenacious, subtly embodying the personality of the title character.As for the acting...well, Cameron is a great director there, too. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the Terminator. His most haunting quality is the straight face he keeps while slaughtering anyone who stands in his way. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are wholly convincing, making us feel for their plight. The always likable Paul Winfield also gets in on the act as a police lieutenant.In the end, this is Cameron's movie to win or lose, and he uses all of skills to the fullest. Despite its shortcomings, ""The Terminator"" is a winner. Perhaps I can finally forgive Cameron for ""Titanic.""",The Terminator
383,Mike Astill,It's a classic,8,31 July 2001,"OK, it's a classic, but few would argue that it's aged well. The effects, particularly at the climax, now leave a lot to be desired, (and in hindsight, so does the acting).Still, it's the interesting (if far-fetched) plot that drives the film, and the fact that the Terminator itself is one of the greatest screen baddies ever. For the few who have never seen the film, it won't be giving the game away to say that the titular bad guy takes some finishing off, coming back from the dead time and time again in an inventive showdown in a factory. That's because this is one of those films that has inspired countless clones and homages. The inferior sequel, suffering from a crippling lack of imagination, doesn't even come close to capturing the menace of an unstoppable killing machine, even though Robert Patrick gave the T-1000 a look and feel all its own.The prospect of a third film is quite depressing. I'd prefer to see a remake of this, or a Star-Wars style update with updated fx.",The Terminator
384,KillerLord,The Movie That Created The One Really Famous Line!,10,29 September 2008,"The Terminator is truly an action and sci-fi classic, no doubt that. It has all the right elements in it. A good plot, a good cast, good action sequences and a wonderful director in the form of James Cameron. The story is about a machine that looks like a human being, a cyborg, who has been sent back in time in order to kill a certain lady named Sarah Conner. She has to be killed so that John Conner, who is her son, does not exist. His birth has to be prevented because John Conner is going to lead the human resistance against the machines. Needless to say, it is the machines that have sent back this machine to do the job. But the human resistance is well aware of this mission and plot. So, the human resistance sends a noble warrior to aid Sarah Conner. And no, this warrior is not a machine too. He is a human being but someone who comes from a time where he has seen enough of these machines to know how to possibly take care of one to some extent. And the chase is on. The Terminator hunts down Sarah and tries to do his job. And of course, there is someone who is going to prevent that from happening. Arnold has a perfect physique and the right face to play the role of the cyborg. It is not that easy to be expressionless like a cyborg and Arnold convinces us thoroughly that he indeed is a machine who just happens to look like a human being. Sarah's protector does a wonderful job as the human warrior that he is. Linda Hamilton, playing Sarah also brings about the right range of expressions to suit her role. All in all, the cast is fantastic. And add to this, the beautiful and clean direction of Cameron and the wonderful special effects, this movie becomes what it is - a great masterpiece. There are some people of course who find this movie a little dull compared to the second part of the movie i.e. Terminator 2 : Judgment Day. There is no doubt about the fact that T2 is indeed a wonderful movie but at the same time one must not forget that this movie comes out way before T2 and considering the time in which the movie was made, what has been showcased in this chapter of the Terminator story, is simply amazing.",The Terminator
385,Tyson14,A classic,10,5 July 2015,"The modern classics of science fiction have been able to infuse crowd- pleasing action scenes with truly thought-provoking and clever concepts. From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.Sarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-'80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.As the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right ""action-hero"" buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the ""tender moments"" last about three minutes in total.With one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list.",The Terminator
386,Jackblyth8,Nothing Quite Like It,10,8 February 2021,"In 1984, visual effects and CGI weren't as extensive as they are today. The advanced cinematography films matching 'The Terminator' were the likes of 'Raiders of the Lost Dark' and 'Return of the Jedi'. Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger star in the eerie thriller, begging the questions about the possibility of time-travel and how you can change the past to affect the future. The film begins in 1984, a cyborg assassin named the Terminator (Schwarzenegger) arrives from 2029 in the search for Sarah Conner. Kyle Reese also appears from the same year, sent as a human soldier to protect the Terminator's target. The Terminator murders all women named Sarah Conner, failing to find his prey. Fearful that she is being followed, Linda Hamilton's character calls the cops and hides in a night club where Kyle and shortly after the Terminator are both situated. After an outbreak of gunshot fires, Kyle escapes with Sarah as the Terminator chases them in a stolen police car. Hiding in a car park, Kyle explains to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defence network, known as Skynet and created by Cyberdyne systems, will become self-aware in the future and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John rally's the resistance troops as a leader, guiding them to victory and on the verge of destroying the defence network. Shortly before their destruction, Skynet sent the Terminator to prevent the arise of Sarah's future son. The Terminator, a cyberdyne system model 101, is an efficient killing machine killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton, and an eternal layer of living tissue that makes it appear human. Kyle and Sarah are apprehended by the police, ridiculing Kyle for his explanation. They keep Sarah in the office away from the ruthless Terminator. The famous line ""I'll be back"" is performed by Schwarzenegger shortly before driving into the station and killing many officers. Kyle escapes from his entrapment with Sarah and drive a stolen car to a motel where they obtain pipe bombs and plan their next actions. Kyle opens up about his love towards Sarah stating he fell for her ever since he saw a picture of her carried by John. Sarah reciprocated his feelings by kissing the soldier, leading to the pair having sex. The Terminator kills Sarah's mother, impressively impersonating Sarahs's mother's voice, Terminator attempts to contact her via telephone. When they realise the Terminator has located them, they escape in a pickup truck while it chases them on a motorbike. While launching numerous pipe bombs at the Terminator, Kyle is wounded by a gunfire. Furious, Sarah throws the Terminator off his motorbike but loses control of the truck which flips over. The Terminator, now bruised and badly damaged, hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah, but, Kyle slips a pipe bomb inside the tank truck's hose tube, causing a colossal explosion that burns the human flesh off from the Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them into a factory, a struggling Kyle activates the machinery to confuse the Terminator. The robot-looking assassin confronts the pair, however fails to affect them as Kyle places another pipe bomb into its abdomen, blowing it apart, killing itself and injuring Sarah in the process. The relentless machine's torso reactivates and grabs the injured Sarah, who stretches to break free and operate the hydraulic press, to crush and destroy the last parts of the cyborg. Months later, a pregnant Sarah parks up at a gas station while travelling through Mexico, recording tapes to pass on to her unborn son, John. A boy takes an instant photo of Sarah in return for some cash, she buys it - the same photograph that John will give to Kyle. A great concept on the basis that the present can change greatly with one small change to the past. Gripping and electrifying - 'The Terminator' - ends on a fitting suspense, what is next for Sarah Connor. Winning the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film, it is a quality spectacle, keeping you on edge throughout. A true classic.",The Terminator

Schwartzenegger as the Terminator is a terrifying villain who is fixed on a relentless pattern but is also volatile.Hamilton particularly gives a memorable performance.

Some of the best films I've ever seen have been directed by unproven newbies on small budgets but with big ideas. This was John Cameron's big idea and of course the whole movie production was tense and always pressed for money, but the end result was one the best ever Sci Fi movies. 20 years later and its still fun to watch. I still say ""I'll be back"" sometimes in my deepest voice when I'm leaving the office.Today I just saw it in glorious commercial-free HD from HDNet. It looked exquisite of course but I've been reading about remastering, compression and digitizing movies so I always wonder just what it is I'm seeing. Was it a digital transfer like the new Star Wars remasters? Probably not. It looked pretty good but I'm betting that Dish does some compression on HD signals, especially when they're on the Basic HD package list like HDNet is.

397,LagerLagerLagerShouting,Sarah Conner...,8,1 May 2008,"What can you say...The ultimate 80's Sci-Fi actioner, James Cameron's bleak vision of the future is filmed in a dark, noirish style that oozes substance with clever narrative devices. The narrative however, is kept pretty linear, nothing else is happening but what you are seeing happening. Character development and narrative subtexts are also kept to a minimum so we are firmly concentrated on the action and the simple task that this unstoppable killing machine is trying to achieve. This is a formula Cameron would successfully repeat and more for his spectacular sequel T2, one of the best examples of a sequel surpassing its predecessor in terms of quality. However, he had a bigger cast, crew and lots more money for that and there is no doubt he would have made most of his later films like The Terminator if he wasn't given loads of dosh! (Damn Titanic studio execs!) However, The Terminator is a great, original film in its own right, perfectly suited to its 80's setting and besides it is also notable for making a star of Arnie. His monosyllabic T-800 became a cultural icon, getting more menacing as the film progresses into a thrilling climax.

It took a couple of years for the first one to reach me, but I did see The Terminator in a movie theatre and before Terminator 2 came out. I was actually surprised how well it worked, and having seen it countless times since then, I can confidently say it is just as effective now as it was back then.The effects look a little dated today, the synthesizer-based music is pretty laughable, and the movie has an overall cheap B-movie feel (which I usually don't like), but these are minor deficiencies that do not lessen my enjoyment. The greatest virtue of The Terminator is its relentless pace, and in this respect, it surpasses all the other instalments in the series. It truly makes you feel the machine is unstoppable and allows you no rest, no breather. And the final showdown in the factory, when the terminator presses on even when it's nothing but a legless torso, is genuinely scary and suspenseful.Great story, tense, chilling action, a perfectly cast, iconic character (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and one of the best pacing ever – The Terminator is a fantastic SF/action movie and a great debut for a great director.",The Terminator

401,ColeSear,Provocative though imperfect (Spoilers),8,14 August 2002,"This was the first time I had seen the original Terminator. While now it seems like it's going to be logistical nightmare it is definitely a film that leaves itself open for a sequel and eventually a third film.	We open with a very 80s fantasy set with spaceships flying shooting lasers at each other and then this huge tank steamrolling over skulls. The background is all blue with nothing distinguishing that it's the sky at all.	We then get a title insert giving us some back-story and/or fore-story telling us of the battle that lead to the world's destroyed state in 2028 and how in the present the true battle will be fought. It was truly a challenge to remember that much such that I could write it down because I hate any of those inserts at the beginning unless their purpose is comedic. I feel that when you're dealing with a visual medium and you have a lot of writing on the screen at the beginning you shouldn't expect anyone to remember it, the exception being those people who went to see Star Wars 55 times as compared to my zero. 	For the first forty minutes of the film it seems as if we're watching two characters making identical moves and are left to wonder if the script was written as half a script copied over with only the names being changed. However, slowly we find out that the Schwarzenegger character is the Terminator and the other person, Reese, who traveled through time, which is also very clouded at the beginning, are working in opposite purposes. 	What was set up by Cameron and Hurd in the beginning is a very interesting misinterpretation of facts. We see the police one deputy played by Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead) and the chief who just happens to be African-American (but I'll address that later) about two Sarah Connor's who had been killed. We also witness our main Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) see the TV news bulletin about the first murder which her friends find humorous and see her stunned reaction to the second and see her sitting around in fear this section was probably the best part of her inconsistent performance. 	As a director Cameron didn't seem to be very interested in creating too many intricate frames. There were a few shown during the war scenes where there was a lot of wreckage used as an obstruction and there was also some good framing in the parking garage with the use of wide angle shots. The focus seemed to be on lighting and using the color blue. There are scenes were everything is tinted blue. There also was a lot of use of floodlighting along with mist, fog, smoke and any effect of that sort they could find. This left the color palate was very muted and this lent itself to the somber tone that Cameron was attempting to create in the chases and stalking scenes also when Reese and Sarah were under the bridge for the night.	Story wise, however, there are some very good foreshadowing touches added. One being a waitress friend of Sarah's saying ""In a hundred years who's gonna care."" Where the essence of this film is examining how through time travel these people are attempting to secure the future both looking for drastically different results. Before Sarah ever sees Reese one of her friends is wearing a Jetson's shirt, small yes but any number of shirts could have been chosen and the filmmakers decided to drop some hints. 	Character-wise there is but one character who is worth talking about and that is the Terminator. Schwarzenegger's character is one who is symbolic of what humanity would become of we became overly dependent on computers/machines in that the Terminator itself is a machine with flesh. The Terminator is a film that was released in 1984 the year of Orwell's famous novel took place in and it was also a year where computer was still very new and misunderstood and the concept of Big Brother was still very alive. We see Reese has been branded with a bar code which seems to be both an attack on consumerism and Nazism by combining them in one symbol. While this is not the larger issue that the film deals with it most definitely should be a fact that no Science-Fiction film avoids social commentary in some way. 	The greatest accomplishment of this film is the way in which the Polaroid photograph was introduced in the end. It was an image haunting the story and it seemed to be the one piece of evidence that would prove the veracity of the whole plot to all those involved as if we weren't already willing to believe. The great failure of the film, however, is that Reese is the father of John Connor which was very predictable after they started talking on a more personal level. His death in 1984 makes up for it a bit but it doesn't take away the fact that I had that little voice nagging in the back of my head saying ""Don't be John's father! Don't be John's father! Don't be John's father!"" In the end Sarah Conner we sympathize with and she does end up being well drawn out even though when she got 'tough' her dialogue seemed forced and I think Cameron should have re-written the line to make it more believable. The only real problem with characters I had were the African-American characters who all had either walk throughs or supporting roles and seemed to be taken from the text How to Write a Stereotype. All in all The Terminator is a very intriguing and provocative science-fiction film.",The Terminator

404,andrewnmiller,A movie that all modern sci-fi and horror films aspire to be like.,10,26 March 2018,"Describing the 1984 classic, The Terminator is difficult for me because when I was young, I never saw it before due to being too young to watch it and so for a long time, it slipped under my viewing radar until late last year when I finally decided to give it a watch and after the end credits rolls, I was left in awe and wonderment at what I had just seen. From it's themes and dark and gritty feel to the directing and performances, The Terminator is truly a groundbreaker in terms of filmmaking.The film begins in the distant future where a nuclear holocaust has wiped out much of the human race and those who have survived are engaged in a brutal war with machines known as Terminators. In order to stop the human resistance from ever winning the war, a Terminator is sent back to 1984 to kill a young woman named Sarah Conner so her son will never lead the human race to victory. Unbeknownst to them, the resistance sends a lone solider named Kyle Reese back in time to the same year to protect Sara. Upon arriving, both Reese and the Terminator obtain clothing and weapons, meanwhile The Terminator deliberately begins murdering all women named Sara Conner. After looking her up in a telephone book, both men track Sara to a nightclub and once there, the Terminator almost kills her but Reese saves her and the two make a quick getaway while the Terminator pursues them. Now, Conner and Reese must do what they can to avoid this robotic killer while trying to reset the future. Upon viewing a couple movies by directors like Steven Spielberg or Stanley Kubrick, you begin to understand the way they approach certain elements of the film they're showing you, not just making the movie but also character interactions or small intricate details that help tell the story effectively. James Cameron is a fine example to use when describing this circumstance as he is a deeply talented director with a boundless disadvantage on what his filmmaking insight could be but with one high breakthrough with the Terminator and a whole other world opened for him. It's of little consequence if the director or writer doesn't makes sense of it, though some do such as Vincent Van Gogh who wrote about the creativeness he had passionately. Whichever way you choose to see it, when the movie viewing audience grasps a movie like The Terminator, the filmmaking world seems to alter as a film such as this shows both audiences and critics what can be done when a director puts his mind, heart and soul into a film and makes something truly special out of it. Cameron is an absolute force when it comes to filmmaking and a infamous perfectionist when it comes to telling stories, but all that paid off handsomely as the film maintains its rewatchability without coming across as pretentious while Cameron is a master of the small details like the police officer at his disk working on his form-filling with a small pencil and stops in the middle of a sentence to look up and see a car crashing though the front doors. Since James co-wrote the script, that makes the story even more intimate rather than just a solid achievement in directing as he apparently got his idea from a dream where he was being pursued by a mechanical skeleton with a bright red eye but I wouldn't be surprised if Cameron also drew inspiration from several episodes of the Outer Limits when coming up with ideas for the movie while the entire movie seems to always have an immediate, brutal atmospheric feel and a placid sensibleness which is distinctive of a bad dream which only seems to highten the tension and dread as the Terminator hunts down Sarah and Kyle and it seems there are only a few small moments in the film that allow the viewer to catch their breath not to mention never is there a scene that just feels like it's trying to pad out the running time nor does it dumb it's subject matter down to the lowest common denominator which also makes the film more approachable for the viewer.As for the filmmaking side of things, The Terminator certainly excels there too. The cinematography is to a very high standard with a dark, dirty and grungy look that makes the world Cameron has created feel much more lived in and believable while Stan Winston's stop-motion effects and Terminator endoskeleton is legendary in terms of their fluidity, movement and outright terror, but it's composer Brad Fiedel who deserves the most love: his pounding, techno-infused score is truly one of the finest film soundtracks of all time and perhaps even the best device Cameron has used in maintaining the movie's driving force. The score is astonishing, conflicting and grim all at the same time with a ceaseless bass line that keeps the movie appearing like it's not going to stop, not until the villain has be dealt with. One peculiar scene in the movie is a perfect representation of all these elements coming together under Cameron's masterful directing is the moment where both the Terminator and Kyle enter the Tech Noir club looking for Sarah. As the robot wanders though the place and advances towards the table where she is seated, the movie alternates into an unreal slow-mo as Conner drops a bottle on the floor and crouches to pick it long enough for the Terminator to forget her as he walks by. The 80s music now is faint due to the expansion of time as Brad's musical score comes into play, Sarah stands up and sees not the robot but Reese looking at her unaware that her pursuer is now circling back around and is nearly about to notice her but just when the slow-motion comes to its high point, Reese sees what Conner hasn't as the Terminator pulls a gun on her and is about to pull the trigger when Reese does the same and the viewer is suddenly thrown back into the here and now and all hell breaks loose. The amount of tension used in this one scene stays its course throughout the entirety of the movie which makes it one of cinema's most effective thrillers. Of course, the action in the Terminator shouldn't be overlooked as it's some of the finest out of any 80s action movie. The shoot out in the night club is a true masterstroke in terms of dread and tension as the Terminator and Reese duke it out and the robot takes the action up a level as he fires his gun as Kyle does the same. Once he's thrown though the glass, he gets up from the sidewalk and starts chasing Conner and Reese while the shoot-out at the police station is a perfect exercise in brutality as the robotic killing machine marches through the halls massacring everyone in sight while the scene of Sarah killing the Terminator is a benchmark of suspense and intensity. As for the cast, they're all fantastic: Linda Hamilton was born to play Sarah Conner, portraying her as a more grounded, naïve and defenseless character here rather than the battle-hardened badass we see in T2, yet it doesn't seem too mind-boggling she becomes that as the movie progresses and we see her grow as a character and begin to see the warrior side of her emerge practically at the end when she crushes the Terminator plus the chemistry between her and Biehn is prefect and any scene of them together is always a treat to watch. Michael Biehn is absolutely fantastic as Kyle Reese, portraying him as a scrawny, thin and realistic hero, so much so that the minute he's introduced, it's difficult not to see his helplessness when you see the scars across his body when he comes out of the portal and when he battles the Terminator, he is outclassed which allows the viewer to see his weaknesses as a character as does his willingness to give up his own life for his cause shows just how hopeless his situation is, something Jai Courtney failed to do in Genisys. Lance Henriksen is wonderful in his role as the police sergeant as is Earl Boen and even Bill Paxton pops up in a small role, but it's Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular villain who makes the movie so wonderful to watch. Even with his limited dialog, Arnie still is able to kick to tension up to 11 whenever he is on screen To declare that the Terminator had a foreboding presence on screen would be putting it mildly, he's absolutely terrifying as a villain due to his simple motivation of killing Sarah and nothing else which is what makes him such an effective villain and not your standard greedy bad guy with no motives we contently see now a days.Honestly, is there anything else that needs to be said about the Terminator that others haven't said already? It's a must see movie even if you're not a fan of sci-fi or horror. Go watch it now.",The Terminator
405,srobi280,Arnold's legendary performance,10,6 April 2006,"I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, because most people know what it is. This is one of Arnold's best movies out there. This role was crafted to fit him perfectly. From the very beginning until the very end, the excitement and action don't let up. I watch this movie religiously. The plot is amazing, and the directing is incredible. I love the part where he punches right into the chest cavity of that punk. I also thought the part at the end where his skin melts off and he is coming after them was eerie. Perfect. This movie is a definite must-see!If you haven't seen it yet, do it now!",The Terminator
406,Gjay2,when arnie was great,8,26 March 2003,"i saw this when i was about 9 years old. It was the film which you tell your friends you've seen, so they would think you were cool.Complex plotting and some stellar action sequences make this a classic of the sci-fi genre. And no matter how cheap the effect look today, it still carries the same effect it did all those years ago. Although these days, seeing a character gun down cops by the dozen, isn't as shocking as i'm sure it would've been when this movie came out to the public. It shocks in more ways too, probably seen as a very daring film in it's day.Arnie does his best when he doesn't have to speak so much. Very cool in his black leather jacket, riding his motorcycle, he is as menacing as they come. Linda hamilton plays the helpless victim well and michael biehn fits the role of the hero comfortably. Dialogue may not be great, but the story is intact and tight enough to get the tension buzzing. Which it does superbly. Great film, strangely becomes cooler with age.",The Terminator
407,Asentiff2004,I'll be back!!,8,25 December 2013,"In the post apocalyptic future of 2029, a war is being fought, a war between humans and the machines. With time running out for the machines they send back into the past one of its most devastating killers, a cyborg posed to look like a human, the Terminator. It has been sent to eliminate Sarah Connor, matriarch to the leader of the human resistance, but the resistance has managed to send back a protector for Sarah. Only time will tell who will reach her first....A fantastic action movie, original in concept and one of Arnold's most iconic roles. The Terminator is fast paced, expertly directed which will entice and suck the viewer in from the first five mins of the film. This film I believe was what launched Arnold into movie stardom as well as Cameron who would both see continued success after this film. The Terminator was far from done as this film would spawn 3 sequels and an eventual fourth in years to come from now. An instant fan favorite, everything about this film is done right, the effects though aged were top notch of the time of its release, the action still gritty and in your face. The story though clichéd at certain instances, still has enough originality to make it special and something more than a simple action movie. The score fits perfectly within the mold of the film. The Terminator is a must see for film buffs as it is now considered a classic among the action film genre.",The Terminator

Sarah Connor is such a cool character. Kyle Reese is whatever but Arnold as the t-800 is such an intimidating antagonist. The on the run feel of the movie is so cool.

An eighties sci-fi film that is as enjoyable today as when it was first released. Watching it today, Michael Biehn gives the strongest performance. He's passionate, sincere, and at all times believable. Linda Hamilton does a great job as Sarah Connor. It's hard to imagine anyone else in this role. See it. And see it again.",The Terminator
411,botrytis,"Just a Masterpiece, nothing less",10,14 January 2017,"Terminator (1) is a sci-fi/action/noir movie with a straightforward storytelling about time travel, indestructible killer machine, and everything that was 80s all about.Cool Pop/rock Disco musics, 80s fashion, the electronic dark soundtrack reflecting the overshadowing story prior scenes which take place mostly in night-time, blue/red neon lights and lasers, love scene between two desperate yet heroic characters (but not in a cheese way, no sir). Everything is just perfectly lined up, telling a very dark story which holds its apocalyptic atmosphere throughout the movie from start to the end. You just smell the 80's all over the film, leaving you in such territory of feelings that today's movies cannot give, they just can't. The time travel concept suddenly becomes one with the movie's antic factor, as this period of our history presented here is no more, even if people are desperately trying to bring us back in time with their nostalgia today, no effort is enough to give us the real feelings as this movie does.""Burnin' on the third degree""; ""You can't do that to me""; only the choice of music gives the right view to Cameron's sense of conceptualism, reflecting the cool and innocent Sarah suddenly grabbed by an unfortunate, overshadowing sorrow, as the Terminator comes to terminate her for actions that haven't even occurred from her view. Then ""Pictures of you, from another time and place"" puts Kyle Reese into this concept as he held the one and only photo of the woman of importance, Sarah Connor. Besides all this the seemingly unavoidable dark future paints the sonic foundation to the whole soundtrack, its futuristic, robotic, and deadly, but most importantly; overshadowing.The story elegantly emerges prior the scenes, built around the dark tension the movie is based on, giving the right informations at the right time in a really fast yet healthy phase. The acting is also spot on, especially Linda Hamilton's natural talent manifests itself in any kind of scene, let it be action, drama, horror. This also applies to Michael Biehn, even though there are some almost ""not that good"" acting from his part, however these are rare moments. And of course there is Arnie, with his muscles and plain face, that are quite enough for a part like THE TERMINATOR itself.With these elements above Cameron managed to create something so perfectly pure, that it just puts his latter movies look so below class. The Terminator 2: Judgement Day that came after this maintained the quality the Terminator 1 embraced, yet it couldn't remotely bring the same tension and atmosphere that the original movie had, however anything else was brought to the next level by which the movie Terminator 2 - from technical point of view - is still up to date. Terminator (1) relatively has some effects which can be considered out of date, however this immediately drops out of equation as we bring up the artistic quality of its, that couldn't and cannot be outdone by any kind of Cameron's latter productions. And that is the kind of quality that I hold most dearly. Terminator 1 is easily the best in the series, that can be watched more times than any of the sequels. 9.5/10",The Terminator
412,MinorityReporter,One of the best action movies of the 80s!,9,13 January 2007,"This movie is something of an enigma to me. It comes from an era in the history of film where a lot of really bad movies were made. Especially sci-fi movies suffered a lot of indignities (not counting Blade Runner, Aliens and the two Star Wars movies made in the decade) but also good action movies were quite far apart. For this movie to be a success in both genres is quite something. This is James Cameron's first masterpiece.Acting wise the movie is nothing short of excellent. Arnold Schwarzenegger produced the role that would turn out to be his signature role in the terminator. His acting is wooden, stiff and very emotionless which is of course perfect as he plays a robot from the future and even though he was outmatched villain wise by Robert Patrick's T-1000 in the sequel he is still very memorable in this movie and the ""I'll be back"" line is one of the most memorable of the 80s. Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor and creates a very likable, vulnerable and at the same time strong character and you can't help but sympathize with her. The strongest performance in my opinion is that of Michael Biehn who very unjustly never became a really big name in the movie industry because his performance as Kyle Reese is everything movie acting should be about. His character is both very strong but at the same time emotionally crippled. The way he plays the role with the exact right amount of desperation is pure genius. Lance Henriksen is critically underused in his role and unfortunately doesn't have enough screen time to really create a lasting impression and that's a shame.The effects and action sequences are remarkably well construed, breath taking and exciting. James Cameron proves that he has a flair for action with this movie and even though the effects are dated they still somehow hold their own in a time where computer effects are dominating action movies. Especially the ending is very thrilling mainly because of the editing which basically makes the ending. The stop-motion elements of the movie work remarkably well, once again because of the editing. The film also uses full size puppets molded after Arnold's face and body and because of the lighting (and again the editing) you barely notice the change between real actor and puppet. Brad Fiedel's score has a very 80s feel to it and is practically the only thing that is not timeless about the movie.All in all The Terminator is definitely one of the best action and sci-fi movies of the eighties and indeed any age. If you haven't seen it yet, you should. Don't think it's just another Schwarzenegger movie, it is so much more.9/10",The Terminator
413,meissotruey,I'm confused a bit (Director's Cut Review),5,2 September 2020,"I start with cons, cause there are too many. During watching i felt indifference. I didn't spent any time with each of characters(i don't really know them) so how can i be with them, share their emotions? All we know and see is kinda formal, Kyle emotional speech(on nature, in the morning) feels like outta nowhere. And also this 2 minute instant love looks strange. I can't relate to Sarah also because she don't act rational, she kinda simple and not really smart(okay, maybe it's my personal reasons), but do not forget about what i said before ""we do not really know these characters"". Well, if Kyle as simple as he looks, we can assume that we know him, but again, we have no idead about the certain events of his life, we didn't see him much among people to grasp his full personal portait. And even when we see the future, we are not that impressed by effects of that time to fully believe in dangers of war, moreover it looks both boring and unreal(in sense that you don't feel like it is happening for real), very much like action scenes. Lore is kinda simple and not intriguing. So we can come up with the conclusion that this movie has not many things to offer to the viewer. But now to the pros: shooting is quite good, Arnold acting Terminator is convincing(though it is not a simple role), overall acting is authentic, we do not just hear that Kyle is a soldier but we see every aspect of it( war flashbacks, raws, his slim body, his fighting skills, he is not afraid, he don't really pays attention to his wounds(and also not used to think abouth not critical pain), when soldier from future can knock out policeman without using hands), Terminator looks terrifying, decorations is good, movie itself aged not bad(unlike Star Wars 1 or 4 or any before the new ones). So, for the attention to details and caring i'll give it additional star, but i can't rate this film any high. If you not that of true cinematography lovers or art lovers, yeah, many people say the are, but, in fact, nearly no one is. If you think that Nolan Batman movies are good, you probably like it very much, but actually it just reflects your absence of atteintion and taste(no offense, but more or less my ratings and reviews(my approach to rate and review) aimed on minor audience that wanna see something really outstanding, or unconventional or spent their time not bad in the worst case). But here is the thing, Terminator 1984 as enetertainment or let's say ""good time spent"" and it is not art.",The Terminator
414,watto124,Great time-travelling fun!.........but not as good and dramatic as T2.....,9,11 August 2000,"A great film, the Terminator packs a wallop as far as casting, acting, writing, and basically everything is concerned, but, however, the film suffers (mildly) from the cheap musical score (except the opening theme). Now, a very dramatic and serious pic such as this one should'nt have such bad synthesized music. But I understand that the film was made on an unbelievably small budget. The special effects are terrific, the story is ingeniuos, and AHNOLD is cooler than ever!",The Terminator
415,RyanEberhart,Excellent!,8,27 September 2013,"The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies.The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic.The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be ""bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.""The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger).As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end.The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes.The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel.The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it.Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger.I give this 8 stars out of 10.",The Terminator
416,xiaoli7377,Schwarzenegger and Cameron's Breakout Film,9,9 September 2020,"""The Terminator"" is always a classic, high-octane thrill ride that hits all of the right sci-fi and thriller points for me. I think a lot of people misclassify the original 1984 film as an action movie, when I feel like it's a lot more in tone with other sci-fi suspense thrillers of the time like ""Halloween"" and ""Alien."" There is an unstoppable, inhuman threat out there that won't stop until it devours its prey. It's certainly much less bombastic than any of its sequels, and while I don't personally like it as much as ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", one can't deny the charm and captivating nature of the original movie. Produced on a low budget, ""The Terminator"" made due with what it had, which was incredible miniature and stop motion effects, an actually serious and intimidating Arnold Schwarzenegger that wasn't played for laughs, and a haunting, robotic synth score that perfectly matched the tone and setting of the film.Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a single waitress living in Los Angeles in the year 1984. In the near future, an all-out nuclear war will wipe out most of humanity from the face of the earth. An artificial intelligence will take over the defense networks of countries across the globe in an effort to destroy mankind. Sarah will one day mother John Connor, the leader of the resistance who will eventually defeat the machine army and free humanity. In a last ditch effort, the machines send a Terminator cyborg (Schwarzenegger) back to the year 1984 in order to kill John before he is even born. The resistance also sends back someone to protect Sarah and destroy the Terminator, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn).It's classic science fiction, and I recommend it to any fan of the genre. Although I think that Cameron's direction and action spectacle would be improved on in ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2"", ""The Terminator"" is still a great thrill ride and a great foundation for Cameron to build upon. Some of the visuals are a bit dated and don't hold up too well at all. But it's a bit forgivable considering the age and lower budget of this one. The miniature effects in the future scenes still look pretty good.Check out ""The Terminator"" when you get the chance for some fun sci-fi action and suspense.",The Terminator

419,Hellrazr360,"""I'll Be Back"", For This Masterpiece Several Times",10,3 February 2006,"Terminator is one of those unforgettable masterpieces that will always be admired for how it stunned us. How Cameron managed to create such a tense and passionate movie is, needless to say, amazing.I'm pretty sure most of you are aware of the plot of the Terminator movies so I'll spare you those details, despite their importance. But the plot of the Terminator movies introduced here is both intriguing and interesting. The whole story is given to the audience by Micheal Beihn, who does an excellent job of fulfilling his role. Beihn also gives some excellent and memorable lines while delivering the story and gives each and every detail great seriousness. It's this effect that Beihn manages to pull off that helps the viewer get drawn in by this movie's story.Actors Lance Heinriksen, Bill Paxton and actress Linda Hamilton also make appearances in this movie, which may very well be the movie that got their careers started. But of course I'd be a fool to talk about Terminator's performers without mentioning the T-Man himself, Arnold. I don't think anyone could play our favorite cyborg like Arnie himself did. It's Arnold's unique, robot-like voice that gives him such an authentic acting flair in this movie, especially the good shape he was in. As the Terminator himself, Arnie got the pleasure of taking the load of action scenes, but with those scenes comes guns, which we know he loves.Hamilton has the next largest role in the movie next to Arnold and Beihn, and she's does a great job herself. Hamilton does excellent at acting as a hard-working girl early in the film and does even better as someone who has to deal with an undeniable truth. The rest of the cast let the movie flow its way but do their importance when it comes, which is something most movies avoid nowadays.The presentation of the Terminator isn't flashy, but what else would you expect from a film from the mid 80's. The action in the Terminator is both tense and very satisfying. Add that to the near-perfect style of the rest of the movie up till the end and the Terminator is a movie that you will not be disappointed by.",The Terminator

Terminator is the best movie Saga of the Terminator.
After Terminator follows, Terminator 2 Judgement Day (1991), Terminator 3 Rise of Machines (2003), Terminator 4 Salvation (2009), Terminator Genesis (2015) and finally Terminator Dark Fate (2019) are the best Terminator legacy",The Terminator
422,DaRick89,The wonderful action movie which started a wonderful action saga,10,22 January 2006,"The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this, there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such, this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling, almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions, which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre, because of it's well thought-out plot, splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.Now to analysing why the plot is so well-thought out. Well, for one thing, the concept of preventing or setting in stone the future by going back in time was one which wasn't really explored in those days. By exploring it, the Terminator was offering something different, something which has inspired films such as Back to the Future (read the plot synopsis for that film, there are a few similarities). The notion of the final battle of a future war being fought in 'our present', not in the future, between one member of opposing sides, in this case a man and a machine, is also an intriguing one and sets the stage for an exciting battle royale.I'll run down the plot while I'm here. Sarah Connor, a young woman in her 20's, is the protagonist of the film and our two from the future, Kyle Reese and the Terminator, revolve around her. Reese, who is a battle-hardened soldier who has led a hard life in the wasteland which is the future, must protect Sarah, while the Terminator, an unstoppable cyborg, must kill her, in order to kill her unborn son, the leader of the future resistance.All of this leads to some thrilling action scenes and insane explosions, topped off by music scores which add to the tension and excitement. The movie purrs into action quickly, but really kicks off at a disco, where Reese and the Terminator have a shootout, resulting in a city-wide drive-by chase involving the police which doesn't really let up until Reese and Sarah are arrested. During the lull in the chase scene, Reese tells Sarah about himself, the Terminator and their general predicament, which is fairly realistic. The next action scene is the infamous police station massacre which everyone seems to talk about whenever they discuss this movie. I can understand why, too. The Terminator pretty much kills every cop in his path with the greatest of ease, either with the AK-47, his shotgun, or both. He also ends up cutting the power and setting the station on fire, again adding to the tension and excitement. The last action scene which, like the one in T2, is a chase which leads to a final showdown in a building. It is a slight letdown, but it is still an intense scene. I will refrain from spoiling the ending, as this is too good a movie to be spoiled.All of the acting fits the bill perfectly. As in T2, there is not a single bad performance to be found. Michael Biehn delivers a remarkably intense performance as Kyle Reese, acting like a typical human would in his situation. He displays his range of emotions at the right times, from passionate to worried to unyielding. It is a wonder that his only other major movie is 'Aliens' and that he is starring in stuff like 'Clockstoppers' these days. Linda Hamilton again does well as Sarah Connor, displaying an innocent woman who shows over the course of the film why she is John Connor's mother, displaying previously unheralded steel at the crunch. The support cast isn't too bad either (Dr. Silberman makes his first appearance). But again, the best performance in the film belongs to the bad guy, in this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He acts like a killing machine should; incredibly cold, sterile, soulless and unyielding. His facial expression never changes throughout the film and his physical appearance makes him slightly more imposing and intimidating than the Liquid Terminator. He also commences his famous one-liners which have been the subject of many a spoof, including (no, especially) ""I'll be back."" This is undoubtedly his best performance, even though it is not his only good one.I will compliment all involved on making a movie which still manages to look good despite having a low budget. I've seen pretty bad-looking movies with fairly high budgets (read: Scooby-Doo), but never good-looking movies with low budgets.In the end, The Terminator is a masterful action movie which laid the groundwork for the equally brilliant Terminator 2. If you asked me whether I preferred The Terminator or T2, I would say T2 because I am more familiar with it, otherwise, these two would be on a level footing. If you haven't seen this movie and are an action movie fan, then see it immediately. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.5/5 stars",The Terminator

424,josephrygaard,Before Watching: The Terminator (1984),9,14 September 2019,"""The Terminator"" (1984) or just ""Terminator"" is a classic sci-fi movie as well as the start of the sci-fi saga with the same name. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Terminator is a pure 80's movie. It includes action elements like guns, explosions and shootings, together with some rock-hard testosterone from Schwarzenegger himself. The score is superb, being a mixture of analogue synths together with futuristic sound effects. The special effects and stop motion are quite obviously from the 80's as well, being a bit premature yet not too clunky. All in all - very 80's straight through, and it has in this aspect very similar vibes to Aliens and Die Hard.However, Terminator also features very human elements and feelings. Relationships feel real, and although crude language and nudity occur, the atmosphere is surprisingly cozy in-between the action. Perhaps due to the strong 80's vibe and subsequent nostalgia, yet in this aspect it is the strongest entry in the franchise. The time travel paradoxes don't stumble but flow smoothly in the narrative, although it will still require some attention.A slight in-depth note: a few viewers might wonder why Terminator sometimes isn't as accurate of a shooter as you would expect a computer to be. One plausible explanation could be that, according to the movie, the technological advancements stopped or slowed down considerably in 1997 when the war began. If the CPU in Terminator is on roughly the same level, perhaps some calculations for bullet trajectories could struggle to be calculated and executed in real-time.Conclusively - Terminator is a great gem in both being an entertaining and human sci-fi, as well as being a prime demonstration on the topmost shape of 80's movies. Now, go and see Terminator 2 - Judgment Day.My personal grade: an electrifying 9/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",The Terminator
425,abum190,"Ah, Ahnold",8,28 April 2006,"He's buff, stone-faced, and genuinely scary in this movie- my first thought at the end of this movie was ""He'd make a good governor of California."" Well, perhaps not. But it's hard to imagine The Terminator without Schwarzeneggar (I attempted to spell it without looking), and maybe that's only because the Terminator and Arnold have become synonymous since 1984. You can't think Terminator without thinking ""Ah'll be back."" Of course, I wasn't even born in '84, so I don't really know how the movie was received before he became a cultural icon, but from the perspective of a 16-year-old here and now, I think it's a great movie.When you ignore the fact that now Ahnold is and always will be the Terminator, you can see that he really was good in the role. Sure, there isn't much for him to do- he talks in monotone, glares, and flexes- but his build, his accent, his face, everything about him was built for playing a robot- excuse me, cyborg. Kyle Reese would yell at me for being so glib.The hero of the movie, the aforementioned Kyle Reese, is played by Michael Biehn, who has a few shining moments, but doesn't really impress for the rest of the film. Linda Hamilton, on the other hand, shines throughout the entire movie as a young woman whose entire life turns upside down. She doesn't do the girlish freakout, a cliché that has grown really old, probably even by 1984; instead, she focuses on the fact that her life depends on every move she makes- while still showing fear. Hamilton pulls that off magnificently, despite a script that throws a few cheesy lines her way, thought she handles the cheese a lot better than Biehn does.I may sound pretty critical so far, what with the cheese and my disappointment with one of the main stars, but the truth is, despite those flaws, the rest of the movie delivers. Some people say this movie has an anti-nuclear-war message- I say, sure, for maybe five minutes. This isn't a message movie- it's a thriller, full of meaty action that really does thrill. The whole movie is basically a chase scene, but the chasing is gripping and creatively laid out. The only other James Cameron film I've seen is Titanic, and with these two movies I can tell that Cameron is very good at engaging the audience in intelligent action. The plot line is as creative as the action with its detailed mythology and harrowing climax. I don't want to ruin any of it though, because it's really a good story. Just see it, and you'll understand.It's a fun movie, and by now has been raised into the classic zone. And after seeing it a few times and not tiring of it in the least, I can see why.",The Terminator
426,NotASmartCritic,"This was good too but, the second terminator did better than this",8,27 December 2018,"I like this one too, this one started it all, the terminator series is great, i gave this an 8/10 cuz the second movie had more action scenes was more entertaining, this one is entertaining too but not as entertaining as the second one",The Terminator
427,CatfishOpinions,Super fun action thriller >:))),8,16 November 2020,"I love this movie so much because it's exactly the kind of movie I would want to make- an action romance with thriller elements and tons of fun scenes. I love the relationship with Kyle and Sarah and unlike a lot of other movies, their romance is actually necessary to the plot and makes sense. I also like how they respect dogs.If there's anything to criticize, the gore was a little hard to take (granted I'm never a fan of that anyway) and the final chase scene special effects didn't age very well. Still has that lovable 80s charm to it, though, so it's okay.All in all I love it. I thought people were hyping it up too much but I actually really understand why it's so popular and well-loved. Would re-watch anytime.",The Terminator
428,vivifan,A very well made Sci fi action movie that is worth anyone's time,9,30 March 2019,"The first terminator is a very nostalgic movie to me. As a child I saw the third movie which wasn't a good movie at all due to it's bad storyline, cheesy writing, bad characters and overall lacklustre experience. I decided to go back and watch the first two movies and they were much much better. This movie is great and was a more engaging film with great characters, soundtrack, tone, writing, and the terminator being more interesting/badass. The action scenes are fun to watch, the drama is well done, it's funny with the terminators come backs etc. The relationship between Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor was believable. The films pacing was really well done also I never felt bored in the movie due to it's solid directing. It's acting is good tho certain characters could've done better. The film isn't perfect due to some scenes being a little drawn out and some characters are developed enough. But it's an overall fantastic movie and is a must watch.",The Terminator
429,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,An 80's Classic,10,14 July 2018,"The Terminator (1984) ReviewStarring Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sarah Connor (Hamilton) is a push over waitress who gets through her days like every other normal person. A cyborg disguised as a man is sent through time to kill her. He searches through phone books to locate every Sarah Connor he can find ruthlessly killing all of them. Kyle Reese (Biehn) is sent through time to protect her eventually finding her just in time before the cyborg gets to her. There is great chemistry between the two leads but Arnold steals the show. He was originally going to be the hero but decided to go out of the box by convincing James Cameron to make him the villain. It was a great move because he is considered one of the best villains of all time. With his thick Austrian accent he plays a perfect robot.Sci-Fi films of the 80s never really took themselves seriously. They were often cheesy and dumb with lousy special effects but The Terminator was a game changer. It took the genre very seriously and it results in a very grounded film. Full of great dramatic moments and some brilliant performances, it really plays around with different genres. It's a relentless neo-noir, chase thriller filled with breathtaking action sequences and eye popping special effects. Beneath all of this there's drama, suspense and horror. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scary bastard playing an efficient cold blooded killer who will stop at nothing to complete his mission. There are so many intense action scenes from a nightclub shootout, a car chase through the streets of LA, a police station slaughter and a tense climactic pursuit. All of them are well executed never going on for too long and they never outstay their welcome. Writer/director James Cameron wrote a superb screenplay with fully fleshed out characters who have great story arcs. Kyle Reese is a seasoned warrior who is put in a fish out of water type scenario. He's a conflicted man who's seen some nasty crap and clearly suffers from PTSD. He's been in some sticky situations before and he's a character we can really root for. Sarah Connor starts out as the damsel in distress who by the end becomes a hardened strong woman prepared for the grim future that awaits. The music score by Brad Fiedel is tense, emotional, exciting and memorable. The special effects look incredible from the scene where the Terminator is repairing himself to the future war scenes. Everything just looks and sounds great and though a few shots look a little bit dated today they still hold up very well. It's a timeless film that will be enjoyed for decades to come because it's just so different in its approach the genre.",The Terminator
430,DesertDogMedia,The Terminator,7,1 August 2014,"Title: The Terminator Condensed Storyline: A robot assassin is sent back in time to kill the mother of a future resistance leader Notable Acting: This movie had a great cast of actors who would be known for this movie for the rest of their careers. The secondary character were also great and added to the story as a good secondary character should. Noticeable Camera work: I do not need to say that there will be no interesting or unique shots in this movie, mainly because it is an 80's movie and movies weren't all too interested in showing us their ability to use their camera in unique ways until the 2000s Costume: The actor playing the Terminator may not blend in, but his punk clothing sure does blend into the punk sceneIncorrect Science: The Terminator buys an automatic Uzi at one point. I may be from a country which has a choke hold on owning firearms, but I know that fully automatic weapons are illegal in America and that any gun store selling fully automatic weapons wouldn't have them up on a wall. The paradox of Kyle being John's father along with the cliché of the woman getting pregnant after the first time they've had sex (I know it's possible, but it's still a cliché) Kyle points out that Terminators are suppose to blend in, this doesn't work when you have a body builder with a thick foreign accent playing the role. ""Only living things can go through the teleporter"" This works good for this movie, but not for the second movie when the Terminator is liquid metal with no skin.Overall Feel: This is the movie which elevated the knowledge of its main actors, before this movie only a hand full of people would know Arnold as he played Conan a couple years before, it is a similar story for the other two main actors. But this movie made their names known. Sadly I cannot say that this movie is my favourite, as that goes to Terminator 2, but this was the movie that set the wheels in motion for the franchise. The idea for the Terminator was actually take from a book outside of the franchise which also involved time travel assassinations and was credited.",The Terminator
431,epalejandrocarrillo,Cold war classic.,9,26 October 2019,"James Cameron's 1984 the terminator inspired by Harlan Ellison was a movie of its time, a cold war warning of possible things to come. A killing machine from a posible future is sent back in time to kill Sarah Conor in order to prevent the birth of John Conor the leader of the human resistance against the machines that are trying to wipe out humanity. As a kid games like missile command and movies like war games were a constant reminder of the possibility of a nuclear war. Never really considering what might start a nuclear war the intelligent machine sci-fi aspect of the movie is original. A Terminator hunting down mercilessly is a terrifying thought. Extremely well paste, the editing is amazing, the visuals are very well done especially for its time. Although it is extremely dated this movie is effective, terrifying and a masterpiece. James Cameron solidified his place as a brilliant filmmaker.",The Terminator
432,Lt_Coffey_182,"Pure, dark brilliance",10,22 June 2003,"I have always loved this film, for well over half my life. I was about 6 when I first saw it, 12 years ago. T2 had always been my favourite film but recently, The Terminator has eclipsed T2 to become my favourite movie of all time. There is so much more to this film than its sequel. T2 is simple action whereas this film is an action, romance, horror and suspense thriller all rolled in to one.The Terminator's story is very strong and eclipses every Sci-Fi film there is. The idea of time travel has always fascinated me and, whilst this film does not explore as much as Back to the Future does, the intricate description of Reese going back through time and the bleak setting of the future world is highly imaginative. Cameron does really well at capturing the audience's attention and imagination and shows how talented a director and writer he is. The love story between Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is beautiful. The idea of a man travelling back in time to protect the woman he loves is so wonderful and sentimental. As well as having a good story, this film is highly entertaining. The TechNoir bar scene, the car chase and the police station scene are especially good and are absolutely stunning to watch.The acting in this film is brilliant. Arnie was not at all developed when it came to acting which made him much less human which is very effective when playing a cyborg. Schwarzenegger is not in this film to deliver lines with any power, but is in more as a physical force and someone who appears unstoppable. Kyle Reese is, for me, the best hero ever and he is played by my favourite actor. His intense vulnerability makes him very interesting and the way he is so prepared to sacrifice himself for the mission objective, the love of his life. Biehn is so good in this role as he plays protector very well but does perfectly at playing someone 'lost in time'. Biehn's performance in this film is sadly underrated but for me, it is completely unforgettable. Linda Hamilton is brilliant in this film and her character's gradual transformation, which is completed in Terminator 2, is very convincing. Her ability at appearing terrified is equally convincing. There is also good support from Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield as the policemen investigating the case. They do well to give the film a touch of humour and their contrasting personalities makes an effective pairing.The fact that this film was made on a small budget also impresses me, especially as the special effects don't work out too badly, except for the stop motion scene where the endoskeleton is chasing Kyle and Sarah. Stan Winston is a special effects genius and it is incredible to look at all the films he has worked on. His wizardry at transforming James Cameron's artwork to solid matter is very impressive to say the least.Also good is Brad Fiedel's score. Whilst it is simplistic and completely on a synthesizer, it matches the mood of the film perfectly, and is very effective at getting an adrenaline rush. Also, the Terminator theme is a classic tune that will live on in eternity just like the Jaws theme. Tahnee Cain and the Tryanglz make up the bulk of the small amount of songs The Terminator has to offer and like the score, their songs reflect the atmosphere of the film.An intensely stylish film that benefits very well from being shot mainly at night to give a real dark atmosphere, Terminator rose above a moderate budget to become an all time classic. The Terminator did a fantastic job at bringing credibility back to the Sci-Fi genre and simultaneously show the importance of a human theme. Almost everyone has seen this film, if you haven't, you really must! James Cameron at his very best.",The Terminator
433,Ajk2386,Amazing and entertaining,10,21 November 2018,This is a true 80s classic and I personally like it more than T2 (even though T2 is also amazing) The action sequences are awesome and Sarah Conner is pretty hot.,The Terminator
434,eldergod-1,One of the best movies ever,9,10 November 2004,"With this low-budget scifi movie one of the greatest series in the history of cinema begins.

A lone human warrior, also sent from the future, must confront him and save Sarrah, for she is to give birth to a great leader, who can defeat the Terminators in a chilling war in not-so-far future. But how can a man and a woman stop an invincible robot of terrible power? This is a great film. The actors are excellent, especially Arnold. The action is very interesting and seems very real.

435,vav-61764,The Terminator Distinguises From Most of Action/Sci-Fi Movies With Its Original and Incredible Story,8,8 July 2015,"The Terminator is considered a breakthrough among the movies of its gender and it's undeniable that James Cameron has changed how the action movies were made with this film. The apprehension, the awareness as the terminator is getting closer to his objective, is really exciting and as the movie goes on, it only gets better. The visual effects, particularly the makeup used in Arnold Schwarzenegger to reveal some parts of the robotic skeleton beneath the human-tissue, are surprisingly good. The CGI, even being from the 80's so you can rapidly notice when the chroma key is being used, are fine and work very fine to me.Arnold Schwarzenegger as the terminator was really good, his gestures interpreting a robot managed to portray something without feelings through the lack of changes in facial expression regardless of what is happening, who has a single purpose and will not stop until achieve it. One of his iconic lines is firstly said in this movie. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn succeeded in making a remarkable performance that until now they have influence in the others who portray these characters in more recent movies. One aspect to be noticed is the stalking feeling, fear and powerlessness which Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) feel around them, having an almost indestructible creature looking for them.",The Terminator
436,ThreeThumbsUp,"Good, not great",7,4 May 2011,"This movie, like Die Hard, was one of the films I simply did not watch growing up. I was born in the era, but for some reason or another didn't find the urge to give in. That is until 2011.Though I thought it was good, I'm not quite sure Terminator lived up to its reputation. I mean, the stop-motion special effects disappointed me and the lack of action in the beginning was a little off-putting. Also, the storyline seemed to stretch a little bit. But I guess that happens when you deal with a time travel in a movie. It takes a little extra concentration to get everything straight.I did, however, enjoy most of the film. The action scenes were well-choreographed and the tension was high during the Terminators' ruthless massacre. The acting was above average and the dialog was nothing special, but good.All-in-all, The Terminator wasn't a masterpiece but it was entertaining...and that's all you can ask for I guess. I hear the second installation released in 1991 is much better. And oh yeah, I've since seen Die Hard.",The Terminator

One of the best films in history!!!,10,7 November 2006,"This is that kind of film were everything is perfect: Plot, characters, atmosphere, music, FX, etc... and also is that kind of film you can watch a million times and will always be entertaining. It was perfect in 1984, now, and will still be perfect in 30 years! The terminator is the perfect role for Arnold. You cannot think of Arnold not attaching him the terminator character.Sadly they made sequels for this film, and I don't think they are better than the original. I liked the second part but there are a couple things in T2 that do not match for me, for example how different Sarah Connor is. All in all the second part is OK. Now with T3 they really ruined the story in so many ways that I will not mention here.I love The Terminator and it will always be one of my favorite movies, not only because the movie was perfect, but because it has a message for people, about nuclear development.",The Terminator
438,compi24,"Review Of ""The Terminator""",8,8 September 2011,"I honestly don't think that this movie needs an introduction, but I'll give it one anyway - ""The Terminator"" is a 1984 film crafted by legendary filmmaker James Cameron. The film follows tells the story of a cyborg assassin (Schwarzenegger) who is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill a young woman (Hamilton). Well, starting from the top, the movie's premise is certainly bizarre and outlandish, though Cameron and team seem to successfully transcend this obstacle by presenting the film's plot with utmost realism and seriousness. Quite possibly the greatest aspect of the film is, in fact, Arnold Schwarzenegger's truly menacing portrayal of the titular character. I wouldn't go so far as to say that this was a difficult performance, but Arnold pulls off one of his earliest acting roles with an intense amount of menace. The action sequences were also a masterstroke aspect of the film. Nearly every set piece in the film contained a good dose of thrills and jaw-dropping moments. The movie itself is, arguably, one of the greatest and most revolutionary science fiction films in film history. ""The Terminator"" was one of the first films to introduce the concept of self-aware artificial intelligence to the big screen, it catapulted the careers of Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron to new heights, and simultaneously introduced several memorable lines of dialogue that most people are familiar with. In 2008 ""The Terminator"" was selected by the Library Of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Did it deserve this honor? I believe so. For, ""The Terminator"" was a fun, intelligent, novel film for me to experience.",The Terminator
439,jerome_horwitz,"It's 1984, and Arnold's career is launching into the unknown!",8,5 February 2006,"The Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn, is about a dark future of Earth that leads to a battle in present day. How can this be? Simply, in 2029 time travel will be possible.The mission for the Terminator is simple: kill Sarah Connor. Destroy anything or anyone that tries to prevent this from happening.The mission for Kyle Reese isn't so simple: locate Sarah Connor and prevent her from being destroyed by the Terminator.The movie does quite a nice job of explaining many details. You learn quite a bit about all of the basics of the future war, how the machines come to power, primarily when Reese explains all of this to Connor.It's a fairly simple plot and isn't difficult to understand. This is acceptable, because it's an action movie and doesn't really need much explanation. Of course, as an action movie this movie definitely delivers, with some very detailed and gory scenes. A few examples are the Terminator punching through someone and pulling his arm out, the killing of 30 law officers in a police station, and point blank assassinations of Sarah Connors. The movie can be very creepy as well, so there is some potential scare factor as well.As of this writing, The Terminator does show a few signs of aging. The music is very 80s with a lot of synthesizers. There's the typical big 80's hair. A lot of the props are date-able as well, such as the cars.This really can be overlooked though, because end to end this action flick is spectacular.8/10",The Terminator

Much better story, in some ways, than the one when the Terminator could morph into whatever shape he wanted, but that film had some good, scary scenes. And the end of that Termninator is really good film editing. But I like THIS one, before things got complicated!I know that part of the reason I like this, original one is that my oldest brother loved Arnold and would frequently say ""I'll be back"". And I suppose that's the line everyone remembers. And everyone remembers ""you are terminated"".My brother is no longer with us, but I think about him whenever this film comes on cable.

441,yellowtail_tuna,Schwarzenegger as the 80s iconic unstoppable cyborg,10,6 September 2020,"Arnold Schwarzenegger does look a cyborg from the moment it is teleported naked to the night street. The massive body and the perfectly chiseled face. Who else looks as superhuman as he does? It starts to stroll the streets. Its body movement looks kind of awkward as if the electronic brain is not used to human flesh.While Schwarzenegger, later we learn the Terminator, is the obvious villain, Reese, another man from the future, seems on our side. Both look for the woman whose name is Sarah Connor, former to kill and latter to protect, because she has an important role in their apocalyptic future. I think this is one of the best stories from science fiction action films ever.Sarah and Reese escape, but we are convinced the Terminator will find where they are. And once it finds out, it just advances and catches up with them, destroying whatever in the way. It has no reason to hesitate. So action scenes are always more catastrophic than you expect. It is exciting.Sarah, played by Linda Hamilton, is at first just in a panic with enough reason to be so (of three Sarah Connors in the city, two have been killed).

447,kingtanichi,The birth of a legend,10,11 February 2004,"I have never seen Piranha II: The Spawning, and to be honest it's not high on my priority list. So to my way of thinking, this is James Cameron's real directoral debut. And what an opening it is.To be just, it really shows its obvious budget limitations at times. The calibre of the action is occasionally lethargic and under-edited, which I'd bet meant there wasn't time or money to shoot and edit more aggressively. For most films, that would be it. But The Terminator has enough brains in its scripting and execution that the film as a whole remains a choice offering. The dystopian theme of the merciless future coming back to haunt the unsuspecting past makes this a deserved classic, and Cameron shows are rare budgeting genius as to what he can and cannot show to keep his audience impressed and off-balance (he knows we'll accept the time travel and the future with minimal evidence, but we'll never forgive him if we don't see the robot under there, so that's where he put all the money).What's more, the actors give it a sense of just plain fun. Linda Hamilton may embody the 80s blond toy look at first, but soon shows herself to made of much firmer stuff. Michael Biehn has never received the attention he deserved after this film. He creates a completely different kind of soldier-hero, sensitive and vulnerable, deadly with the agility of a cat rather than channeling John Wayne. In fact, in the greatest of this movie's tricks on its audience, all the traditional macho hero requirements are fulfilled admirably by Arnold Schwarzenegger the killing machine. It makes one wonder about the spirit in which Cameron contributed to that Rambo screenplay.In the final analysis, The Terminator is not to be missed by anyone who presumes to say they enjoy movies. It's a good one.",The Terminator

450,goreilly40,Definitive action movie of the decade,10,1 August 2015,"Very rarely do you ever see an actor who fits a role so perfectly, it becomes almost impossible to imagine anyone else playing it, a few well known examples would be Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks and Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, well I would put Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator right up there, he just fits the role perfectly. His very presence, his movements and his deadpan emotionless mannerisms were in a word, perfect for the character. When he appears you just know somethings going to happen, the depiction of the Terminator's sheer relentlessness and ruthlessness in the pursuit of his mission are borderline frightening. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor turns in a brilliant performance as an ordinary person trying to get by, whose life has suddenly been turned upside down by being thrown into what can only be described as a nightmare situation, likewise Michael Biehn as the war weary soldier still bearing the scars of a troubled if not traumatic past so much so he barely knows what happiness is. The action scenes are probably some of the best I've seen, particularly the final confrontation when you think, ""what more do they have to do to beat this thing?!"". Some of the lines of the dialogue and one line in particular, have since become legend and the most well known in cinematic history. The story is compelling and even thought provoking as to where humanity could end up in the future, even the soundtrack adds to the ominous tension which you feel while watching, especially the title track which like Arnie has become so synonymous with The Terminator that most people would be able to identify immediate which movie its in. This movie will go down as an all time classic definitive action movie, and its a must see for all action movie lovers. I'll finish by describing the ending, the movie's ending is spot on as there isn't the happy ending that most action movies tend to have which can feel like an anti-climax. Oh no this movie ends on an ominous note as Sarah Connor knows the future is far from bright paving the way for the Terminator's return, or as the man himself said, ""I'll be back.""",The Terminator

452,stu9003,Arnold was born to be the Terminator,9,12 February 2001,This is the role Arnold was born to play.  Arnold's ability to project menace and an aura of invincibility are crucial to the success of the film and he doesn't disappoint.  From the moment the Terminator shows up he seems so ruthless and imposing that he literally seems unstoppable. I thought the scene in the disco was a real standout.  This movie was made before Cameron became a star director who could command big budgets and elaborate special effects.  The story and plotting are much tighter and more focused than in any of his other films and the result is a great action movie and Cameron's best work.  Highly recommended.,The Terminator

Although I haven't seen it in many years, I still remember when me and my friends would go to school, tired because we had stayed up all night watching The Terminator.  Then we'd talk about it and everyone loved the movie, especially the idea of the action sequences and the action itself.  This movie isn't for people who like serious movies, which are more acting and drama than action.  The Terminator should be seen by young people, who enjoy action.",The Terminator
455,chilla-black,one of the best ever but still a couple of points to raise,8,14 May 2009,"this is a brilliant film of course, but certain things do occur can put a deeper slant on the plot if you analyse it.Firstly Kyle Reese's arrival in 1984 Los Angeles. We are given the insight in the opening sequences that the world he comes from has become a desolate hell, beyond imagination. So i find it a bit odd that he should not be overawed with the relative comfort of 1984 and suffer a spot of freaking out accordingly, not leg it into a department store and try on a pair of Nike Sneakers. Also some pussy would probably not go a miss either.Then the line that always gets me is the ""Terminator is out there"" speech. OK fair enough but what if the Terminator had killed Sara Connor? What isn't explained is what would the Terminator do until 1997? I like to think he would possibly go on an extended vacation to Acapulco or something.I also find the scenes where Sara's friend is having multiples listening to her Walkman to be a bit superficial as well, especially when she goes into the kitchen and starts drumming with some celery.",The Terminator
456,Progressive-Element,Dark sci-fi classic,10,25 May 2013,"The film that gave Arnie true screen cred, and launched James Cameron's career, this modest-budget sleeper hit from 1984 has become one of the greatest-loved sci-fi films ever, featuring an iconic robotic killing machine, The Terminator.The film makes full use of Arnie's imposing presence, a towering, relentless behemoth who carves a path of destruction, wiping out anyone in his way to assassinate his target - Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton, who is about to learn the fate of mankind, and her destiny to play in it.Like the titular character, this film rarely lets up, only pausing for brief moments when Sarah and her protector, soldier-from-the-future Kyle Reese - Michael Biehn - hide out in a motel away from the city. Much like the bigger-budgeted Aliens, James Cameron shows what he can be capable without mega-million-dollar budgets, getting great mileage out of limited resources. Brief visions of the nuclear-ravaged L.A. of 2029 still look fantastic for their age, a bleak, hellish landscape, where everyone is in constant fear of the roving robotic 'Hunter-Killers', and the Terminators.This first film has a much darker edge than the others, sometimes veering into horror territory with The Terminator a virtually indestructible, literally inhuman foe, though one who still has human organs that have to be dealt with when too damaged - like removing a damaged eyeball for example.",The Terminator
457,epatters-3,2nd best Terminator movie,10,21 May 2008,"The only Terminator movie that is better then this is Terminator 2:Judgement Day. This is more of a action movie then Part 2. It is almost a Horror film. It is a Action/ Sci-Fi/Thriller/Romance. It is my sixth favorite film ever. It is my third favorite time travel flick. Anyone who has never heard of this movie probably has never heard of a lot of movies. If you have not seen it, then I definitely recommend it to you. One guy on here who did not like this film was saying that the terminator does not have any emotions. Of course, he doesn't, He is a cyborg. He cannot have emotions and he also said that the chase scenes were frustrating because the terminator never gets tired. Well, He is programmed to not get tired so he won't stop ever until you are dead. That guy who posted that comment is an idiot. He is the worst critic on here ever. Well, this film is a masterpiece. A great piece from the 80s. I am a big fan of the 80s so I loved this film. MPAA rating:R. Ages 10 and up. Great film because it is very original. It does not rely too much on special effects. Some of the special effects are horrible but who cares? The movie is very realistic.",The Terminator
458,pulikd,Burning.,7,30 November 2020,"An evil being that looks human but is something else, invincible, unstoppable. A killing machine perfectly masked as a human. It is known as the terminator. A selfless human hero ready to give his life for the greater good. His name is Kyle Reese, his body is hardened but scarred and worn. He is no match for the terminator. And a beautiful young woman between these two. Her life is about to change forever. Strangely, if you give it some real thought, ""The Terminator"" is more fairy tale than science fiction. And here's why.Both the hunter and the protector come from the future. That future is off screen. We do have some general images to give us the impression of what it looks like. But the key events that make the whole story happen are deeply hidden.So, an artificial intelligence has been created. And it immediately classifies humanity as a hostile force that needs to be gone. The artificial intelligence, named SkyNet, uses nuclear weapons and humanity is now on the brink of extinction. In a world lain waste, survivors are starving and hiding from special combat machines that patrol the land and the skies. Go watch ""Threads"" and picture what happens if human hunting robots are added at the end of the film where things couldn't get any worse. But there is a man who somehow saves humanity. He organises them and they fight back. They even reach victory. Yes, with nowhere to live and nothing to eat or drink, with radiation sickness all around them, not only do they survive, they become an army that can defeat metal robots that cannot be damaged by casual human weapons. So much so, that SkyNet has to invent and create human shaped robots that can pass for a human in order to infiltrate the human army. But even that does not stop them. They reach victory. But SkyNet has one last card up the sleeve. The time machine. it decides to win by changing the flow of time itself.The enemy is winning because of John Connor. So I'm gonna send a hunter back in time to kill him way back before the whole war. And there will be no resistance! Humans are dead and I win. Except I know extremely little about John Connor. In fact, I know more about his mother. So I'm gonna destroy her before she even gives birth to my enemy.This future is insane and impossible. It is absolutely implausible. If this supercomputer wants us all gone, we will be gone no matter what. With access to all the weapons out there, SkyNet is invincible. Several billions are dead just because of the nuclear attack all over the planet. Others are rotting away. There is no way humans can survive, regain strength in both number and technology in order to rise and reclaim the world with SkyNet defeated. The movie simply wants it to be that way and hides the source of the story.It is a beautiful lie that we like because of what happens on the surface. In our present. That is my point. The one weak spot of this movie is the future. Not just the idea, by the way, the execution as well. Imagine this same move with no future scenes. At least not until the police department massacre. Not until the nightmare Sarah Connor has. But we know about the future from the very beginning. The beginning of the movie is a spoiler. And what if we did not see how exactly they come from the future? Picture that. Two guys after one girl. One wants her dead and, strangely, nothing can stop him. Bullets only slow him down and muscles are no good against him. Is there some bodyarmour? And how about the wounds and the pain? Are there some drugs at work? And what if we didn't see the girl and the other guy have sexual contact? We would not be sure if that guy is John Connor's father!Look, don't get me wrong. I love ""The Terminator"". One of the movies I grew up watching and rewatching. Which is why I have a deep view into it. Which is why I know something. The information we are given in the film is excessive. It ruins the mystery. It should have only one future scene. Sarah's nightmare. We would not be a hundred per cent sure what we saw. Was it a real thing that happened to Kyle? Or was it just a bad dream Sarah happens to have because of the hell she has been through? Uncertainty is a good way to make scary things even scarier.The future is the one part of this movie that is rotting. And any sequels are doomed to be damaged as well. But on the surface of things we have something in return. There is a bad guy and a good guy and there is this woman. And this creates a story well worth it. Dark, well paced, detailed. The practical effects, the robot itself, casting Arnold as the villain was great here. Brad Fiedel's music was phenomenal. The story we have ""in our present"" is very interesting. It's the inner mechanism that does not withstand logical criticism. And it will be a problem when you come to the point where your whole terminator movie has be set in that future.",The Terminator
459,cotandreea,Very good SF thriller,10,13 September 2020,I think it was a very good SF thriller about robots and how they make things happen in our world and what we can do to change perspective in our past or future.

Congrats to all the cast and crew who made this movie happen!,The Terminator
460,annahudak-70828,"A decent, entertaining film",6,14 March 2021,"Going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. All I knew of ""The Terminator"" franchise is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is in it and ""hasta la vista, baby."" What I got was a pleasant surprise. I was surprised that they made me care about the characters as much as they did (don't get me wrong, I was never completely invested in them, just decently invested in them) and that there was never a time I found the dialogue to be cringey. Sarah Conner was a very likeable character that was very easy to root for, you could always tell what she was feeling and thinking, and I wanted her to succeed, I wanted her to live. She wasn't some generic ""damsel-in-distress,"" though she kind of came across that way for a bit in the movie, but she learned to do things on her own as the movie went on, which I'm glad for. The action scenes were well shot and the action was always easy to follow, and it was a very well-paced movie, I never found myself tuning out.Now, there are some problems, such as, I found it hard to completely care about Reese and his mission due to the fact that I feel that they didn't truly portray the direness of the future well, until near the very end of the movie when they show what's basically the slum they all live in. I definitely think that scene should have been at the beginning, to help the viewer truly understand the desperation, the poverty, and the direness of the situation better. As it stood up until then, it just never really clicked. Also, the abundance of what I call ""movie logic,"" where characters continually do the dumbest things possible, like Sarah Conner running up near the fire that she thought the Terminator died in (like, seriously go the other way, don't risk it!) and her crawling instead of getting up on her feet to get away from the Terminator at the very end before she crushed him with the machine.Anyway, in the end, this was a decent action flick. Nothing amazing, but definitely solid. I definitely recommend this movie.",The Terminator
461,mrosesteed,Excellent - a sci-fi/horror classic,9,2 March 2019,"A solid, sci-fi/action/horror film, The Terminator combines tight writing with stylized, noirish cinematography and brutal, if not bloody, violence. Even as it cuts away from moments of potental gore, its effective editing and vivid but not ostentations sound both emphasize the horror and the helplessness of the protagonists' situation. Its memorable score features recognizeable, recurring themes, including the relentless drum beat that signals the monster's unstoppable approach.",The Terminator
462,sjwest,"Um, Excuse, Mr Terminator, Sir. Let Your Head And Your Rifle Move Together To Meet The Target. You Won't Miss So Much  Sorry'.",9,14 March 2004,"Master storyteller James Cameron, brings to the big screen one of its most memorable characters. Although not his original intention for the role, we are all thankful that an agreement was reached to have Arnold play the role of the Terminator rather than the protector, Kyle Reese. This casting proved to be the crucial element that ultimately gave the franchise the ability to continue for many years to come. No disrespect to Lance Henrikson who eventually found a role almost tailor made for him, that of the man with a dubious gift in Millennium'. The movie is also testimony to the art of screenwriting giving us rich characters, an original story and insurmountable obstacles for our heroes.The task of commenting on The Terminator' is hardly a grinding task. Besides the fact that it is such an enjoyable movie, there is not much to complain about in terms of its craft. Many successful movies are a product of having the writer and director as being one and the same. The writer is able to create a visual form of his own text and the end product is his own vision. There would have been few problems here of scenes not adding value to the story or the image not bringing the character fully to life. These skills are not always endowed to the moviemaker, but it is heaped on in Cameron's case.Right from the first scene, we start to realise that this is more than an above average action movie. The inciting scene indeed gives momentum to the story. We see the apocalyptic future and fully grasp the dark, foreboding threat of the machines. The genocidal machines crush the skeletal remains as they advance relentlessly without emotion, doing only want they were programmed to do  wipe out the resistance. The narrator voice has a tone of impending doom thus heightening the sense of tragedy. The story is set in motion for the battle to continue back in time, our time. This phenomenal piece of writing is also included in the tagline. Almost bordering on cheesiness, but it is so well done, it gets away with it.The characters are all of purpose each with defining characteristics that bring the character to life. Sarah Conner is the sweet, innocent waitress battling to cope with life in general. Hardly a sterling foundation for the mother of the future! This does succeed in making her more vulnerable to the Terminator and the vast differences in their character help to set the story of our unwilling heroine against the seemingly indestructible machine. As the character develops and the final confrontation is at hand, she realises her destiny and rises to the challenge. Linda Hamilton is also well cast here, in fact, superbly. She has a look of innocence about her that changes to one of menacing determination, a switch done with believability  a trait necessary for the translation of the character of the story. Indeed her presence was missed in the third movie, no matter how charismatic Arnie is.Then we have Arnold as the Terminator. If ever there was a role suited to an actor, we have the prime example here. Arnold has the name that shouts action. He has a thick Austrian accent that sounds distinctly robotic whenever he uses it. Arnold does not speak much here. He didn't need to since we were all ears whenever a line exited his lips. Remember I'll be back'. His massive frame served to accentuate the indestructible nature of the character. If ever Sarah had a worst nightmare, it would seem a cakewalk next to this guy. In summary, Arnold had all the necessary traits for this character and it has quite rightly become his signature role.Michael Biehn is a regular in a Cameron production and plays the role of Reese very well. We can see that this is a man who has suffered and his determination not only stems from a deep  set hatred of the machines, but from his love for the woman who will be one of the leaders of the resistance. Being slight of frame making him look more like a lean soccer player makes him less of a challenge for the Terminator. In fact, even though he knows he has to ultimately face the machine, the best he can do is run. He always seems to be clawing onto survival and in the end he dies in the final stand against the machine.It would of course be impossible to say that I had satisfactorily completed my comments without a mention of the scene at the police station. This scene is the Terminator's defining scene. It is here that we see him for the cold, heartless, single  minded killer that he is. It all starts with Arnold's most memorable line and then the doors crash in as the Terminator careens into the station with his stolen car. The machine sets about his task with ruthless intent. He shoots anything that gets in his way as he searches for his prime objective. This is all he exists for and it is all he is programmed for. Like personal computers that process its input commands, he follows his input command regardless of all that stand in his way. After all, he is a Terminator so it is as they said in the sequel  nothing personal.The story is uncomplicated, but nonetheless stimulating. Several science fiction concepts are used here, namely, time travel and machine dominance. This blend ensures sufficient obstacles for our heroes and it is also interesting to note that the Mcguffin is not Sarah, but her unborn child. This also creates a sound opening for the second movie that picks up on this in the future where another chase is on, not for the mother but for the young John Conner. The story ensures that the violence is meaningful  a machine programmed to kill would relentlessly pursue its target vanquishing all before it. Nothing to tease the brain, but the craft and intent in the story ensures that the audience is fully engrossed in the movie.      
As man advances with computer technology, the more relevant this story will become. That is why the story was able to continue and audience demand grew. Science fiction takes a known scientific concept and dramatises it. The concept of machine autonomy has now graced our screens in two monster productions  The Terminator' and The Matrix'. The reality of machines in our lives today goes beyond our conscious and ignites our unconscious fears, that is, the fear of losing control of our world and of ourselves. These deep-rooted fears manifest themselves as inspiration for movies such as this. This is not such a bad thing since master storytellers are able to exploit these ancient fears and deliver sublime entertainment that will continue to provide enjoyment across the generations.",The Terminator

464,CinematicGarbage,A Sci-Fi that everyone should see!,7,9 May 2019,"Before being a master of great CGI movies like Avatar (2009), Titanic (1997), James Cameron directed and produced this, Terminator (1984), and it had become one of his greatest work. There was so much sci-fi and action that we have always wanted to see. It was about a seemingly indestructible android is sent from 2029 to 1984 to assassinate a waitress, whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines, while a soldier from that war is sent to protect her at all costs.Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (a name that is hard to pronounce), as T-800. Most of you though that in the movie he would be a protagonist but he was actually the main villain. It was weird right because the poster had his portrait on it, not a hero but a villain. Schwarzenegger was legendary when he took this role and he acted just like a real cyborg with no feelings, no tears, it's just so perfect! Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, T-800's only target, was good as well being a waitress, a person who didn't know how her son was going to be. Michael Biehn played the good guy Kyle Reese, who would then be Sarah Connor's husband but he died before they even got married. Pretty sad! At first I thought he was another terminator which he had no clothes as well as T-800. It was funny when we could see T-800's buttocks. But then, the best performance belongs to the villain and that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was great and perfect for the movie! A great casting choice!I liked the action sequence so much because they were non-stop, entertaining and well-edited, 1% of bad CGI. I just didn't like the cinematography much. It really looked like the 60s with technicolor or the 70s. The 80s were a bit of advanced so they should spend more of the budget to make a better cinematography. It's really hard to look at something that should be seen clearly. Another problem was when T-800 chased the two when it was burnt and exploded by one of Reese's bombs and turned into a cyborg skeleton, it was walking like how villains walk from movies of the 20s, the 30s or the 40s. It was bad. The lines from the screenplay were really good and iconic, especially: I'll be back! Or Fak you assholr! I really wanted to say it in front of bullies who tried to do the same thing that made the character says the line. They would be like ""Where do you get that line from?"" and they would get jealous.Terminator (1984) was a masterpiece of sci-fi and action. I was still confused why it was R-Rated. There wasn't much blood or restricted danger. I felt it should be PG-13 because teens under 18 loved it as well. I really disagreed with the fact that it was rated an R. It was such a waste of that rating. For sci-fi and action movie fans, you guys should see it. It's one of the greatest in science fiction.Ratings: 8.8/10",The Terminator

And I watched the extras and it went over the cut outs and back lighting. They even made it look like they were running over skulls.

469,mikavir,Magnificent,10,13 September 2020,"James Cameron's masterpiece was made in 1984. The Terminator made Schwarzenegger star in Hollywood and at the same his trademark sentence ""I'll be back"" was created. I haven't so much experience about sci-fi movies (Star Wars maybe only exception) so I can't compare this film to other ones.In 2029 there is war between people and machines controlled by AI Skynet. A cyborg named Terminator (Schwarzenegger) comes from future to year 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She will be mother of John Connor, who is a leader of the resistance. The resistance also send their own soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to past. Terminator is very unemotional and brutal assassin. The Plot is very simple. On the other hand it isn't whole truth. There are many other things in the film. The Terminator is very exciting and scary film. A slowly rising tension and creepy music keep you tightly in their grip. Actors are very good. The film raises questions about robotics and nuclear war. There is a tragic romance between Sarah and Reese complementing the film.I don't find weaknesses.

470,ShadySovereign,A true Sci-Fi classic!,10,7 June 2005,"""The Terminator"" was such a big hit when it got to theaters in 1984. ALthough the film's budget was somewhat low, the film managed to earn a lot of respect and attention from fans of the science fiction genre.The movie's storyline is very imaginative. It features a story of time-travel mixed with action elements, and a dose of romance. The special effects were pretty good for its time. The action scenes were very fierce, which can leave the viewers on the edge of their seats. And the romantic chemistry between Michael Biehn's & Linda Hamilton's characters was very believable, and it makes the viewer want to know more about their characters.Most of the film was shot at night, which gives the atmosphere in the movie a more darker feeling. It also helped the film-makers' greatly because the budget was very low.And finally, the Terminator itself is arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role. He fits the role of the musclebound cyborg perfectly. Furthermore, he was very believable as a half-man-half-machine ""bounty hunter"". Plus, he was really scary.Overall, The Terminator is an excellent sci-fi film with a great storyline and great actors & actresses. It is a true Sci-Fi classic that spawned a great sequel and was referenced in many later films. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend that you do so.",The Terminator
471,evandewangga97,The Birth of Machine-Fiction,8,19 February 2015,"This is the first successful debut of Cameron as director. And he did it really nice. I am personally a man of movie taste, that really likes originality as the basic aspect. In this year (2010's), however, there are so many copycats in cinema. The rebirth of idea, is so rotten, that even the visual-effects is brand-new, the story is unpleasantly same. I just can't watch movie like that. Fortunately, I've found the era of idea treasure, it was in 1980's, the new beginning of action and science fiction. ""The Terminator"", is one of the first notable movie that defines its decade. It is somehow full of explosion, but still pay attention in its screenplay. Yeah, I know that the acting is not that good, but just be honest, the robot's acting, good or bad it is always the same. Don't mind the acting from the robot character, at least for this movie. A little awkward act don't break the entire movie, but there are other reasons that make it worth eight out of ten. My general statement for this film is astonishingly creative from the screenplay until the editing, mind the acting.Usually, it's hard to make something new even in the movie, and it is harder to be accepted by the general audience. But, I think it is just came at the exact time. From the time-line of cinema we know that ""Star Wars"" and ""Alien"" have started the trend of science fiction in the late 1970's. But, the firework of this genre is begin in 1980's, when there are so many ""scientific"" creature that starred the movie. From robot, UFO, alien, etc. So do the action-genre, it also began in 1980's, ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"" hit the movie-lovers with not so familiar genre. It can be concluded that ""The Terminator"" came at the right time. When the hype of all the trend is high, it released as one of the science fiction node. Just think, everyone, no matter who, must have been heard about this movie. It's just another effect of the trend. Even until now, they keep airing this movie over and over. Just for introduce the original-sequel of epic fiction.Let's talk about the movie itself. Don't worry, it's still human enough. Of all, the science fiction aspect I just love the future- fairy-tale spoken by future human. And, the unaccepted story by the nowadays human, that's all I mean in that movie. The feeling of being alone in the world, trapped in another world that nobody would care of you. Yeah, that pain only available in story, or in reality if we truly experienced it. The action is so incredible, society realizes another kind of suspense, the fast scene with so many explosion. That's the modern suspense. With the climax in the end of the movie and obvious yet unbeatable enemy, just other classic aspects of ""The Terminator"". In fact, it's the Cameron style to provide such a splendid cinema experience, that I think everyone would sit and watch until the movie is ended. Brilliant directing skill in middle era of cinema.Nevertheless, it is the birth of machine-fiction.

The movie that turned Arnie into an international star and director James Cameron a highly acclaimed director.The story is dark and disturbing.A nuclear holocaust is about to take place and the machines will take over.The only hope for the remaining human resistance against them is the still unborn leader John Connor.His mother Sara doesn't suspect that a machine called Terminator is sent from the future to assassinate her and prevent John's entire existence.To protect Sara the human resistance sends a man named Kyle Reese.But will he succeed against an enemy who seems unstoppable?And so a dangerous game of cat and mouse begins.There is a lot of action,chills but most importantly a great story ,something new and fresh for 1984 when the movie was released.Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn both give amazing performances and the audience feels what they are going through.But the real credit goes to Arnold himself who is absolutely stunning as the mean machine that kills everyone that gets in its way.He gets shot,burned,hit by a truck and blown up but just keeps coming back.A famous scene is when the Terminator goes into the police station after Sara and kills at least 20 cops in the process.One of the greatest things about the movie is the metal endoskeleton of the robot which looks like Death,covered in metal as Cameron describes it.Its totally terrifying and brutal. In conclusion I'll say that this is one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion and a must see whether you like this genre or not.",The Terminator
473,someguy889,It's never left.,8,7 June 2004,"The Terminator is a 1984 movie starring Arnold Schwarzennegar and Linda Hamilton, and it is independent. James Cameron made this before he got the big bucks from Aliens and went on to make Terminator 2: Judgment Day. But to this day I consider this his best movie, because of the independent qualities that it has. Arnold's character has become classic now, and Cameron builds tension and real, actual horror from this creation instead of relying solely on special effects. This movie is called a thriller but should also be called a horror, because the way the Terminator chases Linda Hamilton and Nick Stahl is something to be truly feared, even if he is a robot. This movie is a futuristic allegory, full of meaning, full of thrills. One of cinema's most famous lines is ""I'll be back."" and it is from this movie. But this movie has never left. It's remained and grown stronger, and it will for quite a while.My grade: 9/10",The Terminator

The terminator's job is then to hunt down the mother of the leader, Sarah Connor. But then, sent by John Connor, Kyle Reese. His mission is to protect Sarah from danger.The film is relatively exciting, but somehow i lost the tense and the excitement when i got deeper into the movie. People have been talking about it and said it's really good, so i actually thought i was about to watch a masterpiece.In my opinion, The Terminator is far from a masterpiece, but it's far from bad too. I mean Arnold did some decent acting, but then again he does play a robot. And the movie had 'some' Special FX that would even look good today. When i said 'some' i really mean it. Because most of the Special FX looks pretty lousy today, but i'm not going to judge the movie from that.So to conclude this whole ""review"", if you like. I didn't really feel the movie. I understand completely how it must have been back in '84. But i'm living in a society where the audience demands are pretty high. So with all this concluded i can simply say that Terminator isn't a bad movie, but it isn't that great either. But it gives a pretty good picture of the future i guess.7/10 A good, not great, not excellent, but a good SCI-FI picture...",The Terminator
476,mr composer,Arnie's Best,9,24 June 2003,"It's been a while since I last saw this movie. With T3 coming out soon, which thus far I've no desire to see, it's had me remembering the first two installments of this series. Both are well done, but there are a lot of reasons I prefer this original movie.1. The freshness of it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was relatively unknown (except for Conan the Barbarian fans)as an actor. James Cameron was unknown as a director. Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn were all unknowns. It is a straightforward story with incredible tension.2. Arnold makes a better bad guy than good guy.  This is my biggest reason for preferring the original. Arnold doesn't say much more than a dozen words. Being unknown, he's viewed less as Schwarzenegger playing yet another action role, and more as the character himself - a superstrong, persistent, unstoppable terminator with no conscience.3. The dark tone of the film.  T2 is a load of fun, but it's a blatantly intended summer film. It's choreographed with scenes that just pack it in for the box office. Terminator is anything but this, being sinister and foreboding. It's my impression that this was a nice personal project from Cameron that started this franchise when it had as much success as it did, but even more so when Arnold's box-office status really took off.----------{Spoiler Alert!}------------I have two main drawbacks with this film. The special effects with the bare terminator were probably cutting-edge at the time.  But it looks so much like a cartoon super-imposed in the wide-angle shots.Then there is the paradox of John Connor's conception. It's not enough to diminish the entertainment value of this movie, but this one absurdity stands out since everything else (given a 1984 viewpoint of world history and politics) seems at least possible.  It does make for an entertaining twist to discover Kyle Reese as the father.  But it can't help but rack your brain to think... how can John Connor send Kyle back on this assignment, if he has not yet gone to conceive him?  But I know by now this is a tired argument.  Like I said, it's still highly entertaining, but sticks out as the biggest absurdity---------{END SPOILER ALERT}-------One last interesting note is the inclusion of Franco Columbu as the future terminator, who in real life was one of Arnold's best friends and bodybuilding competitors.",The Terminator
477,Habibi-Universe,"""I'll be back!""",6,9 November 2020,"James Cameron's 'The Terminator' (1984) is one of Cameron's many iconic films. This sci-fi action epic is about a human soldier sent from 2029 to 1984 to stop a seemingly unstoppable cyborg killing machine.'The Terminator' is the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a MEGA movie star!This classic from the '80s offers a very rewarding experience with a great concept for the story!
Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator is absolutely fantastic. He really does look like a robot, excuse me, cyborg and he behaves accordingly! And oh, by the way, ""I'll be back""!Furthermore I totally have to commend the phenomenal visual effects that, to this day, still look fantastic! The make-up department obviously deserves a lot of praise as well for doing such a good job!Unfortunately there are also a couple of problems that I have with this movie!
I really don't like that there had to be a romance squished into this film! It was completely unnecessary and I just didn't buy it whatsoever! What made me even more frustrated was the motivation of our male hero, the reason why he went back in time. Absolutely preposterous!
Another thing I don't like about this film is that killing off the Terminator seems to be ridiculously hard. I'll explain what I mean by that in an example. This film has a typical movie trope that's been in movies since forever! Just when you think a character probably died, nope, he or she comes back to life! And then this character supposedly ""dies again"", but nope, not dead. And guess what, the exact same thing happens... AGAIN! And of course after each supposed death, there is a celebration and a relief. I mean I am sick and tired of this type of storytelling... at least if it is done to this extreme!
Finally I also had some issues with the pacing during a few scenes. Certain scenes were just too slow and really sucked the energy out of the film's flow, but for the most part, the film had pretty decent pacing!Overall, 'The Terminator' is a really fun and entertaining sci-fi action flick with a great villain as well as pure satisfaction for genre fans! 6/10",The Terminator
478,darth_timon,A Legend is Born...,9,18 December 2013,"It's fair to say The Terminator film, made on the comparative cheap, propelled both James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger to the pinnacle of stardom. Not only that, but the film would give rise to a huge franchise.The Terminator is the perfect vehicle for Arnold- his physique lends itself naturally to the role of an unstoppable killing machine, and his movements in this film are robotic and cold. There is not a single sense of mercy from this machine- the Terminator is a creepy, relentless killer.The Terminator is also one of Linda Hamilton's earliest roles and her character of Sarah Connor, the mother of humanity's saviour, is a role she would come to be closely identified with. Her wide-eyed, innocent character has her world shattered, and Hamilton's performance is good. She conveys this perfectly.Michael Biehn plays the desperate, war-weary Kyle Reese, the man sent back in time to somehow protect Sarah from the Terminator. His aggression, his rigid military attitude, slowly gives way to pain and torment- both because of what he's been through and because he falls in love with Sarah, ultimately becoming the father of the very man who sent him back in time.The special effects are great for the time and watching the film today, it still looks good, which is remarkable considering when it was made. There are several stand-out scenes (including where the Terminator rises out of the fire) and the whole film is a fast-paced, gritty, nervy tale, as you wonder how the good guys can possibly destroy the machine chasing them.Things end on a poignant note- the Terminator is destroyed, but Kyle dies. Sarah then has to face the future, knowing that sooner or later, a great storm is coming.",The Terminator
479,ProperCharlie,"Simple idea, perfect realization",8,13 February 2002,"***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD***There's been so much written on the subject of The Terminator, it's difficult to add anything new to the debate.I'm pretty sure that James Cameron stole the plot and premise of this film directly from my nightmares as a small child.  The faceless, huge, unceasing, single-minded, ever-closing thing that used to chase me round my dreams is here on the big screen and he's Arnie.  That is all this film is. A classic nightmare, the Jungian ogre archetype made celluloid.James Cameron has distilled this primal fear perfectly for the screen, the pacing is exquisite.  Even as the credits roll you still expect the Terminator to somehow resurrect itself once more and continue its relentless pursuit.  It has everything that a good horror flick should have, anticipation, genuine fear and timing.  The special effects don't have to be good when you've got film-making as good as this.This film can be seen as the apprentice piece of James Cameron, the first to spotlight his dark and dystopian future visions best summed up in the name of the nightclub in The Terminator; 'Tech Noir'.  This territory is revisited in Aliens, Strange Days, and latterly, Dark Angel. This universe has been inhabited by Ridley Scott among others and perhaps owes something to the Cold War and the nagging fear of nuclear conflict that ran through the 70's and 80's.This film is renowned as being very violent.  It is, however, one of few films where the violence is totally justified by the plot.A must see for anyone who likes film.",The Terminator
480,saymaraza,The Terminator review,10,5 June 2016,"Fantastic film! my favourite film of the 80s along with Robert Zemeckis Back to the future. One of Arnold's first films as a professional Actor, and his most memorable role. With James Cameron directing, this is definitely my favourite film of his by far. Most people think that Terminator 2 is even better than this one. But for me, this beats it every time. I love Terminator 2, but i thought that it dragged out a lot longer than this film. This film was the perfect amount of time for a film to be running without getting boring. And leaves tension all the way. I used to be inspired by The Terminator when i was younger, and I'm pretty sure it was my favourite film at one point. Arnold Schwarzeneggar does such an amazing job as the Terminator, it's unbelievable. I know James Cameron tried to make him look cooler as the guardian in Terminator 2, but in this film to me is as cool as you can get. With supporting acts of Linda Hamilton (Sarah Conner) and Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese) the whole film is a complete blow-out! Schwarzeneggar was perfect for the role of The Terminator, with the size that he is, the one thing i didn't like with Terminator 2, is that he was the half the size he was in the first one. I know it was 7 years after the first one, and he had stopped bodybuilding, but still i think he should have been the same size as in the first one for playing a Terminator. With Terminator 2, it had a clever concept, and is probably the most well though out Terminator movie of them all, with Robert Patric playing a new style of Terminator. I think the first one if slightly better because it was Cameron's original idea for a film, and plus i think if you are playing a Terminator you need to be a considerably big and intimidating size like Arnold was.",The Terminator

Relentless action and well thought out plot and excellent cinematography, and acting help to make this one of the classic violent, sci-fi movies of all time. It is dated in a non bad way on certain effects and with the synthesizer soundtrack; (which i love and think it adds to the atmosphere of the movie, even from the opening credits. Perhaps it is effective because it is machine made and therefore emphasis the emotionless quality behind the Terminator.) Suspense is kept up through the entire movie especially picking up during the dance club scene as you wonder how the Terminator can just keep coming at you. Arnold truly portrayed the Terminator as an emotionless (in a good way) automoton bent on completing the mission at all cost. The actors have wonderful chemistry and were cast well including the psychiatrist and the police officers. It is fun to watch the heroine and hero grow through the movie as other posters have said.

Long before James Cameron donned the sack cloth and started bleating about the environment and making movies like (yuck!) Avatar, he made movies like this and ""True Lies."" ""Terminator"" is an unrelentingly bleak prediction about the future which seems to be coming true day by day as we cede more and more control to computers and those who run them. It's not hard to believe that a Skynet scenario could happen. The basic scenario is, the machines take over and decide to get rid of man. Why not? Arnold is fantastic as the unstoppable killing machine, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are wonderful as the man from the future and the woman he's trying to keep from being killed by the terminator.

T2 is very good, but when I watch The Terminator, and I find myself wanting to memorize five or six lines or even write a book about humanoid machines or time travel, I realize that this one is much more exciting and impressive. Besides, that kid in T2 really annoys me.Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger do a good job, but Michael Biehn is the one who does not get enough credit for this movie. However, he was lucky enough to get the best lines by far. ""That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear; and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!"" That line would be good if only said well, but when Biehn says it, it might be my favorite line of all time; and there are several other great lines in The Terminator.I can't think of one general thing that is bad about this movie. Aside from the afore mentioned dialogue, action, and acting(which includes the actors with smaller parts like Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Earl Boen and Bill Paxton), the plot is brilliant, the music is great, and even the performance and handling of the dogs was impressive!I used to think that Empire Strikes Back was my favorite movie, but since recently watching The Terminator, after not having seen it in years, I'm pretty sure this is my favorite film of all time.Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub",The Terminator

But in this story, he isn't even born yet - machines rule the world in 2029, and are fighting a losing battle against human rebels, led by Connor.  They hatch a plot to send a killing machine back in time, to kill Sarah Connor, John's mother.The human rebels manage to send a human hero back (his name is Kyle Reese), to stop the machine known as ""The Terminator"" - and what follows is a powerful action film, and a poignant love story, as Sarah and her savior fall in love.***In the original casting of the film, the hero's role was supposed to go to Arnold Schwarzenegger, while the ""Terminator"" itself was supposed to be played by Lance Henriksen, an excellent character actor who has appeared in films like ALIEN and THE HUNTED.The Terminator was originally conceived to be more an ""infiltration unit,"" one that would not stand out in common society.  (In fact, reference is made to this in the film itself - Kyle Reese cannot identify the Terminator until it actually attempted to assassinate Sarah.)Cameron and Schwarzenegger eventually decided to put Arnold int othe role of the Terminator, and Michael Biehn was broguht in to play Reese.***Schwarzenegger's greatest successes as a movie star have come in roles where his physical and vocal characteristics are consistent with the character. (Think CONAN, TRUE LIES and TOTAL RECALL.)  Here, he is perfectly cast as a brutal, remorseless, emotion-less killing machine - the straight man in a human drama.Schwarzenegger is chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy, and this roel cemented him as the pre-eminent action star of our time.",The Terminator

The Terminator has become a phenomenon, an embodiment of a ruthless killer and certainly the best robot murdering device from the future I've ever seen.Sarah Conner is understandably upset to learn that a killer cyborg from the future has been sent back to the past (which WAS the present...I think) to kill her so she cannot give birth to the future leader of man against machine. But help is at hand in the form of Kyle Reese, a soldier also sent back to protect her from the terminator.Thinking about it could make your head spin and it probably wont win many awards with Steven Hawkings but as an action film it delivers the goods. Arnold in his best ever role as an unthinking, unfeeling machine - just like in real life - is superb. It was the role he was artificially created to play. He wastes humans with reckless abandon, including a scene where he wipes out an entire police station to get to Connor. A scene so good it was even referenced in the second film.The soundtrack is a huge contributer to the mood of the film and it's the darkest of the three Terminator flicks. Even if the formula was perfected in T2 : Judgement Day the first is still a cinema classic.

It also had Paxton's punk leader dying from being punched through the stomach, rather than being thrown into a fence. He has the claim that he's the only person to be killed by a terminator, a predator and an alien. Did he actually die after being thrown? Probably. The force that the terminator threw him with probably snapped his neck (I think officially, the impact broke his spine).Much of the movie was filmed without location permits.

Her only hope for survival is a human soldier that was also sent back to the past to protect her.You'll love The Terminator if: You want a very good Sci-Fi\Action\Thriller film with good characters that will keep you on the edge of your seat. What I love in The Terminator is that instead of cardboard characters that pose for the camera it has very good realistic characters that get hurt, are always very afraid and very, very vulnerable. Especially Sarah Connor is a real character that changes throughout the film and while Linda Hamilton who portrays her isn't exactly a hottie she shows us that its better to have charisma than a supermodel trying to act, something very common nowdays when it comes to female protagonists. Unlike the sequels the T-800 in this movie is ready to kill you without a second thought. If it grabs you you're dead! If he shoots at you and you aren't covered you're dead! It never stops, it never gets tired and will make you feel the tension of the characters. Finally while The Terminator has some plot holes and logic gaps, (mostly time travel paradoxes), it doesn't offend the intelligence of the viewers.You'll hate The Terminator if: You wanted a more Sci-Fi oriented film rather than an action one or if you wanted something ""louder"" and with a bit of comedy thrown in. The first movie is nothing like T2 or T3 where 2/3's of the movie is all about loud explosions and slightly humorous situations. The chase scenes while very intense are simple they are just chase scenes and not a redecoration of a whole city!!! The Terminator is a way darker film where humor is non-existent when in T2 or T3 you would actually laugh with some of the scenes involving the T-800. Also while the plot is considered Science Fiction there is a greater deal of Action here than actual Sci-Fi stuffFINAL VERDICT: Great Sci-Fi\Action\Thriller\Chase film (7.7/10)[+] Nicely directed. Great Action\Thriller atmosphere. Wonderful acting from Hamilton who portrays a ""real"" evolving character.[-] A bit slow paced at times. Not for ""Hardcore"" Action or Sci-Fi fans.

Yes, the Terminator franchise has more garbage thrown in it than even Cameron thought was possible back in 1984. Yes, Arnie never looked better on screen than when he was playing an emotionless robot. None of that detracts from the masterpiece that is The Terminator though.This was a time when James Cameron was trying to make it in Hollywood. This was a guy who, to make ends meet during filming, would go to Macdonalds with a 2 for 1 voucher, eat one Big Mac that day and save the other Big Mac for the next day. Necessity truly is the mother of invention. Cameron needed to create a masterpiece to solidify his place in Hollywood and in making The Terminator he did just that.Everyone puts in a stellar performance here and though the special effects leave a lot to be desired today it's safe to say that it doesn't detract from the relentless mercilessness of the killing machine that Arnie portrays.

A lot of people argue on which film is better Terminator 1 or Terminator 2, but in my opinion the first Terminator film is the better film. Although Terminator 2 (also 3) were fantastic films with better action scenes and special effects than the first Terminator film, what I prefer about the first Terminator film is the good acting,(especially by Kyle Rees/Michael Biehn) sense of depth and storyline that the other two sequels lacked. What all three Terminator films had in common were that they had elements of Science Fiction and action in them, but what the first Terminator film had that the other sequels didn't have was that it had a romance element. The romantic side of this film is how Kyle Rees travelled back in time to meet Sarah Connor(to save her from the Terminator) and falling in love with one another, while conceiving their son John Connor during their short time together. This film is quite similar to the film 'Somewhere in Time' with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour for that film is also about a man who travels back in time to be with the women he loved.The whole concept of how Kyle Rees was sent back in time from the year 2027 to the year 1984 to save Sarah Connors life from the Terminator and then impregnating her with John Connor (the Future Saviour) is a mind boggling concept. Where does it all begin and end? If Kyle Rees from the future didn't go back in time to the year 1984, John Connor would never have been, but yet it makes absolutely no sense WHATSOVER, that Kyle Rees could be his father considering the peculiar circumstances - however he was his father for unexplainable reasons. The story just goes round and round in circles. In answer to how John Connor was Kyle Rees' son was that the original John Connor from the year 2027 wasn't Kyle Rees' son as he was somebody elses son. When John Connor sent Kyle Rees to the year 1984 to save his mothers life from the Terminator, Kyle Rees accidentally corrupted history by impregnating Sarah Connor with their son John Connor, who of which wasn't the original John Connor. When Sarah Connor found out that she was pregnant with Kyles son, she mistakenly assumed that her unborn child was the saviour John Connor from the future - when he wasn't. The real John Connor would have been a son that she would have had with another man(In a different parallel universe) who of which was never born, for Kyle Rees prevented her from meeting him because he changed history by telling her about the future - as this somehow prevented her from meeting the father of the real future saviour John Connor and bearing him as there son. Thereafter the alternate John Connor who was conceived from Kyle Rees became the new future Saviour only because his mother prepared him for it and because he wanted to live up to his mothers death wish. Its all quite complicated; the whole sequential repetitive cycle of Kyle Rees going back in time to the year 1984 and then another 44 years passes to the year 2027 and then Kyle rees travels back to the year 1984 is a never ending cycle, as its an infinite cycle that goes round and round in circles forever. The first cycle of the original undisrupted John Connor who sent his Sergeant (not father) Kyle Rees to the year 1984, was in fact the only undisrupted future history cycle that happened. However, every other time travel sequence that goes on and on forever in time travel circles that occurred after that original time travel cycle, was in fact the disrupted time travel cycles with the alternate John Connor in a new and changed parallel universe - this is as explained all due to Kyle Rees accidentally altering history. Considering the alternate John Connor took over from the original John Connor who of which got erased from time all due to Kyle Rees, one could say that the original John Connor never even existed - but yet he did! He lives in the lost dimensions/parallel universe of time.As this film is Science fictional, romantic and action based it caters for many types of viewers, whether you're a love-sick girl/ women, a person who is action thirst or just somebody with a good imagination for imaginative people, like myself, do tend to love science fiction films.Anyway, if you haven't seen this film, I strongly suggest you to watch it, for this film is non stop action, has great film atmosphere and had a great and original storyline",The Terminator

496,jonathan45,Sarah Conner...?,8,20 January 2007,"The Terminater: Huge and almost unstoppable, but not just a tank with legs, it uses subterfuge and guerrilla tactics to hunt its enemy down. It has an artificial intelligence that seems both human and machine.Reese: Was raised in a future concentration camp, instead of Nazis they are run by machines and their credo is not to wipe out one race but all races, all organic life. Sarah Conner: mother to a hero, but when we first see her she's just an ordinary twenty year old with no major plans for the future.There are many great scenes in Termniater and a few duff ones, in places the effects look great and in others the budget and technology of the time make scenes look dated. The main theme of the film is technology gone out of control, this was made during the height of the cold war and 'a nuclear error' (to quote Joe Strummer) was on everyones mind. the Termninater is a great screen villain, completely implacable following his grisly programming without an iota of self doubt, truly a 'super soldier'. The cast turn in great performances even the minor roles are well fleshed out, particularly the humorous interplay between the 'seen it all before' detectives. It has a bleak apocalyptic ending with Sarah retreating to the mountains of Mexico to raise John in isolation to fight the future war.",The Terminator

It is scary, it is adventurous, very well done and original. OK, T2 had more and better special effects but it was only action, not so scary. In this movie I think the best scene is the final scene when they get in this factory (or whatever it is) and Terminator's after them. If you haven't watched it, do it immediately.

500,Egg_MacGuffin,Greatest sci-fi/action movie ever?,10,25 March 2005,"I don't know if The Terminator is the best sci-fi/action film ever made by anyone, but if it's not...then I don't know what is.I have seen this movie several dozen times since the age of 4, and it just gets better every time. It does have a special place in my heart, so I'll try and be as objective as possible in my review.The plot is not as complicated as it seems. A man from the future is sent to 1984 Los Angeles to protect the mother of the unborn man who will lead the human race in resistance to the machines, who have also sent back a ""terminator"" to kill this woman, named Sarah Conner.What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. We first see the terminator come back, kill some punks (Bill Paxon is one of them!) rob a gun store, and proceed to kill everyone in the phone book who has the name Sarah Conner. In the meantime, the man is sent back, chased by the police, steals a shotgun and some homeless guy's clothes, and then looks for Sarah Conner. And when we first see Sarah, she is a fumbling waitress...not ""the mother of the future"".When the terminator, the man (named Kyle Reese), and Sarah Conner all come together, we are treated to one of the paramount action scenes of all time. All three people in the same location and the slow-motion and cheesy 80's music starts up. At this point, anyone who is watching the movie for the first time has no idea who's on who's side. Then the terminator targets Sarah and Kyle interrupts the slow motion with gunfire. After that is a short but effective shoot-out (Uzi 9mm absolutely MUST be used in every 80's action movie), then a vehicle chase while Kyle lays down the exposition.The thing that makes this movie so effective is the antagonist...the terminator. He is shot several times, thrown through a window, hit by a car...and he keeps on going. And I'm sure everyone (even some who have not see the movie) knows the famous line ""I'll be back"", which is said just before the terminator ""visits the police station"", if you know what I mean. At this point, Sarah and Kyle are at the police station, so they're safe, right? ""There's thirty cops in this building"", so they must be safe. Wrong. Five minutes later, everyone is dead and the building is burning to the ground...and the terminator keeps on going.James Cameron's directing is outstanding, especially considering the $6,400,000 budget and the primitive yet effective special effects, which deserve special mention. The effects in this movie are, in parts, better than anything that can be done by today's cgi. Sure, there's many parts which are out-dated as hell, but there's still certain effects that look real enough to believe. The gas truck exploding at the end was a miniature actually exploding, not some fake cgi crap done on a computer. The metal terminator skeleton at the end is real, not a cgi effect (but the stop-motion scenes look AWFUL).Considering the budget in relation to what was accomplished in this film, it's truly a remarkable effort that could probably not have been pulled off by anybody other than James Cameron. Add a script that is commonly used as a teaching tool for upcoming screenwriters and you have a spectacular film.The only bad thing about this movie is that after watching it today, it makes you sad that nobody working today can make anything as good.",The Terminator
501,cineastFGD,What a piece of trash,1,15 August 2020,"Really I want my money and time back for this piece of garbage movie. The quality of special effects was below the pain threshold, even by 1984 standards. And don't get me started on the acting. Schwarzenegger's robot performance with a total of maybe 10 lines was probably the most convincing acting in the entire movie. The rest of the cast was wooden to the point of amateurish.And whoever thought of casting Linda Hamilton as the 'beautiful' leading lady, should get their head examined. Not only isn't she particularly pretty, which makes it ridiculous that men would fall for her left and right. But her mannerism, grimacing, constant screaming, weeping, and weak attitude was so provoking I started rooting for the terminator to finish her off in the end. What an absolutely annoying performance of a weak, dumb, and useless female lead. Seriously, how is this movie rated so high.",The Terminator
502,Baghdaddy,Schwarzenegger At His Best!,10,16 January 2014,"Originally, whilst writing the review for Predator, I thought that was Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role, however, one of my favourite actors of all time was at his absolute best in this movie! A must see for any action movie lovers!The film is about a robot sent back through time to kill the mother of John Connor, whom will eventually lead the resistance against the machines in the war following judgement day. The human resistance also sent back a soldier, however, in Kyle Reese, to fight the machine and help protect Sarah, John's mother. Kyle and Sarah must find a way to stop the unstoppable, and this robot will kill everyone and everything in order to complete his machine!The film just basically depicts their fight against the Terminator, which is portrayed amazingly by Arnie and actually I do not believe any actor in the world could have portrayed the cold hearted machine better! There are some truly amazing action scenes here, such as the police station, and the brutality of the Terminator is shown from the start when he destroys a group of punks.",The Terminator
503,behamut,Awesome,10,22 September 1998,"The Terminator, created after another one of James Cameron's reaccuring dreams (Abyss was another one.)  A true beginning in sci-fi movies.  As Schwarzenegger said to his friend when he was picked to play the part as the Terminator, ""they want me to play as some robot from the future in this weird sci-fi movie."" His friend said, ""take it."" Schwarzenegger is perfect as the Terminator, merciless, no fear, no love, no pity, no remorse, no emotions.  None could have pulled it off as well as he did.  Even his eyes showed no emotion with still showing true evil. Michael Beign is just the opposite.  A man sent from the future to stop this machine.  He plays his part as perfect as Schwarzenegger plays his.  A perfect cast of characters for an all star movie! Plenty of action, story line, plot, character interaction, love story, and romance.  Everything is tied into this movie that possibly could be, making it a 3 star movie.  Only drawback is it's a little dragged out at parts and gets slightly boring from time to time but it's so minor that one would have to think about it to care. A truly awesome movie.",The Terminator
504,Rhealist,Still unmatched,9,18 July 2002,"This is one of the movies I enjoy watching over and over again, and the one movie I would love to (to steal a line from the MIB commercial) ""see again for the first time.""  It is amazing that a rookie director was able to make a movie this good.The sequel is technically better, but this one has more heart.",The Terminator
505,Munin75,Genius in so many ways that it's indescribable,10,26 July 2011,"They just don't make movies like this anymore. Terminator, and Alien, sound to the modern ear as some silly summer blockbuster movies, with all the sequels, prequels, cross-overs and whatnot which have downplayed their image. But what many people ignore is that the first two movies of these franchises were pure 80s (approx.) sci-fi gold, and better ; acknowledged masterpieces in general. Even today, The Terminator is original, exciting, scary and pretty damn hardcore from the first scene when the robot encounters the punks, to the succession of cruel massacres perpetrated by the insensitive killing-machine Terminator throughout the movie.It is hard to express just how perfect The Terminator is in terms of plot and character development, and chilling atmosphere, which keeps the spectator clinging to his seat all the way. The opening sequences of the movie ; a brief explanation of the apocalyptic future war, the filthy appearances of the two main antagonists (Terminator and Kyle Reese), contrasted with the simple 80s jolly life of Sarah Connor before hell breaks lose, is a lesson in movie making on how to forcefully grasp the audience's attention and involvement. And when you think you can start relaxing, the booming action starts again even stronger, and greater, until the final act which leaves you gasping for air. This crescendo in suspense and horror is found in a later Cameron film, Aliens, which blatantly bears the director's signature style seen in The Terminator.The special effects were pretty ground-breaking and innovative at the time (something which can apparently be said for almost every Cameron movie since), but what really pulls it off is the incredibly bleak and dirty atmosphere, and of course the great cast. I couldn't possibly imagine other actors than Schwarzenegger, Biehn and Hamilton for the lead roles. All the secondary characters are also fantastic. The Terminator carries a distinct 80s feel to it which I like a lot. I wasn't born when this movie was released, and was brought up mostly on 90s movies, but I must say that the 80s feeling of The Terminator adds to its ""charm"" (if I dare say so). Nonetheless, it has survived the test of time exceptionally well, it doesn't pass as outdated at all - the climax is still genuinely frightening.The fact that Cameron, at the time a newcomer, managed to direct this sci-fi masterpiece, and went on to direct sequels to both Alien and his Terminator which practically equaled if not surpassed the originals in quality, marked Cameron as one of the best new directors of his generation.The Terminator is a perfect 10.",The Terminator
506,KrazzyDJ,A sci-fi tech-noir classic,8,2 May 2015,"This was one of those early movies that drew me in to the world of Hollywood. Of course, when I first watched it, I didn't have much idea about what went behind the scenes when making this movie. But now that I do, my respect for this movie has grown tremendously given what it was able to accomplish on such a low budget with such a small set of characters making what could have easily been a B-movie in the wrong hands seem like a solid sci-fi story ending with an epic feeling of the things to follow.The movie begins with what is possibly one of the coolest title cards for a 1980s flick with Brad Fiedel's iconic Terminator theme playing in the background as the cast is listed in the form of messages displayed from a computer terminal. This is followed by the Terminator and the human making their appearances from the future into our present, gathering clothes and weapons and heading out in their own respective ways in the search for Sarah Connor, a teenage girl part-timing as a waitress upon whose survival rests humanity's future as both she and us learn later. What follows is a cat and mouse game where the human goes all out to protect her and the Terminator is all out to get her and it won't stop, literally right till the end.What separates this movie (and its immediate sequel) from the ""other"" sequels is James Cameron's balancing act who, much like Spielberg, allows the story to take center-stage and drive everything else and has perfect control over the length of sequences, edits, camera cuts and angles. 10 minutes into the movie and you're in, drawn to this world, completely forgetting that the futuristic crafts and landscapes are miniatures with absolutely no chance of being drawn out of this world. While I didn't find the characters to be groundbreaking or as interesting as in other dramas, the plot was extremely well constructed and allowed for some really cool paradoxes that would make for some interesting discussion (would John Conner even exist if he hadn't sent Kyle back in time).The effects deserve special mention too. It is incredible how much Stan Winston's crew and Fantasy II were able to achieve at the time. All the futuristic scenes, the sequence with the Terminator treating his injuries, the chase sequences and the entire ambitious final act all work and some of them still hold up three decades later. And Brad Fiedel's theme gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, as if signaling an impending apocalypse.All the actors do well in their respective roles, particularly Arnold who shines in a part that seemed almost tailor made to suit his acting capabilities. But it is Cameron who is truly the star of this endeavor, believing in his project and driving it to execution. Thank God for the success of this movie, which gave us many more masterpieces by Cameron. But then, it was entirely deserving of it. A sci-fi tech-noir classic.Overall Score: 8.0 / 10.0",The Terminator
507,somersetboy,Thirty Years On I Realise This is 10 out of 10,10,19 July 2015,"Hi. After 30 years and having seen many attempts to recreate the glory of this movie, I now realise how quintessentially sublime and genius this movie is. It not only deserves a full 10 out of 10 but must remain the benchmark of how a movie must excel for the era it released in. I was in school when I saw this and this movie changed me. Similarly movies like Jaws did the same. Very rarely do we come across movies of the calibre of Jaws or The Terminator. I am writing this in 2015, about 31 years after the movie after I realised how culturally and socially significant this movie turned out to be. You may not feel the impact fully if you watch this movie today, but the impact of the story is still present. Anyone keen on watching modern interpretations and sequels MUST watch this first!

509,g_ryder,In the end the Terminator will triumph - that is the real terror of mankind,10,8 July 2012,"The basic plot of the movie is that a highly sophisticated machine (The Terminator) with extraordinary physical powers that also looks like a human on the outside (Schwarzenegger) has been sent from the future to the present so that the machines can terminate the mother of the only person who can save the human species in the final war between humans and machines that rages in the future world. This is being done so that the 'savior of the human species' is never born, and with that done the machines of the future can win easily. The humans of the future come to know of this plan, and so they too send a human into the present time to stop the terminator from carrying out this plan. All the action revolves around this plot, and all the sequences are brilliantly choreographed, along with superb visual effects and dialogs. The role of Schwarzenegger is so perfectly fitting as 'The Terminator', that it is spooky. This has rightly earned him the nickname 'Terminator' of which he too is proud of. It is this spooky feeling that indicates that this is no simple sci-fi action movie, and that there runs beneath the surface theme of man versus machine, a more fundamental theme of life and death, of 'Eros' and 'Thanatos' than just action and adventure, and that is why this is a classic.Coming to the abstract ideas behind the movie, the idea of 'time travel' is now well recognized as purely fictional and therefore serves as an artistic and imaginative prop or support for other ideas. The core abstract idea is that of an ongoing struggle between mankind and the destructive effects of the reckless use of technology, also unleashed by man, which going 'out of control' threatens the entire human species. So this is actually a metaphysical battle taking place within the human mind at the 'collective unconscious' (Jungian term) level. The 'archetypes' of 'savior' and 'terminator' are again props for this battle between those human minds that through their actions and creative expressions support the sustaining force of life, and those human minds that act mechanically and insensitively, and who by their actions support the 'life terminating' or 'death' force.""Our technology has already outstripped our ability to control it."" Gen. Omar Bradley The key fact or the truth that is not apparent is that machines themselves are not players or 'beings' in this struggle, they are not entities that act themselves because they have no 'volition' or 'will' of any kind, rather machines are value neutral tools that are used either to create or to destroy. And since this core abstract idea cannot be presented or explained very explicitly, it has to take the art form of a movie like this one. (Also compare this to The Matrix). Thus 'The Terminator' is a powerful symbol of the ever increasing potential for destruction unleashed by technology that is bound to occur in the future - the event that can only be extended in time ( 'buying time') by the creative use of technology.""Art is a lie that reveals the truth"" said Pablo Picasso. And the truth is that The Terminator will ultimately succeed in wiping out mankind because it is 'designed' or 'fated' to do so. This movie buys some more time for us by it's art.",The Terminator

She is to be the mother of John Connor, humanity's leader in the war against the machines. This man has tremendous courage. He has to go back without weapons or clothing to face a Terminator, so Sarah can live. Arnold is absolutely terrifying as the unstoppable machine. Even though people have been seeing parodies of his portrayel for nearly twenty years, his performance is still powerful. The ending is perfect.

514,brosseauphilippe,James Cameron has created a film that sweats the 80s.,8,2 September 2021,"Sometimes badly aged, sometimes a little better, it is, with the necessary hindsight, a good film, without being a film of genius. The plot, first of all, is quite simplistic, does not have time to get into the movie and points and characters that could have been extensively developed are ultimately almost details or extras, and takes away interests and intelligibility for the film.The characters are not very well developed, we don't really have time to be moved by others but, all that aside, the scenario is original, and is located halfway between thriller and pure science fiction. The theme of machine control, destruction, atomic warfare is very present and bears witness to its time. The acting is pretty good, although Reese is hard to take for anything other than a serial killer, given his looks and expressions. The film is not very original of its time from the point of view of the image and the framing, but no doubt that the special effects must have been formidable for the time. But only for the time. Today the inlays and special effects seem to have aged very badly.The film's atmosphere is gripping and takes on accents of sincerity with the help if small details scattered throughout the film which are really a way of making it better. The music is correct, nothing more, and at the end of the film we don't really remember a general theme that could be emblematic.",The Terminator
515,What92691,"A classic Sci-Fi thriller, that took Science Fiction to a bigger height",10,4 July 2003,"The Terminator is now a days a film that people judge there thrills with. After they've walked out of the theater from seing a thriller, they compare it to this one. The Terminator took the Thriller genre to an even bigger height, the Terminator to Science Fiction to a bigger height, The Terminator took cinema to a bigger height. These kind of movies started out with Alien (when I mean these kind of movies, I mean Science Fiction Thrillers, with a whole bunch of guns, not like Invasion of The Body Snatchers) went to The Thing, and then came The Terminator. The Terminator changed cinema by the stunning special effects, the tremendous plot, and story that can't get better, the creative villian that won't stop till he kills. Also in most Science Fiction films you don't have much romance, in this one you do. This also continued with a woman being the heroe in a Science Fiction film, before Alien (the movie that kind of started for woman being heroes in Science Fiction films)there wasn't a lot. The Terminator also like Alien, kept you guessing till the end, thinking is he going to get killed now, or who will get killed. Other compliments for the film are the acting, which is tremendous, Arnold Schwarzenegger makes you really fell that the villian is really bad, he makes a good job of playing a computer. Linda Hamilton is excellent because she does a great job of being scared. The writing is great, this film created a line that everybody knowes: ""I'll be back,"" one of the most famous lines, right up there with ""Bond, James Bond.""

""Terminator"" manages to be both violent and cerebral, to have enough action and enough intelligence, to have a good premise and a great message.This is THE best of the Terminator movies - despite looking painfully out-of-date in this CGI-dependent age (such as the stop-motion endoskeletons and the damaged Terminator heads), it's still of inconsequence. This movie has a relatively simple story - running from the ultimate killing machine - yet an intricate back story makes it more than just your average chase movie.""Terminator"" is so totally convincing with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) as the lead, in a non-exploitative role so clearly lacking in modern action movies (re: Charlie's Angels). She manages to be a person truly scared by what's going on - namely the Terminator and Reese. For the first part of the movie, it's hard to know who is the scarier.If you haven't already seen it, seek it out.

I have to confess I enjoy T2 Judgment Day as well, but it kind of drags in the middle and the violence isn't as ferocious, partly maybe because John Conner is still a kid then. But in T1, it's a roller coaster, full-blown ride of non-stop action with not a single boring moment, every scene is crucial to the story and the violence is bared for all to see the kind of urgent and desperate situation our heroes are in.Everybody who goes to cinema and not living under the rock all these years will know the storyline in their sleep: Skynet, a computer system, nearly wiped out the entire human population in 1997. It has found a way to send its cyborg- Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, also called the Terminator, back to 1984 to search and terminate the mother of John Conner, who would ultimately lead the human's victory against the machines, before she could give birth. In return, the Resistance sends a warrior, Kyle Reese, to protect her.'The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present. Tonight....'You get to see the bleak, skull-littered future landscape, army of terminators armed with lethal machine guns as their heads swirl and red laser-beamed eyes scour for any Resistance soldiers.'Don't you understand? It can't be bargained with; it can't feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead.' I still get the chills down my spine every time I hear Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) seethes, 'Come with me if you want to live.' As Sarah Connor (Linda Hamiliton) looks on, feeling the impact of the serious danger she is in.Both Kyle and Sarah are tough characters who also brings out the vulnerability as human beings, where most people can relate to, a couple of refugees on the run from a deadly, sophisticated machine programmed to destroy them. They have no other help, only finding strength and comfort in their love for each other, burden from the pressure of carrying the weight of the future on their shoulders.And let's not forget the brilliant killing machine itself- the T800- Arnold Schwarzenegger's most iconic role in his career. He may have only uttered 74 words (including the unforgettable catchy phase: I'll be back) in the entire film, but his presence more than compensates for it. The scene where he self-repairs facing a mirror definitely leaves an impression on me. Plucking out and dropping his human eyeball, with blood dispersing the sink's clear water, is fascinating to see. Then, before you can even hold your breathe, he cuts open his skin as if it is merely made of rubber, and you get to see the complicated endoskeleton underneath.The last climax mounts after Kyle sacrifices himself to save Sarah, but the Terminator isn't dead. So it is man, or woman, versus machine, as she crawls in her injured leg, struggles not only for her life, but for the entire human race. With a 'You are terminated, f**ker,' it is crushed to a lump of scrap metal. The nightmare is over, for now. And you just know that there's got to be a sequence, because this is one cyborg/machine/terminator that no one will ever get tired of.The Terminator succeeds and excels in action, horror, romance, adventure and in every way any science fiction fan could possibly ask for. And it will definitely remain as one of my most favorite movies of all time.",The Terminator
523,bonepilot,A Classic that will continue grow,9,12 July 2011,"I recently saw ""The Terminator"" on a movie channel after at least a 10 year hiatus. I'm happy to report that James Cameron's plot,and direction, and the gritty acting by Schwarzenegger, Hamilton and Biehn have NOT faded on the screen after all these years. Despite improvements in CGI, etc., the mesmerizing force of the titanium endoskeleton wrapped in synthetic tissue still causes the sci-fi fanatic in me to rejoice! It is also refreshing to see that no film has touched upon the idea of sending an agent back in time to destroy the creator of the future as well as this film does. Not only did this film come off as a huge success, but the following two sequels fell into place in a satisfying way. I can see that this film will continue to grow in its cult status over the years, based on its simplicity, thrills and suspense, and sheer action value. I've GOT to get the entire collection of all three films someday, so I won't have to ""stumble"" upon it by chance on a movie channel.",The Terminator
524,baza666,ONE of the best films EVER!!! (may include spoilers),10,19 August 2001,"I think the title says it all. I think this is one of the best films ever made. Its certainly Arnies best movie.  The plot has several loopholes in it, but if you ignore them and just watch the film then you will enjoy it. The best scene in it must be when Arnie destroys the police station looking for Sarah.  The thing that I prefer about this one instead of T2 is that the chances were more on the evil side in this one. In this one the good guy is a human were as the ""baddie"" is a robot, but in T2 both sides are machines, although one is more advanced. You must see this film.",The Terminator
525,dave_wlogan,"Dark, demonic and deadly",9,21 July 2008,"This is the most groundbreaking action film of all time. Dirty Harry and Die Hard deserve some credit but this is just phenomenal. The exposition is great. The story develops quickly and each character is different. Unlike most action films we aren't given a character who goes nowhere, Sarah Connor (Hamilton) develops into the strong woman we see in the second film during the course of this film. The T-101 is acted well by Schwarzenegger, and before you say anyone can act like a robot know this; Schwarzenegger came up with most of the ways the T-101 moved. When he is searching for Kyle Reese (Biehn) and Sarah he moves his eyes and then his head giving him the resemblance of a surveillance camera. It's little things like that which gives his performance a little bit of extra weight. Michael Biehn is believable as Kyle Reese and takes the part very seriously and it paid off for the film. The special effects are excellent for such a low budget film and the dark look adds to the intensity that the film already carries. The music isn't typical Hollywood either it is always complimenting the danger the characters are facing. This is a fantastic film, a must see movie for everyone. Only one flaw and which is that in one scene the stop-motion isn't very good, but other than that perfect.",The Terminator
526,the-timelord-victorious,A massive accomplishment!,9,26 June 2012,"The Terminator is a perfect example of what James Cameron can do with a limited budget, and when he's not relying on special effects. There's lovely bits of character development littered through it as well, not in your face back story, just stuff that make the characters a bit more human (well bar Arnie obviously). I think what makes it such a great film is the fact that it doesn't rely on massive special effects to make it good. They really do play a back seat role, and the fact that it's just a really simple narrative makes it work very well. It's more of a violent game of cat and mouse, with a massively overshadowing sense of no hope. The plot is well thought out, and the characters are very believable. There's no doubt in my mind that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a terrible, terrible actor, but the thing about him in the Terminator series is that you just don't care. The main reason being is that he's playing a cyborg, and isn't supposed to show any emotion. I think what this film managed to do very well, which I think lacked in all the other films, is the genuinely chilling atmosphere. I think the soundtrack plays a really big part in this, it sounds like a violent, orchestrated game boy soundtrack. There's something just so fitting about it.I really love Judgement Day, and find it the best in the series, for the mere fact that it feels a lot more entertaining, and even though it's a massive blockbuster movie, Cameron (before he got bad) managed to perfectly balance action and drama. The first one however, I think is a massive accomplishment and I part of me loves just how independent it looks. It was made with a budget of 6 million, and I really do feel that more movies today would benefit from having a really stripped back budget, just so they can concentrate on character development and atmosphere rather than shooting and explosions and putting everything on the screen with SFX.",The Terminator
527,Clockwork_Orange55,"""""The Terminator"" is James Cameron's earliest masterpiece.""",9,11 October 2015,"The whole story of the 'Terminator' franchise never makes any good sense. If I were to judge it in that angle, then ""The Terminator"" would be a failure. But cut that. Never had before that I thought a story is the most vital element of a movie. ""Terminator"" is a ballsy, undividedly original 1980s sci-fi action picture. James Cameron's ingenuity, open doors for his outstanding far stretched imaginations for storytelling. Cameron's gifted mind, brought a story that is so fresh and entertaining, into the cinematic legends.Into the future. Nuclear holocaust strikes, and an artificial intelligence known as Skynet rises up. It deems humanity as a threat and its goal is to wipe out the whole of humanity. Briefly, there is a war between the survivors of the nuclear catastrophe and the machines. A cyborg assassin a.k.a. Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), is being sent by Skynet to back in time to eliminate the mother of the leader of the resistance force, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). If the plan is successful, the formation of the resistance force will be halted and fate altered. But to avoid it from happening, a soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is being sent to be Sarah's protector. ""Terminator"" is obviously a 'Cat & Mouse' story, where the Terminator will only stop living if Sarah is killed.""Terminator"" exhilarates with so much energy that all scenes, and all moments, were only being captured for the fullest. There are no hollow spaces in the film, and nothing declines. It is the sharp and skillful editing that set it to be a piece of bold, entertaining action flick. To put it simply, ""Terminator"" is a show for great filmmaking. Its performances are proper – Arnold Schwarzenegger is intimidating as the killing machine cyborg and Linda Hamilton excels as the struggled heroine. The supporting casts are solid too, especially from Paul Winfeld and Earl Boen.It is funny that a woman who does nothing but waitressing is being targeted for extermination. If the Terminator had not been sent, and Kyle Reese never visits that timeline, John Connor, son of Sarah Connor, would not exist. Sarah Connor is a story of a woman who seems scared, weak and incompetent but eventually turns out to be the opposite of her normal self. And Linda Hamilton played her wonderfully well. If there is a message in the movie, it would be Sarah Connor herself. She gives the idea of a person who goes from zero to the unlikely hero, and who ultimately becomes a vital figure would prevent the future apocalypse.""The Terminator"" is James Cameron's earliest masterpiece. Only after years later, he presented the world with several great movies like ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"" and the sequel of this. And too he gave us the two highest grossing movies of all time just for decades later: ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"". He, in the present day, has cemented himself as one of the greatest filmmakers. His contributions like his extraordinary visions for cinema, and his will to entertain audiences, are rarely matched. His ""Terminator"" might just be the start of that fire.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) twitter: @Alex_DeSmall",The Terminator
528,grintemcstinger,Visionary,10,12 May 2015,"More than 30 years has passed since ""The Terminator"" has been released. Wow, how time flies by... Still, the movie remains one of the most fascinating pieces of cinema history. It may show its age in some parts, where it's ""so 80's"" and goofy you'll probably have to giggle or roll your eyes and Arnold delivers his few lines with an accent thicker than pudding, but beside these minor scenes, it has aged well and truly reminds me that they don't make them like that anymore. And if you haven't seen it - what are you waiting for? Stop reading anything about it, go grab yourself a copy, turn the lights down and the sound up and enjoy this visionary masterpiece.Why do I say is it visionary? Because there hasn't quite been anything like it before, not at this level of production. Just the idea that a near indestructible cyborg is haunting you for seemingly no reason is nightmare inducing, fundamentally great movie material. Not only that, but how James Cameron is expanding on it is sheer brilliance. Of course, since it involves sci-fi babble which you may or may not find far-fetched there is a slight chance you'll find it's plot to be nonsense. Regardless even if you dismiss the story as something completely stupid there is still plenty of impressive action, stunt-work, car chase-thrills and tension to keep you entertained. But it's far from being just mindless action. It is dark, it doesn't scare away to show some nasty stuff such as the Terminator repairing himself with this flesh torn or him going on a spree at the police station all of which cleverly emphasizes what an unstoppable, ruthless force we're dealing here with. Speaking of the scene at the police station, it is probably one of the most spectacular shootout scenes ever. The non-stop sounds of gunfire, smart use of POV shots which at the time were something creative and not overused, clear camera angles and uncompromised outcome make it something truly special. And Arnolds performance in it is pure badassery. The Terminator is one of those must-see movies. Even now where it's formula has already been copied countless times, I still can't appreciate it enough. It is a product of one of the greatest filmmaker of our time, which earned its success by pure passion for the material, imagination and vision, and it shows. Truly a masterpiece.",The Terminator

Well directed, beautiful scenes, especially those set in the future. Cool time travel storyline, and I normally despise time travel. Turned Linda Hamilton into a star.

Well, Terminator wasn't as good as I remember it, but it does have its moments.  First of all, sometimes it was very obvious that they used a puppet face for Arnold.  Second, Linda Hamilton sucked.  She just went around saying ""Omigod, omigod, omigod."" Arnold (I'm more used to seeing him as a good guy) just didn't have it. Michael Biehn was the highlight of the movie.  That guy should've been famous.  Anyways, it clearly shows signs of date, but it is still pretty good.",The Terminator
532,Kyle Reese,My favourite movie of all time,10,12 May 2001,"The Terminator is my favourite movie of all time, it has everything I look for in a film, action, love, an excellent music score, an excellent cast, including my favourite actor Michael Biehn. I love everything about this film, in it's day, nothing had ever been seen like it, and is still highly entertaining today. When thinking about the films relatively modest budget, what was achieved was amazing. Although the model of Schwarzenegger is not as impressive as the one used in the sequel, it can be tolerated and is an extremely small flaw in a fantastic film. The car chases, gun-battles and explosions are nicely interluded by an intriguing plot and a love story. The Terminator is so much more than just an action films, it explores many issues and successfully brings them all to our screens.      The best character is Kyle Reese, portrayed by Michael Biehn, in the role that launched his career. Reese is the best hero character of any, and Biehn is highly entertaining in every scene he appears in. It is isn't every day that a viewer will have a film character to be his idol, but Reese is simply cool and the kind of guy every teenager wishes they could grow up to be. The humor in the film comes from the police characters of Traxler and Vukovich, portrayed admirably by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen. They are a perfect combination in the film and every scene they appear in is enjoyable. They're deleted scenes on the new DVD are a must. Henriksen was a Cameron regular, appearing in Piranha II, and later in ALIENS, along with Michael Biehn as well. The brilliant Bill Paxton also makes a cameo here and he would go on to be Cameron's most used actor to date. The Terminator has it all and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.",The Terminator

It makes you feel scared and sad at the same time. The best out of all The Terminator movies. And one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a movie for everyone!

536,nathanhmcdonald,Super Action Sci/Fy Thriller....But also the most romantic love story of the 20th century?,10,6 October 2011,"I was once asked while on a date with a girl...What I thought the most romantic movie of the 20th century was. I paused, thought about it for a minute as I wanted to give a genuine answer. And ultimately I concluded that it was The Terminator, and this is why...(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD) The Terminator tells a story of a man who travels across the endless wake of time on a whim to battle against an unstoppable cyborg and protect a girl whom he only knows by the old faded picture he was given of her. Ultimately the unsung hero of this movie is a man named Kyle Reese, Kyle was raised in the aftermath of a nuclear war against the most advanced computer ever created by man, all of which took place prior to his conception. He is a man who knows nothing but war as this become radially apparent throughout his character development.Sara Conner is the woman he is sent to save. The reason she has been marked for death is because unbeknownst to her she is the future mother of the man who leads us to destroy the machines and win the war against them man years in the future. Kyle is tasked with traveling 45 years back in time to 1984 to save Sara Conner from an extremely hostile cyborg assassin. Ultimately this movie takes place over only a weekend, but during this weekend many things happen, from a nightclub gun battle between our hero and the cyborg to a police station massacre at the hands of The Terminator, To the ever sentimental night of lovemaking spent together by Kyle and Sara, and a final battle between Kyle and The Terminator in an Industrial Warehouse, in which our hero Kyle Reese is sadly killed by either shrapnel to the face or a broken neck either of which could have been received during a last ditch effort to kill The Terminator by use of a homemade pipe bomb.Some people might laugh at the idea of The Terminator as a romance movie...But to me couldn't be more obvious. Man travels through time to save woman AND conceive the future savior of the world with. And ultimately give his life to protect the one he has fallen in love with.In a delightful moment at the end of the movie...A young hispanic boy snaps a quick photograph of Sara Conner as she sitting in her Jeep at a gas station. Upon looking at the picture taken of her we see that it is the picture Kyle will ultimately end up with in the future. In an earlier reference in the movie Kyle says that he always wondered what Sara was thinking about when that picture of her was taken...Ironically she was thinking about Kyle. 10/10...Movie's don't get much better than this.",The Terminator

When I thought of the time that this man comes to the real word, I could help feeling fearful. However, this happening is never occurred in this world, so I could enjoy watching the film.

One more thing I was surprised to see is that there are some grotesque scenes in the film.

541,andrejakc-1,"Best ever sci-fi movie till now, the original and the BEST.",10,21 May 2006,"There is simply no flaw in this movie. From casting, to direction to the great script. Arnie was born to do this role. Michael was a perfect hero and James was the only to pull it out, by his standards. Arnie had a very small amount of lines but more-less all of them are memorable. From ""i'll be back"" to his multiply options of answers while repairing his face damage. Even Reese's one-liners like ""Come with me if u want 2 live"" are legendary. And our main hero dies. I mean in how many movies nowadays this happen? I was always against any syrupy happy-endings but this one is just about perfect. What about that picture at the end? The beginnings of this masterpiece might be in some other classics like ""Blade runner"" or ""Mad Max"", than Cameron definitely borrowed from ""Westworld"", but somehow he managed to create his own space. There are countless books written about it and there will always be a debate which one is better T1 or T2? For me personally after more than 10000 movies seen there are just a few with 10 points. Terminator is one of them.Star Wars, Matrix and Alien come up to the near second in sci-fi section but ""I'll be back!"" rules. Still after more than 20 years it is not dated or outlived. It still has the visual flair, ""that accent"" and just a great story. Made on low budget it became one of the most influential movies of 80's, and 4 me it is the original and best ever sci-fi movie 'till now.",The Terminator
542,PhilipJames1980,The ultimate blend of Orwell and action,9,25 February 2005,"Even in this post-Matrix era, this movie is still the ultimate blend of Orwell and action. If the definition of a classic is a movie that's often imitated but never equaled, then The Terminator is definitely a classic, because the increasing redundancy of its sequels and imitations merely demonstrates how good the original is.I wasn't fortunate enough to see this movie in the year of its release, the year predicted by Orwell's classic novel as a time when technology would be used to enslave people, but I did see it in about 1992, when the blockbuster success of the first sequel made me curious to watch the first film. At that time I preferred the second Terminator movie for being technically superior, but after all these years I now prefer the first film's raw intensity and kinetic energy.The Terminator was of course the breakthrough movie for James Cameron, and even after Aliens and Titanic it's still arguably his best-directed film. I challenge anybody to watch this movie and point out one single shot that needs improvement, because the direction of this movie is so fluid and precise that I can't think of one moment in the whole 100-minute running time that I would want to change.Cameron was and of course still is a notorious perfectionist who's very difficult to work with, but his perfectionism really paid off with this movie because it can be watched again and again without losing its entertainment value. He's a master of the small touch, as when the cop at the desk is filling out his paperwork with a small pencil and pauses in mid-sentence to look up and see the headlights coming towards him through the doors.Cameron also co-wrote the story, so this movie meant even more to him personally than merely a directing triumph. Supposedly he drew his inspiration from a nightmare in which he was being chased by a humanoid with one glowing red eye, and indeed the whole film has the urgent, oppressive atmosphere and calm logic characteristic of a nightmare. But of course he was probably also remembering subconsciously a couple episodes of The Outer Limits that he saw as a kid, which explains why he had to acknowledge the writer Ellison in the credits.Besides Cameron, this movie really belongs to the three lead actors. Arnold of course gives the performance of his career in this movie, but then so do Linda and Michael. Arnold's physical presence and harsh accent have never been put to better use in a movie, while Linda never had another role that required her to run through such a full range of emotions--sweetness and vulnerability, toughness and despair, etc.Michael has always been a B actor, but since The Terminator is essentially a B movie he fits in perfectly. His performance proves that an action hero is much more compelling when he's vulnerable not only to physical pain but emotional difficulties, to which his big, haunted eyes are put to good use. Watch him in this movie, as a man thrown out of his time but with a mission, and you'll see a perfect match of actor and character.In a typical action film, the amount of violence and bloodshed in The Terminator would be excessive, but in a movie about an unstoppable killing machine the envelope can be pushed. In one of the more memorable set-pieces, the Terminator takes on an entire police station full of thirty cops, and although I didn't exactly count them the viewer gets the sense of watching every single cop being gunned down.Ordinarily I wouldn't describe such a scene of slaughter as ""cool,"" and yet there is some-thing undeniably cool about Arnold, with his sunglasses and leather jacket, going through the station with a shotgun and assault rifle and taking on everybody. Arnold's charisma helps the audience stomach the cold-blooded determination of the Terminator, but also the character's single-mindedness invites admiration: even as we're appalled by all the killing, we have to admit he does it rather well.This movie has more than enough gunfire, explosions and stunt-work (including some especially good stunt driving) to work purely as an action picture, but it's the film's anti-technology paranoia that makes it more than just an exciting ride. Notice, for example, the subtle role that Sarah's answering machine plays in the story: the cops can't get into touch with her because of it, while the message she leaves on it brings the Terminator right to her.In one memorable shot, the tracks of a construction crane become those of a killing machine in the future, crushing an endless row of skulls, which you can interpret any number of ways (is it a crack against urban renewal?). Also note that the criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper, and that even in the post-apocalyptic future in which machines have destroyed the world children still huddle around a television set in a desperate effort to be entertained.Some viewers may be turned off by this movie's preaching, but one quality that distinguishes The Terminator from its countless imitations is the strength of its convictions. Too many science-fiction/action movies fail under the weight of their own camp, but The Terminator is an exception because it actually has the nerve to take itself seriously. The bickering between seasoned cops Paul and Lance provides some levity, but at no point does the film make fun of itself.The only reason I'm not giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is, after all, The Terminator, and not Casablanca. If people still remember it in forty years, then I'll give it a 10.",The Terminator
543,ian_bell,The other Six Million Dollar Man!,10,9 June 2010,"$100million or more may have been spent to make the much celebrated sequel, but this, the original, stays longest in my mind, and I suspect a good many other people's too.For all the hype about T2, that film simply does not have the narrative drive which is on show here. Fusing the concept of time travel with the theme of assassination, James Cameron's picture has echoes of such classics as Day of the Jackal; the extra twist here of course is that the Terminator would appear to be indestructible. It's as though Steve Austin (TV's Bionic Man) had transformed into Mr Hyde.By creating a tightly written thriller, with an almost claustrophobic sense of tension to it, Cameron proved right at the start of his career he does not need a mega budget to make a great film. Indeed, it's significant to note that the two finest pictures of Cameron's career, critically at least, The Terminator and Aliens, are also the two films with the smallest budgets.T2, Titanic and Avatar have reaped over $4 billion, but hand on heart, can anyone honestly claim those pictures, in regard to writing, direction, and a compelling storyline come anywhere close to the tension and sense of drama which he manages to evoke here in less than a couple of hours?

This is refreshing in this day and age, and the film carries it off perfectly.Most of the reasons for its derision are unfair.First reason: ""It is low budget, consequently with bad special effects"". Personally, I like the special effects. I like stop motion animation. I like good model work-and the model work is exceptional.Second reason: ""Not enough action scenes."" There are less action scenes than T2, I admit. But T2 seems to hinge on action scenes, which are hugely overblown and excessive. T1 has one great centrepiece-the police station massacre. This action scene is simple, unpretentious, and utterly utterly spellbinding.Third reason: ""It is very 80s, and looks dated"". It is dated, yes, but this does not work against it in the way that it does for, say, ""The Lost Boys"". It features ordinary people of that period-not EVERYONE wore excessively ridiculous clothes and styles. Also, the music is actually very good. I am not a fan of 80s music, but this is actually great-the Terminator theme song here is better than anywhere else-mournful and haunting, not melodramatically orchestral like in T2.Special mention #1 mention must go to the scenes set in the future. These are brilliant, oozing with atmosphere. In T2 the human fighters are a tightly regimented band of marines running around in uniforms. Here they are dressed in rags, living in holes in the ground, and eating rats. The effect is startling and scary, and the grainy nature of the picture works well.Special mention #2 goes to Arnold Schwarzenegger. His performance is fantastic, and is what makes the film so great. His utter lack of emotion is the key; in the sequels the Terminators occasionally showed flashes of emotion, to their detriment, but here he is totally inhuman. This purist approach, which includes giving him only a handful of lines, actually makes the one hint of him being something other than a monster (when he smooths down his hair) work well.His lines are excellent, and not at all cheesy-even the infamous ""I'll be back."" When this was written it was not a cheesy catchphrase, just another line that works well in the context of the scene-and it shows. It BECAME cheesy when it was used in every film Scwarzenegger made over the next fifteen years.I hope when you see it you recognise that almost all of the criticism levelled against it is unfair. If you have a piece of criticism that you think it deserves, let me know.P.S, It sounds like I don't like T2. I like it very much, but it gains more praise than perhaps it deserves compared to the original.",The Terminator
545,rajveerdhanak,A low-budget start to a high-budget franchise,8,27 January 2020,"After years of procrastinating on starting the series, I finally got around to watching 'The Terminator' - a relatively low-budget film that spawned a series of high-budget films, which I plan to watch in chronology. Not to mention how this film had very successfully launched the directorial career of James Cameron and solidified Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career.'The Terminator' follows Kyle Reese, a human soldier tasked to stop an indestructible cyborg killing machine - both sent from 2029 - from executing a young woman, whose unborn son is the key to humanity's future salvation.It becomes clear from the basic structure and narrative elements of the film that Cameron was inspired by horror-slasher films like 'Halloween' and the dystopian sci-fi films of that era such as 'Escape from New York' and 'Mad Max', as the similarity becomes more apparent with time.Though the world-building and mythos-creation of the film is excellent, the plotline is quite predictable, emotional moments feel forced and contrived for the plot, and the 80's cheesiness is apparent through the dialogues and performances. Even the romance subplot feels sudden and contrived for the sake of establishing the predestined fate of the movie's plot.Personally, the story of how this film came to be is more interesting than the actual film - and I don't mean that as a detriment to the film's quality. The noticeable prosthetics and dated visual effects that may hamper the initial viewing experience eventually becomes more fascinating once you find out the amount of hard-work, rejections and creative problem-solving it took to make this sci-fi film in the 80s - an era that hadn't yet developed visual effects as we now take for granted.",The Terminator
546,hatsunemiku-27340,Does the Future Hold Up?,5,11 September 2017,"Candid admission time: despite selling myself as a fan of action cinema there are two classic genre films I've neglected my whole life. Predator is one, and The Terminator is another. Recently because of this blog I decided to watch both in the hopes of giving a fresh review from a new perspective. Alas, I couldn't finish Predator. I didn't think it was particularly entertaining in the action department, I cared little for the characters, the Predator itself was threatening but not enough for me to be glued. I considered it more a slasher film with buff men in lieu of stupid teens.The Terminator falls into the same boat in a way. It's a horror film more so than action, a kind of slasher/chase movie where we follow our heroes in their escape from the monster. Unlike Predator which hides the creature from us, The Terminator focuses on the cyborg hit-man and makes sure we know what he looks like and how daunting he can be.Sarah Connor is a waitress in Los Angeles when her life is shattered by the appearance of two men from the future, one a resistance fighter, another a Terminator, a cybernetic organism. The future is bleak with nuclear holocaust caused by the rise of the machines sending humans underground. With the machines ruling, a resistance fighter named John Connor has become a hero, throwing a monkey wrench into the inorganic creatures plans. Facing defeat thanks to this man, the machines send a Terminator into the past to eliminate Connor's mother and reset the timeline. Somehow one of the resistance managed to go through as well to protect Sarah Connor.Despite the futuristic ideas and plot the movie itself is very light science fiction and operates more in the horror genre. Sarah Connor is completely unprepared for what she is about to face and Arnie's Terminator is like Friday the 13ths Jason, an unstoppable brute who is seemingly unkillable. It makes for some compelling sequences of destructive action, the Terminator shooting up a police station being a particular highlight.As this is a site dedicated to action critique, I'd be remiss not to mention the editing making many action sequences quite awkward. The very first series of murders has the Terminator kill a trio of punks. What could have been a quick and effective assault is a jankily edited nightmare that hardly makes sense. As the movie progresses, I found the editing got increasingly better but overall it's another case of overediting ruining the effectiveness of action.Another reason I wasn't as enthralled by the action as others is my disdain for what I call ""Industrial Action"". These movies are typically dark, ugly affairs that focus on abandoned places and industrial areas for settings. Cannon Films was a constant perpetrator of making films that felt inorganic purely because of the settings. Cobra is a prime example and even a film like Robocop, which I do quite enjoy, comes across as bland and uninteresting because of the setting. All of these films take place in metropolitan areas but nothing feels lived in or real. Even in Terminator, the chase sequences aren't as compelling as they could be purely because of how staged it all seems. I don't care how late at night it is, there would be a lot more cars on the streets than the movie portrays. It pulls me out of the action.The other facets of The Terminator are just as artificial in my eyes. The plot is interesting as a concept but goes nowhere interesting. I'm sure T2 will expand upon the mythology built up in this first outing, but as a stand alone product The Terminator doesn't invest me in the film's world. The stakes feel nonexistent because Sarah Connor is so removed from the future war against the machines and there isn't enough of a connection thematically. We see the war and its effects, but they aren't tied into the events of 1984 enough.What ties the past and future together is Kyle, the resistance fighter protecting Sarah. The problem here is that Kyle is a weak character and the romance that buds between himself and Sarah is poorly executed and extremely two-dimensional. Sarah, for her part, has some character development but she doesn't exactly feel well-rounded and isn't interesting either. When the artificial killing machine antagonist is the most compelling character in your film, you're missing the point.I don't have a lot to say about The Terminator because I didn't feel it provided me with anything to really talk about. And that's the sign, to me, of an average film. I don't think The Terminator is bad but I do think it's two-dimensional and lacking in a lot of departments. I mentioned with Speed that you can turn your brain off and enjoy it. That was a fast paced, dumb action movie though. This is trying to have a little more gravitas and meat on the bones and I really do not think it works.",The Terminator
547,Drew-36,The original Arnold action flick!,8,21 March 1999,"A good film to watch every now and then to see how a film made with a miniscule amount of money can end up looking like a big-budget extravaganza. It was the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger famous, and also put ace director James Cameron on the map. It is surprisingly fresh to watch 15 years later, and most notable are some good effects, and excellent stop-motion animation that must have required a heck of a lot of work. However, it is obvious that this film alludes to many other works.",The Terminator
548,cousinoleg,Under a sci-fi action movie lies a prophetic Christian-inspired message,8,5 July 2015,"As a Christian I'll try by God's help to uncover the spiritual meaning and influences of this movie, including the causes of its popularity and enduring factor.I watched it more than 20 years ago, even before really believing in God and His Son and my Lord Jesus Christ.At first sight Terminator seems to be a typical late 70s-early 80s action/horror movie, which were mostly based during the night, like early John Carpenter's movies Halloween, Attack on Precinct 13 and Escape from New York, which adds to the fear factor, as having a seemingly unstoppable and almost silent villain, who seems to represent pure evil, barely stopped by a final girl.The cause might be rooted in the global politic and economical crisis which was occurring then, lack of resources, large unemployment, rise of crime, as well as fear of nuclear war.The difference is that Terminator offers a solution to these fears, a savior figure who could deliver the humanity even from the case of the worst – a nuclear holocaust.The main source of inspiration for Terminator is actually Christian faith and the Bible, which already predicted a future Judgement day, great tribulation, as well the Savior in Son of God Jesus Christ.I think it is by God's help that this movie was made, even in Hollywood industry, a money-making business; but nobody likes pure materialism, hence it is the spiritual subtext acts as a parable, assuring its popularity, despite increasing apostasy from Christian faith and worldliness.As God and Lord Jesus Christ said: ""Therefore speak I to them in parables: because seeing they see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."" (Matthew 13:13)Sarah Connor a young woman, a to be mother of the future savior, John Connor. The names seem inspired from Sarah wife of Abraham, who miraculously by God's help bore Isaac in her old age, as Bible says ""Through your descendant all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me"" and name of Jesus Christ with initials JC, led to Sarah and John Connor (JC).It is shown that in the future an artificial intelligence called Skynet attempted to destroy all humanity by starting a nuclear war and extermination of humans in death camps.However humans led by John Connor managed to defeat it, so to prevent its destruction it built a time machine and sent a killer cyborg into the past, called the terminator, to kill the mother of the unborn John Connor, Sarah.Terminator acts like king Herod, who ordered killing of all children from Bethlehem to kill also the king of Israel and Messiah Jesus Christ, attempting to kill all women called Sarah Connor.The terminator seems to be influenced by earlier movie robot types such as evil clone of Maria from 1920s Metropolis, also with deep Christian influences.Having no shame, no guilt, no fear, no mercy, acting like a beast, not a human, he seems to be inspired by image of the beast from the book of Revelation ""And he (beast of earth) had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.."" (Revelation 13:5-6)In this lies conviction of those who are human in appearance only, but are like beasts in their action, lacking love, care, goodness which come only from God, who makes us human.To protect Sarah Connor, her son John sends one of his soldiers Kyle Reese, as was mentioned in one internet article, acting as both angel Gabriel and Holy Spirit of God, telling Sarah about her future son and conceiving him in her.In this is the paradox enacted, the son acts like his own father, by sending his real father to save him and conceive him from his mother. It is close to the Christian faith notion of trinity, where God is altogether Father, Son and Holy Spirit, as humans made in his image are composed of mind, body and spirit, yet are one being.After a long round of chases, Sarah and Kyle manage to damage and burn the flesh of the cyborg, as was prophesied: ""And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."" (Revelation 19:20)By the last remaining bomb, the terminator is badly damaged, crawling without feet, Kyle is killed and Sarah badly injured, unable to walk too. Finally she manages to crush it under a press, reminding me the Genesis prophecy from God about serpent aka Satan's fight against humans and being destroyed by a hit to the head:""And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life: And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."" (Genesis 3:14-15)Thus i thank God and Lord Jesus Christ for giving me wisdom to uncover it as an apocalyptic tale of struggle between Satan and Jesus Christ who will win and will lead his people to the promised land, God's Kingdom of Heaven.",The Terminator
549,ochoamanuel21,A Masterpiece,10,30 March 2010,"This movie is every bit as good as the second one in its own rights, first of all it does not feel outdated since the movie is set in the 1980s so it fits and the future flashbacks are awesome- Kyle Reese is awesome too and also and in my opinion this T-850 is more relentless than the T-1000 since he does not hesitate in the kills- the T-1000 is still awesome and sleeker but the T-850 is more threatening in this movie. This film is violent, grim, and with a glimmer of hope with Reese and Connor, the way is supposed to be. Not to mention Brad Fiedel's metallic score matches the film perfectly as a Tech-Noir film. Sarah's evolution from a lowly waitress to the mother of the leader of the human resistance is believable.

552,Velociraptor256,"Dark, fascinating and pretty much brilliant",8,5 September 2010,"James Cameron's first full stint as a director, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's first time in his most famous role, is still definitely a worthwhile watch, though not without its flaws. Thanks to its cinematography and particularly good soundtrack, this movie has a great atmosphere, dark and frightening and not for the faint-hearted. The action scenes are good for the 1980s at least, but some of the special effects for the Terminator look a bit dated these days: for example, in one scene, the use of an obvious animatronic head that doesn't even really look like Arnold.While it's occasionally slow, the story is well-written and generally gripping, backed up well by the actors: Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are excellent as the human heroes, but of course it's Arnold who steals the show as the Terminator, bringing real menace to it simply by his presence and expressions, since he doesn't have much dialogue in this film.The Terminator is definitely a film to check out - and if you enjoy it, make sure you find time for the sequel too.",The Terminator

If you were to watch the movie, you would never know it. The things that James Cameron was able to do with such a limited budget is nothing short of remarkable.

Highly recommended for Sci-Fi fans. My rating 8.8 on a scale of 10.",The Terminator
556,coneill97,Schwarzenegger Shines in James Cameron's Breakout Film,7,14 October 2019,"What makes The Terminator work so well is the simplicity of its story, which is told so effectively. It has a straightforward and engaging narrative that is easy to follow for the audience. Given the fact that this is a science fiction story that deals with time travel, credit must be given to the well-written script from James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd.The main cast in this movie does a great job and bring their characters to life. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a terrific performance as the titular character, creating one of cinemas most iconic villains. His complete lack of reasoning or empathy makes him terrifying. Michael Biehn is very likeable in the role of Kyle Reese and gives it his all, while Linda Hamilton is solid in the role of Sarah Connor. Paul Winfield and Lance Hendrickson are also memorable in their small parts as a lieutenant and detective, respectively.The movie includes some fantastic action sequences, including a shootout in a police station and most notably, a sequence which takes place in the Tech Noir nightclub, where the tension soars to fantastic heights. The action throughout the movie is gripping and violent with Brad Feidal's iconic score taking them to the next level. Feidal's music is epic and emotional when it needs to be while also evoking a sense of dread whenever the T-800 is on screen.Despite its low budget, the film does a good job with the special effects, in particular, the few scenes that are set in the future. The T-800's prosthetic arm and the cyborg skeleton design are also magnificent. Some effects haven't dated as well as others, however. An animatronic head is used in a small number of scenes after the T-800 injures his eye, which never looks convincing and takes the viewer out of the movie.The final action sequence in the factory doesn't have the same edge of your seat excitement as the rest of the film. This is down to the use of stop motion effects which feel jarring compared to the gritty, realistic style of the rest of the movie.The weakest element of the film is the love story between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. It never feels convincing or believable, given that the characters have only known each other for a single day. The sex scene between the two characters is also incredibly awkward, with the camerawork and editing making it feel like an 80's music video.Overall, The Terminator is a great, fast-paced action movie. It put James Cameron on the map and gave Arnie his career-defining role. While it isn't perfect, it's essential viewing for fans of science fiction cinema.",The Terminator
557,Tom16uk,100% classic stuff.,9,20 December 2004,"The Terminator has everything - action, romance, slight humour and a brilliant storyline. The reason the story line is so good, is because unlike a lot of films these days, this film could become a reality. The idea of machines and computers taking over our world is a definite possibility, as they will indeed become cleverer than us. (fact)But getting back to the film, the special effects are what most caught my eye. Indeed, by todays standards using stop motion animation (plasticine models moved one frame at a time) is dated, but I feel this made the film seem scarier some how. Just seeing the T-101 's endoskeleton walking down the corridor at the cyberdyne factory sends shivers down my spine, because the animation looks so scary - a brilliant piece of directing by James Cameron. This is were Terminator 3 failed, because the CGI (computer generated images) just isn't scary. One things for sure, you can't beat hand produced special effects, and Stan Winston has done a stunning job. in both T1 and T2.Of course, this film has some great acting in it as well. Micheal Biehn does a good job of not being able to adapt to 1984. What I like is the good choice of actors. Neither the character Kyle Reese or Sarah Connor are absolute superstars that have glamorous looks, and thats why Cameron chose them. He made us see how the character of Sarah Connor could have happened to any one. (providing they have an unborn son, as you'll see in the film)And as Sarah keeps asking herself in the film ""why me?"" Cameron doesn't need to unravel an answer, but suggests that she is just a normal citizen, who has been given this terrible ordeal. But in kyle Reese's (Micheal Biehn) eye, she is very important.Cameron uses some good directing techniques, especially with the music. The theme tune has a simple electronic style to it, but it stays in you head for ages! But for a low budget movie, music composer Brad Fiedel does a great job, mixing tension, with classic piano music in the scene were Sarah and kyle spend a bit of time 'in bed'. The piano music immediately reminded me of the piano music used in Titanic. So it seems Cameron hasn't lost his touch for music.By the 2 disc special edition DVD to get extra features, including commentary, trailers, 'the making of T1' and some deleted scenes, which I have been puzzled why there were deleted. One shows some FBI or special agents removing the terminators main chip right at the end, and slips it inot his pocket, explaining how it got to the cyberdyne factory in T2.You really can't fault this film.

The Terminator. This movie is one of the best. It is action paced and it actually works as a love story.SO! on to the main review. The main characters of this movie are Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn). They are pretty good characters and the actors just make it better. Kyle is kickass and Sarah is also awesome especially near the end. The main villain, of course all of you should know this by now, is The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). He is AWESOME! He doesn't have a personality but you can sort of get one OUT OF A FRICKIN ROBOT! He's just awesome that way. The supporting characters are basically the police lieutenant (Paul Winfield) and while he's on screen, he does a pretty good job! The action is just amazing. It kept you watching and the suspense could cut you like a knife. And finally, the story is actually kinda complicated but still good. A war in the future forces the robots to send a terminator to destroy the mother of their best fighter, John Connor. John then sends Kyle to protect his mother. Then the rest is running for a Arnoldinator. But it's more complicated than that which this is my only gripe. The story has what is popularly known as the Connor Paradox. If Kyle Reese is the father of John Connor since he made love to Sarah, then how was John able to send Kyle if he hadn't even existed? Was his father a different person before he sent Kyle and he thought Kyle was cooler so he sent him to be his father? MY HEAD! the story is my only gripe.

More a sci fi action thriller than its horror film plot suggests. Arnold is made for the role of a killer cyborg and his lines are kept to a bare minimum to give him as much menace as possible. Linda Hamilton plays the damsel in distress against type and Michael Biehn is good as a damaged hero from the future. Mention should also go to Lance Henrikson and Paul Winfield who do a wonderful double act as the cops investigating the Terminator's killing spree.It's a testament to Cameron and the work of Stan Winston that this film looks like a big budget film rather than the $6m it actually cost.

The action scenes are exciting, but it would have been better to have it more science fiction and less action as we only see a small part of the film focusing on the future.

570,thedanny-10831,Very good sci-fi movie,7,16 March 2021,This first movie of Terminator's saga is pure gold and remains one of the scariest movies ever made in the sci-fi genre; it's an horror movie without being an horror movie. James Cameron hit the target at the start of his career. This movie has a big series of special and practical effects which are very peculiar for an 80s movie and the story is very interesting and engaging.,The Terminator

This classic film was ground-breaking and genre changing, with exceptional special effects for its time.1984 doesn't realise it's on the brink of a troublesome IT system apocalypse and are not prepared for the Terminator's arrival, or the fantastically baffling time travel thriller that follows.The casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator was inspired, at the time he was unknown as an actor but an Austrian bodybuilding beast of a man, whose size added to the intimidating Terminator persona.Just go with it and enjoy this dark sci-fi spectacle.",The Terminator

573,beermonsteruk,The Godather of Sci fi Movies,10,18 December 2019,"Wow, this is one of them films I try and watch once a year, it's that good, a true classic, many film lovers I know agree with me and I usually always see someone's face light up when mentioning this classic (as well the excellent sequel T2)On the surface, cyborg comes back from the future to kill a woman to stop her unborn child ever being born, sounds like a B-Movie script right?? If so, then this has gotta be the best B-Movie in history (and I absolutely love B-Movies) this film is more than any one genre, Sci-Fi, B-Movie, thriller, horror , this film has it all, even some romance thrown in, the point is it's one of the best films of its kind, one of my all time favourites.
We get a glimpse of a nightmarish future where machines rule the world and then back in (present day) 1984 LA, two men (one man, one cyborg) are transported onto the LA streets both looking for a carefree young Sarah Connor, one wants to protect her, the other wants to Terminate her so the machines can continue to rule in the future and her unborn son seems to be the key to stopping them, definitely a mouthful of a plot to keep up with, so we have a cat and mouse game going as her would be killer is an unstoppable Cyborg, a T-800.The tension is present throughout pretty much the whole film, the film also screams 1980s in the best possible way, the dark brooding neo noir atmosphere, the music, the lighting, the tech-noir nightclub, theirs barely no time to rest, their is tension, drama, action right from the get go to the thrilling climax.The cast are fantastic here, Michael Biehn as a young soldier sent to protect Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, but the real star of the show is Arnie himself, a career defining role in an impressive film career of action packed hits, but none better is he here, a truly terrifying machine who will stop at nothing.James Cameron done a brilliant job with this and the direct sequel T2, but for me the original edges it due to the sheer bleakness of the plot, the films set mostly at night and I recommend watching it in the evening believe me it is not the same watching in the daytime.
Some critics say as with all films of a certain age that its dated, special effects not good compared to today, etc etc, forget all that and just enjoy the film, immerse yourself fully and pretend your in 1984 and the films just come out.
I'm hoping to watch this again soon, as it's such a personal favourite, so get the beers and some food in, and enjoy the ride, an easy 10/10.",The Terminator
574,Morpheus-76,The most relentless film ever made!,10,31 October 1999,"This marked as Arnold´s and Cameron´s rise to stardom and was also a landmark in action and sci-fi films. Although the Terminator had a small budget, it´s still visually perfect and captivating. As for the acting, Arnold does what he does best and he does it well (he´s very convincing as a cyborg) although many would claim it´s not acting...  But the best thing about this film is it´s relentlessness; it´s totally merciless and humourless as it drives towards one of the best end-fights ever made. Music serves an important part in convincing the viewer of the sheer unstoppable evil of the Terminator who never rests. A total masterpiece which endures repeat viewings from year to year!",The Terminator
575,Ned_And_Shall_Luvz_Filmzsh,A classic!,7,30 March 2020,This film is legendary.Arny places terminatort perfectly and you can't help smile whilst watching the intense scenes of the terminator chasing Sarah Jane and Connor.A film full of twists and turns whilst leaving you with a nice little suprise at the end.Wicked.,The Terminator
576,perttu_hartikainen,"This film is, no doubt, in the group of 10 best movies in history.",9,17 November 2007,"I simply loved this clip. It has a bit from every movie genre, horror, romance, action, even comedy. Arnold Schwarzenegger's fate was to play the role of The Terminator, the unstoppable machine with an ability to erase everything between him and his target.Terminator goes back through time from the year 2029 to the middle of the 80's. His mission is to kill Sarah Connor, the upcoming mother of mankind's only hope, John Connor. Arnold's acting is perfect, everything from the robotic movements to the experienced handling of fire-arms. The scene where he makes a killing spree in the police station with a machine gun in the other hand, and a shotgun in the other is bad ass! That is my favorite scene in the movie, and one of my favorite scenes in the movie history.The human resistance sends a soldier named Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah. Later we find out that Kyle's only mission was not just to protect her, but to become the father of John Connor. This unique plot turn makes our minds go crazy from thinking all this, John sends his own father back through time to ""make"" him.In the end Kyle blows up The Terminator, unfortunately not surviving from the explosion. But the machine isn't dead yet! Finally Sarah destroys it with a hydraulic compressor and soon is taken to the hospital.In Terminator 2: Judgment Day we find out that after driving down the highway in the end of the previous movie Sarah tried to blow up the computer factory responsible from the nuclear war.My opinion: Excellent story, excellent actors/acting, and excellent action scenes with mind-blowing gun-fights; definitely an amazing movie! 9/10 points.",The Terminator
577,Jollycox,He's a Machine!,8,8 November 2002,"Arnold does a great job in this movie and so Do the supporting actors. This movie has a great plot and is one of the few Sci-Fi movies I really dig. This movie has action, love, suspense, and thrills all balled up into one Terminator Movie. You cant go wrong with this movie. The only thing I didnt like is the Special Effects. I am positive they were advanced for the 80's but as I watch them now I can tell how fake they are. Great movie still.",The Terminator
578,jameslipski,One Hell of a Thrill Ride!,10,6 February 2011,"So I am watching this movie right now on AMC and it took me back to when I originally saw it. I was in college in 1984 and I went to see this film with a good friend of mine. It grabbed my attention from the opening credits and would not let me go!I had seen Arnold in a few movies so he was familiar. His performance was perfect. The adorable Linda Hamilton is terrific as the scared ""mother of the future"". The story is creepy because 26 years after it opened the concept of a machine man is believable. When this movie ended I walked out of the theater exhausted. Very few movies have had that effect on me. I have watched this film maybe 30 times and never gotten bored. Highly recommended for viewing.",The Terminator

He is very strong and crazy, so people can't fight against him. Some women are killed by him, and one lady is being target of him even she does nothing. However, he targets on her for a reason.This story is very thrilling, but has some emotional parts. I like the way to show that the strange man is very strong. He is in good shape, and also doesn't smile at all. Arnold Schwarzenegger played the part of the strong man. He makes the man more thrilling by his appearance. However, the content is a little bit complicated for me, especially, the relationships among people. You might enjoy this movie more if you got information before you watch it.

I have watched this film many times and still love it, still feel the tension in the situation, the terror.Its just about perfect. the acting is great, michael biehn especially. The bad guy is bad, there's no mercy in there. Like many Cameron films, the dialogue brings out real characters, and the relationship between the Sarah and kyle feels genuine. The way the film unfolds is constantly gripping. The soundtrack really emphasises the desperate struggle.And most of all the whole movie does justice to the plot, and the plot is absolutely watertight. Like the best science fiction films, it leaves you thinking about it, it leaves you agog at the possibility of it, and it doesn't have any holes - the downfall of Terminator 2 in my opinion, which doesn't make any sense from a plot point of view given Terminator.10 out of 10 - the effects may date but they don't make a movie.

584,S-Runner,One of the greatest movies to come out of Hollywood.,8,6 July 1999,"And will probably not be accepted in today's harshing-by-the-minute counter-violence standards. It tells the story of a Terminator coming from 2029 to kill the Sarah Connor, mother of John Conner, the leader of the resistance to prevent him from ever being born. The resistance also sends someone through time to protect Sarah and a hunt ensues across LA.This movie is a straight action with a little love story that develops between Kyle, the protector, and Sarah, the protectee. It involves a lot of shooting, killing, maiming and ferocious and disgustingly beautiful scenes (The one where the Terminator fixes his hand and eye using scalpel).It has almost no element of drama, feeling and very little humor so I don't really know why I liked it, but I did. This movie is not for everyone, it should only be viewed by the action-freaks, disgust-lovers and the mature in mind with absolutley nothing to do.That's about it, too bad I can't get any good quotes out of this movie, all of the best ones are from the sequel, so go see that one too.",The Terminator
585,jayman_30339,The holy grail of Sci-fi horror.,10,5 December 2001,"IMHO, you can't do much better than the Terminator.  It is sci-fi horror at its finest.  This movie introduces us to one of the best villains ever seen next to Darth Vader himself.  Anyone who prefers the kinder, gentler Terminator over the monster that Arnold portrays here is a person with quite different tastes than mine.  Watching that cyborg calmly slicing his damaged eye out and impersonating Sara's Mom are chilling sights that you won't soon forget!  Arnold absolutely makes this movie what it is, it's true that he was born to play this role, although all others involved are excellent. Most people of course think of the ""I'll be back"" line, which has become Arnold's catch phrase, and has become rather tired.  Not here.  The things that the Terminator says ARE often funny, but not in a yuck-yuck one liner type of way.  The key is that the Terminator is not trying to be funny at all!  He SEEMS funny because he simply makes demands or states facts, which is not the way real humans interact.  So we laugh when the Terminator says, ""I'll be back"", not in a ""Arnolds bein' funny"" way, but in a nervous, ""what's the heck is he talking about?"" way.  He truly appears to have no soul at all, and gives the performance of a lifetime. So for those who like Arnold's newer, funnier movies, be warned- don't expect anything pleasant here. There is no kid, no happy ending, no ""everything will be all right"" message. The Terminator is very bleak, very scary, very dark, and not for everyone by any means.  But if you like sci-fi horror movies this is the holy grail and may never be topped.P.S. -I don't know much about guns, but listen carefully to what the Terminator tries to order in the gun shop early in the film.  Also notice that he stares downward while talking in this scene because he's reading the list off his eyeballs.  Great attention to detail, great stuff!!",The Terminator

590,Gotensive,One of the best movies ever,10,2 November 2008,"This movie is so great that I can't even begin to comprehend as to why it's not rated higher here on IMDb. It's a dark, gritty, relentlessly entertaining Sci-Fi Horror movie that features terrific performances all-around, a chilling score, and Arnold as the unstoppable villain. The special effects were very impressive for it's time, especially considering the budget. This movie has so many memorable & creepy scenes like the police station shoot-out, the scene where The Terminator is repairing his eye and arm, hell the beginning where he kills the punk teenagers is creepy as hell, especially upon first viewing since you have no idea what it actually is.

James Cameron abilities to create unique stories about a certain subject is amazing. The action and practical effects look sick. The characters are charismatic, Kyle Reese, although it seems like a Marty Sue, has a traumatic past that could get a movie. Sarah Connor should be the role model for every girl, not like Captain Marvel. Arnold (T-800) is the in my top 10 favorite villains. The development of the story is seamless, you think that this would be like people would actually react. My favorite scene is the one in the police station. Is really good.

597,jameskinsman,Ever Increasing in significance,9,15 December 2005,"The Terminator, now over 20 years old, is a genre defining film that combines elements of noir film making with science fiction and action genres. It started off a whole movement in special effects and stunt orientated films, taking the hero against villain notion to a whole new level. Can you think of a film villain quite so iconic as the terminator? Often dismissed by many as a simple action movie responsible for launching Arnold Schwarzeneggers career, The Terminator has a message that is becoming more significant as we venture further into the 21st century.Since the creation of planet earth, time has seen the inception of ever increasing forms of intelligent life. The principle of the natural selection and the very nature of existence, is that evolution progresses though natural processes of refining, developing and enhancing. Humans have for centuries been the dominant, most intelligent species on earth. As we continually create and innovate, probing technological possibilities, we are weakening the significance and purpose of natural selection and are playing the role of god increasingly. Computers become more advanced every year and scientists endeavour to pioneer methods in cloning and designer babies. Are we pushing too far, or are we simply approaching a new age of evolutionary development? Whatever our destiny, the line distinguishing computers and A.I, and possibly more importantly, humans and computers is becoming increasingly blurred. If we are indeed heading towards the creation of artificial intelligence, is the dark and apocalyptic vision created by Cameron just a nightmare, or does it present a possible future? A question as frightening as the looming Terminator in the movie.The Terminator I believe, is one of cinemas modern classics and in 20 years time will be admired and revered as one of the great films of the 20th century. Not only does it have a powerful message, forcing us to ask questions about our increasing dependence on machines, but it also influenced a whole load of films in the late 80's, 90's and into the millennium.",The Terminator
598,eskwarczynski,"The effects may be dated, but the story is timeless.",8,21 March 2016,"Although this film has been almost completely overshadowed by it's vastly superior and instantly classic sequel, Terminator deserves a place among the greatest sci-fi action films of all time. What James Cameron was able to accomplish with a measly six million dollar budget is absolutely incredible. The style of the film is easily comparable to Halloween, the horror classic which released six years earlier. An unstoppable antagonist chasing down an initially weak protagonist. This game of cat and mouse is thrilling, and would be perfected by Cameron in Terminator 2.The film has some flaws, most typical of lower budget and independent fare. The score is primarily synthesizer sounds. Performances range from good to bad – Linda Hamilton certainly developed as an actress in a big way by her 1992 return to the franchise. Effects are a fifty/fifty between jaw-dropping and cringe-inducing, although it should be noted that Stan Winston's designs are incredible in every case.Overall, this is a wonderful film with a few minor issues, and should be seen by anyone who considers themselves a fan of the genre.",The Terminator
599,blisterpeanuts,Still holds up over 30 years later,9,11 June 2016,"I just re-watched this movie; the last time I saw it was approximately 1987. For a 1984 production, this is superb science fiction. The Terminator, like Blade Runner, represents the best of the early '80s and even today has not really been surpassed despite decades of advances in CGI, digital processing, etc.The Terminator robot behaves more or less as one might expect. James Cameron is intelligent enough not to ruin the movie by anthropomorphizing the robot, in other words making it display emotions and behave too humanly. It's a computer created by computers, and acts accordingly. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at his physical peak and did a superb job conveying the sheer evil that this machine represents.Sarah and Kyle were well played. She was an ""average girl"" working at a busy family restaurant and dating mediocre guys in her spare time. We watch her grow into the strong soldier that she must become to defeat not only the Terminator but to raise a revolutionary hero who will save humanity.Kyle came across as a soldier who is very good at his profession, but has little exposure to the finer things, having grown up in a horrible post-apocalyptic world. He finally softens and opens up to Sarah, sparking a love affair that is heartbreakingly brief.You can enjoy the Terminator and simply ignore the fact that there are sequels. #2 is not bad, but quite superfluous and contradictory to the first movie in which it was made clear that ""no one goes home, and no one else comes through"" the time machine which was smashed by the humans. The first movie is an epic story and needs no sequels. But #2 is fun if you must see a little more Arnold-as-robot.",The Terminator
600,adammfeeley,Game changer for the genre,9,4 June 2015,"I had heard good things about this movie and I believe good dosen't do the film justice. The story line is so original and it has the perfect blend of action and story. It focuses on Sarah Connor, a woman who will give birth to the future resistance leader of the human race, as she is hunted by a robotic cyborg who has been sent from the future to kill her. She is also protected by a human called Reese who has also been sent from the future. The story is so unique and all the actors are amazing. The fight and action sequences are perfectly shot. Despite some people saying the CGI would be laughable but for the time it was released it was groundbreaking. The standout is Arnold Schawzneger who shines as the tough, emotionless cyborg. I love this movie and it is a standout of the science fiction genre.",The Terminator
601,nickyjohnp,"""I'll Be Back""",8,28 October 2017,"Before The Terminator, James Cameron wasn't to well known as he had previously done Piranha 2: The Spawning, which received negative reviews from critics and audiences. But that led him to The Terminator, it started off as he was having a dream about being chased by a killer cyborg while he was on directing the Piranha sequel although he'd been bed ridden because he got sick from the food poisoning. Arnold Schwarzenegger was known as a body builder not really an actor. Originally Schwarzenegger wanted to play Kyle Reese the man sent from the future to protect Sarah Conner. But it ultimately went to Michael Biehn. This is for the best as Schwarzenegger's terminated is known now to be one of the best movie villain's of all times. James Cameron originally plan was to only have one movie but the success critically and commercially led to four sequels (one of which he directs). The visual effect's for the movie are amazing as for the time of the initial release no one had ever seen anything like it making James Cameron a legitimate filmmaker in Hollywood. The acting is strong and is easy to follow, the ending of the movie is what you wouldn't expect leaving you with hope. If you thought this is another low-budget crappy sci-fi thriller you'd be wrong as this movie launched James Cameron's career, Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton's and with Bill Paxton's cameo. With James Cameron's direction the film is what it is today a classic that never get's old.",The Terminator

The next day I watched Titanic, as excellent as ever. Then I thought about watching other James Cameron films. He s definitely a genius and while waiting for Avatar 2, I watched The Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The basic idea of the film is that in the future most of humanity has been wiped out by machines. A brave man named John leads the human resistance against the machines. Machines are nearly wiped out, when they send the Terminator, an almost unstoppable cyborg back in time with one goal:murder Sarah , the future mother of John. By doing so, humans would already be wiped out. However, a human called Kyle Reese is also transported back in time to save Sarah. The film is great and I enjoyed it.",The Terminator
603,Rurextrexx34,Original and Still the Best,9,23 May 2020,"This movie has so many good action scenes, my favorite being the police massacre scene because it shows just how cold and relentless the Terminator is in pursuit of something it wants.This is definitely Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role yet. He has yet been able to top it off. His performance in T2 was alright but it wasn't typical Schwarzenegger. Michael Biehn probably gives his best performance here also. His role in Aliens was pretty awesome, too. He did take a turn in The Abyss by playing a bad guy. Linda Hamilton, an extremely underused actress plays probably her most convincing role of her career. Her performance in T2 was great, but it's sad that she won't be appearing in the T3.One final note about the Special Edition DVD. The many special features it has like the ""Terminated"" scenes and stuff is cool, but the sound quality of the remastered version is poor. The reason why I probably hate the remastered version so much is probably because I'm used to watching an old unmastered version of the movie that my dad taped off of Cinemax or HBO or something like that",The Terminator

It's the kind of movie you have to watch for the first time back in the day to truly appreciate it, as kids or even adults watching it for the first time today would probably see it as just low budget and tacky if they have been introduced to the series with the likes terminator 3.The Terminator & T2 Judgement Day, will remain in my top 20 list until the day i die, most movies don't come close to there sheer greatness.10/10",The Terminator

When I heard the first two were better, I bought both of them without a second thought, before even watching them. Was I disappointed? NO.The Terminator is without a doubt the defining Sci-Fi action film of all time. though future films of the same genre may have been better, this one stands alone as the founder of the marriage between Science-Fiction and Action films.The plot centers around the destruction of the world as we know it, due to computers becoming self-aware and destroying their makers: Humans. After a machine-induced nuclear holocaust, human survivors fight back against the machines, led by a man named John Connor. A computer-soldier called a ""Terminator"" is sent back in time by the machines, to kill the mother of John Connor, so he can never be born. The human resistance also sends one of their soldiers back in time, to protect the unborn child. Both soldiers are sent back to 1984, to battle over the fate of their future.Terminator is known as one of the most iconic story lines of all time, and rightfully so. This is one of those classics that has to be watched by any movie fanatic. It is one of the defining films of the 80's and the Sci-Fi genre.Taking this film simply as another sci-fi film, you may find it to be not much better than others. But the reason this movie deserves the ""great movie"" merit, is simply the concept behind it, a concept that has inspired many future science-fiction titles.Great Film 9/10 stars",The Terminator
607,emran222,This may well be the best Sci-Fi/Thriller ever made,10,31 January 2010,"The Terminator is a must see film for everyone, it's a sci-fi/thriller of epic proportions, it may look dated now as it was made in 1984, but then again the film is set in 1984 so it shouldn't be considered a big deal.The plot of the film is fairly simple, in the future there is a war between humans and machines and the machines are fighting a loosing battle and the reason for them loosing is because of a man named (John Connor) who is the leader of the human resistance and is the only man who knows how to stop the machines, so the machines decide to send one of their Android assassins called The Terminator back through time to kill john connor's mother(Sarah Connor) thus preventing john connor from being born and the machines being humanity's successor. however the human resistance is aware of this scheme and they also send in their toughest soldier (Kyle Reese; who is only human) to go and protect sarah connor from the terminator and what follows is an intense fight for survival for both Sarah connor and Kyle Reese who are up against a seemingly unstoppable killing machine.What makes the terminator such an incredible movie is that it's very clever, the plot line is not 100% original but it is very interesting and raises a question about humanity's future, ""Will Technology Reach a point where humans will no longer be in charge of society?"" Now it may not seem very likely that it will happen but as you can see everyone is updating on the latest computer technology and gadgets and you start to wonder when watching the movie how far will it go?The Director of the film (James Cameron) shows us a dark vision of the future with the war torn battlefields and giant robotic tanks killing humans, these scenes are not only cool to see but also truly frightening it's a place that you would not wan't to be.And the cast of the movie is well chosen the terminator is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger who is without a doubt the perfect choice for the role,as he looks very intimidating and shows no sign of emotion and you believe him in the role. Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton is also great in her role of a regular young woman who is unaware of the terror that is about to come her way and as time goes on she has to become strong in mind and body in order to survive, and Kyle Reese played brilliantly by Michael Biehn gives her encouragement throughout the film and plays the ultimate human protector as he is the one who knows more about the terminator than anyone else, and he has to rely on his own ingenuity to not only protect sarah but also himself. Now the special effects are very dated but there are some that still hold up to this day, the most dated special effect has to be the stop motion terminator endoskeleton in the end but then again it makes the terminator look more believable as it looks more robotic. The Action scenes are good and will keep you entertained, but don't go in expecting transformers.Overall: The Terminator is a classic in the Sci-Fi and Thriller Genre Check this movie out, you will definitely will get some entertainment out of it.10/10",The Terminator
608,LordLucansGhost,The best of the series,8,1 September 2021,"T2 was good fun; the action and cool factor is way up there, but.... this, the original Terminator is the real deal. In fact, I'm shocked that it's rated lower than the sequel. We won't even mention anything after the 2nd film because they're just not worth it. They were for the kids. Now back to the film in question.We all know the story, so I won't bother with explaining it. What I will do is give you my reasons as to why I think The Terminator is THE film of the franchise.The Terminator is a much better character as a baddie, and as baddies go, he's BAD! Arnie nails it in the role which catapulted him into super-stardom and he is absolutely terrifying. Let's remember that while the action is still good, this is a 'horror' film, and while we can deem this inferior to T2, nobody will deny the atmosphere is superior with the original.The atmosphere is dark, filmed mostly at night in bleak and deserted areas of Los Angeles, with a music score by Brad Fiedel which will make the hair stand on end! You won't raise a smile either watching this, it's an intense rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. It doesn't make you jump like todays horrors, it in fact induces a slow feeling of dread, especially as the Terminator says very few words throughout the film and gives you the overall impression that it is one very evil thing that just wants to kill it's target no matter what..and that is scary!It's a good story too, because it's original. Apparently it came to director James Cameron in a dream, in the same way as Yesterday did with Paul McCartney.I'm not going to nitpick that Camerons depiction of the future was a bit off, because that's missing the point, it's a truly monumental moment in cinema history, and every sequel owes itself to this.",The Terminator
609,jason-m-cook,The Terminator,9,10 September 2013,"The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) It's easy to see how The Terminator put James Cameron on the map. Whether or not the story is entirely original (and of course, like maybe all sci-fi concepts, it's been done again and again, in the Doctor Who story Day of the Daleks just to name one example), the way Cameron put it all together is impressive. The storyline generates lots of genuine suspense, even when you know exactly what's going to happen, even when you know how it will happen. Linda Hamilton makes a great protagonist, her character arc developing quite believably given her performance. The special effects and the dialogue are sometimes a bit cheesy... but it was the Eighties, what can you do?The chase/fight scenes are not overdone (unlike certain newer movies like Man of Steel and Pacific Rim). The sequence of the police psychologist interviewing Reese provides some welcome comic relief, as do a couple of other sequences here and there. Arnold Schwarzenegger's questionable acting abilities are actually put to good advantage: he plays a believable robot.Overall I am pleased with The Terminator, which deserves its positive reputation as a force of pop culture. Solid piece of science fiction too.Sarah Connor was just damn lucky she was listed as the last Sarah Connor in the phone book! 9/10",The Terminator
610,toronaga,Still a great movie after all these years,9,27 January 2008,"I bought this title after watching the first two installments of the new ""Sarah Conner Chronicles"". It was a favorite of mine back in the 80's and it still is. I don't care that the effects are not as pristine as they are today. It's the story, which along with ""Back To The Future"" explores aspects of time travel in an interesting way. It's also the way the Terminator is presented as a malevolence that is almost unstoppable. One of my favorite moments is watching Linda Hamilton's expression after Kyle Reese has pumped round after round in the the Terminator - and he still gets up! I swear, it is almost like ""The Omen"" - how do you stop a foe that is unstoppable? The 2nd movie was also good although I'm not wild about loudmouth kids acting beyond their years. I wish Arnold had remained the bad guy - that was where his real value was. The third movie was a fiasco. But this movie was and always will be my favorite of the franchise.",The Terminator
611,andrewplord,"Fun to be had, but...",7,13 June 2015,"No-one is going to deny that there is a lot of excitement and fun to be had here, but there are gaping plot holes ( a time travel plot will do that I suppose) and some pretty terrible writing. (""In the short time we had together we loved enough for a lifetime"" is one notable stinker) But can we mention a couple of things.1) The soundtrack. Surely the least effective collection of '80's synthesiser sounds trying to sound portentious ever recorded. Really a shocker. It clanks and plonks along with little connection to what's happening on screen and sounding like it was recorded in a barn. Horrible.2) Who was responsible for Linda Hamilton's hair? Sure it was the '80s, but seriously her hair looks like something a cocker spaniel might reject. And then it gets messed up and she gets it redone in the same style, just to prove it was deliberate. There's no excuse.3) The special effects... yes, I know the movie was done on the same amount as the catering budget Cameron used for Avatar, but even so, those effects where Arnie is pulling out his eyeball are a nonsense, they must be the least effective pipe bombs in history and the metal skeleton at the end - well, don't get me started on the metal skeleton. Ray Harryhausen could make an army of skeletons look believable and even charming in Jason and the Argonauts, but this thing is pretty damn lame.I suspect that when people say ""I love the Terminator movies"", what they really mean is ""I love Terminator 2"" - a rip snorter, exciting, innovative movie. If ever there was a movie series that came into its own with the sequel it's this one.",The Terminator
612,Macros-5,Ground breaking Science Fiction Thriller!!!,10,21 January 1999,"Terminator belongs up there with Star Wars for ground breaking Sci-Fi movies. Great plot, excellent execution of special effects, great action sequences. Arnold coins the phrase ""I'll be back!"". Incredible cast! This movie could turn a regular (non-sci-fi) moviegoer onto the genre. I only rated it a 9 because its sequel is even better. This is TOP SHELF!! Must see!",The Terminator
613,aleroy,Great sci-fi action,10,7 May 2002,"With ""The Terminator"", thus began Arnie's career in Sci-Fi films. I believe that while it's not as good as T2, The Terminator was definitely a ground-breaking film. Never has post-apocalyptic action kicked so much A**!",The Terminator
614,thewoodmeister,This is where it all started. The original and best.,10,3 November 2019,"There's a tone to this Terminator that it's successors have never been able to really replicate. It's gritty, it's dark, it's relentless and intense. The 80's creating a perfect backdrop for the machine from the future to wreck havoc.When we first meet Sarah Connor she's the naive girl next door. By the end of the film she's been transformed, and that transformation continues through T2 and now Dark Fate.Arnold as the Terminator is something that we're now all too familiar with and it's hard to look back with fresh eyes, but really this performance as the cold relentless killing machine from the future hasn't been equaled. There's an edge to him that has been rounded off over the subsequent sequels so the films could appeal to a wider (and younger) audience. This Terminator had no issue taking out a police station full of cops with an unflinching menace. No wise cracks here, this T-800 is a pure thing from your nightmares.Kyle Reese as the protector sent back to save Sarah Connor, is the outgunned (in this time) soldier from the future. The core of this film is actually his love for Sarah Connor, that's why he took this one way trip through time, to meet and protect the love of his life. Yes, a love story at the heart of a dark sci-fi film! The sequels have never tapped into this emotional core as well as the original.No review would be complete without mentioning the effects and the score. Terminator wouldn't be Terminator without the dark industrial score that underpins all the action. The special effects even though dated by today's high cgi standards still carry weight and gravitas, and Stan Winston's skill is undeniable. You really believe that there's a machine under Arnold's muscular frame. I remember the very first time I saw the film and just when you think it's over the chrome endoskeleton emerges from the fire.... immense.There'll never be a Terminator film like this one, but largely that's because it was of its time, it was original and new. However I do believe that we could learn something of its tone and grit and it's emotional core if this franchise is to move forward after Dark Fate.If you haven't seen this film it's the original and best and stands up as one of the best sci fi films of all time.",The Terminator
615,ertkocak,masterpiece,9,28 December 2020,"He addressed many important issues such as the development of artificial intelligence, the increase of machines in human life, the dependence on technology and the human instinct to fight.

618,moviefan-85,"Ultimate classic of 80,s!",10,8 March 2004,"Terminator is my favourite movie so i LOVE IT! Movie was made so long time ago and still it feels fresh. I cant describe how good movie is this. I remember when I was 7 or 8 I watched this movie with such excitement. I always liked the first more than Terminator 2 Judgement day ( That is too one hell of a movie). I dont know single human who hasnt seen this movie because this is action sci-fi classic. Like Special effects wizaed Stan Winston who has workin on all T movies said: "" Terminator was landmark in movie history"". Totally awesome movie. I wont starting telling you a plot because everyone knows it. At that time it was just called B movie. Studios didnt think that Terminator would be such a commercial and critical hit. It launched James Camerons and Arnold Schwarzeneggers to sky. Cameron become Hollywoods respect director and Arnie became actionstar. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton did amazing perfomances. The movies budget was only 8 million dollars but still movie rocks!! Of cource special effects are bit old but it doesnt take the pleasure of seeing this movie. Cameron is such srong and good director that this could be made on limited budget. Buy special edition Dvd and I promise you will enjoy the extramaterial. James Cameron also wrote Arnies legendary line ""I´ll be back"". That became Arnolds trademark in his films. Checkout Bill Paxton in the beginning of the film as one of the punks. In Kyles dream when Terminators attack humans shelterbase check Stuntman and Arnolds Frien Franco Columbu as Terminator. Ultimate classic! See it if you havent seen in it already. Terminator fans write me! ""I´LL BE BACK""",The Terminator
619,sebtwister,"""It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.""",10,28 September 2016,"There used to be a time I thought the sequel blew this movie completely out of the water, because it's bigger and more epic in scale and the action is a lot stronger, but this is one of those films where it gets stronger with every re-watch. There's always something I pick up on every time I see it.The Terminator is an unrelenting experience to say the least and the whole premise of this where an almost indestructible machine only has one thing in mind, to kill you, and will stop at absolutely nothing to do it, is terrifying. It is such a simple premise, yet the way James Cameron writes and directs these characters makes this film almost perfect in my eyes.Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner is a much more grounded and vulnerable character in this film compared to the badass she would become in the sequel. In fact, she was completely unrecognisable to me once the second film roles on, yet it never feels far- fetched she would become this way because of how good the character development is in this film. You see her gradually become the soldier she is truly destined to be and all of it feels real. Plus, you've gotta love that mullet :)Michael Biehn as Kyle Reece is terrific in this film and again he also feels like a grounded character. In fact straight away it's impossible not to see the vulnerability of the character when you see all the marks and scars all over his body as he comes through the time portal. He is completely outmatched by The Terminator he is assigned to protect Sarah from so he has to out smart it. You see that life as a soldier in a post-apocalyptic world where man fights machines, is the only thing he has ever known in his life, and there's a lot of great flashback scenes that really emphasise that point so effectively. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn share great chemistry together as well, I really did buy the fact they loved each other despite the fact they only know each other for a day.Of course, how could I not mention Arnie as The Terminator. He's another one of those badass villains that has very little dialogue, but you you feel the intensity amp up every time he's on screen. To say he is a presence would be an understatement, he is friggin' scary as a villain because all he cares about is killing Sarah Conner... that's it, that is the only thing he was sent to do and he stops at absolutely nothing to do it. It is just so intense, when you see a scene where Kyle shoots him multiple times, and all it does is buy some time. And it just returns to the deadly game of cat and mouse.There are only brief fleeting moments where the film allows you to breathe. There is not a single scene in the film where I felt like it was filler or just there to kill time, it is a tightly edited masterpiece of cinema that just never lets up. It doesn't dumb itself down so that its more accessible to the audience either, there's a good 45 minutes or so where you don't know why this thing is targeting Sarah, or why she is so important and it doesn't matter because the film allows the atmosphere to take over. When she does find out why she's being targeted, it never feels tacked on, forced or drawn out with exposition.I would not change a single thing about the story or the characters in this film. There are one or two effects in this such as the 'eye' scene are dated by today's standards, but given the films budget was only $6 million, significantly smaller than the blockbuster sequel, there's bound to be a few dated scenes here or there, but it doesn't hurt the experience. There's still something about that final scene with the stop motion exoskeleton that just has my skin crawling. It is such an intense final act, that had me gripped right to the end! It is a filmmaking achievement and one of my favourite films of all time :)",The Terminator

626,TheUnholyPeanut,James Cameron proves how amazing he is with this film.,9,10 June 2021,"Just after making a pile of garbage, Piranha 2, Director James Cameron would make something amazing just 3 years later, and that would become The Terminator, one of the greatest action and science fiction films ever.I will first begin with the acting. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is pretty limited in acting, amazingly plays the T-800 in this film, with robotic-like facial expressions filled with no emotion and a cold, terrifying voice. These two elements are what makes T-800 absolutely terrifying in this film. We cannot also forget Linda Hamilton, who plays the character of Sarah Connor superbly in this film. In this film, she is terrified of the T-800. Her acting shows a desperate feeling to survive this terrifying unstoppable cyborg. It makes us, the audience, feel Sarah's fear in this film. Michael Biehn also gives a great performance as Kyle Reese.James Cameron's directing is also amazing in this film. The action scenes are amazingly directed and shot, especially the police station shootout, which gives a feeling of fear in our hearts as the dark, fiery atmosphere, combined with the acting and James Cameron's superb directing truly makes for one of the greatest action sequences in history. There is also the final scene, in which James Cameron uses stop motion to animate the T-800. Normally, this would look weird, or bad, but the jittery movements of the T-800 in the final scene makes the T-800 feel even more horrifying then he already was. The directing and editing in this film makes the movie MUCH extremely tense, and James Cameron also proves he is one of the greatest directors of all time.Last but not least, The screenplay. It is not one of the best screenplays ever, but still a very great one. The dialogue for T-800, such as ""I'll be back"", makes him radiate an aura of inhumanity and coldness. The film's screenplay also greatly introduces the universe of The Terminator, as it introduces key organizations such as Skynet and The resistance, and other mysterious characters that we eventually learn more about. The key plot's main concept and idea is simple, yet extremely complex at the same time.The Terminator is one of the greatest action and science films of all time, and maybe one of the greatest films of all time. It has one of the most terrifying antagonists ever, an intelligent screenplay, and James Cameron proves that he is one of the all time greats in terms of directors.",The Terminator

It's no secret that even today many movies are inspired by The Terminator and why shouldn't they when we have 3 amazing actors (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn) who simply gave their all for this movie to be a hit? Sure the plot may seem as far too complicated at first but James Cameron wanted to get deep into the entire time paradox and he made it. Was it a success? Well i think that if it wasn't then The Terminator wouldn't be considered one of the top movies of all time. Is a time paradox like that possible? Probably not since something needs to exist now in order to exist in the future and not vice versa but in the end we are talking about a movie and it simply doesn't get any better than this.",The Terminator

I was just a kid when it first came out but it stuck it my head as being forward thinking even then.

A new book called ""Radical Evolution"" by Joel Garreau explores various endeavors by DARPA (Goverment's (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) The direction that scientists in the book are taking is one geared towards making people more than human (Enhanced) and melding them with machine and vice versa.

631,Dave Evans,The defining film of our generation,10,16 December 1999,"Well, my generation at least. Terminator is referenced in so many films it becomes impossible to list, it can be held responsible for a deluge of 'robot from the future' films, and yet its memory remains untarnished. Why? Because this is where it all began (yes I know there were similar films before Terminator, but how many can *you* name? And how many were this influential?) As well as launching the careers of most of the actors, it catapulted James Cameron into the limelight. The plot, which seems so simple (robot from the future comes to kill someone) is incredibly complex, depending on how far you wish to analyze it. There is so much material in the Terminator world that even the sequel barely scratched the surface, and although it is only hinted at in this, the background history (future?) gives the story unparalleled depth. I can't think of another film that has ever had me thinking about the possibilities for so long (and then you start thinking about temporal paradoxes and go insane...) or that has captivated me so completely. The Terminator is the only film that I could even think of describing as flawless, and it still remains my fervent wish to see it on the big screen (sadly I was 4 when it was released) So in case I'm being too subtle for you, I absolutely love this film.",The Terminator
632,Gravedigger-2,One of the best movies you'll ever see...[spoilers],10,19 November 2000,"The Terminator is a lot of things. For one thing, it's scary. Well, the movie itself isn't scary, nor was it intended to be, but the message it projects certainly is. It shows us a future full of killing, suffering, and pain. Another holocaust really. And we all brought it upon ourselves because we went too far with our technology.It's exciting. The movie never gets dull. The action sequences really stand out from other films. It's well acted. Arnie plays the emotionless cyborg to perfection. No one else could've played the T-800 but Arnold. Michael Biehn is probably the best actor in this film, showing many sides to his character. We really do get a sense of where he came from. Linda Hamilton was a great heroine as well and her character certainly develops well. Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield play entertaining cops. Everyone else was adequate at least. Look for Bill Paxton as one of the earlier Terminator victims.It's a mix of genres. We have the T-800 knocking people off like in a horror movie. He even walks in and slaughters a couple after they've made love. The action parts of the film is obviously. It's Sci-Fi, with the whole time travel + cyborg stuff. It's also a love story.Speaking of which, this movie is also emotionally touching. The sex scene between Kyle and Sarah actually enhanced the plot rather than be an excuse to see some cleavage. Not to mention, the music for that scene was just right and so were the camera angles. And when Kyle died in the end, you really felt something. Especially when Sarah pulls him over and sees that he isn't breathing. Also when she sees him being zipped up in the body bag.All in all, the Terminator is a reason why I love movies so much.

Not to say that this movie is overlooked, because it's not, it's just not recognized as much as it should be.  Just about every sci-fi thriller in that last 10 years or so owes something to this movie.  It's an amazing movie to watch and take in, it's no wonder why this movie should and will go down as one of the best ever made.  It's a great movie...9 out of 10",The Terminator

Future terrors of Artificial Intelligence arriving today in the form of an unfeeling and indestructible hulk programmed to do one thing perfectly well. Arnold is the mythic Golem, but designed without error and sent through time to ravage an unprepared world. The concise, perfectly looped plot pits man vs. Machine; Reese, the human, like his cybernetic foe is similarly programmed for constant warfare by the dystopia he was born into. But he fights for something beyond himself, for love. And through he and Sarah Connor's death-defying travails against the Terminator, the exact future Skynet works to prevent is born.

Explain to me how the second one would have made any sense without the first one?  I know this because I saw the second one first and thought, ""wow, what a great movie, yet there are points in it I don't understand"". Then I saw the first one, explained those missing points and ideas.  So much better in almost everyway.  I will admit the production and special effects are better in the second one(for obvious reasons).  But, how can you say the second is more dramtic when it's the same thing on the first one(done better I will say) and for storyline, it's also THE SAME THING!   The first one was much more impacting on society than the second for the reasons of it's a brand new idea, it's a novel concept that if thought about, could quite possibly happen, and for it's time, it was way ahead in special effects and such.     The future is un-written and you MUST keep an open mind toward these kinds of movies or you will absolutely hate them.                                     10/10 easy.",The Terminator

""he, how about giving me you're lunch money?"" responding like:""how about i give YOU a knuckle sandwich instead?""

647,superferb,One of the best Films ever made,10,14 August 2013,"The Terminator is easily one of the very best films ever made, in any genre. If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made.But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though: The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much ""phatter"", ""cooler"", ""crasser"" action in the decades since 1984.Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film.The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible.There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly.One reviewer commented that ""the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first"". Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes.Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the ""future"". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask ""but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?"". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.",The Terminator
648,sean-1225,"One of my favourite Sci-Fi films of all time, and just as good as T2...",10,7 June 2009,"First of all I would just like to point out that James Cameron is my favourite director of all time, as he has made films such as The Terminator, Aliens and of course, Terminator 2. If you have seen Terminator 2 or 3, you may not have seen the original. It is completely different to all of it sequels in a good way, and that is what I like about it. The story is basically about the war between humans and machines in 2029, and the machines send back to a Terminator to kill Sarah Conor, as she gives birth to John Conor, the leader of the human resistance. Although it seems like all hope is lost, the humans send back one of there soldiers, Kyle Reece. Only one person would be able to play Terminator, and that would be Arnold. He has the mood that the Terminator needs, and defiantly makes people laugh with all his lines throughout the films. Michael Bhien was also brilliant as Kyle Reece. It is hard too describe what genre this film can be classified as. It could be action due to how many times The Terminator, Kyle Reece and Sarah Conor meet the police. It could be horror due to all the deaths The Terminator causes, which could also be classified as slasher. The only problem I have with the film is the music, which is that 80's dance music which I hate, whereas T2 has some great music. Defiantly check this film out though as I am sure you will enjoy it, even though it is not as good as T2!",The Terminator

Skynet has begun to lose the war, and to finally be able to annihilate mankind it must change the past. Therefore it sends a humanoid robot a terminator back in time to kill Sarah Connor, whose unborn son John will be mans only hope and lead the resistance against the machines. John in turn sends one of his soldiers, Kyle Resse to protect her from the terminator.The plot are epic, absolutely epic and are also one of the best plots in movie history.This movie made Arnold Schwarzenegger a real star, his is perfect as the Terminator, other actor and actresses in the movie are Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton are also were good in there roles.This and Terminator 2, are probably James Camerons most famous movies, James Camerons best movies in my opinion are Terminator 2 and Titanic, but of course his job in this film is stunning as well.Terminator is and will always be classed as one of the best movies of all time and if you haven't seen it that is something you have to do.",The Terminator

652,lnobrien21,With Praise Still Underrated,9,12 October 2018,"Terminator 2 has always been in my top 5 favourite movies of all time, however, over time my apreciation for James Cameron's first film has grown massively. This movie balances a very personal story with end of the world stakes, superbly well. Kyle Reese (Michael Bhien) is a very well written character, his motivations are set up nicely and his development throughout the movie is really Interesting. The Idea of Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) character and what she means is so amazingly interestingand it really gets your brain going, which is a problem with movies today. The 80s time period in which this film was made, and obviously set, feels so fitting to the story. The monster that is the Terminator, played off course by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is simply terrifying. A big beefy man that is a machine designed to kill immediately creates this sense of nervousness. When you're watching this film you have this feeling to look over your shoulder, almost like It Follows (2014) does. Every action scene is gripping and feels haunting. The score by Brad Fiedel feels very dated at times and is kinda goofy but the main theme remains one of my favourites. This film to me did so many things for the first time in cinema history and doesn't get the credit somerhing like say Star Wars does. The Terminator is one of my all time favourites and really deserves appreciation.",The Terminator
653,oskar-nyman,Tension build up on a higher level.,9,13 July 2017,"The Terminator is a great movie according to me. The tension build up for the scenes are executed extremely well. The movie hints with similar but subtle choices of scene blocking, and soundtrack at different parts of the movie to create a form of dramatic tension.The story is interesting and the symbolism that lies under it. The symbolism can be found both in visual gags and in the story concept. Example: Bill Paxton's character has a tire track mark as a tattoo on his face. This mirrors the scene from the future war were a Machine Tank drives over a stack of human skulls. And what happens? Bill's character gets figuratively driven over by the machines. (He gets killed by The Terminator).The visual effects works for all but maybe one scene. The close up of The Terminator's face just before he puts on his famous sunglasses (to hide his now visible robot eye), looks kind of too dummy looking. The rest of the effects works great. The context helps some of the effects. Like that the Terminator skeleton's walking style is a bit weird. They added a concept of which that the Terminator was damaged in the foot. Which in universe makes the weird walking style more appealing. The movie follows the Chekhov's gun principle in many ways. There is nothing wrong with filler details though. This movie is good at planting such Chekhov objects. Some require multiple viewings to notice.Things the movie did right: The plot, both overall and subplots. The love story. The soundtrack. The technique used for tension building. The less is more editing. Multiple minor gags that I find entertaining. Hidden symbolism.Things the movie could have done better: The close up of the dummy Terminator face could have been shot differently for more belief. They should have kept the deleted scene at the end. 10/10",The Terminator

It is NOT overtaken by any of its sequels, despite what many say.The plot follows a cyborg assassin- disguised as a human- known as a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that travels back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Sent to protect Sarah- also from 2029- is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). Sarah is targeted because Skynet (a highly advanced artificial intelligence) knows that her unborn son will lead the fight against them. With the virtually unstoppable Terminator in hot pursuit, she and Kyle attempt to escape.**SKIP PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS** This film is actually very upsetting. Reese's death is one of the most upsetting death scenes in any film in my opinion. It is accompanied by a sad-sounding version of the films theme song. Truly harrowing. **SPOILERS END HERE**This film is a cult phenomenon and is also widely considered as of the best Sci-Fi films of all time. It also had an incredibly low-budget (as seen by some of the CGI and very obvious rubber masks).

655,EISMediaGroup,The reason that Kyle Reese did not have to go back in time to save Sarah Connor,10,21 July 2017,"After having watched the ""Terminator"" franchise in its entirety over the past week, I have come to a realization.In ""The Terminator"" (1984) the ""Resistance"" led by John Connor, having already won the war in the original (and most definitive) timeline, needed not send Kyle Reese back in time to save Sarah Connor from the T-800 that was sent to kill her. John Connor had already been born, and the war had already been won.This is how I see ""The Terminator"" (1984) playing out if The T-800 had been sent back in time by Skynet to kill Sarah, and Kyle Reese had not been sent back in time by John Connor to protect Sarah.-Sarah Connor was already carrying the child of Stan Morsky which would later become John Connor.-The T-800 would have gone on its killing spree looking for Sarah Connor, capturing the attention of the news media, and prompting Sarah to seek police protection.-The police would have arrived at the Tech Noir club sooner and picked up Sarah before the T-800 arrived because the police would not have been stalled due to Kyle Reese's presence in the area. (He was being looked for as well because of his assault on police in the beginning of the movie).-The Police would have taken Sarah into protective custody.-The T-800's search would have been stalled.-Eventually Sarah Connor would have been moved to a military compound after police see that the killer, (The T-800) had not been apprehended or found.-The T-800 would find Sarah's mother's address after having killed Ginger and Matt in Sarah's apartment.-The T-800 would kill Sara's mother and ""copy"" her.-Sarah would eventually call her ""mother"" from the military compound with her whereabouts with the T-800 intercepting the information.-The T-800 would stock up on weapons at gun stores and kill the clerks, further drawing the attention of law enforcement and military personnel.-The T-800 would storm the military compound with the police in hot pursuit as well as the military, the navy , and the coast guard having been alerted of it's presence in the vicinity of the compound.-The military personnel would shoot the T-800 down with rifles. The T-800 would continue to advance.-Seeing that their bullets had little effect on him, they would begin shooting him with grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles decimating him.-Bits and pieces of the T-800's cpu chips and the electrical components that constitute the T-800 were found, studied and duplicated preserving the Skynet foundational elements (These elements were already inevitable in the ""Terminator universe however.) -Skynet, judgement day, and the war against the machines commences.-John Connor and the resistance defeats Skynet in 2029.-Movie over.",The Terminator
656,catalyst-7,It's about transformation,9,4 March 2000,"I just saw a horrifying, touching, very good movie again; it's The Terminator.  Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman.  That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to ""get on your feet, soldier.""  She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous.  And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.It's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me.  It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart.  It's quickly developing love story touches me.  Its humor makes the dark places in me smile.  But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation.

657,Emre-kyncu68,THE TERMINATOR,7,13 April 2020,"The Terminator, the first film of the terminator series, which is a 36-year-old series, still manages to be a traceable quality film even though it was produced in 1984. At that time, he was one of the best science fiction movies with Star Wars and Alien. In 2029, terminators take over the world. Terminators are intelligent robots made of almost immortal strong metal, bullet proof and human skin. John Connor, on the other hand, is able to kill these terminators thanks to the technology he finds and he fights against the terminators with the people who are left behind. He returns to the past with a time machine on the terminator and tries to kill Sarah Connor, his mother, so that John Connor was never born. The scenario is briefly like this. First of all, although the movie is a 36-year-old movie, it does not reveal it at all. The terminator character is both realistic and puts the name's weight. Arnold Schwarzenegger is cut out for the terminator role. Overall, the player selections are successful. The script is also beautifully detailed and beautifully rendered. The voiceover fits well into the characters. Music is suitable for the theme of the movie. The only thing that gets stuck in my head comes from the future of Kyle and is John Connor's father in the future. How did John Connor know that Kyle was his father, or if he made a mistake and sent someone else out of Kyle into the past, he would never have been born.

All these movies like: Star Trek, Star Wars, Battle Star Galactica, etc. started really to bore the people. Of course Star Trek and Star Wars were pretty cool, but after those movies, the rip-off sci-fi started. Until 1984. This year was an important year for the science-fiction, because this is the story: in 2029 the world is in hands of the machines, which are raised out of the nuclear mess after the Nuclear War. But the machines are almost defeated by mankind, thanks to their leader John Connor. But the machines sent a advanced cyborg back to 1984 to kill the mother of this leader: Sarah Connor. The humans sent also a fighter back to protect sarah and make sure that John Connor will be born.Nobody could ever make a science-fiction with a story like this, but after The Terminator, there came a lot of movies like this. Movies like: Cyborg, Timecop and many more. Another important thing of The Terminator are the actors. In The Terminator are exactly the right actors chosen and so is the music.

I started watching it thinking it was gonna be good - it was great. If there's anything I didn't like, it was that they made the future seem so dark. Overall it had a great sense of being in the action from beginning to end. I sure didn't expect the terminator to die in the way he did, neither did I expect Reese to get killed either. Another thing I liked was that Sarah Connor didn't even believe Reese about the Terminator until the police station scene (that was pretty funny how she saw the Terminator get up after being shot in the club, and still didn't believe it). I do have a question, though. When the Terminator went into the gun shop, they didn't do a background check for him or make him sign any forms (before he shot the clerk). Imagine if they did...""Sir, you're from the future, you're a man-killing robot, and we can't sell you these."" But my point is - this is a great movie for both action and sci-fi lovers alike.

The story of a cyborg brought back through time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, a woman who's unborn son will become a military leader and help mankind fight the machines who will take over the world in a near-future captivated movie-goers everywhere around the world. The movie was shot with a $6 million budget and ended up grossing more than $80 million worldwide and became a sci-fi classic among fans. Although the movie was overshadowed by its 1991 super-sequel, T2, The Terminator stands on its own and manages to give good thrills and great action sequences even with its small budget. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect in is landmark role as a fearless mean-killing machine who has no remorse and no pity for poor Sarah Connor who's life changes after Kyle Reese, a soldier who was also sent back from the future to protect Sarah against the terminator. Linda Hamilton is excellent and so is Michael Biehn as Sarah's love interest and father of her son, Kyle Reese. Most people have seen T2 and have missed this incredible first chapter to one of the best science-fiction sagas in movie history. I give The Terminator a good 8.5/10 for its action, its director and Arnold Schwarzenegger for one of his most impressive performance.",The Terminator

667,clementtuffreau,a cold war masterpiece,10,4 May 2006,"As used to say a friend of mine watching Terminator : cold war masterpiece. You couldn't say it a better way. James Cameron's best movie might be the most dry movie you'll ever see. It is not a movie, in fact, it is a tunnel. Once you enter it, you cannot go out until the end. The talent of great directors is to operate a kind of fusion between a great universal story (here : primal fear, pure fear, and violence) and powerful images. The talent of genius is to invent a character that will be used out of the context of the art form : it has been the case for Lewis Carrol's Alice, Jerry Siegel's Superman, it is the case for TERMINATOR. Cameron, alongside with Schwarzenneger, has invented a legend : the pure, the perfect killing machine. It never stops. The Terminator is the definition of cinema : once the film has started, it wont stop until THE END. Once the Terminator arrives, it won't stop either. After that very simple (but so powerful) basic rule, Cameron has just put everything he had in his hands to make it quick, straight and super clear. The editing is direct. Pictures are clear. Music is brilliant, reminding of Carpenter's Assault, meeting with an industrial rock band. Each element of the script is given in a short dialog between bullets storm. So why a cold war masterpiece ? Well, with this dark light, poor areas, lost streets, suburbs houses looking all alike, with Schwarzenneger and his very far far away English accent, you've never seen a movie making the USA look that close to the Soviet Union.",The Terminator
668,wouterstaut,James Cameron's first take on sci-fi is the perfect 80's classic,8,10 August 2021,"This movie is a definition and standard for all other 80's movies. James Cameron's first movie sets the perfect tone for his later work. Arnold Schwarzenegger is , even tough he doesn't say much, the best aspect of this film. You can feel the stakes and I love the time travelling love triangle paradox. This movie feels like a practice for Aliens which is even more awesome than this movie. The neo-noir technique gives this grimm and dark tone that fits perfectly with this movie. So if you want a good 80's action sci-fi classic, i suggest you check this one out.",The Terminator
669,webflyer,Finely crafted science fiction,9,3 March 2006,"What I most enjoyed about The Terminator was the great writing of the story. If you stand back and look at the overall movie, it is very similar to the well-written sci-fi stories that you read in the anthologies. The screenplay's brilliance lies in its ability to tell a science fiction story within a contemporary urban setting, without losing any of the impact of making you feel like you have been transported to another world.The special effects look a little dated (although it's amazing what was done given the limitations) for those who are purists for that sort of thing, but if you like a good sci-fi story, you will very quickly start to forget about analyzing the special effects. There is significant violence in the film, just as a warning, although frankly I think it is not gratuitous and is not nearly as bad as what you might see in a thriller/horror movie today.So if you find yourself getting annoyed with the quality of science fiction movies today, or if you feel that lately the fantasy movies are getting all of the attention, go see The Terminator and you will be pleasantly surprised at how exciting it is!",The Terminator

But you're wrong. The first is more than just a simple B-movie. T2 doesn't come even close to the first.Yeah, the clothes and SFX are out-dated. But you can't blame it. It's of 1984 after all. Other than that the first is way better than the sequel. (still the sequel is one of the best sequel movie of all. and in action-wise, the sequel is better)",The Terminator
671,Patrick_Allan,"An incredible film, and one that needs no introduction",10,17 July 2003,"I first saw Terminator when was a kid (way under 18 years oldwhich was the certificate at the time) because it was the film tosee. When we were 8 years old this was our equivalent of a videonasty and when my mother found out I'd seen it she went berserk!Of course, anyone who's seen it and appreciated it will understandthat it's far from nasty and in fact isn't very violent at all consideringthat most of the violence is carried out against a machine.Nowadays I still regard this as a 'must-see' film but for completelydifferent reasons.Until recently I looked at the IMDb top 250 films and wondered whythis was rated so highly. I liked it, but didn't think it deserved to bein the top 250 films at all. Now I look at it and think it should behigher. The story behind The Terminator is excellent, and theaction scenes that go along with it are breathtaking. There are somany moments of high tension in this film you will definitely not beable to look away from the screen. I'm very rarely scared for acharacter's life in films, but there are some moments in this whereI seriously think James Cameron is going to kill one of them offunexpectedly. A lot of scenes are very powerful too, probablybecause of the musical score which has stuck with the seriesthrough to the new T3 (at least I have gathered that from thetrailer). The acting is top class too, and I find it hard to believe thatSchwarzenegger was original cast as Kyle Reese, the good guy,when he is so perfect in his role as The Terminator. No one couldhave fulfilled the role better than Arnie!As I've said, this film needs to introduction as I'm sure mostpeople have heard of it, but those who haven't seen it should do somost definitely. It's not just a Schwarzenegger action flick, it's abrilliant powerful sci-fi too, and should be seen by all film fans.",The Terminator
672,Dude_001,"James Cameron's ""Terminator"" is a complex blend of classic science fiction, high octane action, and immense terror, glazed with style and deep with story.",9,6 March 2009,"The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger), a seemingly indestructible and emotionless cyborg, is sent from the future to kill young Sarah Connor( Linda Hamilton), who holds the key to a future war. Kyle Reese( Michael Biehn), a young man who has grown up in the ruins and ashes of a destroyed world, is sent from the future to warn and protect her. Both The Terminator and Kyle have no intentions of failing their missions, but only one can succeed...James Cameron's ""Terminator"" is a complex blend of classic science fiction, high octane action, and immense terror, glazed with style and deep with story. There are so many little things that make this movie great. I love the irony of the opening scenes: The Terminator, who has come to seek, to kill, and to destroy, does just this, all without alarming the local police. Kyle Reese, who has come to protect and serve, is soon being chased and hunted thy the police. Not long after, there is a scene where the ruthless Terminator steels a police car and adopts an officer's voice, essentially joining the police ranks, all to hunt down Kyle, who has become a wanted criminal. It's this helter skelter social commentary and pessimistic irony, that comprises the film's dark, gritty tone. It is interesting to note that this is a dark film, and the ""Terminator"" series has increasingly become more mainstream and child-friendly over the years, with a 'good guy' Terminator, child actors, and a possible pg-13 rating for the fourth film, Terminator: Salvation. The first film however, remains a dark and gritty little thriller.The thing that makes ""The Terminator"", ""The Terminator"", is Schwarzenegger's performance as The Terminator. This is without a doubt the greatest performance I have ever seen from Schwarzenegger. Though some may mock and say "" He's only playing a robot, and he's only doing a good job because playing a mechanical being requires no acting"", Schwarzenegger does an incredible job that few top notch actors could pull off. In a word, The Terminator is scary, and most of what creates that sense of fear is Arnold's presence: his hulking, looming body, his mechanical gestures, his soulless facial expressions, his cold, emotionless voice. The Terminator is ruthless, cold, impossible to reason with, heartless. He feels no pain nor pity. He is a man made force that dedicates all to the mission at hand. When watching the film, I was reminded of the character of Michale Myers in John Carpenter's slasher ""Halloween"". Cold, ruthless, always in the shadows and ready to strike. Truly The Terminator is the Michale Myers of action films. And it is Arnold Schwarzenegger that makes us believe: makes us believe that he's out there, and he will find you, because thats what he does. That's all he does.Opposing the one man(Err, machine?)army Terminator is a great cast of Jame's Cameron favorites. Michael Biehn does a knock out job as the scarred war-child from the future, I absolutely love his performance in this film. He has a sense of urgency and child like confusion emitting from him that fits not only his character and his development, but the story has a whole. When Kyle speaks, all listen. Linda Hamilton is a blast to watch as the sweet waitress who finds herself thrust into chaos and bloodshed. She's believable, what an I say? Also, for the screen time they receive, Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen as Lieutenant Ed Traxler and Detective Hal Vukovich respectively, are a blast to watch. They have excellent chemistry and work off each other excellently.The effects are also quite good. Sure there are some cheesy lazer beams here and there, but overall the special effect where really good. The future war scenes/flashbacks are nicely crafted and disturbingly juxtaposed into images from our own society. The Terminator effects are also very well done. There are just so many great scenes and so many great lines littered throughout this film. The scene in the Tech Noir club, the explosive police station scene, the scene with Linda and Kyle under the bridge. The Terminator has a very limited vocabulary, but he knows how to use it: When he leans in to tell the police receptionist that ""I'll be back"", you want to cheer. And the musical score by Brad Fiedel is just great.The ending scene is probably one of my favorite scenes in the film. It ties everything together and leads perfectly into what is yet to come. It gives you a thirst for more, and sets the stage for an even more large scale Terminator adventure.Which came in 19919/10",The Terminator
673,fliper78617,A Great achievement in Film making,9,19 April 2003,"The Terminator serves as one of the best movies made in 1984 with a well thought out story, well written screenplay and put it midly excellent direction. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the silent killing machine known to man as The Terminator (T-800 Model 101) and is sent into time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)to prevent the birth of her son, future leader resistence John Connor. A future soldier by the name of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent to 1984, to intercept The Terminator  before it kills Sarah. The acting in this film is memorable, Arnold is perfect as The Terminator with absoutely no emotion of killing people. Biehn is great as Reese a soldier who is bound by duty and honor but never has experienced Love in his life which he will receive later on and is potrayl is so real you can not help but feel sorry for him. Hamilton does a wonderful potrayl as Sarah Connor the victim of all this who can't believe that she will be the mother for the future and is scared about what happens when she has this child. Other supporting Actors are good including Paul Winfield and the late Lance Henriksen a Cameron favorite. This is proberly James Cameron's greatest achievement in 1984 whenever he made this movie he wrote and directed, along with his former wife producer Gale Anne Hurd. The Visual Effects in today's standards are not up to par but however still they are bot bad for a movie made in 1984 and besides Orion Pictures Studio only gave him a 6.4 millon dollar budget to work nothing much i would say. However the makeup designs and creations by Stan Winston are still excellent to this day he remains one of the best Creature designs ever (Endoskeleton for example remains the best work in 1984). The Terminator serves as a great art for filmmaking it inspires filmmakers to make what you have. Regular scale: 4.5/5; 1-10 Scale: 9.5/10.

Overmore it's full of action and you can't take a breath for even a second. The script is congenial strait but leaves enough space for short romantic intimacy. And what a great soundtrack. It always seems as if there is something looming in the dark; where you can't see. Arnie did what he can do best and he gave us one of the most famous One-Liners in film history.

Personally, I'm not sure why everyone prefers the sequel to this, but I couldn't even tolerate T2 due to the way they played it for cheap laughs and Schwarzenegger got to play the good guy, which doesn't make a lot of sense.Biehn plays the part of the lone protector just as he should: desperate and unsure of himself, but with enough focus on his mission that he'll try as hard as he can to protect Sarah. Schwarzenegger plays the killing machine as a cold and unfeeling thing, unconcerned with anything at all except its end goal. Hamilton is great as an everywoman who has to muster more than she thinks she has just to survive and to deal with what she's told is coming ahead.The only missteps were the relationship between Reese and Connor, as I thought this seemed out of place tonally and turned the movie into a different direction than it should have been going. Luckily, that's a small part of the movie and can easily be overlooked by how great the rest of it really is.I'm not an action movie fan, but Cameron is right on target here and made me a believer.

680,AvhHines,Cameron does effects and action to sell his stories,10,5 November 2006,"So many people write James Cameron off as a writer/director who specializes in action and special effects. While it's true that almost no one does either better, I have always believed that Cameron uses these tools in order to get people to see his stories - not the other way around as some here seem to think. Cameron is a sci-fi buff and a true romantic in the original sense (i.e. romance not necessarily as sexual love, but adventure and belief in greater possibilities than mundane life often suggests).I remember being made to watch this movie in 1986 by my then boyfriend, having assumed from its star (Schwarzenegger) and its title that it was simply mindless, stupid violence. The first few minutes, showing the war in the future, made me realize that I'd been completely wrong - as a fan of science fiction books, I realized I was seeing the real thing as only Kubrick, Lucas, and Spielberg had done it thus far. I became a Cameron fan then and there; all the elements he has shown since were demonstrated: a compelling story that always centers on a real love (whether it be between a couple, or a child and parents), a sharp sense of humor coupled with a slight sadness or wistful element, flawless art direction and as good effects as can be got for the money and time it was made, highly believable performances, and an utter relentlessness that, each time you think it's finally over, turns out not to be.I see time and time again the criticism that the movie is dated in its styles of clothing, music, and cars. This puzzles me. You don't watch a movie of the thirties or forties and think how dated it is; it was made when it was made and reflects that time. I can only figure that a lot of folks remember themselves in the eighties and somehow now are embarrassed that they followed the fashions of the times and not those now current twenty years later. This is silly; how could you or a movie of the eighties have incorporated the customs or tastes of a later time? The movie was made in 1984 and has its characters dressed, listening to music, and driving cars accordingly - get over it! Probably one of the primary reasons this criticism comes up is that the movie has held up so well in other ways. Hundreds of sci-fi movies have been made since, and yet, except for the weakness of some of the stop-action effects of the endo-skeleton Terminator, this movie can pretty much hold its own with any of them. In fact, I suspect that had not Cameron done The Terminator and, shortly thereafter, Aliens, sci-fi movies would not be what they are today. This movie ranks with Star Wars in raising the bar as to what constitutes good sci-fi in movies and few, if any, since have quite equalled them.If you have somehow managed to miss this movie, and enjoy a story with crisp dialog, good performances, incredible suspense, and a truly moving love story, I suggest you get your hands on a copy ASAP. I doubt you'll regret it.",The Terminator

It is almost entirely possible that this could happen.

S this is the story. Skynet, the creator of the terminators (the machines) sent back a T-800 terminator to kill Sarah Conner. The resistance sent back Kyle Reese to protect her.

689,benfield-larry09,Among the Best,9,8 April 2013,The Terminator launched an era of sci-fi action and endless copy cats that never lived up to the originals. The film sets a lone soldier Kyle Reese who is sent back through time to protect a woman Sarah Connor who has a important destiny in the future. His opponent is a half human half machine programmed to kill Sarah at all cost. The film is both quite violent yet blends a romantic story within it's plot that is touching and central to the story. For a film of the middle 1980's the visual effects are still good yet somewhat dated but when this film first appeared they were amazing. Stan Winston was a master of animatronics and makeup effects and his work shines here. Arnold Schwarzenegger comes off well as the emotionless machine and is well balanced by Micheal Biehn's passionate Reese. Linda Hamilton completes the trio and does solid acting as a confused and scared Sarah Connor who finds her world and reality crumbling as the film progresses toward it's conclusion. This film defined Arnold as action star and coined one of the most well known one liners in Hollywood history.,The Terminator

Character connections are made between Traxler and Vucovich in ways that lesser movies spend an hour+ trying to establish. Audience communication is to the point and bold, and nuanced when needed.Turns are made with ease. Introductions are established within moments. The movie carries momentum from scene to scene in unhurried haste. And when the lull occurs for the romance, it doesn't feel wasted. This is the action thriller template. Besides the mirror scene even the CGI still stands up.1.5 hours of glorifying action movie making that will stand the test of time.

694,NegativeReviewBot,Terminated film,1,18 May 2017,"Now for look back at this "" classic "".OK. For us or for this review it is 2017. Now according to this Dungeons & Dragons meets The day the earth stood still plot line , we humanity will create a genocidal race of machines in just 12 short years. In this sad scenario a woman named Sarah Conner who is In fact the mother of the leader of man kinds resistance against these murderous machines is to be killed. A very comforting thought knowing a girl who can't even get her tables orders straight will be our salvation.It business as usual for our heroine as she lands comfortably in her role as a 1980s twenty something. After ducking a phone call for her roommate that would land most men on the sex offender list , she is dumped on an evening dinner by her yuppie boyfriend. After being groped on her way she sets out for an average night in an average area of Los Angeles.During all this hoopla , two beings have arrived from the future. One is a terminator. A machine from the future sent back to the pre - internet era to kill Sarah Conner , and along the way mangle half the phone books in town. The other arrival is an enlisted army officer Named Kyle Reese. His job is effectively protect Sarah from the terminator using a rock salt gun and several firecrackers.The terminator begins killing Sarah Conner's all over Los Angeles in phone book order. ( this is why your number should always be unlisted folks.) Soon LAPD catches on and is out in force looking for our Sarah who is next on the list. This information reaches her by television at a local three star non zagat rated pizza joint. Immediately at this critical moment she goes to the pay phone to call the police station. It is out of order. To bad cell phones have not been invented.She decides that paying five bucks to make a pay phone call at a new wave bar on Pico ave. is the way to go. Nothing beats good new wave music , particularly in a movie whose soundtrack is recorded in the marvelous enriching acoustics of mono. After a shoot out and car chase with the terminator Conner is brought up to speed on her predicament. Both are then captured by the cops.The cops have very little time to sort things out before lugnuts shows up for some drive thru. After mowing through and entire department , the chase resumes. This is the area of the film where Sarah and Kyle fall in love though even 2017 most die hard fans of the movie admit how that happened is over their heads. Maybe , getting pregnant by a guy you have known for 60 minutes whilst being hunted by the Mobile version of CORTANA was hot for women back then who knows.After , their "" romance "" , the machine finds them at their no star motel and it's back to business as usual. After a round of explosions and car crashes , pretty cut rate at the time as well , they blow up the bad guy. It must have really burned to see it walk out after being killed. Anyway as the computer killer robot hunts our two heroes they decide hiding in a computer factory is their best bet. Nothing like giving your opponent home court advantage to turn the tide in your favor. Either way the machines mission objectives are finally ...crushed.So you have read this and are thinking OK , cheap budget effects it's the 80's. The plot is coherent and the acting not too shabby with a pretty good cast for its day. What gives bro?Simple logic. The movie is not the movie it could be. In the DVD release of this film there are deleted scenes . In one of these scenes Sarah and Kyle are at some stopping point on their journey and Sarah points out to Kyle that she has found the address of the computer company responsible for the creation of the system in the first place. Why not blow it up , and skip the whole thing? Because then we could not have several pointless sequels , another of which commits the same act only for us to receive more pointless sequels. I guess it is all you could expect from the guy that gave you Rambo.These people act like all they care about is money and the quality of their work is secondary. Completely inexcusable.",The Terminator
695,trvevang,I really wanted to like this movie. Sadly I didn't find i as good as I thought it was going to be.,6,16 January 2018,"So, The Terminator. A classic movie that mostly everyone liked. I didn't find it as entertaining. Now, this is just my personal opinion.I will start with the bad things:
Acting was (I'm sorry) poor at times, same with dialogue. I know this movie came out in 1984, but the effects were outdated and on level with early 70s movies. Story, a little simple. Good things:
To me, the music for movies plays a big role because how fond I am of film-music. And I found the music creative and a bit good in this film! It had much entertainment and actually GREAT QUOTES! I easily see why people love this film.
But it gets a 6.5 from me.",The Terminator
696,ShanoHepworth,The Best Terminator Film,10,13 May 2019,"The first Terminator film is not only one of my best films but its also my best in the whole Terminator Universe. The story is in the future a man would be born and will become the leader of a bunch of humans who are in a war with machines, his name is John Connor, knowing his importance Skynet a computer defense system becomes self aware and creates Terminators... an artificial intelligence in human form surrounded by living tissue but is infact a machine. This film a resistance soldier Kyle Reese played by a favorite actor of mine Michael Biehn is sent back to the year 1984 to protect Sarah Connor who is the mother of the futures only hope John Connor. The film is action packed as a man fights machine. What I love about this film is it has so many messages engraved within the storyline... just imagine some guy youve never seen before in your life arriving before your eyes telling you that the end of the world is near and that Machines are going to take over and that he's from the future.But from Reese's perspective he doesnt want to sound crazy telling Sarah all this without sounding crazy and he cant act like he knows her but in reality hes from the future which means he does infact know Sarah hes just timetraveled to they havent met yet but now they are forced together in order to survive a machine threatening to kill Sarah before she can conceive her son John Connor.",The Terminator
697,Robman9000,Not Cameron's Peak,10,18 September 1999,"I am a big fan of James Cameron.  Aliens was probably the scariest Sci-Fi movie ever made.  The Abyss was one of the most amazing films I have ever seen.  Terminator 2 was a fantastic blend of special effects and action. The original Terminator is a B movie that really shows its age.Everything about the movie screams, ""I CAME FROM THE '80'S!""  The characters are all generic '80's characters, the dialogue uses language popular in the '80's, even the future seems '80's with the remarkably bad techno/MIDI music.The plot is basically a copy of Halloween, which a lot of '80's movies were: Indestructible thing attacking female lead.  It keeps on dying and coming back to life, just like in Halloween.  I should mention that Halloween also doesn't show its age and is a much better movie.I guess everyone likes it for the effects, which were pretty cool, but not enough to recommend the movie.See the sequel.I gave this a 4 out of 10.",The Terminator

When I first saw it and checked the year of the film and saw it to be 1984 I was gobsmacked and I thought to myself. ""Woah this film is seriously ahead of its time."" And it truly was. The plot itself has everything action, love, suspense, emotion and a great ending. The acting is first class aswell with superb displays from Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Michael Bhien as Kyle Reese and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator which began an oddessy of action films for the Austrian star. As for the storyline its out of this world and is surely Cameron's brainchild. As for the premise Kyle Reese and the Terminator have been sent from the future with two different objectives, the terminator's is to kill Sarah Connor so that her unborn, unconcieved son John Connor never sees light of day. Reese's is to protect Sarah from the Terminator. Who is John Connor? John Connor is the leader of a human resistance that fights against an uprising by enhanced machines after a nuclear bomb launched onto LA.

709,davine-371-641417,"Possibly awesome at time, but nearly 40 years later?",7,31 March 2020,"My take from this was a film that's key draw is the cinematic experience and thrill of the chase of being chased down by a futuristic cyborg. Like many things though, the cgi ages massively, even if that's an unfair criticism to make (though star wars earlier than this, shows it doesnt need to be the case). Towards the end sequence, this really shows.Only thing I'd say is the protagonists arent the most likeable characters, so it makes it a little bit harder to root for them which is I guess the aim of the narrative.But overall it's an enjoyable and simple hollywood watch, and sure it would have been even greater at the time.",The Terminator

712,bchristopherwarne,the perfect action flick!,10,4 October 2013,"Possibly James Cameron's best film (only T2 comes close!), and also responsible for launching the A list career of Arnold Schwarzenegger....as a pure action film this is simply perfection!Superbly paced, lean and mean, relying on a terse script and superbly edited action scenes to up the tension as opposed to special effects- though effective, due to the budget they were very sparingly used (when was the last time you could say THAT about a Jim Cameron movie??). Also, for the first and last time we get to see Arnie playing bad- REALLY bad!- and although I love the humour of his ""good"" terminator in number 2, and even 3....there's something uniquely chilling about him as the villain.It's hard to believe this film is nearly 30 years old- it knocks 95% of modern action films out of the park (someone tell me with a straight face they prefer The Expendables lol), and aside from the occasional inevitable dodgy special effect- the eye scene springs to mind- it has aged amazingly well. Simply brilliant!",The Terminator
713,SmithWinston,More than meets the eye,10,31 May 2005,"For me this will always be the best of the Terminator films. The second is a great action film, the third is a popcorn flick. But this, the first of them, covers everything that the premise promises. The future, the present, and the strangeness of the laws that might govern time-travel (if it were at all possible). Kyle Reese is a great protagonist alongside Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. She is very natural and her reactions to the situation she finds herself in are spot on. Biehn's Reese comes off very well too, his calm and collected behaviour in the face of the Terminator shows how much he must be used to such a menace in the time he comes from.The action in the police station is justifiably legendary. The fact that Arnold's Terminator doesn't break a sweat when breaking into the well-guarded police headquarters and killing so many officers, really manages to drive home the point of what the terminator is. That's in case Reese's previous explanations about the machine didn't convince you. Lance Henriksen turns in a great performance as a real oddball of a character, just over-the-top enough to be plausible. Adding to the realism, this comic relief is taken out during the shoot-out at the police station. Just goes to show that no one is safe from the Terminator.Like Blade Runner, it's surprising how much better executed this film is compared to the CGI-fests that have taken over the cinema nowadays. The oldies hold up incredibly well in the comparison. The sparse scenes depicting the future are well-handled and the sets in no way detract from the authenticity generated. This film just oozes atmosphere, with it's bluish lights, dark future, and dark streets of the present with tube lights everywhere that throw long shadows. And of course Brad Fiedel's minimalist electronic score captures the mood and everything else perfectly. The musical motifs for the unstoppable terminator and the comparably feeble resistance offered by Reese are all present even in the main theme. I for one never get tired of hearing the same tune repeated throughout the movie, which at one point manages to morph into the love theme.It's a shame that Cameron didn't stick to making such films as this and Aliens (which is almost as entertaining, though for very different reasons). Titanic, which set out to be a romance, fell far short of it because it was the romance aspect that felt staged throughout. With the Terminator, James Cameron achieves a great balance between menacing action, a believable romance and comedic timing. Perhaps he should return to making films that don't aim for a love story, but end up having one as a by-product. Let's hope we can all put the disaster that was the Titanic behind us and look forward to films of a similar calibre to his earlier works. Regardless of whatever else he does, I'll always be grateful to him for the first of the Terminator movies.",The Terminator

I liked the entire trilogy a lot, but there's no comparing to this first one. It's a brainless action film, but it's not entirely brainless. Excellent world building makes it fascinating to explore, and begs for the two sequels.Even though it is sort of over the top in all of the action, it's just a really fun movie to see.

715,partypooper-1,A treatise on the economic struggles of California in the early 2000s,8,29 March 2014,"It was interesting upon viewing this movie for the 5th time while keeping in mind the struggles that California was going through when Arnold first took office. I saw Sarah Connor as a Gray Davis figure, one who was unfairly hunted down by powerful enemies, for reasons out of her control. If you recall Gray Davis was the very unpopular governor of California during the electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001. He was unfairly blamed for the rolling blackouts in the state, when in fact Enron was to blame because they had a stranglehold on the power plants and were shutting them down, creating excess demand while diminishing the supply.The Terminator is Enron, a seemingly unstoppable force hellbent on the destruction of its enemies. Like Enron, The Terminator does not play by the rules; it does anything it can to complete its objective.But the powerful always fall. Enron flew too close to the sun and disintegrated when they could not keep up the facade any longer. The Terminator was destroyed when Sarah Connor lured him into a mechanical press. Although both Enron and The Terminator was defeated, the threat they posed still lingers. Corporate greed is still prevalent, as evidenced by the 2008 financial crisis. Banks and other financial institutions laid waste to the global economy, without sympathy for those whose lives they destroyed. The Terminator is a product of a future, possibly created by another, much more severe financial crisis that is looming over us. Terminators lay waste to everything, destroying the world and making it practically uninhabitable. If we do not learn from our mistakes, and continue to allow corporate greed to permeate throughout our society, big banks and the financial wizards of Wall Street will destroy this society without a second thought. Short-term profits always win out, without any regard for long-term sustainability.",The Terminator

This is one of the movies where I am impressed with Arnold... He plays his role almost PERFECT (hardly any lines, just a cold, rutheless killing-machine). And Linda plays her role exelently too.The movies has a lot of everything needed for a good action flick: lots of action, lots of explosions and lots of chasing/stalking (and a tad of love), but it manages to balance in the grey area between too much and too little, making this a true masterpiece.The story of a world overrun by 'borgs, using the few remaining ""fleshies"" as slaves can easily get boring, but this movie keeps the excitement up from beginning 'till end...

720,Lord Tal,One of the All Time Greats.,10,21 February 2000,"We all know the story, so i wont bore you on that. What i want to say is this, the Terminator is a timeless classic that is often overlooked due to its far poorer and yet far well known sequel that, from my point of view, should never have been created, if it were to be so infinitely inferior compared to The Terminator. The Terminator could well have just turned into a B-movie, but didnt. The great thing about it is how right from the start to the very end of the music (another brilliant thing about it), it has you at the edge of your seat, your attention never waivers, and no matter how many times you watch it, it just gets better and better. The music is, to put it bluntly, almost the best. The only music in a film that is better is that of The Last of the Mohicans. From my point of view, the music of a film is more important than the dialogue and visuals of a film, and after the first time i watched The Terminator, that music has stuck in my mind ever since (and im glad for it !). The other reasons that The Terminator is so good is its characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his very best in this film, and i still think he has never managed to top this performace. Granted, he said less than 100 words or something, but that doesnt matter. The music and his actions when he was on screen defied any dialogue, and the less he talked, the better he was. The scene in the technoir club and the Police Station ""incident"" are two of the greatest scenes ever. Linda Hamilton was brilliant as the innocent waitress who's boring every day life, being continuously stood-up, suddenly turns into the most important living being on earth. Finally, there is Michael Biehn. Now i thought that Linda should have been catapulted into super stardom, when she wasnt, but Michael Biehns' luck in Hollywood is evan worse. He pulls off a performance that i dont think any other actor could have done. From my point of view, he was perfect. He had the greatest lines and the best character in all the film. You can really feel pity for this guy to say the least, as he seems so small compared to the massive bulk of Arnold, and yet just as Arnold keeps on getting up after being shot up, for a human, Riece does very well, showing the urgency and importance of his misson, as he must succeed. Michael Biehn gets no where near enough credit for this film, and instead of being in the Hollywood A List, hes way down the line. When it came out in the Cinemas', i watched The Rock, it had Sean Connery and Michael Biehn in it, i thought that both of them would have pivotal parts, and was hugely disappointed too see him die almost immediately after less time on screen than Ray Parkes in TPM. This guy really has been literally dumped on. Finally, James Cameron, for a guy who made the most expensive film ever, i have one piece of advice, get back to low budgets, cause this is the best film you've ever made and are ever likely to make. So, in conclusion, if anybody out there hasnt watched this film, watch it, its one of the best.",The Terminator

The story is the most beautiful story ever written.The cast member (from Arnie to the last extra) is made of gold. Why? 'Cos they made a new legend. The same way that Ford Coppola made his ""Godfather"" Jim Cameron create the new feeling about human life, love and the relations between people. How many cost human life? It could cost a lot or, in other hand, nothing ( a micro-sec, like Resee told in the first part) Really why do we cry? Neither ourself can reply to this question.This part is the beginning of a legend: Sarah Connor, my hero. I always will wanted to be like her. It could be that this film was considered as B series, but there are so many reasons to consider it as a great film.First of all they create a new visual effects: Animatronics, which have been used in so many films. And the best scene i even seen was when Sarah is waiting to a police in a disco in Pico Blv. and the Terminator is searching her. But just when the Terminator pass by the side of Sarah she goes down to catch a bottle she dropped. And when she returns to sit, she crosses the look with Resee.Some many People used to critic that if Resee is the Jonh's father why doesn't change the future? In fact all memories about Jonh Connor should change isn't it? But, anyways this film is for me a gift. Thanks 4 all Mr Cameron.",The Terminator
724,jcf30,Compelling. Utterly.,9,6 February 2002,"The ultimate success of Terminator is based on the casting of Schwarzenegger. Everybody knows that; and just a quick glance through the comments of IMDB users is enough to convince anyone that that is the majority view. But why? Surely any hulking brute could have filled the role just as amply? Answer - no. Arnie wasn't just born to play a cyborg because he had a pneumatic physique. On the contrary, it's his robotic austrian grasp of English, his total physical stiffness, and his face redolent of a Barbie Doll ""Ken"" on anabolic steroids that do it. In 1986, the real Arnie was little more than an android himself - so unwieldy that he'd had to tone down his workout for 'Conan' simply so as to be able to swing a sword comfortably. It's one reason why the play's most grating 'special effect' (the moquette head used to conduct the eye operation) paradoxically doesn't grate that much: it may look like bad Harryhausen; but then again so does Schwarzenegger.The film's other major selling-point is its gritty reality. Terminator had low production values; and the result is a city and characters that don't look like they've been made up to look normal, but just convince naturally. Lance Henirksen, Paul Winfield and Earl Boen do a great job as fatigued, bored, caffeine/nicotine dependent middle-rankers caught up in something which they simply do not understand until it's far too late. The fact that the film only depicts the future post-apocalypse in the odd isolated scene or two (which really don't do anything for the film apart from make the limitations of its budget that bit more noticeable) keeps it firmly seated in the 80s. Someone said that the 80s are now more alien to us than a mesolithic culture. I don't agree with that in the slightest; but I vaguely see what he's getting at when I see 80s LA in Terminator; though familiar, it's cold, unfriendly, and deeply threatening. The 'First Encounter' sequence in the night-club builds up an almost unbearable sense of tension with its muffled background acoustic rock, the blood-red disco lighting, and the slow-motion photography, which suddenly explodes into full-speed, frenetic action, and the audience's terror, pent up for a good twenty minutes or more, gets a chance to release itself as Michael Biehn blasts Arnie out through the window with his shotgun, each volley almost prompting a relieved scream of encouragement mixed with fear from the viewer.
Everything else slots into place very nicely: the music is brooding and, as someone else rightly puts it lower down, primitive in a mechanical way; reflecting the Terminator's quasi-primal relentlessness. Unlike T2, none of the action sequences look contrived; the sequel has a tendency to lose itself up its own sphincter with John-Woo style shots; cf Arnie's boot trampling the rose bouquet in slo-mo in the shopping mall. T1 has none of this. It is exciting, yet somehow faintly believable. There is no attempt to make the camera-work 'speak' in any way: the director is simply content to let the camera rest on the Terminator, who speaks well enough for himself. Add in the odd bit of black humour (""you're dead, honey"", quips Sarah's work chum as they view the news of the Terminator's first strike on TV) and you have an extremely compelling film. I defy anyone to watch the first ten minutes and not sit through the rest. The whole premise of the Terminator's invincibility leaves us on tenterhooks throughout, wondering how the hell he CAN be stopped. The sense of relief when it eventually succumbs is overwhelming, and postively catharthic.",The Terminator

728,brianwalker-341-207399,"Relentless, heartless",8,24 July 2017,"Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman. That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to ""get on your feet, soldier."" She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous. And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.It's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me. It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart. It's quickly developing love story touches me. Its humor makes the dark places in me smile. But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation. As a good life exercise, ask yourself this: Would you have the courage to do what she does?",The Terminator
729,deano107-1,Fantastic,10,18 July 2006,"Listen. And understand. That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.

With him dead, the machines have won. They MUST erase is existence....John sends human kyle Reese back in time to protect is mother.In my opinion this has got to be one of the best Sci fi films of all time, if not the best. Great action, story which moves at lightning pace, great acting, and brilliant soundtrack by brad Fidel. some of the sfx don't hold up to well today, but hey..it was 1984 and to be fair they was pretty groovy. Stan Winston in charge of the effects.the chase scenes are intense!! Arnie nails the role of the unstoppable cyborg, he is truly scary and his destruction of the police station only proves the fact that Sarah and kyle are safe nowhere from this machine.

Though only a few things disappointed me with this one, i wasn't really impressed by kyle Reece's character i just never really got into him and Sarah was OK but she didn't really impress me either but she really really improved on that in the second one...but this was a great entry into the terminator franchise and i was quite impressed.

731,miyagigoose,Possibly Arnolds best role...way better than robocop,10,16 April 2005,"i wont write up the story due to the fact its on the main page..I love this movie i think its bar far the best of the three and have seen it many times, i also own the new remastered DVD and noticed some of the gunshot sounds have been changed and think that they sound awful and don't match the weapon whatsoever i personally think they sounded better originally my friend who also owns this said the very same thing to me, and i think most people will agree i wonder who was responsible for it because they want shooting! i think this is Arnold's best role just due to the way he acts "" very robotic"" and suits the role perfectly and couldn't see it played by any other actor. Michael beihn who is also known for choosing not to play the main as he plays such a good part is awesome in this movie and i have looked for him in many other movies due to his performance in this, which is also brilliant in aliens, another favourite movie of mine....terminator two was also very good because it has the right kind of humour in it, whereas when i watch the third instalment i think of it as ""seperate"" from the other two as you cant take it seriously and i think that really spoils what could have been a slightly better movie, shame Cameron's didn't direct! a great movie that is definitely worth owning,",The Terminator
732,jacobhunt6,It's a neat blend of entertaining action and compelling sci-fi,8,18 August 2020,"For all that The Terminator offers in terms of a brilliant action antagonist, thrilling fight sequences and iconic quotes, it also offers a narrative that gives a great deal of satisfaction.First and foremost, this is the perfect role for Arnie. As wonderful as he is in terms of his overbearing figure and incredible athleticism, emoting has never been Schwarzenegger's strong point. So, Cameron put him in a role devoid of emotion, where he can loom as a cold, heartless and intimidating antagonist. It is no wonder that this is the ultimate Arnie role - it was basically written for him, and I could not possibly praise his performance enough. He is genuinely frightening as a villain.But beyond the icon that The Terminator has become, the story also feels right. While it's definitely one of the greatest sci-fi and action films of its time, it's a lot more than that, too. It sets itself up well, paces itself nicely, and gives a good pay-off at its conclusion with a lot more detail than you would expect. Cameron's attention to detail and imaginative world-building are tremendous, and it's among his best work for sure.As would be expected from a film made in the 1980s, a few of the visual effects are getting old enough to begin to break immersion (namely the animation of the Terminator's robotic body), but by the time those come into play, The Terminator has you hook, line and sinker. It's a fast-paced and intelligent story littered with intensity and the brilliance of Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best.8 out of 10, expect to love it whether you're a fan of action films or want something with a little more narrative complexity.",The Terminator

I know some people like T2 more but to me, this is the definitive movie that laid the foundation for all 80s sci-fi and 90s thriller movies after it.From the starting future sequence with the hunter-killers, we are brought into a world we have rarely seen in movies. It still surprises me how Jim Cameron and the rest of the production crew managed to pull the special effects off. Anyways, this future sequence is just a preview of the darkness and entertainment this movie is about to bring to the screen.As soon as Arnold shows up doing the terminator pose, and uses classic Arnold one-liners to get some clothes from some punk guys, you immediately realize you're in for a ride.Michael Biehn does a great job playing Kyle Reese, I cannot imagine anyone else playing him. Linda Hamilton does a wonder playing Sarah Connor, and shows how an average woman living a casual life can change into a fight-for-your-life Rambo type gal.Overall, with stellar acting and directing, an insanely good plot and how-did-they-do-that special effects, this movie gets a 10/10 from me.Oh and also, don't forget, 'I'll be back' - insert Austrian accent.",The Terminator

743,discsint,Insights into The Terminator *** SPOILERS ABUNDANT ***,10,30 December 2001,"WARNING: I will be going into the plot in great detail, so if you haven't seen the film, please do not read this, it will spoil your first experience.Having said that, I regret not being able to see this movie for the first time again. Seeing how you're still reading this, I'm assuming you've seen the film. So I won't have to tell you that it's a gritty horror film rather than the action movie which is the second installment, or that it's far superior in plot.Personally I regret the fact that the film opens with a brief plot outline. I would have preferred it if the film would have just explained this along the way, but that's my only gripe.This has to be one of the best science fiction/horror movies of all time. A real classic. Though the aforementioned outline tells us there is a terminator and a protector, you don't know which is which (even though it's pretty easy to guess). Furthermore, it's never mentioned that the Terminator is a machine. If you would look at this film with a sceptical, yet open, mind, you'll get one of the best first film-experiences ever. Assuming that you don't know what the Terminator is, you'll see it do things that are just not logical. This guy is being gunned down in a bar, but manages to stand up again. What is going on here. It's not until after this scene, that you'll get a Terminator Point of View (POV) which explains we're not dealing with a man, but with a machine. Later in the movie, after Kyle Reese has explained that the Terminator doesn't feel pain, you'll see it limping after being run down by a truck. If the Terminator doesn't feel pain, then why is it limping. Again this is explained later, when the flesh is burnt off, and you see it sustained damage to the foot mechanics. It's stuff like this that I live for.Next, and I think this is the most important part, is the magnificent elliptic storytelling. This is easiest explained if we start in 2029. SkyNet is on the verge of losing the war, and sends back a Terminator to kill the mother of the leader of the resistance, John Connor, before he is born. In order to protect her, a protector is sent after the Terminator: Sergeant Kyle Reese. Ultimately Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fall in love, make love, and Sarah becomes pregnant of John Connor. Thinking this thing through: If SkyNet hadn't sent a Terminator back through time, Kyle Reese wouldn't have been sent, John Connor wouldn't have been born, there wouldn't have been a resistance and SkyNet would have won. Which means there basically is no beginning, unlike for instance in Back To The Future, where the past is altered which has it's effects on the present. Though the Terminator has been sent back in time to alter the course of history, all it really does is perpetuate it. (Twelve Monkeys worked according to the same principle). There is still the implication that your actions shape the future, but that changing the course of history is impossible, since changing the past will create the present that is.Accuracy is also one of the strong points of the film. After Sarah has completed a plastic explosive device, Reese mentions ""Six more of those and we'll be done"". Counting the number of bombs used you will notice that only 7 bombs are being thrown. Having been in the army for 2 years with the Uzi as a personal weapon, I can tell you that there's a maximum of 30 rounds that go into the clip (actually 32, but to prevent jamming 30 is the maximum). If you would count the number of rounds being fired before the Uzi must be reloaded, you'll find that no more than 30 rounds are fired (unlike for instance Red Heat, where Schwarzenegger fires 13 rounds from a Magnum.44 which only holds 6).Also the reality of the violence is magnificent. I love movies which portray violence for what it is: Horrible. Don't get me wrong, I like movies where you can cheer when a bad guy is shot, but I believe realistic movies to be superior (if you agree, you should check out Platoon and Schindler's List).Lastly, though there is a significant amount of terror, there's also some wonderful comic relief. The two police officers: ""That coffee is two hours cold."" ""Uhuh"" (takes a sip). ""I put a cigaret out in it."" Or the answering options the Terminator has when he's asked: ""Hey buddy, you got a dead cat in there."" which include ""Yes"", ""No"", ""Go away"", and ""Please come back later"" until he finally selects ""F*** you, a**hole.""All in all a true classic in every sense. An absolute must see.Rating 10 out of 10",The Terminator
744,jake_carson,Michael Biehn is one of the greatest actors in the world,10,11 July 2007,"This isn't really about The Terminator as much as its star. Not Arnold ""The Governor"" Schwarzenegger, but Michael Biehn. If there is an actor who is less appreciated for his work, then i don't know as much about cinema as I thought. He is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors of all time, but he hits a peak in James Cameron's 1984 film ""The Terminator"". From the moment when he first steals that tramp's pants to his heroic death, he acts with a degree of intensity and skill that is rarely seen in film today. True, the rest of the cast are fantastic, and the script and direction are basically perfect, but for me the highlight of this film will always be Michael Biehn.

What I remember thinking was ""this is good, but the sequel is definitely better"". Well, spank me. It's not that I for sure can tell which of these is the best, but Cameron has that strange gift to make a sequel that switch genre, but still keeping the top quality. If Judgment day is a Punch-In-The-Face-Action Flick, then The Terminator is a chilling classic thriller with some great, but never over the top action scenes.The development of Sarah feels believable, even though it all only occurs during one night. It 's like the same transformation Luke Skywalker goes through, but packed into 1h 50m without feeling rushed. Impressive screen writing. Kyle is also a great character, even though he doesn't change during the story. His function is to save Sarah, while trying to convince her about what he knows.The acting is great to, this is exactly how far Arnie can act without exposing his non existing talent. What's strange is that this movie didn't rocket lauch Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn's careers. I know Hamilton did the popular ""Beuty and the beast"" show, and Biehn kept getting work from Cameron, but I mean Big Time Superstars. I see Julia Roberts/Brad Pitt potential when I see this film...

I thought the next 2 sequels were just as good although Arnie now plays a goody even though he was a baddie in the 1st one. Cannot wait to see Terminator Salvation even though he isn't to star in it and it's disappointing that they killed Sarah Connor off before the 3rd film came out, she was one of the best characters and should have been kept in it. I'm not a big fan of the TV series but it is watchable, even though it's hardly like the film, the character Derek (Kyle Reese's brother) they were meant to have grew up after the war but you see that he is covered in tattoos. Did a tattoo parlour remain standing after the bombs went off?

748,Big_Bright_Green_Movie_Machine,"In the year 1984, a classic was made. Like no other, this was ""The Terminator""",9,9 July 2011,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, what can you say of the man? He has appeared in the worst of the worst, yet he slowly climbed to fame. His most memorable franchise is no doubt ""The Terminator"" franchise. The film is directed by James Cameron and he truly brings the screen to life. You can feel what the characters are feeling. Fear, excitement, and hope.The films soundtrack is also the most fitting soundtrack for a movie besides ""The Graduate"" soundtrack. It's a dark soundtrack just like the movie. The film takes place in 1984, where Kyle Reese travels back in time to save Sarah Conner from a future machine. A improbable relationship blossoms between Reese and Sarah as they battle the machine. I don't want to give away and plot twists, so I won't go into any more detail. The action is awesome, and the effects are way ahead of its time.This sci-fi film is on par with Star Wars. ""The Terminator"" has its little charm that no other film will ever have. Not even its sequels. Although ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is perhaps even better than the 1st movie. I am aware of the T.V. show, I have seen several episodes and the show does not even come close to this film. If you don't have this movie, you need to close your browser, use the most convenient transportation device, ride to your local video store. Find the film and take it to the cashier.

750,paddymeharg,The unstoppable cult icon.,9,15 June 2012,"Schwarzenegger; love him or hate him you have to give him credit for knowing what he is and what he isn't. He knows his acting presence is never going to be mentioned with the same breathless awe of Meryl Streep. Arnie does a great job of choosing roles that suit him perfectly. One of those roles is the near monk-like silence of the cult classic killing machine known as the Terminator. We can overlook the fact that Skynet chose to send back a Terminator with a heavy Austrian accent to 1980's America because over the twenty or so times I have seen this film I really could not care less. This is probably Schwarzenegger's greatest film. The role doesn't ask too much of him and he plays it perfectly. As soon as Arnie is teleported, crouching fully naked beside a dump truck he is the Terminator. Many people would demean him, claiming it only works because he cannot act. I disagree. Acting is making the viewer believe and whilst watching this film you don't see former Mr Universe, you see an unstoppable cyborg killer would will not stop and not rest until he has completed his task. What works for The Terminator is the simple premise and James Cameron's ability to put a new spin on something we've seen before. He did it with Alien and like it or not he did it with Avatar. The rules of time travel are well worked out and simply explained. Nothing dead can travel back in time (Hence why we get treated to Arnie and Michael Biehn's buttocks at the start of the film). The Terminator itself cheats this rule by being living organism over metal skeleton. Perhaps most striking about this film, given that it was made in the action hero 1980s where machine gun wielding bodybuilders was the norm, is that the hero character is female. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now an icon. She's not the atypical screaming woman who's running up the stairs instead of out the door. She's a normal woman, working part time at a diner, living with a roommate and struggling to find a boyfriend that isn't more concerned about his car. When the time comes, she steps up to the demands of the film. She never thought she could be a hero or brave or fight a cyborg from the future but she does all of these things and the film is really about her and her journey. Much of the colour and explanation comes from the haunted but utterly devoted Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who successfully balances the forlornness of the future with his love for Sarah and determined resolve to protect her. He is the underdog in this fight and it's hard not to root for someone so passionate. A supporting cast of Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen and Earl Boen as the psychiatrist add a light-heartiness to a very bleak and depressing environment. It works. Cameron's direction and pacing transition well between visions of a possible future and the unravelling present. There is a reason this film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry a requisite being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant'. The Terminator is all these things. It is a film that has referenced and inspired so many others and if it's not on your list of films to watch before you die, then you are a fool.",The Terminator

Is supposed that he come back in time to save her for their baby... so the first time what!? 2) Yeah, I buy the lack of people in the streets and the factory.3) Now she knows exactly what button press to kill the terminator in the factory? 4) WHY THE SEX!? IS SO FORCED!

752,Shantell_sabbar,James Cameron. An Auteur?,7,8 October 2012,"When watching a James Cameron film if you didn't know he directed it, you wouldn't guess. He doesn't exactly have the complete directive control on all of his films. He doesn't stick to the same genre; although no matter what genre his film is there is always a strong aspect of love and it isn't always romance. There is however some similarities within the films he has directed. Firstly, he has a large budget when it comes to making the film. Identifying the budget; Aliens was around $18,500,000; Titanic at $200,000,000, and a more recent film being Avatar at $237,000,000. Two top box office films were also both made by James Cameron so he is making a huge profit on what he is putting into the film. It could be argued that James Cameron is an auteur when it comes to money in terms of the budget and the profits. Secondly, there is always an aspect of strong love within his films. In both The Terminator, and Aliens the human forms a relationship with the non-human species although that same species within each film is shown to be bad. In Terminator the viewer witnesses a strong love between the robot and the boy almost like a father and son relationship although the enemy is also a robot. In Aliens, although it is a horror and the aliens are the enemy there is a scene where Ripley has no choice but to kill the alien to survive but it is quite emotional as there is a bond between this alien and herself. In both of the above films the non-human species is shown to be good and bad. It changes with Avatar. A human and a Na'vi fall in love, and instead of one of the non-human species being the enemy, the human is. Which takes the film from another perspective but it still shows a strong love within this film. Although not as obvious as another director such as Tim Burton for example, James Cameron could still be perceived as an Auteur in the ways mentioned above.",The Terminator
753,patrick-bracegirdle1,Good but overrated,6,5 January 2014,"This is one of the few examples of a film where Arnold Schwarzenegger pulls of a good performance, as an emotionless cyborg. And that isn't sarcasm I really mean Arnie pulls off an excellent performance. The film is essentially divided into two sections. One is where Arnie's T-800 goes on a LA wide killing spree, which is the best part. The second section on the other hand is packed with Jim Cameronesque preachy symbolism and dull to lifeless performances by supporting characters. The epicentre of this A bomb of underacting is Michael Biehn's dreadful performance as Kyle Reese. Biehn joins Hayden Christiansen and Ahmed Best in my personal collection of terrible performances in a sci-fi film. He seems to have an emotionless quality to his acting that makes half of the film unbearable. Apart from that, the film is brilliant and I thoroughly recommend seeing it.",The Terminator
754,sunny_jim9,Classic Future Technology,10,25 January 2007,"This was a film set before Arnold Schwarzenegger hit the big time, however we can see from his performance in this that it was well deserved. This was one of SChwarzenegger's rare performances as a villain and it was played brilliantly. This film was very low-budget however with the superb performances by Schwarzenegger, Biehn and Hamilton and the classy and stylish directing by James Cameron (A enormous career booster) this film becomes an instant classic. The film opens with a glimpse at the way the world has become in the year 2029 with all of Los Angeles being a nuclear mess run by the highly sophisticated machines known as terminators. The audience is the shifted back to 1984 where both the terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) have been sent back through time. The Terminator is a bad-ass with a 'serious attitude problem' who approaches a couple of punks, beats them up and takes their clothes. Reese however finds it less easy to acquire some decent clothing, being chased by a couple of suspicious cops through an alley-way. Reese soon steals a gun off a cop and gets his clothes from a department store (with the pants being stolen by a destitute drunk). The next day, the Terminator and Reese go their separate ways, the terminator stealing several automatic weapons and looking up every ""Sarah Connor"" in the phone book, ready to do whatever it takes to kill all of them, only one being significant. Meanwhile, Reese is perfecting his gun, ready to protect the 3rd ""Sarah J. Connor"" from this terminator. After the terminator has killed the first two Connors he goes to kill the 3rd who fortunately has gone out for the evening. Sarah later realizes she is being followed by Reese and ducks into the nearest nightclub, 'tech noir' trying to blend into the crowd. Unfortunately this isn't even enough to stop the terminator and she is spotted. Reese also spots the terminator, blows him out a glass window and the two make a run for it. Non-stop action here on. This is very impressive for such a small budget, especially with some of the very impressive visual effects. Like most sci-fi films of this genre, it alludes to other works and was successfully sued by author Harlan Ellison for chunks being taken from two of his episodes of ""The Outer Limits"" in the 1960's. That however doesn't diminish this masterpiece. A notable performance by Schwarzenegger. Biehn shouldn't be forgotten either for his role as Reese with his superb acting skills and most significant character to the plot. 5/5",The Terminator
755,retrorenegade,Let's Cut The Chase: This Film Is Fantastic!,9,24 April 2016,"In order to properly appreciate The Terminator, you have to look at this film and take into consideration the budget that it was made on and the status of the director who created it. Before this film, James Cameron was not the king of the world like he was after Titanic and Avatar broke through. He was a person who very little people had faith in with a film idea that didn't go over very well among the top studios. And if you look at this film from a technical point of view, you can see that they were being conservative with the budget for a bizarre science fiction premise created by a struggling filmmaker who nobody really had much faith in. But in the end, it turned out to be a very good movie with real heart and soul, exciting and suspenseful action, an interesting if unlikely plot, and great performances from Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.But what about Arnold Schwarzenegger? Well, Arnold is unique in this film since he is not really a character in the traditional sense. He is more of an obstacle; a force of nature that cannot be stopped that haunts the protagonists with his fierce demeanor and acute focus on his main mission: to murder Sarah Connor. There is an intensity to his presence on-screen, no small part do to Brad Fiedel's excellent score which includes a foreboding metallic heartbeat every time the Terminator walks onto the scene. And fascinatingly enough, his ""character"" as the Terminator encompasses a very dark fantasy of man: the ability to do anything to anyone without any consequences or anyone being able to stop you.The movie hits all the right notes! It starts with a disastrous view of the future before jumping into a dark, disturbing view of the present, with the gritty, dirty streets of nighttime LA providing the perfect setting for a suspenseful chase between man and a murderous machine. It gives us a glimpse of lighthearted humanity as we see Sarah Connor, and ordinary young woman living her life as a normal person, before we are thrown into her nightmare as she finds herself stalked by an unknown assailant with an unknown cause. We feel sympathy for her as she finds herself not only in physical danger but facing the emotional crisis of having the responsibility of saving humanity in the future. And we feel for Kyle Reece, the soldier sent from the future to protect her against impossible odds, as we see him trying to operate in a world that he does not know after growing up in the wake of nuclear destruction. Even the minor characters feel real and human. The only thing ""wooden"" about the acting in the movie would be from Arnold himself, but that's okay because his character is supposed to be a lifeless, emotionless killing machine - and he excels at his role as the Terminator in that way.But despite how much I love this movie (I even love it more than Terminator 2: Judgement Day, believe it or not), I can't ignore the fact that certain elements of the film have not aged well at all! Chase scenes that were filmed and sped up to look faster, choppy stop-motion animations on the Terminator endoskeleton, and prosthetic animatronics with plastic skin are just a few examples of how this film shows its age and its low budget. Setbacks like this can take modern moviegoers out of the experience simply because a lot of the special effects look incredibly dated compared to other films, even films that came before this movie like Return of the Jedi. However, in the end, this film comes across as James Cameron's true labor of love. This isn't the blockbuster high-budget mega production Titanic or Avatar. This is the film that got his name well known among the movie-making industry. This was his equivalent to Spielberg's Jaws or Lucas' Star Wars: a film that was so hard to make, but you can see he poured his heart into, and it paid off! You have to respect something like that!Just watch this film! Do it! Do it now! Go! Leave this review and find a copy of The Terminator and watch it!",The Terminator

True Lies is stealing from La Totale! (French Movie). Avatar is stealing from Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas. Titanic is stealing from A Night to Remember (1958, a much better movie).

The changes from the beginning to end are very vast as well as subtle.  I never tire from watching it and I can probably quote the majority of the movie verbatim.

This is one of the most powerful, poignant, heart-wrenching love stories on film.  It was masterfully acted (Michael Biehn, especially, gives a stand-out performance) and executed by all.

Sarah Hamilton also gives the performance of her career and Arnold delivers an outstanding performance in the few memorable lines that he gives.

This was my first love of violent action movies after I saw others but in a more PG level like who framed roger rabbit and the empire strikes back. But even I saw R rated stuff like this, robocop and predator.In the 80's, no one coined as much catchphrases and kicked so much butt and killed many people like Arnold. Long before he was an old action star in the expendables, he was a hungry actor and after this, he will learn English and get muscular in commando.The first in a series of 6 chapters, follows Arnold
as the t800, a cold, emotionless, killer cyborg as he kills punks, some woman, wrecking havoc and Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton, a cute teenager working in a dead end job u til the news say that the fake Sarah connor died and her friend said, ""you're dead, honey""Later, the plot gets more tense as the other man from the future is Kyle reese, played by Michael biehn.I like the scene in a bar called tech noir and some music, which sounds like pat benatar, blasts In the night club. Then just as the t800 tries to shoot, Kyle shoots him and they escape and ran. Then car chases ensue and more mayhem appears. James Cameron knows how to make an action movie.The finale is cool as they battle the t800.Let me stop before I spoil it. The music of Brad friedel is a techno score with dark, depeche mode-like, synthesizer blasts and pounding drum machines.The first movie was a smash hit and begins the long running franchise. It also inspired the anime/cyberpunk craze with appleseed and ghost In the shell. The terminator is my go to action film one of the best of the 80's.",The Terminator

770,pikkadude,Still a damn fine movie nearly twenty years later.,10,12 February 2002,"Just caught yet another re-run of The Terminator on late night TV. Gotta say, this film still delivers the goods nearly twenty years after its release.Okay, so the 80's hairstyles and the god-awful fashion date it a little, and the story has been mimicked, plagurised and downright ripped-off dozens of times by now, but essentially this is still as lean and mean as it ever was.
In fact, when you compare both the original and the awesome sequel, T2, to the likes of The Matrix, this flick still reigns supreme as an astonishingly well-crafted (given the meagre budget) masterclass in how to marry complex exposition to unrelenting action, without resorting to flashy gimmickery or million dollar excesses.Director James Cameron's ability to deliver the movie's sometimes weighty exposition without slowing the plot down is still a joy to behold, and the performances endure as knockouts all round - you really can still identify and believe in Kyle and Sarah's plight.Yeah, I'll grant you that the effects work in the finale does look a little ropey, what with the advent of CGI, but even by today's standards, The Terminator is still a classic to be reckoned with, the technical effects work alone being near miraculous in their execution given the limited finances available.In an era of formulaic junk cramming the multiplexes in the name of entertainment, The Terminator is still simultaneously smart, thrilling and iconic. Now - how many of our recent 'blockbusters' could truly claim the same?",The Terminator
771,tdaddict99,"Fantastic movie, one of my favourites!",10,13 February 2009,"This contains Spoilers.The Terminator is one of those movies that was great for it's time. The special effects are quite outdated by todays standards, but I try to look past that and focus on the fact that for the time, it was good and it was acceptable. It must have been great to have seen this movie in the Cinemas back when it was released.The Terminator plot is, at heart, a simple one, but many twists usually make it more complex, thus make it more compelling to watch, in my opinion. It's typically about the Present and the Future. The main character in this movie is Sarah Connor, who leads a simple life, but is going to be thrust into a life she never anticipated and I'm sure never wanted to have happened to her. A terminator from the future is sent into the past to kill Sarah Connor, which in turn kills John Connor, her unborn child. John Connor leads the resistance in the future and ultimately leads Humankind to victory in the war against the machines. The humans, who found out that they sent a Terminator in the past to try and kill Sarah Connor, which will wipe John Connor from existence and mean that the Robots will win the war, send a human Soldier, Kyle Reece,, to protect Sarah.From then on, the movie gets interesting very fast. Unlike the sequels to this movie, this one is more violent and has a darker tone about it than the other movies have. In this movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator, like in the sequels, but this time he is bad, not good. It seems like a very slim chance that Sarah and Kyle can beat it, since it is two humans versing a machine, which is nearly indestructible (or would seem so if you were in a similar situation and tried everything against it). They eventually beat the Terminator, but not before Kyle Reece dies.One of the twists in this movie is that Kyle Reece is the father of John Connor, and when you think about it it gets very complex and still gets me thinking as to how it might be. This movie makes you think in a way, and it's a different kind of action movie, if you focus on the story that is and not just the guns and pretty explosions that occur occasionally.The music is pretty good. While not the best in terms of composing (it's very improvised therefore there are some times when some sounds do not sound right at all), it fits the movie. The use of synthesizers was a great touch, although at the time, synthesizers were prominent in most movies so it was kind of expected. Some of the music is upbeat, some of it a more darker tone and some of it is romantic, soft music, such as the Sex scene or for an upbeat scene, when Kyle is having a nightmare when he is in the future and is fighting versing the Machines.The movie is well done, and although some things might be quite outdated by todays standards, you should still check it out.",The Terminator
772,matt_cloke,The Terminator,9,16 April 2008,"If you really look at the film, you will notice that when comparred to T2 The Terminator is much more of a horror film whereas T2 has that family element with all three main characetrs bonding with each other as individuals. Also another thing is, that the terminator is a highly advanced machine that is powered by two hydrogen fuel cells, he also as extremely advanced analysing processors, he looks at a car and can get every single spec and info for it but when he searches for Sarah Connor in the phone book he has to scan the pages with his fingers. but overall the terminator is an excellent film, which will be remembered through out time",The Terminator
773,presbp-1,Terminator is a great action film but it is also one that makes you think. That is what makes it better than a standard action film.,9,16 April 2009,"While Terminator is a great action film, I was surprised and happy to see that James Cameron went to great lengths to give the film a soul as well. I was glad to see that there is actually character development in the film and that the characters weren't stamped ""helpless woman"", ""hero"", ""villain"". I was also very pleased that James Cameron made a conscientious effort to include minor details, that if not present in the film, would leave a few would-be plot holes in the story. The film, like most science fiction (or at least good science fiction appears to do), keeps us thinking about the implications of our use of technology.There are a couple instances where I perceived the dialogue to be corny, forced and/or unnecessary. There were also a couple instances where I felt as if suspension of reality was required. Granted this is a sci-fi action film those two things still seemed far-fetched.However, even though I had some minor issues with the film, the film was great. The film made me think, gave me an adrenaline rush and got me emotionally engaged in the events that were happening on screen. Perhaps I am exaggerating, but I feel as if it is rather rare that an action film has fairly good character development, makes you think or weaves the plot so well. I was thoroughly impressed.",The Terminator

This movie revolutionised action / Sci-fi films. Tell me how many films today contain evil machines and cyborgs that go around killing people? A lot.James Camerons ""The Terminator"" is a fast paced action packed chase that will have the audience on the edge of there seat, the real beauty around The Terminator is that its one of those movies you can watch over and over again.Michaule Biehn plays the heroic character ""Kyle Reese"" with great strength, you can really grow attached to the character.Finally Arnold Schwarzanegger plays the role of ""The Terminator T-800"" brilliantly, Arnold helped a lot towards the film making minor suggestions such as using his eyes like a surveillance camera, hes the thing that cant die in the nightmare that wont end!

776,jofredbekk,An Important Action Film,10,16 October 2010,"When it came out many people saw this film as a bad, low-budget B-move, and laughed at it. These people couldn't have felt very smart afterwords...The Terminator can be looked on two different ways: either it's a average sci-fi action film about a killer robot that goes on a killing spree, or it may be one of the best and deepest sci-fi movie ever made. I see it as the last one. Sure the action is great and Arnold as the terminator is just bad-ass. But I feel that it contains a message(or warning) that maybe technology moves at a speed that may cause it to harm us in the end. When you think about it, when this movie came out, many of the things in the movie seemed impossible. But now only 30 years later we are closing in on ""The Terminator"" future. In this age technology are used to make weapons more and more advanced, and we are already using robots on the battlefield(for example the predator drone).This makes me think, where will it stop (if ever), and will we in the end have made such powerful weapons that it exposes a threat to mankind... something to think about.I'll be back",The Terminator
777,Ash5150,Superb! An Excellent Beginning For An Excellent Director!,10,22 October 2003,"James Cameron's best, most original piece of work. Forget T2: Judgment Day (actually, it's great sequel to this great original), Titanic etc. The Terminator started it all, long before Cameron was sailing with Leonardo DiCaprio on that stupid love-boat. Forget every other Schwarzenegger movie, this one started it all. Arnold's best work yet! He was brilliant as this walking hunk of machinery, why? Because that's what he seems to be; a monstorous, mechanincal tyrant, a cold blooded killer. Michael Biehn defined the phrase ""action star."" He play Sgt. Kyle Reese like a flute, note for note. He plays his character with emotion, energy and depth, much better than most Hollywood ""action stars."" Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was just fine, I didn't find anything about her performance dazzling, but it was good. This movie is called The Terminator, but the stars of it are Reese and Connor. Without Reese, there was no story to the events taking place, without him, we'd have no idea about what was going on. And, like most movies, this one is about a girl, Sarah Connor, once the girl next door, a simple college student and part time waitress, who becomes wrapped up in the future in the making. Story summary: In the year 2029, machines, that humans built to serve them, have taken over, and now the humans either serve them, or fight against them. The leader of a Resistance force, John Connor, learns of the machines devious plot to kill him. The machines; Skynet, will send back their ultimate weapon; a highly advanced, cold-blooded killing machine, a Terminator. Skynet will send back a Terminator (Schwazenegger) to the year 1984, nine months before John Connor would be born, by killing his mother. John sends back the first volunteer to 1984 to protect her, Sgt. Kyle Reese. With Reese to protect her, teach her, and guide her, Sarah Connor must survive this ordeal, or the human race is doomed. The odds are not good, Reese with no modern weapons or help must protect Sarah, or die trying.Intelligent, original, and insightful film that would remain a classic to date. I rate it 9 out of 10 for a great story, wonderful acting, and superb directing. A good start for the up and coming James Cameron, the maker of Titanic-woopty friggin' doo, Titanic-Schmranic, The Terminator is without a doubt, much better.",The Terminator

779,samuel-castro,I'll Be Back!!,10,1 April 2012,"The ""Terminator"" was one of the best action films of all time, with the exception of it's sequel, and executed with a bunch of no name actors and a shoestring budget...not to mention a director with almost no experience, it's an amazing feat to say the least. It's been 28 years since it's release, and while some special effects have aged inevitably, the effect of the movie itself has not.Linda Hamilton, Arnold (I'm not even going to try and spell that last name), and especially, the cult following worthy Michael Biehn for his characters alone, all give good performances. The film has a few very minor flaws, but is not reflective onto the enjoyment or quality factor. The action and the story are all paced nicely, has excellent direction, the characters have are well developed, and the overall content is quite impressive. The movie is fairly simple, but is extremely effective. Terminator has been deemed a classic and respectfully so. I'm sure it will provide a great movie experience for myself and others for many years to come. The idea of a machine sent to kill you that is all but unstoppable, without any remorse or hesitation, is very chilling and is one of the film's main reasons for such success. I don't need to say any more, you've seen it. Needless to say, this film started many careers of those involved. Classic.An absolute must for any action or sci-fi fan's collection.",The Terminator

Linda Hamilton does a great job in the film. She doesn't over act her lines and the end of the film I felt she really outshone in the factory and leaving John her message. Michael Biehn also does a great performance and Arnold Schwarzenegger does a good job, he may of had very few lines but his physical acting is very well done. Schwarzenegger did a good job at portraying a cyborg with use of movements. The dream sequences in the film that go back and forth between the future and the present is amazing, gives it more of a chilling sense knowing that their future is full of hardship and turmoil.

Today there is too much special effects it's ridiculous. True this movie uses stop-motion animation but it doesn't even come close to LOTR or Jurassic Park. Yes this movies was made by Cameron but if you can look past that, then you will enjoy this movie. Now this movie is not as good as two but still is a classic hands down. This movie is even on 3 different AFI'S 100 Greatest lists. Now there is something to think about.Now for those of how who don't know the movie, here is a summary. It is 2029 and ""The Machines, Robots, or Cyborgs is mostly what they use in this movie,"" they are in a war with the human race. And Skynet, the people who build these things in factors that all look like robots, come up with a new cyborg called ""The Terminator."" This new Cyborg is made in a factory on an assembly line and they all look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. In this movie then send one terminator back in time to kill John Connor who is the leader of the humans. Then send him to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) his mother. But the human also send a solider named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn.) Who will win Arnold or Michael? You'll have to find out.This is a classic and I hope you see this movie real soon or if you have, I hope you are like the movie as much as I do.

I've got to say this that the producers thought that this movie isn't going to be a big hit. This blockbusters made Arni a big star. Linda Hamilton plays the mother of John Connor-future hero off the earth.Arni has been sent to earth to kill her. The resistance is aware of this fact and sent back to the year 1984 a man to protect Sarah Connor(Linda H.)-Michael Biehn. He is a normal human while Arni is a machine and much more powerful. By the way: they sent these machines back to the future in the year 2029. So M.Biehn falls in love with Sarah and so becomes the father of John. In a final battle Arni and Michael both die. The remains of the Terminator are shown in T-2 ....well this movie is just a great one!!...you must see it. And includes one of 6 great scenes in movies of all times....I am talking about the part when Arnie says: I'll be back..

Arnold Schwarzenegger is brilliant as the terrifying cyborg even though he doesn't have to say much in the film.He has come to teminatinate John Connor before he has even been born The main character is Michael Biehn who plays kyle Reece, he narrates the story to the audience and Linda Hamilton is good at the woman who's world has been turned upside down. the special affects are not that good now but at the time they were really good especially for the end scene between the terminator and Sarah Connor. if people liked this film they should definitely watch its sequel as it gets even better than the first!!",The Terminator

Anyways, this movie properly blew my brains out and splattered them on the wall, back in the day, And it still deserves nuff respek, surely? You've got your fancy CGI stuff and that, and of course in that (cutting his eye out scene, his head looks well plastic) but realism is only as real as the perception of the perceiver, surely.
Anyways, its a love story, that is told under very caotic situations. But that love made J. Connor.",The Terminator

795,moocus,One of my favorite Sci-Fi Films,10,8 July 2006,"THE TERMINATOR is about an almost invincible cyborg sent back to 1984 in order to terminate Sarah Connor, who will give birth to John Connor, leader of the human resistance in the year 2029. A man named Kyle Reese is sent back to protect Sarah from the powerful cyborg. When I first saw this, I thought to myself what a masterpiece. This is without any doubts, Arnold's best performance and most memorable one. Biehn and Hamilton also give impressive performances. I also liked the score. Very machine-like and flows perfectly with the terminator story. I have this film on DVD and I have seen it about 70 million times. I never get bored of THE TERMINATOR.

798,qhr-1,Terminator = Cinematic Perfection,10,18 September 2006,"James Cameron's 1984 low-budget blockbuster film The Terminator, one of the most popular movies of the 1980's, has become an American cinematic legend whose follow-up installments T2 and T3 continued to push the boundaries of action, suspense, and special effects. The success of the first film is due to many factors, primarily Cameron's cinematically efficient illustration of a tight story that he fills with powerful and iconic imagery frequently interspersed with dark humor.Following an ominous credit sequence perfectly paired with Brad Fiedel's metallic 13/8 score, the scene of the garbage truck and the dumpster immediately conveys Terminator's power and effect on its environment. Its flaming time-travel arrival, like the detonation of a nuclear blast, renders the truck useless and sends the terrified driver scurrying for cover (after uttering ""What the Hell--"" the identical ADR soundbite looped from his previous interior cab shot).The three punks at the Griffith Observatory are perfectly rendered. While horsing around with a coin-op telescope, Brian Thompson's character spots the approaching muscle-bound, completely nude Terminator and wonders, ""What's wrong with this picture?"" Bill Paxton's tire-tread facial tattoo and sneering opener ""Nice night for a walk,"" and Brad Rearden's guffaw and arm tap response, are potent character details. In T2, we learn that the T101's cpu is set to read-only since he's out alone. However, the conclusion of this exchange seems to display its capability as a ""learning computer;"" Paxton's obscene three-word rebuke to the cyborg's clothing request was later included in the Termo-vision response choices to the flophouse janitor's query, ""You got a dead cat in there, or what?"" Arnold's flat Austrian-flavored delivery dynamically reinforces the reality of the machine beneath the rotting flesh, functioning as designed despite its chronically damaged exterior. The scene in the gun shop, the deadly conclusion of which is obvious from the worm's eye POV of Arnold's entrance, is another example of humor and violence. After handling the AR-180, the Franchi SPAS 12-gauge auto-loader (you can go pump, or auto), the 45 long slide with laser sighting (that's a good gun), the T101 requests a ""phased plasma rifle in a 40-watt range,"" to which the salesman matter-of-factly replies, ""Hey, just what you see, pal"" as if he had simply asked for an illegal weapon like a rocket launcher. Or as if a secret code word would avail him to the shop's special selection of weaponry a la the white supremacist's private cache in Falling Down.Rising from Kyle's first volley of blasts in the nightclub, he kicks his firepower up a notch as he unleashes the Uzi. His deliberate, ""here-it-comes"" lock'n'load is a choreographed ballet of impending destruction, as seen from Sarah's POV. After being blown back through the glass, he rises from the sidewalk and begins chasing Kyle and Sarah, his pace accelerating steadily just like a machine. Or a hyper-alloy combat chassis, tersely described by wheel-gripping, teeth-baring Reese as ""microprocessor controlled, fully armored, very tough."" He then sums it all up for a dubious Sarah: ""That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!"" Classic.The nonchalance with which the T101 smashes the window of the station wagon, gets in and slams the door, and sends glass flying into his hair and face, is comical in its depiction of Terminator as a cold machine. As he pulls up to the curb in front of the first Sarah Connor's house, the front tire stops on and partially crushes a blue toy truck. Arnold the destroyer. Chasing Kyle and Sarah in the tanker truck, his red eye can be seen glowing from behind the cab's darkened windshield. He absolutely will not stop!The overwhelming brutality of the Terminator is most clearly displayed in the police station ""I'll be back"" scenes. Easily wielding the AR-180 with his right hand and the infamous Franchi auto-loader with his left, he marches through the corridors wasting everyone he sees (17 in all), complete with a flanged Termo-vision braaaaap! across the wall after a fleeing cop. In Cameron's ever-increasing display of force and destruction, Terminator wraps up the massacre by taking out detective Vukovich with half a dozen automatic rounds AND a shotgun blast.You might notice during that police station sequence a scene where the T101, back to the camera, swings the 12-gauge up with his left hand. When he pulls the trigger, they foleyed in (twice) an automatic-rifle burst instead of a shotgun blast. Another continuity issue: Reese saws off the stock of the shotgun and loudly racks it toward the camera. He wakes from the future-war nightmare in the car, and racks it again. No shell ejected? Then, in the night club, he whips it out from under his coat and does it one more time. Visual power trumps continuity. And it is exactly that frequent insertion of forceful imagery throughout Cameron's epic story that has made The Terminator one of the most memorable icons of 20th-century American cinema. -Ben Strout, 2006",The Terminator

Moreover, the movie is suspenseful, the score fits very well and the actors are just brilliant. Schwarzenegger was the perfect one for this role because of his physique, his charisma and his presence. Although the film was made in 1983, the special effects are amazing. Beyond that, the story gives you food-for-thought concerning robots and artificial intelligence. It's definitely a must watch to say the least and I do believe it deserves the title of masterpiece.

Arnold Schwarzenegger does the best role play what i know.Play the role of terminator. So brutal so cool. I just love this. James Cameron so think-full director. And the music of film is also nice. Even thought it is so 80's it rules. I think first Terminator is much darker than second one. But plot is very tight and not so humorous than second one. There is many memorable moments in this movie. When terminator goes in police station and first time says: I'll be back, and shooting on disco when Sarah is Resguet by Jonh's dad. Many old movies look ridiculous nowadays, but not this one.",The Terminator
808,nrobinson10,One of the best movies... OF ALL TIME.,10,28 February 2007,"This is, truly, one of the best movies of all time. Released in 1984, The Terminator has become an instant classic with critics, comedians, and die hard Schwarzenegger fans (such as myself). The opening scene, which is now considered legendary, starts out at 1:52am on a May morning, with an old man operating a fork lift, cursing when it won't work. Then comes the Terminator, Schwarzenegger's ultimate role, and the movie takes off. Featuring Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, and the masterful movie-maker James Camereon as director, this movie is no filler any way you look at it. Also it has some of the best movie scenes and quotes you'll ever see, like ""I'll be back,"" which has been slaughtered by comedians 'round the world. This film as an absolute MUST-HAVE, whether you're a Arnold fan or not. This movie will most likely be remembered 100 years after its release from 1984; it's already gone platinum twice after 23 years, and will most likely be released a third time as its 25-year anniversary. Truly legendary.",The Terminator
809,imida234,Wow!!!!!,9,25 January 2002,This film has to be the most terrifying film ever and it does not let up for the entire film. This film was also special for the leading man Arnold schwarzenegger (who absolutly laps up the role of the machine that wont die) as this was the film that made him a hollywood star.n Anyway back to the film as you my know arnold is the cyberdyne model 101 terminator who is sent back throught time to kill the mother of a future rebal leader John Conner because he is the one who can wipe out the machines existence. Also sent back through time is a lone warrior called Kyle Reese (played by Micheal Biehn) who has been sent to protect Sarah conner (played by Linda Hamilton). The plot moves at such a fast pace that the action move to fast to keep up with. Overall this has to to be my altime favourite film. 9/10,The Terminator

Great lines were born from this movie, such as ""I'll Be Back"", ""Come with me if you want to live"", and ""knee caps!"" Great performances by Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The finale is filled with amazing thrilling action, and will let you leave the movie satisfied wanting to be part of the future!",The Terminator
811,ujcsillag,In retrospect maybe terminator is what George Orwell had in mind about doublespeak,10,29 February 2008,"In 1984 I was 14 and reading George Orwell's novel titled 1984, written in the 1930's I think. I remember finding the book very thought-provoking and wondering about the agenda of world governments and covert agencies. The sign I was looking to confirm Orwell's predictions specifically was what was referred to as doublespeak especially by members of the government. That summer in 84 the U.S was in a military conflict with someone, I forget who now. When they attacked their enemies they ended up killing members of their own forces. It was the first public use of the words ""friendly fire"". After that I became somewhat obsessed with comparing what people said with what they obviously meant.Today re-reading the synopsis of Terminator (spoiler coming)I had a thought maybe the doublespeak referred to in the 1930's was foreknowledge of the future conflict where beings from the future would impact the events of the past for their own gain by exploiting real-time events that they had prior knowledge of. Specifically in the film the terminator imitates the voices of people to get information from people on the line who thought they were talking to their known companions. The doublespeak is the identity theft of the person's voices, later characteristics, now in real life real people's identities not just characters in a film are being stolen. In fact identity theft is the number one crime in North America now.Do any of you think the reason for the emergence of so many password dependent activities is a means for the humans(victims) to plan and disseminate counter-insurgency strategies without tipping off the time-travelers? I zealously create brutally encrypted dialogue electronically and in person just in case we actually do have a foothold situation going on.If this all sounds a bit too paranoid or far out just interpret this commentary as reflecting Terminator as being a really engaging provocative film that ideologically was really far ahead of it's time in its treatment of other-worldly anti-human conflict and how a disadvantaged species could overcome a superiorly prepared adversary by never giving in to despair and focusing on immediate survival needs with an eye to prophecy fulfillment.",The Terminator

814,aalataur,"Great, simply great",10,2 April 2006,"Well, what can I say. Simply the greatest action movie ever, and I've seen a LOT of them. I prefer it to T2, and any other Cameron film to that matter. It has more solid ""mood"" to it than T2, less commercial ""Terminator Action Figure"" -like. Harder, colder, bleak, dark and still full of emotion. I like the blue greenish color palette. I love the intensity and cohesiveness of the visuals. There's nothing to add, every frame counts. A brilliant plot, I like how the story unfolds during chase scenes. The story moves like a freight train. No scene could have been left out. Every shot and every line is perfect. Michael Biehn is great as a passionate soldier, who has seen no peace. He is always good as a soldier. I like so many things about it better than T2, which is also great sci-fi / action movie. Music is great, especially in the scene where Sarah and Reese escape from the police station. Gives me the chills every time. Also love the two 80's songs playing in the Tech Noir -club. Yeah, it's 80's movie and hair styles would make you laugh in any other movie. But in this one, they don't bother me. They are the only thing goofy about the film. Even Arnie fits the role. Terminator scanning environment while driving the police car, with burned eyebrows - great scene. Looks really machine -like. People always whine about the terminator FX in the final scenes. Why? They look great. Especially the closeup shots, scary stuff. The music is also awesome in this part, when Terminator lifts the door off for example... I love it, music goes hand in hand with every frame. Few sci-fi monsters look scary, but T-800 looks scary, the bleak stare and forever grinning teeth. Also, the movie is clever. It has something to say. About nukes and technology spreading everywhere. The time travel element in a plot always causes plot holes, 'cos time traveling is a paradox. In every time traveling movie there's plot holes, Terminator hides them well enough for a action flick.",The Terminator

There are not many action scenes,like todays blockbusters, but there are wonderfully made.

The special effects aren't much worse than we can do in this day and age, and the storyline is gripping.Its not as good as the sequels though, as Arnie is a much better good guy than an almost unstoppable baddie!Arnie's the man!And even though he plays near enough the same kind of guy every film he does, he always makes a great film!!!",The Terminator

They covered all the believability issues and had plausible explanations for everything which left me feeling as if it could some day come to pass. Great film! Arnold cast as a cold killing machine that rarely if ever speaks was the best use of his natural performing talent as will ever be chosen. He was simply awesome and not cheesy at all. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton were also really great. The ending of this movie was fantastic. The storm coming and the loneliness of it all for Sarah Connor.

Looking back the special effects weren't that great but at the time it seemed all too real. I think the second and third films lost their way in the sense that the 'baddies' weren't scary (with the exception of Robert Patricks eyes) and too much humour was injected.While the debates continue about Johns age throughout the trilogy, I'd just like to point out the other time ""mistake"" in case some of you aren't aware of it. At the start of the film it stats that it's L.A. 1984.

This movie was released in 1984, in the United States of America. It is a movie that contains scenes of action, adventure, fiction and much tension with a length of 107 minutes. The main actors of the cast are: Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator), Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor) and Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese). The legend has as plot the story of Sarah Connor as the leader of the human resistance to combat the killing machine (""The Terminator""), which is sent from the future to kill her, and she has as protector Kyle Reese, also sent from the future to protect her from the Terminator. Actress Linda Hamilton has done an extraordinary job in the movie, when she expressed with excellence the feelings of courage, determination and leadership of the legendary Sarah Connor. The Facial and body expressions of Linda Hamilton were appropriate to the moments of tension, action and suspense, when in confrontation with the killing machine. The performance of this actress was magnificent. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the ideal actor to perform the killing machine because of your physical characteristics (strong, high and muscular), of the violent and ungoverned movements made in scenes that were faster, typical movements of a machine, and also of your coldness and indifference in relation to humanity. Michael Biehn had a good performance too, because he convinces the spectator of his protective function in relation to Sarah Connor.It's an excellent movie because it mixes action, adventure, tension, fiction and suspense along with sound and visual effects (explosion, fight, fire), atmospheric effects of light and darkness, and a logical sequence from one scene to the next, during all the story. Besides, the movie ""The Terminator"" has a similar plot to other movies such as ""Aliens"", ""Titanic"", ""The Abyss"" among others.",The Terminator

Better photography and special effects existed at the time. Much classier direction could be found in abundance, I kid not.It was the film of the moment, and the moment was a very complex one. A moment when two thirds of the world were holding their breath for World War III to begin. The schools and mass media were educating children as young as twelve that nuclear war was probable, and what those terrified young people needed to do should ""the four minute warning"" (in the U.K.) be given by T.V., radio and War War II relic Klaxon Horns. Yes, my generation grew up with this. When humans with itchy trigger fingers were barely being controlled by others with nerves of steel and the courage to state that Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) was not a viable solution. However, while they could not reach ""the big red buttons"", the military of the two superpowers of ""The Cold War"" were using computers and technology to enhance their reasoning and their ability to respond.Films like ""The Forbin Project"" and ""War Games"" almost projected the unidentified third man into the public psyche, but these films were either too cult/boring or too Hollywood Happy Ending to hit the mark.The Terminator ended all doubts. If we did not kill each other, the machines we built to ""defend"" us were the unidentified enemy and, if given enough power and freedom, they would resolve to eliminate all humans in order to survive our MAD ambitions.This alone would have made this a worthy 8/10 movie, but the twist that was added by the fully comprehensible Time Travel Paradox slotted in to the life story of the main character, ""Sarah Connor"", is what maintains this film as number one for me.Spoiler Alert: If you have not seen it, read no further. Come back and read the rest of this review after seeing the movie (yes, really, through to the end {the movie, not this review!} ) to see if you agree.The first time I saw the movie, I was perhaps 17, but the Time Travel Paradox had been hit upon by a number of books and one film in particular, ""The Time Machine"". But the consequences of changing the past that could affect the present such that you might never be born in order to travel back in time to make those changes, thus time always self corrects, etc, etc was not made so startlingly clear until ... ""What should I tell you about your father?""The line just hung in the air.It marked, (and still marks), the viewer deeply with a question that seems impossible to answer.If Sarah Connor did not tell her son, ""John Connor"", that his already dead father had not yet been born, but that they will meet when John is a grown man and a leader of a group of guerrilla warriors fighting against artificially intelligent machines that will be set on the absolute extermination of the human race, and that he must convince and prepare that man, his father, ""Kyle Reese"", to travel back through time (through a time travel device that will be created by the genocidal machines specifically to send a robot soldier, ""The Terminator"", back to the recent past to kill John Connor's mother, Sarah, before John is born) to save his mother and ... to become his father.From here, the viewer is left with an endless list of questions that can keep the mind imagining consequences of action, or inaction, on the parts of any of these three protagonists, Sarah, Kyle and John ... plus the damned Terminator and the SkyNet computer network.Best movie of all time? Thirty years on, and the number of questions continues to increase. No other film, science fiction or otherwise, has created so many thoughts that related directly to my life (particularly during the Cold War), to my work (during thirty years in the I.T. industry) and to the future I see for the human race ... and as hard as we have fought to avoid it, the more we seem to be creating it.""There is a storm coming""",The Terminator

Honestly, I could have written the script for it. IMDb wants me to submit at least ten lines of text? This movie is not worth that kind of time. It's a B movie, pure and simple.

831,peegelandrus,I liked it.,8,24 July 2015,"I liked the 1st Terminator movie because of the plot of the movie. I also liked the idea of the Terminator going back in time was a very good idea in my mind. The gun-fighting scenes are good as well. I liked every single fight in the Movie. I especially liked the ""Cyborg sent back in time"" part and the ""saving the world"" part. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit because of that. The only bad thing was the end. But i enjoyed that too. There were some bad spots what i didn't like hence the 8/10. The movie overall was quite good. The aspect of the Movie was extrorinary. The plot was amazing, the way the movie was acted out was good, so i can't really say i didn't enjoy it a lot.",The Terminator
832,erkam-timur,Arnie is best,10,26 June 2019,"It was very good cult action movie made in pure 80's atmosphere. Acting is so good,cgi is so good,soundtrack is soo god, this movie is a action classic every body must see!",The Terminator
833,KinoRunner9732,1984 and Beyond ...,10,12 May 2016,"This quintessential marker of the decade may be modest in terms of its budget. But it's certainly epic in terms of its ideas. A piece of action-packed ""tech stuff"" on the surface, ""The Terminator"" comes a very long way from simply being a stylish noiresque chase movie with some time travel elements thrown in to spice it up. Because, first and foremost, this stuff is thoroughly rich in meaning. In essence, it's a superbly told tale of a lone warrior on a doomed mission who is given only a fleeting moment to share with the only one of his life. While desperately trying to protect her and everything human in human beings from forces so overwhelmingly destructive that they seem to be on par with the will of the gods in Greek tragedies. And the powerful background, permeated with a sense of impending fate, against which this drama is unfolding, apart from helping to deliver a serious and convincing message, somewhat unexpectedly turns it into one of the most poignant and poetic love stories – where love conquers time and space and the moment becomes eternal. So this picture should be named among very few actually substantial and emotional fables produced by the department of mainstream entertainment – as it sets off on an infinite journey far beyond the confines of a genre  and beyond the infinite.",The Terminator

835,JacKessler,Re-Watch(able),10,15 August 2018,"Nothing to add to the positive reviews. However, during my early attempts to write screenplays, this was a film I played on repeat (often in the background) as one to study. I believe it is worth the same exploration for any brewing screenwriter.",The Terminator

At that time, the movie was a very big thing and I remember that I was very excited to watch it. Overall the movie is great, for that specific time it was a perfect movie. Sci-Fi with a bit of horror I can say that the movie makes you feel the chill.",The Terminator

Brilliant Action/Scifi/Slasher/Love Story. Along with the original Blade Runner and Alien, The first Terminator film is one of the greteset Sci Fi movies ever made. Yes the mono sound track and low budget effects are part of it's charm.",The Terminator
