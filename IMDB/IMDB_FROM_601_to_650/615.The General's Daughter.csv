0,Leofwine_draca,An important subject given the Hollywood treatment,6,4 May 2017,"THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER is an earnest mystery thriller set in a US army base. The whodunit aspect of the storyline brought to mind some of the Columbo episodes that had similar military themes although this is much more adult fare with some very dark subject matter. The film looks at the top of sexism in the army, taken to the extreme in the vicious gang rape and murder of a young woman by her peers.It's certainly a hard-hitting topic and one we see in the headlines all too often, and thus THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER has a worthy feel to it. However, the main problem the film suffers from is the flashy '90s feel which gives it a dated vibe that you wouldn't find in a similar movie made in the '80s or even '90s. CON AIR director Simon West is a poor choice for director; they should have found someone who could make a more gritty and realistic movie. The shoehorned, Hollywood-style action feels ridiculous although Travolta is solid enough and the likes of James Woods and James Cromwell get to do their bit in the acting stakes.",The General's Daughter
1,SnoopyStyle,lurid overstuffed,4,20 October 2016,"Popular Lt. Gen. Joseph ""Fighting Joe"" Campbell (James Cromwell) announces his retirement and is expected to be the next VP pick. Warr. Off. Paul Brenner (John Travolta) flirts with his daughter Capt. Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson). U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command agent Brenner goes undercover to take down illegal arms trade on the base. When Elizabeth is found striped and killed, Brenner is assigned the case with his ex agent Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe). Col. William Kent (Timothy Hutton) leads the base MPs. They have 36 hours before the FBI sends in a task force. The investigation uncovers Elizabeth's hidden sex dungeon and her commander in psy ops Col. Robert Moore (James Woods) becomes the main suspect.This thriller is overloaded with hard-boiled performances and sleazy sexuality. There is so much manly posing that Travolta gets to be off-putting. He doesn't need to be the brash overconfident investigator. He is better as a normal human being so that this over-the-top story can actually effect him emotionally. Every performance, every twist, and every turn seem to be raised up to an eleven.",The General's Daughter
2,lee_eisenberg,generally speaking...,7,9 November 2006,"""The General's Daughter"" is sort of half-good, half-not. It has a good plot and all, but it probably would have been better had they cast someone a little less well known in the lead role (John Travolta's presence nearly turns the whole thing into a star-driven vehicle). And of course, there's lots of long speeches (often shouted) about the ramifications of the events portrayed. Other than that, it's a worthy look into cover-ups in the military - I suspect that what this movie portrays is moderate compared to reality.So, if you can ignore John Travolta's overbearing presence, it's a movie worth seeing. Also starring Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton, James Woods, Clarence Williams III and even a cameo by John Frankenheimer.I wonder whether or not they realized that they gave James Cromwell's character the same name as the famous mythologist.",The General's Daughter
3,jboothmillard,The General's Daughter,5,26 April 2009,"I had heard one or two people say that this is a really good film, so I tried it for myself, from director Simon West (Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider). Basically military detective Paul Brenner (John Travolta), with fellow detective Sara Sunhill (The Last of the Mohicans' Madeleine Stowe) is investigating the death of Capt. Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), who Paul coincidently met, but didn't realise wad the daughter of Lt. Gen. Joseph Campbell (James Cromwell). The corpse was found naked with signs of rape, torture and died from being strangled, and the detectives are asking questions to the key suspects who knew her, and her secret dominatrix lifestyle. It turns out there are quite a few cover-ups coming to light, and after the suicide of possible culprit Col. Robert Moore (James Woods), they can only help for more clues to the people truly responsible. In the end, the killers are found, but it also turns out that the General himself may have had some involvement with the horrific crime. Also starring Timothy Hutton as Col. William Kent, Daniel Von Bargen as Police Chief Yardley, Clarence Williams III as Col. George Fowler and film director John Frankenheimer as Gen. Sonnenberg. The film is filled with good performances, Woods in particular added a good bit of zing, as for the story, while it is a slightly weak script, the little twists and turns, and moments of blood and bangs do keep you a little interested. Worth watching!",The General's Daughter
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Lots Of Pluses and Minuses, But Entertaining",7,3 March 2006,"This was an excellent drama marred only by a little too much profanity and the normal Hollywood obsession of portraying the United States military as corrupt. (I have a news flash for filmmakers: there are some honest men in the military....really!!!) Feminism in the armed forces is another ""agenda"" item in this film.There are many pluses, however, with this movie that should be noted. . The acting is excellent with a deep cast featuring John Travolta, James Cromwell, Madeline Stowe, Timothy Hutton, James Woods, Clarence Williams III, Leslie Stefanson and more.I loved the dialog between Travola and Woods. It reminded me of the film noir films of the 1940s. The general's daughter, Stephanson, is a bit hard-edged in here but it's understandable when you find out why she acts the way she does. The characters the actors are all interesting and the story hooks you in right away. The cinematography is great. This looks stunning on DVD.There are no lulls in this film and the action isn't overdone, either. Very entertaining.",The General's Daughter
5,rmax304823,Disappointing Military Whodunnit.,3,24 March 2006,"All the ingredients seem to be there but the dish comes out flat.Nice cast, and they all do a journeyman job, but most of them are in minor roles and some of them contribute virtually nothing to the goings on. Madeleine Stowe for instance is radiant, as usual, with those crossed coal-black irises, but why is she here? I don't object to her presence. How could anyone? With that iliac garland and that modest bosom? I just question her presence. And there is a mean-looking redneck Southern sheriff whose only reason for being there seems to be providing a target for Travolta's unnecessary remark that he should be out clubbing the colored folks somewhere. The photography is first-rate too. Savannah has never looked quite so -- Southern.And that's about it.The story is so intricate that it's hard to follow. The script makes everyone except Travolta and Stowe into a suspect. People lurk in shadows. They peer intensely at a pair of general's stars (which have nothing to do with the movie) while ominous music slowly builds. Some speak elliptically, hinting at horrors, and it leads nowhere. Red herrings all over the place. The moment one is identified as some sort of villain, he's revealed as innocent and someone else comes under the magnifying glass, until he too is discarded, and we wind up with the one guy who has never been shown to be involved in any way in the crimes and who has been nothing but a cooperative friend to the two investigators. And even this revelation (involving a slow-motion explosion -- what else?) is anti-climactic because we have yet to get to the REAL villain! What the hell is the movie supposed to be about anyway? Is it an exercise in surrealism? It begins with Travolta asleep in his bed. An assassin creeps into his houseboat and shoots the place into little pieces before Travolta jumps him and they fall in the water and somebody starts an outboard motor in the middle of an underwater fight and the spinning screw fortuitously Cuisinearts somebody's face up and the water turns red and no satisfactory explanation for the fight to the death follows.Or -- let me put it this way. If you were a woman who was gang raped and beaten and your father visited you in the hospital, kissed your forehead, assured you of his love, and advised you to never think of the incident again, would you be willing to destroy your life in order to destroy his?Not to argue that the father -- in this case James Cromwell -- is morally right in taking his career into account. That's pretty selfish and his lack of righteous anger at his daughter's rapists is a big hole in his character.But his daughter, an Army captain of delicious aspect, tries to get her revenge by sleeping with every guy on the base in order to make him seem a fool. She succeeds and he finally tells her she must see a therapist or resign her commission.Now -- get this -- and this is seven years after the original brutal rape, which is implausibly presented to begin with -- she enlists the help of her friend and mentor (James Woods) who ties her spreadeagled and naked on the ground. And she arranges to have her father drive out to see her in this position, alone at night, and screams at him, something like, ""Do you see what they did to me? Do you feel guilty NOW?"" She tells him that she is going to remain in this position until everyone on the base knows about it and her father's career is torpedoed. Well -- the best advice she ever got came from him. (1) Try not to think about the original rape. And (2) get help.There is no help in the direction either. Lots of closeups of faces with tears or agonized expressions. (Except for Clarence Williams, who can produce tears but no expressions at all.) I suppose, in the end, we are supposed to find ourselves brimming over with the self-righteous anger that Cromwell's general lacks. A woman in the Army has been foully mistreated and we are enraged. The problem is a real one. There seem to be more sexual assaults on women in the military than is usually assumed, although it's doubtful that many of them are officers. As a social problem, it deserves a more thoughtful and skillful treatment than you can find in this movie.",The General's Daughter
6,Quinoa1984,Very mysterious,5,15 July 2000,"The General's Daughter may be flawed, but thanks to the acting, it's hardly a matter.  John Travolta gives a good performance and James Woods gives an even better one, showing that one scene with back and forth dialougue can make one film pretty interesting.  Still, a good mystery, with the plot set in good place for one of Travolta's best pics.  A-",The General's Daughter
7,michaelRokeefe,Uncover the cover up. Good mystery/drama.,4,4 February 2000,"A beautiful young woman (Leslie Stefanson) is found raped and murdered. Not only is she an Army Captain, she is the daughter of a very popular General, played by James Cromwell. The general wants a hurried and hush-hush investigation that won't interfere with his political future. John Travolta plays Warrant Officer Paul Brenner that uncovers the victim's past as a major clue to her demise. Madeleine Stowe is co-investigator and verbal sparring partner for Travolta's character. Timothy Hutton and James Woods are also featured. Graphic scenes.",The General's Daughter
8,Hey_Sweden,Slick and engrossing.,7,19 February 2015,"John Travolta stars as Paul Brenner, a charismatic man in the Army's C.I.D. unit. Paul is called upon to solve the strange rape & murder of the title character, Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson). Paul gets paired with a rape investigator named Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe), who just happens to be a former flame of his. As Paul and Sara work the clues, they discover a string of characters who all have their secrets to hide. And it becomes apparent that the Army's main concern is keeping things quiet and maintaining the public image.While far from a great story, this is still an absorbing one. There's a very tragic and somber arc that stems from the Elizabeth Campbell character being a *very* troubled individual. The story isn't always too believable, but director Simon West keeps the plot progressing in competent enough fashion, with a couple of twists along the way. The more serious and sordid elements are sometimes contrasted with not terribly amusing banter between Travolta and Stowe.The exemplary supporting cast is the main reason to watch. Travolta lays on the goofy charm a bit much at first (and does a deliberately bad Southern accent for too long a time), but as the movie goes on, the better his performance gets. He and Stowe are able to create some chemistry. Stefanson is effective as the victim, and James Cromwell as her general father is completely convincing. Clarence Williams III also scores strongly as the generals' comrade, who's loyal to the core. The real standout is the always dynamic James Woods, as Elizabeths' mentor; the scenes where he and Travolta are attempting to outwit each other are just about the best in the movie.Well shot (by Peter Menzies Jr.) and decently paced, ""The General's Daughter"" manages to be watchable for a little under two hours.Seven out of 10.",The General's Daughter
9,anaconda-40658,The General's Daughter Has Daddy Issues.,9,2 July 2015,"The General's Daughter (1999): Dir: Simon West / Cast: John Travolta, Madeline Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton, Leslie Stefanson: Drama about the dying of the soul of a person who has been damaged by the past. The General's daughter is found naked and tied by pegs to the ground. She is dead but flashbacks convey when she died in spirit. Opening scene is an unnecessary action blunder to arrest a weapons assailant then John Travolta is brought in to investigate the murder. Madeline Stowe is enlisted as a rape specialist with which whom Travolta was once involved with. Director Simon West gains more conviction here than he did with that action junk Con Air. Here he is backed by a superb production that isn't too over the top, as well as a great cast. Despite a bad opening Travolta is superb in his search that leads to a double life of the victim. Stowe's role begins with a hint of standard romantic formula before allowing her to be clever in her methods of obtaining information. James Cromwell plays the General who seeks answers. From there he is merely a plot contact until the third act where truths arise. Timothy Hutton does a fine job as a squadron with a nasty side. Leslie Stefanson plays the victim, the General's daughter whose reasons are made clear in the conclusion. Effective thriller regarding scars and their inability to heal if the damage runs too deep. Score: 9 / 10",The General's Daughter
10,Wuchakk,"Sordid, but worthwhile and potent (for some)",7,10 March 2014,"1999's ""The General's Daughter"" takes place at and around a coastal Georgia military base. John Travolta plays an Army investigator who teams up with Madeleine Stowe, a woman he once had an affair with (yeah right), to solve the ugly murder of the daughter of the commanding officer, herself a captain.Whether you like Travolta or not, there's no denying his star power. He easily carries this film as the protagonist from beginning to end. The real cast highlight for me, however, is the stunning Madeleine Stowe (remember her from 1992's excellent ""Last of the Mohicans""?). Throughout most of the film Madeleine wears a white sleeveless shirt and form-fitting tan-ish slacks; she's just spellbinding. The film is rated R and for good reason. There are numerous scenes of a naked woman staked out spread-eagled, both alive and dead. Besides murder, the picture features overt elements of S & M and gang rape. This may turn some potential viewers away, but the film is worth sticking with if you can brace yourself for the sordid aspects. How so? Because ""The General's Daughter"" powerfully shows that sexual abuse must be addressed and not shoved under the rug. Inner wounds must be properly bound and healed, not dismissed with a casual shrug.My wife and I recently saw a fascinating documentary on prostitutes. I never could understand how a woman could have sexual relations (especially oral sex) with some dirty, smelly sleazebag for money. It's gag-inducing to me. With one exception every prostitute interviewed confessed to being sexually abused while growing up. The abuse was never properly addressed and, consequently, no real inner-healing could take place. The abuse literally damned the women to a sordid life of self-loathing and self-destruction. My heart goes out to them! The sleazy sexual elements are so in-your-face in ""The General's Daughter"" that it's hard to look past it to the meat of the story. The unaddressed sexual abuse of the General's daughter leads to a promiscuous and deviant lifestyle, resulting -- of course -- in misery and (ultimately) destruction.Travolta's character briefly knew the general's daughter before her murder. What compels him to solve the murder and enact justice & vengeance on the direct and indirect perpetrators (aside from the fact that it's his job) is that he clearly saw a genuine gleam of beauty and life in her. Reviewer Steven Quan understandably objects that, if she was as horribly abused as depicted in the story, she wouldn't be so vibrant and perky. But, nevertheless, this vibrancy and inner beauty is authentic. Travolta knows it because he experienced it. It's a glimpse of who she really was or could be, a glimmer of her potential as a woman and a human being. True, most of it may merely be a public veneer, an act she hides behind, but the flimsy root is REAL. Unfortunately it's overshadowed by her raw torment within, inner pain so great that it compels her to ridiculously radical actions.When Travolta finally figures out what and who destroyed the inner beauty and potential of this young woman his righteous anger is potent and palpable.I heard the story was loosely based on real-life events, but can't verify it.The picture was filmed on location in coastal Georgia, around Savannah. There's also a breathtaking shot of West Point, NY, where a small portion of the story takes place.CONCLUSION: ""The General's Daughter"" is more than just a meaningless detective mystery/thriller. It's thought-provoking and delivers a powerful message. Some won't get it. Some are unable to get it. Others can't get past the sleazy elements. For the rest of us it's a worthwhile, heavy and potent piece of filmmaking. Travolta is at his charismatic best and Madeleine Stowe is spellbinding. I'd give it a higher rating, but the implausible Hollywoodisms stack-up toward the end and the revelation of the murderer and aftermath is weak.GRADE: B+",The General's Daughter
11,deloudelouvain,"Great cast, good entertaining story.",8,25 October 2020,"It wasn't the first time I watched The General's Daughter but I still enjoy it as the first time. It's just an entertaining movie with a good story and an excellent cast. With names like John Travolta, Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, James Woods, Timothy Hutton you can't really go wrong, all class actors. The whole cast raised the quality of this movie. John Travolta might be a fool in my eyes (and not only in mine) since he became a scientologist but it's fair to say he's a good convincing actor. He did a good job playing his character. As the story unfolds the mystery gets clear, it's just pleasant to watch if you're into that kind of stories. The directing looked all very professional, there's just nothing bad to write about this movie so I'm a bit surprised it doesn't get a higher rating. Definitely worth watching if you like crime/mystery movies.",The General's Daughter
12,SimonJack,Not a true story as the film implies,6,24 October 2016,"This film has enough mystery and intrigue to make it interesting. But, it's a dark story concerning a West Point rape cover-up and later murders. Some scenes are graphic with violence and sexual activity. Only mature adults should watch this film, and even then I don't recommend it. I only watched it because it was billed as being based on a true story, and I have military background in my family. Yet, I've since tried to find verification of this and it's nowhere to be found on the Internet. I discount the Wikipedia entry checked on this date (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General%27s_Daughter_(film), that says the film is ""based on true story"" (sic). In fact, ""The General's Daughter"" is based on a 1992 novel of the same name by Nelson DeMille. In a forward to his book, DeMille doesn't claim that it is based on a true story. Instead, he says, ""This story could happen anywhere, anytime — in fact, you may find some similarities in this story to a Greek tragedy. But what happens in 'The General's Daughter' couldn't happen quite like this, except on a modern American military base."" So, it's a clear piece of fiction, even though the end trailer implies otherwise. The trailer, just before the credits run, reads, ""General Joseph Campbell was court-martialed and found guilty for his involvement in the cover-up of his daughter's rape. He subsequently withdrew from public life."" Apparently that was part of the story in the book. But when the film doesn't run a disclaimer that the story and characters are fictitious, the film's ending can mislead many, or most viewers. Most of the cast in this film are all good. A few seem wooden. John Travolta is CID Warrant Officer Paul Brenner. Madeleine Stowe is his sidekick, Warrant Officer Sara Sunhill. James Cromwell plays Lt. Gen. Joseph Campbell. Leslie Stefanson is his daughter, Capt. Elizabeth Campbell. The performances of the rest of the cast are mixed. The military setting, at a fictional Army base in Georgia, doesn't seem quite real. Paramount built the sets and filmed the movie at four sites in Georgia and two in California. But none of these were Army installations. The point of clear fiction aside, the story is intriguing. But the screenplay doesn't do a very good job of telling the story. I didn't read the book, but from its reviews on line it probably was more coherent than the movie with the various incidents. The film is choppy in places, it leaves holes and fails to answer significant questions that arise. For instance, Brenner doubts that Col. Robert Moore (played by James Woods) committed suicide. He says it was made to look that way. But it ends there and we never find out who killed Moore. When Brenner learns the names of the men who raped Elizabeth at West Point, he offers the list to Gen. Campbell, who refuses to take it. But the film never says if those men were brought to justice. The book did cover those things, but the movie doesn't. The opening scene with credits rolling shows Brenner driving his car through an area while combat training is underway. That wouldn't happen in real life. A brief overhead shot that was supposed to be West Point above the Hudson River looked like a photograph or painting. Little things like that lessen the film's sense of realism and accuracy.With a tighter script and much better set work and shooting, this could have been a very good murder mystery and look at psychology in the Army. It's just so-so as it is; and Paramount clearly goofs by not running a disclaimer that the film is fiction. A featurette with the DVD gives some interesting details about the making of the film. It's called, ""Behind the Secrets.""",The General's Daughter

17,sddavis63,It Tries To Do Too Much And It Ends Up Doing Too Little,3,9 July 2012,"You can't really fault people for trying. It's the very extravagantly convoluted nature of this ""thriller"" that ends up being its downfall. There's just too much in it. There's too much of an attempt to set this up as a ""mystery thriller"" so that it actually ended up becoming rather dull waiting to see it through to its inevitable conclusion. The story revolves around a young female officer (Leslie Stefanson) who is murdered on base, left naked and tied spread-eagled to the ground, but not actually raped. How would this have happened and who would have done it and why? To make this even more mysterious, she happens to be the daughter of a soon to be retired general (James Cromwell) who also just happens to be a leading candidate for Vice President. So there's already a lot going on. Leading the investigation is Warrant Officer Brenner (John Travolta), assisted by Warrant Officer Sunhill (Madeline Stowe) - who just happen to also have had a precious romantic relationship. And, oh yes, just before she was murdered, Brenner just happened to have met the young victim. There are just far too many ""just happen-ings"" for this to be really believable. That's problem 1.Problem 2 is with the characters themselves. Put bluntly - who really cares. We weren't interested enough in the victim (having only been briefly introduced to her) and the general is both a general and a soon to be politician - neither identity really bringing forth a lot of sympathy from me. Brenner and Sunhill? Well, one hopes they solve the case (and one has an idea of who is ultimately going to be painted as the bad guy - if not the murderer - in this) but I found myself not really caring much about either of them. With no one really to feel any empathy for, this becomes a tough slog. The secondary characters in this are certainly not intended to bring forth any sympathy.There's a problem when you have really no one to feel any great connection with in this movie. Alongside that, for a supposed ""thriller"" there really aren't all that many thrills in this. Yes, a bit of mystery, and a bit of surprise when it's revealed what finally happened that night the young woman was murdered, but nothing I would call thrilling. I was disappointed.

18,Buddy-51,tepid murder mystery,5,23 July 1999,"Despite high powered talent both in front of and behind the camera, ""The General's Daughter"" emerges as a tepid, run-of-the-mill murder mystery set on a deep South army base. The murder victim is the (to put it politely) sexually loose daughter of the camp's highly distinguished general; Travolta portrays the investigator, torn between loyalty to the military and to his civilian duties, whose job it is to unravel the mystery of her bizarre death. Though based on true events, the film's screenplay fails to develop a particularly compelling or surprising story, settling instead for a gallery of essentially stereotypical characters. We have, for instance, the cynical, but essentially decent tough guy investigator; the hard-as-nails female helpmate, who, of course, has shared a failed romantic past with the hero; and the by-the-rules-at-all-costs military father, willing to sacrifice his daughter's life on the altar of doing what's best for the institution.In addition, the film lines up the usual array of red herrings, false leads, and strawmen suspects that Travolta's character must bat away before the final solution is revealed. That resolution comes in the form of a ludicrous, barely credible scene in which the guilty person, as always, pointlessly explains to the investigators every detail concerning the execution of the crime. Given nothing in the way of fully developed or fleshed out characters to portray, the actors are left to essentially sleepwalk through their roles. It is obvious none of their hearts are in these dull proceedings. Travolta needs perhaps to begin challenging himself a bit more in more demanding roles and stop settling for such routine assignments as the one he has found in ""The General's Daughter"".",The General's Daughter
19,sol1218,A Rainy night In Georgia,6,19 December 2003,"******SPOILERS****** One rainy night in Georgia a young women is found murdered at the Ft. McCullen Army Base. She turns out to be the bases commanders Lt. Gen Joseph Campbell, James Cromwell, daughter Capt. Elisabeth Campbell, Leslie Stefanson. Elisabeth worked in the Pys/Opps department on the army base which is into manipulating and playing with peoples minds. Assigned to the case are Warrant Officers Paul Brenner and Sara Sunhill, John Travolta and Madeleine Stowe, to find the murderer. There are a number of fingerprints found on the murder site that belong to Col. Robert Moore, James Woods, and he's arrested and put into lock-up. Later because the officer, Col. William Kent, Timothy Hutton, in charge of lock-up wasn't told the reasons for Moore's incarceration he's released to his quarters. Brenner and Sunhill go to Moore's house to re-arrest him and find him dead, he shot himself. The trail of Capt. Campbell's murder leads the investigators to West Point where they find out that Capt. Campbell was brutally raped in a military exercise some seven years ago. The rape, with the help of her father Lt. Gen.Campbell, was covered up for the good of the military as well as the academy. Elisabeth Campbell over the years developed a deep and bitter resentment against her father Lt.Gen.Campbell for not trying to find and punish those who beat and raped her. Working in Pys/Opps she used what she learned there, in mind games, to play with and torture her father's mind over his betrayal of her for his love of the army. One of those games that she was playing on her father seemed to have gone terribly wrong the night she was found murdered. Ridiculously contrived story about the going's on behind the scenes in the US military. John Travolta acts in the movie more like a vicious thug then an army investigator brutalizing and intimidating everyone that he comes in contact with in regards to the murder investigation, from generals to privates and this guy is only a warrant office! The best thing that you can say about Travolta's acting in the movie is that he dropped that very unconvincing and annoying southern accent that he used early in the film; who did he think he was playing? Gomer Pyle USMC?. The accent was so phony that it almost got him killed earlier in the movie when he tried to set up some militia type, by selling him arms. The on the ball militia man got wind of him just by listening to Trovolta talk as well as his stupid and obnoxious actions when he was dealing with him. The way the movie treated the US military was the biggest crime in it. There's nobody in the movie that you could consider normal including it's star John Travolta. With a surprise ending that was so contrived, in the light of the serious subject matter, that it came across almost as a comedy. With the only normal and stable person in the army as well as the movie turning out to be the murderer. The only good thing that one can say about ""The Generals Daughter"", in light of how it insulted and demeaned the US military, is that it was based on a not true story.",The General's Daughter
20,callanvass,"The General's Daughter is a slick,engrossing murder mystery,That'll keep you guessing.",8,28 December 2009,"The General's Daughter pulls out all the stops to give you an unpredictable ride,you won't soon forget!. It starts off at a horribly slow pace,from then on,I honestly thought I was in for a long night,but it quickly picked up,and put me in it's grip,while never letting go. It throws some great little swerves your way,to keep you guessing who the major culprit is. And while I had a decent feeling what the main conspiracy was gonna be,and I ended up being right,it still gave it a very nice try. I really liked the atmosphere it had to it. Seeing Brenner walk around the base often managed,to give me the chills. Some have complained about John Travolta's miscasting as Brenner. However I have to disagree,he had the perfect balance,of cockiness and charisma to Brenner. Here, he played an arrogant,but likable hero. Rape is quite the controversial subject,so I found the featured subject to be,quite uncomfortable. The ending itself is a knockout. The confrontation between Brenner and Lt.Gen Joseph Campbell is one to remember,and very suspenseful. The General's Daughter is quite a delight of a film. I was quite surprised,by how engaging it truly was,the 6.1 rating is horribly low,for the quality of this film.Performances. John Travolta is a rock as Brenner. He oozes charisma,while bringing that patented charm,we know all too well about. He's full of himself,but we appreciate his tenacity,his never back down attitude,and most importantly,his chemistry with Madeline Stowe,is above average. James Woods is a revelation as Moore. This guy can eat a potato and make it look interesting,whenever he was on screen,my eyes were glued. Madeleine Stowe is beautiful,but manages to give a competent performance as well,fluffy,yet believable. James Cromwell is a class act. While I never agreed with his character's direction,or actions,I thought he did a fabulous job. Timothy Hutton is an actor i'm not too familiar with,since I haven't seen him in much. However here he is excellent in his screen time,having a very key part near the end. Leslie Stefanson is very pretty and did well,with what she had to do.Bottom Line. The General's Daughter is a superbly crafted,murder mystery. It will often leave you on the edge of your seat,while entertaining you in the process. It was a great way to spend two hours,therefore,I highly recommend it.8/10",The General's Daughter
21,johnnyboyz,"Not without energy nor a fair share of diligence, but this is fairly middling stuff.",6,7 August 2013,"John Travolta might very well be the best thing about The General's Daughter: a rather mediocre, although not without its moments, detective thriller which uses military iconography and the idea of corruption at the core of something quite prestigious to tell a tale that doesn't feel like something you haven't already seen. He exudes a brash confidence here, a swagger that has him come across as someone flying through a mystery without a care in the world and yet with every care in the case he's trying to solve. If the film doesn't necessarily depict him swathing from place to place, beating people up and throwing them against walls in trying to find answers, then what does it depict? The pleasing thing is that it happens to work, his role a man seemingly stuck somewhere in-between cocksure, psychotic and just plain old righteous.Travolta plays a United States Army veteran named Paul Brenner, a man who appears to have a deep-south based twang; lives on a river boat and feels the need to place a hair over his front door before he leaves each time so as to know if anybody's entered in the meantime. During these early stages, we still only know him as Sgt. White – a man who potters into a local army base in a beaten up car where the motorcade of expensive looking sedans transporting someone important remind reiterate his rank. This is, tactfully, all later to be revealed as bogus and the sense of the film playing tricks on us is apparent – let the games begin. When the main body of the film does get going, we wave goodbye to these opening exchanges via a somewhat impressive second unit sequence involving the dark of night; crowded jetties and some underwater material, as one of Brenner's cases ends and another is on the cusp of beginning with the fact that he's pretty handy in combat in mind. The film's director, Simon West, who would go on to carve out a niche for himself in directing action with 1997's ""Con Air"" already under his belt, does well on familiar ground.Things turn sour in the wider scheme of things when the titular daughter of James Cromwell's General Campbell is found spread eagle on a training ground: stripped; murdered and tied to some stakes. Things seemed rosy the previous nights, when her father hosts a magnificent gala on the base with all in attendance; his titular daughter's smile adorning her face and not alluding to anything brash or out of place. But there was something sneaky about the way in which the dinner was presented to us; something about the music, something about the Gothic hall wherein they met – as if it were some kind of cult gathering. It is this death Brenner must investigate along with Madeleine Stowe's ranked rape councillor Sara Sunhill. It is a shame that Stowe, of whom I've always seen on-screen as quite a delicate presence through the roles she's played in the likes of Twelve Monkeys and Closet Land, is asked to spit the sort of rough-and-tumble dialogue Travolta can with ease. With Stowe, it doesn't quite work as well and this is epitomised in a rough scene when she must infiltrate a shower room full of butch male soldiers before barrack a man for answers.Part of me wants to describe The General's Daughter as ""old fashioned"". In the days of ""Serpico"" and ""All the President's Men"", this sort of one-man crusade for justice and truth were somewhat of the mainstay for mainstream American cinema and were often narrative-driven and quite good. West's film has the star-cast and enjoyed somewhat of a summer release throughout the Western world, but it is far from what constitutes a ""blockbuster"" – it's a film telling a story; unfolding a murder case involving characters it takes time to establish and must work out as to how they feel about one another. It has its bright spots, but resorts to dialogue and exposition where the depiction of a central context should be the order of the day. Take the scene in James Wood's character's office, where he speaks to Travolta about one's demeanour and the flaws in body language when telling a lie, etc. Such a sequence exudes a brash confidence for the moment, but a better thriller might've placed Woods in direct opposition to Brenner and allowed them to play off one another utilising these traits.In the end, one cannot, unfortunately, describe it in certain terms as much more than a B-movie; a piece whose construction and ethic are good but whose crux sees it depict a lot of shouting; fighting and ego-measuring where something like ""Michael Clayton"" was refined; smooth and elegant in its tone and attitude to its story-telling. It's not that West has made anything terrible, in fact it is the best of his works that I've seen when lined up against the aforementioned Con Air and the first Tomb Raider movie. Those expecting something synonymous with his name will be disappointed, those looking for recognisable names and faces in role you know they can play in their sleep on top of what is a rather engaging narrative of depravity and inner-filth will not be.",The General's Daughter

23,helpless_dancer,"I renamed this one ""The General Agenda""",7,4 September 2001,"Here we have another Hollywood attempt to brainwash the sheeple....and I would imagine once again they will be successful. I'll start off by saying I enjoyed the film, even though it was pretty corny. Travolta is always fun in this style of picture. My objection was the less than subtle way the viewer was bombarded with politically correct poppycock in the form of entertainment. One example was Paul Brenner's bringing a gift to a female officer. The haughty ""lady"" brushed the man's generosity off as ""sexist"". What happened to boy meets girl? Another illustration is the tenderness Brenner exhibited when dealing with the 2 homosexuals. What rot: God considers these people to be an abomination. Then there was the instance of Sara Sunhill parading arrogantly into an all male dressing room with the announcement ""woman aboard"" or some such statement. It was a tad late for some of the boys to cover up. Can't imagine that playing in reverse without screams of horror from the ladies - and rightly so. Later in this same scene when a group of men are addressed by Ms. Sunhill, they are presented as grinning, horny idiots with the manners of goats. In my opinion this movie was rife with reverse sexism and p.c. twaddle....as are many others, unfortunately. I read plenty of comments decrying the deplorable conditions of the downtrodden females in fatigues: many knuckles are ground into eye sockets as the tears flow: multitudinous hankies are dampened over the fateof these poor souls, as well as that of the 2 decent, loving, sexual perverts. The sorry part in all this is that the producers bothered little in disguising their intolerance.",The General's Daughter
24,elshikh4,Dream More Than Nightmare !,6,12 November 2008,"Now this is a movie with a case, which was made through another detective story. Some problems had weakened the bright points in both.Basically, I hated all the idiocy of the penultimate sequence, where there must be an explosion. The sudden discovering that (Timothy Hutton) is the killer, the sudden presence of him with (Madeleine Stowe) in a mine field, and the sudden confession by him (it even rains suddenly!). All of that was a typical hasty die-hard American movie's BIG finish. I didn't buy it. Then I didn't buy how both the lead characters survived a bomb without one slight scratch in them??(John Travolta)'s portrayal of (Paul Brenner) was utterly weak. OK, he is a star with massive charisma on screen, and he can convince simply, that's a gift, but the thing is that he goes no where higher with it. In a lot of scenes, (Travolta) was acting, just tunes his features on the right feeling without much deepness or creative personal touches. Something you can observe easily at his confrontation with the general in the last's office in which he knew the real story wholly.(Madeleine Stowe) is a good actress, but come to think of it, the script gave her nearly nothing to do. Review all of her role, she's not even the droll sidekick, she's (Brenner) himself after dividing him into 2. Actually, all of her scenes and lines could be whether handled by (Brenner), or deleted from the movie. I think she was essentially there as it should be a feminine sight, and also to represent the shinny sane face for the women in the movie's totally disturbing world. But even if, her role was empty, and her relationship with (Travolta) went nowhere. I just didn't get the last moments where (Travolta) and (Stowe) in separate cars smile at nothing. It looked like detached parts of unseen scene, plus it gave us no understandable end for their relationship... Surely something was missing.I didn't buy also the heroic behavior of the lead at the end. It's too cinematic to be logical into this story. I mean the brave (Brenner) will face all the society with the hideous truth. Fine. But with influential powerful man, like a General with boulder instead of a heart, who nearly killed his daughter for his career--it would be so easy for him to shut up (Brenner) once and for all. But who said anything about (Brenner)? We're talking about (John Travolta) here, who was looking dressy, jaunty wearing that military suit at the end, and must vanquish the evil guy with some one-liner where he insults that criminal general, hence all the audience in the theater goes: ""Hurrah, way to go Travolta!!""; welcome to the law of Hollywood happy ending! Though don't understand me wrong, I'm not against the happy endings, but in a brutal explicit satirical story like this, the other way around must be stronger, so the audience gets out of it so mad at any general like the one they saw.So, the rule of ""There must be one explosion, Hollywood star as a lead, a heroine, and happy ending"" wasn't so perfect here. And, the type that the movie chooses to put the whole painful picture through it was hot, attractive, commercial, but more damaging than expressing.Still, there are some enjoyable points, like the astonishing cinematography, largely in sick yellow and always sweaty; it gives the feeling that all the characters were imprisoned in some hellhole. (Simon West) is not another Hollywood executive; he's a director with professional flawless technique and one good vision too, you can tell that he was so much in love with the story. So with sharp editing, that sorrowfully got little frantic near the end, he pushed us all into this demented war zone with good elegiac sense, which couldn't be whole without the clever music score by (Carter Burwell). Just listen to its smart climax at the memorable finale; that was the truest, most perfect, moment of this movie.(Simon West) was one director who made me write his name after his first movie (Con Air - 1997) to follow his work carefully later, which was something I did with certain directors only. But, unfortunately, we didn't have much of this stylish artiest yet!I liked also some of the dialogue, despite how it could've been better. Some ironic implied points like making the character of Col. (Robert Moore), the only one to help the victim, as gay. Because by that he would be the only one who got nothing to do sexually to her in this deranged military base! Plus the many statues for soldiers at the mine field, like this base is full of silent stony inhuman soldiers. And being this bold as a movie is something that will always discompose. Though, mostly, (The General's Daughter - 1999) will remain as a Hollywood flick more than a satirical film.",The General's Daughter
25,dfranzen70,Not bad murder mystery set on Army base...,6,23 December 1999,"John Travolta stars as a warrant officer charged with finding the murderer of a popular general's daughter. Will he solve the crime? Of course he will - as with many murder mysteries nowadays, the killer is caught in a tidy, wrap-it-up fashion. The fun in these kinds of movies is in how the crook did the crime or in how the protagonist solves the crime. Joining Travolta in his quest is Madeline Stowe, who works with the rape victims-support squad. (Stowe's a good choice for the role, but her character is very superficially drawn.) We run into colonels, captains, privates, and more as Travolta and Stowe search for clues and... well, basically do detective stuff. Now, I'm certainly not going to give away the killer, but let's just say the writers didn't take much time in picking his identity, and you as viewer likely won't, either. Travolta undertakes his task with a sort of grim determination, with the kind of jaw-clenching superheroism you'd expect from maybe.... Superman, or something. There's not a whole lot he can do with the role, but you sort of get the sense that Travolta's a little miscast.
Basic plot? While Travolta tries to find out the killer's identity, the Army just wants to keep a lid on the whole episode, and they want it solved before the FBI comes in (conveniently, 36 hours after the crime). Ever see ""A Soldier's Story,"" which came out years ago and had a very similar plot? In that movie, there were plenty of twists and turns. In place of twists and turns in this movie, we have predictability and the aura of should-have-seen-it-coming. This is not a bad movie. In fact, it has earnest performances by Travolta, Stowe, James Woods, and James Cromwell (and a surprisingly effective one by Clarence Williams III!). The problem is that it's a little underplotted and a little too easy to follow. Instead of taking the viewer on a path to the truth that is swamped in a traffic jam of turns, this script takes a direct route. It makes for relatively uninteresting cinema.",The General's Daughter

27,slokes,Conduct Unbecoming,2,11 May 2005,"John Travolta trades his boogie shoes for Army boots as he delves into a deep-dish mystery of sex, duty, and passion, and while he and the rest of a strong cast serve up some entertaining performances, the movie at the center of things feels simultaneously overdone and half-baked.""The General's Daughter"" was an odd first choice for adapting the pulse-pounding fiction of Nelson DeMille to screen. It's a flawed mystery story about a woman found dead on an Army post in Georgia and the ugly underbelly exposed by the investigation of her killing. But there's a naked lady at the center of things, not to mention lots of cool ordinance to go boom in the night, so maybe it's a more obvious call than ""Plum Island,"" better as that book reads.There's more to the case than a woman officer's brutalization and killing, as becomes quickly apparent when investigator Paul Brenner (Travolta) and his former lover and current verbal sparring partner, Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe) visit the victim's residence and find a secret room filled with kinky sex toys and videotapes. The latter vanish moments after their discovery when an intruder jumps Brenner as Sunhill is conveniently out of the building, one early glaring difference from the book. It's alright to play with the storyline, especially when the source material isn't top-notch, but this was an early sign that the changes being made weren't necessarily improvements.Another is the depiction of the central crime. DeMille doesn't shy away from presenting us with a sexually frank and explicit story, but the filmmakers do, more or less. A lot of reviewers complain here that the victim is seen raped, but she really isn't, as the brutality and naked gruesomeness of the relevant scenes are covered up with odd light flashes and weird camera angles obviously designed to protect the actress involved from being too exposed, though giving us a Zalman King-style peak here and there. Instead of either a matter-of-fact portrayal ""Clockwork Orange"" style where the nastiness is right there, or else leaving the business entirely off-camera, director Simon West settles for a titillating compromise that robs the scenes in question of any real power.Whatever its flaws, the book did present a realistic-seeming investigation by Brenner and Sunhill, where Army protocols were observed and slender leads painstakingly followed. Gunplay was kept at a realistic minimum. In the movie, people are unrealistically attacked while investigating crime scenes and every encounter between Brenner and the post's senior officers is an excuse for overemoting. In the book several characters face criminal charges; in the film they seem more deserving of Section 8s.James Woods gives the most solid performance as one suspect, a psychologist who understands the victim better than anyone and also knows a bit about how a detective would ask him potentially leading questions. The way this character tries to simultaneously befriend and outsmart Brenner is a great scene. But then Woods leaves the film, rather suddenly and nonsensically, and we are left with more overt scenery chewing by James Cromwell and Clarence Williams III.Ultimately, this is a film designed for effect, from the first moments of Brenner's takedown of an assailant visiting his houseboat (shades of Sonny Crockett) to the last image of his driving blissfully through an Army practice area in the middle of a live-fire exercise. It hopefully won't be the last time Hollywood adapts a DeMille novel; next time hopefully they will choose a better one and do a better job.",The General's Daughter

It's not a very brainy movie, but it isn't necessarily dumb either, and it is certainly not afraid to get its hands dirty (which is important, nobody likes a sissy drama). The cast is comprised mostly of 'types' rather than characters, but even at that, the performance quality is not bad. John Travolta gets into character well enough to suspend disbelief that it is Travolta. Madaline Stowe as the detective by his side, backs him up nicely. James Cromwell, is also on board, although he is playing his usual type-cast high authority figure in a nice office. It is no new ground for him, but I always enjoy his screen presence. The General's Daughter provides a reasonably decent hundred minutes of entertaining thriller followed by an extra twenty minutes of creaky conclusion, but the finished project is satisfactory.",The General's Daughter
30,triple8,Not really all that good though it had a great cast.,5,25 March 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH: The General's Daughter certainly keeps one watching but it's a hard movie to like. That's not just because of the premise which is a pretty brutal one no doubt, but it's mainly because of the presentation of the events on screen. The constant flashbacks to the rape and murder are brutal to the point where it almost makes the film unwatchable. In certain films there are brutal scenes that are necessary to the story. But I really don't think we needed some of the scenes shown here. It took a great deal away from the film.Then there is the character of Lizzie's father and the fact that he basically destroys his daughter. This is a very cold movie. There were certain things I liked. I thought the cast was very good. Madeline Stowe is an amazing (and underrated) actress and it was good to see her in the film and then there's the casting of Travolta. I am not a major fan of his at all but for some unfathomable reason I really took to him in this role. He was very convincing and I love the way he told off Lizzie's father at the end. It may have Been a little contrived but it fit.And this really isn't a film you can turn off after you start watching because it does suck you in. But it is a tremendously unpleasant film to watch and though there are some really good scenes (I loved the scene of Stowe getting the captain to confess all about the rape), many scenes just seemed contrived and fell flat. What happens to this girl is so absolutely awful, one wants to see more scenes of the bad guys being found out and punished for their crimes. The movie ends on rather an abrupt note(though as mentioned already I did love that scene where Travolta tells the dad off.) To bad there weren't more scenes like that.The whole minefield scene-unnecessary.Straight out of a movie of the Week. So many cold dislikeable characters in this film. Scenes of such brutality that anyone turning the film off at those points would be perfectly understandable. The scene where Lizzie is tied up and yells at her father, subsequently dissolving into tears and yelling at him to come back, was awful. The whole movie, all of it, revolved around the torture, both emotional and physical of this girl. And though the casting was great, and the movie keeps you watching, I felt a better movie could have been made. My vote is 5 of 10 at the most.",The General's Daughter

I just have some complains due to the fact that until 40~50 minutes the film is a little boring, having too many names and faces.

Huh? And then the general himself, loving father of the girl, tells her to buck up and pretend it didn't happen? What? I mean there are some sociopathic guys at the Point, no doubt, but ten sickies in the same class stupid and sadistic enough to do something like that because they are jealous of her? The Army might well try to cover it up, but they sure as hell would want to know who did it. And it gets worse. The lifestyle that the daughter adopts because of this horror and the insane way she seeks to rid herself of the memory is like something dreamed up by a serial killer screen writer on a bad day. And then, after treating us to this nightmare of degrading misogyny, the authors, looking for a saving grace, run some closing words down the screen telling us that now there are over 200,000 women serving proudly in the military, as though perhaps we ought to be thankful for the events depicted in this film for that fact, or maybe they hoped to create the illusion that something like those events actually happened!I'm taking names: the director is Simon West, novel by Nelson DeMille, screenplay by Christopher Bertolini and William Goldman, who, alas, has seen better days. Here's an example of how trite some of the dialogue is. Travola's character is a seasoned veteran who actually fought in Vietnam and now is a warrant officer. He is told by Col. Fowler, another even more seasoned veteran, in dead seriousness that there are three ways to do things, ""the right way, the wrong way, and the army way."" Wow, that was original probably a hundred years ago, the sort of wisdom usually handed out by drill instructors to Private E-1's during basic training, not something a colonel might say to a warrant officer. Or, here's another. Travolta, recalling how as a raw recruit in Vietnam, he was by chance comforted by the general who asked where he was from, and when he heard from Boston, told him that the Red Sox had won the day before. The sound track soars and the camera pans to the faces of Col. Fowler and Madeleine Stowe to show us they know how uplifting and inspirational that was for the frightened young man.But don't blame the actors for this travesty. John Travolta, who begins the movie as an undercover sergeant, put a lot of (somewhat stupid) energy into his part, including a funny southern accent, and obviously had a good time. And you can see that James Woods tried hard to infuse some sparkle into the insipid lines and to bring some depth into the shallow and cliché-ridden character he plays. James Cromwell as the general was as ugly as sin and twice as despicable, while Madeleine Stowe looked good enough to ravish. And I thought Leslie Stefanson did a commendable job as the incomprehensible daughter.Bottom line: a new place in hell has been set aside for the purveyors of this sort of sado/sexploitation thriller We'll call it the Griffin Mill Screening Room (after the Machiavellian producer from The Player (1992)), a place in which the producers, the director and the writers are forced to view their concoction until the evaporation of the last black hole in space or the Big Crunch, whichever comes first.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

35,seymourblack-1,"Secrets, Suspects & Scandal",8,10 September 2013,"""The General's Daughter"" is a big budget thriller about an investigation into a shocking murder that took place at a U.S. Army base in Georgia. The circumstances of the killing are bizarre and the search for the truth unearths a number of unexpected findings that could potentially derail careers, cause great embarrassment to certain individuals and seriously damage the reputation of the Army. The stakes are high and the pressure on the investigator is enormous but his determination to see the job through provides the basis for this thoroughly absorbing tale of corruption, cover-ups and one of the worst forms of betrayal imaginable.After the dead body of Captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson) is discovered at an Army training compound, top military investigator Paul Brenner (John Travolta) is assigned to the case. He and fellow Criminal Investigation Division officer Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe) visit the site where the body was found and soon establish that the victim, who was found naked and staked to the ground, had been strangled, tortured and possibly raped. It emerges that Captain Campbell was the daughter of the base commander, General Joseph Campbell (James Cromwell).Brenner and Sunhill search the victim's home and in a concealed basement, find a collection of S & M paraphernalia and a number of video tapes which contain recordings of some of the activities that had taken place there. Shortly after, Colonel Robert Moore (James Woods) who was Elisabeth's commanding officer and mentor is questioned and arrested after his fingerprints are found on her dog tags. After a short spell in jail, Moore is released and put under house arrest but is found dead a little while later after apparently committing suicide.Despite coming under strong pressure to close the case after Moore's death, Brenner perseveres and goes on to discover that an incident which took place during her time at West Point and Elisabeth's difficult relationship with her father, both had a great significance to the way in which she died.In this story, Paul Brenner is a strong and resilient character who stays on course with his job despite being given a very tight deadline (36 hours) and being heavily pressured by both General Campbell and his adjutant, Colonel Fowler (Clarence Williams 111) on different occasions. He also has to contend with the uncomfortable tension that's created when he's teamed up with rape investigator Sarah Sunhill who also happens to be one of his ex-lovers. John Travolta, in a very strong performance, portrays Brenner's intensity, humour and single-mindedness with equal skill and is thoroughly convincing throughout.In a movie full of fine performances, James Woods and James Cromwell also stand out and their confrontations on separate occasions with John Travolta's character, provide a couple of the story's real high-points.""The General's Daughter"" is full of sharp dialogue and enough secrets, suspects and scandal to surpass the expectations of most murder mystery fans The fact that a high percentage of the action takes place in dark, shadowy surroundings contributes strongly to the marvellous atmosphere of the piece and considering all its elements, it's perfectly understandable why this movie was such a great box office success.",The General's Daughter
36,baumer,had promise but lacked something,7,18 June 1999,"The General's Daughter was an intriguing story but it had so many plot fillers and gaps that you leave the theater feeling, well, cheated.I went into this movie full of hope.  This movie had the feel and perhaps look of a really good whodunit.  I was hoping I would see a film that did to me what A Few Good Men did.  But it failed.  I won't really get into the story, because that is not really what we want to read here.  But what I will say is what I thought was good and what wasn't so good, and unfortunately the bad much outweighs the good.  First the good.I liked the lighting in the film.  It was lit beautifully to make you feel like you were walking onto the set of a horror film, and with the subject matter, it may as well have been a horror film.  Rape is a brutal crime and this rape was a step beyond almost any rape I have known about in any film with maybe the exception of DePalma's Casualties Of War.  But back to the lighting.  The use of shadows in this film were great.  And if you want to get all deep about it, the shadows were a metaphor for the truth behind this crime.  You may think you know and understand what happened to this poor girl, but there is always something else lurking in the shadows.The other element of this film that I enjoyed was James Woods and how his scenes were written with John Travolta.  I think this is some of his best work since "" The Specialist "" with Stallone.  But his psychological bantering with Travolta was pure joy.  If it wasn't for my memories of their encounters together, I may have enjoyed the film even less than I did.The other good thing about the film is some of the humour.  There is one particular line in the film where Travolta describes what precautionary measures one must do in this day and age before engaging in sexual intercourse that had me laughing for at least five minutes after the joke was over.  That joke alone is worth the price of a matinee ( here in London Ont. that is $5.25 ).But the rest of the movie is hollow.  There are many areas that don't seem to go anywhere and the film is ultimately unsatisfying at it's conclusion. First of all I don't but the killers identity and his reasons for committing the crime.  There is a much more logical killer and he is only implicated partially in the film.  Secondly there is no heroic ending.  By the end of this film, you want someone to pay dearly for what has happened to the girl who was killed.  And instead of getting visuals of the perpetrator being arrested and some cool line by Travolta to add grit to it, instead we are left with only a small written explanation as to what happens to this individual.  And that was frustrating.  Also unnecessary and quite trite was the affair that happened years ago between Travolta and Stowe.  This plot device was put in the film simply to give them something to talk about when they weren't investigating the case.  That is a sign of a weak screenplay.This movie had potential to be a good thriller, but it was maybe two steps behind and the story could have maybe gone through one more draft to tighten things up.  All in all I was rather disappointed.",The General's Daughter

I really enjoyed this film as it was different to the usual thriller.It wasn't scared to be near the knuckle and the acting was superb which cannot always be said for John Travolta. The other actors that impressed are James Wood ( shame about the fake tan though) and Madeleine Stone. Well worth a look at. 7 out of 10.,The General's Daughter
39,Bob-45,Botched Investigation,6,15 May 2000,"CAUTION:  SPOILERS AHEAD John Travolta's plays an over-the-top obnoxious jerk Army undercover detective who investigates the grotesque murder of a beautiful, promising young captain, whom happens to be THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER. Early in the film, Travolta gets to prove what a good undercover cop he is by nearly botching an investigation by manhandling a revolutionary buying guns from him.  Travolta alienates the revolutionary, he  comes back BEFORE the weapons exchange and tries to kill Travolta (not very smart OR plausible). Later, when his truck is disabled, Travolta is assisted by THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER (Leslie Stefanson), a bright, talented, self-assured and beautiful army captain.  Travolta, a career Warrant Officer, fails to show even the minimum military courtesies.  After Stefanson is brutally murdered, after an apparent gang rape, Travolta is teamed with a former girlfriend (Madelaine Stowe, looking even more drab than usual).  Absolutely no sparks fly (i.e., chemistry) between the two ""romantic leads.""  One wonders what might have been had the two females been reversed. This being a film being made by Hollywood Liberals, during the course of the investigation, Travolta gets to knock around an Army Major, insult and threated several colonels, and sanctimoniously dress down a Four Star General for complicency in the cover up the injustices against his daughter.  These same Hollywood Liberals being among those whom continue to support America's number one sex offender, a man accused of indecent exposure (Paula Jones), molestation (Kathleen Willey), sodomy (Monica Lewinsky) and worse (Juanita Brodderick), while, like the general, the rest of us stand mute witness as this man continues to be the ours and the general's commander-in-chief.",The General's Daughter
40,wkozak221,Uneven.,5,28 February 2021,"Spoiler alert. This movie is good overall. The cast and script are good. It keeps you guessing. Some of the characters are not that likable. Also, I get really annoyed with Travolta's accent. Another thing if he is from Boston why doesn't he have a slight accent?The big problem I have is the scene with the daughter and dad. IMO the scene where she is staked nude is totally unnecessary. Should have been cut.",The General's Daughter
41,TOMASBBloodhound,"Sleazy, provocative who-dunnit.",6,15 September 2012,"Good acting and a great cast elevate The General's Daughter above the sensationalist script and provocative premise. Its a pretty safe bet that whoever wrote this thing has some issues with the U.S. Army. John Travolta stars as Warrant Officer Paul Brenner whose job it is to internally investigate crimes happening within the U.S. Military. He and a rape investigator played by Madeline Stowe are trying to solve the murder and possible rape of a high-profile general's daughter. She is also an army officer, and apparently sexually involved with several officers in her father's command. Travolta and Stowe are given 36 hours to solve the murder of this attractive young woman found nude, strangled, and tied down with tent stakes in the middle of the army base. Virtually every male character we meet is dangled in front of us as a suspect. But which of them did it? And why? And what was the horrible secret the young woman carried with her all the way from her days as a West Point cadet??? Though very little of this film is plausible, the story and the fine actors will pull you in. Travolta was still in a pretty good groove when this was made. I don't think Battlefield Earth had yet been released. James Cromwell, with his role as the stuffy general concerned mostly with his reputation, pretty much solidified a place amongst the WASPy a-hole hall of fame. With this film, he joined the ranks of William Atherton, Dabney Coleman, Bob Gunton and a-holes of the past like Lane Smith, Paul Gleason, and J.T. Walsh. These actors could always be counted on to be strict wardens, cops, teachers, politicians and anything else synonymous with stuffy white males. Cromwell is a hoot. James Woods steals all of his scenes, as you might expect. Clarence Williams III is as intimidating as usual. That guy could be intimidating just going into McDonald's and ordering something off the dollar menu! Stowe's character seems tacked on; basically a living woman to put in danger. But she is always a welcome sight.It's no surprise that the army refused to have anything to do with this movie. Everyone on this base is portrayed as either a deviant sex-maniac, or a phony officer hiding behind a chest of ribbons and medals. The film wishes to be an advocate for women in the military who may in fact face sexual harassment on a regular basis. But the sleazy script and characters drown out any serious thought here. This movie is meant to press buttons rather than create awareness. There is a brutal rape scene at one point that would make Michael Winner smile. Anyone else will find it hard to sit through. The army base in this film is like the one in From Here to Eternity on crack. Not to give anything away, but it isn't really hard to figure out who committed the murder. Who is the least sleazy guy we've been introduced to around this base? Betcha he did it. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The General's Daughter
42,grahamsj3,Pretty decent,6,30 January 2004,"This film benefits from a pretty good story line. The acting is pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. It's a somewhat believable yarn centering on an apparently violent crime. However, the investigator, ably depicted by John Travolta, uncovers a lot more than he expected to find. I think this is an entertaining enough film that I'll probably rent it again, but it's not one that I'd buy. Overall, not too bad, but not great either.",The General's Daughter

This film features full nudity, it features BDSM sex, along with continuous foul language and plenty of blasphemy - all on an army base, the great american dream - absolute total corruption from the bottom to the top. Please STAY AWAY from this its not worth your time nor your effort given its subject matter. Its supposed to be an investigation into a murder of an officer, but given that every suspect is important, clearly the villain has to be high ranking.

44,raymond-15,Entertainig but most unlikely story,6,13 August 2001,"It's an interesting whodunit in a rather unusual setting - an army training college. When the general's daughter ( a captain) is found naked, her wrists pegged to the ground, raped and strangled, every soldier in the compound becomes a suspect of this vile deed. Warrant-Officer Paul Brennan (John Travolta) is given the job of finding the perpetrator and during the investigation he meets resentment and opposition on all sides.  There are some tense moments as the double life of the general's daughter is revealed. I'm not a behavioural scientist, far from it, but I do think that the general's daughter reacted in a very extreme way following a previous rape by soldiers during army manoeuvres.  Her father makes light of the matter for fear of bringing the army and his own important position into disrepute. The daughter's psychological reaction is such that she will not let the matter rest.  If you are able to accept the daughter's behaviour within the army and her extreme reaction to the pack-rape. you will probably enjoy the investigation as it unfolds.  It appears that she has had multiple relationships around the college and each soldier in turn becomes a suspect. I found the story with its exaggerations a bit much to take.  For example, the secret downstairs room fitted out with video camera and sadistic and masochistic paraphernalia.  While such might make for titillating drama, I found it highly unlikely on the army premises.  In one of the final scenes there was a conveniently placed landmine which detonated and quickly removed one of the suspects. Again great drama, but It's pushing things too far. While the story has a most unlikely foundation, some pleasure is derived from the gradual elimination of the suspects. Therein, I believe lies its chief entertainment value.",The General's Daughter
45,Movie-12,A powerful thriller with Oscar Worthy performances. ***1/2 out of ****,8,26 September 1999,"THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER (1999) ***1/2Starring: John Travolta, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton, Madeleine Stowe, James Woods Director: Simon West   116 minutes   1999   Rated R (for graphic violence, rape & sexuality, nudity, and for language)By Blake French--Based on comments by Richard Blink.	""The General's Daughter"" is a masterfully suspenseful thriller in which the audience can only try to guess what the truth is. It's a mystery film, one that works in ways beyond your imagination. The film is so precise in its dialogue, so intelligent in its story, so tense in its confrontations, and so brutal in its subject matter that this can only be described as one of the years most intriguing movies.	John Travolta stars as a Warrant Officer named Paul Brenner, who, with his partner Sara, is assigned to investigate the brutal murder of Captain Elisabeth Campbell, a rising military star and specialist in Psychological Operations, who was found tied up and dead in the middle of a battle training field. The Provost Marshall, Colonel William Kent, has called his friend, Brenner, to examine the case. 	However, this is not just any girl here that was killed. Brenner finds out that this is the daughter of retiring three-star general Joe Campbell. He is saddened and is willing to help the investigation in any way possible, but he has his own ""army"" rules that he demands Brenner to follow, which makes their search difficult. 	Things deepen when the investigation leads to an apparent rape of the victim, as it does when the two detectives dig further into the case and undercover secrets that may point to any number of suspects right there in the base, all who appear suspicious and somehow are involved with the victim. The performance by John Travolta may be Oscar worthy material it is so powerful. His scenes add punch and a jagged edge to everything in the movie. He is perfectly casted and recites his dialog in such a way that during his confronting scenes, the audience is on the edge of their seats and breathless. And not only that, but a comic touch of dramatic relief is provided by Travolta when the going gets too tough. James Woods is another performance highlight in ""The General's Daughter."" He provides an uncertain slyness to his character. One that makes the audience become involved and intrigued. Also performing on a high is the humble hearted ""Babe"" farmer James Cormwell, as the General himself, with robust deepness and a character as far from ""Babe's"" as they get. 
	""The General's Daughter"" is most certainly worth going to see at the theater, and if you decide to rent it instead of seeing it on the big screen that is still okay, but you will not receive the same effect. Who actually did rape and kill the general's daughter? I think you'll be surprised.

Madeleleine Stowe shows considerable range as Travolta's foil, simultaneously managing to be tough, sensitive and sexy.Simon West's direction is first rate showing that Con Air was no fluke. He keeps the pace moving through all the twists and turns without losing the complexities of DeMille's characters.

47,Bogmeister,Military mucks it up again,4,23 July 2005,"Travolta plays a military investigator assigned the case of the title character's murder. She's introduced briefly as an army captain and then found tied to the ground naked (& dead). But that's only the beginning of the sleazy, distasteful imagery which Travolta and his partner (Stowe) become immersed in. The whole film ends up taking a vaguely anti-military stance, chiefly due to the anti-female attitude perpetrated by the film's version of the military establishment. In fact, there is a creepy hostility towards women lurking in almost every frame of the film. And it's nothing to do with women being weaker & frailer, and therefore, unsuitable for military life. The sense in this picture is that women are to be disliked, period. And, women will ultimately be the downfall of our military. At least, that's the view of the male military in this film: the women will pervert our well-honed discipline, turning our soldiers into homicidally-inclined weirdos. Or maybe it's the military life itself under scrutiny: perhaps being in the military is an unnatural state of being; all that discipline & taking orders will inevitably cause the average soldier to break into insanity. It's tough to find much of anything to admire in this flic, be it characters or story. The list of sins slithering out from under the blanket of secrets infesting this army make the supposedly 'ultimate sin' revealed at the end an anti-climactic affair (midway, a colonel, played by James Woods, hints at a sin worse than rape). The film ends up mocking the traditional values held in high regard by the military (honor,loyalty,etc.) but does so in a ham-handed, awkward manner, also targeting the victim with gratuitous S & M footage. The anti-military tone carries to the very end when Travolta, rather than being a 'good soldier' as expected, instead decides to tell the truth - but by this time you should be laughing at the filmmakers for their warped depiction of military life, rather than at our real military.",The General's Daughter
48,Peach-2,Strong entrance...lousy entrance.,6,12 January 2000,"First of all let me say that this film blows away Con Air, the director's first film, by a wide margin. It's obvious that Simon West can shoot an action picture well, he just doesn't seem to find very good stories. The General's Daughter starts strong and gets very limp toward the end. This is one of those film's where you know that someone of star status is involved because the casting is full of known faces. Travolta seems wooden in this film. I did like Clarence Williams and Madeline Stowe's performances however and the lighting for the film was nice to view. The film looks sharp but just isn't strong enough to hold together.",The General's Daughter
49,khatcher-2,Another military investigation......,6,14 November 2002,"I have never been very keen on John Travolta, and Madeleine Stowe is OK, proficient enough without being anything special. Such that I did not expect too much from this film, and got a little more than expected.
`The General's Daughter' has its intrigue which maintains interest, despite the fact that after about twenty minutes you have a pretty good idea of where everything is leading, and at the end you discover you were about 70% right. Even so, it is a good telling of a mystery-come-thriller in a military intrigue, as well as lending more weight to my argument that I just cannot understand the mentality of anyone wanting to be a soldier at any rank, and even less when they are women. However, armies exist, and need to exist, and sincerely wish good luck to all ladies who undertake such a risky incursion into a `man's world'. Around Warrant Officer Sara Sunhill and the General's daughter Captain Elisabeth Campbell, a rather dangerous world dominated by male chauvinism rotates threateningly. You might like to compare this film with the excellent `A Few Good Men' (1992), which, without any doubt, as far as military investigations are concerned, is a far better piece of cinema. As for comparing how women fare in military scenarios, Demi Moore (again) in `G.I.Jane' (1997) gives an overheated way of looking at how the first women got into the elite regiments. I rate `The General's Daughter' somewhere between these two: I cannot be more generous than that; there were too many loose ends still floating about at the end. The photography was good, and the music, though it did tend to override somewhat at times, as if it needed to push the viewer into expectation in place of such not happening visibly on screen. Worth viewing if you are not expecting too much in the way of convincing dramatic argument.",The General's Daughter
50,SKG-2,Read the novel instead,2,23 June 1999,"I don't know why, but every year, Hollywood manages to take at least one good novel and screw up the adaptation of it.  What's amazing is many of them(JUST CAUSE, THE JUROR, others I can't think of) are thrillers, which should be easy to adapt, since they're mostly about story, or so it would seem.  Problem is, some of them are also about character, and as I believe Alec Baldwin once said, according to Hollywood, character has no place in a thriller.  But that's not the problem here, either.  Oddly enough, it's about tone.Although the novel dealt with sensitive subject matter(rape and its effects), it did so in a plain, simple matter.  The movie turns it into lurid, overheated, and unbelievable trash.  Maybe it's the fact that it's set in the South, which Hollywood uses as a cue to go Gothic as all get out, and director Simon West seems to use this as a cue to make things dark and lurid(there's that word again).  In addition, many cliches which author Nelson DeMille avoided in the novel are brought to light here.The actors don't survive this either, as they all seem to be members of Over-Acting Anonymous.  Madeline Stowe and Timothy Hutton are excluded, as they're just wasted on their roles, both of which were watered down considerably from the novel.  Only James Woods manages to give a good performance here, even though his role also suffers.  The odd thing is in the forward to the new edition of the paperback, DeMille says he liked the film of his novel.  Then again, Carl Hiaasen liked STRIPTEASE.",The General's Daughter

The film is not bad, but it's certainly not very good either. My main objection is that I'm tired of this ""Darn, I have to work with my ex-girlfriend"" theme that you can see in so many films. Madeleine Stowe wasn't very good either -- although she wasn't bad. What I am trying to say is that this is such a typical thriller and it is so average.

James Woods once again chews the scenary and Clarence Williams III shows what blind devotion can do.  The story never sags, and it keeps you going.  For films in this genre, that's always a major pitfall.  If the audience loses interest in the story, then there's really no need to finish it.

57,Magow-Intermean,The General's Daughter Review,10,23 March 2019,"Cpt. Elizabeth Campbell, the brilliant and beautiful General's daughter is found dead and naked in the centre of the army camp. Brenner and Sunhill are sent in to investigate and uncover a shocking story of gang-rape, cover-up and the General's refusal to put his daughter's welfare above his political career.
Following the lean, sensible legalities of A Civil Action, Travolta dons a creased tan suit, effects slovenly machismo and creates a weighty centre for this potty military murder mystery. Adhering to all the classical whodunnit tenets, this is Miss Marple with big boots on as military CID investigator Paul Brenner (Travolta) is on-hand to divulge the killer of beautiful, brilliant Captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), daughter of revered General Campbell (James Cromwell).
Set on the fictitious Fort MacCallum and shot in Savannah, Georgia, the format is simple: a horrific rape and murder on the base allows the army's own investigator to follow the clues, which - ber-ding! - all lead to far more than they ever imagined.
Simon West, the not untalented Brit who turned up the volume for Con Air, delivers it all with an easy slickness that befits a big Hollywood production, evoking a taut, sweltering atmosphere in the compound and shooting the flashes of action with a skilled hand. Travolta too is in good form. Brenner is an unusual combination of sharp mind, deprecating humour and overbearing brutality and is allowed a cutely underplayed sexual frisson with fellow investigator Sarah Sunhill (Stowe). And there's an enigmatic James Woods stealing scenes as an oddball military shrink who spars deliciously with Brenner.But what should be powerful and stirring is just plain ridiculous. The script (to which, believe it or not, William Goldman lent a hand) lurches between logic-defying plot developments and shameless, giggle-inducidng big speeches which are obviously designed to build some all-American heart.
By the time the bulb flashes above Brenner's head and the perpetrator is sussed (it's about 50 per cent guessable) the story has wound itself up to such a twisty turny extent, tying in all the suspects on some level and establishing such a bafflingly, deep-seated motive (clue: this girl was hardly the apple of daddy's eye), it's hard to actually give a monkey's who done it. Any ironic inflections toward the American military or intelligent feminist comment (you know, women as soldiers and all that) is lost in the muddle.",The General's Daughter

Still, there's no denying it is a well-made, well-acted effort from director Simon West (Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider). John Travolta stars as Warrant Officer Paul Brenner, determined to get to the bottom of the murder of a respected base commander's daughter. Of course very little is as it initially seems as Brenner peels back one layer of lies after another -- some surprising, others less so. The final truth is so bizarre and disturbing that even the most experienced viewers won't guess it. More focus and a shorter running time would have helped this one.",The General's Daughter
59,fimimix,"..The General's Daughter is anything but ""general""..",10,21 February 2007,"I liked this movie so much, I watched it twice, once tonight just to make sure I had the story right. There are SO MANY colonels, captains and generals in ""The General's Daughter,"" it's ludicrous to even name the actors who played them. I am from a military town (2nd World War); there were tens-of-thousands of troops from all over the world on the base, but only one colonel ran it.....a gay one, at that. This kinda ties-in the feature of this film about gays in the military - it's been around forever......One-time-pretty-boy from ""Saturday Night Fever"" star, John Travolta (CID officer Paul Brenner) really did an excellent acting-job in this movie. I was surprised to see that he had put-on a lot more weight, hard to accept about the really hot-looking guy who played in the movie named here. I've seen other films (look at ""Blowout"" for another great movie he starred in) and was aware that he was going to be heavy. I just can't see him that way.Brenner and CID Sunhill(Madeleine Stowe) are investigating the nude death of Capt. Liz Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), who just happens to be the CO's daughter. Because it took place on a military training-base, everyone is covering-up for everyone, and most of them are guilty in some way for the murder. Seems the captain was at the top of her class at West Point, and not very well-liked there - she was brutally raped by her classmates in a war-game, stapled to the ground by tent-spikes and abandoned. Her murder was a re-enactment of the rape, but with a twist which shouldn't be revealed by a review. Col. Robert Moore (James Woods in an excellent role) is the prime suspect. A military base seems to be just like a small town - everyone knows everything about everyone.....Capt. Campbell was a promiscuous lady, but I won't reveal another twist, which is the main theme of the movie. Some commenters seem to think folk in the military lead pristine lives - they apparently have not heard of, or have forgotten, the many sexual attacks perpetrated against female airmen at The Air Force Academy in Colorado.Tim Hutton (Col. William Kent) plays a good role in ""The General's Daughter"", also. We won't get into that, because he also plays a major role in the movie. Usually, I don't like too much violence in films, but this is a good story with good acting by major stars, such as James Cromwell (Lt. Gen. Campbell). To tell too much about the plot will spoil the story, if you haven't seen it yet - but should.I feel certain an alert viewer will get the point about ""abandonment"". Although I realize it's necessary for the military to train under ""live-fire"", I personally do not accept it is moral to do so with a ""live"" mine-field. I reveal this feature of the movie, without disclosing how it is used.Director Simon West and scriptor Bertolini get it all together for this film. The plot is faced-paced - maybe a little over-the-top for actual, military life - and will keep you guessing and entertained throughout the whole thing. I recommend it for all adult viewers. I have no idea how it is reviewed here so negatively by so many commenters - I say bravo !",The General's Daughter
60,Shiva-11,A few good men gone bad,6,25 June 1999,"The General's Daughter - CID Investigator Paul Brenner (John Travolta) is called upon to solve a particularly ugly rape/murder on a military base. His task is doubly difficult: the victim is the daughter of retiring general ""Fighting John"" Campbell, a vice presidential hopeful and Brenner has only 36 hours wrap up the case.   To further complicate matters, the rape specialist assigned to help Brenner, Sarah Sunhill (Madeline Stowe), is an ex-lover. Throw in cover-ups, betrayals, and some kinky sex for spice.This movie has been referred to as ""the most anticipated action flick of the summer"".  Unfortunately, anyone relying on this for their adrenaline fix, will be sadly disappointed:, the plot is weak, the overacting is painful ( Clarence Williams III as Colonel Fowler looks like he is in agony in every scene) action is AWOL for most of the movie, and the ""surprises"" aren't. Stowe's character seems to have been an afterthought, serving no purpose other than commenting on Brenners wisecracks.The only redeeming moments were the interactions between Brenner and Colonel Moore (James Woods):  the dialogue was quick, witty, and interesting.  Had Moore's character been given adequate screen time I would have definitely enjoyed this film. I would only recommend this movie for die-hard Travolta fans.",The General's Daughter

If you're up to those kinds of movies, you won't regret it. When I say ""up to those kinds of movies"", I mean those movies where there's no high action scenes or anything, is all about the plot, the acting and what's going on; and that lovely question you ask yourself on any great police thriller: ""who did it and why?""",The General's Daughter

It is too bad that it had to be wasted on this very average thriller. John Travolta was not at his best, trying to act cool throughout the film to the point of looking ridiculous. Madeleine Stowe was forgettable as Travolta's partner C.I.D. investigator, and the rest of the cast seemed like they were just going through the motions. James Cromwell was good as the General but certainly not good enough to salvage this, cliche filled, effort. The General's Daughter will probably do well at the box office which insure more and more substandard movies coming our way. Too bad!",The General's Daughter

I seldom use the term ""powerful"" because it is so overused by the media critics, but I would use it for General's Daughter.The interplay between Madeline Stowe and Travolta was one of the most original I have seen in a long time.  I can't explain too much because it would be a spoiler (for once a romantic subplot that can actually be spoiled?).A few things made this movie less than worthy of a 10/10 though.  Why does James Cromwell always seem to play the corrupt high level official?  Why isn't this movie NC-17 (depicts rape, full nudity, and other things that should NOT be viewed by children).  The military coverup concept, while possibly accurate is almost cliche.  And why do they have to list on a black screen what happens later?  Just let the movie end.But even with these flaws (which don't really harm the movie) I would still give the movie 9/10.",The General's Daughter

The main theme of rape is dicey to begin with, but the movie's confusing plot line does nothing to add to the filmmaker's stand.

That is the underlying question in this fictional account of a rape covered over for the ""good of the service"". Or was it? Travolta is at his best in this suspenseful thriller that places him between the proverbial rock and hard place. Is he a soldier first or a police officer? James Woods is equally good as the commanding officer and friend of the victim, and his position as the head of Psychological Warfare group makes him an interesting foil for the questions the investigator must ask. Madeline Stowe presents an interesting character as the skilled rape investigator who uncovers the perpetrators with a ""minimum of effort"", and her conversations with Travolta (the character's ex-lover) bring out an interesting sub plot to the film. While the other actors in the film are adequate to the plot, the main conflict lies with Travolta and Stowe, so the remainder of the cast plays ""second fiddle"". With scenes of nudity, sexual sadism, language and violence being strung throughout the film, it is well deserving of the R rating.

68,Phroggy,Some feeling redeems the whole process,7,5 October 1999,"Maybe your Phaithphul Phroggy is just a big softie after all, but I thought this movie went just beyond its exploitative, post-Joe Esterhazas-Basic Instinct-et-al status by using its components (and implausabilities) in a quite devious way. I don't think you could compare it with ""8 mm"", which was a blatantly, annoyingly self-conscious movie (though entertaining as a plain thriller) :Travolta's main emotion seems to be disgust and anger, but seems justified by his character. No Denzel Washington in ""The siege"", ""I-have-feelings-and-wants-everybody-to-know-it-since -I-can-shed-a-tear-on-the-poor-victims"" big cheese here (Though I couldn't help the nagging sensation that his part was originally written for Bruce Willis !). You don't dwell on anything romantic, the character's development is minimal - which is better, since they would eventually turn out as clichés - and the whole stuff actually works and makes us forget the numerous logic lapses for a while. The rape scene is really more disturbing than titillating, which was probably intended. Of course, in the end, you feel like with such thin motives, everybody could be the culprit (No ! I didn't do it !), but I guess that's not where the point really lied. The vision of the army is, for once, realistic : who do you think dropped bombs over Sarajevo, killing loads of innocent people ? Father Christmas types with a toothful of grins and a kid at each arms, as in the nazis/Russians/US propaganda pictures ? (Never noticed how they always use the same imagery, whoever they are supposed to promote ?) A military guy is basically someone who will shoot another person at his commander's say-so ; that's what he is trained to do and think it's the ""right thing to do"", and in order to do that, you gotta have a special mind-set, even if it doesn't turn you into a raging beast. I understand that people might not like this point of view, especially in a movie which, basically, it's just another thriller ; some others will consider it as mere theaters-fodder to be chewed, swallowed and digested in one sitting. They are right, but in my opinion, there is something like a heart beating under all those Hollywoodian, big-bucks show-off antics. So see it for yourself.And thanks to mister Anonymous who pointed out all the film's failure on a military standpoint : this is real information and reminds us what disrespect Hollywood ever had for any kind of truth that doesn't fill in their guideline. We need more comments like this ! (Oh, in case you wondered, Parisian people don't all wear berets and drive deux-chevaux, as in ""Armaggedon"".",The General's Daughter
69,cofemug,"Q: ""What's worse than rape?"" A: ""This movie.""",2,28 July 1999,"This movie was so awful.  I left the theatre one hour into it to check the time, thinking the suffering was almost over.  I had another hour to go. There were two redeeming factors in this horrid mess, and they were both only scenes.  One about four seconds long, and the other maybe one-two minutes.  This movie had ""8MM"" all over it, and that was a lot better of a movie.Plot: Rehash of a girl who was found raped and murdered while spread-eagle. I think I have seen this movie before.  Let's rephrase plot  Important girl murdered in mysterious cover-up fashion, kept hush-hush for political reasons.  Maybe this movie will be different in its style.  Nope, stole that from ""8MM"" when !!SPOILER, PLEASE MOVE TO NEXT SECTION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ!! girl is found to be S&M addict.  Also, same people are suspected. Ending different (with hopeful tone).  Nope, same dumb ending of !!ANOTHER SPOILER, REPEAT ABOVE DIRECTIONS!! that political giant being involved. However, John Travolta drives off all happy in the scene in the background to the credits.  Apparently this plot, since it wrapped up nicely, means the world is ok again.  The side-plots are no picnic either.  Is the opening twenty minutes dealing with the guns dealer dude supposed to reveal Travolta's character, or did it have no point?  Was it just to establish why he was there so we wouldn't have to suffer the accent?  Was there a point to it?  Also the romance/reminiscing between Travolta and his ex was better than the plot, though it extended the movie another fifteen minutes.  It slowed it down.  The movie could have been 90 or 80 minutes, instead of its real running time of too long.Acting: Awful.  John Travolta is a little too much as is his ex-girlfriend. Nobody in the movie really works.  Everybody is acting over-the-top.  The acting styles came from ""Con-Air.""  Surprise, the director is the same.  No real finesse.Dialogue: Bad, but not awful.  Travolta's one-liners don't work.  The dialogue is quick and to-the-point.  Therefore, it has no finesse, style, or grace.  It has some of the lamest dialogue ever written for the screen.Now for those cool scenes.  The first is the rape scene.  I know people will think that I am a little sick, but it was the only interesting part in the movie.  It was better than the acting.  It was over-the-top, unnecessary, crude, and unexcusable.  However, it was better than everything else.  Also cool was !!LAST SPOILER GO TO END SECTION!! when the bad guy uses a land mine to kill himself.  And you see it rise up and blow him away, that was a cool effect.  All in all, I couldn't stand the movie.  Please don't give money to this movie.  For those two scenes, I give this movie-------2",The General's Daughter
70,Fudge-3,Action/Who dun-it? 7/10.,7,7 October 1999,"Mostly I find myself complaining about a movie's trailer. Very occasionally I praise one. The trailer to this movie led me to believe that I had virtually already knew the plot. That could not be further from the truth. The trailer throws the audience a curve ball so as the plot unfurled I had to, ""throw away all I thought I knew.""An excellent who dun-it is the outcome.Thought...Would such an overweight Travolta really be tolerated in the US army?",The General's Daughter
71,BB-15,Military Mystery,6,1 February 2000,"I disagree with the movie critic's rough treatment of The General's Daughter. While it is an uneven mystery/thriller, it does enough things right to provide suspense and a few surprises. The first thing that impressed me was the photography showing sweeping panoramas. Also, the pacing and music fit. Once the story gets going, it has some good scenes that build to a powerful ending.One problem with the movie is that Travolta and Stowe get off to a slow start. Travolta's southern accent belonged in a Chevy Chase movie and at first Stowe and Travolta's characters are out of sync. After the first half hour, the accent and the actors get things under control. It helps that there is a fine supporting cast with James Woods, Clarence Williams, James Cromwell and Timothy Hutton. Also, new comer, Leslie Stephanson, has some gut wrenching scenes toward the movie's end. While not up to the standard of A Few Good Men, The General's Daughter has some of the same themes, career officers whose moral compass has gone very wrong. Too much of the story focuses more on sleaze than ideas. But in the end the film is a mystery about betrayal. It deals with rape in a way that's shocking but says things that needed saying including supporting a women's right to be protected from brutality.  The General's Daughter has mystery, some action and its story has some depth. The movie has problems but the efforts of many talented people break through. The story with the power of a sledge hammer presents powerful scenes toward the end making the film well worth watching.",The General's Daughter

This soon comes to and end and he becomes JT again.  The smoke and lights were the tail end of his character's last adventure - a la every Bond movie.  Still John is now the debonair army policeman.

73,Captain Ed,Some interest but overall a poor picture,4,4 October 2001,"** Some Serious Spoilers **This is another overproduced piece of schlock wrapped up in PC clothing. John Travolta, here in a middling performance, plays an Army CID warrant officer who is assigned the murder case of a young Army captain, who also happens to be the daughter of a high-profile general.  Madeline Stowe plays his partner and former love interest, a subplot taken exactly nowhere in the film.  Also scattered throughout are performances by notable character actors, chief among them James Cromwell, James Woods, and Timothy Hutton. All of these actors are likeable and have done good work.  Unfortunately, not here.While the premise held some interest, the execution is simply poor.  First, the dialogue is laughable in places.  When Travolta first meets the general, he gives what would be a wildly inappropriate speech about what a great guy the general is, all the while with Stowe looking up at him admiringly in not one but THREE shots.  It improves with Travolta and Woods and I began to hope that the film would start to improve with it.  However, Woods exits about halfway through, leaving a supposedly cryptic clue that I answered correctly immediately.  I'm not patting myself on the back here -- anyone and everyone should have gotten it.  Several times during the investigation, Travolta's character goes out of his way to insult the local police chief... but you never understand why and it's never developed.  Army personnel act as if rank is a loose guideline when addressing each other -- hardly realistic.  I could go on and on, but it starts sounding worse than it really was; it's not horrible, it's just that little effort was put into it.Typical of mediocre pictures in this genre, the film is rarely well lit, even in daytime scenes, trying desperately to give some ambiance.  Other times, it tries for hot and sweaty.  Didn't anyone ever decide what the mood was supposed to be?  It only serves to be annoying and draws attention to its sense of desperation.Then there is the matter of the victim, a veritable Job as it turns out whose idea of therapy is re-enacting a rape that occurred several years in her past.  And this victim leads a specialized psychological warfare unit? Don't you think that people in charge of such a program MIGHT POSSIBLY have to undergo some pretty intense psychological vetting first?  And since it would be a highly classified program, the sexual history of the victim would have DEFINITELY kept her out of it.  Instead, this really smelled like a way for the producers to exploit some S&M fantasies while scolding men for engaging in -- S&M fantasies! Good grief.  Very, very misogynistic fantasies at that.The ending actually came as a bit of a surprise.  However, it also was used to just serve up some tired clichés about impotent military men (or men in general). It also unfortunately gave Travolta a chance to make one last wildly inappropriate soliloquy to (or at) Cromwell in what I'm sure everyone thought would be the film's ""A Few Good Men"" moment.  It left me rather flat instead.So, to sum up, a lot of wasted talent, bad dialogue, very poor research (""You have no rights""? UCMJ, anyone?), and lousy cinemotography adds up to a bad-to-mediocre effort.  It's not Battlefield Earth by any means ... but it's farther away from ""Caine Mutiny"" and ""A Few Good Men"" than that infamous dog.  Catch it on cable for the always luminous Stowe, then pop in your DVD of either ""Get Shorty"" or ""Last of the Mohicans"" for the two stars at the top of their games.",The General's Daughter

The first thirty or forty minutes are very good, and I thought I was in for an Oscar worthy type of movie.  However, as it went on, it became more of a melodrama that tried to be powerful, but just didn't have the punch that Oscar worthy movies have.  Perhaps some acting nods will fall (as an earlier comment said, Woods' performance is brilliant) but that is about it.

75,margulanabutrlov,The General's Daughter Review,8,23 March 2019,"Cpt. Elizabeth Campbell, the brilliant and beautiful General's daughter is found dead and naked in the centre of the army camp. Brenner and Sunhill are sent in to investigate and uncover a shocking story of gang-rape, cover-up and the General's refusal to put his daughter's welfare above his political career.
Following the lean, sensible legalities of A Civil Action, Travolta dons a creased tan suit, effects slovenly machismo and creates a weighty centre for this potty military murder mystery. Adhering to all the classical whodunnit tenets, this is Miss Marple with big boots on as military CID investigator Paul Brenner (Travolta) is on-hand to divulge the killer of beautiful, brilliant Captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), daughter of revered General Campbell (James Cromwell).
Set on the fictitious Fort MacCallum and shot in Savannah, Georgia, the format is simple: a horrific rape and murder on the base allows the army's own investigator to follow the clues, which - ber-ding! - all lead to far more than they ever imagined.
Simon West, the not untalented Brit who turned up the volume for Con Air, delivers it all with an easy slickness that befits a big Hollywood production, evoking a taut, sweltering atmosphere in the compound and shooting the flashes of action with a skilled hand. Travolta too is in good form. Brenner is an unusual combination of sharp mind, deprecating humour and overbearing brutality and is allowed a cutely underplayed sexual frisson with fellow investigator Sarah Sunhill (Stowe). And there's an enigmatic James Woods stealing scenes as an oddball military shrink who spars deliciously with Brenner.
But what should be powerful and stirring is just plain ridiculous. The script (to which, believe it or not, William Goldman lent a hand) lurches between logic-defying plot developments and shameless, giggle-inducidng big speeches which are obviously designed to build some all-American heart.
By the time the bulb flashes above Brenner's head and the perpetrator is sussed (it's about 50 per cent guessable) the story has wound itself up to such a twisty turny extent, tying in all the suspects on some level and establishing such a bafflingly, deep-seated motive (clue: this girl was hardly the apple of daddy's eye), it's hard to actually give a monkey's who done it. Any ironic inflections toward the American military or intelligent feminist comment (you know, women as soldiers and all that) is lost in the muddle.",The General's Daughter

But she's certainly also the main star of this movie, even if she appeared relatively seldom in it. The second best star was James Woods.If you want to enjoy this, you shouldn't hate the army or soldiers in general, because nearly everyone in this movie is a soldier.

Among the issues I can remember from the 30 minutes I was able to watch: 1. An Army installation is called a ""post"", not a ""base"". The Post Commander would never make the mistake of calling it a base. 2. A CID Agent in the field would never be unarmed as Stowe's character is. 3. A CID Agent would never reveal their rank when introducing themselves to someone. 4. The installation in the film was extremely small yet had dozens of CID Agents. A post this small may have 1-2 at most. Many have none. 5. A local Police Chief would never come on post and confront a CID Agent about his case. 6. A Colonel in the MP Corps acts as a Battalion Commander and does not conduct patrols or guard duty. 7. A 1st Lieutenant would never be on a guard post alone, if ever. 8.

It turns out to be nothing more than an ""R"" rated TV movie of the week.A great cast is largely wasted. John Travolta merely walks through his role of the chief investigator and Madeliene Stowe as his assistant, does likewise. James Cromwell is good as the general as is Clarence Williams III as his assistant. James Woods as always, is better than his material and Timothy Hutton has little to do as the the Commanding Officer of the military police.The identity of the murderer is not too hard to figure out which detracts from the mystery element that was intended.

80,Film Dog,Stupid Plot Tricks: 'We can keep it out of the papers!',6,15 January 2000,"Ever notice how the screenwriter, through a character who supposedly knows what he-she is talking about, can sometimes introduce a plot element that, unless we sit back and analyze what has just been offered, we blindly accept?  'The General's Daughter' contains such an element:  The General's daughter has just been murdered.  Understandably, the General is quite upset and wants to keep this incident out of the media.  Therefore, he tells John Travolta, the crime must be solved in 10 days.  If it is not solved in ten days, the FBI will get involved.  This must be avoided, because unless the FBI enters the fray, the media will not find out about the murder and a successful cover-up can be accomplished.Say what?How in Hell's name does the FBI getting or not getting involved in the murder investigation have anything to do with whether or not the story becomes a headline?  The woman lives off base.  She sees people: her neighbors and her landlady, for instance (in films it seems it's always a landlady; hardly ever a landlord).  She does business with people in the local community.  She has friends.  She works with people.  Someone just may notice she's missing.  Someone may ask questions.  Then there is the matter of local law enforcement.  They knew all about the murder, and were rather agitated about the entire affair.  HELLO?  Do we not realize that local newshounds read police reports?  I mean, c'mon.  It's part of their job. And finally, there is the tiny matter of where and how the body was found (I won't give it away, but suffice to say it wasn't very well hidden).  When dead bodies are found lying around rumors start to fly, and anyone who has ever been in the military, or that matter in any job environment, knows how rumors get around.

82,critic-2,A very well done adaptation of the book,9,23 June 1999,"Despite the ridiculous comments made by one reviewer here who seems to be obsessed with John Travolta's weight and who indiscriminately and almost irrationally attacks everything about this film, I will say that it is a fine, well-acted and well directed adaptation of a complicated novel. None of the important plot details have been lost (you DO have to listen and watch attentively), something that cannot be said in some adaptations of other best-sellers such as 1976's ""Marathon Man"", with Dustin Hoffman, or ""The Prince of Tides"", in which half of the 600 page book had to be cut. All the actors are extremely well cast----as an example, Leslie Stefanson ,who plays the title role and is on screen for only about fifteen minutes, projects enough of the right mixture of beauty and friendliness to add an extra dimension of horror at the plot twists that occur later on in the story. James Woods and James Cromwell are especially excellent; Cromwell, as the general, is especially good at radiating what appears to be dignified anger and grief at his daughter's fate, but a grief that has a much more complicated side to it.I can't understand, however, the reaction of some major critics to the way the major violent event in this movie is portrayed. It's just as if they all suddenly decided to get all righteous and politically correct about violence on screen simply because the plot of this film involves women in the military. After having sat through films like ""Pulp Fiction"" and praised that film to the skies in spite of all the killings, not to mention Uma Thurman's hypodermic needle scene, why does one gruesome scene which is vital to the story shake them up so much? This film looks like ""Alice in Wonderland"" compared to the gangster and war gorefests that Hollywood turns out regularly.",The General's Daughter
83,DJ_Shilo,Lies and Coverups,9,17 August 2019,"Every year, hundreds of films are released, and some of these films give us a stellar performance from actors who are exceptional such as Travolta. He is riveting, humourous and effective in the new movie, ""The General's Daughter,"" as he tries to solve a bizarre murder, which forms the center of the story. It's is one of those films I feel will go slightly unnoticed this year because the film did not tick all the boxes, in favour of a much bigger film that did and it's a shame if it does. What's more bizarre is how the film ends and when you find out who the killer is and why I don't think the ending quite makes it, but the movie is thrilling enough to keep you involved in the story.It's about Warrant Officer Paul Brenner (John Travolta), who gets called to investigate the brutal rape and murder of Captain Lisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson) when her body gets discovered on a range. Paul works for the CID (Crime Investigation Division) in the US Army, and he joins an old flame and rape specialist, Sarah Sunhill (Madeline Stow), to discover the truth behind the strange murder. As Paul goes behind the lies of shady characters who all had something to do with Lisabeth Campbell, he finds corruption at the highest levels. As time starts to tick away, Paul discovers something that was covered up years before, which leads him to Lisabeth's father, General Joe Campbell (James Cromwell).There is a scene in the film that I found engaging when Paul is told by General Campbell, ""You're going to have to decide on this one, Paul. Are you a Cop? Or are you a Soldier?"" To which Paul replies, ""I'm a Soldier, sir."" I found this interesting as sort of a foreshadowing from General Campbell to Paul about what to possibly expect. Could the General be hiding something? Perhaps he had something to do with it? Maybe his assistant did? Everybody becomes a suspect on the base, but It becomes clear that Paul will uncover the mystery. He feels loyalty to Lisabeth to solve the murder because he met her briefly before she gets staked to the ground.It opens with Paul living on a houseboat. He is undercover as a southerner redneck arms dealer who is trying to put a freedom fighter or sorts behind bars. Once Paul drops the cheesy accent, he becomes who he is, an aggressive army cop. Lisabeth is an interesting character herself. She holds secrets that nobody would suspect her of having. Her job is to instruct ""psychological warfare"" -, or as she explains, ""we teach how to f**k with people's minds"" when she helps Paul change a flat tire not knowing who she is, The General's Daughter. We see the other side of Paul, not as a cop, but as a soldier when he brings Capt. Campbell a wicker basket of bath products to show his appreciation. When he discovers she is the body found on the range, he says, ""I met her the other day. What a shame. She was a lovely lady.""Paul and Sarah continue the investigation and discover multiple people who had something to do with Lisabeth. The investigation effort plays out as to be expected where people get revealed, questioned, and answers get revealed. James Woods plays Colonel Robert Moore, who is Elisabeth's mentor, and he shares some intense scenes with Paul before and after he gets thrown in jail. Colonel Kent (Timothy Hutton), is a Provost Marshall, doesn't do much but appears whenever something needs to be said. Paul discovers Lisabeth's secrets when he finds a hidden room in her house where he finds incriminating tapes. He also finds out something horrible happened to Capt. Campbell, during her third year at a Military College, called West Point. This incident left her traumatized, and it damaged her psyche, and we begin to see what she was attempting to accomplish. What that is I leave you to see but how this all leads to the death of the General's daughter is quite brutal.I had a good time with ""The General's Daughter."" Travolta shines in the role, but the film falls apart in the end. I am not sure if it has the same ending as the book the movie has, but this ending snags and I didn't buy it. Paul realizes who the killer is while talking to General Campbell and then confronts him on the warfare range. Of course, Sunhill gets tricked into showing up, and Paul, gun in hand, finds her trapped, and the killer gets revealed. We see this person throughout the movie. His MO does not make sense from a logical point and, we are shown Lisabeth's murder in gruesome detail through a flashback that I don't think we needed to see. After everything wraps up, we get an attempt at a twist when the last ten mins focus on General Campbell as he is preparing to leave the base. Paul clears up one loose end, and we learn the General's secrets, and maybe we had something to do with it? I leave you to see ""The General's Daughter,"" a well made and intense thriller to start the summer season.",The General's Daughter
84,maitreg,Travolta shouldn't do Southern,7,1 February 2000,"Unusual plot twist I could have done without.  It was a little too unbelievable.  It would have made much more sense if ANYONE else would have been the murderer.  The plot was so thick with possible suspects at that point...and then bring this murderer forward??  Please.Being a true Southern patriot, I've always laughed at the horribly taught Southern accents Hollywood has given us over the years.  But Travolta really takes the cake.  What's with this cringing teeth thing?  It was like he had an orthodontic brace on or something.  Geez.  Do us a favor.  Don't try to imitate us.  It is a military base, with people from all over the country with a lot of different accents.  It would be very believable if Travolta would use his natural accent.  But this whole fake Southern accent thing is absurd.  It's an insult we can all do without.James Woods was superb.  He and Madeleine Stowe saved this movie.  Thumbs up to James Cromwell as well, although, for some reason, I was expecting to see a cute little pet pig come trotting up to him in that big house :)  Overall, I give it 7/10.",The General's Daughter
85,shrine-2,It's all Daddy's fault...,3,7 February 2000,"Military service should toughen its members, yet the title character of ""The General's Daughter"" is broken by it.  She (Leslie Stefanson) is raped and can't get over it.  Shouldn't the story be about her getting over it?  Otherwise, the tragedy becomes one long droning exercise in self-pity.  Instead, it's about her getting murdered by doing something bizarre to make a point about it, and the rest of the movie finding out who and why.  When you find out, it seems even more bizarre, and not worth your time.  No one in this movie including Stefanson redeems himself; the acting is uniformly unconvincing.  John Travolta is the only one that gives us the feeling that serving in the military could give a person satisfaction or joy, but he plays it too lightly for a murder mystery.  The movie loses its needed tension when he's around.  He was able to bring it off once; has it been almost twenty years since ""Blow Out?""With Madeleine Stowe who looks like she's sleepwalking through this one, and James Woods.  Such a talent shouldn't be wasted on this drivel.",The General's Daughter

True, John Travolta did not do the great job of acting that he did in ""Broken Arrow"", but he was quite credible throughout. Madeline Stowe was also good, although her main function seemed to be as ""eye candy in tight pants"". The two actors who stole the show from the stars however, were Tim Hutton & James Woods...great performances! I also watched the alternative ending, but liked the original one much better. I have to say, (showing my maleness here...sorry ladies) that the nude scenes of the murdered girl were outstanding...quite worth blowing up with the zoom feature on my remote. A very entertaining film in all respects, I thought. The script was amazing in that while the clues were always there, the red herrings were so well done that the resolution of the murder caught me completely off guard.",The General's Daughter

The acting is decent and there are some OK supporting roles but nothing that new here as well.For me at least the thing that really made this movie was director Simon West. Coming off the success of Con Air, he does this in the same tribute to Michael Bay/beer commercial style as his previous effort. There are lots of orange filters, helicopters flying around, various shots of cool military stuff, dramatic music and slow mo close ups of things falling to the ground. They may seem to much when written down but West delivers them in a way that it adds to the experience. The cinematography too is also quite nice, often featuring something small and then going out for a larger shot. The action scenes or what little there are of them, aren't that clear but are handled quite well.A nice little thriller for a Sunday night. 7/10.",The General's Daughter

Most of The General's Daughter is by-the-numbers, but a few scenes are such clever rip-offs, they're nearly intriguing.  The brief moments John Travolta and  James Woods try to one-up, compliment, and simultaneously insult one-another are in a grandiose Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson ""Few Good Men"" style that demands that you be compelled, even if you know there's probably a more intriguing interrogatory storyline on this afternoon's Judge Judy. As for the feline factor, Madeleine Stowe comes off as the lamest leading lady since Betty Rubble, and there really aren't that many other women in the picture.  At the same time, James Cromwell, James Woods and Timothy Hutton seem to believe they're actually in a quality film, even though they must know this is fluff for the inbred masses.  Either way, I can't say I was disappointed with The General's Daughter, because I expected big-budget drivel, and big-budget drivel is what I received.  As sick as it may be, I'm going to recommend this one as a rental; if only for the Woods/Travolta scenes.",The General's Daughter

90,Imnozy,A disappointment overall,7,13 October 2002,"I expected more of this movie than it delivered.  With such an experienced cast I came in expecting something out of the box.  What it proved to be was not much more than secondrate, with thinly drawn characters and a convoluted plotline.Travolta, as ever was convincing - even if his character was an arrogant, overbearing creep - you could at least accept him for what he was. In fact there is little to criticise in any of the cast (with the possible exception of Timothy Hutton who did tend to overplay a bit). It was the general premise of the movie that is hard to accept. I know there have been coverups in the forces, but it is hard to believe that everyone involved would have gone to the lengths these folks did. Most particularly the General's daughter herself - who was presented as a  smart, intelligent, on the ball lady.  I find it very hard to accept that someone like that would have stood for being treated the way she was.All that aside, it is a movie that keeps you guessing and involved right up to the end. A violent, flawed, but ultimately quite entertaining movie.",The General's Daughter

92,greenforest56,sadly dishonest,1,15 September 2005,"'The General's Daughter' was a slightly above average flick until the very end. Sadly, at this point the film makers decided to make it a propaganda film by shamefully manipulating the audience. 'The General's Daughter' is completely a work of fiction  it is entirely made up. However, the film makers insert a final message giving the viewer the impression that it was a true story. They follow this, and reveal the purpose of their dishonesty, with a short endorsement for women in the military. In doing this they ceased to be film makers and became mere propagandists, dishonest manipulators who lie to the commoners for the 'greater good'. In my opinion, in doing so, they embarrassed both themselves and the art of film making.It is completely moral to take a true story and 'dramatize' it for a moral or ideological reason. It is also moral to create an entirely fictional story for the same reason. However, it is unethical to create a fictional story and then mislead the viewer into believing it is true just to propagate one's ideology. It is this sin that the film makers are guilty of.You may say, 'Well, everyone knows it's from a novel'. Oh, please.. There are so many people who don't read books at all and whose only source of knowledge is the movies or TV. To these people, movies and TV are the Voice of Authority. The film makers are well aware of this. Perhaps it was this awareness that led them to this manipulation.",The General's Daughter

I could maybe understand how this could receive a 7 but no not really to be honest. I've watched the generals daughter and its honestly one of the few movies I've seen that I watch over and over. If you like this movie go see the movie ""Basic"". Another army john travolta movie. I didn't do the research I don't know why he was in two Army movies involving murders. But both are great. This movie hits hard. And I love it cause its a mystery honestly. A lot of actors in here really play their part. Even the General really gives a great performance. I read in the details that john wanted his wife to play the lady detective. And that would have crushed the movie. She was a great actor. On a lot of these movies the female part is honestly too much. I guess e live in a world where in movies they know they have a female audience and don't want to upset them. They weren't worried about it in this movie. This girl had sarcasm and she was great plus not everything went her way. She added to the movie not with some stereotypical bs. This is my favorite movie by John Travolta. I guess I'm bias but he puts on a great performance. Hes the god guy but honestly it seems like hes the bad guy. Rogue does what he wants and simply doesn't care who hes talking to. He even told the police ""shouldn't you be out night sticking colored people"". The kind of language honestly you wont see in other movies. The sarcasm is through the roof. Even the female detective still puts her spice on things and tricks the guy with panties she bought at a store and then throws away. She sold that scene.Nor did the director make her out to be some beautiful unwitty girl that made you want to puke. The Generals Daughter was beautiful. And even her character surprised you with her actions. This is a movie I can watch over and over cause 1 The acting is great 2. Because it has a plot with a bunch of twist 3.

There are only a few which I will see more than once or twice. And The General's Daughter is one I keep seeing with pleasure. You will have read many reviews, scattering ratings from 1 to 10, as usual, but with a poor average rate. I personally like the movie for its excellent tempo and accompanying music. Travolta, Cromwell and Stowe fit their respective role perfectly. The global integration of filming, dialogs, acting and plot come out exactly right. So of course I try to understand why the rating is so poor. I have read criticism regarding the poor adaptation from the book, the way the army is depicted so unjustly, the average performance of Travolta and his annoying southern accent and more. Well, we have the right to our choices and own judgment. On a closing note, I wish people would stop repeating the plot in their reviews: it's boring, redundant and does not provide a bit of film analysis.",The General's Daughter
96,openeyes,Ham-fisted and overblown,3,23 February 2003,"In ""The General's Daughter,"" John Travolta plays Warrant Officer Paul Brenner, an army investigator assigned to find the murderer of army captain, Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), the daughter of a revered and politically-prominent three-star general, played by James Cromwell, in this thriller based on the bestselling novel by Nelson DeMille.Captain Campbell was found nude and staked spread eagle on an explosives test range, an apparent victim of rape as well as murder.  Before long, Travolta discovers that she aggressively explored the gamier side of human sexuality -- secretly taping herself having kinky sex with most of the officers at the base in the process.  These tapes, which could destroy the careers of all the men involved, provide a powerful motive for murder. All the while, Travolta must contend with a fellow Warrant Officer and former flame, ably portrayed by Madeleine Stowe, who serves as a rape investigator for the Criminal Investigation Division.For the most part, I have greatly enjoyed Travolta's work since his much-ballyhooed comeback in ""Pulp Fiction.""  He brought an amiable, movie-star charisma to all of his roles -- including ones in less successful films like ""White Man's Burden.""  Sadly, he isn't quite the man for this role.  Physically, he is a tad too corpulent for role of a CID Warrant Officer, but it is his inconsistent accent proves to be the main problem. The film starts with him working undercover and employing a ridiculously overstated Southern accent.  As soon as the plot allows, he abandons that accent for a gentler Southern accent which appears almost plausible until his character reveals he is a native of Boston!  Then, about halfway through the film, he abandons that accent and simply talks like, dare I say, John Travolta.The script, penned by Christopher Bertolini and Academy-Award winner William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" & ""All The President's Men,"") provides many sharply-drawn moments.  The scenes between Travolta and suspect James Woods have a crackling and unpredictable energy.  The script also plays on the prior romantic entanglement of the two lead investigators without sliding into a predictable, Hollywood-style love story.  Sadly, the ham-fisted, overblown style of director Simon West doesn't rise to the level of the script.  West, best known for the more appropriately garish ""Con Air,"" adds the worst excesses of commercial and music video filmmaking to this movie.  All scenes of action or danger are telegraphed and undermined by ridiculously unmotivated lighting.  The worst instance is the rape scene. While a character off camera tells what a dark night it was, we see lights blaring through every bush and low-flying helicopters shining spotlights on everything but the victim herself.It is precisely this pivotal rape scene which ultimately undermines the credibility of the film.  The director handles the incident with a gleeful gruesomeness.  It is almost as if he intended to titillate as well as repulse us.  West adds further insult to injury with idiotic end titles at the end of the film emphasing both the number of women in the military and their contribution -- as if this film will help end sexism and make their lives easier.  Yeah.  I'm sure it will.  Especially that rape scene.Where's ""G.I. Jane"" when you need it?",The General's Daughter

104,tingnting,Good but not fantastic,6,24 August 2006,"Question: What do you do when you have an average storyline with too many sub-plots and clichéd twists? Answer: Get an A-list ensemble cast to take the focus away from the actual story.Firstly, I'd like to say that the movie IS worth watching, especially if you're flicking through the channels on TV and it happens to be playing. It tackles the issues of female abuse in the military, corruptness of military officials, and ultimately betrayal between father and daughter. Unfortunately these themes have been explored to death in many other films, and this film does little to improve on the subject matter.John Travolta, a cocky but smart military cop with an extreme dislike for authoritative figures, leads an investigation into the death of a female military officer. As events unfold, he finds out that things aren't what they seem (what a surprise!) and that a massive cover-up has been put in place by the woman's father, a general in army, about the fact that she was gang-raped 7 years ago.The rape scene is brutal and powerful and you will land up hating all military people, which is exactly the reason why her father tried to cover up her rape. It is completely implausible that a father would cover up his own daughters brutal rape to avoid, what is ultimately, bad press.Travolta is favourite of mine but he plays his character too tongue-in-cheek, considering the subject matter. Although he is extremely entertaining, I get the feeling that he plays it lightly because he's not able to play the roles seriously. He's just not a dramatic actor and I kept waiting for him to say stuff like ""cool baby"".James Woods, a powerhouse actor if given the right opportunity, is unfortunately given a small role, although crucial to the plot. The witty remarks between him and Travolta are really what make this film worth watching.The ultimate baddie in this film is the general, played by the same actor that played the corrupt police captain in L.A Confidential. They're basically the same type of characters...corrupt and powerful. For me this was a give-away as soon as I saw him because he always plays the bad guy. Is there a more type-casted actor? He's also not particularly a powerful actor, nor was his character interesting. They could have made him a lot more intimidating...like Jack Nicholson's character in A Few Good Men. At the end you're just not sure if he was a good father who made a bad decision or a corrupt general who made a good decision.There are many characters and scenes in this move that have no real purpose. The fight scene in the beginning of the movie when Travolta is attacked by some guy that he's been investigating is not necessary. Travolta just laughs at the situation, makes a few witty remarks and leaves. The general's loyal assistant who helps him cover up the rape. has no input to the movie or storyline. The ultimate no-needer is Madeleine Stowe's character. She seems to exist just to give male viewers something to look at other than guys in army uniforms. Her character has no depth nor enough lines in the movie. Everything she uncovers could have been done by Travolta's character. The film is engaging although disappointing in the end. In the last few minutes, Travolta's character threatens to court-martial the general and following a few witty remarks, the general leaves. I can't help thinking that the movie should have centred around the court-martial instead of the actual crimes. It would have made a much bigger impact as a court-room drama then as a second-rate criminal investigation. It just feels like another episode of CSI: Miami.It's watchable only because of the A-list cast, also including Madeleine Stowe and Timothy Hutton. Ultimately the mo view hinges on John Travolta's box-office draw and charm, not his acting, to pull it off. If it featured David Hasselhof then it would have gone straight to video.Wait for it on TV, don't rent it.",The General's Daughter
105,Aberlass,An Ugly Painting set to emotive music...,8,17 June 2000,"A surprisingly stylised and artistic approach to an old theme. The smoky yellow colour tints, especially during graphic violence are very beautiful, therefore the subject matter is even more disturbing. The colour is sumptuous throughout which holds the viewers attention, even in the more routine sequences. The actors performances are rather mismatched, because some are realistic, Cromwell, & interesting, Woods, and others are plastic, Stowe, or complacent, Travolta. The plot is a traditional tale of integration and violating those the established dont want integrated, resulting in retrobution. Despite the clashes in acting style & limitations of plot, this film works! I cannot explain why, maybe a magnificent cinematographer is all a film needs, but it is riveting viewing.My Rating: 7/10 When I had just seen this film I said 8/10, but over time I digested it and realised that the performances irritated me too much to maintain my initial opinion. The main problem is Travolta, his trademark being - wonderful charisma, which some films need, but this film did not need that, I prepose that he was wrongly cast in this film. It is this aspect that dulls it's memory. But I do recommend that you see this film if you like instantaneous impact & buzz and dont care who the actors are.Who Should Watch this Film? This is an 18 Certificate, UK, you do need to be over 18yrs to understand it. There are a few behaviours regarding 'Ms Campbell' that only maturity will reveal any understanding about. Basically, men & women get the same package here, there are no subplots or romances or shoot-em-ups, it's a serious narrative. It's a film about army rape. Women will cope with the subject material because it's shot exquisitly & is very respectful towards women, and men will cope with it because problems are worked through and are solvable. If you can handle the basic premiss of the plot, then you will be surprised by the colour & sound of the film. It has the most stunning soundtrack I have encountered for a long time. The traditional African songs will blow your mind, because they do not match the visuals. I am recommending this film for the music & colour alone. It is this that will really make you think deeply.",The General's Daughter
106,prezike,A practice in film hypocrisy,5,29 February 2000,"""The General's Daughter"" is not a bad film by any means, nor it is great or even good, but this is not even the issue that bothers me with films that try to send a message.  By using the very issue that they criticize (woman in society are objects, and deal) as part of the attraction of the movie, I have a hard time believing them.  I had a similar problem with Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" where he is clearly condemning violence in society, but he also uses it liberally (not in a political sense) throughout the film.  The same tactics were used in ""The  General's Daughter"" regarding the unnecessarily graphic and exploitive rape scenes that were in the film. Now this is not to say that the use of violence and and rape scene cannot be made to send a message about the inhumanity of these acts, but it must be done in a manner where it is clear.  I feel that the message was made too ambiguous, and hurt the film.I believe that the screenplay also had much to do with this, and could have done a much better job of making the viewer feel what one should feel, when seeing a rape scene.  This was an average to below average film that did not have any where near as much thrill as a thriller should have.",The General's Daughter
107,Dr.Jolly,John Travolta heads a good movie that brings the most questions towards the military since Full Metal Jacket.,7,14 July 1999,"John Travolta leads an all-star cast in a movie that truly goes at the heart of one of Hollywood's most popular arguments (Does national defense come before someone's rights). I have never read the book, but I'm sure it is better than the movie. Regardless, Travolta is excellent as the military detective who is assigned to find out who murdered and possibly raped the general's daughter. The plot is built very well at the beginning and you actually get a sense of who the victim was before she is killed, which is something that is usually ignored. Madeline Stowe plays the rape specialist who chooses to help Travolta in the case. The movie does an interesting thing with Stowe's character, by surprising you a third into the movie by revealing that she is already connected to Travolta. Cromwell and Woods do an excellent job with their military parts and soon the mystery begins to build. Movies have become to predictable as of late, but this was an exception. I was completely thrown off and the ending is not exactly what you would suspect.The movie does have a few disappointments. Stowe is a proven actress in the past, but she shows none of the unique talent that she possessed in past movies like 12 Monkeys. Timothy Hutton continues to amaze me by how he only does well in unpopular films, because once again, with a big time movie, Hutton fails to make any impact. Overall, the plot is good and mystery lovers should like it. Travolta continues a streak of good roles that just seem to never end. Overall, I gave it a 7 out of 10.",The General's Daughter

It's a ghastly sight and everyone wants him to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible. The problem is that EVERYONE has something to hide or is hiding someone who has something to hide. This has an all-star cast and they are terrific. The story is well written and the cast has some fun with it along the way. Director Simon West knows how to tell the story with a slight tongue and cheek flavor and still maintain the very serious nature of the subject matter. The action sequences are very well choreographed and the climax is pretty intense. So if you are looking for a familiar but really good, intense, and exciting action murder mystery THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER is well worth seeing. No matter if the critics thumbed their elitist nose's at it. They're loss is our average Joe's gain. ***1/2 out of 4.",The General's Daughter
109,Curtize,Dishonorable Discharge.,5,9 August 1999,"The General's Daughter - **John Travolta stars as Paul Brenner, an army officer in the Criminal Investigation Division (CID.)  We meet him as he is attempting to infiltrate an illegal arms ring operating out of Fort MacCallum.  Undercover, Brenner uses an irritating southern accent all too similar to Travolta's Clintonesque performance in Primary Colors.  Thankfully Brenner quickly dispatches with the arms dealer (and the accent) before moving on to another case - the apparent rape and murder of Captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson.)  It is quite a horrifying scene:  Captain Campbell lies nude on the ground, cord around her neck, arms and legs spread and tied to tent pegs.  As if this case were not bad enough already, it gets worse. Brenner learns that the Captain is the daughter of General ""Fighting Joe"" Campbell (James Cromwell,) famous war hero and highest ranking officer on the base. And then worse again:  Brenner is teamed up with a former flame, also working in the CID, named Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe.)Paul and Sara engage in the requisite relationship banter as they move about the base, examining the evidence.  Their search takes them from a local deputy whom Captain Campbell dated, to Campbell's secret S&M lair beneath her house (yes, you heard me right), to the office of the Captain's commanding officer, Colonel Moore (James Woods.)  Finally, the big secret is revealed when Brenner and Sunhill pay a visit to West Point, and learn what happened to Captain Campbell there.  Much of the investigation feels rather mundane, only to be punctuated by the overly gratuitous nature of the crimes involved.  Indeed, when all of the secrets are revealed and the culprit is unmasked, the plot turns out to be amazingly simplistic, not to mention ridiculous.Which is a shame.  Because the production was well mounted.  Travolta, as always, never disappoints (once he loses the accent.)  Stowe is adequate in her small and, frankly, throwaway role.  But the man who steals the show is James Woods as Colonel Moore.  It is a small role.  Woods probably has only three scenes, comprising ten minutes of screen time.  But I found myself praying that those ten minutes would stretch out to thirty or more.  Watch closely to the scene in which Brenner questions Moore for the first time. The dialogue (no doubt scripted by cowriter William Goldman) is clever and intelligent.  But Woods' performance puts the scene over the top.  In his face and body language he is completely calm.  But if you watch his hands you can see how nervous the character really is.  The direction, cinematography, and score are all top notch.  Even the banter between Sunhill and Brenner works rather well.  But the basis for the story - the crime itself - is simply ludicrous.In short:  When you find yourself investigating a murder in a movie, ask yourself the following question:  Which role is played by a star who is too well known for such a small part?",The General's Daughter

Definelty not for the happy-go-lucky film goer as it contains some very violent scenes but at the same time, The General's Daughter was not turned into a typical adrenaline pumped action movie with no plot and lots of gunfire. This movie had some of the best scripting I've heard in a while (If for no other reason, see it for the conversations between Travolta and Woods). This movie was far from perfect as some actions lacked much motivation and some characters remained only one- dimesional. See it if you want a good movie, not a great one.",The General's Daughter
112,Dr. Don-2,"Wasted cast, snuff porn scenes, and please stop explaining everything!",3,19 June 1999,"A film with James Woods, John Travolta, Madelaine Stowe, Timothy Hutton and James (how is Babe?) Cromwell could not be missed.  And I won't miss it, having seen it -- as in, I'll dash off this review and try to forget it.I won't criticize it for being unabashedly formulaic -- which it is -- because, well, innovative and creative films are few and far between anyway. But, sheesh!, the first third had way too many obviously portentous scenes -- we're bludgeoned with them.  There's heavy innuendo whenever anyone speaks, hammed up with the kind of facial expressions so characteristic of overacting.  Further, the behaviour of the army characters was confusingly erratic -- sometimes too stereotypically puffed-up to be believed, sometimes informal enough to demand a courts-martial.Things picked up after about thirty minutes and an interesting plot seemed to be unfolding, notwithstanding a totally pointless distracting sideline -- a hokey, done-a-thousand-times-better bit of turf-war animosity between a civilian cop and the swaggering military investigator (Travolta).  The depiction of the crime scene, however, was offensive.  Panning repeatedly on the woman's nude body, lingering grisly images over and over in the rape scene, complete with graphic descriptions of how it felt -- all of this was gratuitous to the point of pornography.  This carried through to the end of the film (snuff porn fanciers, God help them, will be quite gratified, at least).Compared with the gruesome murder scenes in, say, ""Seven"", which horrify by presenting brief glimpses and letting the imagination do the rest, these scenes are drawn-out and heavy-handed.  The murder scenes in ""Seven"" left me queasy about the psychopath; those in this film leave me worried about the film director.  If nothing else, that's a distraction.If you're the sort of film-goer who likes to sleep through most of the movie and have everything explained by monologues at the end, this is your kind of film.  Leaving nothing unsaid, the last half hour is full of exactly the sort of confessions of the soul that do not ever happen in real life. People with no compelling reason to expose their career-threatening secrets -- people who have spent seven years concealing them in a cold, calculated and rigid conspiracy -- crumble one at a time before two underling investigators with little to go on other than hunches and the occasional totally illegal and improbable beating of a witness.Not content to treat us as severely lacking in imagination, the filmmakers felt a further need to tell us in a written postscript that the bad guy got his just deserts and that there are lots of women in the armed forces who are going to do just fine.  What's the point?  That despite this gang rape the military is a cool place for women?  There must be a point; this film can't resist making points.My point is, this cast is full of people who can act.  I hope each of them finds a film worthy of talented actors and actresses next time.My rating is five out of ten, including one point each for the two very funny one-liners.  Spend your money on something worthwhile and entertaining, like ""Besieged"".",The General's Daughter
113,fenoixrising,A True Military Review,9,28 February 2006,"I read one review of this film by someone that thought they were an expert in the military. They aren't. In the first part of the movie, we see Travolta as a First Sergeant (1SG) and a gun runner. He also has a fake Southern accent. This is because he is trying to gain the confidence of those selling the guns. His refusal to assist the female captain change her tire goes along with his undercover act of being a ""misfit."" Travolta's character is an Army CID agent and like most CID agents, his rank in the movie is Chief Warrant Officer (CW4). Army warrant officers serve as high level specialists in several fields. All warrants, except for aviators, can stay in the service until they are 65 years old. They are not bound by normal retirement requirements. Now as to the entire work party stopping and saluting when an officer's vehicle drove by--this is what REALLY happens in the Army. It may be different in the Marines, Navy, Coast Guard or Air Force.Now, let's go to the movie itself. It was great. The plot, the acting and the interaction between the ""normal"" soldiers and officers and the CID agents was right on. One of my favorite parts was when Travolta and his partner walked into the Officer's Club--and the place cleared out. Soldiers of ALL ranks really don't like two groups snooping around, CID and Intelligence. (I was in the later) I was really impressed as to the reality of the movie. The rah-rah, stars and stripes films DO NOT show how the Army REALLY works. This film and ""Blackhawk Down"" does. They show that's its not all spit-and-polish, snappy salutes and marching in formation. These people have JOBS TO DO! There's a time and place for the ""parade ground"" junk that most people believe goes on every day. This film shows the working Army.",The General's Daughter

115,SDJerry,There's a lot more than what's readily apparant at first.,8,25 June 1999,"Travolta is very good (finally) as a military criminal investigator who pursues a murderer of an Army captain despite impediments (official and unofficial) placed in his way.  Stowe is fine, as is Cromwell as ""The General"".  James Woods, as always, is terrific as he elevates any film in which he participates.  Sadly, however, Clarence Williams III may be the worst black actor currently working.  On the other hand, the lovely Leslie Stefanson is an actress from whom one cannot take their eyes. In addition to radiant beauty, this gal can act.  Roger Ebert and guest critic gave this film ""two thumbs down"" because of, what they referred to as, too graphic scenes of violence against ""The General's Daughter"".  They are wrong. Even my very squeamish wife found no objection.  This is a film definitely worth the price of admission.",The General's Daughter
116,piasa84047,I Guess It Could Have Been Worse,5,28 January 2003,"Though the film makers keep the solution under wraps until the end in this mystery about an apparent murder on a military base, it has a lot gone wrong that still shows up on the screen. Actually I am a big Travolta fan, so it pains me to say this, but his southern accent at the beginning of the film is more than a distraction it is so bad. Most of the rest of the cast seems out of place in the military. Andie McDowell is someone that I am not a fan of, but she actually gives the best performance in the film. The film follows the military cover up of the murder and as Travolta and McDowell, the films co-investigators and, as if this didn't seem like it rolled off the carbon copy press in Hollywood murder mystery's, former lovers. As in all films like this there are a lot of clues given to make you think you know whodunit even though you couldn't be more wrong. But at the end when the solution is finally revealed it shows just how routine a movie this is. It plays the old I know who did it but if I have a flashback now I will figure out who really did it game. And the film left itself wide open to possibilities but took the cheap, and cheesy way out, tacking on a whole subplot that we never knew existed until the very end. Too bad. If you can overlook Travolta's accent, James Woods and James Cromwell's miscasting, and a southern county sheriff storyline that is unnecessary as it advances the film none and is there only to make fun of southerners, then the movie is worth watching right up until the final 10 minutes. But that last 10 minutes kills it all.",The General's Daughter

This is one of those movies that draws viewers in and doesn't leave them even after it ends. Some people say that its end is a little hammy, but by the time it reaches there, the movie has already done a stellar work. In my opinion it is also one of the best acting performances by John Travolta. And the supporting ensemble is equally good.

119,Yipikaye,Excellent movie.,10,26 July 2016,"John Travolta gives a powerhouse performance in this twisty crime story from director Simon West (Tomb Raider, Con Air). It is a story about the brutal murder of Captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), who just happens to be the daughter of General Joseph Campbell, a high ranking and very politically visible General. The investigation that follows takes on a life of it's own as CID Officers Paul Brenner (John Travolta) and Sara Sunhil (Madeleine Stowe) uncover the victim's shocking secret life and the even more shocking reason for it. Things become more dangerous as Brenner and Sunhill uncover more than anyone wants made public and Brenner must use the full powers of his position to shake up the Military structure he is a part of and uncover the truth, no matter the cost. Whether he is a soldier first or a Police Officer may have a bearing on what he does with the truth once he has it in this compelling and complex mystery. Leslie Stefanson gives a nice performance as the very messed up General's daughter. Her dalliance into S&M with high ranking members on the base becomes sad and heartbreaking as Brenner and Sunhill slowly get closer to the truth, and the real reason she was mudered. James Cromwell (L.A. Confidential) gives another solid performance as the politically ambitious General and Clarence Williams III of Mod Squad fame has a nice turn as his loyal to the death aid. Everyone from Col. William Kent (Timothy Hutton) to Col. Robert Moore (James Woods) has something to hide in screenwriter William Golden's (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) story. Brennan and Sunhill's relentless pursuit of justice for the General's daughter makes for a terrific time at the movies. The ending may surprise you, as may the reason for the brutal crime and the events that preceded it. This is a marvelous Military mystery that works because of the fine performances and the sure handed direction that never lets your interest wane. You'll want to own this one as it begs for repeated viewings. This is a very good film all the way around and one you have to see.",The General's Daughter

I will try to find the book.With this story, the film could have been really great.  The first 15 minutes (Travolta playing Rambo)could have been better used elsewhere in the movie (Trying to explain more clearly the relation between the daughter and the father, more face to face confrontation like the great scene with James Woods, the relation between travolta and stowe etc.)  The aim is to try to show that Travolta is a good soldier and that he will do its duty as a soldier.  There are more subtle ways to show this.As a man, the raping scene made me feel sick.  It was horrible.  The father reaction was incredible but I know it can happen in this world where power and conformism is all.Travolta and Stowe were well cast.  I like Madeleine Stowe.  What a woman.

121,ZielinskiMichal321,Great movie!,10,26 July 2016,"When you see such a polarisation of opinions on a book or a film, you actually see a good work because it is making people think. This movie does that and yes, provokes violent extremes in how people perceive it. Yeah, John's accent stinks big time, but he gives one of the best performances of his career. Stowe is always beautiful to watch, an elegant actress that be oh so feminine and yet have a strong will and a mind of her own. She shines in a role that often gives her little to work with speaking of her radiant talent. Timothy Hutton is as always, a superb actor (Tim your Daddy would be very proud of you!! James Woods - what can you say - you love him or you hate him, but he is one of the best around and he gives a moving performance and the person with the secrets Travolta needs. James Cromwell is finally getting the recognition and the roles he deserves and does his very best in another unlikeable role, bringing it little nuances of a man caught between loving his daughter and the higher calling of military honour. This movie does not show the military and its treatment of its female members in a good light bringing back many such stories we have seen through the years on evening news, maybe with such graphically grim - almost claustrophobic feel that it will cause some people to dislike the film for that alone, especially in today's climate of the world.

When you think about it, the story is great, has a good premise, and has some clever plot twists, and it probably looked much like a winner on paper, but in the end it just didn't work on screen.My biggest gripe has to be the dialogue, and if you see this movie, you too will be rolling your eyes at some of the things that are said and even they way they are said. John Travolta, as much as I admire him, should never try to paste on a southern accent; it is so obviously fake. He should perhaps just stick to the Brooklyn or Boston accents and leave the southern drawls to those for whom it comes naturally (Tommy Lee Jones comes to mind).I don't regret having rented this movie, but I would have been a bit upset had I seen it at the movie theater and paid six or seven bucks for it.

This is another in a long line of bad movies Hollywood keeps churning out.  This movie was one big cliche. Senselessly and without explanation attack the local cop. Throw out one alleged tough guy line after another.  Add some stock and underwhelming plot twists. In short, provide weak entertainment for the average movie-going idiot. Enough already enough. Where have the great movies gone?  Why doesn't Hollywood put out a good product anymore?  LA Confidential was excellent, why not follow suit? Are there no good screenwriters out there? Have they gone the way of starting pitching in baseball--to diluted? I know what you are thinking, ""Enough ranting."" Ok I'll stop, but do you get my point?What was wrong with this picture, you say, let me see:  Travolta cannot speak anymore. He sounds as if he has a mouthful of marbles at all times. There was nowhere near enough plot development.  What exactly do Warrant Officers do? From where do they draw their power and how do they order officers around and continually mock them?  Why is everyone afraid of these military cop types?  What is Timothy Hutton's characters background? What was the nature of his relationship with the General's Daughter? What kind of relationship did Travolta and Stowe have/had? All questions with no real answers. This movie could have provided us an intelligent look into military detective work. It did not. We learned nothing about how military detectives ply their trade. Just how fat overrated 70's actors pontificate and throw their huge bulk around.More unanswerable questions: Why did Travolta not immediately view all the sex tapes? Why did Travolta not immediately interview James Woods character? Why did they not interview the victim's family/friends instead of heading to some local bar? Why do the police need a warrant to search a dead person's home (their privacy interests end with their death).  Why did it turn from night to day in one second during Travolta's inspection of the crime scene? What did Travolta's military ID spell sergeant wrong (SARG...)?

A really good movie, with an excellent cast, and a really thrilling plot.The movie starts with Paul Brenner (John Travolta) who talks with a sort of ""Texarino"" accent.  Later the story gives introduction to Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson) who seems to be a nice woman with order and discipline. As the story goes on, we discover the nice woman gets raped and killed, and as the investigation about her murder starts, we start knowing that that woman is not as nice as she looked but she sure had a dominant personality and a dark past.  The investigation given by Brenner (Travolta) and Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe) starts somehow confusing and as it keeps going it keeps getting less confusing.  By when the plot is getting to its culminating moment we start getting behind the truth and discovering what really happened to/with the general's daughter.This film has a really intriguing plot.  It's amazing to know what a father would chose to do to her daughter in order to keep the good reputation of an organization.  And it's amazing to know what a daughter would do to teach her father that some things can't just be forgotten.  And it's also amazing to know how many people can be involved in one simple but really serious crime.  We can just think that it's only about knowing who the victim is and finding out who the criminal is, but it's not just that.In this movie we see how much many people know and how many are blamed.  The General says, ""Just find the son of a bitch.""  Brenner answers, ""I will, sir.""  The story ends telling that just because you did not physically commit the crime, it does not mean you are not the son of a bitch.The General's Daughter is a must-see film.  It teaches, it blames, it makes you think, it entertains you.  But more importantly, it shows you what's worse than rape.  Elizabeth, the general's daughter, could forget that she was raped, could put aside that she was rape... but she couldn't forget and put aside that she was betrayed by her own father.FILM EVALUATION:  9 out of 10.  ***3/4 out of ****.ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER:John Travolta is one of my favorite actors.

Critics decried the graphic violence of this film but mostly it was suggested or out-of-focus, with just enough brief glimpses to keep from getting to be hokey or a tease. Brian De Palma or Francis Ford Coppola would scoff. (Heck, sometimes I think I'm the only one who remembers last summer's ""Saving Private Ryan""?)Travolta knowingly parodies his own (superb) accent from ""Primary Colors"" which was disconcerting until you realize the parody is deliberate. (His boss actually says, ""You can cut out the cheesy southern accent."") After all, he's playing an army investigator who might be expected not to have the same command of accents as a professional actor. We get some interesting insights into his character during his brief interviews with James Woods. We learn that Travolta isn't a high ranking (or even commissioned) officer, but that he can throw his weight around because of his role (criminal investigator).The movie has a lot of little scenes like this which serve to build the characters. And the final result is less a summer blockbuster-type thriller than a provocative look at how some of the worst crimes imaginable are not illegal.At one point the question gets asked, ""What's worse than rape?""

The director,screenwriter and Travolta (is it just me or is Travolta's over acting getting worse every film he does , perhaps we should blame his non directors) deserve no praise with what they've done here.If I hadn't read the book I would have been disappointed with the film , as i have I just hope the crew of this film never get a go at Word Of Honor (De Mille's best book).",The General's Daughter
141,Arnie-30,Formulaic but enjoyable,5,18 September 1999,"For those familiar with such military set pieces (The Presidio, A Few Good Men), 'The General's Daughter' has few surprises and no innovative twists on well-worn themes.  The characters lack depth and originality while certain plot diversions (the S&M sexuality of the eponymous 'General's Daughter' and the vague history between John Travolta and Madeleine Stowe) are merely there to pad out an underwritten story.However, despite its somewhat perfunctory development, 'The General's Daughter' remains an enjoyable, and surprisingly engrossing, experience principally owing to the performances of John Travolta, James Woods, the increasingly watchable James Cromwell and a redundant, but nonetheless engaging, Madeleine Stowe.Simon West has a good eye and there are many scenes redolent of early Ridley Scott.  Yet at times contrived lighting and set design clearly take precedence over content and this runs the risk of turning the film into an exercise in self-parody.  West has his actors to thank for preventing this gaffe.  The experienced cast are clearly aware of the limitations of their material and do not imbue their performances with anything other than what is necessary to create an efficient mystery thriller.Certainly worth the price of a cinema ticket.",The General's Daughter

Oh sure it is - its a great 'who-dunnit'.... 'who-did-it'.....and for such an excellent movie, I can't understand why this isn't repeated across our screens instead of the tired 'same old' rubbish. Casting was well thought out with almost every aspect of this area not having any stone left unturned, their reward for their efforts is that actors 'click' and it shows too ....by incorporating a very strong storyline, adding some excellent actors, very good camera-work and fine direction...a movie worth 90 minutes of anyone's time is here.

Travolta was particularly strong in this film, imbuing his Army/Police role with just the right proportions of hardness and emotional outrage. Stowes character was quiet but with a still strength. The only giveaway for the whole film was the amount of time that Timothy Hutton spent on camera.The acerbic humour was refreshing with both leads being given some great one-liners which they delivered with perfect timing.My only complaints would be the jingoistic treatment of the army life portrayed and the poor use made of James Woods character but neither did much to spoil the film at all.A recommendation for all who like well constructed films.",The General's Daughter

I am always amazed that people from countries, that have large armies, and are easily willing to use them, consider that the members of such armies are different to everyone else or other armies. The events in Abu Ghraib should convince any hardliner, that soldiers of any flag are capable of any atrocity. There are regular comments about this film that these events could never happen, but in my view, people are people, and there is nothing as queer as folk. So do not be surprised if such events ever happened, though of course it is an untrue story and therefore could ""never"" happen.Again to finish I for one enjoyed this film.",The General's Daughter
154,Shiva 22,Graphic rape does not make this turkey a drama.,4,23 June 1999,"Is Travolta a cop or a soldier?  Neither, in this poorly-paced misadventure from director Simon West.  What promised to be the best military mystery since ""Courage Under Fire"" turned out to be nothing more than a pinball game, with Travolta and the completely superfluous Madeline Stowe bouncing from one officer to the next, each with an inexplicable need to confess all he knows to the investigators.  Clues are regularly served up on silver platters, and the entire film is dragged along by the convenient action of minor characters.The plot has more loose ends than a shag carpet--the first 20 minutes of the movie are spent on a plotline which abruptly ends and is not mentioned again.  Travolta's witless antagonism of the local police chief serves no purpose other than to provide inappropriate comic relief at moments of high drama.There are a few notable performances, particularly James Woods as Col. Moore.  The only real suspense in the movie--as well as the only appropriate use of witty banter--comes during his interactions with the investigators.Notably missing in the film is the strong sense of ""death before dishonor"" that is frequently referenced but never actually portrayed.  This is at least in part due to the fact that Travolta spends half the movie in a rumpled suit trying to play Colombo, and only dons his ill-fitting uniform for the last few scenes to remind the viewer ""oh, yeah, he's supposed to be in the military"".",The General's Daughter

But in the very fact that the graphic nature was enough to make them protest it, these reviewers prove that the film did exactly what it intended to.  Many claim that this movie feels dirty, but that is the point.The plot is compelling and suspenseful, the acting is generally superb, and the script does not let down either.  This movie certainly is frightening in almost every way one can conceive of, and those that can overcome the queasy sensations they may experience at some spots will be richly rewarded with a great deal of food for thought and, for better or worse, a bounty of vivid mental snapshots from this dark, well made thriller.",The General's Daughter

158,sbsakin,"Promised a lot, delivered little",4,12 September 2009,"The movie had lots of potential. The theme is very original, the actors are good, there are some good scenes and dialogue, but suddenly the movie mixes some of the worst suspense clichés in the mix and have terrible plot twists.The first thing that annoys me is the attitude of the main characters. They are that kind of ""know it all"" people, who act the way they want just to make it seem that they are clever, and this is annoying, because, investigating military officers, if they really behaved like that, they would end arrested.There are other thing that annoys too much are the clichés. First, there is the romantic involvement of the partners (Must every suspense movie with a man and a woman investigating a case have some past, present or future romantic involvement between the partners?). Second, there is the notion of evil superiors using their force to hinder the hero's actions. Third, there is the ""army conspiracy"". Army, government and church conspiracies are so out of date in a modern world, because they are linked to middle ages thought (king = government, nobility = army, church = church). At last, the General's Daughter secret behavior, which is ridiculous, even considering that she underwent a traumatic experience. Her ways, instead of making the viewer feel compassion for her, makes the viewer feel that the ""evil"" characters were right to a certain degree.As for the directions the movie takes, the development of the investigation is predictable and the good explanations for the main suspense case are soon overwhelmed by nonsense or cliché explanations and reasons of the main characters.The worst is that they try to embrace a social question in the end of the movie (woman in US Army) out of nothing and without logical reasons to do so. It ends being harmful to the movie.The good points are that some actors are very good, some scenes are very well made, despite of the not so good plot, and the theme could have been developed to a great and intriguing suspense. Sometimes, some good segments give hopes that the movie will start picking up after some boring or cliché parts, but unfortunately it is not true and the movie goes downhill in the end.",The General's Daughter

I was excited when they were going to make the movie, more so when I knew it was John Travolta.  When we brought the movie home however I didn't like it.  My husband who'd not read the book thought it was a good movie but to me even as good an actor as John Travolta is he could not pull off Paul Brenner like the book.  I don't think it's a reflection of his acting just a reflection of the script.  If you haven't read the book then enjoy the movie but if you read it don't waste your time.",The General's Daughter
160,mansonthismadting,Very good enjoyable movie.,10,26 July 2016,"This movie is based on a military site in which they believe a murder has taken place. Travolta plays the military cop who is in charge of sloving this murder. Along the way they come under fire from all directions, with lies, deaths and threats made against them not go looking for the turth. As all good thriller movies this movie builds up the suspense right up until the very end. i thought the ending to this movie was excellent, with plenty of action and ""keep guessing"" suspense. Anybody who loves a ""who done it"" movie will like this! Having read the book by Nelson deMille, I felt I needed to see how similar to the book it was...not bad, as converting a book into a screenplay for about two hours is a difficult task at the best of times. There were about three changes, but, if you haven't actually read the book, don't worry, the film was very good. John Travolta was - as usual - brilliant, as our eponymous hero. Cracking good read.",The General's Daughter
161,Ezekielwheelwork,A Psychological Murder Mystery of the Rape of a Female Officer,9,29 August 2005,"Sometimes a murder mystery is ruined by the red herrings that are thrown clumsily into a movie to keep the viewer guessing. The problem with this is that sometimes the red herrings are unrealistic and patronising. In my opinion there is nothing of the kind in this film; it cleverly trusts the intellectual perceptions of the viewer, doesn't condescend and can be watched on a variety of levels.This has to be experienced though, it is very much an active film. The viewer knows that as the plot unravels there is a twist that has more or less been worked out by the cleverly crafted scripted dialogue. So when all is gradually revealed there is a sense of pride comes over the viewer that it was more or less worked out before the end but excitingly so; if not with a great deal of negative emotion and great sadness at the subject matter.John Travolta plays a military investigator to a believable if not slightly charismatic degree. I particularly liked how the construct of the film establishes Travolta's character early on in the film as someone who can look after himself when an attempt is made on his life: it TELLS us that this guy is nobody's fool and can handle himself. When one of his superiors on the phone tells him to drop his cheesy southern accent Travolta quips back ""Hey it's this cheesy Southern Accent that's keeping me alive!"" Madeleine Stowe plays Travoltas investigative sidekick expertly well adding EXTRA tension to a script that already has the viewer on the edge of their seat. Since they both have had a past intimate relationship with each other there is the bitter-sweet interjections that one would expect in real life which adds further gritty realism to one of the most poignant subject matters one could think of.That subject is rape. But this is no ordinary Rape and Murder. (what is?) The general's daughter who is herself highly intelligent makes an early and vital appearance in the film where she helps Travolta change a blown tire. This establishes, if not albeit briefly a chemistry between the general's daughter and Travolta which makes it more poignant when upon the crime scene she is discovered tied to the ground naked and apparently raped with the apparent cause of death, asphyxiation.The Generals Daughter herself plays a complex character; her statement, ""We **** with peoples minds"" is funny until the script quickly unravels itself to the tearful conclusion that there CAN be things worse than rape. I am not going to mention what is worse than rape but I did cautiously include a spoiler warning in case it can be worked out via this review.For me, this film explores the different rules that one establishment follows over an other: ""The right way, the wrong way, and the Army way"" And The daughter of the general's extracurricular activities, SHOCKING at first at least becomes understandable and lays bare why we sometimes act the way we do after terrible experiences.I know someone very close to me. His mother was raped and he was the result; later in life he also was raped and the result for him? Let's just say that spiteful behaviour, bizarre behaviour, strange behaviour can and usually has a reason but its those reasons that are often missed to the detriment of the ""victim"" and those who interact with that ""victim"". This is where insight comes in useful and starkly warns us that sometimes NOT EVERYTHING IS AS WHAT IT SEEMS! The daughter of the general had an enemy worse than the men who raped her. It was that enemy that drove her to the ""bizarre"" behaviour which had its own logic albeit a twisted logic, it was that logic that for her, could be used against the enemy. Her behaviour and logic and extracurricular activities even begins to make sense to the viewer. As I mentioned previously the film can be watched on various levels and people take their experiences to a film and get there experiences confirmed and expanded. With this element in focus it reminds us that we humans as a social creation like to watch films: it is like reading; we read to know that we are not alone and that can be very comforting.A GRIPPING FILM; WELL RESEARCHED; CLOSE ATTENTION TO DETAIL; WELL DIRECTED; WELL ACTED; WATCH IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN!",The General's Daughter

Being a HUGE fan of Nelson DeMille and loving the wit he puts into his characters (especially Brenner) I was highly disappointed with the movie. Travolta isn't bad but he does not fit the character in any way, shape or form. Cynthia (Madeleine Stowe) who for some reason was renamed Sarah also didn't work for the movie.I counted (I think) about 3 witty things from Brenner, where in the book it was non-stop. That's the best part about his character is that he's hilarious in his ""wit"". I give the movie 3/10. I hope I don't see Travolta's face when I read the next Brenner book.",The General's Daughter
163,absartist,A Movie That's Too Good for the Late 90's,3,19 September 2021,"Now, hear me out. This is a good plot and premise. Instead of the usual rich woman found dead in the mansion study that most mystery/thrillers are set, we find ourselves in the military barracks. Instead of a damsel in distress, a female officer in the U. S. Army is the victim of a rape/murder. We're given a realistic expose of sexism and sexual harassment within the military, an explanation given by a female to Agents during the investigation. As for the characters, that's another story. The usual suspects are the typical late 90's alpha male douchebags with the maturity of a 14 year old with neglectful parents. Travolta's role as the main protagonist is convincing and intelligent despite having a ""frat boy"" past. His main concern is the case and nothing else. Stowe's role as secondary protagonist also shows cunning intelligence and is equally selfless. But...she becomes annoying when correcting her male counterpart whenever he says something that isn't up to the cosmopolitan political correctness code. She acts like the typical 90s/ Proto-woke stereotype of a woman, cold, bossy, elitist, entitled, and devoid of humanity. She even commands that Travolta ""start the car"" as if she's the General himself. Who's in charge, here? I ask. The antagonists are not what you think even though one of them is your creepy male jock-type soldier who kidnapped Stowe's character only to blow himself up. This is where she becomes more human explaining the victim's situation before her death. The other antagonist is the General himself who covered the whole damned thing, and the victim herself (in a way) who planned to use psychological warfare due to her estranged relationship with her father. Which exposes a deeper secret in this said case.In Conclusion, this movie could be better with the characters and their development. What kills this movie is the over-the-top 90s sexist stereotypes (however subtle, compared to the Wokeness of today) that is prevalent in movies from this era. What could've been done is that Sunhill (Stowe) could've tolerated the bad jokes and chauvinism up to a point near the middle of the movie like any normal human being. Stereotypes don't belong in any mystery/thriller whatsoever.",The General's Daughter

166,JakeBlue,Not even worth the time to watch on cable,3,2 July 1999,"I am a movie buff.  I watch movies all the time and it is RARE that I will find a movie so horrific that I declare it's not even worth the time to watch.  Many movies are bad, but most can be watched.  Some movies are just not worth the time even when they're free......This is one of them.A summer movie either needs a killer plot that keeps you hanging on or enough bloody violence and explosion that lack of plot doesn't matter. This movie lacks both.The whole ""mystery"" plot is just horrifically done.  There are so many loose ends in the movie, small subplots, that just go nowhere.  There are so many characters which could have gone somewhere and just didn't.  To say Travolta was excellent is a compliment to Travolta only.  The script was so amazingly dry and rancid that only Travolta's intensity kept it going (and maybe Woods).  They would've been better off reading a cereal box side panel with that same fervor.  I would've gone nuts around Vitamin B-12 and Lecithin.The end was slapped on and completely didn't match the rest of the movie. Most mysterys have an ending which wraps up every seeming loose end.  The end of this movie looks like it was written by a writer who didn't have the luxury of even looking at the rest of the script.The best part was the first 5 minutes.  As I said, mindless action can make up for bad writing, and the fight scene with Travolta was pretty cool. Nothing else in this movie is worth it.Oh... and the rape scene and images of a naked dead girl on the ground. That was disgusting.  I love bloody movies, but there are some places you don't go, and this movie found those places all too well.

167,BJW-2,Sad(o) and masochistic being the operative words,1,2 July 1999,"Whilst watching this movie, I formed the impression that the plot was so far-fetched that the producers felt the need to insert sordid cliches and a sado-masochistic undertone to convince the viewer that is was really serious; either that or it was an unconscious admission of the fact that they hated themselves so much for making it.  It was awful.  Almost everyone was nasty and the rape scene and general's daughter's spreadeagled dead body were framed somewhat too voyeuristically for comfort - perhaps intentionally.  Questions regarding the insane manner in which military loyalty curbs notions of justice and individual rights were dealt with far more maturely, far more believeably and with far more insight, in A Few Good Men.

171,Keebler,Good acting undermined by inconsistent script,5,22 June 1999,"The movie's good acting, and quality directing were not enough to hide the huge flaws in the story and mood.  This movie dealt with extremely heavy subject matter, and asked the audience to make huge leaps in logic when it came to the hidden life of the General's Daughter.I couldn't stand the inconsistency in the mood.  Hated it in fact.  This movie asked me to deal with an upstanding, strong young woman by day who is a dominatrix by night because she was brutally gang raped, and then laugh at one liners by Travolta and Stowe.  In one scene where Travolta is interrogating a witness the guy says, ""A rape is a woman who changes her mind later."", and I gasped in disgust.  Then 20 seconds later Travolta busts out a sharp one liner, ""My Dad was a drunk, a gambler, and a womanizer, I worshiped him.""  I wanted to laugh, but felt completely guilty doing so. There were other times where I thought Stowe and Travolta were so callous for their jokes.  They would go from playful to deadly serious all within 30 seconds of each other.But that was what the script demanded them to do, so I don't fault the actors.My final problem is this:  If a movie is going to take on such deeply heavy and complex material as a woman's psychological reaction to a brutally traumatizing experience such as gang rape, then it needs to go more into the science of it.  We were asked to understand, with little explanation, that the reason this woman engaged in S & M with multiple men is because psychologically she disdains and hates men, incapable of loving them or herself.  If a film is going to attempt to cover such complex, deeply serious and personal material, it needs to take the time to credibly explain its importance.  This movie gets a 5.",The General's Daughter

Definitely worth seeing!  7 out of 10",The General's Daughter
173,Lex Murphy,Disgusting and Exploitative,3,25 June 1999,"""The General's Daughter"" is one of those films that takes itself WAY too seriously.  The acting is bad, the direction is shoddy, and the dialogue is wretched.  I pity these talented actors for having to spout lines like ""There are three ways of doing things:  the right way, the wrong way, and the Army way,"" and ""Move aside.  Man with a gun."" At its core, ""Daughter"" is a disgusting exploitation film.  It's sexist, racist, and revels in drawn-out shots of the title character's dead body. The conclusion is preposterous, the plot twists ridiculous.  At best, ""Daughter"" is a passable TV movie. I'd give it a C-.",The General's Daughter
174,jonasw,An intense thriller full of twists and turns,7,16 June 1999,"Early buzz on this film is that it's Oscar material. I would go so far as to say James Woods has a supporting Oscar pretty much clinched. Travolta, Cromwell, and the others do a pretty fine job also. The story holds up, save the extreme end, where it gets a bit sticky, but definitely worth a see, if anything, for the great performance from Woods.",The General's Daughter
175,JoeKool,Excellent!!!,9,28 June 1999,"This movie would have been a ten if it wasn't for the disturbing rape scene. Travolta is again at his finest, making me wonder ""Why has he never won an Oscar?"" Very good plot, good storyline, just an overall great murder mystery.",The General's Daughter
176,Paul-229,* * What were they thinking?,2,9 July 1999,"Just got out of ""The General's Daughter"". What a waste of talent, John Travolta, James Woods, Madeline Stowe and Clarence Williams III (original Mod Squad). The story was predictable, generally, a poor rip-off of the old Sean Connery film, ""The Presidio"", and the bad guy left no real clues, but of course admitted his guilt at the end and preceded to obliterate himself.John Travolta failed to pull off a Deep South accent, which is a shame, as he did the ""Urban Cowboy"" Texas one okay, not great, but passable. Luckily for the viewer, this lasted only the first part of the flick.This film dragged out for the first half, picked up a bit, but died on the cutting room floor. I expected quite a bit more from Simon West, who also directed ""ConAir"", which I really enjoyed.Conclusion - Wait for it to come out on video. Then wait for it to go to extended day rental. Naw, just wait for it to come out on Showtime when you're really bored.",The General's Daughter

The only thing not predictable and overly melodramatic about this pic... ...I'm a big Travolta fan, big  Simon West fan, I love movies about Military, murder, and naked bound chicks.  But did anyone put any thought into this film?  What a let down.Who did these guys think they were making this movie for anyway? 4 year olds?  PUH-LEESE.

178,jack-195,Overstrained script partly saved by John Travolta and James Wood,5,21 June 1999,"The outlandish plot, worsened by an overstrained script, needed a lot of help.  The camera work created a moody, misty background. John Travolta did well as a savvy, overaged army investigator while James Wood provided badly needed style as a psychological warfare -- no, make that a psycho warfare -- commander.  Madeline Stowe's slender, delicate beauty was totally miscast as a supposedly tough army rape investigator and rape counsellor.  All in all, a disappointment.",The General's Daughter
179,sherm-4,Another good book turned into a lousy movie,1,1 August 2000,"As a big fan of Nelson DeMille,  I was happy to see one of his books made into a movie.  That is until I actually saw the movie.  They did stay somewhat true to the plot of the book, but the little added features made it unwatchable, and took the plot from a bizarre, but fascinating story to one that was completely unbelievable.  In the book, the whole point of Warrant Officer Paul Brenner getting the assignment was that he had no connection to the deceased.  Yet, in the movie, he meets her and brings flowers.  After that, he would not have been given the case, because he had a personal connection.  Another problem was the character of Brenner.  In the book, he was a likeable wise-ass who would consider himself a soldier as much as an investigator.  In the movie, he completely crosses the line of expected military behavior and came off as some anti-army crusader.  Even CID personnel have to follow military customs.  I usually watch movies based on books with low expectations, but The General's Daughter was so bad that I didn't even want to finish watching it.",The General's Daughter
180,hal313,"Great movie, great directing, and the sets are just AWESOME!",10,19 June 1999,"From the director of Con-Air, I wouldn't expect any less then the performance that was delivered in this movie.

182,Street-3,So-so,3,21 June 1999,"It was... OK at best.  It was not the cinematic experience I was expecting, that's for sure.  James Woods did a fine job, and even John Travolta was pretty good.  The plot itself, however, was pretty bad.  All too often movies tout themselves as ""murder mysteries"" when there is no possible way to find out who the murdered is.  Such is true for this movie, where the perpetrator seems to come out of nowhere.",The General's Daughter
183,lb-24,It would even be bad as a made for TV movie,1,13 February 2000,"This is a corny and predictable film. Nothing about it is good. The story could have been recreated in a good way, but it didn't happen. All the possible cliches have been used and abused. I will never understand what is the reason that lead the director to start the movie with a fight and underwater assassination of a character that is in NO WAY related to the rest of the story, neither will I ever understand how is it possible that the investigator in chief will not even once try to find out who stole the incriminating videos from his hand.Those are only two, but in no way all of the reasons why I believe this movie is a complete disaster.

The story gets you so involved and the filming is out of this world. I love this movie. I recommend everyone go see this movie unless you are under like 10 or something. I don't know why people are complaining about the graphic scenes, come on we see more sex and nudity in other movies like Wild Things. This movie has a decent storyline and is really cool.",The General's Daughter

190,mimcat,Didn't follow the book.,8,28 June 1999,I am a big fan of Nelson DeMille.  His writing can't be improved upon by screem writer who took extreme liberties with The General's Daughter. The first 15 or 20 minutes of the movie had nothing to do with the book.  The only saving grace for this movie was the cast.  John Travolta was excellent.,The General's Daughter
191,Ice-man_,"Star Studded cast, acclaimed director.... everything you expect and more in this blockbuster. Move over Star Wars there is a new film coming to town.",9,20 June 1999,"I myself am a film student getting ready to graduate and I go to movies just to analyze them. I have followed all the actors movies and Simon West went all out on this movie. All the way from camera angles to lighting and casting this movie stands above all his others. This powerful movie delivers not just an all-star cast of actors but a actual plot that gets you involved as a viewer, gives you chills, and brings reality to a higher level.Travolta brings to the screen a top notch performance and brings his character to life in this masterpiece. Along with his star cast of James Woods, Madeleine Stowe, and James Cromwell just to name a few. Woods brought his finest work out in this movie by bringing his character to perfection. Even he himself knows he did by watching over again the scene of Travolta and himself trying to outsmart each other in the first meeting they have. This scene will give you chills alone. This film was put together in fine style and has you at the edge of your seat from start to finish. No hour long intro of what the plot is either. From the start you are drawn in by sheer drama and action. And there is more than a handful of laughs in this as well. By far I rate this in my top ten and is worth a second viewing. The ending alone is nothing what you expect let alone what you think might happen. You find yourself watching this movie asking what is going to happen next and asking who you are with yo do you think it is. I give this movie my superior rating. You will not be disappointed at this movie. 4 stars to Simon West because this movie has action, drama, suspense, comedy, and is a true thriller. Two thumbs up!",The General's Daughter
192,Ken Cook,Don't see this movie on your first date!,7,18 July 1999,"This was a decent movie that held my attention throughout and featured a solid performance by Travolta. However the plot was shaky, unrealistic and a little hard to follow.Most disturbing (as a former military person myself) was the way that the average Army officer was portrayed: Either a bumbling bureaucrat interested only in preserving the Army's image at all costs or a sex-obsessed moron who seems only interested in the next woman he can humiliate. The gang-rape that occurred in a training exercise at West Point stretches all credibility.Then we have the ""General's Daughter"" herself. She comes across in the opening scenes as a hard-driving no-nonsense officer. One whose military bearing and professionalism puts most of her male counterparts to shame. In the end, she is transformed into a pathetic ""little girl"" who perpetrates a grossly sophomoric recreation of her earlier rape solely to humiliate her father. Fortunately the strong and professional female investigative officer played by Madeleine Stow (who assists Travolta) redeems the film for women in the military.Those comments aside, this is a movie worth seeing, if just for the performances of Travolta and Madeleine Stowe. Not a movie to see on your first date however.",The General's Daughter
193,TBoone,Solid performance. Pedestrian movie,5,20 June 1999,"John Travolta turns in one of the best performances of his career, but it's wasted on an otherwise pedestrian thriller.  Technically solid in most respects, the film lacks crucial plot points necessary to distinguish it from the pack of thrillers released every year. James Woods' performance as a military psychologist is another high note, but with limited screen time, his contribution only goes so far.",The General's Daughter
194,Money-13,Entertaining...,8,5 August 1999,"After reading some of the reviews by other users I decided I needed to check it out for myself.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this film.  By no means was it ""one of the year's best"" or ""oscar material"" but was well worth the admission.  I especially liked Travolta's acting.  He kept it loose amidst a sometimes nasty story-line.  James Woods was excellent as usual and added a nice twist to the story.  There was just enough questions that the killer really isn't revealed until the proper time, which was nice. I recommend seeing The General's Daughter, but don't go in thinking it is the next great psychological thriller. *** out of ****",The General's Daughter
195,Glenn-43,Well produced pornography,3,19 June 1999,"Although well acted (esp. James Woods), the shock level in this movie concerns me greatly.  Lingering over rape scenes.  High minded about its concern for women in the military when it sends exactly the opposite message.  Truly bizarre sexuality covered with great fascination. Lingering shots of a naked woman staked out on the ground with tent pegs.  Carefully shot strangulation.   If this is what it takes to get audiences to pay attention these days, god help us all.",The General's Daughter
196,pbedore,a soft feminist analysis,7,20 June 1999,"The General's Daughter is quite a compelling film with particularly outstanding performances from James Cromwell and James Woods.  John Travolta's performance is fine, if a little uneven, and Madeleine Stowe is good, but somewhat limited by a script which is sometimes banal, particularly in her lines.  The previews have been showing the scene in which the detective asks ""What's worse than rape?""  and the answer is: ""When you find that out, you'll know everything."" When what's worse than raped is finally revealed, it's fairly nonsensical.  But also it shows a very limited understanding of rape.  And it perpetuates the notion that rape is a physical act bounded temporally by the frame of sexual intercourse. The social and emotional circumstances surrounding rape ARE rape, and portraying rape as a physical act, and the resulting trauma as something else (ie. ""betrayal"") is a dangerously reductive interpretation.Nonetheless, some really outstanding acting, and a few very compelling scenes in a mediumly-scripted version of what I've heard is a brilliant novel.  Also interesting portrayals of some ""aberrant"" sexual behaviour...all bound up by the theatricality that seems to be an inherent part of army life.",The General's Daughter
197,kshub,Great Story!,8,21 June 1999,"The movie was good, just as good as the book that I read years ago. They really didn't need to include the past relationship with John Travolta's character and Madeline Stowe's character. It ruined the ongoing buildup of the movie. I did not care for their bantering. What was the point? They did not need to develop these characters, they only needed to solve the murder. I still think John Travolta is terrific.",The General's Daughter
198,seawolf-5,"Excellent murder mystery, very suspenseful, very intriguing",10,21 June 1999,"Excellent movie.  Outstanding performances by the feature players.  Special accolades go to John Travolta, and Madeleine Stowe.  Leslie Stefanson also played a very emotional and important role in uncovering the motive behind her character's  murder. Mr. Travolta's performance is excellent and rivals his performance in ""Face Off."" It was also good to see Madeleine Stowe in a role of substance that permits her to keep her clothed through the entire movie. She should be getting meatier roles that display her dramatic range as a strong female. A definite departure from some of her earlier films.",The General's Daughter
199,jademren,Travolta pulls it off nicely...with help,7,6 July 1999,"I guess since I never saw Broken Arrow, and couldn't stomach Face/Off, it's hard for me to imagine Travolta in a flick like The General's Daughter. But to my amazement, he actually pulled it off. I'll admit, he had a lot of help. The screenplay, while not as complex as I'd like (it IS, after all, a summer release), had enough twists to make me question my first (and second) assumptions as to ""whodunnit."" Add to that the subtle innuendo between various characters and a plot that can't quite decide if it's pro- or anti-Army and there's enough substance there to back up Travolta's conflicted-soldier-with-a-rebellious-streak portrayal of Warrant Officer Paul Brenner.This is not a one-man show, however. Madeleine Stowe, while not exactly dazzling, complemented Travolta well and wasn't blatantly obvious in her character, as so often happens with female roles in this kind of movie. Leslie Stephanson was superb as Capt. Elizabeth Campbell (I wish they hadn't killed her off so soon), as was James Cromwell as her father, the General. James Woods, as always a master of his craft, gave heart and soul to the otherwise thin Colonel Moore, rounding out the cast beautifully.All in all, my expectations were exceeded and then some. I suppose it helps that I had low expectations, but The General's Daughter surprised me by actually being worth my time and attention.",The General's Daughter
200,Aldg,To me a sleeper that turn out to be an excellent movie,10,9 March 2003,"When the General Daughter came out in the theaters and later on video, I ignored this movie thinking that it was just another John Travolta movie and nothing would be gained by watching it.One of my neighbors loaned me the video tape of this move and I watched it yesterday (March 8, 2003) and to my surprise, this is truly an excellent movie.All aspects of this movie from the directing, acting and special effects are very professional.  The story line is really what is interesting about this movie.  This is a ""who done it"" filmed in the finest traditions of Hollywood.Others have written here about the story line so there's no point to rewrite old hash.I suggest that if you haven't seen this movie, go to your video store and rent it or look for it on the premium cable TV channels.  You won't be disappointed with this movie and it may give you some new respect for the acting qualities of John Travolta.",The General's Daughter
201,sharper-3,Inattention to military details,4,16 February 2002,"I believe  the armed services have special offices to provide guidance to movie producers on uniforms, aircraft, etc.  The services are not required to provide this assistance, and they may have refused to do so for this movie which portrays a general officer in a less than favorable light.  But apparently the producers couldn't afford to pay for their own military advisor.  The uniforms were screwed to the wall, and they used a Marine Corps helo to bring the Army general in in the opening scene.",The General's Daughter
202,malibujohn,Wasted cast.,2,21 December 1999,"What a waste of a talented cast. This is one of the worst big talent movies I've seen in long time. On a scale of 1 to 10, this film rates a 2.  The script is simply awful and the dialogue is needlessly  crude. Travolta is miscast or at best misdirected in his attempt to play the brilliant and quick witted  investigator.  Stowe's character has no relevance to the plot and adds nothing to the film. Sadly, Travolta and Stowe suffer from a complete lack of chemistry and the other actors appear stiff and awkward.  It seems the director had no clue about what kind of performances he wanted from his actors.  A poor script and a lost director lead to performances that have no rhythm and a film that has no direction.  I found myself laughing at all the wrong moments.  A real stinker.",The General's Daughter
203,ayardley,Don't waste your time,2,27 December 1999,"As an active duty US military member I was aghast at the gross misrepresentation this movie made of the military investigative and judicial processes.  There were several inaccuracies and I can only reason that there wasn't enough money in the movie's budget to pay for a military advisor.  I don't know where to begin, just suffice it to say that I watched the entire movie with my jaw resting in my lap.  If you've been waiting for this to come out on video, at least you didn't waste $7.50 at the box office--if you were a poor soul who saw it in the theater, well, I am sorry...the producers of ""The General's Daughter"" owe you a great debt!By the way, did somebody mess with Travolta's bite?  He seemed like he couldn't talk without his teeth clinched together.",The General's Daughter
204,ssyggy,A good story idea that went awry.,4,23 January 2000,"Although I did not stop watching it, I got very annoyed at the lack of clarity in the relationships in the film.  It felt as though the film had been produced by a committee, or that it was shot with one idea in mind, and in the editing phase, changes were made perhaps to ""save"" what could be saved of the film.  Just very disappointing.  Quote from my spouse:  ""It was convoluted and gratuitous.""",The General's Daughter
205,kd0yz,"Very interesting, keeps you guessing.",10,28 January 2000,"I was intrigued and kept guessing who and what all the way through.  It kept me interested and on edge.

A good story, well told that will keep you interested all the way through.",The General's Daughter
206,carlcurtice,No Military Advisor?,2,23 March 2001,"I saw this movie more than 18 months ago and have been pissed ever since because I wasted $7.00 to see it. A very bad movie with a huge amount of wasted talent. Travolta is mired in a role that is poorly written, but makes a valiant effort to recover from the script. Woods is always great (excluding ""Killer"") and I will watch any movie Stowe and Cromwell make. What really made me vote ""2"" for this movie was the way the military was presented. I'll be willing to bet that the Military Advisor didn't come to work most days. Soldiers driving HMMWVs off-duty in Dress Blues? Never! Changing a flat tire in those Blues? Are you serious? A CID agent telling a soldier that, ""You're in the Army, you don't have any rights."" Try reading the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Military people have more rights than American civilians. Soldiers on a live-fire ranges wearing soft caps instead of helmets would never happen. There are so many obvious falsehoods in the movie that there is not enough space to list them here. Having read several other reviews I can understand how other people, with no military service, could have overlooked the unrealistic portrayal of the Army and enjoyed the movie. But for me, with 23 years of active Army service, this was just a bad portrayal and a bad movie. Shame on the Military Advisor for letting the Director get away with so many falsehoods about a great institution.",The General's Daughter
207,katie-rayson,Rape scene,9,6 June 2007,"The film was altogether very interesting but at the same time tragic, especially the gang-rape scene which left me incredibly disturbed. The storyline is amazing and is enough to draw someone into the film even if halfway through and the direction of the film is very well done. The characters were very convincing and the acting of both the daughter and John Trovolta's character was unbelievable. The point at which the daughter was told not to talk of her rape - you could actually see every emotion through her eyes, enough to make anyone break down. Although the whole plot of the film was based around a young, murdered woman, it did cast a very negative view on how woman are treated in the US forces which could be seen as unfair. Although this is true, it did show a very valid point of how, in any job, men still value themselves as having a 'right' to be in the job over women.",The General's Daughter

Just like the Lord of the Rings comes to life in its excellent movie version. The movie is as fast-paced as the book. The casting here is superb. John Travolta brings out the sarcastic humor and self-confidence from the book excellently. Stowe's portrayal of Sunhill is not as dynamic as I would have expected, but the emotions and feelings from the book come through for all the characters. Of course, much of the book was skipped and modernized, with new scenes added. This combination is truly superb. Some people (and authors-Rowlings for Harry Potter) want the movie to be 100% equal to the book. Movies are a different media altogether. There is no time for deep character development and long historical perspectives. In The General's Daughter the movie has done a superb job of choosing material to include(some detailed and others cursory) and adding scenes not in the book.

The movie is only a shadow of the original book and as such its hard to be objective about the movie. When you finally get to the part of Kent in the end and he just gives it up, its like, how pathetic can this get? The story of building the case against him in the book was more involved than this entire movie. And then, he blows himself up? Friggin Hollywood. Maybe its just not possible to make a good film out a book like this. I dunno.
