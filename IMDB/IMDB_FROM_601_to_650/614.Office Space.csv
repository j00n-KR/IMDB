0,MartinHafer,"An excellent comedy...I just don't understand it obtaining ""cult status"".",8,7 September 2009,"OFFICE SPACE is an irreverent comedy that makes fun of the inanities of work--particularly in a cubical-ed office where the bosses are morons (not that any of us have ever worked in such an environment, mind you). The film is made up of lots and lots of weird personalities and the stars are Peter, Michael and Samir. Oddly, however, the idea for the film came from a wonderful little animated short by Mike Judge in which the only character was Milton. In other words, while Milton was the inspiration, in the film he was a purely secondary character--though he also was, in my opinion, the funniest thing in the movie. Like Judge's cartoon, in the movie, Milton is completely stepped on and ignored as he mumbles. No one notices that he's mumbling about burning down the company and killing people!! As for the plot, it all revolves around trying to find the best way to work the least and yet keep from getting fired. Michael and Samir haven't mastered this, but Peter, in a funny twist, accidentally hits on the key for not only goofing off and keeping your job but also actually getting advanced in the company! There's a heck of a lot more to it than this and I advise you to watch it--it's very funny, well written, directed and acted.Here's a final observation. OFFICE SPACE is a very, very good comedy and I enjoyed it very much. However, sometimes I wonder why some films become cult hits and others whither and fade. While OFFICE SPACE didn't do well at the box office, on video and DVD it has already sold 108,902,023,093 copies (and counting). On the other hand, another Mike Judge film that bombed at the box office, IDIOCRACY, also bombed on video and is as popular as leprosy---why is this? I loved both films, but given a choice, I would prefer to see IDIOCRACY and so would many of my friends...yet OFFICE SPACE is the cult hit. I sure wouldn't have been able to predict this--which shows you why I'll never get a job in the film industry (they'd go belly-up in no time).",Office Space
1,TheLittleSongbird,Great comedy that gets better with each viewing,9,24 June 2011,"I personally would have liked the film to have been a tad longer, however that said it is an excellent film. The cinematography and direction are both rock solid, the cast helped by great characters do wonderful jobs, alongside Friends and The Iron Giant Office Space is one of the better projects and roles Jennifer Aniston appeared in and the story is very interesting and well paced.But it is the humour and writing where Office Space really soars. Consistently the writing and humour in Office Space is hilarious yet surrealistically truthful as well. Also this is a film that for me gets better and better every time I feel, I find something new to admire and to smile and laugh at each time.Overall, Office Space is a great comedy. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Office Space
2,SnoopyStyle,So much fun,8,27 September 2014,"Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) hates his job fixing the Y2K bug. His friends Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) also hate their jobs at the cubicle offices of Initech. VP Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) is the annoying boss in charge. Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) is the weirdo working in the next cubicle. Peter is obsessed with waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) working at the local restaurant Chotchkie's. He's still trying to work it out with his girlfriend Anne (Alexandra Wentworth) under hypnotherapist Dr. Swanson. His next door neighbor Lawrence (Diedrich Bader) is loud and inappropriate. Lumbergh brings in consultant Bob Slydell (John C. McGinley). Dr. Swanson hypnotizes Peter but dies after giving him a suggestion. It completely relaxes him and changes his attitude. Anne breaks up with him and he asks Joanna out on a date. He's painfully honest with the consultants and they promote him. When he discovers that Michael and Samir are getting fired, they decide to change the accounting system to embezzle money using a virus like Superman 3.This is such a fun slacker movie. It skewers the silliness of office work. Mike Judge, who is best known for Beavis and Butt-Head, does a great job pinpointing the weird life of an office. Every other scene has some kind of fun digs. Ron Livingston is a great slacker and he's also a great chilled guy. Jennifer Aniston is actually charming and she gives somebody the finger. There are so many great wacky characters. Stephen Root is hilarious. O-faced guy Drew is memorable. This is a fun easy sly movie.",Office Space
3,Prismark10,Loose change,6,29 November 2018,Not many films can get away with stealing a plot line from Superman 3 but Office Space manages it.The film is for all office workers who commute to work and have to deal with middle managers.Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is always 15 minutes late for work. He works in IT but spends his days staring at space. He pretends he is doing something and tries to avoid his smarmy boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) who is looking for him to make him work at the weekend.When some consultants are bought in by his employer. Gibbons and his friends Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) figure that their jobs are at risk.After becoming even more of a slacker when he goes under hypnotherapy. Gibbon concocts a plan to make money from his company by using an IT glitch. He also finds out that he is in line for promotion when he is brutally honest to the consultants and he starts going out with waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) who works at a nearby restaurant.Office Space has some oddball characters such as Milton who is always being moved to worse cubicles and constantly mutters that he will burn the office down if he is pushed too far.It is an offbeat satirical comedy about the tediousness of work. Most people hate their jobs but get used to it to earn a living. Livingston is not strong enough as a comedy actor. I think the script is at fault for not making him likeable enough and the film needed to be funnier.,Office Space
4,claudio_carvalho,Life in an American Office,6,29 August 2010,"In the Initech office, the insecure and bored Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) hates his job and the abusive Division VP Bill Lunbergh (Gary Cole) that has just hired two consultants to downsize the company. His best friends are the software engineers Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) that also hate Initech, and his next door neighbor Lawrence (Diedrich Bader). His girlfriend Annie is cheating on him but she convinces Peter to visit the hypnotherapist Dr. Swanson (Michael McShane). Peter tells how miserable his life is and Dr. Swanson hypnotizes him and he goes into a state of ecstasy. However, Dr. Swanson has a heart attack and dies immediately after giving the hypnotic suggestion to Peter. He dates the waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and changes his attitude in the company, being promoted by the consultants. When he discovers that Michael and Samir will be fired, they decide to plant a virus in the account system to embezzle fraction of cents in each financial operation into Peter's account. However Michael commits a mistake in the software and instead of decimals, they steal a large amount. The desperate trio tries to fix the problem or they will go to prison. ""Office Space"" is an ironic comedy about life in an American office. The characters are stereotypes of people in company and it is always possible to find someone similar to a colleague or a situation that the viewer might have lived and that is the reason why most of people like this film. Some jokes are universal, like the feeling of having a bad case of the Mondays. This is the second time that I watch this film that is overrated in IMDb. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Como Enlouquecer Seu Chefe"" (""How to Craze Your Boss"")",Office Space
5,kosmasp,Different Space,7,14 February 2021,"Certain things here have not aged well - but they almost entirely have to do with technological aspects of the movie. Like computers and disc drives ... I doubt some people who might find this because they found out about Friends (Jennifer Aniston is in this), are now watching this.That aside the comedy about a simple office worker and his colleagues are rebelling against the forces that are putting them down. Now they don't just wake up one day and go for it ... no something has to happen for that to become reality ... but as you may well already thought, this is not the end of it.A lot of funny situations occur and the movie is quite well made, with very fine acting and dialog to boast. I'm still surprised that so many think or liked this as much as they do. Usually small budget comedies are not so popular ... I reckon Jennifer Aniston may have something to do with it ... even if she isn't that much in it",Office Space
6,lee_eisenberg,"um, yeah, if people could pay attention to this movie, that'd be great",10,22 April 2016,"""Beavis and Butthead"" creator Mike Judge spun another clever tale with this story of some disgruntled employees who decide to get revenge. Peter (Ron Livingston) is a drone at a software company who starts disobeying the company's rules, and then gets co-workers Michael (David Herman) and Samir (Ajay Naidu) to participate in a scheme. If this sounds a bit like ""9 to 5"", it's because both movies shred the corporate world. Probably the funniest scenes are whenever the unctuous boss (Gary Cole) talks, usually beginning his sentences with ""um, yeah"" and ending them with ""that'd be great"" (he's since spawned an internet meme).Judge repeated this swipe at the corporate world with 2006's ""Idiocracy"", depicting a future America devoid of intelligent thought and mindlessly sycophantic to corporate products. Both are movies that you gotta see.",Office Space
7,jboothmillard,Office Space,5,23 April 2017,"I had seen the poster for this movie numbers of times, I knew obviously the setting, but I was just looking forward to finding out more for myself, written and directed by Mike Judge, creator of Beavis Butt- Head and King of the Hill. Basically at a company called Initech, programmer Peter Gibbons (The Conjuring's Ron Livingston) is frustrated and unmotivated at his job, his co-workers include software engineers Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), who also hate Initech, and meek collator Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) who is mostly ignored by all in the office. The staff are constantly mistreated by management, especially by the boss, smarmy and obnoxious vice president Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), whom Peter loathes. Peter's agitation is increased by the arrival Bob Slydell (Scrubs' John C. McGinley) and Bob Porter (Paul Willson), two consultants brought in to help the company through downsizing and outsourcing. Peter is persuaded by his girlfriend Anne (Alexandra Wentworth) to attend an occupational hypnotherapy session, therapist Dr. Swanson (Michael McShane) puts Peter in a trance, to feel calmer at work, but the doctor dies of a heart attack before he can bring click his fingers. Peter wakes up the next morning newly relaxed, he ignores repeated phone calls from work, and from Anne, who angrily admits she had been cheating on him and breaks up with him. With his newfound calmness, and skipping work again the following day, Peter decides to ask Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress at nearby chain restaurant Chotchkie's, out to lunch, they bond over their shared loathing of idiotic management and have a shared love in the TV show Kung Fu. When Peter does finally show up at work, he casually disregards office protocol, including violating Initech's dress code, taking Lumbergh's reserved parking space, refusing to follow directions, and removing a cubicle wall, the consultants however are impressed by his attitude and promote him. The consultants confide that Michael and Samir will lose their jobs, Peter relays this news to them, the three of them decide to get even by infecting the company's accounting system with a virus designed to divert fractions of pennies into a bank account, they believe the transactions are small enough to avoid detection, but over time it will result in a substantial amount of money. At a barbecue, Peter learns that Joanna slept with a colleague, identified as ""Lumbergh"", he assumes it is his boss (this also seems to trigger the end of his calm state), he is disgusted and confronts her, and she questions his financial scheme, they split up. Peter discovers a bug in the virus Michael created, it has caused them to steal over $300,000 in only a few days, a more conspicuous amount, because Michael put a decimal point in the wrong place, meanwhile Joanna stands up to her boss at Chotchkie's about the stupid flairs policy and she quits. Peter discovers that the ""Lumbergh"" Joanna slept with is not his boss, he admits to her that the laundering scheme was a bad idea and plans to take responsibility for the crime, Peter and Joanna make up. Peter writes a letter confessing everything and slips it, along with travellers checks for the stolen money, under Lumbergh's door late at night. The next morning, Milton has become more and more dissatisfied with his treatment by management, to the point where he mumbles threats about setting the building on fire. Peter fully expects to be arrested arriving to work, but instead he finds his problem solved, the Initech building is on fire, and all evidence of the missing money has been destroyed. In the end Peter finds a more satisfactory job doing construction work, with his next-door neighbour Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), Samir and Michael find work at Initech's competitor Initrode, and Milton lounges on a beach in a Mexican resort, he mumbles threats after complaining about his beverage. Also starring Richard Riehle as Tom Smykowski, Joe Bays as Dom Portwood, Kinna McInroe as Nina, Todd Duffey as Chotchkie's Waiter, Greg Pitts as Drew and Orlando Jones as Steve. The cast is made up of mostly unknowns, Livingston does well as the bored office worker, Aniston is beautiful and likable, and Cole is suitably irritating as the dreary boss, it is a very simple story about people in an everyday mundane job, and some of the silly routines and rules of the workplace, the jokes are mostly droll and obvious, it does slow a little towards the end, but overall it is an interesting and amusing unconventional satirical comedy. Worth watching!",Office Space
8,ccthemovieman-1,One-Joke Unappealing Movie,1,7 November 2006,"This is a one-joke movie that gets tiresome after a while - employees stuck in a cubicle battling nerd-ish employers.I enjoyed the lead actor, a no-name performer by the name of Ron Livingston. He played ""Peter Gibbons."" The rest of the characters in this movie did little for me. There is way too much profanity in here. Many times I can put up with it, but it was just too unappealing here.This was written by the creator of ""Beavis And Butthead"" so that ought to either encourage or discourage you from watching this. If that doesn't help, how about a gangsta-rap soundtrack? It should have been used for torture rooms, not for movie-goerrs to endure.",Office Space
9,rmax304823,Bartleby the Nerd.,8,19 June 2008,"I was called away and missed the last half or so of the film, except for the final few minutes, so I can't judge accurately how nearly the film fulfilled the promise of his first 40 minutes. But it was coming along very well indeed.Ron Livingston, who works with a computer in a cubicle, just like everyone else in his office, is dominated by the suavely domineering boss, Gary Cole. Boy, is Livingston sick of his job, just as he's been dragged down by his ""trite and meaningless life"". He sees a hypnotherapist for some temporary relief. After inducing the trance and telling Livingston he will no longer worry about what happens, and before being able to tweak the post-hypnotic suggestions, the therapist drops dead and leaves Livingston in a permanent go-to-hell mood that even has him smiling benignly at the therapist's fallen body. Two investigators come to downsize the company and Livingston is in the land of Cockaigne. He is the only worker to tell them the flat-out truth. He doesn't give a damn about his work because the job is stupid and he's not motivated. The visiting execs take him for a brutally frank and perceptive subordinate. He's promoted.Livingston has the talent and, equally important, the right comic face for the role. He's a presentable-enough young man but his jaw is slightly large for the rest of his features and it lends him a dumb appearance.So far, so familiar. The guy who is somehow altered by circumstances so that he refuses to conform, is taken as a non-paradigmatic genius by others, and is subject to many comic situations. Just offhand, I'm thinking of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode with Jack Carson, Peter Sellers in ""Being There"", a desperate Jim Carrey comedy. And, boy, there is hardly any more unpromising material to make a funny movie out of than a sterile office. ""Bartleby"" was able to do it.""Office Space"" might have fallen flat on its face once it got past the first couple of funny scenes because, after all, unless there is talented writing behind the plot, a sense of progression, what you're left with is a single joke. I'd like to think this one did better than that, that it hit its mark. The morning after his transformation, a Saturday that Livingston has been ordered to spend at work, he shuts off the alarm, ignores his boss's phone calls, and sleeps until the afternoon while some vibes on the score give us a gentle, dreamy, and beautifully syncopated rendering of ""Beautiful Dreamer."" The writers did more than just rob Livingston of his ability to pretend he cared. Jennifer Aniston has some comic moments with her boss too, and her uniform. She's a waitress in one of those ""cute"" chain restaurants like Chili's and she's required to wear a minimum of 15 buttons (""flair"") on her uniform. The buttons are incredibly vulgar -- pictures of Garfield and whatnot. Her boss earnestly talks to her about her flair. She protests that she's wearing the required number of buttons. Yes, but 15 is the MINIMUM number of flairs. Chester over there is wearing THIRTY-FIVE flairs. So she'd better shape up. And Steven Root is sublime as Livingston's co-worker whose desk is always being moved (four times in one day) and whose Swingline stapler is always being snatched away by Gary Cole, leaving Root only a Boston stapler.I hope the film as a whole measured up to the part of it that I was able to catch. I'm looking forward to seeing Act II when I can.",Office Space
10,blanche-2,Take this job and shove it,7,31 October 2009,"""Office Space"" is a 1999 film written and directed by Mike Judge. It has a young cast which includes Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Diedrich Bader, David Herman, Ajai Naidu, Steven Root, and some old pros - Gary Cole, John McGinley, and Paul Willson.The story concerns office workers who want to get out of the daily grind. One of them, Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) doesn't want to work, and the other two (Herman and Naidu) are about to be fired. Michael Bolton (yes, that's his name) has a program based on a plot line in Superman 3 - diverting the leftover fractions of pennies from the company payouts into their own account. It works a little too well; Bolton thinks he put a decimal wrong. They panic.Judge must have worked in an office, because he has the worker drone bit down perfectly - the machinery that doesn't work, the boredom, and the clueless bosses. When Peter talks to the efficiency experts, he informs them that he only works about 15 minutes a day. Anyone who works in an office knows that there are indeed people who put in just about that amount of time, if not less.Aniston wasn't a big star when this film was made - she plays a waitress who starts going with Peter.Nice twist at the end of this small film, and the message is, life's too short not to find some happiness, either in what you do for work or outside of it.Anyone who has ever worked in an office will love this film.",Office Space
11,Quinoa1984,Intelligent satire; one of Judge's best works to date,9,4 March 2001,"Mike Judge made absolute perfection with Beavis and Butt-head (both the TV show and movie) and while King of the Hill wasn't the best (a tad too sitcomish), it was in good tradition.  Now comes Judge's first live action feature, and it is a funny and smart film in the vein of Michael Moore's projects.  It stars Ron Livingston as a over-worked guy who works in a cubicle nearly every day of his life.  That is until he getsb hypnotized and his whole attitude changes from unhappy to strangely happy, to wanting to have utter revenge.  Watchable the whole way around with everything in check, and hey, Milton is really memorable (I want my stapler, oh oh, uh, I burn the building down).  One of the funniest and better films of 1999.  A",Office Space
12,jotix100,Acerbic look at the work place,10,27 November 2006,"Mike Judge knows quite well the characters he has gathered in a fairly large office. It could be anywhere in the country. Most of us spend most of our lives doing jobs that are not rewarding and they become a dull routine. In large places, like the one we see in the film, some of the supervising personnel are pompous and love to bully the people under them, which is the case with Bill, the coffee drinking supervisor, who loves to make Peter's life miserable with the petty little details, like not having the reports with the proper cover sheet.Milton, a lonely man, seems to live to go to work. He surrounds himself with the right things to put in his time at the job. One of his prize possessions is the red stapler that the cruel Bill, takes away from him, leaving him sort of naked in the office. There are also Samir and Michael Bolton, the only friends Peter can rely on, especially in the long coffee breaks they must take just after they have arrived at the office.Peter is lost in this milieu until two things happen to him. First, is the therapist that hypnotizes him and then proceeds to drop dead right in front of Peter, leaving him in a state of Nirvana. The other is the appearance of Joanna, the friendly waitress of the restaurant where the friends meet. This young woman is the one that brings Peter out of his shell as he falls for her big time. Joanna, who is made to wear about fourteen different pins in her uniform, is also dissatisfied with her own life until she finds in Peter a kind soul mate.Mike Judge, who wrote and directed this film, presents all these characters without making them stereotypes. We all have known them, in some form, or another, and yes, we can identify to the life they live because we have been exposed to most of these characters in our working lives.Ron Livingston makes Peter a personal triumph. He clearly understood his character and plays it without making a caricature. Jennifer Aniston was another surprise in the film. Her Joanna is one of her best screen work. Stephen Root makes a wonderful Milton, the strange man we have met before in our own life. Gary Cole is perfect as the supervisor without a clue. David Herman and Ajay Naidu are seen as Peter's office pals.We had not seen this film since its release and on second viewing it still holds our interest thanks to the excellent material Mike Judge wrote for the occasion where we see ourselves and our co-workers in the big screen.",Office Space
13,Hey_Sweden,"Yeah, if you could just watch this movie, that'd be great.",7,8 June 2012,"First off, this reviewer should say that he himself works in an office and, like anybody in this position, can readily appreciate the way that debuting film director Mike Judge (creator of the animated series 'Beavis and Butt-head' and 'King of the Hill') hits some things right on the nose. Granted, for comedy purposes things get exaggerated, but there's still the grain of truth that many of us can recognize.And we can sympathize with office drone Peter (Ron Livingston), a man frustrated with the monotony of his job and existence and the ultra annoying personality of his boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole, in a now iconic performance). Peter, whose co-workers and friends include the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), finally decides to say *beep* it and do as he pleases, including not showing up for work. However, this backfires when two consultants (John C. McGinley and Paul Willson) see this as the actions of an under appreciated employee in need of a challenge.It really is great how ""Office Space"", now seen as a true cult comedy, takes its satiric jabs at the less than appealing details of our jobs, as Peter's new love interest Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress, gets taken to task for not having enough ""flair"" (decoration, in other words) on her uniform. (Judge makes a funny cameo as her boss.) Judge is able to poke fun at other various ideas throughout, such as apartment living (Peter and his neighbour Lawrence (Diedrich Bader) can hear everything the other does).It's not that the movie is ever truly uproarious, but it certainly is very likeable and it's enthusiastically performed by its cast. Stephen Root is particularly good as Milton, the ultimate office nebbish, a mumbling, subtly creepy guy (first seen in Judge's animated shorts that inspired this movie) who was in reality fired without anybody bothering to tell him but who stills gets a pay cheque anyway thanks to a payroll glitch. One watches this guy and just waits for that moment when he will snap.Overall, good fun and well paced, with a fairly amusing resolution.Seven out of 10.",Office Space
14,LeonLouisRicci,Semi-Flop InitiallyA Gem Almost Everyone Missed & Now Rediscovered,10,21 September 2015,"Virtually Ignored at the Box-Office, Barely Breaking Even, this Sharp Satire is a Winner on all fronts and has since become a Cult Movie and its Reputation has Grown Yearly.Mike Judge Delivers a Low-Key and somewhat Subtle Film that is Written with a Dry Wit and almost Deadpan Display of the Human Condition, Circa 1999. It is the Cubically Challenged Software Designers that are Clustered away in the Corporate Scheme of Things that are the Subject of this Intellectual Comedy.Everything here seems to Hit all the Right Notes and Nothing Distracts from its Relentless and Smoothly Paced Entertainment with a Twist Ending.

15,Boba_Fett1138,Most excellent comedy.,9,3 September 2003,"This movie is a rare good comedy that unfortunately not many people know.The movie is full with crazy and awesome characters such as Milton, Bob & Bob, Brian and many more. The cast portrays the characters excellent. Especially Ron Livingston grabbed my attention, before this movie I only knew him as Capt. Nixon from the mini-series ""Band of Brothers"" but I now fully appreciate him as an actor, he was the perfect leading man. The character of the mumbling Milton is the funniest even though his role seems in the beginning totally superfluous, his character plays an important part in the ending. However the character of Bill Lumbergh is the best, he's excellent portrayed by Gary Cole, he plays a stereotype office boss.There is a nice comical story with some great moments and some nice dialog. Especially all the Milton scene's are priceless. But was that whole Jennifer Aniston thing really needed? No, It could have done without the love story in my opinion. There was no point in having one.The movie starts of a bit lame but keep watching, you won't be disappointed.Very recommendable, especially if you work at a big office yourself.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Office Space
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The horrors of a desk-job and working with Windows 95,7,8 January 2005,"I'm not a big fan of Mike Judge, seeing as the characters he's created, Beavis and Butthead, have inspired a lot of teenage slackers, and I can't claim that I've really seen one single joke or gag with them(the two characters, not the teenage slackers) that has made me laugh. Granted, I haven't seen that much of them, but that's not the point. I'm not a big fan of him, but I must admit, he made a pretty funny film here. From what I understand, this is pretty much the only real movie he's done(everything else he's done is animated), and considering that, he does a pretty good job. However, too often the humor goes too low, and Judge reveals what I suppose is his strong hatred against certain typical types of people(high-level executives, popular cafeteria workers, etc.) by overusing them to the extreme. There's a scene where one such character appears out of nowhere and does something out of character for no actual reason. Maybe it's Judge trying to get a cheap laugh out of the audience, but more likely, it's him expressing how much he hates these people. I guess he worked places like that when he was younger, and wanted to lash back. Then there's there occasional out-of-the-blue low-brow joke and/or reference to Beavis and Butthead... it just takes away from the otherwise great film, and it's a damn shame. The plot is very good. A disillusioned and worn out office desk-job worker gets tired of his work, and decides to stop putting any effort into it. What happens surprises him... he gets promoted. His two best friends and co-workers get fired, though. So they decide to get back at the company, through a carefully designed virus that will steal so little money at a time from the company that it won't get picked up on. The pacing is pretty good, but some jokes and gags drag along... the very first joke of the film lasts about three minutes of the film(that's what it felt like, anyway). The film lacks the feeling of progression of the plot that most films have(and need). The pacing is all laid-back and slow, which has you feeling that nothing really happens in the film, leaving you just waiting(and hoping) for the next good joke or gag. The acting is good. The characters are for the most part well-written and credible, but some are like aforementioned lashes at certain people by director/writer Mike Judge. The humor is often very good(the many stabs at Windows 95 are great, and often accurate) but there are many things that just seem thrown in. Several characters have one or two lines but no actual effect on the plot, and could easily have been written out. Many of the characters are clichés and stereotypes, but in some cases they are accurate representations of the real thing, so it's acceptable. Two of the best examples of this are Lumbergh, the executive, and Milton, the paranoid psychotic worker. I really want to believe that there doesn't exist people like that out there, but I can't claim that to be true. Something I was a little disappointed in was the almost criminal under-use of John C. McGinley... he was great for every second he was on-screen, as always. Part of the reason for watching the film was that he's in it, actually. Same thing goes for Diedrich Bader... this guy is hilarious in the ""Drew Carey"" series, but here he only gets a few good lines. The cinematography isn't great, but it has its moments. One thing that is brilliant is the way the ""virus-installing"" scene plays out almost like a professional bank-robbery; in constant slow-motion, the guys looking around, checking for witnesses, giving each other a few knowing looks and the attempted slickness of them passing the disk... pure genius. Definitely worth watching, but not necessarily one you want to go out of your way to see or own. Unless you love Mike Judge and/or Beavis and Butthead-humor. If that's the case, you wouldn't want to miss this for the world. A good attempt by Judge, but his inexperience shows. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Mike Judge's brand of humor, or anyone who's ever worked a desk-job and/or worked with Windows 95. 7/10",Office Space
17,view_and_review,I Worked There!,7,21 December 2020,"From the brilliant mind that brought you ""Beavis & Butthead"" and ""King of the Hill"" is a Dilbert-like movie except funnier. The Mike Judge created ""Office Space"" takes all the stereotypes of working in an office and puts them in one film.
Peter Givens (Ron Livingston) was a depressed twenty-something working a dead end job for Initech. He had eight bosses and no future. There didn't seem to be any way out of his rut until he saw a hypnotherapist. In mid hypnosis the therapist died of a heart attack leaving Peter in a blissful careless state. From then on he didn't care about his job and he had the courage to ask out Joanna (Jennifer Aniston). It was a string of careless hilarity that many of us can only dream about.The drama began when Peter, Samir, and Michael devised a ""Superman III"" scheme (could also be a ""Hackers"" scheme) in which they planned to filch fractions of a penny from every transaction of the credit union.Oddly enough, this movie was based upon the ""Milton"" animated shorts by Mike Judge. Milton (Stephen Root) was a hilarious character in the movie though only a tertiary character. He was important to the plot but Peter, Samir (Ajay Naidu), and Michael Bolton (David Herman) were the most crucial characters.I think I liked ""Office Space"" so much because I could identify with it. Though briefly, I worked in a very similar office for a major telecommunications company. It was a soul crushing, claustrophobic, mindless job that had similar aesthetics to Initech. Just to see a former job setting represented on screen was worth the watch.",Office Space
18,AlsExGal,If Dilbert were a movie ...,9,8 January 2012,"Office Space highlights the absurdities of the modern day workplace, and the high tech workplace specifically. Everyone at computer software company ""Initech"" hates their jobs, especially Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) who feels trapped in a treadmill of unrewarding monotonous work as he rewrites and tests other people's software to insure it is Y2K compliant. Simultaneously, he feels equally trapped in a relationship with a woman who treats him like an unsatisfactory employee. Peter represents all of the 25-35 year old white collar workers who know they are not doing what they want to with their lives but simply find initiating a complete career change as too scary, as if anything could be worse than what they are putting up with already.I'm positive that someone involved with this movie has a deep understanding of working in software, because I easily recognized each of the various types of people represented in the cast - even the psychotic coworker, Milton, who keeps coming to work when they move his desk to the basement and stop paying him. Gary Cole's performance of Bill Lundburg hits the bullseye as the boss that understates in a calm voice everything that he wants, but then has no problem firing people if they don't meet his understated demands. What seems like a post-it note is actually a subpoena, in Lundburg's eyes. One of my favorite scenes is when he is having everyone come in and basically beg for their jobs by justifying their positions. One older worker only seems to have one function - to carry the requirements from the requirements writers to the software engineers. When the bosses try to probe more deeply into his skills he gets angry and bellows ""Are you blind! Can't you people see I have valuable people skills!"".Ultimately, Peter and his coworkers bungle a scheme to embezzle from the company by writing a program that extracts fractions of pennies per iteration. Instead of producing many very small checks, the program winds up producing one huge check that is bound to attract attention. How does all of this work out? Watch and find out. Highly recommended.",Office Space
19,Uriah43,"""Um...Yeah""",7,30 December 2016,"This movie concerns several employees who work for a large company called ""Imitech"" which has recently hired some efficiency experts to institute downsizing procedures. For the most part these employees hate their jobs because of a supervisor named ""Bill Lumbergh"" (Gary Cole) who pretends to listen to them but makes it obvious that he has his own agenda and doesn't care about them in the least. In one particular case an employee named ""Peter Gibbons"" (Ron Livingston) seeks out a marriage counselor to address some of his problems with both work and his relationship with his girlfriend, ""Anne"" (Alexandra Wentworth). It's during this time that he is hypnotized into a relaxed state-of-mind for which he is accidentally not awakened from. This results in a totally different mindset for him which changes his relationship with everybody and creates all kinds of problems for those around him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, even though they had minor roles, the two characters who really stood out were ""Milton Waddams"" (Steven Root) and Peter's next-door neighbor ""Lawrence"" (Diedrich Bader). Both were extremely hilarious. In any case, I thought this was a pretty good comedy and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Office Space

Title is a satire onto itself meaning expansion. These people want more out of life than the limitations they feel from their cubicle entrapment. It is a refreshing concept that examines the personalities that inhabit it. Ron Livington plays the sly Peter who is so fed up with work that he claims to do only 15 minutes of actual work per day. David Herman displays the frustration of Michael Bolton who hates his name due to references to the famous singer. Stephen Root is hilarious as the mumbling Milton whose desk is constantly moved and his red stapler is taken away. Strangely enough Milton solves the plot problem yet gains no more respect for it. Gary Cole is excellent as the calm and cool boss who addresses Peter about T.P.S. Reports and issuing work on weekends. Jennifer Aniston plays a waitress whom Peter strikes up a conversation with and eventually asks out. She is commanded to wear 37 pieces of flair on her uniform, which frustrates her. David Herman plays Michael Bolton whose name is his personal anguish. Director Mike Judge supplies the screenplay with clever dialogue and an interesting array of characters as well as an observant portrait of working life and its ever present routine.

21,HotToastyRag,Pretty depressing,3,12 June 2017,"For the depressed depressives out there, this movie will become your new best friend. For everyone else, well, it'll be slightly funny the first time you see it, and then every subsequent time your depressed friend makes you watch it with him, you'll cringe and start counting down the minutes until it's over.A man hates his job. His boss is a pain. Tale as old as time, right? The man goes to a hypnotist to help his depression, but he never snaps out of his trance. All of a sudden, he's free to speak his mind! He can stop going to work, talk back to his boss, and ask out that hottie waitress he's been eyeballing all week.This is definitely a guy movie. The premise, the characters, the music, everything about it is geared towards men. The one female character is played by none other than the darling of the 1990s, Jennifer Aniston. Naturally, she stands by her grungy, callous, loafing boyfriend no matter what. I think a better title for this film might have been ""Every Man's Fantasy"".Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

I have worked in offices for years and I totally recommend this film to all office employees. I love Ron Livingston's character as the unhappy coworker ready to explode any minute. When he finally changes after being hypnotized, he becomes a happier person. He gets to tick off his boss most of all. I love the beginning where everybody bothers him about the TPS report covers like they are the most important things in the world. When the company begins to screw around with their employees, watch out for Milton, he's brilliantly played by under-appreciated Stephen Root. The monotony of the offices, cubicles, and the life it creates is not what God put us on earth for is exactly what this movie searches for. These characters are more real to me than anything I have seen in the movies or television. I know what it's like to loathe Mondays and wish to be left alone to stare into space for hours at a time. I know slavery didn't end in 1865. It just took a different form. I am one of the lucky ones because i work for the state. But I feel for those companies that once created family oriented environments. You can sense the desperation. While I enjoy the movie, there are laughs along the way. MAD TV alums Orlando Jones and David Herman also star. Jennifer Aniston plays a waitress who sets Ron Livingston's character on the right path. I loved Gary Cole as the annoying boss.",Office Space

Office Space is Mike Judge's scathing rebuke of the tyrannical corporate culture, conveniently delivered via late-'90s workplace comedy. Herein is a fine collection of first-rate character actors given incredible dialogue to work with and a sense of humor that suits this setting to a T. All of these middle-managers are equally loathsome, yet I can't tell you how many times I've quoted them in real life.This is worker-bee wish fulfillment that's second to none, a temporary salve for those desk-jockey blues; an ageless revenge fantasy.

25,StevePulaski,Trapped in the cubicle,8,27 December 2011,"Mike Judge is one of the most down to earth and creative directors still working today. His ability to showcase real people in real life situations without going over the top or unrealistic is very reminiscent of Kevin Smith's style. He has a way with dialog and antics, but they never seem to spiral out of control. Unless they're antics in his cartoon Beavis and Butthead which are perfectly acceptable seeing as its a cartoon and it can do virtually anything it wants.What makes Office Space a great comedy is not only its energy but its situational elements. The characters are funny because they innocently find themselves trapped inside unfair and biased situations. This makes it relatable on another level seeing as many people who have worked in a corporate office building or some job that possess sickening monotony find solace and wit in this film because of its situations they themselves have experienced. Even if you are perfectly content with your job, you hate some recurring aspect of it. We all do. It's inevitable and human nature. Office Space points out those annoying clichés in day-to-day life and shows people they're not alone.The story focuses on a group of innocent white collars who work day in and day out at Initech, a computer company where people work in cubicles and are run by their excessive and unfair management staff. We have Peter Gibbons (Livingston) an unsatisfied employee who works himself dead to be met with more work on the weekends. Michael Bolton (Herman) who is constantly referenced to the famous pop singer of the same name. Samir Nagheenanajar (Naidu) who hates the fact people can't pronounce his last name. Milton Waddams (Root) a mumbling, paranoid worker who is constantly displeased with workers constantly borrowing his favorite stapler and is plagued by his thoughts of committing arson. And last we have Bill Lumbergh (Cole) the boss of the whole operation.One day, after being forced by his girlfriend, Peter sees a hypnotist who attempts to make the lad more fond of his job. Putting him in a state of explicit relaxation, the overweight hypnotist dies of a heart attack before he can snap his fingers leaving Peter feeling relaxed all the time. He ditches work on the weekend because he ""doesn't feel like it,"" and continues to be insubordinate and rebellious somehow landing him a higher job position.When he informs his friends Michael and Samir their jobs are on the line, they devise a plan to funnel money into their accounts to get revenge on their accursed jobs. And the rest of the film is a bunch of homages to recurring computer errors and countless jokes.That would make Office Space a satire and a very intelligent one I might add. Even though Judge has made very popular, mainstream shows and movies, he proves he can still connect closely with the everyman which is why he is proved to be a unique filmmaker. Again, referring back to my Kevin Smith comparison, he is an actor who can make a nice setting built with innocent characters who are unfortunately stuck in lackluster situations. It's a hard thing to do, but Judge embraces the challenge.Office Space comes with character actors galore and makes for an interesting setting study for people interested in the monotony of the corporate lifestyle. I can see the spoiled will find the humor quite dry and tasteless. Here's a reference I feel they may get; the humor was made for the Nick Nolte's of the world. Not the Richard Dreyfuss's.Starring: Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, David Herman, Ajay Naidu, Diedrich Bader, Gary Cole, Stephen Root, and John C. McGinley. Directed by: Mike Judge.",Office Space
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,Who doesn't want to do these things?,10,5 October 2005,"I loved ""Office Space"" and I see many others love it too. I think because we can all relate to it, the beginning with the traffic sequence, I was thinking ""Ahh! I just went through that the other day"". Also when the friends were talking about what they would do with a million dollars and Livingston's character said ""I'd do absolutely nothing"". It sounds lazy, but come on, I'd do the same thing. I'd like to stay in bed instead of going to work or school. I think many people would like to do that as well.I loved Milton, he was without a doubt my favorite character. He was just so hilarious and sympathetic. Lumberg, he is so much like my boss, always rather going at other people's conveniences than his own. I loved how Jennifer Anistons's boss kept on giving her a handful when confronted about her ""flair"" at work. I just felt for all these characters. This is a great movie that should not be missed.

Ever stopped going to work?""Office Space"" is a genuinely superb and playful parody, that plays on so many every-day things that you start laughing like crazy. Who wouldn't like to take the office fax machine out to an open field and smash the bejeezes out of it? Who wouldn't like to just stop coming to work and get promoted for doing so? Who wouldn't like to ignore their boss' calls? Who wouldn't like to ignore their boss?Peter (Ron Livingston) does all of this in ""Office Space,"" a hilarious real-life parody that deals with something not many films do: Work. In this case, Peter works at Inotech, or something ending in ""tech,"" where there is an odd assortment of characters, including his boss who talks just like your boss, with really weird expressions, and Milton, a stuttering, mumbling, glasses-wearing freak whose office cubicle gets moved so many times during the duration of the film, we eventually see his desk in the basement. (Where his boss tells Milton to get down on his hands and knees and get rid of their roach infestation problem.)One day Peter just decides that he no longer feels like going to work, and so he stops going, simple as that. Soon his pesky boss is calling him every few minutes, but Peter ignores the calls. Soon he goes in for an interview with casual clothes on, and the interviewers, so impressed by Peter's casualness, actually give him a raise. But Peter then finds out they are firing his friends/co-workers, so Peter and his two friends use a scheme to rob the Inotech company of ""fractions of a penny."" Peter says he heard of this before, and his friend says, ""Yeah, they did it in 'Superman III.'""That's one of the things I love about this movie. The way the characters are so blunt. I love when Peter's friend says about how the penny-taking scheme was used in ""Superman III,"" because I don't believe I've ever heard a character in a film reference another film's identical plot so bluntly. Director Mike Judge really puts everything out there, he doesn't hold back. Other films might wink at ""Superman III's"" plot, but he actually references it, and like I said before, I don't think that I've ever seen this done before or since.""Office Space"" is the victim of clever writing. It is based on animated shorts called ""Milton,"" and I can't say it's too surprising as all the characters in this film could easily be cartoon characters, especially Milton. Most of them have dorky glasses, moustaches, and greasy hair. They all look like weird hybrids that could only spawn in the office cubicles. The director, Mike Judge, creator of ""Beavis and Butthead,"" gets some clever things in this film. The best scene in the entire movie is when three office employees take a broken fax machine out into an open field and smash it up with a baseball bat. One of the employees gets vicious with the thing, smashing it with his foot and jumping on it. The other two men, including Peter, have to restrain him.Anyone who has a job should see ""Office Space."" Anyone who likes funny stuff should see ""Office Space."" And that's that.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",Office Space
28,thesar-2,"Make ""space"" for this true-life ""office"" in your collection",9,2 December 2009,"I ended up seeing Office Space three times in the theatre with three different groups of people. Absolutely not to discourage anyone from seeing this, but no one thought it was funny. Make that, they specifically stated they ""didn't get it."" Of course not. Not one of the three groups actually worked in an office. At that time (1999,) I had only worked in a cubicle work environment for 3 years (sadly, to date, it's been now 13 years) and I already knew how true this movie was. And still is.Office Space is divided into three separate movies: 1. a live-action Dilbert film, 2. A fantasy, one that most of us office drones dream of, and 3. real life, for the most part.Personally, I loved the whole movie, but it does lose steam after awhile. The fantasy part, or mid-section, is a little over the top. Yeah, I get the main character, Peter, doesn't care due to an unfortunate blessing in the first part, but what he does (i.e. pulling down a banner in front of everyone) to show his distaste for the place would be pretty much an immediate termination in the real office world. Then, again, that's why that's the ""fantasy"" part.The movie begins with Peter on his way to work, stuck in traffic and you immediately know he's unhappy in life. Peter arrives at work, a software company, and things continue to go downhill. In fact, things never pick up until his possible-cheating girlfriend convinces him to go to a hypnotherapist who promptly gets Peter to forget his worries, enjoy life all the while having a heart attack. Peter is so relaxed, it doesn't faze him that a man dies right in front of him.Peter's attitude positively changes as downsizing begins in his firm and due to his (finally) real honesty, he gets promoted (this, of course, falls under the fantasy segments) and his closest hard-working buddies get canned. To get back at the company, Peter organizes a (literal) Superman III plot of stealing half-cents, which of course turns for the worse. (As a life-long Superman fan, and Part III ranks as an absolute guilty pleasure of mine, I always enjoy that segment.) Oh, and all the while we have Milton (the character, like Dilbert, was reason the movie was made) who always threatens to burn down the building and waitress Joanna (Aniston – who, again, can never rid herself of ""Rachel"" from Friends) who is the object of Peter's obsession.There is a lot more, but let me tell you this: this movie is so incredibly true with its characters from an office, the real-life situations (man, did they have a camera in my offices I've worked for?) and the politics that follow. Currently, I now have seen this movie probably two dozen times and laugh out loud while shaking head each time.Sadly, not only do I know many of the workers in this movie in real life, I resemble a lot of them myself. Peter, mainly, but I do, unfortunately, share qualities of a few others. One I don't, however, is the love for rap music. That, and the movie wandering a bit in the mid-section, is my only distaste for the movie. There's more music that could have been entered into this movie, but they chose rap for the entire movie.That said, everyone (but, of course, ""Rachel"" once again) did a great job, especially Cole (as the boss) and Livingston (as Peter.) I already thought Cole did an excellent job as ""Mr. Brady"" in the Brady Bunch movies, but here he does even better as 90% of bosses I've worked for. As for Livingston, he did such an incredible job at the character he was portraying, it was almost depressing on how much I see myself in him and his speeches. Unfortunately, I can't live in the fantasy world he visits (in the middle to end of the movie) because, this is, of course, real life and I do need my job.As for the quotes! Every job I've worked for, every department I've been ""moved"" to, every employee/friend I've encountered knows these quotes, any quotes, by heart. I could say ""Hello, **enter in any name**, what's happening?"" ""TPS reports,"" ""PC load letter?"" ""O-face,"" ""Case of the Mondays,"" ""Did you get the memo?"" ""Is This Good for the Company?"" or ""I have a meeting with the 'Bobs'"" and every single person I encounter will know exactly what I am talking about and laugh. Even my bosses. The only other movie, comedy or not, that I can say that about is Airplane! and even then, not everyone know those quotes, Shirley, but they know Office Space's.This movie ranks very high on my favorite comedies of all time. I honestly don't think you need to work in a cube, but I guess it helps. Tell me how many times a boss hasn't come up to you and said what they said to either Peter or Joanna? It's funny in the movie, but so incredibly sad that it happens in real life. I mean, is there a book managers/supervisors read or forced to read that tell them to say some of this crap? (Side Note: I understand this is fiction and a spoof, but if you were to rob your business on the day you're scheduled to be fired by planting a virus to shift fractions of a cent into a credit union account, would you seriously check the bank balance at an ATM? Sorry, I just thought that was funny. Nice job on the sunglasses, though, Peter.)",Office Space
29,bowmanblue,The office worker's bible,9,25 June 2018,"As I type this, I'm actually sitting in an office being paid to... well, NOT write film reviews (clue: my job involves spreadsheets - yawn). In fact, I've spent much of my adult life sitting in offices looking at spreadsheets while getting paid a bit, but actually trying to make my stay in my swivel chair a little more enjoyable than it actually is. In short... I can totally identify with the characters in the low budget adult comedy 'Office Space.'It predates Ricky Gervais' 'The Office' (or Steve Carrell's slightly later US version) and, although both TV shows expands on what it's like to sit in the same chair at the same boxed-in desk for most of your waking hours, 'Office Space' did it first. And it also did it in a more 'succinct' kind of manner. It didn't have multiple series to flesh out its characters, so, although we may get a few more stereotypes here, doesn't mean they're any the less able to be identified with.It's about... you guessed it - an office worker - just an ordinary guy at an ordinary desk in an ordinary workplace (that could have been filmed around my very person right now). The difference is, that, after years of towing the line and doing what he's told - no matter how unfair - he decides he's had enough. And, by doing so, becomes the hero of everyone in a similar position (i.e. me). He does what so many of us only dream of doing - he rebels and tells his bosses to... I'll let you use your imagination.'Office Space' is great. It's a comedy for adults which plays on many of their very existences. I haven't watched it for a while, but now I have I'm pleased to say that it holds us as well today as it ever did. As long as there are middle management bosses who get their employees to do more work for the same money this film will always be relevant. And, from the twenty or so years I've been sitting here doing just that, I can't see this film EVER not being an accurate portrayal of modern life.Oh, and if you need any additional motivation to watch this - it also has Jennifer Anniston as an equally put-upon waitress, who shows that you don't have to sit behind a desk to be exploited and degraded.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have 'TPS reports' to get on with.",Office Space
30,g-bodyl,Witty Satire!,9,14 July 2013,"I heard so many good things about Office Space so I'm pretty surprised how this movie didn't do all that well at the box office despite some rave reviews. This movie is a witty, sharply-written satire that makes fun of the daily, monotonous office life. The characters are well-developed and you feel like you know each guy. The film has some big laughs but I think the ending could have been slightly alternated.Mike Judge's film is about a guy named Peter who is an employee at Initech and he is open about is disdain for his job. He does his very best to get fired from his job and get away from his infinite amount of bosses, but instead he winds up keeping his job and then some.This film is well-acted and is full of memorable characters. Ron Livingston does a good job as Peter. As good as he was, I think Gary Cole and Stephen Root had the best roles. I liked Cole's slimy mannerism as the boss and Root's crazy, stuttering personality. I also must give John C. McGinley and his love for Michael Bolton an honorable mention.Overall, this is a really funny satire that will be much appreciated by all those office workers. What happens in this film is what happens in most offices even still today, fourteen years after the theatrical release. The movie holds up very well despite some older technology.

The main cretin (Gary Cole) hovers over everyone at the firm and insists on written reports for virtually all aspects of their works. Yet, as Peter points out, the boss man is extremely dense since he, Peter, manages to come in late all the time without observation. Two close friends and colleagues of Peter's are terribly upset with management, too, especially when they bring in a consultant (John C. McGinley) to scrutinize the work force and recommend which underlings should be eliminated. On the home front, too, Peter is having trouble with his social-climbing girlfriend and she eventually gives him the boot. But, aha. Not to worry on this point, as Peter already has a crush on a pretty waitress, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) who works at the restaurant not far from the company's headquarters. Jennifer accepts Peter's advances and they are soon watching Kung Fu on the couch together. One day at work, however, Peter has had enough. He not only lets loose on the company's weaknesses to the consultant but he gets a brilliant idea to settle some scores with the management, on the sly. Can he pull it off? This is a very funny film about the trials and tribulations of the working stiff. As this film shows, many of those in middle management do very little, except pick on the true workers, and then wonder why everyone has a bad attitude. Livingston is terrific as the very bright employee who reaches a breaking point and decides to do something about it. Aniston is likewise good as the lady who loves the outside-the-box thinking of her man. The rest of the cast, although not well-known, is a total delight, especially the mumbling actor who receives the brunt of management's scorn. The usual amenities, costumes, sets, and such, are nice. But, hats off to the brilliant script and direction, indeed. The movie has many memorable, wacky, humorous and oft-quoted lines that you may have heard, without knowing the source.

34,atlasmb,Spot On Satire That Could Use More Character Development,6,10 July 2019,"When this film was first released, I went to see it with some friends. They all enjoyed it, but I found it unfunny. After some contemplation, I realized that it was about job conditions that were too similar to my own workplace, which made it not funny for me. After the intervening time, I am no longer in such a workplace and I am more receptive to its humor. That shows how relevant the humor is. It mirrors actual work conditions for many people.This parody, like some of the best ""Dilbert"" cartoons, captures the essence of many workplaces, and the absurdity of them.Ron Livingston plays Peter, the central victim of the office. He meets Joanna, played by Jennifer Aniston, a restaurant server who deals with her own workplace indignities. Naturally, management is the biggest target for this lampoon. But it also catalogues a long list of job elements that eat at the souls of workers everywhere, including cubicles, printers that routinely malfunction, traffic jams, and odd or disrespectful coworkers---many of the things that thwart good performances by good employees.Stephen Root effectively plays the part of Milton-a character the source material was named for-as a mumbling misfit who leads a life of quiet desperation, continually victimized.Unfortunately, the film plays like an extended comedy sketch. And its music feels incongruous and ill-suited to the subject matter. Although the film hits the nail on the head when it targets bad management and poor policies and procedures, it fails to adequately develop its main characters, leaving the viewer with a lot of satire.

The ensemble cast is terrific, portraying an amusing range of characters: Livingston and Herman as nerds, Cole as the slimy boss, Root as a mumbling misfit, McGinley and Willson as goofy efficiency experts, and Aniston as a waitress who lacks flair. Those who work in this sort of environment will surely get a few chuckles out of the situations satirized here. Unfortunately, the ending is somewhat of a letdown but there are enough moments of hilarity along the way to make it worth while.",Office Space
36,The-Sarkologist,"Seriously, work does suck",6,18 October 2013,"This is a cute little movie, at the beginning. Unfortunately half-way through it seems to change its direction, only to switch back to the original theme that it began with. The theme is actually clearly displayed on the video cover, and that is ""Work Sucks!"". Okay, I have never really worked that much (at least at the time when I originally wrote this), but I can relate to this movie because serious work that you do seriously does suck. I remember that I preferred to sort out items in the store room than to work on a computer.The main character in this movie is a computer programmer and so are his friends, Michael Bolton and the Arabian guy. He comes to work every day, fighting through peak hour traffic, to be tormented by eight different bosses, all of whom really don't listen to him and treat him like an automaton, and then he simply gives up and goes to the coffee shop for the rest of the morning. This is his typical day, with Friday having the boss call him in to do a lot of extra work over the weekend.This all changes when the hypnotist, during a work stress therapy session he is undertaking, dies while he is hypnotised. As such he simply lets everything go and realises that all the stress is not worth it. So the first thing he does is sleep in all Saturday with his boss ringing him 48 times to remind him that he should be in the office, and his girlfriend dumping him. Now that he is free he simply goes and does what he wants to do, and that involves asking the girl out at the coffee shop.This part of the movie is quite amusing because his attitude to work is that he no longer cares, so when he is being interviewed by the management reshuffling committee, he simply gives them the honest answer. He hates his job, doesn't do anything simply because he is not motivated nor is he challenged. The others try their best to impress him, and have indeed worked very hard to impress their bosses. In the end the relaxed guy is offered a management position while the others are sacked.From this point the movie seems to loose track as the three friends devise a scheme to support themselves by embezzling money from the company and then having it stuff up on them. The question that is asked here though is why, after all of the effort that they put into the company, are they simply let go? This is the meanlinglessness of employment. In the end, Michael and the Arab go back to working as computer programmers, while the relaxed guys realises that he is seriously wasting his life, and takes up manual labour.I guess that what is being asked here is whether we really appreciate the job that we are doing, or are we doing it simply to get ahead. Truthfully some will get ahead, but will it be fulfilling for them in the end? Depends really. Bolton goes back to a job that he hates, which ends up cycling back to the beginning, while the other guy throws it all away and takes a chance. He steps out of his endless cycle of boredom and finds a job that he quite enjoys.The final thing that I want to mention is the Milton character. I really didn't like they way he was created. Watching him, one is torn between feeling pity for him and detesting him. He is treated really badly by those around him, yet he also treats others badly, and whinges and whines. Even then, nobody seems to have the guts to really tell him the truth. He seems to want to draw attention to him, yet is too shy to effectively do it, while others treat him like crap, yet cannot bring themselves to truly tell him what they think. In fact he had been sacked a long time ago but nobody had the guts to tell him, and when the payroll glitch is fixed, he is sent all over the place because nobody really wants to be honest with him. Personally this is probably one of the worst characters I have ever seen created and this really dragged the movie down for me.",Office Space
37,slightlymad22,I don't know if I liked it or not,6,28 October 2014,"I'll admit from the off, that I am bias. I love Jennifer Aniston. With her gorgeous girl next door looks, great legs and what seem to be permanently erect nipples. I adore her, and will usually give anything she is in a chance.I never bothered to watch this as the poster was lame and the trailers and TV spots didn't inspire me to go see it either. Fifteen years later it was on TV last night, and in the absence of anything good to watch I gave it a go. Plot In A Paragraph: Peter Gibbons, a disgruntled programmer at Initech, spends his days ""staring at his desk"". His co-workers include Samir Nagheenanajar, who is annoyed by the fact that nobody can pronounce his last name correctly; Michael Bolton, who loathes having the same name as the famous singer and Milton Waddams, a meek, fixated collator. Milton had actually been laid off years earlier, though he was never informed and, due to a payroll computer glitch, continues to receive regular paychecks. All four are repeatedly mistreated by management, especially Initech's smarmy, callous vice president, Bill Lumbergh. The staff are then upset when three of the four are made redundant. They decide to get even by infecting Initech's accounting system with a computer virus designed to divert fractions of pennies into a bank account they control. ""The same thing they did in 'Superman 3'"".One of my problems was Ron Livingston as Peter, his behaviour would have seen him fired for destroying company property. I found him unlikeable and could not root for him at all. Jennifer Aniston looks great as per usual and Gary Cole is great as the sleazy Lumbergh, but it's Stephen Root that gets the biggest laughs as Milton Waddams.",Office Space

39,zkonedog,A Magnum Opus For Working Frustration,10,11 March 2017,"Some people are completely fulfilled in their job-related pursuits, are supported by their co- workers, and put all their heart into their work. Then, there are those for whom the exact opposite to all three of those statements. ""Office Space"" is for that latter group.For a basic plot summary, ""Office Space"" focuses primarily on Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a beaten-down cubicle drone who is just going through his life/job on autopilot. When a visit to a hypnotherapist goes horribly wrong, however, Peter snaps out of his funk & starts doing things on his own terms...with predictable hilarious results!Where this movie really succeeds is that it perfectly captures the essence of an un-fulfilling work environment. Most anyone who has ever held a job can relate, but those (like myself) who have lived a ""job from hell"" scenario will cringe all the more and laugh all the heartier.The auxiliary cast is also spectacular. Gary Cole as boss ""Bill Lumbergh"" has now become a classic performance, while such actors as Stephen Root (""Milton), Jennifer Aniston (""Joanna""), David Herman (""Michael Bolton""), & Ajay Naidu (""Samir"") turn in spot-on comedic gems.I consider this to be one of my favorite films of all-time for its ability to capture (through humor and satire, of course) the dysfunctional work environment. If you haven't ""lived it"", then perhaps this type of humor will not appeal to you. For the desk-jockeys, sales-clerks, and pencil-pushers of the world, however, be prepared to laugh long and hard!",Office Space
40,Floated2,Not horrible but not as good as it gets credit,4,19 October 2010,"Office Space seems like a very typical film. I really didn't find much humorous about the film. There were a few laughs in the beginning but nothing much. Also I didn't find the characters to be funny, especially Milton (whom critics and fans seemed to overly praise). His character wasn't funny to me, he was just randomly speaking in a stuttering tone and looked foolish. I didn't care for his character was he was rather annoying. The protagonist Peter wasn't all that great either. He complained far too much and was just boring. His friends Michael Bolton and Samir were also annoying and typical. I also didn't get Joanna and her significance to the story. It seemed very easy and odd how easy it was for Peter to get her.One thing about the movie is its humour, its very dull humour and the film was quite boring at times. It picked up on the parts when Peter told Michael and Amir that they were gonna get fired, so they try to commit crimes into the system by stealing the software and money. A few funny scenes were with the music, especially the scene with the friends smashing the printer outside while the song was slowly playing. That was pretty clever. But in general the film is basically just filled with stereotypes: the annoying voices over the cube walls, other people's music, the guy with the name no one can pronounce, the guy with the same name as someone famous (I never thought about it before, that does seem to happen a lot), and the executive who has no idea how to run the division.I also didn't buy the ending. It seemed like a cop-out and many questions were unanswered: who burned down the building, what happened to Milton (we last see him on the beach relaxing but not knowing how he got there), the relationship with Peter and Joanna, who did Lumbergh think burned the building and what happened with the money. The ending should have been better, like they should have possibly showed who burned down the building and why (Milton?), and it should have ended with Peter and Joanna on the beach relaxing, or at least together. Milton on the beach was dumb.Also the film really didn't seem much like a feature movie. It seemed more like a television episode, like maybe the Office (though it came out later). I don't have a strong dislike of Office Space. It's not a terrible film. But it's no fun at all. As for a rewatch (06/17/17'), Office Space remains quite entertaining but not nearly as funny as the praise it has received.",Office Space
41,digitalbeachbum,fun,8,20 June 2021,"Having worked in this industry for 32 years, I laughed all the way through the movie. There are so many stereotypes which are true in real life. I had bosses, secretaries and so much more just like these characters.It has a face pace script and it provides a light love interest. The visuals are brilliant. The casting excellent. Direction too.Thumbs up!",Office Space
42,funkyfry,reasonably good,6,26 December 2007,"""Office Space"" is an entertaining enough movie to watch, but not really anything especially memorable. The characters aren't all that interesting compared to, say, the somewhat similar ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" in which we're really given some information about the history and goals of the major characters. Mike Judge is most known for his animated shows like ""Beavis and Butthead"" and while his humor is effective it remains cartoonish and vague even when enacted by living human beings.Rori Livingston looks like a less buff Brendan Fraser and he's also slightly less funny. I never found Jennifer Aniston amusing and she doesn't do anything to add to her reputation in this movie. Basically he's the office guy and she's the service-industry gal, so there's something to appeal to everyone in this movie because everybody's worked at least one of these types of jobs. The rest of the supporting cast doesn't even have enough development to mention.The funniest scene for me was when the 3 co-workers destroyed the fax machine that had plagued them for years. There are actually a lot of scenes that remind me of things I've been through at various jobs. In fact just in the past month at my job my group has moved twice because our company is downsizing. I really thought the scenes with Livingston and the 2 ""consultants"" were hilarious. It's amazing how when placed in a ridiculous situation the truth can be the most shocking thing to speak.I definitely think this movie is over-rated by some fans, but that's the nature of something like this I suppose because it's going to be something that reaches out to a whole lot of people who might not connect to other subjects of comedy. The jokes come very quickly and the film is never boring, I just wanted there to be a bit more substance in the characters, and the insertion of an arbitrary and pointless romantic angle wasn't developed nearly well enough for my tastes. The film has very conventional and limited ambitions, but it's very successful at meeting its own goals and deadlines.",Office Space
43,Anonymous_Maxine,"As is sure to be the saying by now, anyone who has ever worked in an office should get a pretty good kick out of this one.",9,2 April 2001,"Every aggravating thing about working in an office, from the traffic on the way to work to that damn copier, is in this movie, and dealt with in ways that we've all wanted to, at some point or another. Well, except for the traffic, of course. The traffic  remains undefeated. Besides telling a highly amusing story about office workers who are just fed up with it all, Office Space is full of other little comments on society, such as the way the film points out the sheer goofiness of geeky white guys who listen to hardcore rap music. The film presents a heavily exaggerated version of the typical office, but underneath that exaggeration, the depiction is very accurate. You have the fairly timid but passive aggressive superior, Bill Lumbergh, portrayed hilariously by Gary Cole, the repressive office cubicles, the mumbly guy that kind of weirds everyone out, and of course, the disillusioned office employee who just doesn't care anymore.Ron Livingston fulfills this last role very well, being very open about his dislike of his job and his intentions to do as little as possible for as long as he still gets paid, but it is the weird guy that really gets laughs consistently, whose name, in this case, is Milton. This guy's hilarious situation involves having been laid off years before without knowing because no one told him, because he still receives a paycheck due to a glitch in the payroll system, and whose primary concerns seem to be the location of his cubicle, his red stapler, and the fact that last year, he didn't receive a piece of cake at the office party. The way that this guy's situation gets consistently worse and the way that he is pushed further and further toward the edge of sanity is one of the funniest things about this movie. And we can't forget the Indian guy, Samir, whose grammatically flawed exclamations also provide for an endless source of comedic entertainment.Jennifer Aniston plays a small role as Peter Gibbons' (Livingston) love interest, as well as that of a waitress who is also sick and tired of the ridiculousness of her job (such as a specified minimum of pieces of `flair' that employees must wear to work). Ron's home life is another thing that is parodied in this high quality comedy, as the shortcomings of living in an average apartment are clearly and side-splittingly portrayed. Clearly, the office scenes are by far the funniest of the film, and the eventual criminal plot to embezzle a huge sum of money from the company and take up a lifestyle of not really doing anything, despite the fact that it is also very well done, can be largely overlooked because of the sheer hilarity of the rest of the film. This is excellent stuff from the famous creator of the endlessly amusing Beavis & Butt-Head who, with Office Space, has further proved that he is just the type of guy who knows what's funny.",Office Space

At times, the plot events are not logically motivated, especially around the main character, and their pace and quality are uneven.As for actors, Stephen Root as Milton and Cary Cole as Lumbergh are the best, the others are nothing special.

Corporate techie Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is just having one of those days (""The Mondays,"" one character describes). He works for a condescending boss (Gary Cole), and the company is in its early stages of downsizing the workforce (with the two ""Bobs"" John C. McGinley and Paul Willson coming in as consultants). But Peter's life changes after he undergoes hypnotherapy, and he adopts a lackadaisical approach to his boring job. And soon, with two others (David Herman, whose character has the misfortune of sharing the name Michael Bolton, and Ajay Naidu as Samir), he hatches a scheme to swindle funds from the company into three private accounts over the next two years. At the end of the 20th century, it's easy to see why ""Office Space"" would become a cult classic: work sucks; it's that easy. As a satire of the American workplace, circa 1999, the boredom and tediousness is captured and played to ridiculous heights. Directed by Mike Judge, who adapted it to the screen from his own animated short ""Milton,"" ""Office Space"" is sure-fire comedy. The acting is OK, nothing really special, and Jennifer Aniston slides in as Peter's lovely girlfriend. Also look out for Diedrich Bader as Peter's beer-guzzling neighbor Lawrence (who Peter frequently talks to through the wall) and Stephen Root as the hapless, mumbling Milton.9/10",Office Space

Now don't get all fired up about my next statement- I think ""Office Space"" is one of the best comedies of all time. Kudos to Director Mike Judge for being far from a butthead and giving us this hilarious gem. The film is about the life of disgruntled employees in a computer software firm and their plan to seek revenge on those bureaucrat supervisors who we just love to hate. Star Ron Livingston, one of the guys from ""Swingers"", and the rest of the acting staff should get acting promotions for their work ( except for Jennifer Aniston who does not need a promotion) . The one performance I liked the best though was Gary Cole who played the typical supervisor in a very subtle but yet comical fashion.

50,slokes,Punchy But Patchy,5,30 April 2016,"A corporate comedy with lots of flair, ""Office Space"" makes me laugh but also strikes me as a missed opportunity.Disgruntled employee Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) has a daily case of the Mondays. ""Every single day of my life has been worse than the one before it,"" he tells an occupational therapist, who puts him under hypnosis and then dies from a massive coronary. Still in a trance, Gibbons takes charge of his life. His sudden burst of initiative proves beneficial at first, but he soon finds there are no pit stops on the Great American Rat Race.As sleeper comedies go, ""Office Space"" has lasted not only on its own merits, but as clear inspiration for the later ""Office"" TV series. Tonally, this film communicates the quiet desperation of late-20th century worklife with a gimlet eye: Static electricity that turns doorknobs into joy buzzers; cubicle claustrophobia, banners with meaningless slogans like ""Is This Good for the Company?""Where ""Office Space"" is less on point is with elements of story and character. The comic-strip quality of the script by director Mike Judge is apparent from the opening gag involving Gibbons' futile commute, and neither he nor his situation evolve into something involving. There's just a bunch of Dilbert-type gags that clonk you on the head with the futility of the basic situation.Gary Cole is the movie's lone standout from a performance standpoint. His supervisor character, Bill Lumbergh, is a masterpiece of mundane malevolence, sipping coffee as he duns poor Gibbons about those cover sheets on his TPS reports, or ordering sad-sack Milton (Stephen Root) to move into the office basement and spray pesticide on the cockroaches.As a character, there's a lot of potential in seeing his comeuppance, which you don't quite get. The film spins around for a while instead, following a pair of thin plot threads. One involves the only recognizable name in the cast, Jennifer Aniston as a frazzled waitress with whom Gibbons develops an under-developed relationship. The main crisis point for them comes when he learns of her past relationship with Lumbergh, which is another of those undeveloped opportunities.The other story bit, involving a computer fraud, hikes up the tension but is similarly brushed off by Judge rather than developed into anything deeper.There are funny moments sprinkled throughout the movie, and a lot of quotable lines: ""I have people skills!"" ""Why should I change? He's the one who sucks."" ""I did absolutely nothing and it was everything I thought it could be."" ""I wouldn't say I'm 'missing' work!""There's one enjoyably zen plot thread involving two efficiency experts, played by John C. McGinley and Paul Willson, who somehow see in Gibbons' new attitude a role model for the rest of the company. How they come to this conclusion I don't quite get, but their interactions with each other and Cole are consistently masterful.If you want a few good laughs about the workplace, at least as it existed back when cubicle walls and the Year 2000 virus were the biggest concerns, ""Office Space"" provides more than a few. It takes its shots and scores some points. If only it connected with something a little deeper then a drone's desire to achieve full catatonia.",Office Space

A Hall of Famer for midnight movies and rental junkie, this film overcomes its shortcomings with a wit and style that almost feels animated (kind of like Judge's other projects). Not only did Ron Livingston, Ajay Naidu and David Herman coexist nicely as a bunch of wage munching idiots, they also encompassed the harsh world of cubicle life like no other film. Sure, the plot was basically non-existent, but the whole idea of some slacker getting promoted for doing nothing is pretty funny. It just goes to show what our current world is like.

53,AudioFileZ,Best Lampooning Of Work Ever,8,16 April 2018,"Office Space is a comedy I come back to every year or so. It's hard to believe it's now almost 18-years (as of 2018) since it came out. It's still wickedly funny in spite of age. Probably because it deconstructs the banality and ridiculous nature of corporate low-level thankless employment it hits a sweet spot which still rings true. Ron Livingston is excellent as Peter who is most definitely in a rut at work and in life. He has excellent co-stars, and sympathetic co-workers, in David Herman as Michael Bolton and Ajay Naidu as Samir. They make a good team these three as they all hate their jobs at Initech. Initech is a generic large company with all the plenty of goofy employees which the movie exaggerates to perfection. In this group there's gold in boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) and disgrunted misfit (actually fired several years earlier unknown to him) Milton (Stephen Root). Jennifer Anniston is on board too as Peter's love interest and she makes the most of limited screen time. So, the cast is really well-suited for Mike Judge's lampooning of banal employment. The humor is laced through and through and it hits almost every time simply because it takes elements of truth we can all relate to and exponentially multiplies it to perfection. It never goes so far as to loose the grounding that everything it pokes fun at has a real world truth. I even get a kick out of how the stupidy of theme restaurants which gets thrown in! This movie has depth of layering as it connects the different pieces quite well. Something as simple as a copying machine malfunction becomes hilarious because we all can relate. This is a great comedy because it exposes the absurdity often found in reality, and does so brilliantly. I'm glad I watched it for who knows tenth time and I'm sure in a year or so I'll do it all over again. That's my highest recomendation.",Office Space
54,triple8,Absolutely and completely HILARIOUS!,9,6 June 2004,"Office Space is one of those movies I'd been hearing about for awhile and only just had a chance to see. I expected it to be good but was unprepared for how good it was.Anybody who has ever worked in a very corporate environment(and disliked it) will love this utterly hilarious movie about the day to day grind of corporate America. This movie is FUNNY. Not mildly so at all, it's fall down in your seat funny. I am very picky about my comedies and consider this to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Nearly every other comment is hysterical.The movie completely captures the essense of the repetition and SAMENESS that can exist hour to hour in corporate cubicle America. The script is funny, thought provoking and also sad. This movie gently yet methodically parodies every tiny hassle, every little miniscule detail that is encountered-certain things are exaggerated but there's a lot that's pretty accurate-the movie centers on a group of disillusioned corporate cubicle workers who hate everything about their job but are ""trapped"". Peter, the main character, a likable down to earth sort of guy, is particularly grim, he just can't relate and feels human beings were meant to do what they really want to do, not sit in tiny cubicles, doing the same repetitive thing every day. He reports to work every day but doesn't do much of anything when he gets there, just tries hard to look busy. Until one day, through rather bizar circumstances, he changes his whole outlook and decides he simply won't work anymore-mainly because he just doesn't feel like it.Office Space is one of those movies where it's a parody but still has a basic plot. The characters are just hilarious-all of them-and the best scenes take place in the office. There are so many funny lines I can't even remember them all. I think this movie can be enjoyed by all but the people who will enjoy it the most are the ones who have actually worked for a large company and sat in a cubicle and had their dark days where they'd rather be anywhere then where they are. People with no experience in an office environment may still find it funny but may not get some of the jokes as well.This is a great movie to watch when you just want to laugh. Or for anyone who's got OUT of an environment such as this, they will also appreciate it.SPOILERS: I'm not sure the movie needed to take the turn it did into heist land-it was funnier when sticking to the office-wouldn't it have been funny to have Peter promoted and promoted until they made him Vice President or something. I enjoyed the whole movie but still think the heist plot was unnecessary. From the opening of the movie and the impossible traffic jam, you'll be laughing your head off. 9 points out of 10.",Office Space
55,Galina_movie_fan,Cult movies are not always great,6,3 December 2006,"Since its release in 1999, Mike Judge's dedication to all slaves of their cubicles has become a cult movie with many devoted admirers. I believe the reason being - majority of us have to work and many are not very happy with their jobs or job environment. If asked, everyone may recall to having a boss from hell, to be annoyed by changing every week TES (Time Entering System), by the printer or copy machine that seem to hate you and break on you every time you need to print or copy something. Well, with all recognizable funny and sad details of the modern office environment that show Judge's observant eye and wicked sense of humor, the movie is not a great one and not always a good one. It is an average comedy that had interesting potentials but is too long for its length and loses its steam somewhere after first thirty minutes. It's got too many subplots and supporting characters that were neither interesting, nor necessary, for example, the romance between Peter and a local waitress (Jennifer Aniston). A moneymaking scheme that Peter and his friends devise belongs to the different movie and Peter's transformation in the end does not seem to be plausible. I was happy for Milton though. :)6.5/10",Office Space
56,nycritic,Clever Take On Office Life,8,2 August 2005,"Life in the office couldn't be portrayed more accurately in this wicked satire by Mike Judge. A sleeper cult movie, OFFICE SPACE doesn't have that much of a plot as an idea, where every possible cliché of the ""employee"" and the ""manager"" is brought to existence during the first half.The story revolves around Peter (Ron Livingston) who hates his job, and who has a nasty, micromanaging supervisor (Gary Cole, the physical embodiment of the manager/supervisor who we can't bear to see and would love to kill) who has a thing for using the exact template for the company's cover sheet, and Milton (Stephen Root), the office ""loser"" who can't stand up for himself to save his life and whose cubicle keeps getting moved all around the office building (while he endlessly mumbles about his office rights as compared to his co-workers' rights; his character is that blot people normally take for as the overworked wreck we feel compelled to kick into the gutter). Into this mix is Michael Bolton (not the singer, played by David Herman) and Samir (Ajay Naidu), both having last names frequently made out to be the brunt of co-workers' insensitive jokes and who later assist Peter in a plan to get rich quick and leave the work-force for good.OFFICE SPACE also revolves around a possible romance about to happen between Peter and Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress at his favorite restaurant who has her own share of problems, like being micromanaged by her own boss who wants from her the ""right kind of attitude"" which entails having her wear as much ""flair"" as her uniform may allow.As I said, this is not a plot-based story but a clever comedy that presents situations that arise from minimal events at work. Some of the funniest moments are when Peter finds out of a co-worker who by chance has gotten an early retirement -- but at the hefty price of being hit by a car and almost killed while driving to work after contemplating suicide. There is an element of ""cartoon"" behavior here; Mike Judge, responsible for BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD and KING OF THE HILL, seems to like to tell stories about ""types"" and their personality quirks and how they affect or irritate one another. As a matter of fact, this would have worked perfectly in an animated form, because everything about OFFICE SPACE calls for cartoon setting, but despite being a fully acted feature it holds its own as a slice of life among office employees in Anytown, USA.",Office Space
57,raulfaust,Office Skate,6,10 January 2012,"""Office Space"" begins pretty funny and entertaining in a strange way; I think it's the ironic kind of humor-- which I like. The first hour of the movie passes in a matter of minutes, since the story is very involving and we get to identify with the characters all the time. I thought people like Milton were only existed in the movies, but coincidentally, I met a guy exactly like him in a restaurant's queue. It's interesting to see that back in 1999, USA already had a special parking lot for handicapped people-- many countries of the world still don't have it. Also, it's interesting to notice how ugly were the white computers in that decade.. not to mention the old-fashioned style of 1998's Windows. Aside that, even thought the film has some funny and intelligent moments, it's never a big picture that inspires the spectator. I really don't understand it's high praising on internet..",Office Space
58,PredragReviews,"""Damn it feels good to be a gangsta...""",9,14 June 2016,"This film is quite simply genius. Not a lot happens; there's no big explosions, shoot outs, alien invasions. It's just a film about a guy (Ron Livingston on form) who gets bored of his mundane job, and decides to leave, ripping off the company in the process. The jokes are absolutely classic, and the characters are so unique and witty, yet dull and mundane that the contrasts just make this film classic. Jennifer Aniston, in a very early role film-wise, pops up as Livingston's girlfriend, and has a great seen flipping off her boss. The plot may not be the greatest, but that doesn't really matter and some of the scenes in this film will have you roaring with laughter. And if you work in an office, you'll relate to some of the gags more so.Ron Livingston is superb as the job hating lead and there are some unforgettable scenes particularly the willful, joyous destruction of the hated, random-error generating photocopier. His slightly mad neighbor 'Laurence' is also a great character: 'hey man! the breast examination program is on TV!' he shouts through the thin dividing wall of the condominium, as Ron is watching Kung-Fu with Jennifer Aniston. Watching ""Office Space"" seems especially therapeutic after dealing with craziness at work. This probably explains the film's broad appeal; it resonates with people who have needed to suffer bureaucratic B.S., the latest manifestations of ""office speak,"" and arbitrary rules at some point in their working lives. Although some people have criticized ""Office Space"" for not having enough ""funny stuff,"" they don't seem to understand the subtlety of Judge's humor, which leans towards the dry and sardonic. One could almost imagine Billy Wilder feeling at home with the plot, though he might have needed a little extra nudging to include the gangsta rap songs.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Office Space

60,bkrauser-81-311064,A Savage Comedy About Your Day-to-Day,9,27 October 2013,"Remember the midafternoons and evenings when there was nothing to do so instead of doing something productive with your time you sat back and watched the umpteenth presentation of Office Space (1999) on Comedy Central? Those were the days before The Office was imported from Britain and Mike Judge's other magnum opus, Idiocracy (2006) made its way into our hearts and heavy syndication. Yes indeed there was a time a while back when Office Space was virtually worshipped by office drones who sat chained to their desktops, alternating dead stares between the computer screen and a Dilbert panel.In case you have lived under a rock for fourteen years, here the gist of Office Space. Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), an unhappy computer jockey, is simply overwhelmed by the dreariness of his job. He sits in a cubical all day, is hassled by seven different bosses and suspects his girlfriend is cheating on him. He only solace are his equally unhappy coworkers Michael (David Herman) and Samir (Ajay Naidu) and the hopes of catching a glimpse of Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) the cute waitress at the local Applebee clone. Things however get complicated when he visits an occupational-hypno-therapist who calms his nerves a little too much for his own good.Since 1999 (the year Office Space was released), the economy has upended and soulless collating and secretarial labor seems like a distant memory. Many of us today aspire to get a job that would afford us a single room apartment for fifteen minutes of real, actual work. Still, Office Space remains to many, classic comedy cinema. A movie so clear and specific in its satire yet so universal.I discovered Office Space probably the same way you did; I heard things here and there and my curiosity led me to Blockbuster for a two-for-one rental. At the time I was too young to have a job yet I still understood the film's caustic, all-to-real satire. It reaffirmed what I imagined adulthood was like back then, a life of quiet desperation.As an adult who has worked a total of seven different jobs of varied responsibilities, I can tell you with a straight face that I have never worked in a place like Initech, yet there were aspects of Initech in all the places I have worked. I have worked in places where I had to slave away for a real chode of a boss, prepare reports for not well understood reasons and dealt with faulty tech. In that respect the troubles of our protagonist Peter are my troubles only in quick succession.But lets not forget the troubles of his coworkers. Both have last names that are meant to evoke laughter and both deal with their own little problems. Problems that ultimately culminate in a pink slip and an escorted exit from the premises. Also for note are other supporting cast members, especially Stephen Root in a scene stealing role as the squirrelly Milton.Director Mike Judge has such a keen sense of savage satire that its a crime he hasn't gotten the reigns for a large budget comedy. The best exposure he's gotten at your local Cineplex was in 1996 with Beavis and Butthead Do America. I guess one shouldn't complain too much given his straight to video success, the aforementioned Idiocracy.Office Space is a brilliant experience. It's smart, funny and brutally true to the day-to-day experiences we face. If you haven't seen it, grab your fifteen piece of flair and find it on Netflix. If you've seen it and you're not a fan, go home and kiss your Swingline.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Office Space
61,DJAkin,I can relate to this movie.,7,18 February 2002,"The main character in this movie personifies the way a cube worker lives. It's great!  I worked in a similar environment for two years and thought that a movie would be great.  Who knew that the Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge (of Albuquerque) would direct it!  The main character was also in SWINGERS and does a great job of transforming into a ""DON'T GIVE A HOOT"" worker.  At first he's serious about his job but then becomes influenced by a psychic to be nonchalant about his cube life.  Oh, how I wish I would have done that!  Also, the micro manager in this movie was perfect.  The way he talked was so annoying!  Yes, just like a MANAGER!  If you hate management and micro management work places, SEE THIS MOVIE.  It will allow you to either laugh are get MAD at yourself for continuing to work in the cube world!  I rate this movie a 7 thumb!

62,sme_no_densetsu,Work sucks.,8,1 March 2009,"""Office Space"" is a workplace comedy from Mike Judge, creator of ""Beavis & Butt-Head"" and co-creator of ""King of the Hill"". Here, a trio of frustrated office workers decide to rebel against their inept bosses when they become victims of corporate cost-cutting.The cast is well-assembled, though it doesn't contain any really big names, with the notable exception of Jennifer Aniston. Ron Livingston gives a pretty good performance as cubicle-bound everyman Peter Gibbons but I prefer his pals, played by David Herman & Ajay Naidu. The cast also sports some notable performances from character actors like Gary Cole, John C. McGinley, Diedrich Bader & Stephen Root.Judge's script is well-written and includes a number of memorable lines like the earnestly delivered ""Peter, watch out for your cornhole, bud"" and Milton's mumbling about the ratio of people to cake. Judge's direction is well-handled as well without being too stylized, excepting the slo-mo printer beatdown. The soundtrack is decent and helps to characterize these guys as wannabe gangsters.This is among my favorites comedies but I don't know if it has the same kind of cachet outside of the target audience of office workers. That being said, I think that it contains a brand of humour that should be palatable to a broader audience as well.",Office Space
63,KUAlum26,Mike Judge's rare foray into film-making is a true gem!,10,22 August 2005,"Judge,known primarily for his animation(""Beavis and Butthead"",""King of the Hill"",Daria""),does a completely bang-up job in his live-action directorial debut(?). The pains and frustrations(to put it diplomatically)of working a non-descript office job(here,the world of computer software engineering and distribution is used)are put into full view,looking into the moribund career life of one Peter Gibbons(Ron Livingston),who wonders what he would do with his life ""if(he)had $1 Million"". He hates his job,is whipped by his girlfriend and secretly pines after the Tschotske's waitress he sees everyday(Jennifer Aniston). After he's hypnotized by an occupational therapist(who dies before Peter is awoken),his persona and perspective is,ahem,loosened up.Brought forth from the animated shorts Judge created(And were used for some Saturday Night Live segments in the early '90s)that were actually centered on a mumbling,timid yet potentially dangerous office doormat named Milton(here played sharply by Stephen Root,also great in ""NewsRadio""),I think it is safe at this point to say that this film can be considered a cult classic. It may've not done very well in first release,but video and DVD rentals and sales have more than made up for it. Just about anyone who's worked in a job that has taxed their patience(among other things) should appreciate this movie.",Office Space

It's a very funny film. The best that Mike Judge has ever directed. And I have enjoyed all of his films. But there really isn't any denying that Office space is his funniest.I can relate to the main character. I wish I could do that sort of thing. There are also so many famous parts in the film. Such as when the main character and all of his friends destroy a crappy printer. Peter(played by Ron Livingston)hates his life and his job. One day he decides not to go to work. And he also considers not going back for the rest of his life. On his day off, he meets a waitress(played by the always lovable Jennifer Aniston)and they start to see each other.

65,ketgup83,Go for it ....,8,15 December 2010,"Office space was a surprise , rib-tickling comedy that will keep you entertained through out. The story takes place in a software company called INITECH and revolves around its employee. The film starts off well showing the frustration, anger of the employees. Patt is also one of them. He is completely frustrated from his job , his life. His boss keeps on reminding about his daily job but he seems to keep on forgetting them. Finally , he realizes after visiting a psychiatric that he has more potential and caliber. He decides to take revenge. The movie takes you by surprise. It is hilarious, fun and at the end gives you a moral message too. The direction was decent along with cinematography, dialogs. The catch here is the performance from the entire star cast. The best scene was when a telephone operator keeps on repeating the same message again nd again !!",Office Space

From the opening sequence when Peter is stuck in gridlock and the old man in crutches is moving faster than he is to Michael Bolton ( the very white guy ) rapping religiously to his gansta rap, the tone is set early on and it doesn't let up. If anyone has not seen this movie, I recommend that you do so immediately.  Give it a chance.  It will surprise you.  There are so many unexpected hilarious moments that you will be nothing less than entertained for the entirety of the film.  And how many movies can say that?",Office Space
67,mstomaso,Clever Little Comedy,9,14 November 2007,"It still boggles my mind that this classic working-person's comedy was overlooked at the box office. Unlike today's dumbed-down, unfunny comedy-schlock, Office Space's script was carefully written before the camera began shooting. Based on his Milton shorts, Mike Judge wrote and directed Office Space and did a great job. The film is cleverly written, nicely plotted and paced, and holds interest even after repeated viewings (something I can not say for most comedies).Peter (Ron Livingston) and his friends have a permanent case of 'the Mondays.' Stuck in dead end programming jobs in an uncaring corporate environment, with a series of ridiculous, annoying and dysfunctional co-workers, Peter has motivation problems. At the request of his equally aggravating girlfriend, he subjects himself to occupational therapy via hypnotism, but just as he reaches a deep trance state, the hypnotist drops dead, and Peter is left in a state of blissful lack of inhibitions. And as things begin to go wrong, they actually get better - through the films twisted (but oh so truthful) logic.Ron Livingston leads a nicely cast group of actors, including an early appearance by the now-famous Jennifer Aniston. Diedrich Bader is especially memorable for his heroic portrayal of Lawrence, the next-door neighbor and guru. And Ron Coleman and Stephen Root are wonderful.I have seen Office Space at least ten times, and it, remarkably, does not get old. The recent tendency to dumb-down comedic film exhibits contempt for its own audience. A return to comedies that don't punish people for thinking would make me a fan of the genre, and this would be a great example to draw from.",Office Space

If you've ever worked in any kind of office, this will speak directly to your soul!",Office Space
69,hall895,A fun time at the office,7,8 February 2006,"Taking the mundane and making it hilarious is not an easy task but Mike Judge manages to pull it off with Office Space. What could be more mundane than a bunch of guys who simply go to work every day in their nondescript, cubicle-filled hell? But there is comic gold to be mined here and Judge finds it. Inside this seemingly ordinary office are characters you can root for, characters you can root against and characters who just make you laugh. Anyone who has ever worked in an office will sympathize with the characters in this movie. Over and over again you'll find yourself saying, ""it's funny because it's true."" What sets Office Space apart from many lesser comedies is that the film is not just a series of loosely connected jokes and gags. There's an actual plot here, one that draws you in and makes you have genuine feelings for the characters. Ron Livingston plays the central role of Peter, the guy so fed up with his job and his life in general that he says every day is the worst day of his life. But then something happens which changes Peter's attitude and sets the movie in motion. He stops caring about what he's supposed to do and just does what he wants to do. Hilarity ensues. As Peter's situation takes a turn for the better, his two closest friends at the office see their outlook darken. David Herman as Michael Bolton (no, not THAT Michael Bolton) and Ajay Naidu as Samir do a great job of portraying the oppressed, beaten-down guys who do their job well and see no reward. It's easy to root for these guys as they seek revenge on their tormentors and their reactions as their plot unravels are priceless.In the critical role of the rather useless and incredibly annoying middle manager, Lumbergh, Gary Cole is terrific. The droning delivery of his lines is always good for a laugh and it easy to see why he is despised by those around the office who actually do the work while he wanders around drinking coffee. Stephen Root as the mumbling, disrespected Milton is a treat as well, perhaps the most memorable character of all. And yes, there is Jennifer Aniston too, playing the waitress who Peter is in love with even though he doesn't even know her. Her performance is fine, but she doesn't do anything any number of less famous actresses could have done. Really she's there just for the sole purpose of having a big name in the cast and doesn't really help or hurt the film in any way. While he might not have the big name it is really Ron Livingston's movie. He's the central character and everything that happens, except maybe for Milton who is off in his own little world, swirls around him. For the movie to work, Livingston's performance has to be spot-on and it is. With a terrific supporting cast around him and some inspired comic situations to work with the whole thing comes together rather nicely. It takes a little while to get going and in showing how mundane office life can be there are some unavoidable lulls here and there. It's not laugh-out-loud hilarious all the way through but once Office Space picks up some steam and really takes off it's a winner.",Office Space
70,sharky_55,Damn it feels good to be a gangsta...,6,4 August 2016,"Almost everyone has experienced the agony of the daily commute until it becomes pure mockery like Peter Gibbons' morning drive, slowly progressing inch by inch, 'racing' the old man on the sidewalk in a walker, taking the initiative to switch lanes only to find that it is the other lane that is advancing. Peter signs almost knowingly, defeated, accepting that this is the universe's will and how it is laughing at him. The company he works at, Initech, is a glorious mess. Two separate supervisors come with news of the same issue, highlighting how nobody really knows what their role is (later, in a scene of such piercing comedy and discomfort, a long time worker has trouble explaining exactly what he does for the company). They drone on with those same corporate sayings: ""Looks like somebody's got a case of the Mondays!"", in a tone that is much too cheery for Mondays. The colleagues are made up of colourful personalities that include a bright red parrot and what is basically a cave troll on a glitched payroll. The boss of the joint strolls by every other minute and checks the locks on the cubicles, and lengthens sentences with a dry, entirely too self-satisfied tone (the irony is that we never see him do any work either). But this is all okay, because Friday is Hawaiian shirt day and this will definitely provoke excitement and more importantly, a feeling of urgency and motivation to get those reports in. On a smaller level Judge also extends these critiques to the retail world, so that even the smallest restaurant is not immune from this corporate soul-sucking logic. Joanna must wear no less than 15 items of what is officially called 'flair', although this is perceived to be the minimum required in a thinly veiled threat. Forget getting in your TPS reports on time with the proper cover sheet; the restaurant managers berates with the self-importance of a high level executive. Buttons on uniforms are serious business, and you'd best heed this warning if you want to rise up the chain of command from lowly waitress. So the first half of Office Space has plenty of comedic and satirical potential, even more so now than at the turn of the century. Every character is a magnified caricature, every birthday cake and song plays like a death vigil. Beneath comedy there is always truth, which has led to responses to the film in the vein of ""I quit my because of this movie"" and the like, which is pretty much akin to saying you started a fight club because of Fight Club. The problem with this is that the film's events never come to a resolution, so unless you are content to fall into an equally monotonous blue collar job, that epiphany is pretty much useless. The gleeful irony set up here is that they constantly complain about their corporate prison existence yet they are also bound to for sustenance and material living. But that seemingly doesn't apply to Peter, who indulges himself in what is basically a power fantasy, where he strolls around the cubicles in flip flops, plays Tetris, openly flaunts his carelessness, and in return, is ... promoted. Perfectly humorous and in line with what we have expected from this crazy organisation, but the film can't have Peter becoming another one of those management drones, so it becomes a battle between the little guys and the establishment, and how they are taking back what is rightfully theirs. It's all a little smug, and when they eventually see the errors of their ways, too cookie-cutter to really have an impact.",Office Space
71,jhclues,"""Uh, Yeaaah, Peter...What's Happening?...""",9,4 March 2001,"There's something about a study of life in a `cubicle' to which just about everyone can relate; at least everyone who has ever had to get up every day, go to work and punch a time clock, then go home and wait to do it all over again the next day.  In `Office Space,' writer/director Mike Judge (the guy who gave us `Beavis and Butthead') captures the essence of the work-a-day world, in this case in an office setting, though it could be on any job anywhere, from the largest conglomerate to the smallest business concern; anywhere a `corporate structure' is in place and employed.  The subtle humor of Judge's vision is funny, and often downright hilarious, and all with very little exaggeration of the way things really are, from the weekly `motivational' talks from the boss, to staff meetings, corporate `mission statements' and the protocol of cover sheets and memos, all of which-- as portrayed here-- have a sterling ring of truth to them. 	The central character of Judge's story is a guy named Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a software analyst for `Initech,' who after working with a therapist finds himself in something of a transcendental state of mind, whereupon he divulges to a pair of consultants-- `efficiency experts' sent in to streamline the company's operation-- that he does only about `fifteen minutes of real work' a week, due to the very structure (or lack thereof) of the company itself.  And his refreshingly honest candor in outlining his job description soon has quite an unexpected effect on his life, as well as that of a couple of co-workers.  Judge perceptively expands the satire to encompass facets of Peter's life outside the office, as well, which gives the audience even more with which to identify, like driving to work in bumper to bumper freeway traffic that has slowed to a stop-- in Peter's lane-- while the cars in the next lane going flying by; and when he changes into THAT lane, IT comes to a standstill while the cars in the lane he just left start to whiz on by.  It's an application of Murphy's Law that -- while certainly nothing new-- works well within the context of this particular story, in which the humor is derived from emphasizing the annoying, mundane things that happen to us all on a daily basis.  Like getting in the shortest line at the supermarket and taking longer than anyone else to get checked out. 	Livingston gives a notable performance, giving Peter that sense of the `everyman' who'd like nothing better than to break free of the rigors of the 8 to 5 existence.  He brings an affable presence to the screen that perfectly communicates what Judge is attempting to say, and does it in such a way that it validates Peter's being selected as `Champion of the Cause' as it were.  Also turning in memorable performances are Stephen Root (a terrific character actor), as Milton, a guy whose very existence seems to be a study in suffering abuse and degradation; and Gary Cole, as Peter's boss, Bill Lumbergh, whose impudent, laconic methods of intimidation, delivered in such a droll manner, make him the boss everybody loves to hate. 	The supporting cast includes Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, the waitress with a minimum of `flare' who has trouble `expressing' herself, according to her boss; Ajay Naidu (Samir); David Herman (Michael Bolton); Richard Riehle (Tom); Joe Bays (Dom); John C. McGinley (Bob Slydell); Paul Wilson (Bob Porter) and Diedrich Bader (Lawrence).  Reminiscent of the world portrayed in the `Dilbert' comic strip, `Office Space' works because it effectively puts real people in real situations, and brings you into contact with some characters you're going to recognize; I guarantee that no matter what you do to live, thrive and survive, you've run into these people, worked for them, and alongside them.  It's a case of art reflecting reality, and to Judge's credit he's succeeded in making a funny movie that really hits close to home, without resorting to any gross or infantile humor to do it.  It's a film that simply puts the `corporate experience' in the spotlight and gives you a chance to laugh at `the boss,' and maybe even a little bit at yourself along the way.  I rate this one 8/10.",Office Space
72,rupie,"For all who have worked in cubicles, this flick's for you",8,1 September 2008,"As someone who is recently retired from cubicle life in the software business, I have to say this movie hits all the high points. Every nasty, annoying, nonsensical facet of life in the high tech world is lampooned here in a highly intelligent, perceptive and hilarious way, from the grating voice of the secretary answering the phone, to the endless memos on insignificant subjects, to the constant watching your back to see who gets laid off next. They even have the fashions right, as witness the matching tie and suspenders of the boss we all hate. I can see how viewers who have not lived this life might find the movie pointless, but for all of us who have been there, this is a must-see film. Particular mention must be given to the brilliant (I don't use that word often) script, which makes so many subtle points so effectively. I think this is going to go down as one of those ""sleeper"" classics.

And while Mike Judge is parodying this world, the movie works very well. The satire is dead on with the rush hour, mindless overlapping management more concerned with superficial appearance than quality, the consultants, and on and on. The only problem is that this is the stuff of an hour TV show, not a feature length movie. And then Judge interjects the romantic element, and the crime caper by disgruntled employees. Neither of these elements works very well, and from the movies mid-point when these plots kick-in, the movie starts to sink.It doesn't sink out of sight, but it certainly doesn't finish nearly as strongly as it starts.

Like most comedy sketches turned into movies, this one has some fine moments, but doesn't quite add up to a whole movie.Gary Cole's character, the ultra smarmy Bill Lumberg, is a deadly accurate spin on a type of corporate leader/weasel found in most organizations, not just businesses. His line for virtually everything: ""You know what? If you could just go ahead and do that for us, well, that'd be great...."" was painfully true to life. And there were many other brilliant characterizations of people, organizations, human nature, etc. Another example is the ""flair"" issue between Jennifer Aniston and her restaurant boss-- so funny, so true, and very enjoyable. But when the whole thing was over, there wasn't much of a story.

Livingston stars as Peter, a unmotivated software programmer who decides to rebel against his bosses. This film is hilarious throughout, I was laughing harder than I have in a while.

84,Movie-12,"Funnier than ""There's Something About Mary,"" ***1/2 out of ****",8,20 March 1999,"The hero in ""Office Space"" is a man named Peter Gibbons, who hates his life-especially his job. He lives in a small apartment. His spouse is cheating on him. His neighbor is a half drunken nobody who often runs over to update Peter on when there is something pornographic on television. ""Every day is the worst day of my life,"" Peter explains in one scene.He works at the INITECH corporation, and is a computer programmer for the Y2k problem. His co-workers and friends, Michael Bolton and Samir, have the same problems as he. The work office consists of a maze of dungeon-like cubicles, two efficiency experts who love to trim employees, eight bosses who always tell the employees when there is something wrong with their work, a vice president named Lumbergh who is like the devil himself to his workers, and the kind of atmosphere that made me laugh just hearing what goes on.The opening scene is one of the film's funniest. It consists of Peter stuck in a two lane morning traffic jam. There is a modern day romance involved with the film as well.The film is sharp, witty, outrageous, honest, and not afraid of showing the audience the truth about corporate America. The humor is varied in different situations. But for the most part, this material had me laughing up a storm. There are even more laughs in this movie than there were in last years hilarious ""There's Something About Mary,"" and that's hard to beat.The characters in the movie aren't exactly greatly developed. However, they don't need to be in this case. For they are enormously likable, all of them. I especially loved the annoying performance from Gary Cole as the nasty and evilly funny Boss Lumbergh. That character alone makes the movie worth seeing.The movie is directed by Mike Judge, the mastermind behind the vulgar ""King of the Hill"" and ""Beavis and Butthead."" In a way, his strange comic tradition seeps though to ""Office Space,"" his first live action movie. For instance, in ""Beavis and Butthead"" the characters have an offensive attitude against many elements. In this movie the main characters take a mis-functional copy machine, throw it outside the workplace, and bust it apart with baseball bats. See the similarities.Last weekend I previewed another comedy called ""Rushmore."" That movie did not make me laugh simply because there was not enough laugh inspiring material in the picture. ""Office Space,"" was exactly the opposite. What I am trying to get though here is that it takes a lot for a movie to make me laugh, and ""Office Space"" did it with ease.",Office Space

86,Bogmeister,Office worker fights back by sleeping in,7,22 July 2005,"Based on a comic-strip from Mike Judge, who gave us Beavis and Butt-head and King of the Hill, this live-action comedy nails some of the pointlessness and ludicrousness of being a white-collar office worker in modern America. The movie's best bits are actually in the first half-hour: the all-too-familiar stop-go traffic on the way to work; there's one hilarious piece when one of the main characters first appears (he looks like the wimpy younger brother of Bill Gates) and is revealed to be, despite his goofy appearance, a fan of rap music, even singing along the words; then he sees a street-seller black man walking towards his car and he quickly turns off the music and rolls up the window; and then there's the boss (played by Gary Cole), who never listens to anything the workers say, all the while nodding his head in a good-natured manner('Yeah, uh-huh..'), and is evidently trained to say the same things no matter what the situation (kind of reminded me of a manager I used to work with ..but never mind). His edict to re-read a company memo is a laugh-riot. Plot has to do with the main character getting really disillusioned with his life (and his work) until he is accidentally hypnotized to have a carefree attitude; he then sleeps in when he's supposed to be at work, ignores the boss, and 're-arranges' his work site. A couple of efficiency consultants see this as creativity and suggest him for promotion, while all his buddies are downsized. There's a lot here for real office personnel to relate to, including the stuff with computers (all of office work nowadays, of course, involves computers), although the 2nd half of the flic somehow doesn't match the first in the unerring accuracy of Judge's jabs at corporate America, slipping into unlikely plot twists without the irreverence which made the beginning so... profound. Aniston (from TV's ""Friends"") is good as a put-upon waitress, and John C.McGinley is very good as one of the consultants. I do agree that, sometimes, work in this environment can be a soul-sapping experience. This may be why this wasn't a box office success - it was too depressing for much of the potential audience.",Office Space

Even the annoying characters are done in such a way that's relatable - who hasn't encountered some of those asshole types?Some aspects of it were downright inspiring and satisfying. The whole thing was perfectly paced. I can imagine so many lines of this being quoted throughout time.It felt like it would be a comfort movie to many.

I thought it was hilarious!  I've seen this film more than 3 or 4 times now and each time I notice something new.  This film is for anyone that has ever worked in an office, worked with computers, or for people that can't stand their job.The cast in this film is absolutely perfect!  Ever since I saw ""Swingers"" I've been a huge fan of Ron Livingston, I don't know what it is about this guy, but I really like his style and his acting is quite good.  In this film, he plays a very laid back, relaxed, likeable guy.  Jennifer Aniston was a great treat in this film.  Her role wasn't very significant, but she did an excellent job nonetheless, and looks fantastic.  The other cast members were great as well.  Ajay Naidu, David Herman, Gary Cole, Diedrich Bader, and everyone else did a great job and played very interesting characters.  Stephen Root deserves a great deal of credit for playing Milton in this film.  Where his character is absolutely beyond obnoxious, he does a great job with the role.  It's hard to believe this is the same guy from ""News Radio"".If you have ever worked in an office like the one portrayed in the film, you'll probably find the film hilarious and will most definitely related to some of the situations in the film.

89,Horror-yo,One of the best I've seen,9,21 August 2018,"You may not be a huge fan of Mike Judge's per se, Beavis n Butthead and that sort of thing...I'm not one for example... but this one as a standalone 1h20min short comedy is surely a delight for people of many kinds of humoristic persuasions.You don't have to love the setting, the area or the particular comedy world or variety of this film to genuinely enjoy it. It's peculiar, but not completely self-indulgent ""get it or you don't"" type of a deal.If you've lived in anything remotely similar to corporate modern America (or Europe, or whatever) there's at least a handful of scenes that'll hit close to home in depicting the annoyance of the typical contemporary work space, its inhumane, mechanical nature, its one-dimensional spirit and customs, its repetitive thickness and the insanity-enducing aspect of being cubicle-bound surrounded by drones with their basic and sometimes lifeless personalities, and their depressing attempts at humor.The actual qualities of the film technically ? The plot holds up well, the characters are full and perfectly consistent, the main characters add value just as the secondary characters (Lumbergh, Lawrence the neighbor, Milton the ""squirrely lookin' fella""...), the script is clever and dynamic with some very good lines along the way, there isn't a single dull scene and the film runs in at a smooth pace and takes neither too much nor too little time to get its many points across, it's full to burst with content and cult classic calibre scenes that are both superb in concept and execution (just off the top of my head the virus installation scene, the printer scene, every scene with Lumbergh pushing Milton further and further away).One of the best things about this film is its compact format. It delivers the jokes, establishes its vibe and commentary, and the whole picture works as one giant crescendo with multiple character arcs and subplot tensions culminating together in symbiotic fashion.8.5/10.",Office Space
90,oOoBarracuda,Office Space,7,19 September 2016,"This film should come with a warning label for anyone that currently holds an office job. One might have a cathartic experience after watching this cult classic inspiring one to leave their job, which will unlikely be able to sustain their livelihood. The 1999 film, Office Space, directed by Mike Judge does that magic like only film can of bringing to life characters that everyone knows. Anyone in a working environment can relate to, or recognize someone on screen from their own life. Starring Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston in an exploration of how rarely one feels satisfied in their job, and what we can do to solve the cognitive dissonance of spending so much time at a place we hate, Office Space proves a valuable lesson to audiences everywhere. Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a low-level office worker responsible for rewriting minute details of code within computer algorithms to prepare for the 2000 switch. Spending his days adding two columns of numbers leaves him feeling unfulfilled in both his work and life. Peter is in a failing relationship, lives in a meager apartment, and sees no light at the end of the tunnel that has become his life. After a round of hypnotherapy, Peter reaches, for the first time in his life, a true state of ecstasy. Peter is able to remove the chains his job holds over him and create the satisfaction he has been longing for. Peter decides that his life should no longer revolve around work, and in divorcing that previous belief, he finds a fulfilling relationship with waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and has freed up more time for what he has always wanted to do in life, nothing. His changed attitude has been noticed by the upper-level management in his company who has recently been taxed with the responsibility of downsizing, as the millennium switch is nearing completion. What upper-level management has noticed about him is that he in unchallenged in his current role, and is a go-getter that is revolutionary in discovering ways his company can save time. While Peter is promoted within the company, and his two friends, the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) have both been laid off; Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) the ritualistic easy target continuously has his desk moved just for the fun of an overreaching micromanaging boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), and wannabe inventor Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle) attempts suicide because he is so disheartened with the constant worry of being laid off his employment holds over him. Peter's office is full of unhappiness and unfulfillment that spills over into each of the individual's lives outside of work. When Peter shares with his friends that they will be laid off, he develops an idea to implant a virus Michael knows about into the computer systems collecting rounded off cents accrued on interest and putting them into a separate account that the three could have access to. This plot will save the three of them from jobs they hate and allow them to do with their lives what they actually wish to do. After an error, they realizing that they are embezzling a lot more money than they intended to and are now faced with a seemingly certain prison sentence and are aided by Milton in a way no one could have foreseen.Working at an office job in which I spend much downtime, like Peter, and I feel like my soul is sucked out of me little by little on a daily basis, I can more than appreciate the film Office Space. Life is full of expectations and as children, we are encouraged to make as many expectations for our lives as we can. The irony of life, however, is that whatever expectations we set out for ourselves are rarely realized in actuality. The culture, especially in America, is that what you do for work defines who you are, yet, few people identify with the work that they do. Office Space is a prime example of the paradox of living a life that you want. The fact that everyone in the audience knows a Milton, or a Peter, or a Michael Bolten speaks volumes to the fact that what we wish out of our lives is rarely what we achieve. Breaking free from the chains of our working lives is an essential part of truly living. Hopefully, a little bit of the lesson of Peter's ecstasy is one that the audience can inject into their own lives, ceasing to exist solely based on what they do and taking more time for what one truly enjoyes, even if that means doing nothing.",Office Space
91,ruby_fff,"Light fare, dark coffee, and hearty laughter guaranteed",7,28 March 1999,"Especially so if you are, or have been, in an office cubical space work arrangement and everyday fare of such an environment is commonplace to you -- you will find yourself with, or rather, lost in ready laughter throughout viewing this movie. You can tell writer/director Mike Judge is enjoying himself doing this film.  It feels like live action characters of comic strip milieu all gathered in front of you on that big wide screen having a terrific time together, be it heroic or felony.The beauty of the script, or the genius of Mike Judge is that we, the audience, laughed out loud so easily at the poignant points demonstrated. Felt like a breeze (1 hr. 30 mins.) yet lots of little details were included. They are seemingly simple everyday life vignettes: caught in a traffic jam, reacting to office mates in the cubicles next to yours, at a coffee break with software engineer colleagues, being attached to/simply resents your office tools/equipment, dating, courting, maintaining a relationship, in a therapy session, having a neighbor over, having dreams/nightmares, dealing with your boss(es) and office politics, wanting to buck the system.  Go see this film without prior expectations, just sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie.Coming from one who's not viewed a single episode of the popular Beavis and Butt-head television series, I was pleasantly surprised at how well put together this film (with a title of two simple words ""Office Space"") is. Simply live cartoon characters in the flesh it is.  While Jennifer Aniston is in a lightweight support role, the central character is Ron Livingston being the handsome adorable nerd. Ron has a ""cartoon"" face perfect for this leading role! Following him around from beginning to end is a pleasure. Life is not perfect; people make mistakes; office space is the perfect setting to describe it all -- hell, you even might just get lucky, who knows. (I have a sense that people who work with computers, particularly programmers, would appreciate this film more intensely than regular moviegoers do.) The lesson to be learned could be contentment -- let's pause, we need not be caught up with all that's around us, life can be simple and, hm, genuinely happy.The supporting cast is indispensable -- every character has each his/her own delectable quirks. The music choices which included Perez Prado Cha-Cha and Mambo's, and contemporary RAP, did complement the events/plot of the movie. Bravo to 20th Century Fox for distributing this movie.  I will watch out for Mike Judge's next movie venture! I'll catch an episode on MTV and do catch up. Comic relief can be a healthy dose to living.Another movie about the goings-on in office spaces is ""Clockwatchers"" 1997, which has quite a different take and tone coming from the point of view of TEMPS. It's about four young women, with portrayals from Toni Collette, Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow and Alanna Ubach. Written by the Sprecher sisters, Jill and Karen, and directed by Jill. May not be for computer nerds, but it's another poignant look at life and living from Toni's central character. Parker Posey, of course, delivered another sharp performance.",Office Space

What makes this film interesting to watch is that the fact that if you ever work at a white collar job, avoid the following: 8 different bosses for screwing up on the job, sycophants(ass kissers) and consultants(managers that question your job)Peter also works with Michael Bolton(david herman of MadTV) and Samir(Ajay Nadiu) who hate the fact that working at a white collar job sucks.

Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead) brilliantly directs this sleeper hit of 1999 staring Ron Livingston (Swingers), Jennifer Aniston (Object of my Affection, Picture Perfect), and many others. When Peter Gibbons (Livingston) is overwhelmed by stress on the job, he seeks therapy and comes out with a life changing career philosophy: work sucks.  Eager to begin a new life of unemployment, a very funny lunch scene with Jennifer Aniston comes to mind, he decides to spend more time with his sexy girlfriend than at work.  When he does show up to work, it's only to play Tetris, destroy company property, and tell his boss where to stick those TPC reports. But instead of getting fired for his lack of work ethics, Peter's `straight-shooter' attitude lands him a promotion, and when he finds out about the lay-offs of two of his closest friends, he devises a plan to embezzle a large sum of money from his company. Everything I have mentioned are the ingredients for this very funny movie. There is scene after scene of very funny antics involving Peter and his boss, one being the scene where Peter is walking down a hallway, and his boss steps in front of him to talk with him.  Instead of stopping, Peter just sidesteps him, and keeps on going.  There is also a very funny scene with a copy machine that will have you laughing yourself out of your chair.

95,TheAll-SeeingI,Spot-On Portrayal of Corporate Workforce Suffering,10,22 January 2020,"The legendary ""Office Space"" runs the absurdity of cubicle life straight up the corporate flagpole. Few satires have proven as relatable to any subsection of society as this one has to the dehumanized workforce warrior, as it evokes the full futility of the daily grind with gleefully hilarious precision. This is now a highly influential comedy, too, having embedded itself in the DNA of films from ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004),"" to television descendent ""The Office (2005),"" to raunchy record label spoof ""Stadium Anthems (2018)"" in their depictions of their own inane employment environments.Inside the mundane Initech Corp., wage victims grind away. Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) hates his gig as much as he fears losing it, until an open-ended meeting with an ""occupational hypnotherapist"" frees his mind: Peter decides he isn't going to work much anymore. Yet after repeatedly coming in late (or not at all), two workforce consultants determine Peter is a ""straight shooter,"" and a guy who ""has upper management written all over him."" Outstanding.Since its 1999 release, office cubicle environments have largely given way to open-space layouts. But while the furniture has been rearranged, the truisms of ""Office Space"" remain in play. This is a sidesplitting comedy if there ever was one. - (Was this review of use to you?

96,jts0405,"I would like my stapler, you have my stapler",10,4 December 2005,Ron Livingston wasn't a big whoop. But seeing Stephen Root as Milton was good. This was almost as good as Beavis & Butt-Head. Mike Judge was hard to tell in there because he's only one character but you think he's almost 10 of them. Michael Bolton is a singer I have never heard of until I saw this movie just a minute ago. Stephen Root seems to always be funny. The man was nice but all he wanted was his stapler. Seeing Gary Cole half naked in Ron Livingston's dream was sick and I almost threw up. I finally came to conclusion that Mr. Flare who told Jennifer Aniston to were more flare was Mike Judge after all the characters I saw in it. You almost know he's in it because it's his movie. Office Space was awesome. All though I don't recommend being a bum. It was good to see them get a job in the end and not see them be bums. This movie was dumb but funny. Now I would like my stapler.,Office Space
97,diac228,A funny movie for those who ever felt like choking their boss,7,5 August 2005,"Before Mike Judge became well-known for his cartoons Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill, he had these animated cartoons about a strange and frustrated office worker by the name of Milton. In 1991, this cartoon called Office Space debuts on Comedy Central to wide acclaim. Years later, he decides to make a movie about this quirky animated short. Costing at over 10 million dollars, Mike Judge wrote and directed the low-budget flick. It became a box office disappointment, as it grossed only 10 million in the United States, debuting at #8 back in 1999, losing to the likes of Shakespeare In Love, Blast From the Past, and also My Favorite Martian. Despite the box-office failure, the movie gained a lot of popularity because of this huge cult following. In my opinion this movie deserves better, but it is not actually the greatest comedy of all time as suggested by some, but it certainly is one of the better work-related comedies in recent memory.Office Space is about a depressed and angry young man by the name of Peter Gibbons whose rage towards the company he works for suddenly reached a point in which he no longer cared about the company. After a fateful night with a shrink, he decides to not care what his bosses thought of him and no longer cared to do his work. Now usually this would lead to him being fired, but, in a bizarre turn of events, he gets promoted. He uses this promotion to get some money and with the help of a couple of his co-workers, he is going to try to steal some ""pennies"" from the company. Backed by a newfound sense about life and backed by a new girlfriend Peter is going to try to not have to work for another man ever again.The humor of Office Space is all work-related. Sure Judge tries some jokes during incidents outside of work but for the most part the payoff wasn't too great. All of the hysterical moments in this cult hit happen in the office. Whether it is the annoying memo, or the awful printer, or constantly being moved, Mike Judge wrote this script as if he had suffered for a very long time in the world of big business. Well-written and well-acted, the movie seldom suffers from boring moments or unnecessary moments, even though it is questionable whether or not the character of Joanna (played by Jennifer Aniston) is even needed in the movie. Nonetheless, the movie is funny, and the best moments are when the co-workers rebel, and also, when Milton appears in the movie. Milton is this very quiet, very frustrated man who constantly mutters that someday he is going to burn up the company as he is moved constantly and is not getting paid and is having trouble keeping his treasured red stapler. The stereotypes of office work are all there, except for maybe a few, but for the most part are all there.Bottom Line: Office Space is good, but not the best when it comes to office humor. If you want some really funny and outrageous office humor, try the comic strip and the short-lived cartoon Dilbert. Either way, you will get a kick out of this film, especially if you can relate to it. The acting was good, the writing as superb, and overall, it was a well-made film. My only grudges are the poor soundtrack and not enough usage of the film's funniest character, which is Milton. This movie is worthy of a rental whenever you can invite some co-workers over to your house. Just do not let the boss see this.Score: 7/10",Office Space

It is fine. But only that. The balance between hits and misses is exactly that, a balance. Some jokes emit laughter while equally as many emit cringe. It isn't a good movie by any means but it also isn't a bad movie. I don't think I've ever seen a movie I can legitimately call perfectly average apart from this. It is just average. I don't know what else I can say to sum it up.Let's start off positive. The story is good. I like it, and I like the fact that it is designed to be a satirical comment on office jobs. It's an interesting idea that was executed with mild effectiveness. It's a plain and simple story but I admire the simplicity to it. Purely character driven is a good thing and definitely made the movie feel more realistic and plausible. ​ I really love the ending. It is a consequence of a previous joke and it is so, so cathartic.Ron Livingtston was good in the movie as Peter Gibbons. Gary Cole was great as Bill Lumbergh. Yeah... he was a perfectly loathsome antagonist and did his job very well... M'Kay. Stepjem Root was great as Milton. I was disappointed in Anniston's performance and I just saw her as a run of the mill, generic love interest. She wasn't appealing or interesting. Aside from them four, the performances ranged from mediocre to poor.It is a competently shot and edited. It is very simplistic and I admire that in a way. It is very cathartic and requires little analysis. This peculiar style fits in with the more relaxed, laid back attitude of the film and it's lead.Mow for the humour. The MOST crucial aspect of a Comedy film, is its humour. And I must confess I was disappointed. Not to say there were no funny or clever jokes, there most certainly were and when it was both clever and witty, it succeeded exponentially. But the great jokes aren't that frequent. They come occasionally amidst a slog of poor, bland and generic humour. This was the key downfall of the film for me. I was not amused.As a whole, I do definitely admire the simplicity of everything about this movie and find it very cathartic and in line with the film's plot but it just didn't provide enough for me to truly enjoy it. I can VERY cautiously recommend this movie because it isn't awful; it just isn't that good either. I'll rate this film 5 'Staplers' out of 10 and a very mild recommendation because you may get more enjoyment out of it than I did.",Office Space
101,theshadow908,Funny movie with a funny message.,8,25 June 2006,"Office Space tells the story of a group of men who work at a dead end job in a bland company with eight droning bosses. One of the men in particular hates his job, and he finally snaps. After realizing that he hates his job and his monotone boss Bill Lumberg, he comes up with a plan to rip the company off. The plan doesn't go over too well, and he ends up expecting to go to prison, along with his friends. In between all this, twitchy employee Milton has many run ins with Lumberg. This is a funny movie with a great commentary on work life.I've never worked in an office, so I'm sure that some of the humour is lost on me, but I imagine that the humour is pretty realistic. Things that happen throughout the movie really reflect upon the way an office probably operates, like the scene where an employee makes a mistake, and he has almost all of his superiors come and point it out to him, or the scene where executives come in to do layoffs. The characters in this movie are all funny in their own way. Bill Lumberg's constant monotone droning never ceases to amuse. Milton, the mentally slow employee who was laid off five years ago but still shows up for work is the highlight of the film.The acting is really good. This started off as an animated short on Saturday Night Live, and the original characters were Milton and Lumberg, who are played to perfection here by Stephen Root and Gary Cole.Overall, this is a hilarious movie that reminds us all that work sucks, and you don't have to work in an office to know that.8/10",Office Space

He is able to deal with all of his problems very easily - even the one where he may have to go to jail!I've seen this movie 6 times and each time I see it it gets funnier. I will definitely continue to watch it whenever it shows. You should also see it again and again ... and may you never work in an ""Office Space""... because they *ARE* out there!I have to mention the cast individually because they all carry their characters so well that no one is a weak spot in this film!

Anyone seeing Office Space will get the connection.The film told the story of 3 bored friends working in onerous tech office jobs who hatched a clever and entirely plausible scheme to pilfer company money that would make them all rich so they would never have to work again.Office Space told this common-employee dream story in such a uniquely funny way, as it is so true that most of us would prefer to get a check from somewhere each week or two to live on and not have to work for it. Then we could sit and ""just do nothing"" as Peter(Ron Livingstone)wanted to do as a result of hating his crummy job. The film also starred the terrific Gary Cole (who for some unknown reason has never received the credit he deserves) as his coffee-cup-always-in-hand, very laid back, SoCal yuppie, Porche-owning boss in a do-nothing management ""position"" that we all know and hate too well from our own work experiences. He had some great lines(""why don't you just go ahead and...."". You just have to see it.) and was overall terrific, and especially in the sexy ""dream scene""...I was falling out of my seat laughing at the ""coffee cup"" ridiculousness of it all. The entire movie was so funny and well written in the ways it showed all the goofy work and neighbor characters most of us can relate to so well from our own life experiences.Jennifer Anniston showed why she was a big star in the making with her wonderfully cute and natural acting as Peter's girlfriend. The SoCal theme restaurant scenes she had with her kid-like boss about her uniform ""flair"" were priceless funny. And Peter's co-worker Milton, with his thick glasses that magnified his eyes tenfold, as the whacked-out office nutcase was funny enough to deserve his own movie, and was also similar to, of course in a Hollywood way, someone most of us have experienced somewhere in our many-office-job lives.And the consultants...what exempt office employee among us has not experienced the off-the-wall judgements and decision-making that the two ""Bobs"" showed in their hilarious scenes interviewing Initech employees? Mike Bolton??? You just have to see this scene to laugh yourself silly.I cannot recommend a film comedy higher than this topical and familiar workplace masterpiece that has become a very popular cult film in the way Harold and Maude did in the '70's, as it will continue to grow on you over the years and you will enjoy it more each time you see it as things you missed at first you will ""get"" later. I haven't seen anything nearly as good and funny in this genre since 9 to 5 from the early '80s'.Another sneaky cult comedy very much like Office Space in that it will grow on you and you will enjoy it more each time....The Castle, from Australia. One of the funniest films ever.",Office Space
106,mlraymond,Devastatingly accurate satire of any large office workplace,9,2 December 2006,"After seeing this movie for the first time, I told friends that it was such an accurate picture of the bank we used to work in ,that the movie could have been titled The --- Bank Story with complete accuracy. Just like in the movie, we had a couple guys come around to ask people what they did all day ,in order to get rid of them. We had the quietly controlling boss making people do stupid and unnecessary things, and trying to force the workers to have fun on the company's terms. There were two scenes that especially stood out. We see the dreary faces of the employees as Lumbergh the boss tells them that the next day will be Hawaiian Shirt Day, and that anyone who WANTS to, can wear a Hawaiian shirt that day for fun is encouraged to...then, we see the next day how all the office workers are wearing Hawaiian shirts, and have funereal expressions ,as the boss approvingly tells them how much fun they're having. This was simply one of the most painfully funny moments of total accuracy I have ever seen in any movie. The other was when the boss put up a large banner that proclaimed in big letters "" ask yourself ' what have I done for the company today?' "". I had to attend so many meaningless lectures and pep rallies about how great the company was, and how lucky we were to be working there, that that bit with the sign was yet another ruthlessly on target skewering of management attitudes. The best part was when the hero comes in to work late, stares at the banner for a moment, and then casually tears it down, as the boss tries unsuccessfully to make him feel guilty for not having a better attitude. To me, this was the funniest scene in the whole movie. For people who have never worked in an office, I can only say that this movie exaggerates slightly for humorous effect, but the core of the story situation is absolutely real. There was only the thinnest margin between the absurd management antics in this movie, and the nonsense I and my co-workers had to put up with in real life. This is one very funny movie.",Office Space

A lot of the jokes are funny because they are true and in some cases are kind of sad BECAUSE they are true.This is like watching a dilbert comic strip come to life. It is done in a great way, the story moves along quickly. The characters are developed just enough that you are invested and the pay off is great.Would recommend this one to anyone looking for a light hearted comedy.",Office Space
108,srdjan_veljkovic,"It starts great, then it's merely OK",7,18 May 2020,"First ~15 minutes are great. I was laughing for the most of it. Then it starts to slow down and by the middle of the movie, it's more concerned with it's contrived and silly plot than with laughs. It's too bad, because the lack of sense/meaning in these people's lives is kind of the point, yet this plot now artificially brings exactly that, thus mooting the point.Still, there are jokes and fun even in the second part, nothing special, but enough to carry through till the end. The end is a deus-ex machina, which isn't so bad in this kind of story, but, it kind of misses the point, like most of the second part of the movie.I'm guessing that this is the reason it didn't do so well initially, but, later, when people could watch it at their leisure and focus on the good parts, there's really good stuff in there. Hell, even Jennifer Aniston acts decently here and is _not_ ""doing the Rachel""! That's really something.So, there's a sense of lost opportunities that kind of makes you sad after the movie ends, but, it's well worth the watch.",Office Space
109,happyendingrocks,"Yeah, um, we're going to need you to make the whole movie funny next time, okay?",7,10 August 2009,"I recall many drunken evenings (hazily, mind you) where friends insisted I had to watch this film because it was ""the funniest thing ever"". There were even a few of these evenings where they eschewed telling me about it to simply put it on instead. Sitting down to experience anything with the pre-ordained promise that it's the best is a recipe for disaster. In the case of Office Space, which is assuredly NOT ""the funniest thing ever"" (I could offer at least a dozen films more worthy of this distinction off the top of my head, but I'll save that for when I get around to reviewing them), it's sort of a shame, because O-Space is actually a pretty nifty little flick, and at times, it could almost be considered hilarious. Without the slavish devotion its many fans have bestowed upon it, this film could stand quite well on its own. But the stigma of the cult classic status it has been unjustly awarded merely ensures that those seeing Office Space for the first time are bound to be let down, since it most definitely doesn't live up to the hype.Most of the truly funny bits happen in the first half-hour, and when the plot is set into motion, the film sort of coasts along and leaves the jokes in the dust. What begins as an extremely clever series of skits with the Seinfeld-ian ability to wring big laughs out of the most mundane and recognizable facets of our daily grinds morphs into a half-baked slacker larceny scheme and a space-filling romance that is so under-developed and ultimately pointless that it seems as if it was tacked on because women at the test screenings weren't impressed with the film.Granted, the funniest moments here are fantastic, especially the send-up of annoying chain restaurants with license plates and other meaningless ephemera on the walls, which is spot-on. But great comedies, and certainly ""the funniest thing ever"", should be expected to maintain their momentum throughout the entire film. In that respect, Office Space fails wholeheartedly.I'm not trying to tear this film to pieces, and I would still recommend it enthusiastically to anyone who's ever worked in an office, worked in a restaurant, or worked period. But, Office Space is simply not deserving of its status as one of the best comedies of all time, especially since all of the truly funny moments would barely fill a half-hour episode of The Office.It helps that the characters are all likable, even the ones that aren't, and that much of the satire rings true. However, since the film bases most of its humor on the alleged realities of the work day, the fantastical nature of the ill-advised plot sort of confuses the issue. This is the rare film that is actually hindered by having some sort of point, and Office Space would have worked much better, and been much funnier, as a series of vignettes, rather than as a silly office-drones-get-their-revenge tale.So, if someone tells you to see Office Space because it's ""the funniest thing ever"", I encourage you to never watch this film, as you will likely be severely disappointed. But if someone lets you know that ""Office Space is pretty funny and well worth watching if you have 90 minutes to kill, but if you never see it your life will still be complete"", that advice will offer you a much more objective and realistic set of parameters for potentially enjoying this movie.With that in mind, Office Space is pretty funny and well worth watching if you have 90 minutes to kill, but if you never see it your life will still be complete.",Office Space

The plot is where the majority of it's larger flaws come from. It makes sense about half the time and seems completely implausible. The screenplay though really saves the day making all the stuff you don't understand and the little bit of it you do hilarious. It also gives the characters some development and amazing dialogue. The acting is also very good, particularly that of Ron Livingston in the lead, and the others are pretty good too. The direction is also better than the average comedy. It is actually really good.

Based on the Milton cartoons, this is Office Space.Imagine working in an office cubicle with low pay, annoying greedy bosses, and virtually no respect for the rest of your insignificant life. That's what Peter Gibbons and his friends, employees at the software company Initech headed by the ever-annoying jerk of a boss Bill Lumbergh, are going through. However, an incident with an occupational hypno-therapist has given Peter a new outlook on life and he decides to take his friends, and his newfound love interest, on a quest to take out on the man! This is absolutely funny. All the protagonists are delightful to watch, each having their own unique problems, their own objects of hatred, and great ways of letting out their frustrations. All the jokes and insults in this movie practically work too and Bill Lumbergh is so annoying you can just beat the crap out of him (in a good way), which is why he is considered one of the greatest movie villains in cinematic history.This is a good movie so if you can go ahead and just watch this pretty soon, that would be great, okay?",Office Space

115,Christopher_Reid,A very hilarious and off-beat comedy,9,15 January 2015,"Several movies from the late nineties and 1999 in particular have strikingly similar themes. Maybe because of the impending new millennium, we were reassessing our place in the universe, reflecting on our progress so far as a species. Fight Club and The Matrix were in different ways nihilistic and anti-consumeristic. They were about the emptiness of regular life, the way technology had controlled and protected us too much. A central character breaks out of his confines and searches for something deeper and more satisfying. Office Space also has these themes. Peter (Ron Livingston) is trapped in an office with a job he hates. His mind is the prisoner. We see him (and several others) reach a breaking point.The comedic timing in this movie is exquisite. It captures every little moment of awkwardness and frustration in the lives of its characters. I find it makes me laugh just thinking about it. It's not just about office work. Everyone can relate to the kinds of annoying things that happen in Office Space: people that talk with fake smiles and rehearsed catch-phrases, horrendous and unlucky traffic, machines not working properly. You can feel the seething anger in the expressions of the characters. The tension builds. They can't go 5 minutes without something breaking or a disruption occurring.Their pain also goes unnoticed. They get stuck in conversations which they would give anything to escape while their tormentors continue to talk, completely oblivious to their disinterest. It's made up of mundane little things that accumulate relentlessly. It's ironic that the co-workers and bosses who are able to be so insidiously ""cheerful"" and organised seem dead inside while the suffering main characters who seem to actually feel things generally look barely awake or alive when they're at work.This is a highly quotable movie. It rarely misses a chance for a good joke or gag and they're executed really well without interrupting the movie's flow. Gangsta rap music is used effectively and hilariously. However, some of the later parts of the movie feel a bit more typical. Peter makes mistakes seemingly only to create a conflict for the movie to resolve. Mike Judge seems unsure as to what ending he wants. Perhaps the point is that Peter doesn't *know* what he wants. He doesn't even *want* things any more. Maybe he could gradually piece his life back together after getting a less life-sucking job.We fantasise about having powers like Neo in The Matrix and I'm sure we fantasise about having the freedom Peter gives himself in Office Space. To simply not care, to completely relax. To ignore our boss and do no work, pay no bills. The subtle joy and indifference in his face is something everyone dreams of achieving. You want to celebrate his victories and cheer at the screen, his actions feel completely vindicated. He is a modern-day hero of sorts. Simply imagining doing what he does could help a person get through another day of soul-destroying work.",Office Space
116,PCC0921,Bring me my stapler.,8,13 October 2020,"Everyone knows about this film. It is already a cult classic. It is a feel good comedy that is a commentary against capitalism, work and the corporate establishment. Peter (Ron Livingston), our main character has life figured out:Peter: ""So I was sitting in my cubicle today, and I realized, ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life"".The soundtrack helps also, especially ""Take this Job and Shove It"" at the end of the film. The scene where they destroy the copy machine in the middle of the field to music by the Geto Boys is still my favorite. I did not know this film was based on animated shorts called ""Milton"" that Mike Judge made long before this. Milton is the character expertly depicted by Steven Root. Gary Cole is also in the film. He nails the portrayal of how your typical, jerk, corporate boss should be. Treating everyone, like they are animals, while drinking coffee. Oh! And, Jennifer Aniston!

117,robsta23,"Okay Story, Some Humor => Not a Classic Comedy",6,4 September 2015,"I vaguely remember hearing from time to time by family and friends that Office Space is a comedy you have to see, and that it is generally considered a great comedy. Of course I had seen Office Space before my most recent viewing (yesterday) and there were some memorable parts. Watching it again on the big screen a few years later, I realized yes, there are memorable parts to this comedy, but to tell you the truth, this is actually kind of a boring story.This is the only film I have seen Ron Livingston in, as well as the actors who play his sort of friends at the office. It's sad when you are told there is a great comedy out there, but then you realize the only person you know in the movie (and still had a career afterwards) is Jennifer Aniston. However, Stephen Root steals the show as the ever-mumbling Milton. What a wacky awkward character that brings a grin to your face every time you see him. He is like an adorable whimpering puppy that you can't help but feel sorry for since he is clearly not a great people person. I'd imagine his character was what the movie was based on since the film was apparently derived from a comic titled ""Milton.""The famous printer-destroying scene: it really shouldn't be that famous at all. It's just three guys smashing a printer in slow motion. It holds no merit, and while it has rap playing in the background to reflect the character Michael Bolton's taste in music as well as the fact that the three are ""more hood"" now that they have ripped off their company, it's barely memorable.At least the film's protagonist, Peter, makes some progress in the film. He starts out by hating his job, and his life luckily gets easier after he visits a hypnotherapist who tells him to relax and then dies abruptly. After this, Peter lives life how he wants to, and despite his not going into work actually gets promoted due to his honesty and relaxed attitude. He then gradually starts becoming concerned with work life again, and by the conclusion he has found a balance between work and leisure.This so-called ""great comedy"" provides few laughs, but is really easy to follow which is probably why people like it. For me, I'd rewatch this film just for the parts with Stephen Root as Milton, but that's about it. If you're looking for intelligent humor - let alone a good laugh at all - don't look here. Barely a decent film.2.5/4.0",Office Space

What works in favor here is a bunch of funny characters that remain with you even after the movie has ended.Any normal person working in the closed office space, caged in his tiny cubicle, dealing with annoying co-workers and bearing his cocky bosses, will easily relate to the premise of Office Space. Lively performance of lead actor Ron Livingston supported by gorgeous Jennifer Aniston and other able supporting actors is good enough to keep you glued to the screen for its run-time. However, movie does not delve deeper or turn into a laugh riot given the huge potential and remains a good fun. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Office Space.

119,kyle-cruse,Terrible,4,28 August 2008,"""Office Space"" is one of the few movies that I truly cannot stand. While there might be a few good moments in the film, such as the traffic scene at the beginning where the old man is moving faster than the cars (which made the film look positive at the beginning), most of the film is just bland and stupid. The acting is a bit over-exaggerated and unreal, and the delivery of most of the jokes is just plain bad. The plot was truly not very admirable, and though we all know that work can be painful, we know that we need to just put up with it and be thankful for our jobs, not rob from the company that was kind enough to hire us. It's just not funny for me to watch innocent people get made fun of, such as Milton, a character who is made to look like an idiot though he is just angry about the way he is poorly treated. In short, a true waste of time. This is an unfunny film that lovers of fine comedy should avoid. Very little to enjoy.*1/2 out of ****",Office Space

I thought this movie was seriously funny and I enjoyed it very much. Jennifer Aniston played a pretty boring part considering her caliber of humor.

The use of the f-word is unnecessary in this film, especially by Michael Bolton (the character, not the singer). Still, the film is clever in satirizing the relationship between big business and their peon employees. This film reminds me of the ""Dilbert"" comic strip by Scott Adams. My advice is to read the comic strip instead of watching the film. It's a lot cleaner and it has the same kind of message. The DVD of ""Office Space"" didn't have any cool extras or anything like that. All it offered were scene and language selections. The language selections that were offered were English in surround sound or Dolby Digital sound or something to that effect. All in all, it's pretty mediocre.",Office Space

Everyone has a Milton where they work, as well as a Lumbergh for a boss.  This movie hit home on so many levels, you can't help but love it.  The characters are all great, especially Milton and Lumbergh.  The 3 main characters (Peter Gibbons, Michael Bolton LOL & Samir Nagheenanajar) were hilarious, they all brought something to the table that made the 3 of them gel so nicely.  I'm sure anyone else who has ever worked can relate on SOME level to this movie.  The 'printer beatdown' is the best scene in the film in my opinion...absolutely classic.  What a funny movie!

You wake up, eat some breakfast, get stuck in traffic, then go to work where you have to do the same thing everyday. The movie Office Space, the creation of Mike Judge, creator of ""Beavis and Butthead"" and ""King of the Hill,"" examines how wearing it is on some people to go through day after day after day of people telling them they didn't file the ""TPS Reports"" correctly or that the fax machine does not work. Ron Livingston plays Peter Gibbons, a fed up 20 something professional who is a computer programmer for some faceless software company. The Gibbons character one day finds himself in a rut, and wants to get out of it. He begins by not showing up to work, then when he does show up, telling a pair of consultants (John McGinley and Paul Wilson) of what he really thinks, even when it goes against the philosophy of the higher-ups. As Peter begins to change his outlook on his place in the world, his two friends Michael Bolton (not that Michael Bolton, instead a paranoid genius played by David Herma) and Samir (Ajay Naidu) begin to see it his way, for better or for worse. The character who steals the movie, however, is that of the big boss man, Bill Lumbergh, played by Gary Cole, who's pandering to his employees leads to the signature ""Yeeaahhhhhh,"" a sign of indifference to the plights of the common man. Little observations, especially those rooted in repetition, is what makes Office Space as funny as it is. The movie ends with an ultimately satisfying conclusion, though a direct result of a total cleansing of all issues leading up to the end, a bit of a cheat, but nothing that is unforgivable. The movie also features Jennifer Aniston and a frustrated waitress at a kitchy, TGIFridays-esquire restaurant where everyone needs to have sufficient ""cheer"" on their uniform, though no one really knows what that is. Office Space is an exercise in pointing out what is wrong with society and why nothing is ever done about it. A fun look at the dumbness that is the role of the common worker makes Office Space the cult classic it has become.",Office Space
125,SamPamBam,ALmost makes it...,5,30 September 2020,"I have watched this movie perhaps 4-5 times over the last 2-3 years, as its always good for a laugh or 3...the writing is quick and moves the story along well, the characters are fairly well developed, casting is not particularly terrible, and although production values are rather low budget, not a bad outing.
And then, on my last viewing recently, it occured to me why the last segment of the film was always a letdown, from the first time i watched it to the last.
It occured to me, that once the main character began to feel extreme remorse, the mood of the entire production changed so much, you began to look at yur watch and wish the thing would just end.
The first time I saw it I knew halfway thru exactly how this would end, but now it appears quite obvious the director and writers simply got lazy and took the easy way out.
Ron Livingston is actually pretty dang good, even in the hokey ending...and is completely believable in what he is asked to do. Likewise, Gary Cole hands in a gem of a performance; one wonders if it was so strong he would become typecast but he overcame that.
Stephen Root was perfect, absolutely perfect....classic and undeniably deep into the role of Milton.
But poor Jen. Oh man, she looked terrible. She still was a sit-com girl, hadn't really developed the chops for big screen comedy, but we could overlook that as she is a babe. BUT----whoever did her hair, make-up, and wardrobe made her look moon-faced and, well, OK, i cant say anything good so i will just shut my mouth",Office Space
126,Meredith-7,"Funny in parts, but doesn't sustain for 90 minutes",6,20 November 1999,"The beginning of Office Work is absolutely hilarious- if you have ever worked in an office you will be able to relate to every little thing. Unfortunately it cannot sustain the comic situations for the full 90 minutes. The first half hour is definitely the best, with some funny moments in the later part of the film. Jennifer Aniston seems wasted in her role as the girlfriend- but its nice to see her in a supporting role- that doesn't happen too often these days. Gary Cole is excellent as the head of the large corporation- every worked nightmare. Being a Mike Judge film there are moments where it seems to head for Beavis & Butthead territory- but it seems to just steer away, for it not to verge on the ridiculous. You may find it hard to keep your attention for the full 90 minutes, as it would probably have worked much better as a short film. However there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.",Office Space
127,Horrorible_Horror_Films,Great,9,16 March 2007,"Quite simply one of the finest movies ever put together. Of course when it comes to Mike Judge, I celebrate the man's entire catalog. I can't think of another movie that was so spot on with what it was trying to do. If you have ever had a job, of just about any kind, but especially of the cubicle variety you must see this film. Its perfect. All I know is I have a new respect and pity for people that work in cubicle jobs, personally I'd end up killing myself if I ever had to work in that environment, but instead of violence Mike Judge gives us the perfect way to deal with corporate culture in Office Space. Unless your a Lungburg type, go see this movie!",Office Space
128,len-21,7 on a scale of 10,7,6 February 2000,"This is an interesting movie from my perspective. I was fairly confident throughout that I would rate it a 6 until it was over. I then realized that I had enjoyed it - not greatly, mind you, but I had enjoyed it. Thus, I gave it a 7.This is one type of movie and one only - comedy. If it makes you laugh, it works. If it doesn't, it fails. This one actually had a reasonable number of good laughs and numerous chuckles. It wasn't outrageous like There's Something About Mary, but it had some nice moments.The characters were very distinct, very interesting and quite likeable (or hateable as they were supposed to be). The point is that they worked. I'm sure there were also some inside jokes for office workers in a big corporate environment - especially in IT departments.As the movie is 90 minutes, I was unable to criticize it for wearing out its welcome - something shoestring comedies quite often do.And, for what it is worth, Jennifer Aniston had a relatively small part - no more than the 4th or 5th most important. So, if you are seeing it for her, then save your time. If you want a pleasant 90 minute diversion, it's worth the watch.",Office Space
129,CrassActionHero,What is The Big Deal?,5,23 October 2006,"Ofiice Space (1999) The concept of Office Space is a good setting for a comedy. However, I was not amused as so many others. The main character is played by Ron Livingston is not very likable. Rather boring person to be the movie's hero. His neighbor Lawrence is likable and easy-going.As for the office, Not all of em are funny. The Micheal Bolton joke was funny then got old fast. I get it. Stephen Root's character I found to be useless and just annoying. I understand the cliché but still annoying. The highlight here however was Gary Cole as Lumbergh. Cole NAILED the role perfectly! Funny and effective. The job interviews had some mild humor and the interviewers seemed just like real people. That's normally how their attitude is. That is where the movie works.The movie soundtrack was lame. Did not fit the movie at all. It just felt very awkward. The casting was okay. The story.....blah. Although some humor here worked, the movie at times got boring. And the reason for a certain two people to start an argument here was so damn stupid. You will know what I'm talking about. They had to think of something I guess.The Last Word: Letdown. This is yet another over-hyped independent movie. This is okay but nothing special. Office Space is forgettable.

131,Jonathon_Natsis,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be inspired to update your resume.",8,24 May 2014,"Only a couple of years into the syndication of his two most famous projects, Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill, comedian Mike Judge tackled live-action laughs with Office Space, one of the most endearing and relevant comedies of the 1990s. We follow mindless office drone Peter (Ron Livingston), who gets by each day by doing the bare minimum at his tedious job while thinking up ways to patch things up with his estranged wife. When the couple's hypnotherapy session goes awry courtesy of the therapist dying of a heart attack, Peter is left in a state of eternal calm. Realising it's time to get one over on his insufferable boss, he recruits gangster rap loving white boy Michael (David Herman) and easily-angered foreigner Samir (Ajay Naidu) to teach the IniTech brass that greed isn't always good.The film hits the perfect note between comedic exaggeration and grounded reality, as things may start to feel a little too real for anyone stuck in the same dead-end job as Peter. Creeping around in the background of almost every scene are the tiny idiosyncrasies that make the typical workplace that little less bearable on an everyday basis. The rhythmic ringing of phones, monosyllabic conversations around the water cooler and endless amounts of menial tasks give Office Space a true sense of, well, space, and make our connections with its poor inhabitants all the easier.Most of the comedy may come from just how real everything feels, but don't underestimate the bit parts played along the way. Surrounding Peter's trio are a host of funny but fleshed-out side characters, including Peter's love interest Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), unfortunate office punching bag Milton (Stephen Root), world-weary and naturally cynical Tom (Richard Reihle) and passive-aggressive, scene-stealing boss Lumbergh (Gary Cole). Simply put, Office Space has something for everyone. And who knows, you might just hate your job a little less when it's over. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

It has so many little inserts that just crack you up Make sure you take a careful look at the bulletin boards in the office! You can tell the writers have really been there, most of the jokes are really targeted towards the cubicle culture.I'm only giving it 8 out of 10 because the jokes do fall flat here and there.

OK, I'm gonna get real, I'm 20 years old, I am still in college and haven't had any experience working in an office whatsoever. But Office Space is one of those movies where you say: ""Damn, that's as real as it gets."" Every single description of being an office worker and the story of these people who just hate their lives just feels accurate as hell. Office Space continues to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, but I do think the first half of the movie is clearly the strongest and it doesn't finish as strong. But it's just one of those movies I love to watch when I'm feeling down or just overwhelmed by life in general. The sequence where Peter simply stops caring is awesome.

This movie had me laughing throughout the whole movie.  Based on Mike Judge's short cartoons, ""Milton,"" who has a bit part, this is a view of the office work space.  Mike Judge did all of us a big favor by not making Milton the main character because he would get annoying for 1.5 hours.  He was even annoying for his few minutes, but they were extremely funny.  Judge also wrote the script and he deals with everything from consultants, to revenge in multiple ways to the retardness of having cubicle walls blocking windows.  This movie is played beautifully by people whom I have never seen before, with the exception of the people from ""MAD TV.""  I thought it was funny, off the wall and extremely good.

142,bernie-122,"I'm sorry, it wasn't really funny",3,5 July 2006,"The vast majority here seem to regard this as pretty much the funniest movie ever made. I read a lot of these before I actually saw it, and so I was prepared for perhaps needing gut surgery afterwards to repair the laughing damage.Well, this was never even remotely a danger. While I can see how people forced to work in office environments would relate to the various gags, and certainly the Office Dickhead, of which there is always at least one, was flawlessly portrayed, all I could muster from the experience was a ""Yeah, so what?"" And I have, indeed, worked in numerous office situations, so it isn't as if the gags went over my head.The story had potential, I thought, but in the end I think it was too ""dumbed down"" to have any credibility. As though the producers were careful not to make it too complicated for fear of losing some viewers. The ending must have been tacked on as an afterthought, because it just didn't make any sense. *POSSIBLE SPOILER* It was obvious to me that since the cheques got burnt up in the fire, that all Paul would have to have done is put a stop payment on them, and then the three conspirators could have pulled off the plan after all. But it was as though the fire erased all traces of the plot, so everybody could just carry on as if it never happened. This is ludicrous. There is no trouble at all to understand why this film was a flop at the box office. At least the movie-going public have redeemed themselves to this extent.An earlier reviewer said there was really two distinct films entwined in this production, one funny, one dark. He may be right, and it's probably the dark one that rubbed me the wrong way. When I think about it, I got the same sort of reaction to Beavis and Butthead, finding it to be somehow indefinably immoral. Likewise, I had trouble figuring out why people thought it was so funny.In all, I find it very disturbing that so many people found this film to be so hilarious, and completely missed the dark, immoral subplot.

Many people wonder what is so hilarious about Office Space? Well, the characters are believable, and many of you adults who have a busy work week will feel as though you are watching yourself.Office Space follows the life of a stressed out worker in an office building. The movie shows his stresses in a comic way, making you wish you will never have to work in the same conditions that he does. The movie also follows his relationships with his friends, his rowdy next door neighbor, and his girlfriend.There are some unique characters in this movie, also adding to the unique qualities of the film.

148,Don-102,"Work Does Suck and So Does This ""Comedy""...",4,23 September 1999,"Director-cartoonist-writer Mike Judge is obviously a talented and funny person. ""Beavis and ButtHead"" is a personal favorite of mine on TV and even the film version, while too long, hit the mark. OFFICE SPACE is what the title says: space. This movie is so lifeless and implausible you almost cannot believe what you are seeing. And how did they get Jennifer Aniston to do this muck? She must not have read the script. Judge should stick to voices and cartoons rather than making an alleged comedy about the 9 to 5 struggles of twentysomethings.There are so many ways this film could have been better. First off, an effective lead actor would have sufficed. Ron Livingston plays the ""hero"" of the non-working class with the energy of a turtle. I know he has the zap on him from the job, girl, etc... Couldn't a more genuine method of having him crack (like say a Jerry Maguire-esque wig-out) been even a bit funnier? What was with the hypnotist? Was Judge trying to mix ""drop-dead"", gross out humor together for us to sympathize with the dork's problem? The whole portion of the film where evaluations take place are ridiculously sour and the Livingston character's evaluation makes not a drop of sense, nor is it funny. We all know this would never happen, which is OK, but after he gets his evaluation, why does he leave and why do we care? We don't.The ""scam"" the three butt heads come up with is so dull and stupid, you wonder how they became employed in the first place. There are also ""Beavis and ButtHead"" caricatures sprinkled throughout. One character (played by Judge himself) is amazingly like B & B's hippie teacher in speech method and another is Principal McDICar all the way. What Judge should have done is made this flick and had Beavis and ButtHead sitting on the couch destroying its lameness.Aniston is here for window dressing only and must cringe at any mention of this so-called comedy. It seems as though some people are embracing OFFICE SPACE as their generational spokesmovie about the monotony of cubicles and bosses and annoying ""Miltons"" who work in every office across this country. I sure as hell am not. See FALLING DOWN, a drama about losing it over the job with Michael Douglas that is ten times funnier than OFFICE SPACE by accident. Even CLOCKWATCHERS, in essence the female version Judge may have drawn upon, has some reality in it. Material like this needs some reality, some real characters, and a lot more introverted observations about working the 9 to 5 grind. B & B are rolling in their graves.Rating: *",Office Space
149,Mr. Pulse,"So relatable, it's scary",8,23 September 2001,"Office Space is a small movie.  Not effects, no stars, no huge disgusting gags with bodily fluids.  It's quiet and unassuming, and it often feels as claustrophobic as the cubicles the characters inhabit.  It's a slight movie that feels like a throwaway on the first viewing, but carries more and more weight the more times I watch it.  Don't get me wrong; this is no classic, or anything worth analyzing, or preserving for all generations.  It is however, a rather therapeutic movie for peons like myself, and the more I work in worthless inane jobs, the more I enjoy watching the characters in this movie do the same.The plot sort of takes a backseat to the general mocking of the world of the modern office, but our hero is Peter Gibbons (played well as a convincing everyman loser by Ron Livingston); who, after a bizarre hypnosis mishap, no longer cares what happens at his terrible computer job at Initech Corporation.  He concorts a hilarious revenge scheme with his coworkers Samir and Michael Bolton (No, not THAT Michael Bolton), and tries to make sense of the bizarre world that features people like boss Bill Lumbergh and office oddity Milton.Writer director Mike Judge (Of ""Beavis and Butthead"" and ""King of the Hill"" fame) pokes fun at the Y2K virus (Remember when?), Internet company boom-to-bust, faceless chain restaurants, ""flair,"" office violence, and more.  He makes so many observations that, as I mentioned, the plot almost seems like an afterthought in this movie.  Other times I'd be more inclined to criticize as a result; but when a movie is THIS smart and witty, how can you complain too much?An extra special commendation to Gary Cole, utterly despicable as Lumbergh.

Here the rotten system of management is being ridiculed, showing its uselessness in an awesomely quirky manner. Each character is so relatable that you might even see the resemblance to your colleagues the day after watching.Interestingly, the plot reveals the thing that every over weary willing horse (not even from a cubicle) thinks but has no guts to do. Of course, I don't suggest repeating after the main heroes, but the general point is that we are being shown the forbidden fruit that is tempting everyone by its shiny, juicy flesh.I cannot even say that I am over the movie after seeing the credits, because for me it sticked for life. Within those 89 minutes it forms an attitude towards a better, less stressed life.

Now, there are cartoon aspects to the film -- Milton is a bit of a cartoon, one can imagine him as one in fact -- but this is clearly a live action movie. And, it is a funny one that also says a thing or two about office life and does so years before The Office.Ron Livingston plays his average schmuck who decides to say ""f"" it and do what he wants perfectly. The idea is a bit like Jack Black when he is hypnotized to only see the person within. The people who work at the office are also great, the hilarious nature thanks to how perfectly they play the roles. Consider his slimy boss. This is the guy who also played ""Mike Brady"" in the Brady Bunch Movie and a vice president on ""West Wing."" So, this was a great bit of acting. Also, Jennifer Aniston is great. It's a bit sad that her charm in such early works seems lacking now.I took off a couple points since the movie isn't perfect as a whole.

Out of all demographic groups, I would think that the geeky IMDb crowd would be able to appreciate this masterpiece.This movie has one of the most brilliant scripts ever written. There are tons of memorable lines (I'd put it up there with Monty Python and the Holy Grail). The cast is perfect, and the characters are lovable, protagonists and antagonists alike.If you haven't seen it, go buy the DVD. Then pass it around your workplace until all your co-workers have seen it.

I saw it 99, when it was a new release on video and I didn't think it was that funny. I saw it about a year later again, and found it hilarious. (Could have been that I was smoking really bad weed back in 99 and I was also 19 years old). This is one of the most re-watchable comedies I've ever seen, and I think that has to do with a combination of things. For one, it is brilliantly written. The dialogue is incredible. Also, all the actors give great and hilarious performances. The story is great, and the pacing and mood of the film is perfect. This is a ""must own"" movie, because you can watch it repeatedly and it never gets old. Mike Judge is a genius!",Office Space

159,tenthousandtattoos,"Interesting experience, not for everyone",6,11 July 2007,"The premise is simple and cool: Peter (Ron Livingstone from Band of Brothers and Swingers) is sick and tired of his boring office job. He's a software programmer, but that is second to the fact that is a BORING OFFICE JOB. Anyway, to humour his girlfriend into saving their doomed relationship he agrees to be hypotised in the name of therapy. Anyway, the therapist keels over from a heart attack before he can snap Peter out of it, so Peter remains in this very relaxed kind of trance, and decides that if he hates his job, he's just not gonna go anymore. He's not going to quit. He's not going to get fired. He's just gonna stop going. And that's where the fun begins, as the plot leads to Peter and his equally bored mates enacting revenge on the company they work for by plotting a dodgy accounting scam.Having worked a series of dead end office jobs for a series of equally dead end bosses, this film is like that old friend from the old workplace, and we get together occasionally to have a beer and b*tch about the bad old days. And while it's not a great script, it has flashes of insight that are pure brilliance, and will speak to anyone who has ever hated their job, their boss, whatever. I'm paraphrasing here, but, ""Human beings were not meant to sit in tiny cubicles staring at computer screens all day, listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements."" That's just one flash of insight among a heap scattered throughout the film, but I won't spoil them here. Seriously, if you are stuck in a boring office job see this flick, it can't hurt and it may well make you feel a little better...i guarantee the next time you call in ""sick"" you'll think of Peter, rolling over to turn the alarm off at 8am, stretching, yawning, and going right back to sleep.",Office Space

You may use at will any comedic devices, such as fish out of water, reversed premise, and other surprises, especially when dealing with areas of life so much contaminated with phony, official behavior and standardized language. Mix different types of characters and ways of thinking in the same scenes, and add several signature lines to make certain characters even more recognizable and annoying in the funny way.

162,ingemar-4,Near perfect comedy,9,22 December 2011,"Only a few things keep me from giving Office Space a top rating. Let's start with what I like:Great acting, ranging from good (Jennifer Aniston, David Herman and pretty much everybody else - there is hardly any bad acting, all act as if it was for real), great (Ron Livingston, Gary Cole, Joe Bays) to amazing (Stephen Root, Michael McShane). Only a few characters are annoying, and they are supposed to be (Greg Pitts, Todd Duffey).A story that is both funny and touching, by being close to reality, just with that exaggerated touch that turns it to comedy.Visually great, on the right scale.Essentially, this could have been a Dilbert story, except that some characters are even more deficient than in Dilbert, Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) in particular.So why not a perfect 10? Just one thing, really, the stupid discussion about Joannas past relationships. Who would discuss that i the first place? The following nightmare about his villain-boss having sex with her also felt lower than the otherwise high level of the movie. I didn't mind the question about his old girlfriend being unfaithful, it was subtle which made it funny, but these later parts felt crude and unfunny.But the rest of the movie was definitely something extra.",Office Space
163,Manthorpe,Unique comedy experience. HE-larious!,9,14 February 2004,"Easily one of my favorite comedies, and sort of a source of medicine for the pains of working in an office with complete idiots. Ahh, cubicle life. Anyone who's ever worked in a corporate office can relate to this film on some level, and can probably swear that they know someone exactly like one of the characters depicted here. Mike Judge really captures the aspect that makes office life so miserable, which is without a doubt the characters that you must deal with that your personal life would normally exclude. There is no question that he must've had his own bout with the way of the office bitch, as he shows that he knows it all too well. Out of the comedies I've seen, I can most identify with this one.Kudos to the casting department for putting together a unique group of people to portray the perfect characters for the story. Peter, Samir, Michael Bolton, and especially the Milton and Lumbergh characters, are all a true treat to watch and never get old upon reviewings.
A true comedic classic, but probably for more of a niche audience. Having never worked in an office before, you may not enjoy it as much as others...but then again, I could be wrong and is still worth checking out. But if you have or do work in an office, this movie is a must see!Office Space has a special place in my heart for others reasons too. Parts of it were filmed within walking distance of my apartment, and my girlfriend lives in Peter's apartments from the movie, which is also right down the street! That just adds even more to the fact that I can identify with this film 100%, especially considering I drive the same way to work as Peter did! Too weird.Um, yeah, go see it.",Office Space
164,lizziebeth-1,Just isn't able to satisfy-I'm sorry. 6/10. Spoilers.,6,21 October 2002,"For a long time I didn't think I could do Office Space justice, but perhaps I can contribute after all. Let me begin with my conclusion: this little indie is under-developed.It's not often that I say that. I've previously accused Legally Blonde of being over-developed (too many larger-than-life plot devices, and the heroine herself was over-polished), Mystery Men of being too dumbed down, Men In Black2 of completely failing to be a movie of any sort, and The Scarlet Pimpernel of rushing its last 1/3, or whatever. But curiously, Office Space to me is one of those movies that has a good concept, which it executes with occasional bursts of `flair' (sorry about the in-joke), but on the whole leaves you with the impression that it's missing a hell of a lot of its own intentions. As if the writer never really understood his subject. Or the movie is preternaturally unfinished. Except that there is an obvious plot-resolution, with even a hint of future exaggeration of a learned response (one last joke). So what's wrong? Well, maybe there never was enough story. Or too much mileage was made (whipped up) and spread too thinly over a very small-scale story. Is Office Space not economical enough?No! It was that we never got to spend enough time with any one character; not even Peter, the lead (Ron Livingston). His `anorexic' girlfriend who's supposed to have been cheating on him we miss completely in the psychologist's office, because there is no communication between them, no link whatsoever. Peter is disconnected. Jennifer Aniston is also disconnected from him, in her typical NY Friends way, and frankly gives a completely empty performance as Joanna. As a person (forget any rep she might carry), would you want her as your girlfriend?Obviously, some of the disconnectedness is by design; perhaps all of it, but it leaves you with this sense of dissatisfaction, that something sizeable is missing.Production values are OK, if a little too sparing. At least enough money was spent on a cute soundtrack.The other thing that bothers me is the corrosively empty and pathetic depiction of office people. I work in an office, and people ALWAYS perk up a lousy system, it's never that bad. Remember Working Girl (1988), when the secretaries livened up the place with their chatter and desk toys, but swooped to their word processors when the boss was on her way in? Now THAT's an office. Here, there just isn't enough base-level humanity in any character for me to empathise enough with anyone.Well, perhaps with the exception of Peter's friends, Michael Bolton (David Herman), Samir Nainenajad (Ajay Naidu), and even Steve the door-to-door subscription salesman (Orlando Jones), whom I like very much. We instantly knew by his broad stereotypical intonation that he was fibbing, and it's a guilty pleasure to discover that he's sort of a colleague, hahahaha. One criticism though: nobody who IS a programmer calls themselves a `software engineer'. Only corporate bosses who don't know what it means call it that. That really rankled with me in the movie, because I used to be a programmer too. We liked to be called by our function names on the system, like `Hey, I just became root!' or something. Never `software engineer'. OK, OK, `apps programmer' if you REALLY must, but even that's just for plebs.I like these guys; but Peter isn't ANYTHING like a programmer (programmers love intensity, Monty Python, and juggling). Perhaps Peter's job should've been different. He can't even explain the Y2K problem to a waitress! Of course, Peter had to actually pull off what most of us only wish we could, so his sympathy for us was always doomed. Unless the writer could pull Peter's fat out of the fire with a satisfying ending of some kind. Do I buy Peter's happiness as a labourer? Forever? No.Don't get me wrong, I think Ron Livingston is the perfect embodiment of Peter, who had to be a slacker. I just can't connect to the character much. I understand his lackadaisical misery; it's PERFECTLY captured by Livingston's ambling walk (which is his real walk, btw; it's probably what got him cast as the lead!). In fact, my 'secret' favourite scene in this one is where Peter avoids and ambles around his boss, Lumbergh (Gary Cole), completely ignoring the rambling man.A similar story of office woe was released a year earlier, Clockwatchers (1998), with Alanna Ubach and Parker Posey. Now THAT flick was so STRIPPED of all humanity that it became completely unwatchable. Office Space at least explores similar issues with some humour, even if it's a bit stilted....That's it; there is no real JOY here! D'oh. But I still think we should've been allowed more glimpses. The only visible happiness occurs during the bickering scenes amongst the programmers in Peter's loungeroom and in the car, and the final 'getting wicked' scene in front of the sound system [ ah, Ron, why is it that neither of you boys can dance? You wrestle! ]. Oh, and of course the opening sequence!Of course, the soundtrack is the best thing about the movie. For me. It lifts our mood using the UNFORGETTABLY UNIQUE  Peres Prez Prado (with his melodic grunts). Of the 2 Prez Prado tracks,  Mambo No 8 is included in its entirety during the opening sequence!  I must congratulate Judge on this canny choice to hint at the plot's quirkiness and playfulness, and for intercutting it with hard rap song No Tears, supposedly getting played by the Michael Bolton character, who's also driving to work. We instantly love him as the `whitebread' computer nerd who's a dead ringer for a young Bill Gates, but who raps along pretty competently to heavy tunes.
The final terrific song that leads us out over the end credits is the particularly apt `Shove This  J-O-B! (Take This Job and Shove It)', by Canimus & Biz Markic. Perfect use of the perfect song. Thanks, man.",Office Space

The danger is always that a comedy about boredom can be, well, boring, and it is so for the first third of the film.Ron Livingston turns in a good performance as Peter Gibbons. The office situations and characters are recognisably authentic but where's the humour or interest in that? I thought it might get more interesting after Peter got hypnotised, and it did. If you can get to this point, the film livens up, and speeds up.Jennifer Aniston eventually appears (as Joanna) and plays her part well.

Whether it's the printer that always jams, passive aggressive managers, too many mangers, computers that are slow when your time constrained.....I'd add one of the more underrated scenes in the movie is Peter trying to sleep while having nightmares about his job. All the while looking every bit the part of a zombie eaten away by his job. I've related to that as well at times in my life. Great acting there by Ron Livingston.

My health and sanity were deteriorating and then I found 'Office Space'. This is a comedy, but when the protagonist becomes a shoulder-shrugging, half-awake non-worrier after a hypnosis mishap - and, better skill, becomes more valued, even promoted, at work than his anxious, worried colleagues - everything about office life jarred into place.

While the story line is nothing spectacular, the dialog and acting keep this movie moving at a brisk pace.  Ron Livingston, who was excellent in a supporting role in Swingers, plays an everyman who hates his life, job, and girlfriend but has no idea what to do about it.  The supporting cast of co-workers are greatness representing just about every office sub-culture perfectly albeit to extremes.  Jennifer Aniston completes the male fantasy aspect of having your cake and being able to eat it as well as serving as a conscience for the protagonist.  Several scenes will have you rolling in the aisles.  The Boyz in the Hood kill the copier scene is the funniest I have seen in a while.",Office Space
170,Supachewy,"A Great Film If You Work At An Office, Not Really If You Don't",6,22 September 2010,"The cult comedy Office Space is directed by Mike Judge and stars Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston. The film takes place in a modern day office building for the most part.The film starts with three office workers driving to work Peter (Livingston), Michael, and Samir. When the three arrive at work they go about their normal terrible day. Peter sits at a desk and constantly listens to a woman with an annoying voice telling people on the phone to hold. Also, when he makes a mistake on a cover page for a report eight different people tell him how he made a mistake and to check his memo. He hates his boss, Bill Lumbergh, more than anyone in the world and basically hates his life overall. When his girlfriend asks him to go see a hypnotherapist to help with their relationship he goes and becomes hypnotized. But before the hypnotist can snap him out of the hypnosis he suffers from some sort of physical attack and has to go to the hospital. Peter now has a completely different view on life and goes to live it the way he wants to...The screenplay was very clever and smart, but it was aimed for a specific audience. That audience is people who work at an office building and I am not one of those people so I do not enjoy it as much as those who do work at an office building. Besides that fact though there were many interesting characters and some great comedic bits in this film. One that was great was when at the beginning Michael is listening to rap music and a black man starts walking by he lowers the volume and puts up his windows so the man couldn't hear the music. There was a lot of really great dialogue in this film as well like basically all the lines of Bill Lumbergh and Milton Waddams. I believe that the final act of the film was very weak though and the ending is as well weak and not very clear. A smart screenplay but again it is too much for a specific audience.The direction for this film by Mike Judge was very good. He got decent performances from his actors, nothing special or really that memorable. But he made up for it with some iconic scenes. The one I most remember is Peter, Michael, and Samir destroying the copy machine with a baseball bat. That is something that I will always will think of when thinking of this film. The film was simply made and it really worked for it.As I said in the last paragraph the acting was not very strong. Basically the whole cast except for I would say Gary Cole and Stephen Root give mediocre performances that are not very memorable. Cole and Root though were hilarious in their roles spitting out brilliant dialogue like they wrote it themselves. The two of them are the only reasons this film is called a cult classic.Overall I give this film a 6/10.

Not everyone can sit in a cubicle for 8 hours (I could, depending on the type of work) but everyone who has had this type of job will definitely relate.

The movie phrases are fun to quote (the sign of a sure classic) and the characters offered amusing diversity to capture much of the personalities one would find while working in a large office.

The audience roared in laughter, and myself and my date had a blast. I vowed to buy it when it came out on VHS. I did. Years later I got a DVD copy for my birthday--too bad there are no bonus features on it---Mike Judge are you listening? re-issue! The story resolves around a group of keyboard jockeys working on banal recoding for the century turnover crisis (that never occurred. But remember the panic?) in 1999. The lead character Peter, played by Ron Livingston, has completely lost all will to do a good job at work. His life has leveled out. He stays with both his girlfriend and his job, only out of habit. He realizes that he needs to turn his life around when his company makes him work over the weekend because they laid off staff for cost saving measures. Before the weekend arrives, he and his girlfriend visit a shrink who, in the middle of hypnotizing Peter, dies. The story now starts and asks the question ""If you don't care what happens, what is the worst that can happen?"" If you work for his company only good can happen.

182,zevt,Half great,7,25 January 2009,"For the first half, this is some of the best comedy on cubicle-hell and office annoyances this side of Dilbert. Little observed details make for great comedy that anyone who worked in an office could relate to, like elusive moving lanes at a traffic jam, and annoying cubicle neighbours. The consultant 'efficiency experts' and how they terrify and inspect employees is classic Dilbert material.Although these are more a series of hilarious vignettes than a plot, they work superbly as a setup and the actors are all very well chosen and superbly acted, especially Stephen Root as a mumbling, downtrodden victim of office hell, and the passive-aggressive VP.Then the plot kicks in. There's a romantic plot line that neither adds nor detracts and just sits there. There's the hypnotherapy that converts the protagonist into an ultimately laid-back Bartleby, which is funny at first, but then loses touch with reality as the consultants admire him and the boss tolerates him for no reason other than to keep the plot developing.Then it turns inexplicably into a completely useless revenge-crime-caper which does worse than bore us: It makes us lose our connection with the protagonists. Even the character of Milton is taken into unrealistic territory with basements and cockroaches.The movie should have stuck with realistic office humor instead of trying to be a movie. A piffling plot, say, about the downsizing effects on the company could have been infinitely funnier than this.In summary: A superb first half, then it all falls apart. And the rap soundtrack is terrible.",Office Space

184,schmimic,One of the most classically hilarious looks at cubicle culture.,9,24 May 2005,"Starring: Ron Livingston, Jennifer Anniston, Stephen Root, Diedrich Bader, Mike Judge Have you ever worked an office job? Did it drive you crazy? The humming of the fluorescent lighting, the confined cubicles, all the bosses who drone on about mission statements, bosses who approach you in a passive aggressive manner when they need something or want to inform you of your mistakes? If any of that sounds familiar, then you should probably see Office Space. This movie comes from the mind of the man who created Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill (Mike Judge), but with a different approach to humour than the above mentioned television shows. Office Space is a satire on office culture, a look at how things often are, or at least how they feel, and a glimpse into how we all wish they could be.Peter Gibbons (Livingston) has been a dutiful employee for Initech for God only knows how many years. You can tell right from the beginning that he hates his job, from his hesitation to walk through the doors into the building to the frustrated looks he has when his bosses tell him about the proper way to prepare TPS reports. He's hated his job for years, and his girlfriend convinces him to go to an occupational hypnotherapy's. The hypnotherapy's puts Peter into a trance, gets him into a relaxed state of mind, and tells Peter that when he counts to three, he will stay in that state until he hears the snapping of fingers. The hypnotherapy's counts to three, and then keels over from a heart attack. Peter sits there with a goofy look on his face, obviously still in some other world from his experience with hypnosis.The next morning the alarm clock goes off for Peter to go to work, and he rolls over and goes back to sleep. The phone rings several times, and his boss leaves a dozen or so messages for Peter, telling him that work started at the regular time, where is he, and so on. Peter eventually gets out of bed long enough to take a call from his girlfriend, then hang up on her, and go back to bed.Eventually he goes back to work with a new attitude about life, a new perspective on how things should be in an office environment. He shows up in casual clothes, brings fresh fish that he caught over the weekend to work and guts them on top of TPS reports, takes down the walls of his cubicle, plays tetris all day while eating snacks, and general shows a complete disregard for his job.Along with his friends he comes up with a get rich quick scheme at the expense of Initech in order to fund his quest of doing nothing for the rest of his life.The plot is pretty weak of course, but this isn't a movie that you watch for the plot. You watch it for the humour, and there is plenty in this movie, trust me.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (a great comedy)",Office Space

From a critical standpoint I'd give it a 8 but from an enjoyment standpoint I'd give it a 10Good:

In general I'm almost as allergic to office comedies as I am to offices but this is an exception.

Apart from that I have little to add to previous comments and I don't want to give anything away. Hilarious, see it.",Office Space
188,mazunderscore,A must see!,10,28 June 2006,"Office Space is one of those films that you have to watch over and over again. It's one of those films you want to make everyone else watch as well, over and over. I have very few films that I regard in this way.I've heard people say that they ""didn't understand"" this movie due to not ever having worked in an office environment. But surely everyone can understand what it's like to have a jerk boss like Mr. Lumburge, or to be forgotten like poor Milton, and especially to HATE your job but be too scared to quit as Peter, Michael and Samir do.The message of the movie is a simple but a great one. In the end, Peter found out he was happier doing a job that may be considered blue collar as apposed to the white collar office job he once had. He might have been making less money, but he was outside in the fresh air getting exercise and he didn't have to put up with sitting in a cubical for eight hours a day being told the same thing by four different bosses!Office Space is witty, clever and poignant, while at the same time being very true to life, both plot and character wise. The acting is spot on - especially Ron Livingston as Peter and even Jennifer Aniston as Joanna - the cinematography and music add to the feel of it perfectly.This movie is a MUST SEE! (over and over again) :)",Office Space

190,ClassicAndCampFilmReviews,"""Could you do that? That'd be greaaaaaaat.""",9,4 June 2005,"One of the funniest movies ever made, easily watchable several times a year, and always on my list of ""films to take along on the yearly beach trip in case it rains"". Anyone who's ever had to work in an office environment (I have, many times) will find something to love, as will anyone who's ever waitressed in a restaurant such as ""T.G.I. Friday's"" (ditto), that makes the employees wear idiotic uniforms involving wearing decorations such as buttons (called ""flair"" in this film).Mike Judge (creator of Beavis and Butthead, and he also has a cameo as the annoying supervisor at the restaurant) hits every right note in the film that really displayed Gary Cole's (""Fatal Vision"") comedic ability, and proved Jennifer Aniston, as Joanna, Peter's love interest, to be capable of much more than just being a TV ""Friend"". Her performance in ""Office Space"" resulted in her getting another ground-breaking part for her, in ""The Good Girl"". Ron Livingston (Peter Gibbons) is dead-on as the deadpanned, put-upon office worker who finally breaks free. Diedrich Bader (of The Drew Carey Show) in a small but notable part as Peter's construction-worker friend and neighbor is wonderfully funny, and almost unrecognizable under the long hair and drawl. Stephen Root (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"") is the Swingline-stapler loving underfoot underdog.All the smaller parts are fleshed out well and are hilarious in their own right, and each aspect of the film, while exaggerating the possible goings-on in the office world, exposes the inherent idiocies. This is one of those films that has spun out classic quotable lines from the first day it premiered.Did you get the memo?",Office Space
191,jaysilentbob37,"Highly recommended, even to those who don't work in a cubicle.",10,20 December 2005,"Office Space is Mike Judge's first live action film. He went for cheap laughs in Beavis and Butt-head, and in King of the Hill, he grew up, and used more mature humor. Here, in Office Space, he uses his dry-est comedy yet, and it's actually his funniest work.It's about a man named Peter (Ron Livingston), who is a cubicle slave at the software corporation called Ini-tech. It's a dull place, run by the snobbiest geek you could imagine, Bill Lumburgh (Gary Cole). Peter hates his job, and is really depressed about it. One day when he visits a hypnotherapist, who changes his perspective on life, and dies before he can get Peter out of the trans. Peter starts neglecting his job, and when he goes to work, he is a total jerk. When he finds out that he's being promoted for his negligence, and his best friends are being fired, he and his friends, Samir (Ajay Naidu), and Michael Bolton (not the singer) (David Herman), come up with a financial scheme to get back at their jackass boss.Office Space has been recommended only to people who work in cubicles. People say that they're the only ones who'll find it funny. That isn't true at all. I'm 14, haven't worked a day in my life, and think this is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. It doesn't have a single scatological, or anarchic gag. It's purely situational. You're laughing at the frustration of these poor guys. The boss, Lumburgh, is one of the funniest characters in movie history. His most commonly uttered phrase is ""Yeeeaaaaahhhh."" He seems friendly, maybe even is trying to be friendly. But he's just a snobby jerk, who's probably on the verge of getting his ass kicked. The first time you see this, there's a chance you'll find it boring. DO NOT reject it the first time around. It's is a comedic masterpiece, and is too funny. 10/10.It is rated R for Language and Brief Sexuality.

192,lerkim,A funny office comedy,9,3 March 2008,"There isn't that many movies that jokes about work in an Office, and for good reason, it isn't easy making a movie about people working in an Office and everything has to be around this Office, but this movie does just that with its funny jokes and these funny actors it works as a charm.Story: N/A The story is too simple to be voted on but that doesn't mean that it is not good, the storyline is just a little small and well for a movie about an Office that is perfectly fine. It is a movie that was based upon small animated films, and the story about the everlasting unlucky Milton who everyone overlooks. But the story is actually more about the main character Peter Gibbins who hates his job, and is living like it was hell everyday. From then on the movie tells a little story but still awesome one.Music: 9/10 I love rap and many other kinds and this movie is filled with rap, it is something you wont normally see in a movie about an Office but then again there isn't that much movies about it. Neverthelss it works in many ways course its fits in some weird way everywhere in the movie.Actors: 9/10 I don't know many of the actors in this movie i must admit, the only one i really noticed was Jennifer Aniston but that doesn't matter that much course the actors are playing so good that you actually will believe much of what they are going through. It is important when making such a joke, and especially if the movie shall stay funny all the way, and it does just that so great.Special Effects: N/A Well it is a joke movie don't expect anything less then camera angels turning in many ways, and some slow motion features, but then again it shouldn't matter anyway.Overall: 9/10 A great movie, simple one, really simple one but great, you will love this and you can easily relate to everything about the Office if you have worked in one before. It is worth watching and i would buy it many times if i lost it everyday it is a good sample for a movie collection and should be in every home in the world.Love it...",Office Space
193,jzathajenious,"One of my all time fave comedies, endlessly rewatchable!",9,19 February 2008,"A movie that snuck up on me, Office Space is one of those films i saw for the first time and went 'meh'. It was OK, but i had heard this film had such a devoted following, i was expecting big things. But over the years i have for whatever reason wanted to come back time and time again and revisit it. its one of the very few movies that after about 10-15 viewings just does not get stale or boring. its not laugh out loud funny, but its situations are captured with such an observant eye, you cant help but identify with the characters and smile in acknowledgment as you recognize a similar situation in your own workplace.I think Office Space is a great comedy because it has these moments of true honesty and real life situations that ring true, mixed with outlandish fantasy scenes. destroying the copier is a perfect example; we all would love to do it to that irritating piece of crap machine at work that never co-operates, but unlike the movie, we cannot. but in office space we are able to live out these outlandish fantasies: destroying office equipment, sticking it to your annoying boss, ripping the company off. its a cathartic experience and i think a huge part of why many, including myself, find it such an enjoyable experience to re-visit time and time again.But this is only one of many reasons this movie is so beloved, it has quotable lines and really likable characters too.I give it 9/10.",Office Space

The characters could have been used more wisely and for more comedic scenes. I would say it is watchable once and that is it.If you want to laugh, find something else. This isn't the great movie people make it out to be.

It all rings gruesomely true, because the performances make it so credible: it may be hard to believe in anyone as terminally nerdish as Milton, but he was very well played, and so was the Lumbergh character. I suspect everyone who reviewed this has commented joyfully on the complete mashing of the printer - also, maybe, everyone who has ever used a PC or a Mac and got enraged when it throws a snit and decides not to boot up or to crash or just not to do something for its own arcane reasons.My only regret was not seeing much of the divine Jennifer Aniston.

I remember screwing up something small and hearing about it from two different bosses and then one of my buddies. Sheesh! I know I messed up, I don't need everyone telling me! I was in a cubical and I remember my boss coming by with a big cup of coffee every day. My immediate supervisor's name was Bill. I also can do quite the Bill Lumbergh impersonation. I leave voice mails for my employees running late to work as him sometimes. Everybody at my work makes constant references to this movie. We all love it, me especially. Mike Judge put a great one together here. The acting is great, the story is very believable. We all have experienced a lot of the frustration that's depicted in this movie from the bosses to the crazy co-workers. This keeps you entertained from beginning to end with no dead spots. Gary Cole's performance would have to be my favorite (especially the dream sequence). Dietrich Bader is great as Lawrence too. I actually had a neighbor like him once too.

I saw this movie because my husband saw it at a friend's house and borrowed it and insisted I see it.Every few minutes, I kept saying, ""I have LIVED this movie.  I have WORKED with those people.  I have SUFFERED in that cube farm.""  And I laughed.  I laughed harder than I've laughed at a movie in years.  I laughed because it's dark and raw and cynically funny, not because it's what passes for comedy these days (raunchy sex and language that would make a sailor blush--though that can be funny too; see JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK for a great example).Mike Judge (of BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD and KING OF THE HILL fame) brings to life a Dilbert-esque fantasy through the eyes of everyman Peter Gibbons, cube farm dot-com slave working on fixing the Y2K problem and hating every moment of his miserable work existence.  He's got eight bosses (one of whom is played by Gary Cole in a performance so magnificent that you will wonder if he shadowed your boss for a few days to get acting tips--he's that realistic), all of whom jump his case whenever he makes mistakes.  He's surrounded by the lady with the annoying voice, co-workers cursing at a broken fax machine, the old timer who sees layoffs around every corner...and Milton, the weird guy we've all seen in our offices, the mumbler, the nervous wreck, the guy we all take bets on when he'll snap and go postal.  A visit to a hypnotherapist turns Peter's life around, and he stops caring about his job...just as two efficiency consultants arrive to review company practices and procedures.  But instead of getting fired, Peter gets a promotion while his two best friends get fired, and the three of them plot to take their revenge on the nameless, faceless corporation making their lives miserable.Look for Jennifer Aniston in a very nice small role as a waitress at a TGIFriday-esque restaurant who becomes Peter's girlfriend and learns to stand up for herself at her job. Look fast or you'll miss Orlando (7-Up) Jones in a bit part that is so funny and so real that you'll wonder how long he studied those guys who go door-to-door with the magazine subscriptions. But most of all, look at the atmosphere of this film and marvel at how eerily accurate it is.

There's an actual plot (that has the general idea later seen in Horrible Bosses), some terrific characterization and acting, and lots of witty dialogs that can be referenced in daily life for years. I think it is a great film for the 9-5 sufferers to connect with and rise up and do something that makes them happy. You know, it is actually a good message for the newly graduated to not be chained by what they are ""supposed to do"". Besides that, the parody of an office is simply fantastic. They covered all the usual characters, Lumbergh being the best one by far. All in all, quite enjoyable. The rating would have been a lot higher if the comedy was less subdued.

It shows his struggles with his work life and his horrible bosses and his quest to get Jennifer Aniston's character. Along the way are a bunch of other characters that are equally hilarious to our protagonist and play incredibly well off of each other. The blend of all the characters creates the one of the best ensemble casts for a comedy in recent memory. Everything in this film was executed with skill.

214,bobtaurus,"Nice Attack, Poor Follow Through",6,1 February 2005,"The first half hour or so of ""Office Space"" is thoroughly enjoyable, particularly if you've spent any time, as I have, working in an office. There are wonderful caricatures of the annoying people, procedures and machines that one inevitably encounters in an office environment that are laugh-out-loud funny.Unfortunately, much of the rest of the film is devoted to a plot that is predictable and uninteresting. It just doesn't maintain the hilarity established at the movie's start.The casting, I must say, is wonderful. The many character actors shine in their roles.",Office Space
215,Gareth_Hacking,"It's funny, plain and simple",8,23 January 2003,"Office Space came out rather quietly straight onto video in the U.K. country, a shame really but no surprise considering its biggest star is Jennifer Anniston and hers is only a support role. Our hero her is Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), an officer worker who is put in hypnotic state where he is extremely relaxed and can't be snapped out of it. Why recommend this film then? Because it's funny, plain and simple. It is the first live action film written and directed by Mike Judge (he of Beavis and Butthead infamy). Based on this evidence he should definitely make more. Reasons to watch the film: All the supporting characters are memorable, From Gibbon's two sidekicks: Samir Nayeenanajar (a surname nobody can pronounce) and Michael Bolton (a name that does not go unnoticed) too Milton and Peter's next door neighbour Lawrence. Best of all is Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) oozes slime from every pore of his body. Also the Gangster rap soundtrack is superb. What are you waiting for, go and watch it now!",Office Space
216,gere-c,A funny and simplistic comedy,6,25 November 2015,"Peter Gibbons is a man tired of your life and work, in a moment of utter exhaustion and sadness, undergoes a hypnosis session, completely changing their behavior. With that, he begins to completely rebel jobs and in life, doing whatever want, whenever want. Everything seems to go wrong and be dismissed - for just cause -, right? No, it's like that than everything starts to go right with him, getting everything, and, even without caring, still works.And so goes the film has enough funny scenes, many simple, but some really forced, in my opinion. But even so, the spectator can take some good laughter. The problem is that the film, despite the funny scenes, ends up not exploring much that could exploit, making not have much history and not much depth on each piece of the film, maybe because the film is short, there is not much between your rebel by the end, it's all very quick and simplistic, without much exploration of thematic or characters. Besides, the movie has absence of logic in some parts, especially in various situations where his boss, Bill Lumbergh, even seeing Peter do things that would be layoffs in any job, do not dismiss it. But, of course, if it happens, the film would lose big part the theme.The film's it. It's cool, fun to watch, yields good laugh, but do not expect anything too deep or well produced.

218,Bob_647,An eccentric cry at modern burocracy with its own funny quirkiness.,9,13 June 2020,"As the movie opens, a cubicle slave named Peter (Ron Livingston) is being reminded by his smarmy supervisor (Gary Cole) that all reports now carry a cover sheet. ""Yes, I know,"" he says. ""I forgot. It was a silly mistake. It won't happen again."" Before long another manager reminds him about the cover sheets. ""Yes, I know,"" he says. Then another manager. And another. Logic suggests that when more than one supervisor conveys the same trivial information, their jobs overlap, and all supervisors after the first one should be shredded.Peter and his friends have a permanent case of 'the Mondays.' Stuck in dead end programming jobs in an uncaring corporate environment, with a series of ridiculous, annoying and dysfunctional co-workers, Peter has motivation problems. At the request of his equally aggravating girlfriend, he subjects himself to occupational therapy via hypnotism, but just as he reaches a deep trance state, the hypnotist drops dead, and Peter is left in a state of blissful lack of inhibitions. And as things begin to go wrong, they actually get better - through the films twisted (but oh so truthful) logic.Easily one of my favorite comedies, and sort of a source of medicine for the pains of working in an office with complete idiots. Ahh, cubicle life. Anyone who's ever worked in a corporate office can relate to this film on some level, and can probably swear that they know someone exactly like one of the characters depicted here. Mike Judge really captures the aspect that makes office life so miserable, which is without a doubt the characters that you must deal with that your personal life would normally exclude. There is no question that he must've had his own bout with the way of the office bitch, as he shows that he knows it all too well. Out of the comedies I've seen, I can most identify with this one.Peter is in love with the waitress at the chain restaurant across the parking lot. Her name is Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and she has problems with management, too. She's required to wear a minimum of 15 funny buttons on the suspenders of her uniform; the buttons are called ""flair"" in company lingo, and her manager suggests that wearing only the minimum flair suggests the wrong spirit (another waiter has ""45 flairs"" and looks like an exhibit at a trivia convention).The movie's dialogue is smart. It doesn't just chug along making plot points. Consider, for example, Michael Bolton's plan for revenge against the company. He has a software program that would round off payments to the next-lowest penny and deposit the proceeds in their checking account. Hey, you're thinking--that's not original! A dumb movie would pretend it was.Arguably one of the most quotable movies of today's average working stiff's generation. Lumberg and Milton are such classic characters you must be seriously independently wealthy and never worked a day in your life to not be able to identify with a classic movie like Office Space. Thank goodness dudes like Mike Judge exist in Hollywood. I can't imagine a world without a great little flick like this still kicking around. While it would never be considered Oscar type material, I can't help but to think that after all these years, this movie remains among the most tragically over-looked and under appreciated comedies. For no great critical reason other than pure fun factor and pop culture relevance, Office Space remains firmly, a true classic of our time.",Office Space

I have to wake up at 6 for my job and my job is a lot harder than theirs. The main character even admits he only does about 15 minutes of work in a given week. He says he doesn't like his boss. I actually like my boss. All they do is sit around in an office I would love to have a job like that. I would rather sit on my childhood sit and spin and spin until I felt nauseous the amount of fun involved would be about the equivalent. All I do is work and go to school favorite interest (beer).All my friends are just like the people in this movie. Erwin helps some kid in a wheelchair, but he doesn't do anything. Steve works at a resturaunt and gets to do whatever he wants. Josh works on the grounds crew, but he doesn't do anything. I got Brendan the Sourcerer hired, but he quit after LESS than a week! I put my neck out for him and he didn't even last a week. Not only that but I got this situation, my bed broke, I hurt my neck rough housing with my sister, I got sick in Canada I think I got the flu. I worked about 2000 cases today cuz of labor day weekend and I don't ask for sympathy, but the guys in this movie do.In conclusion, never watch this movie.

Well, Office Space is another movie I can add to the list. The movie is funny, brilliant, smart, and a little bit darker than I thought. And I liked it a lot.I didn't like everything in this movie. Some of the scenes feels a little bit old. Not just the quality, but the way they're made. The movie came out in 1999, and I guess the movie wouldn't have been made today. This is old fashioned humour, but it is still funny. If the movie had been made today, I guess some of the scenes would look cooler, but the movie is still smart and genius in almost everything it does.I really liked Ron Livingston in the main role, and Jennifer Aniston made a funny role as the waitress who gets together with Ron Livingston. It's not that many famous people in this movie, but they I really liked the most of them.

I think what is good about the movie is almost everyone can relate to working a job they hate and this movie depicts what many of us would like to do - just walk out.

227,TomC-5,A great cast make this a satisfactory comedy,8,15 April 2000,"OFFICE SPACE starts off hysterically, and imaginatively, deriving full humor from such things as traffic jams, annoying co-workers, unpleasant cubicles, and malfunctioning office equipment, with this setting the stage for what follows; a large, soulless corporation is bringing in consultants, and people are about to be ""downsized"" (i.e., fired). Peter, the protagonist, has a moment of clarity and begins to treat his job with complete indifference, leading to the absurdity of his promotion; then, showing both bravado and loyalty to his downsized buddies, he cooks up a scheme which will both exact revenge on the company and make himself and his friends rich. He'll then be able to devote himself full time to a life of complete slackerdom.A secondary story involves Peter's relationship with a waitress at Chotchkes, a Fridays/Chiles type chain restaurant where the employees suffer indignities all their own.And then there's Milton, the obese, coke-bottle eyeglasses wearing, zero social skilled employee back at the main workplace. Milton gets pushed around once too often until he takes sweet revenge - the result is both richly satisfying and very funny.While OFFICE SPACE is generally a very funny comedy, it doesn't necessarily sustain the uproarious humor with which it starts. Nevertheless, it manages to have a lot going for it, and achieves a fairly strong level of populist satisfaction; you can't help but cheer for the screwballs and slackers as they set out to destroy their evil workplace. It's also one of the best cast movies I've ever seen. The actors playing Milton, Michael Bolton, the two Bobs, etc. all manage to bring just the right level of quirkiness to their parts. They don't overact, and they're not over the top. Nevertheless, they're memorable.My grade = 8 out of a possible 10.",Office Space

It pokes fun at office conventions, takes the mickey out of the bureaucratic, corporate mentality, examines peoples attempts at being human beings in a dehumanizing environment, and it does so in a light hearted, unpretentious way. The reason this film still resonates is because it touched on truths, and made people laugh at the absurdity of conformity and hollow authority.

229,redfearnb,Stick it to the man with Office Space!,9,16 March 2006,"I would absolutely LOVE to see Ron Livingston on an episode of The Office. Office Space has to be one of the best tech comedies of the decade (90's). Even at seven years old now, a special edition DVD was just re-released during the Christmas season.Peter (Ron Livingston) is an unhappy software developer for Initech, which is helping banks make the famed Y2K conversion with their computer software. Peter goes to a hypnotherapist who hypnotizes him (big surprise) into a relaxed attitude about his life. Peter starts not caring about work and ends up being promoted in his ""not lazy, just unmotivated"" job. Before two of his coworkers are laid-off, Peter masterminds a plot to steal money from the bank accounts. After the plan goes bad, Peter and his friends fear for their futures until the software company burns down, destroying all of the evidence that convicted the three conspirators.I love the characters and especially relate to Michael Bolton, the white computer nerd who thinks he is a gangster. The humor is great as well, especially to those familiar with the corporate scene and techys alike. While somewhat crude at times, the TV version cleans up the bad language and besides that, there is only one scene that might make a conservative viewer a bit uncomfortable.I love it and have to watch it every time it comes on TV again.

I would like to say it was in large part an exaggeration of office life, but its not. It gave me chills as it made me laugh.""Office Space"" is Mike Judge's opus to the banality of life inside a cubicle. The sanitary, grey universe of office space in which Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) must work is driving him crazy. He confesses to a hypno-psychiatrist that each day he spends at work is worse than the last day and so every day he is living through the worst day of his life. Every day Peter is bombarded with mundane questions like whether he got the memo about using a new cover sheet. If he seems down trodden his co-workers ask if he has a case of 'the Mondays.' Life for him is a living hell. Actually, a living purgatory may be more like it.When visiting a hypno-psychiatrist, Peter is put into a trance and told to act without inhibitions. The psychiatrist conveniently dies of a heart attack while Peter is in the trance and thus a new Peter is born – one without the submission reflex, a man driven to act out. When asked to work on a Saturday, Peter decides to skip work. When he's questioned by efficiency experts about what his job, he tells them he has no motivation and so only works fifteen minutes a week. When he goes fishing, he decides to gut the fish at his desk.This onset of rebellious behavior leads Peter to ask out Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) the waitress he sees every day at a local restaurant. She agrees to a date and promptly becomes the romantic subplot of the movie.Later, when Peter finds out two of his best friends at the company (David Herman as Michael and Ajay Naidu as Samir) are going to be laid off, they conspire to put a computer virus into the company's system that would steal a few pennies each day. As one character notes, this is a crime lifted from ""Superman III"" and some guys from the 70s who got arrested.The funniest part of ""Office Space"" is the first act when we are introduced to Peter's prosaic existence and then his subsequent lashing out. Once the crime plot is revealed, I feel the movie loses some momentum. This could have been a comic tour de force if it hadn't felt the need to introduce a plot. I would have liked ""Office Space"" better if instead of the crime scheme, we simply watched a story where Peter's bad behavior in fact gave him promotion after promotion until he had some kind of inevitable fall.But ""Office Space"" is funny enough. I liked it. I also really like Milton, the character who had his origins in Mike Judge's SNL cartoons and inspired this film. Milton is a down trodden employee who never gets cake and keeps getting his cubicle moved. Ultimately, all he really wants is to keep his stapler. Its nice that he triumphs in the end. We all have a right to our stapler.Rating:On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""Batman Returns""Rationalization:There is an inner rage in this film that is very compelling. When stripped away from its white-gray palette ""Office Space"" is as red as Milton's stapler and angry as Milton's disposition. I think ""Office Space"" has become such a hit because it speaks to two embedded (and opposing) desires in the American (if not the human) spirit: 1) to scream out to the universe that your existence matters 2) to be lazy. The inanity of office life does all it can to crush both those desires and it does it in the name of making more money. ""Office Space,"" presents a dystopia that we can believe in because we have seen it or lived in it. Thank God at least that we can sometimes laugh at it.http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/",Office Space

And when I saw the previews of Office Space, I expected some very high-quality humor.The Good News: I got a lot of what I was looking for. The Bad News: I got less than I wanted.The movie centers on the idea that Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) decides to stop putting up with his job.  He does all sorts of outrageous things along his path to revenge (non-spoilers - from the previews) like putting a fish in a box of papers, and knocking down his cubicle wall.  Absolutely brilliant.And then, the movie takes a wrong turn.  This stuff was funny, and I would've liked to keep seeing that kind of joke continue, but instead, the plot changes direction when a couple of Peter's buddies who get laid off decide to help him rip the company off.  Then it becomes a big angstful ""did I do something wrong""-fest, and it's far less funny.

The story is concise and tidy, the script is clever, and the characterizations are spot on, especially the infamous mid-level executive Bill Lumbergh, as portrayed by Gary Cole (whose work as a sports commentator in Dodgeball is also remarkable).The talented Ron Livingston (Band of Brothers) lends credibility to the zany story and cast, alternating between sea-sick despair and zen-like transcendence. The supporting cast, most notably Jennifer Aniston, David Herman, Ajay Naidu, Diedrich Bader, Stephen Root, Gary Cole, Richard Riehle, and John C. McGinley are consistently funny and remain within their characters. As mentioned above, Cole's Lumbergh is so believable that it has achieved cult status.Acute observations of everyday life make this film memorable: the man on the walker passing commuter traffic as the main character Peter (Livingston) vainly switches from one stopped lane to another; Chotchkie's, the soulless chain eatery that offers such delectable appetizers as ""pizza shooters"" and ""extreme fajitas;"" Peter's apartment, with its paper-thin walls and omniscient next-door neighbor, the ribald construction worker Lawrence (Bader); and of course the office itself, replete with malfunctioning office machines, mind-eating and soul-devouring managers, and the receptionist Nina, whose entire day is spent in a sing-song repetitive greeting as she puts callers on hold.

I take issue with other reviews and synopses that say this movie is about getting revenge for being laid off - that's such a pedestrian view of the situation.  At least 75% of this movie is about office life seen through the eyes of someone who manages to be mentally removed from the office grind and politics - and it's in this realm where we find the most comedy and insight.You see, a hypnotic suggestion makes Peter permanently believe all of his work-related cares are unimportant.  Office politics and job performance no longer matter.  I believe that only a disaffected office worker can truly understand and enjoy this film - we are the ones who double over laughing with tears streaming down our faces, the ones who nod mutely in sympathy and agreement, the ones who quote it day in and day out, even when you have no idea we're doing it.  But there is plenty of humor here for everyone, including Jennifer Aniston's perfectly-toned turn as a waitress at Chotchkie's (""wait, I think I can see a T.G.I. Friday's menu in the background of that shot!"") Restaurant, and Stephen Root's impeccable performance as Milton Waddams, the man nobody got around to firing.""Office Space"" is for office workers the way ""Clerks"" is for retail employees.  It knows all the in jokes, feels your pain, and crosses the line just far enough to be exhilarating when you get to watch someone do what you've always wanted but never been able to do.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this movie - which has been viewed so many times in our house we might actually wear out the DVD - is how it feels like it's maintaining a level of calm and a deliberate pace (despite the outlandish events throughout).  This is a testament to Mike Judge's skill as both writer and director - he infuses the entire film with the peace and serenity Peter gains through his hypnotic suggestion, in the midst of the madness.A true sleeper, a cult classic, and in my opinion, a 9 out of 10.",Office Space

A great contradiction, you might think, but the fact is that B & B was a VERY funny and intelligent tv-series, even though most people considered it immature and offensive. The movie was even better than the series, and though critics didn't like it it had a huge audience who loved it, and for a reason.Judge isn't afraid to dive beneath the surface, and reveal a world where no one is perfect, and to question the very society and the values that we are fed up with. Whether it's about work or adolescence, Judge refuses to compromise, and shows everything how it is. That's where the comedy lies, in the truth. Judge shows the neuroses of office workers, their bosses and their basic human desire for freedom, that finally drives the main protagonist to his own personal revolution against his work, the system, and most of all himself. And believe it or not, all this is hilarious!Office Space is one of the few comedies that are to be taken seriously, amongst others like ""Something About Mary"", or ""The Truman Show"", and therefor I think it deserves a place besides the other more perceptive films of 1999 like ""American Beauty"", or ""Happiness"".

If you don't laugh out loud during this movie you are either totally humor-impaired or you have never worked a day in your life.The Fridays-esque ""Tchotchke's"" restaurant with it's over-hyped waiter selling ""extreme fajitas"", mumbling Milton taking endless abuse from a slick-talking do-nothing Porsche-driving Bill Lumbergh, the ""Goodfellas""-style destruction of the always uncooperative fax machine, Peter cleaning fish at his desk, being outpaced by an old man with a walker during the impossibly frustrating traffic on the way to work, Michael Bolton's fear of letting a black man hear him pumping gangster rap, the list of truly funny scenes in ""Office Space"" just goes on and on.Too bad the plot that ties it all together is trite, boring and stupid.  In the end, it really doesn't matter that much as the gaps between funny scenes are so small that you don't really care what moves you from scene to scene anyways, but with a more thought-out plot that was as inspired as its individual scenes, ""Office Space"" might have been one of the greatest movies ever.  As it is, I gave it a solid 8, it will not fail to entertain, just don't bother keeping track of what's going on.",Office Space
242,dr_mario_rules,Mike Judge delivers his comedic skills in a great movie.,9,16 January 2008,"I have never worked in a cubicle, and I will never, now! Ron Livingston stars in this hilarious comedy about working in an office, as Peter Gibbons. Others with him include Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, Peter's girlfriend. David Herman as Micheal Bolton, (no relation) a frustrated worker. Finally, Ajay Naidu as Samir Nagheenanajar, another frustrated worker at the dreaded Initech.Ron hates his job and is trying to work things out with his 1st girlfriend Anne at a counselor, but when the counselor dies in front of him, just as he is put in a state of complete bliss. He realizes he must make the most out of his time on this Earth. So he skips his job and ignores his boss. Meanwhile, Anne dumps him and admits she's been cheating on him. That day Peter gets enough confidence to ask the waiter at his favorite restaurant out, Joanna and she says yes. Right after the lunch with her he goes to his job to get his address book. While he is there, Intech decides to downsize and interview people. They decide to fire Micheal Bolton and Samir Nagheenanajar but give Peter a promotion. Angry about this, the three use a virus to steal money from Intech.I loved this movie, I as a matter of fact love all of Mike Judge's work, from King of the Hill to The Animation Show, although I hate Beavis and Butthead.

Mike Judge has done an exellent job with this movie, and has delivered all-daily jokes about all-daily work in a nasty kind of way.  But of course, the best pieces is when the cast really flipps and gives us the big laughs.The best part is, of course, the part when the dude from the office goes bananas on the copy machine, and totally smashes it to pieces with a baseball racket.

244,the rock-17,Excellent first-time effort for Mike Judge!,9,31 August 1999,"This was a hilarious movie, and an excellent directing debut for Mike Judge, who is behind MTV's Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill.  This movie talks about a few friends and coworkers who try to bring their company, Initech, down because of the unfair employment and downsizing that is taking place.  With great characters in the movie, from the main character, Ron Livingston, to his next door neighbor, to Michael Bolton (that's the character's name, not the singer.  He was the funniest character in the movie!).  I think one of the funniest scenes was when they take the copying machine out into plain grass, and the three guys have baseball bats with them, and Mike Judge has the film going in slow motion, almost like there is going to be a showdown between the Initech workers and the corrupt copying machine.  This movie was hilarious, and I'll see anything that has Jennifer Aniston in it (call me).  I liked Ron Livingston with his work in Swingers (which was also a very funny movie), so I was familiar with the type of character he could play.  Although I am not a huge fan of Beavis and Butthead or King of the Hill for that matter, I still thought this was one good time at the theater that was worth the price of admission (and go buy it on DVD, it came out today)!

I have experienced this first hand right down to my boss saying to me *TRUE STORY* ""Um, yeah...if you could just answer the phones for the next week that'd be greeaaat."" I swear. It happened. Milton is fabulous. (Since I am an Office Space cult freak I know this, but for you first-timers: Pay attention to Milton's mumblings, he says he's going to ""burn the building down."") The scene with the bat and the copier/fax machine in the field is a dream come true. Michael Bolton is a great character. He's so nerdy and white but he listens to heavy gangster rap and it is so great, when he's in the car and he's next to a black guy, he rolls his window up!!!! Samir is hilarious too.

So, when his hypnotist passes out after granting this wish, he is left carefree... just in time for performance reviews alongside his friends Michael Bolton and Samir Nag...heen...an...ajar. Not only does he get promoted, but he also falls in love with the ridiculously hot Joanna.In a subplot, the squirrelly, insecure Milton Waddams is tormented by department manager Bill Lumbergh; his desk is constantly moved around, he is denied a piece of birthday cake, his paycheck is cancelled, and, the last straw, Lumbergh takes his red Swingline stapler.Peter employs Michael's cunning plan of using a special software program to steal pennies from the company, but it malfunctions and begins taking huge piles of money from the company account.

247,alxx0209,Umm Yeah it just needed a little more spark,7,12 April 2013,"I heard about this movie for a long time from a few people and I also read about it becoming a cult classic now a days. So I had to watch this movie. Before I watched it though I read about it and to me all I was reading said Nerds rebel / take revenge . So it sounded goodish then I found out the only name I recognized in the film was Jennifer Aniston - ( who I loved on Friends who plays Rachel ) it almost seems like they should have just used a nobody as Joanna or an actress who fit in with the other actors - it would have saved them a chunk of money < Im guessing > however she did a good job in a part that kind of loses its place.So how was the film ? I agree with a lot of people on here saying the first half of the film was hilarious and was a bit of Déjà vu - in a good way. The famous printer scene was like WOW / I should do that to my computer or cellphone/ printer/ TV / or whatever . That Scene just made me laugh so much. Ron Livingston who looks like a combination of Brendan Fraser and Tim Robbins ( yet acts like Ferris Bueller) plays the role Peter who was interesting , I was impressed how much he just let go . I loved Michael Bolton and Samir Nagheenanajar - even there names , I got a giant chuckle out of there names , so creative ! and unique way better then naming a character John smith or Tim Adams or anything boring / dull . I need to give those two actors credit as well. Next thing I want to say is you do not need to work in an office to understand and like / love this film. Those computers reminded me of the computers in Highschool doing stupid crap and wanting to beat the heck out of it lol. Bill Lumbergh ( who kinda resembles Ed Rooney) has no time fooling around and is the villain. All he cares about is the tps reports and no ones feelings ( like Milton and peter ) - He was so annoying ( yet amusing). He disappeared at the end and that was disappointing.what else ?? Well I enjoyed the film the first half of the movie was hilarious but second half just kinda felt lacking a bit of funny scenes or even a little more heart at the end. I thought Peter and Joanna could have been together more. They just needed to add something to the end somehow. Other then that decent soundtrack , actors were great , being able to know what they have gone through , dialogue was spot on * like anything Peter says and I can understand why its a cult classic / I can understand why some love it and others not so much. There's enough ""meat"" in the film though to enjoy it in my opinion .",Office Space

I can really relate to this film on many levels. I can often relate with Pete, Michael, and Samir, having horrible bosses and getting shafted at every corner. I find Peter's attitude after the hypnotherapist dies in front of him. That mindset is just fabulous, and compliments the hatred of other employees quite well. I especially enjoy the meeting with the consultants. That knocks me on my ass every time. The scene where they destroy the printer in the field reflects quite well on the frustration with computer hardware. Many things that are often found in the counter culture.

I don't have to know any of his other work, I know this as a fact just from watching this one movie. If you have ever worked in an office setting like this you will understand the genius of Mike Judge. This movie is hilarious.The lead actor didn't add much to the movie, he is easily replaced. Jennifer Aniston was miscast. The actors this movie CAN NOT do without are as follows, in no particular order. I will use their character names since I don't want to bother looking up their real names:Michael Bolton, Samir, Lumberg, Bob Slydell, the restaurant manager (Mike Judge), Brian the waiter, Dr. Swanson and Milton. Stephen Root who played Milton was robbed of an Academy Award for his brilliant work in this film.

Mike Judge nails the monotony, the pettiness, and general stupidity of the TEAM CORPORATION! environment that corporations create. Look, we understand, we have to work for you, but don't for godsakes make us sing a song every morning or go on some retarded company retreat. And most of all, stop telling us we're part of a team or, even worse, part of a family. You are not my family. My family can't fire me. You can. So. Stop. It.The hollowness and absurdity of modern corporate life is brilliantly portrayed here and even though this movie was made in the late 90's, it still resonates perfectly for today.Mike Judge would go on to make what I consider his Magnum Opus, 'Idiocracy' (one of the greatest comedies ever made), but this was a fantastic waystation.I believe you have my stapler?",Office Space
253,mike-wright-1,A mixed bag,6,18 December 2012,"There's no doubt about it, Office Space has touches of genius. The traffic jam, the multiple levels of management, the consultants, the battles with the printer, the restaurant boss and more. They are all very keenly observed and can be related to by all but the luckiest among us.The downside is that just about all of these things are introduced in the first quarter of the movie – which is where Mike Judge packs 90% of the laughs. I've seen two films where Ron Livingston is the lead. From a script viewpoint, Swingers is everything Office Space isn't. Had I seen Office Space first I would have been tempted to avoid Swingers for fear that the lead was a horrible actor. However the truth is that the script for Office Space is at times awful (particularly in the last twenty minutes when the big moments between the two leads arrive). Aniston and Livingston come across very poorly and it really isn't their fault.I suspect Office Space is a grower. Milton no doubt becomes even funnier the more you see him and other subtleties of humour will shine through. The mind will adjust to the clunky script and accept that these are not, and never could be, real conversations. First impressions are though that Mike Judge is far more adept at the shorter game, even if he does bring enough splashes of brilliance to edge a thumbs up.",Office Space
254,towelie2002,One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made!,10,9 February 2004,"I honestly don't think there's enough good things to say about Office Space. It has everything a great film needs: A great story, great acting, great jokes, great soundtrack, great everything! Hell, we even get to like the characters, as with most films no one cares. Even though this is a comedy, it actually deals with a very big issue: disillusionment. And most comedies of this type don't do that sort of thing.The disillusioned Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) has an office job at Innitech that he really hates to the point where he confesses that everyday is the worse day of this life because of it. He has two disillusioned friends there: Michael Bolton (David Herman), who gets a lot of harassment due to him having the same name as the singer, and Samir (Ajay Naidu), an Indian immigrant who just wants to keep his job. Two other men who work with them are Tom (Richard Riehle), a man who wants to make a `Jump To Conclusions Mat' to get rich, and Milton (Stephen Root), a mumbling man who can't stand up for himself. Their boss is the evil Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), who makes them work on the weekend and torments everyone, especially Milton. Peter loves Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress at a restaurant he often goes to that he loves, but can't ask her out due to having no confidence and a pushy girlfriend named Anne (Alexandra Wentworth). After being hypnotized by a hypnotist that dies before he can complete the process, Peter gains all the confidence he needs to decide to not quit his job, but just not to go, ask Joanna out and leave Anne. But surprisingly, instead of getting fired, he gets promoted, while his hardworking friends get fired. After this, they decide to get their revenge by putting a computer virus in Innitech's computers to slowly make millions, but it goes horribly wrong.I love this movie. I really do. Even when I first show the trailer for this in cinema about 5 or 6 years ago when I was about 11 years old I thought it'd be a good movie, and how right was I? Beyond 100% right! All the actors do a great job in this, especially Ron Livingston, who should've got a lot of acclaim for this film. I honestly hope his career becomes really successful someday. I also loved Peter's neighbor Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), who is hilarious. There are other great comedies out there, like Wayne's World (1992) and Joe Dirt (2001), but this is just movie magic! Director Mike Judge is a comic genius! Who thought that the toilet humour of Beavis and Butthead could be beaten by office humour? I hope everyone involved in this film continues to make great films like this.Oh, and just before I finish this review, I have to say one thing. Even though I love this film to death, I honestly hope they don't make a sequel. This is just one of those rare films that are perfect, and I don't want an inferior sequel(s) to ruin this. A sequel should only be done if it's just as funny (if funnier) than this. And besides, the plot has no where to go, so they should leave this alone. The best way I can sum this film up: A brilliant classic!Rating: 5/5!!!",Office Space

If I am not mistaken, this movie came out during the time and interim along with such movies as notting hill and a few others ,all of which had similar overtones in their theme to them, but given the audiences short attention span, and their craving for variety this phase ended just as suddenly and just as shortly as it started. In a rather unassuming , casual and unintentional manner, this movie answers the question which had always plagued and bothered me which was, should art imitate life, or should life imitate art ? Anyone who has seen movies based on real life true stories, even if they be just documentaries, and news reels will attest to the fact that the drama, the emotion, and the suspense in real life far exceeds and is by far way better than the drama in a fictional tale. Fact always trump's fiction, and I am not using that word as an expression of my solidarity with the opinions, views and policies of the erstwhile President of United States, although having seen what I have seen and knowing what I know, I will not rush to pronounce judgement on anyone regarding any matter.

So just for time pass I searched for positive reviews of his other films. I saw that Office Space had got a good rating and decided to watch it, and lo and behold !!! I was simply blown over. I mean this is seriously ""CLASS A"" stuff man !!! When I saw that this movie had released in 1999, I was just simple taken aback !!! How come such a wonderful director like Mike Judge made a movie like Extract ! (I mean c'mon Extract was nothing compared to this !) The direction was spot on. The acting was spellbinding. The script was well written and cohesive and I would like to mention something special regarding the acting.Ron Livingston, David Herman and Ajay Naidu were Awesome but the person who really steals the show and takes the cake(pun intended !) here is hands down ""Stephen Roots aka Milton Waddams"".He just sinks his teeth in the role which fits him to the T and which according to me is nothing short at all of an award worthy performance(Meaning just look at him, he is so cute; has an amazing screen presence and the way in which he underplays his role, it speaks volumes about the actor). Jennifer Aniston was okay in a role that did not require her to display ample histrionics.What to say, if you are a fan of Mike Judge and even have a passing interest in movies related to office life, just give it a go (Trust me, you are not going to regret it!) I cannot remember myself laughing out loud so much at a movie recently and watch out for the rap at the end of the movie !P.S.: Last words which I would like to say to Mike Judge Sir are:- ""Sir please just continue to make movies like Office Space and kindly don't disappoint us with movies like Extract.

The added bonus will be for those who work in the IT field .The movie is blatantly truthful and helps to explain the dynamics of an office environment well. In fact I had used this an example during a case study (during my MBA days), to explain the key highlights of a dysfunctional work environment. Without spoiling the movie, one of the dysfunctional things is that the main character in the movie reports to 5 bosses (or managers). Thus, he feels that if he does anything wrong, his mistake gets pointed out 5 times. Besides that there is an amazing printer bashing scene in the movie, which i think many of us will be able to connect to again.In a nutshell, this one is a hilarious catch, especially for the working class who think that their job is mundane.

""King of the Hill"" showed that Mike Judge can do more than Beavis 'n' Butthead, and this film solidifies that.",Office Space

From the mumbling Milton to Samir's classic statements to the perky waiter, the writers provide a wide variety of quirky characters.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is excellent, but had _Dilbert: the movie_ come out already, everyone would be bashing this clone, rather than laughing out loud.",Office Space

Just like I stated in the summary required viewing for CEO's. This movie runs a close second to Fast Times at Ridgemont High for me. Not the same subject but intelligently written and directed. I think most people can identify with the main characters plight. An underdog unappreciated by his employer and girlfriend. I think many people fantasize about being completely honest with their boss and get rewarded by it.What makes it work is that it take a simple idea and runs with it. It has known actors but no major stars which adds to it's charm. And has us all asking Peter What's Happening?,Office Space

If you have ever worked in an office, you can relate to practically ever single character in this movie, and if you have not worked in an office, you still will laugh your butt off at messed up people in this movie, from Samir to Michael to Peter to Brian to Drew""o-Face"" to Milton to Lawerence all the way to the King Bill Lumbergh(portrayed by Gary Cole) who is one of the all-time great guys to really hate in a comedy.

It's the type of movie that you usually find something new each time you watch it.  Every character is perfect and well-played by the actors.  Having lesser known actors playing the parts (except for Jennifer Aniston) adds to the appeal. It's a shame not many people even know about,Office Space

You do not even have to work in a cubicle environment to appreciate this film because you can most likely identify with at least ONE of the office characters depicted in this film.  Some of its strong points are intelligent writing, acute observations of everyday life both in and out of work and the soundtrack - although I am not a fan of rap music, this music definitely adds to this film - because it is such a sharp contrast to what's being shown.",Office Space

From there, things just got better. This movie very accurately yet hilariously depicts life in ""the cube"". Initially, we see the extremes of that life, where the top-heavy management are concerned with the most trivial of things, while the employees are sick of their humdrum lives. But when Peter is accidentally hypnotized, into a permanent state of relaxation, just before 2 down-sizing experts arrive at the company to determine who gets laid-off and who gets promoted, the story starts to get very interesting.",Office Space

Having worked in a lot of offices in the past I think it captures the despair of being trapped in a pointless bureaucratic office prison like this full of people with their petty egos in a really funny way. The film moves on from this in an original way and finally ends really well. The characters in this film were so well written and performed that I wish I could watch what happens to them next.Don't come to this film expecting it to blow you away - it's not that kind of film. It's a warm comedy drawn from real life with some stretches to our imagination that are easy to cope with. I think most people will be very fond of this film when they watch it and although it seems to be largely overlooked if it were to appear on TV and you'd seen it and you were about to go to bed I bet most would think 'I'll just watch a bit' and then end up watching the whole thing again.How did I miss this film when it came out?",Office Space

I did chuckle a few times,its an easy going movie and as bad as it was I did still want to see it through to the bitter end. Another movie for Aniston to add to her resume of dross. Glad I don't work in an office if that is the Neanderthal idiots I would have to put up with. It is however on the level of many IT people I know. Absolute rubbish.

284,gah015,The Sleeper Comedy of 1999,9,8 August 2006,"Office Space is a great movie. The comedy is intelligent and the situations are true to life. The film reminds me a lot of Ghostbusters, in that you can tell that there was real creative force behind the jokes in this film. If you've ever had a dead end job you can easily relate to this movie. I remember going to see this movie back in 1999 with some friends and we all thought it was going to be some lame flick (because it had such stupid title), but it was the only thing that wasn't sold out so we gave it a go. Everyone was blown away by this film which turned out to be one of the sleepers of '99. The characters work in cubicles with careers that are (to them) pretty boring, but they have flippant attitudes towards to life and speak like they all are grads of big 10 schools. The boredom of their life can't be made up for by being a weekend warrior, they need genuine happiness.

The main character miraculously stops being hypnotized. It's a shame because the first half of the movie was funny and enjoyable, when it's all about the office life, but as soon as the money stealing thing came on I completely lost interest and just waited for the movie to end. The Jennifer Aniston character is absolutely underdeveloped. The highlight for me was the boss and the office life in general, which was very relatable, even for a 20+ year old movie.",Office Space

If you work in the typical high-stress technology office environment, you'll really want to watch this movie.  It is so right on about the kinds of pressure we technology workers face, the idiocy we deal with at the levels of upper management, and it just makes it all so darn funny!  Every character in this movie has such a wonderfully well-developed, and frequently strange, personality.  I give it 8.5 out of 10.  It loses points only for the selection of music, which was adequate, but not ideal, in my opinion.If you need one more reason to watch this movie, watch it to see what these guys do to the office photocopier machine.  For anyone who's ever had to deal with endless ""Paper Jam"" messages, this is a revenge fantasy come true. :-)",Office Space

The actors' portrayal of each character is seems so sincere. Characters;you will love a few, hate a few. You will empathize with a few and sympathize with a few. Most of us hate our jobs and the way the story runs, it kind of reminds you of your co-workers and of course, your boss. Hell, it at least reminded me of my sad ass job. The characters and the familiar scene of the office environment, is what makes this movie lovable. Some parts are absolutely hilarious and the actors have done a very good job to get that effect.

The characters were well developed and the script was full of hilarious one-liners. What this film lacks is a solid plot. The characters wander aimlessly and the viewer begins to care less and less about them. The film's first half is a well-structured story that seems to be leading somewhere, but drops off after a while.

Without having any of that baggage, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.Ok, this is not the best comedy you'll ever see.  Some jokes do fall flat. But some of the jokes are just full of meaning.  The FAX machine scene is not just a joke, it's a metaphor for ticked off workers who take out their frustrations on an inanimate object.  And I don't think it's about gender, either.  (As one person has said here.)  Any woman who has worked in that kind of environment would know how bad it gets.Which brings me to my point.  Despite this not being high comedy, who else has attacked this issue?  Most movies are wimpy in their depiction of corporate America.  Judge went and mocked the hell out of them.  That fact alone makes me love this movie.",Office Space

Gary Cole as Bill Lumbergh in particular is the epitome of egotistical, unfeeling bosses who carelessly throw their weight around, effecting other people's lives with no consideration or empathy. He's probably your boss, too.Ron Livingston as Peter lacks somewhat in believability -- can sympathize with his feelings but in real life that just doesn't happen (or not in my experience). Although the character is lacking, Livingston is the sort of guy you tend to like.He & his about-to-be chopped coworkers plan a nifty computer glitch that would fill their pockets gradually by adding fractions of every company transaction to a mutual bank account. This, due to a mathematical error, adds hundreds of thousands of dollars to their joint account throwing them into a panic.Samir, played by Ajay Naidu, is very good as a fearful ally. He speaks his misgivings which could reflect the thoughts of many of us.Jennifer Aniston is warm, appealing & inherently brighter than it would appear.This is a good way to spend an evening, get a chuckle, daydream of possibilities -- & hope they get away with it.

296,ConnorMonteith,A well crafted comedy,6,1 June 2011,"""Office Space"" is about 3 regular people who work for a company called ""Initech"". Peter Gibbons, Michael Bolton and Samir Nagheenanajar all hate their jobs. Michael and Samir are software engineers. Peter gets taken to a hypnotherapist, and ends up getting hypnotised, and goes into a state of ecstasy. He ends up ignoring his job and just relaxing. The company hires 2 consultants. Peter gets promoted, while Michael and Samir get fired. They all then plot revenge on the company.The director, Mike Judge, manages to keep the story moving throughout the film. There are no lose ends, and the audience is always kept watching. The story contains many funny scenes, and it fits well with the storyline, which mainly consists of a casual working day.All the characters are described well. At the opening point of the film, we are shown the main characters and their lives. We are shown how they live, and what they are like as a person. This technique works well because it means that we do not have endless questions about the characters. The character of Milton Waddams helps tie the story together whenever there is a lack of action. He also provides a point of interest during the middle section of the film. Milton also keeps us interested at the start and end of the film.I would recommend this film to anyone who likes comedies. The film starts off a bit slow, but as it progresses it picks up pace and becomes a very enjoyable film.",Office Space

For anyone who has had a job in a cubicle or lived or worked in Silicon Valley, Office Space is the penultimate example of suburbia meets workplace lethargy. Ron Livingston is the zombie office worker Peter Gibbons, who works a meaningless job at Initech along with tech gurus Michael Bolton (Herman) cursed by THE Michael Bolton and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu). With bizarre coworkers Milton, a hermit who protects his Swingline Stapler like a city against siege, and Tom Smykowski, Peter, Michael, and Samir live in fiefdom ruled by Bill Lumbergh. Their only escape is late night kung fu movies and the cute waitress at the lunch diner, Joanna, who lives in her own version of hell.

Every line has so much thought put into it, meaning the comedy works on many levels. Some jokes hit you immediately (""Peter, whaaaat's happeninggg?"", the jump-to-conclusions mat), others will not reveal themselves to you until future viewings (""back up in your ass with the resurrection..."", ""the ratio of people to cake is too big..."") Sure, elements of the plot (such as the hypnotherapist part) are a little unlikely, but they work as a device to take our three characters on their journey to escape from the 'cube farm' work environment of Initech.Like ""This is Spinal Tap"", Office Space is one of those cult movies that you just HAVE to see.",Office Space

I'm gonna need to tell you how fantastic this movie is.Office Space is about employee Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) and how he hates his soul-killing job at the software company Initech. Early on in the film Peter and his girlfriend go see a hypnotherapist. While undergoing hypnotherapy Peter is left in a blissful state when his therapist dies in the middle of their session. He refuses to work overtime, plays games at his desk, and unintentionally charms two consultants into putting him on the management fast-track. When Peter's friends learn they're about to be downsized, they hatch a revenge plot against the company inspired by ""Superman III.""Office Space never fails to make me laugh my ass off. I feel like this movie always sort of gets lumped together with stoner comedies, buddy comedies, or fart humor comedies. But it could not be more different than all of them. I think partly we do this because we know Mike Judge so well as Beavis and Butthead, so we sort of connect the dots and think of it in that light, but the movie's humor doesn't come from a bong, a bottle, or a toilet...it comes from real life stress most of us have had to deal with.Its a relational comedy in that we laugh because we know EXACTLY what Peter is dealing with or Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) at the restaurant. Despite technology being a little outdated, its social commentary on management and employees has not changed at all in the last 20 years. This movie is truly unique and spot on in all of its observations. I feel I'm preaching to the choir because this movie is universally loved, but If any one feels different or has a problem with me expressing my love for this movie this is what I'd respond with ""Yeah. You know what, yeah, I do. I do want to express myself, okay. And I don't need 37 pieces of flair to do it. *flips off Stan""Office Space is comedy gold and the most quotable movie ever made.

All in all, great acting, great use of the soundtrack, and superb writing -- that's what makes this movie so great.

307,xjuggernaughtx,A good idea with average execution (Potential Spoilers),6,7 September 2005,"Well, I was really getting into this movie at the beginning. I worked in a corporate office for two years a few years ago, and came to despise it so much that I went back to school and got my degree. Every time I felt like the school load was too much. I would just think about working in that office again. The first third of the film plays to that idea. Everyone in that kind of environment hates their job.Potential Spoilers ahead: Alert!So the parody of the horrible work atmosphere and people with irritating personalities rings true, and it is refreshing when the main character has his revelation. Unfortunately, the movie moves downhill from here. The joke is Peter's carefree attitude and that joke is lost in the second half of the film. Once Peter starts worrying about stuff again, the movie just turns into a bland sub-comedy. Nothing really amusing happens once Peter gets his promotion. The promotion itself serves no purpose. The love interest goes nowhere. Joanna confronts her boss, with no comic affect. It's like this film went from being a dark comedy to a bad drama with the line of demarcation being the crime plot.All in all I feel that this is a movie that feels incomplete. It seems like there are large scenes missing. Or perhaps it was a much smaller movie, and a studio needed it beefed up, feeling that it needed a love interest and a more engaging plot device. In any event, it was a good idea, but it just kind of fizzled. The story lost sight of its own joke and didn't reach its full potential.",Office Space

Forget American Beauty, forget Dilbert comics pinned up on the wall, *this* is the artistic piece about dead-end jobs and the social backlash that comes from them.Office Space speaks to you on a very emotional level. The humour is a sort of light gallows humour, very cynical and hopeless, but inevitably funny. Ron Livingston does an amazing job as Peter, the hapless everyman who, after a hypnosis session gone awry, takes a new tack to the office.If you've ever worked in an office in any capacity, pick up the film and check it out. It is the perfect way of forgetting your cubicle woes.",Office Space

Most office workers can, I would think.That's what gives this movie it's power. It's not meant to be high-brow humor, but it's not toilet comedy either. It's a nice commentary on how bland and yucky the American workscape really is. This movie has so many elements of realism, it's scary. I work with those people, from the inbred, chromosome impaired goofball, to the suspender-wearing, coffee cup (with company logo) toting, only work is to walk around and see everyone else manager, the movie hits everywhere.I've hung out with Indians who work here on transfer visas in the software industry, as well as with the supervisors whose jobs have evolved into interference-runners between customers and programmers.Me, I'm just like the Michael Bolton of the film, but instead of cranking up rap music, I always have a couple of Rage CDs in the car.This movie is a hoot. Every frame is funny. I enjoy it every time I see it.",Office Space
314,claudenorth,"Not bad, but not a classic",6,2 June 2005,"This film is spot-on in its portrayal of the corporate world. However, I found the Jennifer Aniston subplot to be unnecessary and the embezzlement caper to be a bit too farcical and out of sync with the earlier, smarter scenes. It feels rather like a several incomplete scripts stuck together. In general, I felt the script would have benefited from a deeper exploration of corporate culture. Still, I think it's worth a look because its strong points are very strong, and its weak points are benign rather than offensive. I liked the movie, but I didn't love it, and I certainly would not call it a classic, or one of the all-time greatest film comedies.",Office Space
315,englishpete65,Another Gem from Mike Judge.,10,24 November 2013,"There is little Mike Judge does that isn't brilliant and Office Space is no exception. Taking the mundane and frustrating environment of a corporate office and bringing humour to it takes true craft, something Judge has in abundance. The cast is faultless with every character having a genuine warmth and depth to them. Stephen Root is outstanding as Milton Waddams, the put upon office oddball who seems way to attached to his old school stapler. Gary Cole excels as irritating office boss Bill Lumbergh, a role he truly makes his own.John C. McGinley and Paul Willson are brilliant as the two Bobs, a pair of clueless corporate trouble shooters sent to whip the office in to shape/sack people to save the company money and allegedly make it more efficient. In Truth there are scores of cast members in this movie one could single out for special praise due to the rounded depth they give to their characters. In summary, Office Space is a brilliantly cast and scripted comedy. A must see movie for anyone who appreciates film craft at its peak.",Office Space

Sure Mike Judd goes for some cheap laughs but they're laughs that anyone who has worked in an office can immediately recognise. From the socially dysfunctional Milton who is systematically 'eliminated' from the company to the fax machine/copier that just won't work for love nor money this film will have you rolling around on the floor with your sides splitting. I can't believe this film didn't take much at the box office but that says far more about the society this film is mocking than the film itself. In fact I saw this film on British terrestrial television at the criminally late time of 2.30am. Quite what the schedulers were thinking, putting a film of this quality on so late god only knows, perhaps someone had forgotten to attach their cover sheet to their TPS report!! 10 out of 10, highly recommended.",Office Space

This movie is absolute comedic brilliance. not a dull moment. so much subtle humor, and you pick up something new every time!  plus, how can you lose with a jump to conclusions mat!?!  everyone who didn't rate this movie a 10 can go to hell.

It was the third time I've seen it; I needed a good laugh and knew this movie would deliver as always. Is there any film with funnier commentary on office minutae than this one? I think not! This movie elevates slacking off at work to a high art.The real meat and bones of this movie is not that it has a deep plot or grand filmmaking style...that wasn't necessary here. This is just a simple, straightforward comedy that works and works well.The central character, Peter, played by Ron Livingston, is decidedly just not interested in working and has a fun time shrugging off responsibility with a smile. He does what any of us who have ever worked at on office dream of....he simply stops going! I love the scene where he tells Jennifer Aniston's character about this decision. ""I'm just not gonna go anymore."" Hilarious!When Peter meets with the ""two Bobs,"" his blatant honesty about the fact that he NEVER does any work was a gift to proud slackers everywhere!His boss Bill Lumbergh is played with dead-on comedic timing by Gary Cole. I was howling with laughter each time he approached an Initech employee with his trademark managerial opening. ""Hey...what's happening...yeeeah...I'm gonna need for you to go ahead and..."" ""If you could do that, that would be greeeeat."" I once had a boss like this...The birthday cake scene is classic. There is not an ounce of energy in anyone's voices as they sing Happy Birthday to Lumbergh...they look numb and office-dazed. Some other funny points: Milton's constant exasperated mumbling, the whole Chachke's restaurant subplot (15 pieces of flair), and the Hawaiian shirt day announcement.All in all, a guaranteed laugh-fest for office workers, and anyone who is in the mood for a fun, lighthearted movie.8/10 for high laugh value and the fact that the movie never stoops to gross out humor, and never takes itself too seriously!",Office Space

Or even wider, for every IT specialist in the world :) I have watched it for the third time now, and although it didn't make me laugh as loud as for the first time, I still had to keep myself not to fall from the chair :)This is a story about a guy, who is basically sick with his job. One day, during an tragically interrupted therapeutic session, his attitude to life changes drastically. He begins treating everything, that was important to him back at the time, with great ease. He doesn't care about his job, nor his girlfriend. He just wants to do nothing at all and become rich. He plans on inserting a virus into a computer system with his friends and become rich. What follows next is just hilarious, you just have to see it. Every scene is funnier than the next. And it's not that kind of humor that you see in the *too* popular sitcoms. This is a very intellectual, mostly IT related.By the way, I study computer science. When I have seen this movie for the first time, it was no. 1 back then.

The stapler, Mr Lumberg, Case of the mondays, The stapler, the gansta printer beatdown, the arsin, the scam, the plan and the TPS reports are all classic moments in comedy. For this genre i'd definitely say it's a 9/10 (comedies of course being a bit of a crap genre, so the score would be a little lower on a general scale). There are some parts which are not perfect. Jennifer Aniston's character isn't very interesting at all for instance, and there's an overall quite mellow tone, which could've used one or two more explosive moments.",Office Space

To begin with, Ron Livingston delivers a fine performance, as an employee in a boring office job, who like so many other people, finds his job to be redundant and pointless.  His love interest (Jennifer Aniston) also gives a good take on the waitress from the dinner next door.  Listen, I am not going to bore anyone else with my insignificant opinion, however, if you ever have had a job, where you felt so frustrated that it made you want to scream, then watch this hilarious film, and realize the humor that is Mike Judge.-e",Office Space

334,junling1,Story about an non-assertive man and American workplace,6,23 January 2008,"I am disturbed by the message of this movie. Toward the end of the movie, arson and stealing are extolled as a good way for retaliation. I wonder what this movie teaches to our children. The moral message is simply not right.This movie reflects the workplace conflict such as the interference from a boss and his disrespect for the worker. He encroached on their weekend time, he pestered the worker on a small mistake, and he can fire anyone immediately.Our main character is an extremely nice, non-assertive guy. He is simmering inside, toward his bosses, his co-workers, and his girlfriend. When he became much more assertive due to hypnosis, things turn around for him. He assertively cut off his abusive girlfriend, he aggressively asks a woman out, and he refuses his boss's unreasonable demand. All turn out to be well except he carries the simmering anger from his previous life (before hypnosis), and his anger of the company's firing of his co-workers. That led to his scheme of ripping off the company.So the lesson is a simple one: Be assertive. If you don't like something, don't tolerate it. We don't need hypnosis to be brave and go after what we want, or do we?",Office Space
335,paul-2123,An absolute gem,9,25 March 2006,"This is one of those films that slipped under the radar. Witty intelligent with a bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure (Does anyone know what PC Load Letter actually means!) The film starts with the commute from hell, then gets worse with everything that can go wrong actually going wrong.Then he goes to a hypnotist (Mike McShane brilliant - and what a hairpiece!) and gets left in a state of complete relaxation - then all the fun begins.When Peter is summoned before the Bobs I applauded with the classic line ""It's not that I'm lazy - it's just that I don't care"" How I have wanted to say that so many times.The whole film was a shear delight and I will be first in the queue if ever they have a good enough script for a sequel.No film can ever be perfect (hence the 9) but to my mind this is about as close at it will ever get. There are few films I watch again and again - this is one of them.In the words of Bob Lumbergh - Mmm Right !FANTASTIC",Office Space

I know, doesn't sound so funny when reading it but I laugh out loud every time I see that scene.  Anyway, if you can at all relate with the frequent absurdity, tedium, frustration, and degradation that is office work (or any type of ""working for the man"" such as waiting tables at T.G.I Friday's or its equivalent), I guarantee 'Office Space' will make you laugh out loud.

While ""Office Space"" may not be a laugh-out loud hilarious film, which it's not supposed to be, it's defineatly the smartest comedy I've seen in years. Have you ever seen one of those movies where every single aspect of the movie is done exactly perfect? How many do we get a decade? Maybe 2. For the 90s it was ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and this. Maybe ""T2"" and ""The Straight Story."" Watching ""Office Space"" is like watching subtle, smart comedy done absolutely perfectly. It's up there with ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" in its perfect execution. Every single thing about this movie is good. Looking over it, I can find no noticeable flaws. The pace doesn't drag. The acting is top-notch (how Ron Livingston didn't immediately become a major Hollywood star after this is anyone's guess) and the gangsta rap soundtrack surprisingly works. ""Office Space"" is one of the best movies of the past few years, not for what it stands for, but for the simple fact it's just so dang good. ***1/2 out of **** Aw, heck, **** out of ****",Office Space

As in that classic comedy, this movie features a trio of oddballs trying to get ahead in the workplace, and being thwarted by an almost Satanic boss.But where ""9 to 5"" focused on women in the workplace, this movie features geeks in the workplace.  Satirising everything from downsizing efficiency ""experts"" to the restaurants that cater to the office lunch crowd. The movie hits nearly every note perfectly.A couple of jarring flaws mar enjoyment of the movie, at least on home video.  The ending seems awfully tacked on, and the character of Lawrence was horribly under-utilised, but overall this movie makes a great bookend with more serious ""give your life a makeover"" fare as ""American Beauty"".  I think Peter Gibbons and Lester Burnham are unknowing soul mates.Jennifer Aniston did a good job but special kudos has to go to the nearly unrecognizable Stephen Root as the pyromaniacal, but shrewder than anyone knows, character of Milton.  What a comic gem this actor is.  It's hardly fathomable to me that the first time I ever saw him was under a bunch of Klingon drag in an episode of ""The Next Generation"".  This movie and the TV series ""NewsRadio"" really show off his subtle comedic genius.  Also unforgettable is Gary Cole, who submerges himself in yet another role as a supercilious VP, never without his coffee cup, emblazoned with the company logo, of course.For anyone who's ever felt fed up with the ""Dilbert"" cubicle culture, especially those who work in the hi-tech industry, this movie is required viewing.",Office Space
352,kf4wvk,Didn't buy the ending,6,26 March 2006,"Some of the funny scenes often nail the oddities in a corporate software company, much like Dilbert comics. Classic stereotypes are: the annoying voices over the cube walls, other people's music, the guy with the name no one can pronounce, the guy with the same name as someone famous (I never thought about it before, that does seem to happen a lot), and the executive who has no idea how to run the division.As a movie, though, it could have been better. The ending should have been rewritten. The fire came out of nowhere, conveniently solving Peter's problem, and Milton (Stephen Root was excellent), the big time wimp and whiner, ends up on a nice vacation? Peter was supposed to end up on that beach with Joanna. Instead he finds happiness shoveling out the burned construction site? I didn't buy it.",Office Space

The first time I saw it I could identify people I know in real life with at least one of the offbeat and quirky characters in this gem of a comedy.The show-stealers are Gary Cole and Deitrich Bader.  Cole plays Bill Lumbergh, the coffee-swilling ingenuine patronizing boss to Peter Gibbons (Livingston).  Dietrich Bader (Jethro from the 1990's Beverly Hillbillies movie) plays Peter's down-to-earth blue-collar neighbor, Lawrence.  Both come off with superbly hilarious and memorable performances.David Herman does a great job as gangsta rap fan/programmer Michael Bolton (no, not related to that singer guy).The description of the movie on the back of the VHS box doesn't do this film justice.  If you read the box, the movie sounds like just another workplace comedy.  It's not. Office Space has one of the best-developed plots for a comedy movie since ""A Fish Called Wanda"" in my opinion.   The storyline and the characters are credible (especially to those of us who spend 8 hours a day in a cubicle farm), and the laughs are non-stop and tasteful.Mike Judge has created the ultimate office comedy.

Haven't we seen: 1) A computer guy in the news for destroying his company? 2) Layoffs of IT guys in the supposed prime of their careers? 3) People of middle-eastern descent in business-sensitive positions? 4) Cookie-cutter apartments, companies and themed restaurants? I could go on and on. The point is, this movie was and is ahead of it's time. The characters were played excellently by the ensemble cast, and they will be interviewed 20 years into the future for these roles, much as people are still interviewing ""Animal House"" cast members 25 years later.Enjoyable movie. Even if you live in the USA, but have never worked in an office, lived in an apartment, or eaten at a chain restaurant.",Office Space
360,goat1078,Ummm Yeah!,10,9 February 2003,"I love this movie!  It's hilarious!!!!!! I can so relate to Peter's office, like most people can.  I love Gary Cole's Lumbergh character.  The movie is just so real, and so true to office life.  Ron Livingston is great in the role of Peter.  It doesn't hurt that he's also handsome too.  Mike Judge outdid himself with Office Space.  I own the dvd and can & do watch it again and again.  This one is a must-see comedy for everyone.  I just hope Milton gets his stapler back!",Office Space

She was working in an office in a cubicle at the time and I had a dead end job with 8 (at least) managers as well.  We never laughed so hard!  Then when we got a DVD player, it was the 3rd DVD we purchased.  I loaned it to a friend who lost it, so we bought it again. It really is that good.  In a way, I really hope that they DON'T make a sequel, because I am afraid that they would ruin it.  (very minor spoiler) And yes, I DO own a red Swingline stapler.",Office Space

There's also Laurence, Michael Bolton, ANY scene with Lumbergh in it, ""I'm just not going to go any more"", Brian the flair guy, ""I get the feeling she's cheating on me"", the guy selling magazine subscriptons...In short, incredibly funny, quotable, f**king HILARIOUS movie.

365,kingveltheer,How are those TPS reports coming along?,10,13 June 2004,"This movie is simply amazing, one of the best comedies ever. It is like the movie American Beauty except without the same academy award quality and with much more humour and meaner attitude. The soundtrack is unbelievably appropriate with songs like ""Take this Job and Shuv it"". I work at a theater and I can relate to the main character in the movie so it is not a movie for office workers only. anyone who is plagued by stupidity should see the movie. I got the VHS of this when it first came out around 5 years ago and have seen it dozens of times since. The characters in the movie, except for Jennifer Aniston are all small and new.

It was so underwhelming I am forced to warn others late to the game that the humor was unimaginative. Lots of crude humor which I can usually bare with. But it wasn't really funny. I have worked in a cubicle for 30 years and there should have been lots of material to exploit like that portrayed in Dilbert but the scenario were so heavy handed it made it unrelatable. I am not sure why I did, not give it one star, maybe because I was too stupid and watched the whole thing.",Office Space

This movie isn't ""Dodgeball"".And because it isn't any of the above listed comedies I would like to say ""THANK GOD!"" Office Space is one of the best comedies to come out of the 90's. I first saw it when I was 16, all the while comparing it to my crappy job at McDonalds. I've watched it many times since then and rings truer every time. This movie isn't a coming of age/college dorm room/contrived dodgeball story. Instead it plays much more like a warning to all of those who watch it. The warning being that working is more then likely gonna be a major pain in the ass.If you want something that delivers comedy without overacting cartoony characters or over the top sex jokes then may I suggest you check out 'Office Space'. Only then can you add it to your uniform as a valuable ""piece of flair""!",Office Space

It's just as funny the tenth time as it was the first. The stereotypes of office workers are so well characterized. The plot is believable, there are other elements besides comedy that only enhance the comedic elements. My favorite scene is when Peter, Michael & Samir are destroying the evil Fax machine. Who hasn't worked in an office that can't identify with a machine like that? Jennifer Aniston and Ron Livingston, as well as David Herman, Ajay Naidu, Diedrich Bader & Stephen Root all gave a wonderful performance and the chemistry between all of them was fantastic. I think this film is vastly UNDER-rated!!",Office Space

It has a mundane plot that never really gets off the ground. The Rap music track is out of place for this movie. I found the music to be quite offensive with songs that talk about Mother ------, killing, etc. If you skip this movie you won't miss a thing.",Office Space
370,Dio-4,A terrible comedy that's not at all funny,2,14 February 1999,"This movie was extremely disappointing. Although it does have a couple of moments, they are countable, forgettable, and far between. The movie manages to run itself into the ground from the very beginning with running gags done over and over, like the Michael Bolton character, that are merely mildly amusing the first time and tiresome by the end. To some it up in one word, the movie is dumb.",Office Space

I just recently graduated college and am looking for a job.  I think this movie was really funny to me because of the sentiments that all of the main characters feel about their jobs and the daily grind of going to work.  I think anybody ages 18-24 will love this movie especially Ron Livingston's rant about what he would do if he had a million dollars.",Office Space

Every character in this movie is someone everyone knows in their job.  This is a must see movie.  This movie makes you stop and think am I happy in this job, should I ""not go"" to work any more.  The moral of this story is Life is too short to be miserable in a job you hate.  I laughed all through this movie.",Office Space

It's actually quite depressing to think about it at times.I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because Mike Judge masterfully penned the script to capture the essence and drudgery of office life and corporate america in general. From the forgotten worker to the annoying office lady to the foreign contractor , everything about it was just so nuanced",Office Space

Then about a year later, I saw it again and I found it to be better the second time around.  Ron Livingston (You might have seen him in the movie Swingers) plays the role of Peter Gibbons, a programmer who is frustrated with his job along with his co-worker friends.  Jennifer Aniston also appears in the movie, but her role is somewhat minor.  What makes Office Space a fun film in my eyes is the quirky comments some of the characters say like...Peter's Neighbor-""Watch out for your cornhole dude.""Peter Gibbons-""Say Hello to Lumbergh for me!!!""Joanna-""I'm not gonna like steal money out of the register!"" Peter Gibbons-""Well maybe you should!!!""Also, Watch for Mr. 7up Orlando Jones, he has a small role in this movie as well.

378,zhamilton05,Tale of Two Movies,6,15 December 2006,"OK, let me preface this review by stating that the first 45 minutes of ""Office Space"" gave me as many laughs as the opening 45 minutes of almost any other comedy. Particularly hilarious were the two consultants interviewing the Initech staff and Peter's total apathetic meltdown--brilliant! However, the second half of the movie veers so far away from the original intent, that I as a viewer was left wondering who exactly Ron Livingston's character was! That's great in a drama or thriller, but lousy in a comedy.Jennifer Aniston's character is wasted (esp. for the middle third of the movie); apparently Mike Judge wanted a romantic element in his film, but didn't want to spend time developing it. ""Office Space"" disintegrates after the guys lose their jobs and embark on a scheme to steal money from their company. The shift in focus is unsettling and unexpected, and everyone suddenly gets a bad case of the consciences. My guess is that the movie was originally closer to 120 minutes, instead of its final 90 minutes, but that the big wheels did some 11th-hour cutting, reasoning that the audience would grow restless in a two-hour comedy. Generally that's true, but ""Office Space"" would have greatly benefited from a little more character development and a smoother transition to the final 30 minutes. The first half of the movie gets 5 stars out of 5, but the second gets 1 out of 5. 6 stars",Office Space

Wickedly funny!,10,15 August 2007,"Arguably one of the most quotable movies of today's average working stiff's generation. Lumberg and Milton are such classic characters you must be seriously independently wealthy and never worked a day in your life to not be able to identify with a classic movie like Office Space. Thank goodness dudes like Mike Judge exist in Hollywood. I can't imagine a world without a great little flick like this still kicking around. While it would never be considered Oscar type material, I can't help but to think that after all these years, this movie remains among the most tragically over-looked and under appreciated comedies. For no great critical reason other than pure fun factor and pop culture relevance, Office Space remains firmly, a true classic of our time.and Michael Bolton probably hasn't sold a single album since...",Office Space

I work in computer support and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It was refreshing for a film to capture some of my own frustrations in the computer industry and to capture them so well.  I have recommended this film several times and I believe that everyone that works in the computer industry or works in a ""Dilbert""-type cubicle should see this film.Maybe I should try to ""not care"" about work and see just how much longer I will be working.

The funniest of scenes, realistic performances, side-splitters, the movie has every bit of awe in it. It never gets you sleepy and smoothly keeps you in. It isn't extraordinary but its simplicity is likable. Nothing flashy. And the printer scenes were terrific. The perils of office life and the ploy to circumvent the lay off plan have been portrayed in the best of satire. This is what keeps on happening in our daily lives and every employee should definitely watch this for once at least and no matter how many times one does, this is always refreshing and one can identify oneself with the protagonist.10 on 10.",Office Space

If you haven't ever worked in an office you should love this movie and others also love it. The characters are all very funny and memorable. The story centers around Peter Gibbons an office drone who is very fed up with his job, he is very fed up with his 9 bosses pointing out small mistakes, doing the same routine everyday, the annoying coworkers and of course those pointless TPS reports. Peters girlfriend Anne makes him goto an occupational hypnotherapist and after that he starts his dream of doing nothing and he loves it. Peter stops going to work, asks out a waitress he is obsessed with after Anne dumps him and hangs out with his friends more. Then his friends Michael Bolton and Samir get fired and Peter gets promoted. Peter than uses Michael's software virus to steal money from the company they work at called Initech, it messes up and they take way too much money by accident. Now there faced with a huge dilemma and do not know what to do. I recommend this movie to any fans of Mike Judge or just people who want to see a really great comedy.",Office Space
388,anthonydj,One of the funniest movies of all-time,9,26 April 2005,"If you are the type of person who hates your job this is the movie for you. Office Space didn't win any honors or register well in the box office, but it got a lot of laughs and became a cult classic,like The Blues Brothers and The Big Lebowski. It has everything that makes work unbearable. Annoying co-workers, a real jerk of a boss, and that old paper-jamming fax machine. The cast is not ""A-List"" material but Ron Livingston, Gary Cole, Stephen Root carry this movie well together. Livingston plays the employee who just had enough and wants to be freed from the prison that is ""work"". The movie also stars Jennifer Aniston (""Friends"") who plays Livingston's girlfriend. This movie has great work humor that you want to share with your co-workers.",Office Space
389,skmojm,This movie is a horror story about cubicle workers.,9,14 February 2005,"I've been lucky in that I've never had to work in an office, at least not the kind in Office Space. Most of the laughs in this comedy revolve around the endless drudgery and redundancy that goes with working in a place where nothing is actually manufactured, except an endless loop of required clerical tasks. I knew somebody who worked in a Defense plant and he encrypted all his notes into a gobbledygook that only he knew how to decipher. His rationale was, ""If they decide to can me, I take the whole place down..."" There is an element to this kind of thinking in the movie. Ron Livingston is perfect as the main character, since he is just an ""everyman"" caught in this horrible job. An actor with more glamor would have messed up the zeitgeist. Don't miss this one, I just wish that Mike Judge would do more stuff, he has a proved talent for nailing the tempo of the times.",Office Space
390,wakaporter,A Comedy with an important message,8,13 October 2017,"Peter is fed up with working at Intech, because at this computer software firm he and his coworkers are all treated as mechanistic parts of a system where profits and standardization take precedence over humanness. People are given cubicle positions that are repetitive and expendable. The executive management, or the bosses, are ordering people to do their seemingly meaningless jobs with a attitude of feigned affection that is offensively passive. This is most obvious in Lundberg's common phrasing of orders, ""if you could.that would be great,"" which has become an internet meme in recent years probably for how obviously annoying a way of communicating it is. The audience strongly understands and sympathizes with Peter and contempt for work in just the first 15 minutes of the film. Through its satirical yet realistic presentation of white collar office life, this movie has made it into a cult classic comedy. However, the film is not just a comedy, more so it is a commentary on the negative effects a white collar work environment has on its employees. Throughout the film there is an obvious theme of escapism, as the urge to escape life's situation is acute for Peter and several other main characters. Such a theme forces us to investigate worklife within a common capitalist mode of production and why it leaves so many people miserable. The fact that this movie is still a cult classic and that so many people find Office Space relatable, shows that its message is relevant. In conclusion, for making me laugh out loud and think deeper about the effects on individuality of service sector employment, I give this movie a solid 8/10.",Office Space

395,mdcapjr32,Absolutely one of the funniest films ever made,9,26 June 2000,"The first time I saw this, I laughed so hard my stomach hurt. Based on the previews and the fact that it was written and directed by the same man who gave us ""Beavis and Butthead"", I'll admit I wasn't expecting a whole lot. Much to my surprise, Mike Judge acquits himself superbly with an excellent film.""Office Space"" isn't just funny--this a low-budget film that puts on a clinic in great dialogue, character development, solid performances and technical competence. In an era of overblown blockbusters, the fact that this film was made for $9 million makes me respect it even more.As the basics of the plot are evident in the 100+ plus reviews already in this database, I won't delve into that. There are plenty of individual accomplishments worth mentioning, however:
--Gary Cole is outstanding as Bill Lumbergh. The way Cole plays the monotonal, insensitive boss is priceless. He redefines use of the phrases ""what's happening?"" and ""yeaahhh"".--Ron Livingston, a relative unknown, turns in a perfect performance in the lead role of Peter Gibbons. He seamlessly alternates between job-related apathy and GenX schemer.--Jennifer Aniston--not usually one of my favorite actresses--is solid as Joanna, Peter's love interest. She is underused, but the scene where she tells off Chotchkie's manager Stan (played by Mike Judge himself, billed as William King) makes her appearance more than worthwhile.
--Quiz your friends as to the identity of the actor playing the nebbish Milton. Most will never guess that it's Stephen Root, the same guy who played flamboyant radio station owner Jimmy James on TV's ""NewsRadio"".
--Finally, John C. McGinley as Bob Slydell (one-half of the consultant duo brought into downsize Initech) is just too funny. His delivery and facial expressions alone are good for laughs, not even counting his dialogue.I could keep on going--the dream sequences; the gang-style beating suffered by the uncooperative HP printer--and this review would take an hour to read. Two things sum it up for me: first, if you're one of those people who finds yourself randomnly quoting great movie lines with your friends, you'll be doing ""Office Space"" dialogue for a month. Secondly, for a movie that got little press and spent almost no time in theaters, this film has logged well over 2000 votes at IMDb with a very high score. ""Office Space"" has become a cult movie classic for very good reasons--see it as soon as you can.",Office Space
396,pupdrew,A brilliant perspective on cube-land,10,16 October 2003,"While Mike Judge's Office Space has a few awkward moments and an ending that seems forced, there can be no doubt that this is the most spot-on portrayal of life in Cube-land yet produced. If you have never inhabited a cube-farm, some of the humor might fall short, but the rest of us can revel in the perfect rendition of the micro-managing boss, the next-door neighbor caught up in ridiculous details and the water cooler renditions of crass sexual exploits that we all know and hate. ""Office Space"" remains the single most quoted film in our office, from ""I'm gonna need you...to go ahead and come in on Saturday..."" to ""I was told I could listen to the radio from 8:30 to 9:30."" to ""The 'O' face"" to the ""Jump to Conclusions mat."" When our hero is called to the carpet with ""I hear you've been missing a lot of work lately."" and says ""Well, I wouldn't say I've been missing it.""

The sad thing is that after you see this movie you will walk into work and you will see Office Space scenes EVERY WHERE you look. This movie is so accurate it is frightening. Anyone who has spent any time in the corporate environment needs to see this movie, and everyone who sees it will love it.

The humour, however, is still relevant. And its the timeless humour of people hating their job that has made this a bit of a cult classic. Its not an amazing film by any standard, it can be a bit silly at times, but its not a bad film. Its an easy watch when you don't want do take in anything too serious.It is a bit of a shame that Jennifer Anniston is in the film as I tend to associate her with a lot of pretty awful movies.

I can relate to this and I know how the main characters feel as they work in their office environment. For the first 20 minutes of this movie I was laughing non stop. This is probably the funniest movie I have ever seen. I thought the actor that plays the boss was perfect. The script was well crafted and the jokes are pretty clever. Also the Milton character is just great. This isn't a classic but it certainly is a really funny movie I would recommend it to anyone. I would give it an 8 out of 10.,Office Space
406,skerkid9797,this film never gets old,10,28 June 2010,"Office space is a film that I can watch a thousands times in a row, and it never gets old. It's a brilliant movie by a brilliant creator, Mike Judge. This movie may not appeal to all, but the ones it will appeal to will seriously appreciate it. It did horribly when it first came out but it's found a cult audience. Peter is a man that hates his job and life. Everyday it's the same: get up, go to work, go home, watch TV, go to bed. One day his wife wants to take him to a hypnotherapist and he goes along with it. That night every changes for Peter. It changes for the better, and for the worse.I give office space 10 out of 10 because it's hilarious all the way though and it has a great story. You will never get bored during this movie.",Office Space
407,EbrosTheMonk,Frighteningly close to the truth,9,28 May 2003,"I first saw Office Space 3 years ago when I worked for a small independent company.  I enjoyed it immensely then and even more so today.  Here's the reason I enjoy it more: 2 & a half years ago, the owner sold the small business and I ended up getting a job testing software for a mid-sized corporation, cubicle and all.  Scenes from it play over in my head especially during the `all-hands' meetings that get held.  The people this movie is aimed at are the ones whose eyes glaze over during the aforementioned meetings.The things that also make it so funny are the various characters and situations.  For a while I had a very Lumbergh-like boss, right down to the **SPOILERS AHEAD** coffee cup, he even drove the same model Porsche.  I really had to struggle to keep a straight face when he said, `If you could get that done, that'd be great', and like Lumbergh, he said that a lot. And, yes I've had to deal with him when a document I wrote strayed slightly from the required template.  I'm just waiting to hear someone say, `Looks like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.'  The scene with the stubborn printer just happened to me recently.  I came within an inch of putting that thing in the back of my van, taking it to a vacant lot and working it over with a baseball bat. **END OF SPOILERS** The best time to enjoy this flick is after a brutal work week.Anyway, I love this movie because of the cutting way it makes fun of the corporate life as seen through the average guy/gal just trying to survive. And it's not just about the software industry, anyone who has worked in a large organization will be able to relate.  Highly recommended, 9/10 stars!",Office Space

It introduces newcomer Ron Livingston to the movie-going public in a terrific, carefree straight-man role to the stereotypical boss played by Tim Daly and the over-enthusiastic manager of a then-TGI-Fridays-similar restaurant.Stephen Root is hysterical as the ultimate hero of the movie, Milton, but all the supporting cast--- and even the office--- are funny.Supposedly, after the movie came out and piloried TGI Fridays and their over-emphasis on buttons they call ""flair"" the restaurant changed direction and changed their whole image.Jennifer Aniston is great in this movie as well as Peter's girlfriend and this film helped move people away from the perception that she was just a ""Friend.""Mike Judge may have been overly-crude in Beavis and Butthead, too localized in King of the Hill, but he hits a homerun with Office Space-- a comedy anyone who has ever worked in an office can relate to.",Office Space

And then add on to the hilarious office systems, the nerd bosses, the donkey followings, etc. to this cool make-over. And then the whole organization seems to be owned by Peter.

Sure Mike Judd goes for some cheap laughs but they're laughs that anyone who has worked in an office can immediately recognise. From the socially dysfunctional Milton who is systematically 'eliminated' from the company to the fax machine/copier that just won't work for love nor money this film will have you rolling around on the floor with your sides splitting. I can't believe this film didn't take much at the box office but that says far more about the society this film is mocking than the film itself. In fact I saw this film on British terrestrial television at the criminally late time of 2.30am. Quite what the schedulers were thinking, putting a film of this quality on so late god only knows, perhaps someone had forgotten to attach their cover sheet to their TPS report!! 10 out of 10, highly recommended.",Office Space

Office Space's take on cubicle culture is dead-on hilarious, and the actors are all likable (or hate-able) enough, with Gary Cole fully deserving all the praise he's gotten for his supremely odious 'Bill Lumbergh'. But it's hard to ignore that the niceties of plotting seem to have been severely neglected, even allowing for the more lax standards of modern comedy. The romantic subplot involving Livingston and Aniston's characters seems at best tacked-on, which is bad enough, but worse is the inexcusably lame mistaken-identity twist in the last act. And Judge really *should* have used the darker ending too, where Lumbergh lives on...",Office Space
414,torstenscholz87,"Forget about The Office, THIS is the greatest office satire ever!!",9,17 May 2015,"This film once more proves that Mike Judge really is a genius of satire, subversiveness and black humor and capable of much more than just Beavis and Butthead. Starting as a satirical observation of the grotesqueness and triteness of everyday office work, it soon develops into a great farce when the main protagonist falls into a sate of hypnosis and finds a way of escaping his everyday life when he and his co-workers have a not-so-legal plan of making money, but of course, in the end it all fails. But what's much more important than the plot are the great gags about the stupidity of office life and the great characters that are neither too stereotypical nor too much over the top although their trite and pointless life and work makes them all more or less mad, but that's just what happens when you do stupid office work for years. In a nutshell, it's one of the greatest and most underrated comedy films of all time and everyone who does a job he hates himself will relate to it.",Office Space
415,amscloudnine,Absolutely Brilliant and Funny,10,23 March 2015,"Mike Judge carves out a rare depiction of life in the IT world. It's not something the Hollywood writers seem to know or write about. He has lived it and knows it quite well. The script, the characters, the plot, the depiction of life in the modern IT world all fit in perfectly. This movie broke a lot of ground that has later been copied or slightly differed. If you like shows like ""The Office"" and ""IT World"", you will thoroughly enjoy this.I remember during the financial crash of 2K, I was in an IT shop then. Just before they closed down the entire division, we should this movie against a white wall in our cubicle area. Even the upper level managers there laughed. We were at first a little nervous about showing it but hey, we were all being layed off and replaced by cheaper off-shore labor anyways.

416,FranBB,One of the greatest films ever,10,11 July 2005,"'Office Space' is, without question, one of the greatest films ever made. Forget using big name stars, multi-million special effects etc. For script and characterisation alone, this is pure genius. This film goes back to the fundamentals of what makes good drama; something which is so often overlooked these days in favour of CGI and FX.One of the characters grammatical mistakes are made fun out of, without ever been offensive. This is just one example how the film has been masterly handled. This movie speaks volumes about how people feel working in a job that are unhappy in. It is part social commentary, part philosophical enquiry. It is an accurate portryal and description of how thousands, if not millions, of people feel everyday in our work-obsessed, capitalist, profit-orientated society. It captures hilariously the isolation, alienation and estrangement that people are made to feel in their adult, working lives. It also captures the mentality of our generation.To me, what makes this film so good is the fact that it is like 'Catch-22.' On the face of this film, its a comedy with amusing situations. But if one were to look deeper and more closely, you would also realise that it is deadly serious. It makes you reflect on your own life (I wouldn't be surprised if people left their jobs after watching this film). Watch it and never be the same again.",Office Space

Finally, they meet that Bane of office life, the consultants, who change the company and in so doing change the lives of all the cast. Let the laughs mount up!No doubt the office is fertile ground for comedy, it is where most of us spend our working lives. We can relate, we all know a Milton or any number of characters represented and have had similar conversations or encounters. Office Space should be funny and it was when I didn't work in an office and had an idealised view of what such work would involve, it was supposed to be slow unaware death. Office Space was my opportunity to laugh at my fate and those already on the slide. It could simply be I like my office job and no longer share the writer's view but it is also possible that as I have grown up so too has comedy, cynicism and sarcasm have been replaced with a more sophisticated irony and satire, think The Office.

It's cruel, it's real, and it's funny precisely because we can be starring everyday when we go to work. When I saw the film, the next day I went to office I recommended it to everyone who was working (my level, not my multiple bosses, of course).

429,RPBongo,The Basic Comedy of the Late 90's Although This One Features a Very Well Done Performance,4,16 January 2000,"I have noticed, as I am sure many of you other users out there have noticed as well, that pretty much every ""comedy"" that has come out the last 5 years or so are pretty much the same.  Of course there are about a dozen or so exceptions but the majority of these films feature the protagonist getting in a horrible situation dealing with either money, sex, violence, or in many cases, all three at once.  Well Mike Judge's ""Office Space"" is your basic 90's comedy, although somewhere in this film there is a performance that not only stands above the rest, but in the majority of comedy's that have been released recently.The film starts out with Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston. giving a performance that belongs more in a sitcom then in a film) driving through a traffic jam on his way to Initech, a place he absolutely hates to work at. When he reaches his office, the viewer gets to meet the various co-workers that either are friends of Peters (Michael Bolton/David Herman, Samir/Ajay Naidu), enemies (Bill Lumbergh/Gary Cole) or people who are just ""there"" (Milton Waddams/Stephen Root).  After a relatively funny opening, the film goes downhill.  After a hypnotheraphy session, Peter realizes that there is no reason to be stressed, and basically blows off work.  This leads to a montage that finds Peter antagonizing his boss (Gary Cole, in a role that seems very shallow, but is pulled off amazingly well given the little bit of development behind his character) and shacking up with Chtochkie's waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston doing her worst acting to date)  But when Peter decides to cross the line and use a complex scheme to steal money from Initech, that's when the downfall begins.Now the people I was watching this video rental with found it hilariously funny, but I on the other hand didn't.  Of course there were some relatively funny scenes and jokes (i.e. the opening scene with Michael Bolton listening to gangsta rap in his car, the Chtochkie's waiter Brian, a majority of Lumbergh's lines (especially during Peter's dream sequence), but ""Office Space"" nowhere near the non-stop laughter I got from watching ""South Park:Bigger, Longer, and Uncut or even ""Black Samurai"".

I also related to this movie because I worked in a cubicle for years, often cursed the faulty fax & copy machines, and found the office environment full of banal rituals and insincere co-workers. You'd think a movie that denegrates our daily workday would be depressing, but instead it is hilarious.  It's funny because it's true.  This movie takes all the little things that we dislike about our workplace and magnifies them.  From the merciless commute to the annoying co-workers to the fear of lay-offs this movie takes it all to the n'th degree.  The plot is full of gangsta rap music that creates a perfect contrast to the ""company man"" image most of us put on every day.  The characters are genuine and I found myself thinking that each one reminded me of someone I actually work with. This is not a coup-de-grace of cinematography or an academy award winner.

Mikes Judge really does a very good job with the cast(especially wit Gary Cole who does an EXCELLENT job),and the way he managed to develop the original Milton story to create a film which almost every person, who has at least a vague idea of what an office consists of ,(90% of the developed world works this way!!) seems to identify with.This film cant be missed!!As Gibbons makes reference to..HUMANS Weren't MEANT TO LIVE THIS WAY!!!..Some people found Aniston's role, especially when the DVD came up, as a mere marketing feature and it may be true BUT...just to say that her role is very interesting since i found it basic for the story because she actually represents the other side of the life...the good side, she is pretty and very LOVABLE and helps the film when it comes to making a contrast with the down parts of working in such a grey atmosphere as the office one.I JUST LOVE THIS FILM AND I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT, PLEASE PEOPLE PLEASE, Don't READ THIS AS A COMMENT FROM ANOTHER DISTANT GUY WHO SEEMED TO BE PLEASED WITH THE FILM,,,, IF YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SOME TRUE MEANINGS OF LIFE WELL HERE ARE SOME OF THEM...GIRLSSS GOOOOD, ZERO-Responsibility JOB GOOOOD, WORK IN OFFICE NOOOO GOOOD!! HAHAHA THAT IS REALITY,,,,MONEY IS MONEY...BUT SIMPLE LIFE, NORMAL JOB, NORMAL GOOD-SMELLING HOME WITH HOT CHICK IS WORTH TRYING BEFORE WORKING 40 YEARS AT AN OFFICE.",Office Space
447,mondocasa,Bad and Not Funny,2,27 May 2007,"Mike Judge or not, this movie is just plain not funny. I laughed exactly once - at the guy in the wheelchair who says that if you wait long enough good things come to you.It's not a particularly good send-up of office life, although I'll give it a point for ""Somebody's got a case of the Mondays"". The characters are wooden and deliver lines like, well, like the guys in Mike Judge's cartoons, other than Beavis and Butthead.I've noticed over time that this movie has a base of support among younger adults. I can't figure out why.And Jennifer Aniston doesn't even look that good.",Office Space

Personally, I would recommend this movie to anyone, however be warned that you must just sit back and relax when you watch it; it isn't the most meaningful movie ever... But it is definitely one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time, next to Evil Dead 3, & Army of Darkness; of course.  Its funny, Its crude(not too crude though), Its a masterpiece: definitely a masterpiece.",Office Space

It is nice because it doesn't even resort to trashy humor, which can be very funny, but doesn't have the lasting impact.  The characters are brilliant, especially the boss.  It is funny that the main character is really very plain, but his actions make all the madness and hilarity happen.",Office Space
450,abigjuicyvan,"If this movie replaced the bible, the vatican would be disneyland.",10,31 May 2002,"Based on a cartoon first aired by the genieuses at Studio 8H, Office Space was a cartoon written by Mike Judge as we all know.  I do not work in an office such as the one depicted in the movie, but my own comedic instincts were rattled by the office mockery that Office Space provides.  This movie mocks everything from the asshole boss with his coffee mug with ah...the companies name on it- to the birthday celebrations that all employees are forced to go to.  It puts on screen what everyone feels inside about work. When Bill Lombourge announces a hawaiin shirt day you as an employee of some big industrious company doing a tedious job such as computer programming, you will appreciate the pain, and insult that you feel at work during a birthday celebration and the hatred you have for the patronizing boss. This movie also gives people an insite to what little comraderie really exists at work, the paranoid man who thinks he is losing his job, the weirdo that's neglected by the whole office, and the bullshiters or consultants played by John C. McGinley and a fat D movie star who you can probably find if you peruse old HBO friday night movies.Judge represents the workforce extremely well and proves again that he is a great comedy mind.  Peter does what we all want to do: Leave our responsibilities behind, go fishing with ABC's Deidrech Bader, rip off the evil heels at work, and hang out with Jennifer Aniston which reminds me that this movies jesting about the attitude, happy birthday song, restaurants like Friday's and Al E. Gater's is worth your time....",Office Space

The trouble is, I find myself doing the ""Lumbeurgh"" impersonation everywhere; my wife is about ready to harm her brother for ever getting this for me. If you've ever had a CEO that's totally condescending to everything you do, or if you've ever worked in a cubicle or fast food, then this movie is for you. Like another reviewer, I am not a fan of rap ""music,"" either, though, so if you can get around that awful stuff, then this is a total score at the video store. So, that said, if you'd just go ahead and...post this comment for me, that'd be terrific. Thanks a lot, IMDb...",Office Space

But then, I gave it a end go w/o the distraction of my Kindle & all the many funs it has on it. Now, that I have given it the fair chance, I can say that I do get it...get the ""unappreciated world of office workers"". While I don't work in the cubicle world (I guess maybe her office, her office, & mine...does kinda mean I do lol) I can SO relate to the under-appreciated ways of the office, the copy machine that just never wants to work, & the crazy demands of the bosses that don't do anything, but flaunt their ""I don't have to do anything"" benefits. Can totally agree that wanting out & never having to work again...a dream!!",Office Space
453,Qutmaster,Second best movie ever made,10,30 December 2009,I first saw this movie when it came out a decade ago. A few years back I decided to see it again because I wanted to see the whigger-scene and the beat up again. 7 years older and with a little more experience of life – life in a cubicle that is – I realized that this must be the second best movie ever made. If someone calls it THE best movie ever made I won't argue - people is allowed to have different opinions on things like this. I no longer work in a cubicle and I hope I never will do it again. Ever! And this movie is a reason for this. I more or less owe it my life. So thank you Mike Judge for one of the best script ever written. Every scene is nuthing but on point!,Office Space

455,nhutchind,Great Dilbert-esquire comedy!,10,3 December 2005,"I won't say much, other than this is one of the funniest movies you will ever watch if you work or have ever worked in an office. I feel that it resembles the comic strip of Dilbert somewhat, too, which may be another reason that it's funny. Some resemblances include Peter as Dilbert, Michael as Wally, Samir as Asok, and Lumbergh as the pointy haired boss.The only potential bad thing that I see in this film, is that managers who don't want to be like Lumbergh but don't see how they can't, may get depressed (my best friend felt worried about whether his management style would ever evolve into Lumbergh/point haired boss syndrome).Anyway, go rent or buy this movie. It's just awesome.",Office Space
456,crafterdot,Better With Every Viewing,10,28 December 2010,"I have seen this movie 5 times. Somehow I'm not sick of it. In fact I like it better each time. It's the kind of movie I watch once a year. There are some classic scenes like when Peter and his co-workers steal the fax machine and smash it while some weird techno-rap music is playing. I also love the whole ""Michael Bolton"" gag that comes up a bunch of times. There are probably a dozen classic scenes in this movie. I also like that Jennifer Aniston is in it. She was a huge TV star at the time and didn't have to do a ""small"" movie like this one but she lent her name to the project which probably helped get the movie made. Check this film out. For me it's a 10 out of 10.",Office Space
457,bmills313,Pure genius,10,4 June 2003,"I first saw this movie while in college and thought that it was an entertaining and truly hilarious movie. Then, after graduating I went to work for a short time at a company very much like Initech and experienced the daily grind that this movie places you in and after being a part of the ""Initech-world"" I had an even greater respect for this movie! Mike Judge is brilliant in a Christopher Guest's Spinal Tap or Best in Show way: dry humor based 100% on real life circumstances. The reality created is so believable that you laugh at things not because they are funny, but because they are so REAL and can/do happen to so many of us on a daily basis. If you want to see a superb comedy about what real life is like in the working world of the middle-managed corporate America, look no further.  If you work in an office that has middle-management and you're sick of TPS reports, multiple bosses and jamming fax machines, buy this movie right now!! This movie will have you in stitches simply because you experience at least some part of the movie on a daily basis. I find myself watching this movie more times than I'd care to admit, and it never gets old...8^) Excellent work by both Mike Judge and the perfectly selected cast.",Office Space
458,ricardo0-80-220403,Duped by the high rating - Rubbish!,1,13 June 2011,"Gave this movie a go because of it's high rating but oho, what a waste of time. Facile and childish humour, bad pacing and virtually no plot. The characterisations are shallow with Mr Judge appearing to focus on making his actors hold cartoon-like faces at every opportunity. Perhaps this movie appealed to the teenage market or those with a limited attention span - the ending was certainly telegraphed in the first half-hour.The boring drudgery of working in an office could have been explored so much more and with much more wit.My wife was not at all happy that I was the one who suggested we watch this tripe. Don't waste your time - honestly!!!",Office Space

460,astemborski,Excellent Movie,10,2 July 2004,"A film that explains why you should start your own business. It shows how the corporate world can sometimes operate: cold and empty. Extremely well written scripts and memorable characters. Call in sick and watch this movie.Then quit your day job and become self-employed.I have not met a single person that didn't enjoy this movie. Actually let me take that back. There were a few people that didn't care about the movie that much and thought it was okay. Then afterward, they went back to their cubicle where they were acting busy filling out forms that accounted for the bathroom breaks they took that day.",Office Space

The acting and situations are true to life, ultimately reflecting what we all really want to do if we had the guts.The flick is filled with tedious situations with which one deals on a daily basis when working in an office (or any work setting for that matter). We've all had that over the top perky co-worker irritating your already wretched office life or the gloomy, petty pain in the neck boss and gadgets you depend on to get your work done that NEVER work, and finally those atypical heroes with whom you can relate that save the day.Whoever wrote the script definitely worked in an office setting- or a restaurant chain! Great comedy.",Office Space
462,little_daddy979,More than just a comedy...,10,24 September 2004,"This cult classic is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Many people mistake it for being just a comedy that used an original setting and plot very effectively. I found the movie to teach very important lessons too. It taught me not to waste my life doing crap like working in a cubicle. The use of rap music was phenomenal as a sharp contrast to the dull office life. I believe that even though the movie wasn't noticeably crowded with rap, that it would have been a totally different movie without it. Although the movie doesn't have an overabundance of great comedic moments like Airplane!, other elements of the movie make up for it to give it 10 out of 10",Office Space
463,JohnnyNitro,Watch Office Space if you have trouble sleeping,1,4 November 2004,"Right from the get-go, Office Space feels, appears, and has just this indescribable atmosphere about it that just makes it unbearably boring. Maybe its the very weak and shallow characters, the boring environments that every scene takes place in, or the extremely weak and lame attempts at humor that make this movie feel like you've just smashed your head against a brick wall 400 times over after watching it.Or maybe its the fact that, as my friend pointed out to me whilst we were watching it, it is directed by Mike Judge. The same Mike Judge who also created King Of The Hill. The only thing that this movie does successfully is port over the same trivial, lame, incredibly drawn out and mind-shatteringly dull 'humor' from the King Of The Hill cartoon and label it as some sort of office/big corporation parody. At least Judge can do something right.Although, because of this, the movie does serve several purposes. I would suggest it as an example to anyone who wants to know how not to make a comedy. It is good for making you appreciate that your life is not as incredibly boring as the computer programmers and other characters in Office Space. And the only other good thing I can think of about Office Space is to recommend it to insomniacs, as, much like King Of The Hill, Office Space will put you to sleep in no time.Office Space provides little if any laughs, or even smiles (except at the jokes that fall embarrassingly flat every time), and it boggles the mind as to why this movie is labeled as a comedy, or even entertainment for that matter. The humor is dull, and down-right irritating most of the time. Overall, Office Space just feels like a really really really really.........really really really long, drawn-out sketch from a comedy-skit show that nobody would laugh at anyway. (watch Anchorman if you don't know what I'm talking about.)Like i mentioned above, watch this movie if you need a good-nights sleep. Or you could just stare at a blank wall until you fall of your chair and onto the ground out of boredom. Both provide similar results.",Office Space

Me and friends haven't figured out where the Apartments are...anyone have a clue? We thought they might have been in South Austin, like Congress area. We were also wondering what other Austinites love this flick? It was great seeing a lot of old Austin pre 01 invasion. The Lamar shots were great, and anyone have an idea where the cleanup site was based? This is just one of those quirky movies like Revenge of the Nerds that you either saw in the theater, or you drank and smoked some stuff just laughing your as s off.

It doesn't matter what your job has been, the office environment itself is just so boring and you can get a lot out from this movie. ;-) The characters are great, humor is smart and at least I could relate to any of those office ""nerds"". ;-) This is a very enjoyable movie and I truly recommend it! This movie is realistic (enough), funny and tells the truth about working in an office. I have had many similar experiences as in the movie so that made the movie even funnier.

I've been working in high-tech software companies for many years, so the characters really come to life for me. This movie's executives, coworkers, consultants, friends and the overall scenario is truly art imitating life.Ron Livingston is a great average Joe, working stiff. He's funny and a regular likable guy. His antics with his coworkers Michael Bolton and Samir Nagheenanajar(David Herman and Ajay Naidu, respectively) are fun to watch.Jennifer Aniston is a major plus for any movie. She's always likable in real people roles and is easy on the retinas. Gary Cole was just too convincing in his role as the executive. He is the epitome of the Peter principle.The supporting cast members are very important to the overall feel of the movie. They did a great job of making me forget that Initech wasn't a real NYSE traded company. The theme is so realistic that in some spots it's scary (in an entertaining way). The language isn't suited for kids, but I don't watch it with the kids. Anyway, the whole cast was excellent! Mike Judge did a great job with the plot and sub-plots!Overall it was very well done! It's a modern-day ""take this job and shove it""! Bravo, Mike Judge! Bought the DVD and watch it regularly for ""stress relief"".",Office Space

I think the movie will appeal to anyone who currently works in an office setting, for a large corporation.

Multitudes of bosses telling me when one little task was done wrong, as though I were an incompetent peon and they were gods. Mike Judge did a wonderful job portraying the stupidity of the corporate environment quite well, and I was laughing at the fact that I used to be there.The story is well written, with a lot of funny dialog. A bit predictable at many points, but with a comedy about something someone used to be a part of, that is to be expected. The characters are quite believable, and you even feel sorry at points for a few. Judge creates a thorough denoument here, allowing running jokes to rest and open wounds to heal.All in all, I would definitely want to see this movie again. It's a release, and a great way to reflect back on the Dilbert-inherit society America has adopted.",Office Space

I was glad it turned out to be the former.  Each of the characters exhibit some of the characteristics of cubicle life (I've seen it firsthand).  They are the real centerpiece of this movie as opposed to the hijinks.  I thought the ending was a bit lacking but it's not that big of a deal as it is what leads to the end that's so fun.  You will leave this film talking about the many similarities to your real life that you find in the film.

Of course, the appeal for a lot of people will probably be the ""hey, I've done that!"" syndrome (see ""Clerks""), but if you can look past that, the film makes some astute observations on life.  In an era where work satisfaction is supposedly high on everyone's list, a lot of us still hate our jobs - so why do we keep working them?  In the movie, Peter Gibbons makes this realization, and instead of running away from ever holding a job again or turning to a life of crime, he works through it and figures out that it *is* possible to have a job you don't dread going to every morning.",Office Space

It seems that many have tried but only fail to follow the leader of this script type since the days of Cameron Crowe's epic; ""Fast Times."" But finally another writer has done it. It just so happens to be another cultural observer by the name of Mike Judge. Judge has been successful before in the making of the two idiot cartoon boys, Beavis and Butthead and Nincompoop family and friends of King of the HIll.  Judge who also directed and wrote the big screen version of Beavis and Butthead captured his wit and charm with real characters much greater than you would expect him to have here in Office Space.  Based on the short cartoon that Judge created, Milton, Office Space takes place in (go figure) an office environment that almost every American hard working person can identify with.  I felt when I left the theater that I knew every person in that movie as a person I know in real life.  It was as if Judge wrote you in the movie too.  A brilliant effort from the first time film Director, Mike Judge.  I laughed hysterically from the start to the finish of this comedic film.  I entered the theater negatively with my doubts and left with a found respect for Mike Judge. The character development was never lacking as I expected it too.  The script was meticulous and delivered well through a cast of praiseworthy actors.  My favorite being the Gary Cole ... Bill Lumbergh character. An honorable Oscar award to Stephen Root's ... Milton Waddams character, as he kept me in stitches throughout. I don't want to give away the plot and outcome of this movie, I just should say that you'll get a kick in the ass if you loved Fast Times by going to see this comedy masterpiece.

It is just hilarious, there are so many classic lines and gags, my work mates and I are still quoting the movie in our day to day business months after having seen the movie.

That is important too, right!!!???? This is one funny movie!!The great thing is, this movie allows you to vicariously do the things you would really LOVE to do in life but CAN'T: ""Disobey"" your AS*HOLE boss and NOT come in on the weekend, IGNORE his 50,000 subsequent phone calls asking where you are, wear flip flops and shorts to the office, SMASH that awful constantly malfunctioning cheap-a$s all in one piece of sh!t copier/printer/fax, hit (pun intended) the company where it hurts (the wallet), etc. You will want to watch it again and again just to laugh along with (and at) the CHARACTERS. This movie will keep you laughing and you will have a great time if you can get past the fact that this movie goes nowhere. If you have ever worked in an office, this movie will resonate well with you. Almost too well, it's kind of sad. OK I'm over it, because I am thinking of all of the funny parts in this movie!!! That pompous jerk for a boss that you have, the spineless weirdo mumbler guy, the annoying voice lady, the bosses who pounce on you multiple times for the same TINY little mistake, etc.Ummm yeah if you could just go ahead and see this movie that would be great, OK? Thanks. I'll be sure to get you another copy of that memo...I could go on and on. But I'm not going to. Just go see it, already!!! Just laugh and remember not to take yourself or the movie too seriously!!!",Office Space

Peter Gibbons says everything you wish you could have said and does everything you thought of doing.Everone has worked for a Bill Lumbergh at some point in their lives. You will find yourself wandering around the house with a coffee cup in your hand repeating the infectious ""uh, ya"" (watch for this in the movie).And everyone's had to endure working with a Milton, too. Just don't touch his stapler or move his desk and you will be just fine.Although you may think Jennifer Aniston would be the big star in this movie, Ron Livingston shines as I-can't-take-this-job-anymore Peter.Watch it a couple of times.

The movie is a humorous look into the life of Software Engineers at an evil corporation, Initech. Having been into a similar office and having many friends that are in a similar situation, the movie seems to exemplify everything that is ridiculous in its situation. The protagonist can be very easily identified with, because he is a man that just does not like his job. Plus, he has 8 horrible bosses.

Ron Livingston is an absolute beast, while he plays the part perfectly. From start to finish, the movie keeps your attention, while there is not a boring moment. Also, this movie brings out aspects of real life that one can relate to, a sure fire tactic for entertainment. The sealer on this movie is Milton's character, which is always unpredictable and so much fun.

This is a special movie and I would say people please watch it because somewhere in this movie, you will find yourself relating to the characters.

It's because of the very dry, silly humour. So then you'll find a Mike Judge movie hilarious or annoying. Because of the grossly dry, grossly silly humor.As far as that's concerned, it's not so bad with Office Space. That's why, unlike B&B, you can walk the golden mean here. An advantage is that you once worked at the office, which makes it a bit easier to handle.There's no lack of great acting and one-liners here; especially Gary Cole as boss Bill Lumbergh keeps on surprising with his seemingly effortless yuppie/businessman schtick. The soundtrack is also very aptly chosen; it hangs between fifties swing and gangsta rap. A bit strange, but somehow quite apt.Unfortunately, the film can't quite follow the acting; towards the end, humour comes second and people are mainly trying to make ends meet.Nevertheless, there is still a lot of beautiful comedy left over.

I work with wackos too, and most of the upper management are idiots who have no idea what goes on in the store. But I do have a nice boss, so I shouldn't bitch. This movie is a brilliant look at day to day life in the average Americans working day. I only wish I had the balls that peter does!

The product is called Symitar (new branding now yields 'Episys') which is a Jack Henry & Associates Company. A trusted coworker who once worked for the company explained it all to me.

He ends up trying to hard and he finally ends up getting a promotion. The rest you will have to see for yourself. In my opinion, I thought this movie ruled. I liked the storyline and the people who play the roles are good actors. Ron Livingston is a good actor and plays an excellent role as a person who hates there job. In the end, this movie turned out great and I recommend to anyone who has not seen this to hurry up and buy it or rent it because I guaranteed you will love this movie.",Office Space

Everyone has worked with a Brian or a Milton, and everyone has had a boss like Joanna's boss or Bill Lumburgh. I laughed crazily throughout this whole movie, but I have to say my favorite scene was ""killing the copier"". The way the author managed to zero-in on every annoying aspect of the work place: (the door knob that always shocks you), your coworkers (""Somebody's got a case of the Mondays""), and your boss (""I'll have to go ahead and ask you to come in on Saturday""), amazed me.

Mike Judge(Director,actor) is a comedic genius and he shows it in this movie. Ron Livingston and Jennifer Anniston surprised me by totally nailing their roles. This movie is just funny on so many levels and appeals to the young and old. I think one of the signs of a great comedy is that when you watch it, you will notice that lots of sayings used commonly in pop culture originated from it. This is definitely the case with Office Space. So if you want to laugh for the longterm, watch this movie!",Office Space

This work has been brilliantly put together, and if you can't see a little bit of yourself and those that work around you, in it, then you must be asleep.  Don't be concerned about comments that suggest the acting isn't up to scratch, as it is just excellent.  Mike Judge achieved what he set out to with this one, as the characters are loaded with realism.  Have you ever seen an office that isn't full of boring people? Fortunately we have a cast and director that are able to bring the movie to life and spice it with wit and humour that will have you laughing out loud from the opening scene.  I love the way we see the many character traits that make us different and stand us out as being individuals, like we each react so differently behind the wheel of a car.  The dialogue is superb with more being picked up every time you watch the movie.  I am currently almost half way through a post graduate degree in Leadership and Management and this movie would have to be better than any text book I have come across yet.  If you haven't seen it yet, just get yourself a tall drink and some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy an entertaining experience.  If you have already seen it, get it out again and enjoy it even more.

Well since then I've seen it probably 3 or 4 times and each time it is better than the last because you notice something new or another dimension of a joke they make.  The way that office life is portrayed makes for a hilarious movie and a good investment of a couple hours.I recommend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humor, and I doubly recommend this movie to anyone who has only seen it once and was not all that impressed.

511,edthecrackhead,Let me explain why this movie is great.....huge insight!,10,24 June 2002,"First off, most people just say this is some silly movie that has to do with disgruntled office people who are bored with their lives and want to do something that makes them happy. But it has nothing to do with that at all. The movie is all about not wanting to do anything. Period. If I were to win a lottery I would just sit around my house all day, watch television, play video games, watch sports, eat whatever I wanted, and sleep whenever I wanted. I could do that because I had enough money to support that. Why would I do that? Because it's the easiest way to live life. To do nothing is a dream to a lot of people and let me tell you the people who actually 'get' the movie have that dream. I've let people borrow this movie saying it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but I never really knew why some people didn't like it. Then I looked at the personalities of the people who don't like it. First there is my parents who are in their mid-40s and are work-a-holics that need to be busy to be 'productive'. Then I look at other friends. Those people are the type that will constantly work out to better themselves, volunteer because they want to, and constantly bettering their surroundings. I and the people who understand the movie just do enough to get by without being hassled in life and just basically could sit on a couch my entire lifespan and lead a happy life. That's the way it goes. So before you really rate this movie, think about who you are. If you are a person who makes sure their house is clean before people come over, don't rate the movie at all. If you would love to just take a day to watch tv and eat ice cream, give it a shot.PEACE!Mitch",Office Space

516,luisfromla,Great movie! Must watch!,8,18 June 2012,"Office Space is a comedy made in 1999 and is commonly known as a spoof of the typical 1990s software company office life. The film is written and directed by Mike Judge, who has made films such as Idiocracy and Extract. He's also very well known for creating the Beavis and Butthead series. It was distributed by the 20th Century Fox Company, which helped market and give it credibility. Since the movie has come out, it has gained somewhat of a cult following from many movie geeks and regular office workers because of the mockery the film makes of modern world jobs. The fun frenzy film is a stamp on today's cinema and work life. The main character in the film is Peter Gibbons (Played by Ron Livingston), who is a depressed office worker who hates his job. The leading female role is Joanna (Played by Jennifer Aniston), who works at a family restaurant, and later becomes Peter's girlfriend. Gary Cole plays Bill Lunbergh, Peter's annoying boss. Peter's friend Samir and Michael also play big roles in the movie. There is no confirmed setting mentioned at any part of the film, but it looks to be set in a warm western state (California, Arizona, Texas, etc.).In the Initech office, the insecure Peter Gibbons hates his job and the boss Bill Lunbergh that has just hired two consultants to downsize the company. His best friends are the software engineers Michael Bolton and Samir Nagheenanajar that also hate Initech, and his next door neighbor Lawrence. On top of that, his girlfriend Anne is cheating on him but she convinces Peter to visit the hypnotherapist, Dr. Swanson. Peter tells how miserable his life is and Dr. Swanson hypnotizes him and he goes into a state of ecstasy. Confident Peter then decides to date the waitress Joanna and changes his attitude in the company, being promoted by the consultants. When he discovers that Michael and Samir will be fired, they decide to plant a virus in the account system to embezzle fraction of cents in each financial operation into Peter's account. However Michael commits a mistake in the software and instead of decimals, they steal a large amount. Shocked and terrified by the mistake, the desperate and unlucky trio tries to resolve the problem or they will go to prison.There is no true theme to the film that can obviously be recognized, but the film just seems to be a goofy comedy about a few office workers doing some stuff that many office workers would love to do to their jobs. Office Space has gained a large following because of the actions of the characters in the movie, and the desire that real people have to follow in their footsteps. Even the most boring office worker is envious of the characters in the film because of their fearless acts that you can't help but respect and laugh at, at the same time. As stated in the last paragraph, this movie does apply to life in a way. It's based in the real world and stars real people. But the actions that the characters take are almost out of question for the average office worker. In the movie, Michael releases a virus into the company's system, and ends up completely ruining the way the company handles money. If one were to really think about it, this movie is extremely fictional. If what these characters did happened in real life, they would be in some very very big trouble. I thought the film was an amazing movie. In a few years I'm sure it can be remembered as a classic. It has become a must-see film for anyone working in an office today. Easily one of the most iconic movies of this age, it's the movie that characterizes what every office worker just wishes they could do. Pulling off a huge corruption scheme, making money off of it, never having to work again; sounds like the life. I'd recommend people of all ages to see the movie at some point in their lives, especially since it's based in and office and many people often work in offices eventually. It is a must watch.",Office Space

One of my favorite comedies, and sort of a source of medicine for the pains of working in an office with complete idiots. Anyone who's ever worked in a corporate office can relate to this film on some level, and can probably swear that they know someone exactly like one of the characters depicted here. Mike Judge really captures the aspect that makes office life so miserable, which is without a doubt the characters that you must deal with that your personal life would normally exclude. There is no question that he must've had his own bout with the way of the office bitch, as he shows that he knows it all too well. Out of the comedies I've seen, I can most identify with this one.Kudos to the casting department for putting together a unique group of people to portray the perfect characters for the story. all a true treat to watch and never get old upon reviewings.A true comedic classic, but probably for more of a niche audience. Having never worked in an office before, you may not enjoy it as much as others...but then again, I could be wrong and is still worth checking out. But if you have or do work in an office, this movie is a must see!Office Space has a special place in my heart for others reasons too. Parts of it were filmed within walking distance of my apartment, and my girlfriend lives in Peter's apartments from the movie, which is also right down the street!

Not only does it give cubicle workers an excuse to poke fun at themselves, it's an all around laugh for anyone. It's played off the huge success of the comic strip ""Dilbert,"" and has taken it to the next level. I also recommend the soundtrack (especially the Geto Boys doing ""Damn It Feels Good To Be A Gangsta'"") as listening to it reminds you of every scene from the movie. Whether you enjoy gutting fish at your workspace, you hate your work's copier, or you are just out looking for a good time, ""Office Space"" is surely the movie for you!",Office Space

527,masonblalock,My all time favorite movie for years!,10,4 October 2012,"Office Space has always been almost a traditional comedy to watch in my family many times. The main attraction to this film is the clever comedy that is hidden. It is the kind of movie that you have to listen to it carefully to catch most of the jokes, which is hilarious! If you know the difficult life of working in a cubicle with a boss that drones on and on (which many of you may have), you will love this movie easily. This movie is also full of jokes that run out through the whole movie! (""Yeah...hi..."")Office Space is about the main character, Peter, who's life is incredibly boring due to doing the same thing every day, bosses he hates, and so on. He works for a large computer company called Initech that, working in a cubicle doing the same job every day. This is a job of just replacing lines of code with a simple fix. Peter and his friends then set up a virus that is supposed to steal from the company slowly...but then that goes awry.This is by far in my top 3 favorite movies of all time. I suggest you go watch it now!",Office Space
528,emantle,work DOES suck,10,4 February 2005,"Mike Judge is hardly a household name, perhaps you've heard of his creations? He is for those not in the know, the architect of the cult animation that is Beavis and Butt-head. With this to go on and boasting a cast of relative unknowns, excluding Jennifer Anniston whose film roles over the years since she became a Friend have, it's safe to say, not been awe inspiring; I was not too optimistic about something being aired on BBC1 at around 2am  it's hardly primetime is it? This was a year ago. Since that first viewing I've become a firm convert. For anyone who's ever worked in the kind of place where you're duped into wearing pieces of ""flair"" (ostentatious badges to show what a kooky and fun environment you work in), but then chastised at only wearing the minimum of 15 pieces; you should see this film. For anyone that has to endure repetitive days in an office whilst listening to the utter drivel that is poured from your employer's mouth; you should see this film. If your name is Michael Bolton; you should see this film. Whoever you are, I implore you  see this film. The plot is quite simple. Peter Gibbons, a disillusioned employee at Initech seeks hypnotherapist Dr Swanson's help to relieve him of the stress his working day brings. When Dr Swanson (Michael McShane) dies in the middle of the session without bringing Peter around, Gibbons is left with a newfound zest for apathy. He stops turning up for work and when he does he's brutally honest about his feelings to the consultants brought in to help on the layoffs. Naturally this is awarded with a promotion from John C. McGinley, whom you might recognise from Scrubs. Ron Livingston delivers a sublime performance as Peter Gibbons whilst at the same time managing to look not dissimilar to the bane of British comedy that is Jimmy Carr. David Herman and Ajay Naidu as Gibbons' friends are perfectly cast. Gary Cole as Lumbergh is utterly detestable as the slimy manager  picture David Brent only without the comedy. In fact every member of the cast, however small the role appears perfectly at home here. Even Jennifer Anniston playing Gibbons' love interest  also unhappy with her career - shines as Joanna. Stephen Root however, stole the film for me as Milton, the pitiful individual described as ""the squirrelly looking guy, who mumbles a lot."" By the time arguably the most violent baseball bat vs. photocopier scene I could have envisioned was screened, I think I knew that I was witnessing something special. This is utterly identifiable as being Mike Judge's baby, the obscure characters, bizarre humour, and an underlying theme of self gratification oozes out of the celluloid. Perhaps my biggest regret then is the lack of anything other than a trailer as a special feature on the DVD. Having said that  watching the film dubbed into Spanish was rather memorable.",Office Space
529,alexmayol,Good comedy,7,18 November 2012,"Mike Judge is one of those authors quite unknown in France, his films are not going out to the movies and his legendary series, Beavis & Butt-Head passing only sporadically on MTV. Office Space is a great comedy that would really come out in France, a sort of The Office before the hour, a comedy about the dotcoms U.S. and working conditions. We've seen stories of people who take their lives, suddenly, but now it is the opposite, a person who decides to make concessions. It changes and it is welcome. The film also owes much to its stakeholders, and especially the trio, Ron Livingston, Ajay Naidu and David Herman. The supporting roles are known and are also good. But what really makes this film out of the average, it is absolutely perfect staging of Mike Judge, especially in the second part of the film, with the scene of destruction copier, filmed like a rap video. Work on the sound is absolutely fantastic. The film is really excellent. As proof, his only fault is to be too short. This is rare as the default. And it is synonymous with a great film.",Office Space

It was funny when he said ""If I get lucky I might be able to show that chick from logistics my O face.... O..O...O."" I also like Lawrence. He was also funny in Napoleon Dynamite. In Office Space I thought it was funny when Peter said he wanted to do nothing and he replied ""Well you don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Look at my cousin, he's broke, don't do s**t."" Sameer Nageenanaja was a good character also. I liked how he could break dance and it was also cool when he would rap.

I'm a fan of pretty much all types of movies, comedies are probably my favorites. its hard to find a comedy thats so funny yet so accurate. the casting was good and i was surprised that there wasn't as much vulgar or ""innappropriate"" jokes. after all the Creator of this created ""beavis and butt head"" and ""king of the hill"". rent this movie on DVD. its the best.

532,ndchancelove,"One of the best satires, from the master",10,18 December 2012,"Mike Judge won me over with this gem. I love a good satire, and this is one of the best. It's like the comic strip 'Dilbert' writ large. The film is chock-full of delicious tidbits of cubicle-farm stupidity, micromanagement and insipid priorities. The whole culture of the corporate office gets turned on its head when Ron Livingston's jaded character experiences a bizarre hypnosis 'accident' that changes his entire perspective, making him a catalyst for change in the other characters. The resulting turn of events propels the film into regions of humor and situations highly contrary to the mundane existence portrayed at the outset. The characters are richly funny, the writing is poignant and the laughs are very satisfying. Setting the film's nerdy cast against a backdrop of gangsta rap only adds to the hilarity by creating such an improbable juxtaposition. This is one to watch annually, as there are so many moments to enjoy in the film. Judge is one of the best commentators on pop culture - period!",Office Space

In a disarmingly under-the-radar way, this throwaway continues to live on in memory. I saw it for the third time just a week ago and was surprised at how well it holds up. For a farce, it's also nicely understated in a number of ways. Example: when Ron Livingston explains to Jennifer Aniston that what he does for a living is recode database fields to include four digits rather than two, you realize that Initech, the company he works for, is basically a fly-by-night Y2K bottom-feeder of the sort that dotted the IT landscape in droves in the late Nineties.

I loved seeing the characters I worked with, and the pranks they engage in--I wish I'd thought of some of them! But once the characters were established and all the good pranks had been played, the film's cheesiness went into overdrive and the excitement tanked. If only its makers put as much effort into plot as setting!Apparently I need to write ten lines for a comment.

536,knowlesa,Office Space as Hamlet??,10,12 January 2005,"This is a excerpt from a paper I wrote for English 1020. I had to cut it down so, I hope you like it.** Thomas Foster in his book How To Read Literature Like a Professor shows how Shakespeare has influenced writers and readers today. Shakespeare is so ingrained in our lives most people don't even realize the influence. One such ""accidental"" retelling of a Shakespearian tragedy is Mike Judge's Office Space, a comedy about working in the ""Dilbert"" style offices of today. How does this story compare to a Shakespearian tragedy? It is obviously a modern day version of Hamlet. Peter is of course Hamlet. He is the young prince of the company, Initech. Initech would represent Denmark. Hamlet, mourning the loss of his father and resenting his uncle, the new king, opens the play with a visit from the ghost of his dead father. The movie opens with Peter being verbally reprimanded, in an extremely politically correct manner, for forgetting the new coversheet on the TPS reports. In the first few minutes of the movie eight people confront Peter about his TPS reports. Through the rest of the movie the TPS reports haunt Peter much like Hamlet's father haunts him. The ghost of Hamlet's father is trying to push Hamlet to revenge his death. Similarly the TPS reports keep coming up as a symbol of Peter's frustration with his job, pushing him to the edge where he is ready to take revenge on his boss. The relationship between Peter and his boss, Bill Lumbergh, is very much like Hamlet and the king. Peter has no respect for Lumbergh, and Lumbergh would just as soon get rid of Peter if he could. But Peter is the prince of the company. Everybody respects and looks up to him. He is the ""go to"" guy. Even Lumbergh knows he needs him. When work has to be done, Lumbergh calls on Peter to come in on the weekend. Although, when Peter goes off the deep end, Lumbergh is ready to get rid of him any way he can. This is very much like Hamlet. When the king can no longer control Hamlet, he is ready to have him killed. Just like in Hamlet, Lumbergh finds it is very difficult to get rid of Peter. This is where the two Bobs come in. Bob Slydell and Bob Porter are consultants hired by the company to ""reorganize"". Lumbergh expects them to fire Peter. Instead, the plan backfires and they promote him. The two Bobs are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. One cannot ignore the most famous line from Hamlet, ""To be or not to be,""(act 3 scene 1). Is Hamlet going to revenge his father's murder or just give up, maybe even kill himself? What is the question for Peter, the question that will define his life? Peter asks a question posed by his high school guidance counselor, ""What would you do with one million dollars?"" It is the deep philosophical question of the movie. If money were no object, what would you do with the rest of your life? For Peter it's a question of will he give up and resolve to work day in day out at Initech, or ""Suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune."" Peter, like Hamlet, determines to fight. Several other characters from the movie show similarities to characters from Shakespeare's play. Peter's friends at work, Michael and Samir combine to represent Laertes. The fatherly figure of Tom is Polonius. Tom's ""Jump to Conclusions Mat"" reminds me of Polonius' speech to Laertes, ""Neither a borrower nor lender be,"" Polonius full of advice just wants to make everyone happy. Polonius ends up dead by the hands of Hamlet. Tom ends up in a wheel chair with pins screwed into his head. Joanna is obviously Ophelia. Joanna does not die, but there is a great ""Get thee to a nunnery"" scene. Joanna also shows similarities to Gertrude when Peter mistakenly believes she slept with Lumbergh. Lest I forget, Peter's one true friend, Lawrence as Horatio, it is Lawrence who helps Peter finally find what he would do if he had one million dollars. A final character that cannot be excluded is Milton. Milton is the quiet background character that everyone is afraid will go postal at any time. They are so afraid of him, he was actually laid off two years earlier but no one bothered to tell him. Through a screw up in payroll he has been showing up and receiving a paycheck for the past two years. So, who is going to tell him he's fired? No one, they're not going to tell him. They're just going to stop the checks. Bill Lumbergh asks ""So um, Milton has been let go?"" Bob responds, ""Well just a second there, professor. We uh, we fixed the ""glitch"". So he won't be receiving a paycheck anymore, so it will just work itself out naturally."" Milton is Fortinbras, the Prince of Norway. Fortinbras, behind the scenes is moving with his army through the land on his way to Poland. The fear of Fortinbras is much like the fear of Milton. No one knows when he might attack, but attack he will. Lumbergh constantly antagonizes Milton, forcing him to move his desk further back until he is finally moved to the basement. Lumbergh also takes Milton's prized red stapler. I suggest the red stapler is a symbol of the death of Fortinbras' father. In the end Milton is the victor. He burns Initech to the ground and takes away the spoils, just as Fortinbras conquers Denmark. Is Shakespeare an archetype? Does Office Space borrow heavily from Hamlet? We can conclude as Foster does when he says, ""The writer we know better than any other, the one whose language and whose plays we ""know"" even if we haven't read him is Shakespeare."" The next time we see the movie Office Space we can watch and enjoy in a whole new way.",Office Space
537,l-c-collins,This movie was amazing!,10,10 December 2004,"Office Space was definitely the most hilarious comedy of the 90's. The plot, the main characters, and even the random characters through out the movie added to its laughs. The movie was not far-fetched at all; viewers of all ages and places could relate to it on many levels. The film took normal, every-day people with mediocre jobs and made them into something honest and tasteful: something the audience could laugh about and enjoy. No matter how many times I see the movie, there are still many scenes that make me laugh. Everything about it was hysterically funny and it is one of the most unique, creative comedies ever made. Office Space is definitely a must-see film!",Office Space
538,houseguest,A beautifully intelligent film that you will be quoting for ever.,10,18 January 2005,"This movie is an instant colt classic. Whenever you watch it you will become extremely lazy. In the same sense it almost makes you want to go get a job you hate just so you can do what they do. A solid cast is supported by an excellent soundtrack that plays at the right moment in the movie to get you in the mode. The one liners in this movie will make you the coolest and wittiest person in any conversation. Watching this movie can and will change your whole attitude on things.

539,jdevola,Most Fun!,8,29 March 2007,"This is the most fun and entertaining movie in years! This is a must-see, must-have DVD movie. Every time I watch this movie, I love it more and more. Mike Judge did an excellent job here; however, it could have been better. I guess he didn't expect it to gain such popularity, and who would have guessed? When I say it could have been better, I mean it could have played up the fun a little more. A good example is what happened to Tom (I loved the head brace!) That was done just right, but the smashing of the printer (PC LOAD letter?!) could have been played up differently, making it much funnier (the continuity sucks here, too, but I guess it saved a couple hundred bucks...). The shortcomings are minor, in the end, though, and despite its imperfections, this movie could not be done better!",Office Space
540,shellymascher,Tribute to Office Space,9,14 March 2005,"The quality of the movie Office Space can be measured by its candid depiction of one Information Technicians folly through life. Mike Judge has provided great insight into corporate America though this motion picture. Mr. Judge is a talented writer who can also be credited with King of the Hill and Beavis and Butthead. Office Space is based on Judge's previous series of animated shorts entitled Milton, which aired on Saturday Night Live. Office Space brilliantly takes on different aspects of the work place and brings them together in one well-written screenplay. It is one of those unique films that blur the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction. Although most of the scenarios are highly exaggerated, it still maintains a realistic quality. The movie revolves around main character Peter Gibbons who suffers from a premature mid-life crisis. The software firm Initech employs this young professional and has hired a consulting firm to facilitate downsizing. At this point in the movie the ""two Bob's"" are introduced. Bob Slydell and Bob Porter are the consultants responsible for evaluating employee performance and necessity. Simultaneously Peter visits a hypnotherapist's office and is under hypnosis when the therapist suffers a cardiac arrest. In his state of relaxation Peter is transformed from an uptight cubicle drone into a lackadaisical, albeit misdirected, twenty something in search of finding new ways to do nothing. The ""Bob's"" interview Peter and are impressed by his frankness. There are three main components that make this movie realistic: Cubicle Humor, Irritating Supervisor's, and Malfunctioning Equipment. Great character acting, a perfectly played out story line, and a remarkable soundtrack are among its many other attributes. If you have not had the joy of working in an office environment you know someone who has. Cubicle Humor: It consists of a loud squeaky voiced operator repetitively answering the phone and a moronic coworker Milton annoying Peter with his radio volume, which is on the verge of surpassing ""the reasonable level"" aloud at Initech. Milton is developed further in the movie as a dim-witted computer programmer with a desire to get his own revenge on Initech. Peter revolts against his surroundings by taking screws out of his cubicle walls and pushing the partition down. As an employee who has experienced the confinements of a cubicle I certainly delighted in this act of defiance. Irritating Bosses: Peter has eight of them. The VP of Initech is Peter's micromanaging boss Bill Lumbergh. The micro-management style of Bill Lumbergh in combination with the great comedic acting talent of Gary Cole is one of the many hilarious qualities that bring the movie Office Space to life. Lumbergh delights in harassing Peter with his condescending interrogation regarding TPS reports. Bill: ""What's up, Peter? How's it going? Uh, we have sort of a problem here. Yeah. You apparently didn't put one of the new cover sheets on your TPS reports."" Peter: ""Oh, yeah. I'm sorry for that. I, I forgot."" Bill: ""Yeah. You see, we're putting the cover sheets on all TPS reports. Did you get the memo about this?"" Peter: ""Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just forgot. But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no problem."" Bill: ""Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that would be great. Uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo, OK?"" Peter receives calls from his other seven bosses, regarding the same TPS report cover sheets, throughout this scene. Malfunctioning equipment: At the center of Initech is a malfunctioning fax machine. I have had my own problems with a certain copy machine at work. The scene where Michael Bolton is screaming at the fax machine, as if it were capable of comprehending his request, is classic. In the word's of Roger Ebert ""Reader, who has not felt the same?"" Peter is informed by the ""Bob's"" that he will be promoted while his friends Michael and Samir are going to be terminated. Peter consoles Michael and Samir by taking them to a remote location. He opens his trunk to reveal a stolen fax machine. Michael and Samir take their stored up frustration out by beating the fax machine with a baseball bat. The coworkers attempt to get revenge on Initech, through an embezzlement scheme, is botched and Milton ends up with the money after setting Initech on fire. In the departing scene you see Milton on the beach in an undisclosed location, while Peter is shoveling rubble as a construction worker. This movie is sure to become the hit of any office party. It has taken the mundane atmosphere of the workplace to a new level of comedic entertainment. I fear that I have not given this movie its due commendation. This is a movie you must see for yourself.",Office Space
541,starryeyed80,classic must-see for everyone with a job,9,19 March 2005,"I read a negative comment about this movie and just had to rebut. Office Space is an hysterical take on the bad experiences that we all have at work. From the annoying bosses to strange coworkers to that pain in the a** fax machine, it's got something for everyone to relate to. Peter (the main character, played by Ron Livingston) handles his work stress the way that Ithink we all wish we could, and viewers can live vicariously through his antics. The side characters only add to the fun, with my personal favorites being ""The Bobs"", who show us the funny side of efficiency experts. I can't recommend this movie enough. It should be required watching for anyone working in an office.",Office Space

Jennifer Aniston is so hot in this movie, if there really is a girl like that than we should hook up. After watching this movie, I decided to cut work for three days and was fired from my job.

I have never posted on IMDb before but I feel compelled to do so in the case of this movie. The 7.7 rating is totally misleading. This is the poorest comedy I have sat through in a long long time. I worked in an office for 5 years until I got a life myself and I appreciated some of the gags but 7.7? Spare yourself the hour and a half and watch something really funny like 40 year old virgin instead. Its so hard to find good comedies these days that I have resorted to going back to look for missed (possible) classics and I was hoping this would be one.Maybe its just too dated or maybe I was too tired watching this but funny it was not. A slight sparkle in places, an odd chuckle and the constant hope that its going to get better after sitting through the first 20 minutes. Sadly it didn't. In fact, I would like someone who has never seen it to it through it just so I do not feel like a ***t for dissing a classic comedy.

No one is satisfied with where they are in life and they don't really care enough to do anything about it. Apathy is the way of the world. That is until the scent of a big fat payday comes into the picture. Sound familiar? This movie is so good because everyone knows somebody who is always hatching that big scheme to land on easy street. Unfortunately the plan never seems to come to fruition. Office Space rocks because it stars people who look like everyday people. Look around your office and you'll see a Bill Lumbergh, a Peter, and a Samir. Go to your neighborhood Applebee's and you'll see a disgruntled waitress making the day go by. No surprises, just life as we know it. Work sucks, but what are you gonna do???",Office Space

Furthermore, all three of them will risk going to jail to sabotage the company with a computer virus. I remember watching this movie when it first came out. That was 6 years ago and I didn't understand a lot of the crude and inappropriate jokes. It was a lot more funny watching it the second time and there was parts of the movie that I didn't remember.Everybody hates their jobs in the movie Office Space and they aren't even worried about getting fired. They take their anger out on printers and copy machines. When Peter sleeps at night all he thinks about is how much his life sucks and that he wishes he could lay around and do nothing all day. Some employees even day dream of burning down the building. Working at Inotech, Makes the lives of the employees a living hell. Anybody who works there would rather get laid off then to stand another day working for Mr. Lumberg.For Peter, Michael and Samir everyday is the worst day of their lives. Peter even goes to a psychologist to discuss his life and how much he hates it. The psychologist helps him, however, with hypnosis. He isn't the only one that thinks his life sucks. His girlfriend Joanna works at a local diner and hates her job so she freaks out and quits. They need to find a way to get even.Furthermore, all three of them will risk going to jail to sabotage the company with a computer virus. The virus rounds off small amounts of money and transacts money from the company into a neutral bank account. They figured little by little money would be transferred so no one would notice the small amounts missing. The three believed that even if they got caught they would not even have to serve time, however, when $305,000 was transferred to their account they thought different.This movie was great and it had a good plot.

549,mojo_h_oconnor,One for anyone office-bound,8,22 November 2005,"This is a classic tale of David versus Goliath, of standing up to oppression. The only difference is that Pete Gibbons (the excellent Ron Livingston) fights not with action, but inaction.By refusing to quit his job, and refusing to attend and do his work, Pete manages to succeed where before he has failed, in both his professional and love life.Having worked in an office environment for a number of years, i found the most appealing part of the movie the characters that Mike Judge populates the initech office with. From the fearful immigrant, the useless guy with no obvious function in life all the way up to the always pally but deeply satanic boss. Its not that these people exist in any workplace, but the traits they possess can be seen all around you. As far as the plot goes, i am glad that the romantic story was kept to the background and doesn't try to dominate the film. This understated story thus helps the main plot, not cramping it.If you are looking for some laughs and interesting characterization, check out office space, you wont be disappointed.",Office Space
550,amelio74,office space,10,16 December 2005,"Milton In Office Space, Milton is seldom ever taken seriously. He is constantly being taken advantage of. First of all, Lumberg never returned the stapler that he had asked for several times. Not to mention, he asked to keep his desk where it was so he didn't have to move it again, but instead, he was pushed into the dark basement. So, in return, Milton took advantage of Initech, the company where he worked. My brother, George, bought Office Space, a few years ago. He really gets a kick out of it because he, too, wishes that he could get paid for doing nothing. There are several parts in that movie that he finds humorous. One day, he and I even mimicked the movie by smashing a computer monitor with a baseball bat. And for him, that was pure fun. But while George liked Office Space from the start, I had to watch it two or three times before I really started to admire the film. Now, every time I watch it, I find something new to laugh about. Near the beginning of the film, Lumberg took Milton's red stapler- Milton's favorite stapler because it didn't back up. And Milton automatically started to panic as his eyes widened and he started mumbling about how the last time someone took his stapler, they didn't return it. But even with the shock on Milton's face, Lumberg ignored him; he would simply override Milton's voice and say his famous, ""yeahhh."" When Milton realized that Lumberg wasn't going to return the stapler, he even confronted the receptionist. She also ignored him. Taking Milton's stapler wasn't enough for Lumberg though. When Lumberg told Milton that he'd have to get ready to move his desk, Milton pleaded not to because he had already moved his desk several times. In fact, he once had his desk near a window, but was eventually moved to a smaller cubicle surrounded florescent lights. But Lumberg didn't even consider listening to Milton. Instead, he told Milton that he needed to move his desk into the basement as soon as possible because there wasn't enough room for him upstairs. Milton tried, again, to explain that he had already moved his desk so many times, and he didn't want to do it again. And once again, he was ignored, while Lumberg said, ""yeah, if you could move it that'd be great."" When Milton found himself sitting in the dark basement, that's when he decided that ""that was the last straw."" Milton was getting so angry lately that he even threatened under his breath that he'd burn the building down. So in return, Milton decided to give Initech a little taste of what he was really capable of. He was going to tell Lumberg that he was taking his stapler back. When he charged into Lumberg's office to retrieve his stolen property, the audience were led to believe that he discovered the money stolen by Peter, Michael and Samir, because he walked into the office in the scene right after the scene where Peter puts an envelope with the money under Lumberg's door. Then, I can only assume that he burns the building down as promised earlier in the movie because the building is burnt right after the scene where Milton stumbles upon the envelope. Milton then vacationed on a hot, sunny beach without a care in the world. And he was living Peters dream - Milton was doing nothing. So throughout the whole movie, we were led to believe Milton was just an unattractive man who could be stepped on by anyone. We watched other people judge him, and we began to judge him too. But we were proved to be wrong about him; he's not as stupid as he seemed. He was bright enough to take the money without any remorse and simply go on vacation. And now, he had the power to boss other people around; now he could get what he wanted. He, the one who had been taken advantage of, was now taking advantage of others. He was the one who prevailed.",Office Space
551,chartreuss-sss,cult classic,10,24 January 2006,"I can't think of too many movies I'd watch 5 or 6 times a year, but ""Office Space"" definitely makes the cut.And while the subject matter seems inane, each time I watch it I pick up more nuances in each character and it makes me want to know them more.The premise actually becomes funnier the more you see it, because you notice more with every viewing. Sometimes you'll be laughing at one scene and miss something else in that scene or something in the next.Every time I ask someone if they've seen ""Office Space"" they inevitably respond with ""No, I never really knew about it, but I hear it's a cult classic! Now I want to see it."" I think it might be the type of movie you either ""get"" or don't ""get,"" so you'll love it or hate. I love it! Give it a try; you'll become addicted.",Office Space
552,jihjih,Office Space Review,9,13 October 2017,"What would you do with $1 million? While some would say ""take a vacation"" or ""buy a new home"", Office Space shows the beauty and disparity of doing ""nothing"". Before any dialogue, we see Peter, the protagonist, stopping and starting in his car. This is a metaphor for his boring and stressful life. The constant accelerating and breaking speaks directly to the stagnant state of his life. When he glances out of window, the old man was stopping and starting as well. He realizes that he could potentially live and die in this mundane lifestyle. As he swerves into the adjacent lane and is stopped, he realizes that his life is inescapable. The opening scene was packed full of social commentary on the immobile and mundane nature of office work. Viewers were also exposed to one of the conflicts of the film.Interestingly, Mike Judge based this movie on the famous newspaper cartoon Milton, but chose to focus on the life of Peter, his coworker. In the film, Milton is portrayed by Stephen Root and is one of the most interesting examples of foreshadowing and his stapler is a constant thread throughout the film. The resolution to Peter's problems is a result of Milton carrying out an act that he had been threatening to do from the beginning of the film. As far as character arc, Mike Judge made some pretty cheesy and predictable decisions. Deus Ex Machina made several appearances in Office Space. The strongest elements of this film are the social commentary on the terribly boring lifestyle of working a white-collar office job, the foreshadowing because of its effectiveness and ability to move the plot along, and the conflict/resolution.It was nice to see a film that I could laugh at a little, but the deeper message cannot be missed. In my opinion, the deeper message of this film lies in the dissatisfaction that is a result of a lack of motivation and happiness. The entire film is centered around Peter's unhappiness. The commentary that the droning days in an office can drive people insane and into suicide (Tom Symkowski's failed attempt) is a direct critique of the cubicle style workplace. His unhappiness at work was driving him into a depression.I enjoyed this film. There are so many elements and characters I could talk about and I highly recommend watching this at first alone and then with friends to get some different interpretations. I give Office Space 5 out of 5 Michael Bolton songs.",Office Space
553,alanpolsky,It comes too close to reality,9,2 December 2005,"I haven't worked in a large office for many years, but the situations portrayed in this movie are timeless. When I discuss this movie with teenagers, they fall into two groups. The first group claims that the situations depicted could not come close to reality. Little do they know. The second group wants to know what exactly are TPS reports, and don't believe that they don't exist. That is the point of the movie...reality and absurdity become indistinguishable. This is not a morality play. Its done strictly for laughs. But anyone who has worked in an office will occasionally cringe at how close to reality some of the absurd situations come. Considering that there are no high quality actors in the film, the acting is pretty much on target across the board. Each character is brought to life in a vivid way. After three viewings, it may be difficult to lead your own life without quoting a line from the movie. This will be a cult classic for all time.",Office Space
554,imdb-11596,excellent movie,10,30 December 2005,"this movie is excellent. I saw it several times with friends. Somehow a woman who studies informatics thinks the film is dumb, perhaps the programmers are in a wrong light. But I also study informatics and laughed all the film as many of my friends who have seen it too. Perhaps she takesit too serious. As someone already said, you have later on fun commenting the film on the other days. and a computer worker will know it the problems with printers or for foreign language it is fun to see what errors can happen in the programming language because of different systems in different countries as for example centimeter or inch, because they also really happen and will have happen to you at least one time. The music and Gangsta Rap are really funny.I recommend it viewing this film with friends as this will be even more fun and even fun after having seen.'kay, have fun with this film!",Office Space
