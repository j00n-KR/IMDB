0,SnoopyStyle,Lin-Manuel Miranda and Gloria Estefan,7,11 August 2021,"Vivo is a kinkajou monkey. He works the tourists in the Havana streets with music legend Andrés Hernández. After Andrés' death, Vivo goes on a mission to deliver his last song to his old musical partner Marta Sandoval in her last performance in Miami. He sneaks into the luggage of little girl Gabi on her way back to Key West.This is a Lin-Manuel Miranda animated musical with a healthy dash of Gloria Estefan. The animation comes from Sony and shown on Netflix. It's Ice Age level animation. I actually got into the simplicity of the quest which has a compelling heart. There is a catchy song although the earworm is rather repetitively annoying. The songs are all very Lin-Manuel Miranda if you know what I mean. It's good but he's also over-saturated by now. All in all, this is good but it doesn't hit that hard.",Vivo
1,paulclaassen,Way too many issues (for me)...,3,30 October 2021,"I think its becoming increasingly challenging coming up with interesting ideas and characters for animated movies. I was looking forward to a new animated movie, but - unfortunately - I was not overly impressed with 'Vivo'.Credit where credit is due: the animation is stunning! It is beautiful and colorful. The original musical numbers were also good. There were also some very funny moments, and there's a great call to adventure.So, why didn't I like the movie then? It didn't feel original. It felt like a 'Coco' wannabe, and the songs sounded all too familiar to the style of 'The Greatest Showman', as if they were hoping to create a 'Greatest Showman' type soundtrack. Regarding the titular character, Vivo, I wasn't always sure whether it was meant to be a cat or a monkey. Turns out it is a kinkajou, but it doesn't even remotely look like one. I also wasn't sure whether this creature was actually able to talk, or just make sounds, and they added the dialogue for us to understand it better. Or could this creature talk?So, the film is about an elderly man, Andres, who looks after a kinkajou called Vivo. Together they perform every day in the local plaza - until Andres receives a letter from Marta Sandoval - the love of his life, although he never told her that. Marta is now an accomplished singer, and wants Andres to perform at her final show. Uhm, this is where they start pushing the boundaries of believability. Why would she want him to perform? According to the story they haven't seen (or spoken) to each other in 60 years. So, why after six decades would she suddenly want him to perform with her? And when she doesn't hear from him, she's so upset at her final show that she doesn't even want to go on stage. Wha-a-a-a-at??? She hasn't seen the man in sixty years, now she's upset about him not coming to her show???Sadly, Andres died a day before leaving for the show. (Off course, he didn't even tell Marta he received her letter, and was interested in going. This film is set in modern day, so there are phones, and Internet, so what the hell?? If it was set hundred years ago, it would have made more sense). Vivo, in the meantime, made friends with Gabi - to score a free ride to Miami, where Marta is to perform her final show, and Vivo needs to take a song to her which Andres wrote (for her...). Oh, whatever, I'm done with all these conveniences and coincidences. Let's just say there are too many reasons why I didn't like this film.Also, some scenes were cartoonish and silly and definitely more for a young audience.Would I watch it again? No.",Vivo
2,briancham1994,Jumbled,6,2 October 2021,"This film is definitely not the sum of its parts. The emotional core of the story can't really be identified among its messy composition - is it the bond between Vivo and Andrés? The tension between Gabi and her ""friends"", or between her and her mother? The prior relationship between the singer and Andrés? The swamp animals? The new relationship between Vivo and Gabi? The plot bounced between these so much that none of them fulfilled their full potential, even if the individual moments were enjoyable to watch and punctuated with lively musical sequences (brash, but lively). Gabi is quite loud and seems like an annoying comedic relief sidekick elevated to the status of main character, which makes it much harder to watch. This ultimately felt like a series of talented skits barely stitched together. By the end, I was wondering ""what was that really about?""",Vivo
3,rannynm,"A Vivid Animated Film Full Of Life, Color, Music And Emotion",10,21 September 2021,"As its name suggests, Vivo is a vivid animated film full of life, color, music and emotion. Directed by Kirk DeMicco and Brandon Jeffords,Vivo is the first-ever musical for Sony with a Latino theme, and the story is certainly very relevant and aims to be significant for the Latino community. Vivo features all-new songs written and performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda which are powerful, emotive and contribute nicely to the storytelling.Vivo is about the way we connect with others through music. In a very old-fashioned Cuba, a kinkajou named Vivo is voiced by Lin-Manuel Miranda. A kinkajou is a mammal that looks like a monkey but is a rainforest ""honey bear."" Vivo and his owner Andrés enjoy making music and performing together. When Andrés receives an invitation from his friend, famous singer Marta Sandoval (Gloria Estefan), to attend her farewell show in Miami, Vivo is in charge to deliver the message to reconnect their friendship.Vivo connects with our inner and pure childhood emotions and the characters in this story are lovable and relatable. For example, with the help of a young girl, Gabi, our protagonist Vivo is able to make the journey to Miami. Gabi, an aspiring musician, is a girl with talent and ambition, but rebellious and spontaneous. Gabi is a very special character representing the effervescent tween years where not everything fits in the molds of society. The animation in Vivo is gorgeous: the characters are colorful and vibrant. The attention to detail in the architecture and landscapes of Cuba is breathtaking. The presence of nature is also key to the story. As Vivo and Gaby navigate their way to Miami, they travel through the Everglades and encounter the wildlife at its fullest.Vivo demonstrates a nice balance between traditions and everyday life and new adventures and discovering life out of our boundaries. Another great success is how the film resonates with a multigenerational audience, connecting youngsters and older members of the family effectively making it a perfect experience that unites the whole family. Vivo shows us the power of music in making connections between us and how music helps us to achieve goals.I give Vivo 5 out of 5 stars and recommended it for all 8 to 18, plus adults. Vivo opens in theaters and Netflix on August 6, 2021.Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!",Vivo
4,Sir_AmirSyarif,"A lively, Cuban-infused animated musical with plenty of laughs",7,8 August 2021,"Kirk DeMicco's 'Vivo' is a lively, exuberant, Cuban-infused animated musical with with plenty of laughs. Lin-Manuel Miranda provides charming, catchy songs ('My Own Drum' is a banger!) that seamlessly merge with the animation in an impeccably synchronized song and dance. Ynairaly Simo's voice work is energetic.",Vivo
5,Movi3DO,Fun and enjoyable,7,7 August 2021,"What difference can one song make?A new animated musicals from Netflix. Vivo, a music-loving kinkajou, embarked on a journey to deliver his friend's last song.Most of the songs in the movie were entertaining to listen to. They gave enjoyable vibes and energy to the scenes. Also, the animation was superb and worked well with the music. One of the songs, even though it had fun animation, was pretty annoying because the singer was screaming for most of it.The story was nothing new for a musical movie. The trip that Vivo and the kids went through, although funny at times, was silly and kinda pointless. I would have liked it more if the journey had a bigger impact on either Vivo or the kids. However, the core of the story was Vivo, in horror of his friend, delivering a song to a famous singer. This part at the end was good and impactful.The characters were straightforward as well. Most of the characters didn't grow that much through their journey. They did try to have emotions, but besides the main story, I didn't get much from the other characters.Overall, despite the typical story, great animation and story still made the movie entertaining and fun, especially for kids and family. 7/10.",Vivo
6,legobuilderpro,Musical journey,6,6 August 2021,"I liked the animation and Vivo played by Lin Manuel Miranda, it was pretty to look at and some funny scenes I liked.The original songs that Lin Manuel Miranda made for the movie sounded nice and either fits the character or the situation they are in.Also there are some effective emotional scenes, I had fun and enjoyed this animated journey.",Vivo
7,djurrepower,eh ok,5,14 August 2021,"Sure some competent ideas, but overall the movie felt patchy. Most of the songs didn't flow well with the story, and some plotlines felt shoehorned in. So all in all a overall fine movie, but could have been more streamlined.",Vivo
8,SoumikBanerjee25,Music Is the Definitve Highlight Here!,6,12 August 2021,"""If anyone asks, you are my emotional support animal""Following back-to-back triumphs in the Animation space; Sony is back at it yet again! This time with 'Vivo'. If I were to sum it up; this is a heartwarming musical that reflects upon the Cuban People as well as their rich Culture and is imbued with sumptuous melodies and prismatic imageries.It may not attain the same peak of perfection as Spider-Verse or The Mitchells vs The Machines did, but I will say this; with its multifarious stylizing and lighthearted approach, it does leave a good impression overall.All credit goes to its rather scintillating Score, which courteously combined a myriad of Genres and their distinguishable characteristics. Coupled with an array of stunning visuals and dozens of wonderful songs; there can be no doubt that this was a sight for sore eyes or for that matter, the ears too.The only drawbacks that can be found are buried deep in its Writing and the bulk of them correlates with character portrayals (Or I should say the lack of them). Storywise, I feel it was never meant to go the extra mile. Like Never! Therefore the plot comes off as pretty generic and similar remarks apply to all the characters, except for Vivo.He contributes a lot in regards to the emotional moments and their general effectiveness. I was a little surprised to see myself teared up many a time (Which I didn't really expect).Time to find me a Kinkajou, I guess! :-D.",Vivo
9,elicopperman,The Kinkajou that Saved the Love of Music and Friendship,7,7 August 2021,"Ever since its announcement in the mid 2010s, a little passion project from Lin Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegría Hudes came into the limelight at Sony Pictures Animation, simply known as Vivo. Despite getting the shaft from worldwide theaters to be generally released on Netflix, like the other SPA films of this year, the film has been getting all kinds of love and attention from critics and audiences as of late. As of now, this marks the studio's first ever full length musical feature, with all of the songs created by Miranda himself, who also lent his voice to the titular character. So, now that it's out and about, how does it stand on its own?The movie follows a one-of-kind kinkajou named Vivo, whose Cuban music playing owner Andres receives a letter from his old partner, the famous Marta Sandoval, telling him to attend a farewell concert. Due to tragedy striking poor Andres, it's up to Vivo to deliver a love letter to Marta, in the form of a song. Along the way to get to Marta, he meets the rebellious youngster Gabi, and the two bounce to the beat of their own drum to fulfill Andres' wishes. Now off the bat, this isn't the most stunning premise for a movie, as a lot of familiar beats are included to move the plot forward. You got the main character's arc of trying to fulfill his original owner's destiny, the crazy annoying side character, the obstacles expected when trying to deliver an important message, the macguffin, etc. In addition, one could imagine that since this is Vivo's story, that Gabi didn't necessarily need to be there, especially when there are a lot of strange things Vivo encounters outside his original home. Plus, it does take a while to get used to Gabi's overly obnoxious demeanor, no matter how rebellious it may be.However, where the film lacks a strongly enticing premise, it more than makes up for in its execution. Given how many hurdles Vivo has to jump through in order to deliver his important love song to Marta Sandoval, the stakes really do come up at the expense of knowing whether or not Vivo can deliver the gift of not. As the film's biggest message is about loving someone that meant so much to you in the past, one can already root for Vivo just to reunite the love of his owner's life. Admittedly, that mission does end up losing some momentum around the second act once Vivo has to go through the harsher realities Florida has to offer nature-wise, but there are some cute friends and terrifying enemies that Vivo and Gabi meet along the way, so it ends up being in lieu of character development. In fact, while this is mainly Vivo's story through thick and thin, a lot of significant changes end up compromising Gabi and Andres' own family during the course of the film due to the connection between the musical kinkajou and his charming owner. How sweet when a monkey can bring a whole family back together again.In terms of art direction, the movie is nothing short of gorgeous, especially in contrast from Cuba to Florida. The luscious landscapes of retroistic Havana may look down to Earth, but once we're in Florida, the film pulls no shortcuts in allowing the diverse amount of locations to speak for themselves in terms of lighting, scale, sets, exterior decor, and other fascinating material far beyond what the naked can spot. In addition, the more peaceful looking towns in Miami are nothing compared to the grandiose ultra vibrant city that the place is most well known for, as well as the dangerous everglades. Character wise, the cast look appropriately structured and caricatured enough to stand out amongst each other, and the motion allows for some solid performances, aided by a brilliant cast of Miranda, Ynairaly Simo, Zoe Saldana, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez and more. The true experimental highlights of the visuals are reserved for the wonderful musical numbers though, and that's where the animation crew really got to shine in bringing lush latino artwork inside the world of moving images.Speaking of the musical numbers, a lot of them vary in tune, but they all carry the plot and motivations forward beautifully. The opening song, One of a Kind, immediately establishes the tight connection Vivo has with Andres as his original owner, with some authentically upbeat Cuban tunage. Other songs establish a character's inner desires, like the harmoniously colorful Mambo Cabana for Andres' love of Marta, the modernesque upbeat My Own Drum that sets up Gabi's rebellious dominance, and even the suavely romantic Love's Gonna Pick you Up, reserved for two quirky spoonbills in love. Other songs merely move the plot forward to be in lieu of bigger scenes like the intensively catchy Keep the Beat and the dangerously tense Tough Crowd. And then there's the love song made for Marta, which not only serves as a solemn reminder of the old friend Marta once knew, but also encapsulates the movie's themes as a beacon of hope to those who are still loved by those from their past. Needless to say, Miranda truly outdid himself as the song auteur he is, for a family audience this time around.It's amazing the wonders someone as beloved and gifted as Miranda and his creative partner can bring to the world when given the right opportunity to shine. So while it may not offer too many surprises along its way, Vivo is quite the engaging adventure that livens up with some charming characters, appetizing visuals and some of the finest songs in Miranda's discography. If you are yet to see this film or are a pure Miranda enthusiast, then by all means give it a go on Netflix. At this point, with all of the lovely content Sony, Miranda and more are bringing to the world, only time will tell what's left up their sleeves.",Vivo
10,PedroPires90,Pretty but empty,6,16 August 2021,"The beginning is great, some interesting musical numbers, representation is great, but it feels...empty.It's just an ok film with a very weak plot that everybody will forget soon.",Vivo
11,tommypezmaster,Short but Sweet,10,10 August 2021,"Sony and Netflix does it again after The Michelles Vs. The Machines. The musical numbers are catchy, the tone is beautiful and.the characters are very soild. Everything Megamind and Free Birds should be.",Vivo
12,pranayjalvi,"An animated musical, sounds great",8,7 August 2021,"Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, the film boasts the rich, professional look of first-rate computer animation, even if ""Vivo"" plays by a more conventional stylebook than the studio's recent breakthroughs ""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" and ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" The character designs are fine, if not especially inspired (including that of Vivo, whose huge eyes would've been cuter without all that white space).It's Miranda's Latin-centered music that gives the project much of its personality, but in scenes like these, the visuals really sing and ""Vivo"" truly comes alive.My Rating : 8/10.",Vivo
13,eldreddsouza,6.7 for this? C'mon guys.,8,26 September 2021,"At first I was a bit sceptical about this film and that's mainly because of such a low rating. But after I got done with this film, my eyes were moist and I felt a sense of complete satisfaction. It's because this movie is so beautiful and will surely touch your heart just as Pixar films do.The animation is absolutely stunning. The characters are awesome and you connect to them easily. Vivo is super cute and fun and Lin Manuel Miranda is an incredibly gifted musician. His music is absolutely fantastic and uplifts this film greatly. Yes there are plot holes and at times I found myself laughing at some of the things happening in the film, but by the end of it I was quite overwhelmed by the overall film that I didn't really mind those plot holes.And yeah, I really don't get the low ratings. This is on par with the greats, I.e. Disney and Pixar. This film has heart, great animation and fantastic music. So it really deserves more love and none of the hate.Great job Sony!",Vivo

15,witra_as,Heartwarming journey to find long-lost love,8,10 August 2021,Heartwarming animated musical from Cuba to Florida with simple story and vibrant visuals both adults and children can enjoy.

16,tonymars-63087,The very embodiment of meh,1,13 August 2021,"Music from this part of the world is so rich and diverse and it was basically turned into generic elevator music. Terrible accents BTW, like people that speak Spanish can't speak English without an accent, ridiculous. Chock full of cliches and jokes that missed their mark. Oh yeah, some voices weren't meant for voice work, just saying.",Vivo
17,BijeshNagesh,A Treat For The Heart & Soul,8,7 August 2021,"The movie started great and flowed beautifully to a crescendo. It was essentially a celebration of Cuban music that I am sure Pixar would have been jealous they didn't get to first. Though ""Vivo"" had several similar elements from the 2016 ""Sing"" animation musical, it still relied on its own unique cultural flavours and settings to impart a special message through the power of song.Lin-Manuel Miranda's touch prevailed throughout the film, which is primarily about a primate named Vivo, whom Lin-Manuel voiced. The primate in question is a rainforest kinkajou (or 'honey bear', as it's colloquially known).Zoe Saldana's Rosa and Ynairaly Simo's Gabi were equally entertaining. The leader of the Sand Dollar Scouts, voiced by Katie Lowes, was amazing - she was supposedly the 'bad girl' early in this movie, but her heart was in the right place regarding the protection of the environment and its species.Michael Rooker's Lutador (the 'big bad' noise-hating serpent of the Florida swamps) was an interesting addition to the voice-talent pool, and so was Brian Tyree Henry's Dancarino (the quirky love-struck spoonbill bird of the Florida swamps) and Nicole Byer's Valentina (the female spoonbill who catches Dancarino's eye, and heart). Leslie David Baker as the Florida bus driver was a soft hoot - wish they gave him a character with more lines, though.Watch this film after you've taken a moment of cleanse your expectations of Disney and Pixar fare that uses similar themes. ""Vivo"" has its own unique timing, pacing, and overall design to the story, and is best savoured with a fresh perspective.At the heart of the plot is the answer to the ageless question, ""What difference can one song make?"" This notion was strongly linked to the unrealized romance between Marta Sandoval (voiced by the excellent Gloria Estefan) and Andrés (enlivened by the smooth-n-charming voice-talent of Juan de Marcos González).The music as well as the animation were sublime. Sony Pictures Animation must have chosen some of their best to work on this movie, because it looks amazing - those textures, those vibrant hues, those realistic fabric movements. Alex Lacamoire and Lin-Manuel Miranda worked on scoring ""Vivo"", and their combination is clearly gold. Check out the entire soundtrack, which is available at Atlantic Records (YouTube).Kirk DeMicco's direction kept the story going strong, without any irrelevant plot-deviations. It was wonderful to see a non-Pixar movie, in this case ""Vivo"" Netflix, pull off that 'magic' formula that I once believed only the House of Mouse could wield.Kirk worked on screenplay with Quiara Alegría Hudes - outstanding scripting and dialogues. The original story came from the minds, nay hearts, of Quiara Alegría and Peter Barsocchini.An ocean of passion clearly went into this project. As a result, I 'felt' the music calling to me from within a simple computer screen and speaker system rather than anything grand and 'box-office' theatrical. I have renewed admiration for Netflix after what they have done with this number.That heart-wrenching moment when Vivo loses Andrés before the man can finally have that 'one last dance' with, and sing that 'one last song' for, his beloved Marta... The heart-break came early in the movie, and set a superb tone for the rest of the film. It then fell to Vivo himself to deliver the last song that his caretaker, father figure, and best friend wrote for Marta, whom he silently loved, so much so that he didn't tell her he did so she wouldn't choose to stay back with him and give up her dream-career in the USA.One song can indeed make a difference in each of our lives, perking us up when we are down, and inspiring us to dream bigger and desire better. One song certainly made a difference in the lives of the characters in ""Vivo"" 2021. This animation-musical has a message we all need to be reminded of in these times. ""Viva la Vivo!""",Vivo
18,nasdagoodshepherd,"You've done it again, Sony.",9,6 August 2021,"Once again, Sony Pictures Animation and Netflix releases another film this year and that's Vivo. I watched it and I loved it so much, believe it or not but there are a ton of great musical numbers in this movie, they are all great to listen to. I really love the animation and the art style. Just looking at the character designs, especially Vivo, Gabi and the Sand Dollars, they are all adorable. I also love the story and the humor too. Just looking at the animation style makes you think that this movie looks like it came out of DreamWorks Animation or Blue Sky Studios (R. I. P Blue Sky Studios and screw you Disney) and of course, this movie has plenty of heart and likable characters. Vivo is undoubtedly one of the absolute best animated movies from Sony Pictures Animation and I believe that this movie will be part of the Oscars. I give Vivo a 9.5/10.",Vivo
19,stefstars,Great Family Film,7,17 August 2021,"I really enjoyed this film, I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It has a touching storyline. It deals with the topics of grief and loss, but not in a downer way. Like the culture that inspired this story, the film is very colorful and lively despite these serious subjects that it's presenting to children. My personal favorite thing about this film is how the long lost lovers of the film resemble Cuban legends Celia Cruz and Pedro Knight - a real life couple who made music history together in Cuba and Miami (really the whole world).I loved the opening scenes in Cuba, the animation was lovely. I really liked the settings in this film, they were very nicely rendered and I liked the bright/bold color scheme chosen because it perfectly highlights the liveliness of the two cities the film takes place in. I wasn't a fan of the character design though, particularly of the mom and daughter character. I didn't mind the other characters, as much as I did them, the small faces on big heads and bodies - idk it reminded me of the Ralph's or GrubHub commercials. I loved the Celia Cruz and Pedro Knight characters (despite the fact that neither of them got enough screen time) I liked the little girl and I'm in between when it comes to Vivo. The animals they came across in the swamp were charming in their own way, Yandu snake was an entertaining antagonist, and I was indifferent to the mom character. The characters I could not stand were the Girl Scout ones. They were the main antagonists I suppose, who later have change of hearts, but I found them so poorly written and more annoying than anything. I think the writers didn't know who or what to make as an antagonist and made these characters play that role as a last minute thing, cos everything about them seemed sloppy.However, they weren't the only sloppy thing about the film. Throughout the film we're focused on Vivo's and the little girl's budding friendship who are united by their grief from losing someone they cared about. Both essentially lost their fathers, since the Pedro Knight character was like a father to Vivo as one of the first songs in the film explains how they met. This comes to be the main focus of the film, as well as the love story between the singer characters. However towards the end, the film decides that it also was telling the story about how the little girl's mother is struggling to raise her kid and understand her after the passing of the father. The way they reach the resolution of that though is very rushed and quite out of the blue as well. We had seen the mother and daughter bickering since their trip to Cuba to honor their late relative, but it didn't seem like it was an important point of the story since it took a backseat throughout the whole film. We just see the mom going after her kid because obviously she's worried for her and upset that she was disobedient, but it doesn't come off as a ""mom will understand her kid"" sort of storyline, just a ""concerned mom wants to find her kid"" type of story. If the former is the type of story they wanted to tell then perhaps the mother should have been an antagonist, in the way that the Little Mermaid's dad was, for example. I would rather it have been her or anyone/anything else than the annoying Girl Scout characters. This was something that bothered me in regards to the story.The score is catchy, except for the little girl's song. Of all the songs in the film, that was the only one I wasn't feeling. It was a very expository song too. I guess, all of them are, when you think about it - Lin Manuel Miranda writes Broadway musicals after all. However this song drags on so long to explain the little girl's backstory and feelings. It's the longest song in the film and they probably thought this was the catchy song of the soundtrack since they play it during the end credits, but no it wasn't. Even my 8 year old cousin was not a fan of that song, he too thinks it lasts way too long.Now when it comes to Vivo. He's a cute little monkey, but he's unlikeable in some ways. He's very arrogant (for no reason too) when he first meets the little girl. I don't know if Vivo considers himself a musical prodigy just cos he worked with the Pedro Knight character all those years, but regardless I just don't think Vivo had to be a little prick for a good amount of the film. He's mean to the little girl, but she can't understand him. There's nothing funny about the way he puts the little girl down at first, you can tell his comments are suppose to serve as comic relief but it comes off as more mean than funny. Confusing too because Vivo is not the musical prodigy that he thinks himself to be. I assume Lin Manuel Miranda wrote this character with himself in mind as the one to bring him to life. I love Lin Manuel Miranda and I think he's great at storytelling through music, but he's not the greatest vocalist - he really just talks with style. So for this character to be written as an arrogant little punk while singing like that ? Yeah they should have humbled this character down - or to make it accurately match Miranda, have him be good at instruments and songwriting but not sing.The final scenes of the film, like where the Celia Cruz character sings the song the Pedro Knight character wrote for her is very nice. The mix of 3D and 2D animation made it feel like a storybook come to life and it's emotional to see the spirit of the Pedro Knight character show his gratitude to Vivo and the little girl. How we got to that point was a mix of fun and boring, but at the end of it all I did enjoy the film, despite it's major imperfections.I recommend this one because it's good for what it is, a family movie.",Vivo

The elements in the movie flows in a perfect way like rainbow from start to finish. The peformance of the characters and the never ending songs one after another keeps you engage all the time. Director Kirk DeMicco has done a fine job putting a bucket of emotions filled with joy and sorrow on the screen. The film has a continuous suspense that works both as an advantage and disadvantage. Audience keeps sitted on their seat but also sometimes they just wanna skip to the end skipping everything in the middle. In the end the presentation delivers a feel good ending filled with many emotions. Overall Vivo is a movie you definitely wanna watch on your day off or on the weekend with your whole family.

24,Clank_Zoka,"A Sweet and Charming Movie, Nothing More, Nothing Less",7,7 August 2021,"So, new Sony animated movie is here on Netflix with music by and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda and the trailers for this movie looked super duper promising!, which I am very excited about, looks bright, colourful and looks like it'll have super catchy songs!, this is also the first musical from Sony Pictures Animation, which makes this even movie excited!, Sony seems to be on a roll this year after the highly engaging Mitchells vs the Machines, so it came to Netflix yesterday and I watched it yesterday and..., it was pretty good, not a masterpiece nothing that is a high achievement for Sony but still sweet and has a good heart so let's talk about it.The story is simple but it works in a effective, the theme is about loss and also family, which this film handles in a very mature and I like that, the opening to this movie is fantastic and ends strong too, it also has some wonderful musical moments which lots of lively passion and big colours which I love, speaking of which the animation is stellar compared to the last film they released, it has lots of amazing detail, the characters almost have that Pixar quality especially the characters like Andrés, the characters are all uniquely designed and interesting, the backgrounds have great detail and capture the look of Cuba very well, the 2-D animation is also spectacular and kinda reminds me of Soul a little bit, the characters are fun and are charming especially the main character who is pretty cute and can bring in some good laughs, I like Andrés too who I thought should of been in the film longer but his screen presence was lovely and I also liked Marta too, voice acting is well done on everyone's behalf, Miranda does a good job as always, even Michael Rooker's small role is delightful and at least it was slightly longer then the Suicide Squad, Zoe Saldana also, everyone does great!, the music is delightful, most of the songs are catchy, highly memorable and fun!.However like I said, this movie is not perfect, the story is well told but goes by too quickly and feels rather short, which is a good thing in a way, but also feels like there could of been more potential if it was longer but it does get to the point in a nice way I suppose, Gabi is a bit annoying mostly but not awful, she is performed well and she identifies with Vivo in which they both have something in common, the comedy after the great opening didn't do much for me, I laughed maybe three times but nothing else does it besides being modern and kinda cringey, some characters appear and leave quickly which is a shame because some of them are kinda cool, also some of the songs although mixing traditional and modern quite well can be a bit too much and all over the place really, but hey the music generally is very good.So yeah, I liked the movie, I wish I loved but ehh, it could of been better, Vivo is a very charming, sweet, fun little family movie that has wonderful animation, great songs, charming characters, a wonderful opening and a beautiful ending, a good enough story with a nice heart to it and so decent comedy too, but despite how quick the film goes and gives little to other minor characters and comedy goes a bit cringey, especially to Gabi who isn't awful, some loud songs but not in a good way, so yeah not a perfect Sony animated movie like Mitchells vs the Machines but better then Wish Dragon at least, so give it a watch with the family of if you are a fan of Miranda work's then you'll get something out of it, I wish it was better but I did have a nice time with it at least!.I'll give Vivo a 7.8/10.",Vivo
25,scarlettwyrtzen,Eh,4,12 August 2021,"It was cool.Like, I loved the relationship between Vivo and Gabi but the animation was not original, THE VOCAL TRACKS WERE HEAVILY AUTO THNED EW!And honestly, it might be the worst piece of work Ive heard from Lin Manuel.",Vivo

29,andrewtisler,"Colorful animation, strong writing, fun characters, and catchy songs make ""Vivo"" a hit!",10,30 September 2021,"Recently this year, Sony Pictures Animation has been delivering some of the most spectacular animated features ever crafted, and ""Vivo"" is no exception. The colorful, vibrant animation that captures the feel of its Cuban beginning and Florida continuation, a well-directed story, some of the most fun characters that Sony Animation has crafted, and catchy songs make this a true feature worth watching!Vivo, the titular character, is a kinkajou living in Havana, Cuba with his elderly owner Andres, a street performer desperately wishing to reunite with his long-lost lover Marta, now the most popular singer in Miami, Florida. After his owner dies, Vivo is determined to get a love song Andres wrote for Marta to her by her next show. Along the way, he ends up teaming up with Andres' grand-niece Gabi, a misunderstood pre-teen who can rap. Together, they cross dangerous locations and encounter terrifying animals to get Marta to hear Andres' song. The story is briskly-paced, smartly written, and full of heartfelt moments, as well as some funny elements, too.Vivo's character arc is strong and full of depth, as well as lots of honest emotion. Gabi is almost like a human version of the titular kinkajou, and has a really cool gift of rapping, which makes her incredibly unique and fun to watch. Rosa is her mother, who desperately tries to get her to make friends in her girl scout troop the Sand Dollars. Andres is Vivo's late owner, with a high gift of music and love for Marta. Marta herself is a famous singer and Andres' old lover. There are also some spoonbills and a snake during the Everglades scene, and they are smaller characters than the rest, but still have an important impact on our titular hero's journey.The animation of ""Vivo"" is outstanding, with colorful visuals and a unique blend of 3D and 2D imagery. The animation itself compliments the musical numbers well in this movie, particularly ""Mambo Cabana"", ""My Own Drum"", and ""Grand Finale"".The music is enriching with Latin instrumentation, and reflects each emotion and character well. Also, as Sony Pictures Animation's first musical, ""Vivo"" has some very catchy songs. The songs also provide a lot of emotional depth and meaning, and tie in well to the film's message about accepting loss, love, change, and respecting people's interests.""Vivo"" has definitely set future standards for upcoming Sony Pictures Animation feature films, and has established the studio as a major field for musical movies as well as comedies, adventure fantasies, etc. Do check it out if you haven't already!",Vivo

The music in the film is diverse and fun throughout and I found myself tapping my feet to a few of the beats.Vivo is not a bad movie by any means. The animation is beautiful, the songs are great and the story is boring for adults.

Unfortunately, it didn't. To me, 'My Own Drum' was crazy amazing, but the song I waited to hear for so long 'Inside Your Heart' didn't meet expectations. Heck even 'One of a Kind' was good.I love the representation, having characters that are different from the usual ones we get to see, characters who you can relate to but aren't cliché. But even with such great individuals, character development was missing. There was so much more they could do! And as the plot progresses, it almost feels rushed and lacking.

This feels like a Disney movie in the fact that you have such a likeable character (yes I know it isn't a Disney film). Every scene has them moments that will make you cry or laugh. The story does it job and made for kids.The Bad- The story feels like we have seen this before and I feel like it should have done more to stand out from the crowd.Overall Thoughts- Vivo features one of the best soundtracks of the year and kids are going to love this. Overall I'm going to give 'Vivo' a 6/10.,Vivo

I dont understand the bad reviews or mixed reviews,the story is exactly: Vivo is a adopted animal and the guy who adopted him,is DIED,and girlfriend wants to do a show with him and vivo,but the guy who adopted vivo (i dont know the name of the guy who adopted him dont judge me)
he would like to give a music card,it was the chance of him before,but he didnt do... now Vivo is trying to give the cart of music to the girlfriend of the guy who adopted him (i dont know if his name is sanchéz or other name)

46,helaxious,Very dissapointing,2,11 August 2021,"It's very disappointing that Sony Animation already created amazing movies like Into The Spideverse and Mitchel vs The Machines, they seemed to understand that they shouldn't be making garbage movies like the infamous Emoji Movie, or like the Hotel Transylvania movies, and decided to finally show their true potential, sadly they don't seem to quite understand that yet.Vivo was very disappointing, I was expecting something very good from Sony, the movie has a very messy script, a second act filled to the brim with filler, for a movie that was celebrating Cuban culture, the rest of the movie after the first act taking place in a generic American city sure felt like a massive downgrade, some parts of the movie genuinely were hard to watch.A big portion of the movie was all about the songs, as far as I know they were composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, known for making Hamilton, they were pretty bad too, ranging from passable from awful, it's even more disappointing because the songs Lin Manuel composed for Hamilton were spectacularProbably my biggest let-down was the animation, my biggest compliments to Into The Spiderverse and Mitchel vs the Machines was the jaw-dropping animation, every single frame could be a wallpaper, it was experimental, it was new, it was bold, it was incredible. I had high hopes for the future of Sony, they dang knew how to make an animation style.So for their next movie to have a boring plain generic 3d style, with character designs ranging from Cuban caricatures to Boss Baby character design clones, with 5 minutes of """"experimental"""" animation, was very disappointing1 star out of 5, I would have given 1 star and a half if the movie wasn't made by Sony, I'm very disappointed.",Vivo

52,MoviePeek,Fresh and fun,8,18 October 2021,"Animation remains one of the most diverse, interesting, and ever-evolving genres the medium of film has to offer. Presenting stories for young and old to enjoy and be thrilled by, and with the unique ability to tell stories that live-action productions would never dare touch.Vivo marks Sony Pictures Animation's first musical animated feature film and tells the story of the cute and cuddly Vivo, a Kinkajou monkey with unique musical talents who sets off on a perilous journey to Miami to deliver a piece of music to the famed singer Marta Sandoval.Sony Pictures Animation is a little hit or miss with their offerings, creating everything from the critically acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and less enjoyable films such as The Emoji Movie. But that isn't the only obstacle Vivo had to overcome, as it was also released on Netflix, which is known the world over for many things, but their quality control is not one of them. It's fair to say that I had fairly low expectations going into Vivo; I had never heard of the film and simply stumbled upon it under Netflix's new releases section. With reckless abandon, I simply picked it and let the opening titles play...
It is my pleasure to report that I thoroughly enjoyed Vivo, and while it is unlikely to win an academy award or change your life, in the same way, a pacemaker or a lifetime supply of toilet paper would, it is a charming and surprisingly heartfelt journey that never misses a beat and offers entertainment for all the family. Like the best Disney films, Vivo features a soundtrack of emotionally charged plot-pushing, emotional explosions, that you can't help but tap your foot along to.Music is at the heart of Vivo's story and at the heart of the character himself, he may be a monkey, but he has the musical knack and can make a rhythm with almost anything he can find, he truly does have the music in him. His passion is infectious and the songs he performs throughout the film allow Vivo to express himself in a way that he simply never could of with words, giving the audience a deeper and more personal connection to him. However, Vivo isn't the only character that lights up the screen, in fact, the supporting players all provide plenty of laughs and feel three-dimensional. The standouts however for me have to be Andres, an elderly man who too has a deep and personal passion for music and is beloved by both Vivo and the entire town. In addition to Andre, there's Gabbi, a young girl whose musical sensibilities couldn't be more different from Vivo but shares common ground with him in other areas of her life.The stylized animation gives the film a Tom and Jerry manic energy at times, making the larger-than-life action scenes flow in an unrealistic but thrilling way. When making a film about a singing-dancing, drumming monkey it's probably a good idea to not try to innate reality and Vivo's visual style may not rival the very best Pixar offering but it's certainly no slouch. In addition to the computer-generated 3D animation, much to my surprise, the film also features sequences rendered in old-school 2D animation. These sequences integrate perfectly into the film and pop with amazing colours and feel as fresh and innovative as any 3D animated sequence does, they remain a highlight of the film and keep things fresh.Vivo's journey to deliver the song to Marta Sandoval takes him out of his comfort zone in small-town Cuba to the suburbs of Florida, he's a fish out of water, or in this case a monkey out of Cuba. Along the way he meets a handful of colourful characters, each with problems of their own, some become his allies while some are hell-bent on preventing him from continuing his journey. Without giving anything away, the middle of the film sees Vivo and Gabbi in an unexpected location, this detour provides some of their greatest challenges and some of the film's most emotionally charged and perilous moments.So, what's wrong with Vivo? Well, the truth is not much. Vivo doesn't attempt to change the game or evolve the genre like the very best masterpieces of animation do, and if you go into it with a cynical eye, I'm sure you will find problems. Its story could be called predictable, and its character arcs are by no means revolutionary. But let's all remember this is a film aimed at children about a singing monkey, I not saying adults won't enjoy it, in fact, I'm certain they will be pleasantly surprised. Vivo aims to tell a story about a lovable musical monkey on a journey to deliver a song, it's ambitions may not be as lofty as other animated films, but they don't always have to be. Vivo is a refreshingly simple story that offers a few surprises, tugs at your heartstring, and features plenty of laughs that will be enjoyed by the whole family and remains a pleasant surprise.",Vivo
53,komkommersalade,How many songs does one movie need?,4,11 August 2021,"Every time the plot seems to be going somewhere, they burst into horrendous song. The animations are quite nice, but this movie could do with a lot less singing, to at least create some room for character development.",Vivo
54,stuffkikker,'the Heights'; the cartoon,1,8 August 2021,"If you enjoyed The Heights, you might enjoy this. If you didn't because of the music, you won't enjoy this.I don't mind musical cartoons; I love Moana, Trolls (first one), Sing and plenty of Disney Classics. But what this Lin-Manual Miranda does with this hip-hop-telling-the-story-through-endless-and-repetitive-song-that-there-are-just-way-too-many-off doesn't work for me at all.And it is unfortunate, because from what I've seen, Sony Animation studios did a wonderful job once again. (From what I've seen, because for the first time in decades I couldn't actually finish this one, it was just too much). Great colorful backdrops and well crafted characters. The story-telling is very childish unfortunately; the way actors in theater for kids aren't actually trying to embody a persona, as much as they are just trying to be likeable and/or entertaining for the toddlers in front of them. I never felt like I was watching personalities and their struggles the way I would with say Moana. And the excessive singing is part of the problem there; everything just feels like setting the stage for the next song. A showcase. Not a story.",Vivo

We loved how Vivo's character interacted with his human co-stars even though they could not understand what he was saying. However, the audience watching and the other animal characters Vivo came across in the movie were able to understand Vivo's dialogue.

71,press-31193,"""Vivo"" - The Magic of the Mambo A Re-VIEW by Maria Elena Gutierrez",10,1 September 2021,"In Vivo, the animated musical adventure from Sony Pictures Animation and Netflix, a music-loving kinkajou called Vivo (Lin-Manuel Miranda) sets out to deliver a song written by his friend Andrés (Juan de Marcos González) to his long-lost love Marta (Gloria Estefan). Along the way, Vivo befriends an energetic young girl called Gabi (Ynairaly Simo) who helps him in his quest.The title Vivo - which also happens to be the name of the cute kinkajou hero - tells you everything you need to know about this film's intention. In Spanish, 'vivo' means 'alive,' and this is what this movie is all about. It is a celebration of life.Vivo's sense of life is expressed most powerfully through its use of music and dance. Together, these bring boundless energy and a powerful sensuality. Fueled by a cascade of original songs written by Miranda, this is not merely a musical - this is a film that is in every possible way about music.Riding on this glorious wave of music, and creating a thread that runs through Vivo from beginning to end, is the tender love story of Andrés and Marta. This story of two people who have grown old, yet who have stayed in love despite their separation, is timeless in its simplicity and, like everything else in Vivo, is at its most meaningful when expressed through music and dance.Take the uplifting Mambo Cabana, which Andrés sings as he tries to convince Vivo to let go of his fear and accompany him to Miami. When Andrés starts singing and moving to the rhythm of the mambo, he demonstrates the importance of dance and sensuality in Latin American culture, regardless of age. When you dance, you are ageless. When you fall in love, you are ageless. This idea is expressed beautifully in the song's repeating refrain, ""It's not too late,"" and supported visually when Andrés' collection of musical instruments starts glowing with a life of its own.Through the universal language of music, Vivo celebrates the whole of Latin American culture. But the music does not stop there. The rhythms of the mambo and salsa sprang from the Caribbean, from the hearts of the Black slaves who brought their music to the Americas, however, they are also heard in Florida in the United States, where the precocious Gabi dances to her own hip-hop beat - a style of music rooted just as deeply in the Black experience.Just as Vivo's journey transforms him from fearful kinkajou to brave hero, the music travels with him and is itself transformed, from Cuban mambo to streetwise hip-hop. Lin-Manuel Miranda's integration of these musical styles, which sound so different yet are so closely related, is masterful. Their relationship is expressed most clearly in the scenes where Vivo and Gabi make music together - a true collaboration of cultures.Gabi herself is filled with youthful energy, which forms a charming counterpoint to the film's underlying theme of love between elders. She even changes the visual language of the film, notably during her spectacular solo number ""My Own Drum."" Just like Katie, the protagonist of Sony Pictures Animation's previous animated feature The Mitchells vs. The Machines, Gabi gives the filmmakers license to fill the screen with vibrant imagery carefully designed to appeal to a younger audience.At the same time, Vivo recalls the earliest days of animation. The performances of the animated characters are driven directly by the music, just as they were in Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies or Max Fleischer's musically-inspired short films. The terrifying python Lutador owes an undeniable debt to Kaa from The Jungle Book, and the amorous spoonbills Dancarino and Valentina would not look out of place in a Disney feature from the 1940s.So, Vivo is a story of music and of life. It is a story about old age and youth, and about the things that connect them. Most of all, it is a story of love. The love that endures between Andrés and Marta, and especially the deep bond that exists between Vivo and Andrés. It is Vivo's love for Andreas that allows the kinkajou to overcome his fear and fulfill his mission. Their relationship is like that of father and son, or master and student, and the most beautiful songs in the film are those that speak of their profound love for each other. This love, of course, is expressed through music, as encapsulated by the unsung song that Vivo finally delivers to Marta, during the film's heartfelt climax in Miami.In the film's rousing finale - during which the whole cast sings the aptly titled ""Grande Finale"" - the familiar mambo rhythm returns in all its glory. Everyone dances, and what can we do as an audience except dance along, too? As a Latin American myself, I know I did. What choice did I have? I was taught to participate by dancing - it is an integral part of every Latin American person's cultural identity. Through dance, everyone becomes the protagonist. It is fundamental. In the end, we are all part of the dance.",Vivo

73,Maxio,Such a sweet movie!,9,8 August 2021,"What a sweet story this is. The animation is fine, the character design is a bit unusual, but the movie delivers. It's a simple straight story that takes you from A to B, but very much like LUCA it's a story about the love of a country - in this case Cuba - and making you feel happy. Since this is also a musical, it's packed with songs. I loved them all and so did my 8-year old. So, Netflix delivered. I am not a big fan of a rapping Lin-Manuel Miranda, but within this story it fits and it's very pleasing to the ears. I am hoping for more movies like this. We need more positivity in the world.",Vivo
74,ujuonyeka,No need for the harsh reviews #bekind,10,25 August 2021,A seriously great movie. Great to watch with the family and the animation is fantastic. Good story. 10/10.,Vivo
75,undertaleislife,It was...okay.,5,20 August 2021,"I wouldn't say I hated this movie, but I didn't like it. The plot was quite predictable that like oh Vivo the monkey is going to get the song to Maria at the end, which didn't make me that interested in the movie. After the death of that street singer who was in love with Maria (I can't remember his name), I felt disinterested because I knew that Vivo the monkey is gonna embark on a special journey to give the song to Maria that he never got to, but then there was a not-really-surprising twist where Gabi came in. In the slightest clean way I can put this, Gabi was slightly... Irritating to me to say the least, and I can't exactly pinpoint why. It could be the hair, it could be the not-so-good singing, I just can't point the one major flaw I see in her character. On the bright side, the animation was really good and the character design is stunning, so I'll give credit where needed.",Vivo

78,rune1973,I really enjoyed this film,10,22 August 2021,I put spoilers just in case it did have some.Even though i am not a kid anymore i still enjoy watching animation's and this one i liked It is sad and fun at same time and the end is good to and the songs are enjoyable and good to listen to as well.Defiantly good for kids to watch and parents alike especially if you like animations and musicals this is a good one for you.,Vivo
79,wudy-37264,great movie,10,10 August 2021,Liked all the music and it rare to have a animated movie make you tear up. Loved it.,Vivo
80,mofulous,Incredibly catchy and surprisingly bittersweet,9,23 September 2021,"2021 is just full of great animated movies that happen to appeal greatly to my tastes--and Vivo is one of them. Although the main characters are super cute, the film knows how to send a mature, emotional message about dealing with grief and loss. It really struck a chord in me and I couldn't stop thinking about it for several days. The voice acting is utterly fantastic, the songs are unforgettable, and the style is really endearing. There are a bunch of funny lines too, and all the characters are easy to love. The only major problem I could see is that not many events occur throughout the story. It's just a straightforward story with one minor sideplot and I feel as if more could have happened. But other than that, I believe this movie is definitely worth viewing and one you will remember for a long time to come.",Vivo
81,dfttnhvm,Pleasantly surprised,10,20 August 2021,"Wasn't in the mood for a musical but Vivo even though uses the tried and tested formula it still takes us on a wonderful journey with a couple of twists that make this an excellent movie to watch with family, kept us laughing for a good part of the movie, it's a must watch.",Vivo
82,meangorilla07,Why are adults so mad about this movie..? It's fantastic!!,10,31 August 2021,"30 year old mom here with 2 little kids. My kids and I LOVE this movie. I was originally interested because of Lin Manuel Miranda and his involvement. Then my kids got into it and now it's something we have to watch every day. The story is cute and yes - it's out there. It's a kids movie! It's meant to be a little goofy. Obviously some of the situations are unrealistic. Why do some people over-analyze movies like this? Just enjoy and have fun! Also, the songs in this movie are in my head 24/7... they're fun and catchy.",Vivo
83,la_rubiecita,I really wanted this to be good.,6,28 August 2021,"This is unfortunately not a great movie, even though I really wanted to like it. We were excited to find it on Netflix. Watched with my kids (10 & 6). The younger one got bored (just like me), the older one started to sigh every time a song commenced. The lyrics are, I don't know a nicer word for it, uninteresting. Also repetitive. They don't push the story forward, there's no point to them even though the whole story revolves around music. If you compare this to a movie like Soul, which is also musically driven, it's the difference between watching the Yankees at work vs watching the Pirates. The shirts are clean, the audience is there, hotdogs and beer aplenty and they play in the same league but... not really. The girls scouts were written by some misogynist. On the upside, the graphics are beautiful and I really sympathized with the old man for the first ten minutes. Give it a shot for your kids, but to adults I would say don't clear out your schedule for this.",Vivo
84,scoob-72405,Forgettable kids flick,1,6 August 2021,"Wasn't really impressed at all by this messy, forgettable and light kids animated movie. Maybe fun for young kids but wasn't really my favorite at all. Don't recommend this movie.",Vivo

88,alexpmercer5,Not the best,3,7 August 2021,The songs were flat and boring for the most part. The storyline was ok I thought. The animation was good. I feel they let themselves down with a musical animation on the music choices. The monkeys voice was just plane and flat.,Vivo

This kept them entertained all the way through, the songs had them up dancing too. A lovely story about friendship, love and loss. The song about dancing to your own beat was very catchy and the kids loved it.I read through some of the reviews afterwards and all the ones slating it really do go into depth about who's involved in the film, who's made it etc but if you don't really care about all that and just want a good, entertaining movie with the kids then this is a great watch!",Vivo
92,cla_1998-529-75820,Great music!,9,7 August 2021,My niece and I watched this after Space Jam to get ready for bed. Bad idea. It was so engaging and interactive. We danced and sang until the credits rolled. When we woke up the next morning... you got it ... she wanted to watch it again.,Vivo

95,danielkovacs,Couldn't finish,1,14 August 2021,Generally I like animation movies and most of these nowadays are meant for adults as well (or mostly for adults) but I felt so much cringe and awkwardness watching this that when the drum song came on I just had to turn it off right away.,Vivo

Lin Manuel Miranda's music is sensational. If my kids wanted to watch this 100 times, i wouldn't mind listening to it while i read a magazine or did dishes or something. But the characters and story aren't very engaging. Neither of my kids got sucked in, and i definitely did it. Its a simple story and moves real slow. Jokes are repetitive. I'm writing this review while watching it. Cuz its kinda boring. I'm pretty bored. Oh wait, another song, hold on... .... Oh, that was beautiful! Yeah, songs are amazing. Watch the movie once and then just listen to soundtrack. But that soundtrack... is sensational.",Vivo

98,erosyte,Such annoying characters,2,10 August 2021,"This is competing for the worst-written characters with frozen 2.They took the worst aspects of the Mitchells ( which fortunately has a lot more going for it) and made a main character out of them.The trailer and the start of the movie are promising, only to develop into a subpar buddy travel adventure with meh songs.Very underwhelming, was expecting more from the creators of spiderman and the Mitchells.Animation quality and art are obviously top notch, though.",Vivo
99,jprice-96081,Beautiful movie about love and loss,9,15 August 2021,"I am shocked that this movie has received 1 star reviews. The music was fantastic.

105,saoakman-1,Miranda's magic formula doesn't disappoint,9,11 August 2021,"100% typical Lin-Manuel Miranda. If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed--it's got a lot of ""In the Heights"", a good helping of ""Hamilton"", and a touch of ""Moana"" blended together into a Cubo-Floridian hero's journey. Sprinkle in some ""Up"", some ""Mean Girls"" and a ""Finding Nemo"" vibe.A great choice for family movie night, or for jaded middle aged men who need a good musical-inspired bawl at the end of a stressful day while hoping his wife doesn't notice...(or so I might imagine...no, not me at all).",Vivo
106,anotion,Deserves a higher rating than it has,9,29 August 2021,"It's full of heart. The story is decent. The music, singing, rapping and lyrics are excellent.

108,cfraz92,Oscar worthy music driven by a forgettable plot and no one should care.,9,28 October 2021,"Vivo isn't trying to be something its not. It succeeds in grabbing your children's attention while the music is welcome to live in adults' ears for days. The soundtrack honestly beats many of the best Disney movies. The animation is well done. The story was written around the music and it shows, but you have to hate music to let that bother you. Lin-Manuel Miranda is truly talented.",Vivo
109,oconnortf,"Initially was not sure what to think, then I watched it",9,8 August 2021,"I read other reviews after watching the film - I get some of the low scores - If you are all into Disney Pixar flavor this may not be up your alley. If you found Hamilton annoying because the song lyrics and interspersed slang made it hard to understand... again this may not be for you. Not my favorite animation style, but certainly not as unfinished as many animation releases are these days - But for many this will be amazing.- and most of the songs are fast paced energetic and fun - Very VERY reminiscent of the tempo and feeling of Lin-Manuel Mirandas songs in the smash Broadway hit Hamilton. So even people who do not normally line Animation, but loved that type of music will enjoy this.",Vivo

And that is the problem in my opinion.The characters them selves are OK, but it's the emotional journeys that they take and their arcs is what really brings this down. It feels like somebody wrote how the character starts and their journey ends, but then didn't tell that to the person who was writing everything in between, and by the time they realized that the parts didn't match they just shoved it all together in hopes that nobody would notice... So the conclusions that the characters come to have almost no build up, they just decided to change their opinion due to a seemingly unrelated events!",Vivo

117,chuckefarrow,Authentically Satisfying,10,18 August 2021,"As a Cuban-American, it was refreshing to see an animation studio tackle this cultural context for a story. More importantly, they managed to weave a heartwarming and entertaining story into this context without being offensive. Additionally, the music was on point with a breadth of Latin/x performers to satisfy different generations. Lastly, the casting was brilliant. I seriously don't understand the negative reviews. Watch it and enjoy.",Vivo
118,kekleks,Sony Pictures Animation has done it again (surprisingly),10,11 August 2021,"2021 has been a wonderful year for Sony Pictures Animation. First Mitchells, then Wish Dragon, and now Vivo.This movie is way more entertaining than I thought it would be. At first I wanted to see it specifically because of Lin-Manuel Miranda. But when I started the movie and simply just saw the intro, I knew I was in for a good movie. The music is fantastic, one of the best musical scores in my opinion. Wonderful songs and exemplary composition from the legend itself. A wonderful blend of different music genres and beautiful rhythm = great songs.When it comes to characters I'd say that they are definitely like-able. Are they perfect, unique, characters? Some yes, some no, but the movie still delivers each character really well. Some characters feel like they were there to advance the plot, like the sand dollar girls, but that's just my opinion.Voice acting is well done. You can tell the cast was professionally picked, and they didn't just throw in famous names to make the movie more popular. Each character had a perfect voice actor. I personally like Vivo and Andres.The story is not unique, it's rather basic; yet it's not bad. The story fits the movie, and it's not overpowering either. Everything flows well (sometimes a little too well because of plot armor) and makes sense in a weird way. It's still subject to movie logic and plot holes (I won't give spoilers so you can find out for yourself), but it still feels natural in a way.The animation is absolutely stellar. It feels stretchy, bendy, cartoony and rubberhose-esque; while at the same time not depending completely on that style. It's not no Spider-Man: into the spiderverse or Mitchells versus the Machines, but it's still enjoyable and can stand on its own. It feels like a Sony Pictures Animation movie while at the same giving off a different vibe.If I were to rate the movie separately I'd rate it:
Music: 10
Story: 7
Characters: 8
Animation: 10All in all, it's a really great movie. It is definitely worth a watch.",Vivo

It had a little Princess and the Frog vibe in that they were on a chaotic journey with talking critters interacting with humans. I liked the original storyline and I liked the casting choices. I liked Gloria Estefan and who ever styled her character was genius.I REALLY don't understand all the one-star ratings. I mean it was no Attack of the Killer Tomatoes for heaven's sake. Those 1-stars are a little suspect. I would have given this 7.5 stars but I'm giving it 9 to counter those ridiculous 1's.It was in no way the worst animated film ever which is what a one-star would rate.

137,mirandalaico,"Yeah...No, definitely no!",1,7 August 2021,"Vivo it's a movie that feels rush, in everyway: in terms of production, story, characters, everything, and not only that, it has a LOT of plot holes.In less than 10 minutes we are introduce to the characters and because they really love music that's the only way that we can tell that this friendship between Vivo and Andres has been going on for a while, because in those 10 minutes we only see when they met, and nothing else from them, we see Andres and Marta's love story as he tell this to Vivo for the first time, and suddenly in the same day, and in the same minutes, the old man dies. I'm not saying it's impossible, but the story need it to happen soon, they kill the man that owns Vivo that we can hardly get to connect and they barely show him again.Then we are introduce to Gabi, maybe this is personal, but I don't like her, they made her this really outcast but funny and full of weird modern music character that I feel that I'm not in front of a real person with a personally, I know it's an animated movie and it's not about showing the world as it is, but the character ends up being annoying, I hate the song where she sings about... Well, I don't remember, the weird combination of music makes you forget about what you are hearing and make you concentrate on how weird and how 'musically weird' is.Then the cookie girls, those are characters that are rush into the story, because they are the bad guys for 15 minutes and then when Vivo saves them from a piton (are there pitons in Miami??) they suddenly have a change of heart. They take Gabi and Vivo to the concert and that's it, we never see them again, except for the finale sequence. They weren't needed!!And when Vivo is rewriting the song with Gabi, athey made us think that the protagonists would sing together with Marta in her concert, but nooo. And also it took them three quarters of the movie to get to Marta and, it's that simple of a sequence? I mean the parts that Vivo gives her the letter and the song in the Mambo Cabana.But the thing I'm trying to explain it's that not only the plot feels rush, the production of this movie felt rush! You can tell by watching the movie, that's fuuull of plot holes! In less that 10 minutes we are introduce to at least 4 things that are important to the story (I'm not saying it because it's hard to remember but it's because, couldn't Sony Animation Studios, the same that brought you The Mitchells, which is a masterpiece, extend this things to at least 20 minutes so we can connect with the characters instead of giving everything at once???). And also, in the movie is said that Andres and Vivo are a beautiful music duo, and when they are singing in the plaza the directors makes us think that Vivo can be heard by everyone, but then no, he speaks like a monkey, normally. But then what the hell did the people hear when we was singing?? Natural monkey sounds? This is not explain, naturally but this is a plot hole that is in the entire movie, not in one sequence.Later, in less than a day, Vivo can: let go of his best friend's death mostly and become friends with Gabi, even though that he didn't like her because of her modern music, but when she builds a boat out of trash, he thinks 'it's not so bad', this is weird and rush, don't tell me that you don't see it. And then when Vivo can't open the door to Gabi in the concert, the movie make us think that is this big separation and it's so sad that Gabi can't go on with Vivo and give the song to Marta, but then, less than 5 minutes later, they are reunited... You can call me cold hearted or whatever, I'm not really, I love to cry in emotional movies, but this one doesn't know how to put an emotional moment correctly! You have to give the characters depth in their stories and personalities and later give time so when they are reunited we can really feel happy about them, this movie does not know how to be good, or instead Sony wanted a movie so they made one in 6 months, the animation it's not so good also, so you can tell by that.They rush everything into one hour and forty minutes for some reason, if you are going to make an animated movie, make it good! Cuba has a lot of things to show, but of course, half of the movie had to take place in Miami, luckily we got Latin Americans so we can finally get a representation, but this one, it's just bad. And can we quickly talk about how the cookie girls where no use to the plot? And their appearance is 10 minutes long?! The only reason they where useful is because the story needed a bad guys (it really didn't though) and a boat so the protagonists could get where they needed to. How could they even drive a boat and be alone in place full of deadly animals (like the piton or crocodiles), another thing that was just used for the sake of the plot moving forward, in terrible ways. Probably the producers at Sony watched the Encanto trailer and said 'We got to beat the competition, let's make a movie about Latinos!' and then another said 'That sounds great! But we don't have the time...' and the first one said ' doesn't matter! We'll cast Lin Manuel Miranda and people will come!' and so they did, but what a waste of his potential it was.The only reason I'm giving it a one it's because the only scene I like it's the song at the end, and because the movie was finally over.I wouldn't recommend this movie, if you are a Miranda's fan, you can watch it, it's a waste of time though, but he sings really good.",Vivo
138,krisssi-83927,Great movie with wonderful songs!,10,15 August 2021,This is one of the funniest and adorable movies that I have seen lately and the songs are and dances are amazing!It's worth to see it!,Vivo

141,kaydenatrab,Decent story but good music,6,7 August 2021,"As usual, films starring lin Manuel Miranda always have very good music. The story is decent, a bit sad, the animation is pretty good and in my opinion this film is getting a little bit underated because the suicide squad that airs on HBO max at the same time as vivo airs on Netflix.

145,emberyt,This was a movie that exists.,4,15 August 2021,"It's not good and it's not bad, it's just kind of there. If you want something to entertain your young kids? Watch it. If you're watching for a meaningful film experience? Skip it.Side note I wish the main character didn't talk. Geniunely, this movie would've been so much better if Vivo expressed himself through character movement and MUSIC rather than talking. The dialogue between him and the human characters is always awkward because in the back of your head you're always thinking ""They can't understand a thing he's saying right now.""Also had a weird outlook on environmental protection? If I saw a scene kid 8 year old running around with an endangered species I would be concerned too.",Vivo
146,nogreenergrass,Lmm,8,6 August 2021,"If you are a Lin Manuel Miranda or Pixar fan you will love this movie. It gives off strong In the Heights, Luca, Soul, Up, and Coco vibes. If you are a fan of Lin you will be surprised.",Vivo

From the streets of Cuba an elderly man and his monkey as street performers until something sad happens and that's when the adventure begins. Full of excitement and amazing music! The colors were vibrant and being from Florida it was cool to see them bring in some native animals like the roseate spoonbill. The cartoon musical with the talents of the man who brought you Hamilton. I didn't expect to love it so much but I loved every second of this film. If anybody has anything bad to say I would highly question their taste.",Vivo

It had potential, though. As an animator with a vast knowledge of animated films, I found this one to be misused (the old man's character was the most interesting throughout the entire film, and after his death I felt the great need for a character to fill his lack).The humor was boring, something even my 11-year-old daughter noticed, and the rest of the characters were really annoying.Unfortunately, a cute monkey doesn't make the movie go up a few points. It's sad, given the masterpieces that have already come out this year.",Vivo
170,marshallalfiegeorge,I loved it!,8,17 August 2021,"I already wrote a very long review but accidentally deleted it all! So I'm just gonna say that Vivo is a modern musical classic, do not expect a Disney musical though, this couldn't be anymore different!",Vivo
171,claybyderek,Bad reviews by Disney fans or trolls,10,18 August 2021,"Giving this movie a 10/10 because of all the bad reviews. I do not understand the 1 ratings, even the worst movie I've watched isn't even a 1.I would recommend this movie to anyone, you don't even have to have kids to enjoy it. It's a movie about love, music and Cuba. I get it not everyone in Cuba speaks English. Who cares, it was very cute and adorable. The sequence with the birds was a bit much but I enjoyed it regardless. It's nice to have something else than Disney movies.For the people asking why Sony animation keeps making these films (not that there is anything wrong with this one) when they did Spider verse & Mitches it's because movies like Angry Birds and Hotel Transylvania make money. Spider verse regardless of winning and Oscar did very poorly at the box office. I don't understand the trolls making it about Disney, this movie isn't a competition, it's entertainment.I'm glad to get anything from Sony, Ilumination and even Dreamworks. Sadly Pixar is getting swept under by Disney as well.In a couple of months Encanto will be out, which will be by the same creator as Vivo, both movies written by Lin Miranda, I would like to see the reviews on that one because I've heard they are pretty similar. Want to see how the Disney trolls rate that one, is it going to be a masterpiece or a 1 star movie as well?I can go on and on as IMDB lets anyone write a review, and I can see all the new accounts created just to leave a 1 * review, (c'mon guys) but all I can say is that this movie isn't perfect, but it's great and I will rewatch over and over. The songs have me hooked, I found myself singing them all day. Give it a try, don't read the bad reviews.We gotta support these other animation companies, at one point Disney will buy everything and the only thing we will get is PG rated content. I can already see it with Deadpool. And for all the Latin users who are complaining, be glad we are getting some Latin content, at Least Sony animation did not try to patent a national cultural holiday like Disney did with Coco, Stop trolling and support other companies.Vivo is great, and Lin Miranda rocks. I will watch anything that man makes.",Vivo

Lin Manuel's musical talent is incredible. The animation is gorgeous and vibrant and makes me want to go to Cuba and Florida. The rich timber of Juan de Marcos' voice is stunning. Great casting. Love that Gloria Estefan is in it too. I love that there's no violence, guns or fighting, only two snake scenes that could be a tiny bit frightening for younger kids. A brilliant family movie suitable for toddlers through to adults. This movie and the soundtrack have become favourites in our household.",Vivo
178,acrocantheia,Super cute,10,26 August 2021,The animation is bright and colorful and stylized perfectly for such an upbeat and fresh story!I adored the beat of every song and found myself dancing in my seat!Super cute movie that will make you cry a few times.,Vivo

180,adisgorgonzola,A true musical masterpiece,10,5 September 2021,"It's rare that I feel the need to review something, but whilst watching Vivo and checking out the cast on IMDB I saw the bad reviews and I can't understand why. Vivo is a beautiful movie, full of well written characters, brilliant original music and stellar performances all round. It deals with mature themes such as love, loss, grief and individualism in such a vibrant and charismatic fashion and in one moment you might be crying and the next your toe tapping to another absolute banger. This in my opinion is one of the best animated movies of the last few years. Don't let the low scores put you off, Vivo is wonderful and not to be missed.",Vivo
181,nayounlee,Created IMDb account to review Vivo--totally blown away by the story and music,10,6 September 2021,"When my 5-year-old asked to watch it on Netflix, I thought it was one of those episode/season-based cartoons. Then, as we watched on, I was like wait...the quality of the motion, story, and music was too advanced to be one of those regular cartoons on Netflix.Anyway, here I am creating an account on IMDb just to review this animation piece because it deserves a much higher rating than 6.7. Come on, this is injustice to rate it so low.. As someone who grew up on Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin (in my 40s now), and force feeds these classics to my young daughter, I honestly don't feel 100% fulfilled by the Frozen and Raya line of Disney animations (I don't dislike them but something about the storyline and scene transitions are not up to par with those of the Disney Renaissance pieces).I am impressed with Vivo because it gets the ""basics""/""foundations"" right of what makes a good animation.1. Strong storyline: ""new,"" ""original/novel,"" or ""unexpected"" storylines are not necessarily what make an animation great. None of the Disney classics were original in story (e.g., Snow White, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, list goes on) but it was the adaptation and screenwriting that made them unique. I disagree with reviewers who rate Vivo down for lack of originality or ""offering few surprises."" In fact, Vivo's story is quite unique in that the main ""love"" interests are between two seniors (one deceased) and between a deceased father and daughter. The underlying theme/life lesson goes beyond superficiality, too, as it is about obtaining closure after death of a loved one and the lingering regret of the living of not having told the person how much they meant to them while they had the chance. I think Vivo is the type of movie whose effect is greater--creating ripples of emotions inside you--after the movie has ended. Kind of like Pixar's ""Soul"" with a stronger ending (personally I prefer animations that give me closure, too, lol).Oh, and I love the depiction of Cuban culture in the film. Diversity in animations is so important as it helps young minority children see themselves and others and understand the importance of different cultures and languages. My daughter, who is Asian, was genuinely curious about a lot of things depicted in the film and we had such a great educational conversation thanks to Vivo---which means diversity in film works.2. Well-developed characters that you grow to like and relate: I confess that Vivo and Gabby did not initially look ""attractive"" or ""interesting."" I just clicked on the movie for my kindergartener and did not expect much. Thought it was going to be one of those visually-busy but mentally-unstimulating animations. However, I was surprised at how the more I watched the more I gradually ""grew"" to like Vivo and Gabby and understand how Gabby was just a tender-hearted 10-year-old who's still processing the death of her father. All the other characters are likable, too, and not overbearing. Love Andres, Rosa, Marta, and even Becky and the busdriver.3. Excellent scene transitions: I cannot stress how important this is because today's animations are pathetically lacking in this quality. Even Frozen and Raya miss the subtleties in transition that differentiate the great from the good. While Disney's most recent animations are fun to watch and I still like their music, the quality of the storyline and that of story transitions have gone down quite a bit. Due to the poor transitions and story development, there is no lingering deep emotions/inspirations after the movie is over. I think many of the current hits in animation echo the same problems with Hollywood movies these days-- scene-to-scene story transitions are awfully awkward and implausible but there is a lot of surprising visual effects that can be pleasing to the eye.4. Yes, of course the music!: Lin-Manuel Miranda has done it again. Both my daughter and I are hooked on to the songs in Vivo and have been replaying the movie four times already. Yes, it can sound like Hamilton but the songs have a unifying theme of ""you and me"" as Vivo's relationship with Andres is coming to a close and moving onto a new one with Gabby. I find the similarities in tune/rhythm pleasing as they are like Miranda's signature--very catchy but not superficial/light as they all convey deeper meaning about human connections. Vivo knows when to develop the storyline and when to insert music--again, transitions are key.All in all, my score is 10/10 because Vivo is ""refreshingly"" loyal to the basics and foundations of what makes a movie good--lasting good.",Vivo

The songs are undeniably Hamilton'esque overlaid with Cuban and edgy modern vibes.

I did enjoy a few of them, however Gabi's song was SO annoyingly BAD. I absolutely hated how loud and obnoxious she came off and it shined through in this song. The song was also weird and didn't seem to really fit, with I guess makes sense because Gabi doesn't really fit herself. I'm sure a kid could bop to it though! Also Vivo looks a lot like a monkey. Kinkajous are said to look like a cross between a racoon and monkey, but maybe they could've made him look more......kinkajou-like? I dunno. He's cute though so it's cool.",Vivo

202,bdknight5,A musical colorful marvel with a touching story!,10,11 August 2021,"A feast to the eyes and ears! I can't remember when was the last time a kids' movie made me cry. It reminded me again to live without regrets, always expressing my love and appreciation to my loved ones! I danced and laughed and cried! And listening to Gloria Estefan sing in the roll of Marta was so touching! Awesome movie for big and small!",Vivo
203,caulkblocked,Enjoyable Film,8,7 August 2021,"It will tug at your heart while making you tap your toes and sing along. Fun film that has good humor (even for adults), a great story about being true to yourself. Some mentioned CRT, there is none in this movie. The songs are fun tho can be a little too much LMM at times. Gabi is a cute character that beats to her own drum and doesn't need other approval. She's a strong role model for the kid that might feel a little out of place. Overall, good movie.",Vivo
204,annastuckey,Good family movie night movie,10,9 August 2021,"Great music and endearing storyline. This is a good one for all ages. My kid loved it, my mom and I enjoyed as well. We have already watched it twice.",Vivo

beautifully with catchy songs. Lin-Manuel
Miranda is a master. And Gloria Estefan, what a voice. Nostalgia take-over.",Vivo
206,wackyracoon,"Kid is right, parent is wrong.",3,14 August 2021,"Just another movie to brainwash your kid into rebelling against you when they get older. Typical Disney plot, the parent tells the kid something, kid does opposite, parent sees the kid was right.",Vivo
207,aimeedgarcia14,Fun and Very Touching,9,14 August 2021,"First off, I am a huge Lin Manuel Miranda fan. Let's just get that out of the way. I totally enjoyed the movie, especially Gabi. She was
exactly what the story needed. She's inspiring and I wish everyone were like her. The songs are incredible and really catchy which is not surprising given that it was LMM who wrote them. Overall, the movie is amazing!",Vivo

211,malva-10073,loved it,9,7 August 2021,Liked the story line and loved the characters voices. The beautiful songs kept me engaged with the colorful animation. It had its sad part tugged at my heart and funny parts. Great to see the Cuban and American life with having the music in common. Really enjoyed Gabi's catchy rap song.,Vivo

216,cynthiabirt,Cute but predictable,7,9 August 2021,"Like most movies these days the plot and storyline is of course rather predictable,but it's a cute movie. The cast was very well chosen and the music and songs are quite catchy which makes the movie more engaging. Had the music not been apart of it I probably would have been bored. Give it a shot! Watch it for yourself and form your own option of it. It's not going to take everyone by fancy, but for me I liked it!",Vivo
217,sammi4-1,Wonderful and Sweet,10,16 September 2021,"Loved this little movie.. Found it by accident, but I am so glad I did. Lin-Manuel Miranda has done it again! The music was so catchy and the story was perfect. I recommend it highly!",Vivo

219,ryan-87817,A Musical Extravaganza,10,24 August 2021,"(Disclaimer: This review was originally a script for my Youtube channel before my change of plans; most of my future reviews will not read out like this. Keep this in mind as you are reading).Vivo, played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is a Cuban kinkajou who lives with Andres, played by Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, a musician who makes a living by performing musical acts alongside Vivo in a plaza. One day, the two receive a letter from Andres' former love interest Marta Sandoval, played by Gloria Estefan, informing them that she has decided to retire from her own career as a musician.Andres, having written a song just for her at one point, realizes that this is his chance to show how much he truly loves her, and all he has to do is travel to Miami and meet up with her there at her farewell concert. However, due to circumstances far beyond his control, Andres is unable to make the journey himself, so Vivo decides to do it for him.Vivo's journey from Cuba to Miami is very intense, immersing the viewer in a fun-filled adventure full of surprises and wonders. You never quite know what is going to happen next, and that only makes the experience that much more exciting. The writing, while not always top-tier, accompanies the feature extremely well, giving the viewer some memorable lines to look back on.The characters are easily the most important part of the entire feature. Vivo is the loyal kinkajou who just wants to support his partner in the best way he can, and Andres is the loyal father figure who rescued Vivo when he was just a baby and has continued to take care of him ever since. He's not in the film for too long, but his presence in the film does trigger the main storyline.As it turns out, Vivo is not alone on his journey to Miami. Throughout most of his journey, he is accompanied by a young aspiring musician named Gabi, played by child actress Ynairaly Simo. She is very passionate about Vivo, and is more than willing to help him get to Miami. However, since she is only a child, she has to worry about her mother Rosa, played by Zoe Saldana, getting in the way of things.Rosa doesn't appear too much in the film, however, so the movie contains other minor antagonists that try to stop the heroes from making their journey to Miami, including a girl scout troop obsessed with wildlife preservation, an anaconda played by Micheal Rooker that wreaks havok at various points in the film, and security guards for when Vivo and Gabi finally make it to Miami. They may not play a very important role in the feature by themselves, but when all combined, they can create a great challenge for our main protagonists.The voice acting is also stellar in this film. I especially like the variety in the voice cast, and how they are not all just Caucasians as is sadly the case in many movies both nowadays and in the past. It adds a nice touch to the feature that gives it its own flare. In fact, my only problem with it is that, much like with Chris Pratt in the Tomorrow War, Lin-Manuel is so recognizable that his performance can almost be distracting at times, though much like in that movie, it's not a very big issue at all.The animation in this movie is something to Marvel at (no pun intended, but I will be getting back to it soon, don't worry), especially when you take into consideration the different animation styles and vibrant colors the movie gives off. You have no idea how rare traditional animation is in mainstream animated movies these days, so whenever it does show up, even if only for brief moments at a time, it is a sight to behold.As expected for any musical involving Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical sequences in this movie are beyond phenomenal, and whenever they appear in the film, they absolutely do not disappoint one bit. Each song in the movie gives the viewer a unique experience that will stay with them for a long time after the film has concluded, especially when it's Lin-Manuel that's doing the singing.Overall, Vivo is a fantastically-done masterpiece that utilizes the best aspects of every idea it incorporates to the fullest extent it possibly can. Moving forward, you will find that the musical is among my absolute favorite film genres, and it was an absolute pleasure reviewing one for this channel, even if there are more to come. To no one's surprise, I highly recommend this movie to everyone watching this review, so that all of you can enjoy the magic that Vivo has in store.Breakdown:Story- 10

Enjoyment- 9
Impact- 10Overall Score- 93/100.For Future Notice (Ignore if you didn't come here from my Youtube Channel): I will continue to break down movies as I review them in the way I have done it here and before, unless they are documentaries, anthologies (for example, if I ever decide to review the WDAS films, Fantasia, its sequel, and the package films will not be broken down), and any other film that does not follow the traditional narrative structure, but they will still receive a star rating of 1-10 stars. Speaking of which, just to make things easier, the tens digit of the overall score will be added by 1 to get the star rating for films that are broken down (for example, films with an overall score between the 0 and 9 range will score a 1/10, 10-19 will be 2/10, 20-29 will be 3/10, and so on until 90-100, which will be 10/10 such as this).",Vivo
