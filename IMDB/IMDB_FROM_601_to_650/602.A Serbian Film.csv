0,Leofwine_draca,Depraved,1,11 November 2018,"Many films nowadays claim to be the ""most shocking ever"" and A SERBIAN FILM is such a movie; it only exists in order to offend, but sadly it has nothing to go along with the offensive scenes. It's a cheap, ugly-looking independent production about an ageing porn star who gets coerced into shooting a new movie, but he finds his life spiralling out of control. There's absolutely nothing to recommend about this unpleasant film; scenes of hinted child abuse and the like are supposed to be edgy and shocking, but they're staged in such a ridiculous fashion that they'll have no traumatic effect on any viewer.",A Serbian Film
1,claudio_carvalho,Censorship is the Best Marketing,7,24 July 2011,"In Serbia, the retired porn star Milos (Srdjan Todorovic) is married with his beloved wife Marija (Jelena Gavrilovic) and they have a little son, Peter, that is their pride and joy. The family is facing financial difficulties, but out of the blue, Milos is contacted by the porn actress Lejla (Katarina Zutic) that offers him a job opportunity in an art film. Milos is introduced to the director Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic) that offers a millionaire contract to Milos to act in a film. However, Vukmir neither show the screenplay nor tell the story to Milos. Milos discuss the proposal with Marija and he signs the contract. But sooner he finds that Vukmir and his crew are involved in sick snuff films of pedophilia, necrophilia and torture and there is no way back to him and maybe it is too late to protect his family. Yesterday, the exhibition of ""A Serbian Film"" was forbidden in the RioFan Festival by the promoters that claimed in a note that ""We deeply regret the decision. ""A Serbian Film"" is, without any doubt, one of the most polemic films of all times etc."" These were the magic words that made me see this film.First of all, I am against any censorship: a film shall be accordingly rated, with warning advising the theme since only very specific audiences might like it. My wife, for example, is a very sensitive person and would never support watching ""A Serbian Film"".This film is indeed sick, violent, polemic, with many transgressions; but ""Irréversible""; ""Salò o le 120 Giornate di Sodoma""; ""Hostel""; ""Ichi, the Killer""; ""Cannibal Holocaust""; ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (the original) and many others also are and they have their public and fans.""A Serbian Film"" is one of the most violent, sick and graphic films that I have ever seen, but I liked it. The sequence with the baby is unbearable and hard to see; the scene with Milo's family is too violent and disturbing but absolutely predictable. The acting and make-up are impressively realistic. Certainly a sensitive person will be sick and will not like or even see this movie. The poster in the movie-theaters and the boxes of the DVD or Blu-Ray should warn that this story is recommended to a very specific audience; but censorship, never, since it is the best marketing that a polemic film can have. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Serbian Film – Terror Sem Limites"" (""A Serbian Film – Terror without Limits"")",A Serbian Film
2,kosmasp,Controversy abound,8,17 July 2015,"There's movies where it doesn't even matter what you'll write about them. Just your vote will be enough to get people on your ""side"" or against you. This movie is notorious already, especially for one scene. A scene that is vivid at first, but is not explicit through the act that is most despicable. That doesn't make the scene any less vicious or disturbing, quite the opposite.But if the goal of the movie was to create a reaction, it achieved its goal. If it tried to comment on society, some might argue it failed. Even those who can see what the movie is trying to tell us. The question is not only, if you can stomach what you see. It's also can you work with that? While there is a lot of intercourse (mostly violent, absurdly you could argue that the porn movie scenes are those that are ""normal"", while they are also the least explicit in the way they are shown to us), this movie is not aimed at ""joy"" or anything similar to that.There are many layers, everything is being sexualized, being unable to feel anything, family values, numbness, a society who needs ""more"" than what could be considered normal. You could say that it not only sheds light on the situation in Serbia, but also shows people a mirror. It's a movie in a movie, showing us where Horror or movies move in general.While I do realize that some might think I might be thinking too much and seeing things that are not there, I do believe that the filmmaker behind this had some of this things in the back of his head while doing the movie. It's the way a movie is shot and presented, that makes you think that. Again: The movie is disturbing to say the least and maybe some might think you didn't need all the nudity and violence to get the point across ...I'm not going to tell people to watch this or what they should think about it. A good friend of mine actually took the disc after he watched it and destroyed it, because he was furious about what he had just seen ... This is tough and only you'll be able to judge for yourself ... the notoriety is well deserved though",A Serbian Film
3,BA_Harrison,Lives up to the hype as one helluva messed up film.,8,16 July 2010,"If you're inured to the excessive imagery of ultra-gore, numb to the sights and sounds of the August Undergrounds, can no longer get your kicks from Italian cannibal flicks, and find German necrophilia and Japanese tentacle porn all a big yawn, then get your grubby mitts on Serbian Film, a delightfully deviant slice of extreme cinema from Eastern Europe that takes bad taste to a new all time low by depicting acts of depravity you never thought could, or would, ever be committed to film.Srdjan Todorovic plays well-hung porn star Milos who has given up his lucrative (and presumably highly enjoyable) career in the adult film industry to settle down with his beautiful wife and young son. Cash is tight, however, so when Milos is offered a huge sum of money by creepy artist/director Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic) to star in an experimental art-house porno, he can't afford to say no, despite being kept in the dark about what it is he will be required to do.Now I'm not about to spoil the fun for you by revealing too many details about what poor Milos has to endure, suffice to say that it's all extremely unpleasant, involves plenty of sex and violence, and will no doubt prove highly offensive to the majority of 'normal' movie fans.The thing that really surprised me about this movie, however, is not the abhorrent subject matter (I was expecting it to be nasty), but rather the high quality of the product: shot on 35mm film, Serbian Film doesn't possess the grainy lo-fi appearance one might expect, but rather the polished aesthetic of a skillfully shot art-house production. Furthermore, director Srdjan Spasojevic (phew! I'm glad I'm only having to type these names, and not say them) displays a proficiency behind the lens uncommon in the majority of shock films and his cast is also surprisingly talented, their powerful performances lending the film a much needed sense of realism—at least until things get really bizarre.Once our hapless protagonist has been pumped full of speed and bull Viagra (watch the film to find out why—worryingly, it all makes sense), the film reaches a whole new level of 'wrong' which might have those viewers who haven't already switched off in disgust chuckling nervously at the sheer absurdity of what they are viewing, although a thoroughly downbeat ending that shows our hero and his family unable to escape their terrible nightmarish situation, even after death, soon puts a stop to any giggling!The makers of this film have apparently tried to defend their work from naysayers and haters by claiming that it is representative of the frustration and pain of living in Serbia. Personally, I don't believe a word of it but really don't care: I enjoyed and applaud Serbian Film for simply being one of the most daring viewing experiences in recent years.",A Serbian Film
4,Coventry,They want us to think all East-Europians are sick and twisted perverts?!?,5,25 April 2010,"""A Serbian Film"" played at the Brussels Festival of Fantastic Film, and I simply had to watch it because it came with all kind of warnings like ""this movie contains extremely violent scenes that might shock some people."" Okay, usually I'm not the least bit impressed by this sort of clever tricks to lure more people to the theater, but in this case it must have some kind of significance, because the regulars at this festival are quite used to seeing extreme bloodshed, perversity and madness. If the organizers of this particular festival felt there was a necessity to provide additional warnings to this crowd of loyal genre fanatics, than this must be an exceptionally shocking film. And it is  Well, let's just say there are certain sequences that are too revolting for words, but naturally the film itself is nothing extraordinary or even half-decent viewing material. The explicit pornographic footage is shocking merely for the sake of shocking and the most controversial sequences (one involving a newborn baby) are totally redundant and have absolutely no adding value. Personally, I'm having difficulties understanding what exactly the makers of ""A Serbian Film""wanted to accomplish here. Thanks to films like ""Hostel"", half of the world already thinks that East-European countries are rotten places and that all the people living there are sick and violent psychopaths. With this film, writers Aleksander Radivojevic and Srdjan Spasojevic only seem to confirm and intensify this sordid reputation like they are proud of living in a country the rest of the world thinks is a hellhole. Both gentlemen were present at the Brussels Festival to promote their film to die-hard cult audiences and naturally they were asked why they felt the need to make such a heinous and disturbing movie. They replied that the movie contains a massive amount of frustrations that are irrevocably linked to living in Serbia, like continuous economic recession, post-Yugoslavian war traumas and political instability. Okay, I can relate to that, but is shooting a brutal and vicious pseudo-snuff film really the right way to process this oppressed anger?The story introduces retired and literally hung-like-a-horse porn star Milos. He's worried about not being able to support his wife and son these days, but then he receives an offer he can't refuse. The sleazy Vukmir wants Milos to play the lead part in his supposedly experimental and artistic motion picture and offers him a paycheck he can't possible resist. The only condition is that Milos doesn't have any insight in the script and shoots his scenes on a day by day basis. Quite obviously Vukmir is producing a snuff movie and forces Milos, whether or not under the influence of drugs, to do extremely nasty stuff to his co-actresses in front of the camera. Undoubtedly, ""A Serbian Film"" is deeply unpleasant and grim, but the film isn't so much disturbing as it is gratuitous and provocative. You could tell the makers were proudly smirking when people stood up and walked out of the theater before the film was finished. The depiction of sex and violence are disgusting, but especially the tone and narrative are mean-spirited. And yet, all ""A Serbian Film"" is pretty well-made with imaginative camera-work and rough but professional editing. The soundtrack is terrific (that is, if you like loud and boisterous techno/dubstep tunes) and the acting is pretty decent. The film contains at least four sequences that I'll never ever forget in my life. Yikes.",A Serbian Film
5,poolandrews,Quite boring actually.,3,4 September 2010,"A Serbian Film is set in Serbia where an ageing & retired porn star named Milos (Srdjan Todorovic) lives with his wife & young son. One of his former contacts in the pron business tells Milos that a director named Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic) wants to hire him to star in an artistic porn film, once Milos realises how much he will get paid he signs the contract without even reading a script. On the first day of shooting Milos is driven to a child orphanage where a woman sucks him off while a child looks on. Uncomfortable with the presence of children during the shoot & the increasingly violent acts Vukmir ask's him to do Milos decides to quit. Milos tells Vukmir who tries to talk him out of it but can't, however Vukmir won't let Milos quit & drugs his drink. Constantly drugged up & told what to do Milos complies with the depraved acts of sex & sadism that Vukmir orders...Known as Srpski Film in it's native country this Serbian production was co-written, produced & directed by Srdjan Spasojevic & is a film that gained quite a reputation for itself although I think it's largely undeserving, A Serbian Film wants to be shocking & I suppose it is at times but overall I can't say I was that impressed with it. Now, while defending this the makers (writer & director Spasojevic in particular) have explicitly said on record that A Serbian Film is an comment on Serbian society where they claim 'everyone' feels like they are f*cked from the moment they are born to the moment they die. Well that's all fine & dandy but I don't live in Serbia, I have never been to Serbia & if I'm honest I don't know anything about Serbia or even where it is on a map so what exactly am I meant to take from A Serbian Film? I see many are calling A Serbian Film challenging, shocking, disturbing, depraved & unique which it is to some extent but I will also add the word boring to that list as that's what stood out for me the most. If we actually break A Serbian Film down it's fifty five minutes before anything extreme happens, the first forty odd minutes is a total snooze-fest that builds the character of Milos at the expense of everyone else so when the big twist arrives at the end (which I guessed correctly, by the way) I was sat there thinking why did this guy do that? Almost no explanation is given & it just seems like a twist for the sake of having a twist. Then there's the silly shock ending which implies everything that has gone before had been planned, yeah right. The story never really gripped, even though all these brutal & depraved things were supposedly happening I never felt anything, I thought the film & it's character's were hollow & empty & I found it hard to emote with anyone or with anything.Comments describing A Serbian Film as the sickest, most depraved film ever don't help either, like I say it's fifty five minutes before that stuff kicks in & even then the thought of what is going on is more disturbing than what you actually see. A newborn baby is delivered & then sexually abused (off-screen thankfully so you don't 'see' it), a man chokes a woman who has had all her teeth pulled out (no, you don't see that happen either) with his cock, Milos gets revenge on one of the bad guy's by shoving is erect cock into his eye socket (!) in a scene that is more silly than anything else, Milos has anal sex with a chained up woman & chops her head off with a machete while doing so (in a scene less graphic than a very similar one in Nekromantik 2 (1991)), a few people are beaten, there's a fair amount of blood splatter, a guy has a chunk of his throat bitten out, someone is bashed over the head & a couple of guy's are shot. I assume people are finding A Serbian Film as shocking as they seem too because of the mixing of sex & violence & as expected all of the sexualised violence is towards women. The sex scenes are often inter-cut with images of children & there are also a couple of sex scenes involving children (accomplished using cutaways & reaction shots) which is just going too far & I am sure even the supporters of A Serbian Film would have a hard time defending these sequences. As expected lots of women get naked, there are plenty of naked breast's & minges on show but all the sex scenes are strictly soft-core.Suffering almost four minutes worth of censorship cuts here in the UK A Serbian Film was pulled from the recent Frightfest because of the extensive cutting. The makers probably loved that since it's given them plenty of publicity about how nasty, depraved & disturbing A Serbian Film is. Filmed in Belgrade in Serbia during the back end of 2008 I assume it's sat on the shelf unreleased for the past couple of years & I can see why. Filmed in Serbian with English subtitles the acting seemed OK.A Serbian Film which many will find shocking although the thought of what they are seeing is probably more shocking than what is actually shown, a slow moving & odd little horror thriller that mixes sex & violence to little effect. When i watch a film I want to be entertained first & foremost, all I'm trying to say is that A Serbian Film just didn't entertain me.",A Serbian Film
6,Boba_Fett1138,"Despite of everything, I was fascinated and respected the movie for what it was doing.",8,27 December 2011,"Normally I feel bad for not liking a movie that I feel I should like but in this case I feel bad for liking a movie that I by all means shouldn't like.With its themes of pedophilia, necrophilia, rape and extreme violence, this was one of the most controversial movies of recent years. And is it all truly that bad? Well, as far as movies go, this isn't really even one of the most graphic movies I have ever seen but it more so becomes controversial purely through its themes.But you might wonder what there is to like about a movie, that is showing sex with very young children and other disturbing things, involving sex and violence, or a combination of the both. It just all depends on how you are willing to take this movie. If you go in, knowing you are going to despise every second of it because of its themes, you are obviously never going to like this movie. However when you are going in with a more open mind, you are more able to see what the movie is trying to do and how it becomes quite successful at it as well.Basically you can see this movie as an extreme porn-flick, only truly shot as a serious movie, that is constantly exploring and even crossing the lines and boundaries of its genre and what we consider to be morally acceptable. And let me tell you, I deeply respect- and appreciated the movie for this. Just imaging no one ever tried to expand the boundaries of art and entertainment. We would still be living somewhere in the 5th century if we didn't. It's not like this movie is advocating for more pedophilia or rape and violence in movies but it is raising the bar again, which challenges other movies to explore certain things even further and deeper, without necessarily becoming graphic with it as well.Just see it like this; take it as a fashion show, in which the models are showing the most crazy and extreme looking clothes. It's not like we ever get to buy those silly and extreme looking clothes in any store but the clothes and models are merely demonstrating what the new trends and possibilities are going to be. This is exactly what ""Srpski film"" is doing as well. By being as extreme as possible it is raising the bar and setting new standards for future movies to come.And seriously, everybody is focusing heavily- or falling over the pedophilia aspects but that's really only just one of the movie its themes and hardly its main focus at all, or what the movie is all about, so please don't let this scare you off. And really, the movie is also far less artistic than most people are making it sound. Well, perhaps I should say that it is a more accessible movie than you would think . It's pretty much following a 'normal' main storyline and the way the movie is shot is also not too 'complicated'. It's actually a really well shot movie, that is great and professionally looking, in every aspect and effectively told and directed by Srdjan Spasojevic.Fore even if you are incredibly shocked and disturbed by this movie, it means it is an effective one and succeeded at what it was trying to do, whether you like it or not. But you're not giving this movie enough credit when just saying that this is a movie purely made to shock. It has too much quality and true intentions in it for that.The only thing that made this movie not so perfect was its story at times. Toward its end you could say that the movie is turning more into a thriller and the story was losing me a bit, due to some of its developments.An effective movie, at what it's trying to achieve, that pretty much intrigued me all throughout.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Serbian Film
7,trashgang,the roughest I seen so far,10,25 August 2010,"A lot is already said about A Serbian Movie and a lot will be said about this gem. I mean, man, if you are going to watch this you are really in some kind of hell. I have seen thousands of movies all in the horror and exploitation genre and I have seen the roughest you could see so far. From the ""roughies"" from the seventies up to Cannibal Holocaust to Nekromantik to Irreversible to August Underground and at last the holy tree from France (Martyrs, Frontiere(s), Inside). After all these flicks I thought, you can't get it rougher but the words were out in horrorland that there was one from Serbia that will be better than all others. Afraid of the hype I got me a screener version. So that means full uncut. Because the issues in the movie it is already banned in a lot of countries so to catch a copy will be hard if you don't know your way. Also, this is my first movie I gave a 10 out of 10. I mean, the director wasn't afraid to show it all and some points in the film really aren't for the squeamish. The story line I can give in two sentences. A retired porn actor needs money to feed his family. he get's an offer for a new porn but he can't get the script of it, he just has to play along. End of story. The first 20 minutes you will probably think, is this it? The only thing you see is fragments of his films and getting to know his wife and kid. Once he's going to sign the contract to star in that unknown porn, things get from worse to worser. All the acting is excellent, the editing is great and the score is almost always the same but it works. What you will get is, shaved vajayjay, tight bums, boobs, dicks, blow jobs, child abuse, hitting, slashing, raping, beheading, drugs, necrophilia, catch 22, and some scene's that aren't really for the faint hearted, I mean, a teenager watching a man cum, the rape of a newborn, pedophilia, a scene that will remind you of Nekromantik 2 but only bloodier and rougher. If you wanted to watch depravity go find A Serbian Movie. My number one of all time!",A Serbian Film
8,deloudelouvain,Not for the weak stomaches,7,13 February 2015,"This must be one of the sickest movies I ever watched. I thought I saw the nastiest with ""The Human Centipede"" but this one is at least as hard and sick. The movie itself is actually not bad at all. In fact I really liked it, the story and the actors are all good. You get into the story really quick and you want to know how this will end even if the scenes are hardcore. It's not one of those gory movies with monsters that you know don't exist anyway. Knowing that there must be sick bastards like that on earth makes it that you are even more absorbed by the story. But let me tell you if you have problems with violent sex scenes then you shouldn't watch this movie. It for sure not a movie for people with weak stomaches.",A Serbian Film
9,HumanoidOfFlesh,The dark side of porn.,8,13 July 2010,"Let me tell you one thing:I have seen the sickest horror/exploitation movies ever made including ""Cannibal Holocaust"",""Mu Zan E"",""Forced Entry"",""The Taming of Rebecca"",""August Underground"" series,""Angst"",""In a Glass Cage"",""First Transmission"",""Despair"",""Aftermath"",""Man Behind the Sun"",""Lolita Vibrator Torture"",""Martyrs"" or ""The Untold Story"",but some ideas presented in ""A Serbian Film"" left me speechless.A story of Milos,a former porn star,who accepts the role in utterly sick porn produced and directed by shady Vukmir is certainly disturbing and shocking.The film is well-made and competently acted and the Serbian porno starlets/actresses are truly hot.There are some truly revolting scenes in ""A Serbian Film"" including rough anal sex/decapitation,infant rape and paedophilia,various beatings and bloody violence.The action is fast,the cinematography is beautiful and the script is filled with despair and resignation.Serbia is shown as a truly rotten and hellish place to live just like in the other controversial Serbian film ""The Life and Death of a Porn Gang"".Be prepared.Be very prepared.""A Serbian Film"" will make you wanna get up and vomit!8 out of 10.",A Serbian Film
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,Gruesome,7,28 October 2011,"On the internet one of the films that has had the biggest buzz that I noticed was a movie called A Serbian Film, getting so many bans and claiming to be too extreme to show to any audience. Naturally being the freak that I am love to see the forbidden, I've seen a lot of extreme films trying to test my limits on what I can take. For some reason I did build this movie up in my head to make it a lot worse than I could imagine, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. However, this did push my limits and not even with the particular ""newborn"" scene that is usually the center of attention, keeping in mind that I watched films like The Exorcist and Jaws when I was a child so I know what's a movie and what's reality, it's the ending that killed me. The reason I love extreme films is because I feel that a lot of films are so watered down with the truth and that bad things do happen to good people. It's a hard reality to accept and you don't want to believe it, we close our eyes to a lot of crimes every day. I thought that A Serbian Film was going to be like that, I know the porn industry has been labeled as too extreme for a lot of people to quit or end up dying of disease or drug over dose, but this took it to a much darker level of almost being a snuff film done in a Hollywood way.Milo is a semi-retired Serbian porn star with a beautiful wife, Marija, and young son, Petar. Although he is strapped financially and his home life is happy, his biggest problem comes in the form of the jealousies of his brother, Marko, a corrupt police officer who envies Milo' family life. Seeking one last big payday to make a clean break from pornography and secure his family's financial future, Milo is intrigued when one of his former co-stars, Lejla, approaches him with an offer to star in an ""art film"" being directed by Vukmir, a well-connected, independently wealthy pornographer who wants to cast Milo for his legendary ability to get and maintain an erection. When Vukmir offers Milo a large sum of money to star in the film, Milo reluctantly agrees, ambivalent towards Vukmir's insistence that he must remain ignorant as to the plot of the film until shooting begins. Milo is picked up the next morning and taken to an orphanage where he is supplied an earpiece by Vukmir's driver. He goes into the making of this film realizing that he may of just made the biggest mistake of his life with the director's darker intentions.It's hard to say if I liked this film or not, excluding the scenes that are extreme, there are some strange moments. Petar, the son, is watching one of his dad's old porn films and his parents walk in and treat it pretty light hearted and when he starts asking them what that funny feeling in his pants was his dad tells him to fix it with his hand. Keeping in mind this is a child who could be no more than 10 years old. The last minute of this film was a little confusing. But all in all, this is a tragic film and I would agree that this film can be way too hard to handle. The ending is absolutely horrific and without giving too much away, just trust me when I say that if you think you've seen it all, you'll still be shocked and sickened. I don't know what the director's purpose with this movie was, I did read that it was his take on the Serbian government, which confuses me even more. I don't know if it was a way of saying they screw around with the people too much? I give the film a lot of credit as it has the kahoniees to go where no mainstream film dares to go. I can see the reason for the ban from several countries. Like I said, if you think you've seen it all, A Serbian Film will still make your mouth drop at least once. To those who think it wasn't shocking, I don't want to know what you do consider to be in bad taste. So if you're curious, just be prepared, I don't even know if I could tell my friends about this film because they will definitely be asking me how I made it through this movie.7/10",A Serbian Film
11,KineticSeoul,"Has just about everything messed up you can think of in a film of this type, and some more",6,21 September 2010,"This has to be one of the most messed up films I have ever seen. Especially cause of one of the most messed up scene in it. I first read about this film and how much of a shocking monstrosity it is, and it turns out the shock factor is top notch, it really is that messed up. The film starts out really slow about aging ex big shot porn star who gets offered a lot of money to do a film for this weird rich guy who wants to direct a porn film and claims he is going to make a work of art with him. Well let's just say the porn star guy is in for WAY much more than he bargained for. You can actually see it coming when the porn director doesn't tell the porn star what he is in for, but gives him a contract to sign anyways. The porn star has a wife and a kid and wants money in order to leave the financial problems behind, takes the offer. The first half of the film goes really slow, it's trying to build the plot and tension, but I personally thought it was a bit too slow and pointless at times cause it seemed to drag. For the first half of the film you know what is going on and yet you sort of don't get whats going on cause of the random and bizarre stuff they start shooting on camera. It's porn and yet even the porn star guy is confused at how weird everything is, although he was in some weird stuff, it's nothing as creepy and weird as the stuff he is told to do. But when the hardcore exploitation style filming begins, it goes freaking bonkers. Now I seen a lot of messed up films with hardcore violence and exploitation, but this one is around the top in that department. For some casual movie watchers, this film is really going to be hard to watch, some may just leave cause of the vulgar shock value of it all. For those that like these types of exploitation films, with it's super gruesome and messed up scenes are probably going to enjoy the shock value of it all. There is also psychological aspects of it, about human nature for some when it comes to pornography and violence. What can I say this is one of those European films with everything that most people know of being totally messed up, is in this film. Some stuff I never even imagined. Now this film really isn't for everyone, but I know this film's target audiences and they will like it. They will think how messed up it is and than think how it was worth watching cause some people are really into this stuff, which is kinda the point of the film itself. It probably ain't one of the goriest and bloodiest movies for these type of films go, but the shock factor is still pretty darn high. The most messed up scene in this was a real shocker and I actually had to turn away for a few seconds. Again some may enjoy it, others probably won't be able to stomach this stuff and some that can probably won't like it cause of it's content and context.6.6/10",A Serbian Film
12,thesar-2,8mm2,5,8 October 2012,"One of the funniest – perhaps scariest? – things I heard about A Serbian Film prior to me watching it was a movie critic friend of mine advising me to see the uncut version and not the American one. For, they had to edit the film down to receive an NC-17 rating in the States, he said. Edit it down to an NC-17??Well, chances are you've never heard of the American (or Serbian?) version of this film and I'll bet even more money you wouldn't watch this either way. It's an enormously graphic snuff film disguised as art mimicking, well, snuff.ButI will hand it to the filmmaker Srdjan Spasojevic, he did set up the film nicely in the first half making you wonder if all the negative things you heard about this (if any) were fabricated. Well, just wait. Literally the second half is pure hell.Sadly, however, as much as people spoke about this as thee most graphic, enormously disturbing and incredibly sick film ever conceived, they actually made it less so for me. In fact, I stand by my previous words: The Human Centipede II is, to me: thee most graphic, enormously disturbing and incredibly sick film ever conceived. This comes in second.Not to damper this film; believe me: this is very vile and twisted and it seemed to have every conceivable sexually deprived act (with some made up, I'd reckon) known to man with the exception of probably just autoerotic asphyxiation. Whew! You missed one!Our ""hero,"" Milos, is an ex-porn star – and, according the movie, the biggest porn star and yet, he must be the ugliest foreign actor next to Gérard Depardieu – who's summoned out of retirement to shoot one more porn, er ""art"" film for an obscene amount of money that's never disclosed. He's suspicious, but his partner convinces him to accept to support their family.At first, like the real movie you're viewing, things aren't that bad. But, to avoid spoilers, I will make this as absolutely simple as I can without ruining anything: think a rated-XXX journey down the rabbit hole. And then multiply that image by ten.I guess I am as guilty as those before me that labeled this as the worst of the worst in regards to gore and unforgivable scenes. I believe I am simply warning you that, while there is a statement here, while the graphics are realistic and the acting and cinematography is decentthe movie should be a skip.Unless your real-life pleasures are on the same playing field as those attracted to opening the puzzle box in the Hellraiser series, there's really no reason to journey into this extreme darkness.",A Serbian Film

14,callanvass,"One of the most offensive films I've ever seen, but strangely engrossing as well",8,15 October 2013,"This is a really hard film to rate. It's not pleasant to witness, and I got the feeling that Srdjan Spasojevic did whatever he could to disgust his audience, and it worked most of the time. What I liked about this movie is that it's not just about shocking violence; it does have a solid story. Milos (Sympathetically played by SrdjanTodorovic) is a convincing family man, and one that truly loves his wife and son. He's no longer interested in the porn business, and wants to settle down. The problem is that he doesn't have enough money stashed away, and he gets an offer he can't refuse. We all do things we aren't proud of, for the ones we love. This really gripped me thoroughly, and not only was it practical, but believable as well. It has a psychological feel to it, and I was reeled in from the outset. In the second half The director takes us into the realm of the bizarre. I'm talking outlandish things beyond your imagination. I'm not gonna spoil it, but some of the stuff you'll see will shock you. At least it did me. Milos becomes an uncontrollable monster, who wants to have sex, any chance he can get. It does get a little unbelievable, but it still managed to get to me. Marko (Slobodan Bestic) plays his sleazy role very effectively, whilst Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic) plays a man so despicable, that it's almost OTT. The first half flows better than the second half. It got a little too repulsive for me at times, and the ending is unfathomable. That being said, it was still an effective second half, just not quite as good as the extremely strong first half. Final Thoughts: This is a hard film to review. It's a movie that will stick with you. You'll either get into it, or be turned off by it. One thing is for sure, it's a very powerful movie8.7/10",A Serbian Film
15,Bored_Dragon,"Good movie, terrible name",7,10 October 2016,"At first, I was rejected and disgusted, but then I decided to give it another chance without prejudice.Technically speaking, the movie is very well done, far better than almost every other Serbian movie I ever saw, and as I am Serb I saw quite a few. Story... OK, it's morbid, sick, disturbed, even insane, but the warning is clearly stated: drama/horror/mystery, so those who do not like horrors are warned and should skip it. Nobody forces them to watch. However disturbing it may be, in its own genre it is not so shocking, no more than ""Hostel"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" for example. It has an easy introduction, a good plot, few nice twists, and an ending typical for its genre. The quality screenplay, pretty good acting and, for Serbia, fantastic production. Within the genre, it's surely the very best Serbian movie.The main issue with this movie, the thing that makes it controversial and repulsive for a domestic audience and even lovers of the genre, is its name. ""Hostel"" was not named ""Czech Movie"", it was named ""Hostel"". This country, if we had a real one thou, should have censored this title and force authors to change its name before releasing the movie. They had no right to represent our country this way. There's enough prejudice against Serbia and other Balkan countries already, we do not need more negative representations. After all, it is just a movie and it should be observed like fiction that it is, but under a different name, more fitting to the horror genre, it would be much better accepted.For the movie: 7/10

17,Rodrigo_Amaro,Watch it at your own risk.,9,13 September 2011,"I was going to write about this film back in July right after I watched it after hearing about the controversial banning in Rio de Janeiro where a court order prohibited the film of being shown, following what a prosecutor heard about the film's nasty content (this person never saw it) when of its release in a festival. I'm glad I didn't wrote the following text that time, now that I know this movie cannot be shown on theaters here. And people fought for it, including its brave distributor, to no avail so far. Release was delayed after the Rio issue to end of August (by this time I already watched an excellent copy on the internet) but Public Ministry said no, this movie cannot be shown. I'm gonna bother you with some historical insight rather than explicit the film to make a valid point of why you should see the film and why I have such a high regard for it.Censorship seems to be coming back! After 21 years of a Military Dictatorship that destroyed lives and banned or prohibited music, films, books and things related with ours and foreign culture that was considered subversive to the country's regime, we, the Brazilian people have to fight against censorship all over again with the infamous ""A Serbian Film"", recently released and banned in (as of this date, in the whole country). Those who fought endlessly to never permit that such atrocity would happen are seeing that these things never ceased actually. Here's some examples: Godard's ""Je Vous Salue Marie"" was vetoed without being watched by anyone back in 1986, now you can easily find the DVD; ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" almost went through the same way; the documentary ""Beyond Citizen Kane"" had its premiere canceled because the powerful TV network motive of such film felt shocked with the bad publicity, therefore it can't never be shown in theaters, TV or elsewhere except internet (in which is a huge hit). Recent and notorious examples of censorship are the Rio episode of the ""The Simpsons"" (the one with the monkeys and the family being robbed, not even cable network can shown it but internet saved us again); an attempt of censorship with the controversial (for us, Brazilians) ""Tourists"" (it was a success thankfully to the media debate over it) and most recently the educational, cute and sensible short film named ""Eu Não Quero Voltar Sozinho"" (""I Don't Want to Go Home Alone""), banned in one state. And it's not just in Brazil, but in several other parts of the world ""A Serbian Film"" suffered this thing or had some of its content reduced, butchered.I've heard lots of things about this film here and there, about how shocking it was but it was only after knowing about its banning in Rio, that I really watched it right away, wanting to see if it is all that awful or scary. It is disturbing, it is quite scary, awful you imagine this story happening in real life but it's certainly cinematically impressive, it breaks rules and it's difficult to not leave the experience without feeling depressed or disgusted. All in all, censorship is never justified. Worst: those who vetoed never watched it, only hearing what the movie was exposing. ""A Serbian Film"" tells the story of a decadent male porn star in need of money who accepts to work on a unusual project for people he doesn't know and barely can't trust. And when he tries to walk out of it he realizes he can't do that, and worst, his life and the lives of his wife and child might be at a very high risk. Why I (can I say this?) enjoyed it? The presentation, from its well elaborated opening to the disturbing ending, the movie succeed it in being scary, thrilling, quite original with very few clichés or obvious parts. It deals with unthinkable things, most of it perhaps we wish that could never happen in real life, but it does, and that's the problem for most audiences to relate with the movie. Director Srdjan Spasojevic says he was trying to show through this story of how low his country was during the Bosnia conflicts in the 1990's. But, can we really feel this while watching it? Sorry, but no. Audiences will look at this film as something irrelevant (quite so if you don't think in cinematic terms) and a huge exploration on perversities, where everything is allowed even the rape of a child and a new born baby, and human values going to the drain, people at its lowest. About these mentioned repulsive scenes, the director deserves some credit for never, at any point, making things explicit; just the idea of seeing such brutality is scary enough to make you put your guts out no matter how many creepy films you've watched in your entire life. I totally understand viewers who'll say never want to watch this film, or walk out after the sickening parts, I really do. What I cannot comprehend is why people who doesn't deal with films or art are trying to impeach the people who want to watch the film, and even worst, declaring that according to the law it is criminal, or that it glorifies pedophilia. We're there to watch the film, see the despicable nature of human being and feel revolted with that and THINK that for one moment this is the kind of thing that only happen in films, and we must never allow it to take place in real life. As far as I'm concerned, putting these heated debate on the side, this is really a great horror film that knows how to shock more than slasher killers and ghosts out there. Not the kind of film I would recommend to a large crowd but only for those who can deal with everything. 9/10",A Serbian Film
18,tomgillespie2002,I don't buy it,3,14 December 2013,"If you like your horror movies extreme, then chances are you would have heard of, or seen, Srdjan Spasojevic's A Serbian Film. Pushing boundaries of taboo to their very extremities, the movie features rape, paedophilia, necrophilia, and all manners of degrading acts, mainly towards women. It also features a scene where a women gives birth to a baby, only to hand it to a man who then rapes it. They call it 'newborn porn'. The most terrible thing abut A Serbian Film is that the way it tries to disguise its cheap exploitation tactics as some kind of social allegory of life in Serbia.Retired porn star Milos (Srdjan Todorovic) is a man that knows little apart from how to please a girl, and audiences, on screen. Bored with his life, but happy with his wife and child, he is drawn into a mysterious new film by a whopping pay cheque. The movie's eccentric director, Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic), keeps the production close to the chest, promising it to be a piece of high art and something that its audience is crying out for. Filming begins at an abandoned children's orphanage, and things take a downward turn from there as it becomes apparent that Milos has been drawn into a snuff movie.I can appreciate the film's themes, certainly. With the availability of the internet and its most popular asset, porn (as well as other mediums of humiliation such as Youtube), society has become obsessed with masochism and degradation. A Serbian Film attempts to challenge our desires by showing the most repulsive things that its director can come up with. So, we get to see a man raping his own six year-old son and the blood spattering from his anus and down his legs. How exactly is this repulsive imagery supposed to make us reflect? Perhaps if the cheap tactics weren't so laughably obvious and exploitative, this may have been a powerful message.Even more disturbingly, A Serbian Film looks very nice. The cinematography, lighting, and even the acting is akin to your standard A-grade movie, so the film occasionally achieves a hint of atmosphere. But ultimately, this is from the Hostel School of Torture Porn, and revels too much in its own misery and blood-shed to take seriously. This is simply unpleasant viewing, which is fine, as long as it's relevant. I simply don't see how knocking a woman's teeth out and then choking her to death on an erect penis serves as a metaphor for Serbian society. I just don't buy it.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",A Serbian Film

20,videorama-759-859391,"A Serbian film, not a good film",4,28 July 2015,"You gotta love originality in films, but in push the envelope films films like this. I'm referring to the first scene, with a porn actor catching his little son, watching one of his own blueys. ASF is experimental, pornographic, and in parts, shocking, another film testing the viewer's eye, and limits, with some graphically violent scenes, one involving a baby would you believe. Just watch. Though originally banned, from what I heard off a colleague, I was surprised to see it on the DVD shelf. I had to see it for myself, and it does rate quite high on the shockometer. The film, acted and directed by it's lead star, is basically about a has been porn actor, Milos, now reduced to doing crap, and that's no bull, as we're warranted some footage. He is approached by an old girlfriend/porn actress, who tells him of this new filmmaker, Vukmur, who's making something really dark, where Milos virtually just has to play himself, with the camera of course him, where he's witnessed to some shocking and truly unsettling moments, the dark director's young daughter, partaking in them, along with other actors. Milos starts to question the director's authenticity, really having reservations, threatening to quit. He even has his older brother, a cop, to do a background check, where this director is a mystery. Milos starts being drugged, kidnapped, and forced to perform things against his nature, where he himself is slowly losing it. The story, I must admit I liked though I found hard to accept how Milos, could let himself change like he does, where I couldn't really buy, that drugs alone could do this, especially considered when judging the shocking ending. Or may'be Milos, really lost it somewhere, and went nutso. And that's what A Serbian Film is, a psychological drama that goes to the real dark recesses, of one's self, but again, as in other controversial pics like this, it's a cheap and weak facade, that belies a number of nasty things, like snuff, child murder and abuse and some brutal pornographic images, purely to shock, just like this dark director Vukmur, wants to do, for his small, private, and sick clientele. The director of this Indie shock pic, gives a fine performance, having me thinking he was a legit porn actor when not doing this, as it was such a naturalistic performance (one scene involving a threesome, almost blindly convinced me of that) The others weren't bad either, esp. Vukmur. Yes the lead actor/director does have a talent, creating something successfully and mind blowingly shocking. I love the film for it's darkness, but the film is so dirty and brilliantly corrupt, with some of the most disturbing themes in film, which doesn't constitute for a good film, and one that is certainly not for the faint hearted. Electric music score, ultimately fitting.",A Serbian Film
21,jadavix,Series of failed attempts to shock,3,5 July 2020,"So I finally got around to seeing this, and I have to say, it's overrated.I don't mean ""overrated"" in the sense of being considered better than it is. I don't know if anyone out there says it's a great movie. It's just that it tops every list of disturbing, not-for-the-faint-of-heart movies out there, and I didn't find it shocking or disturbing, other than one, infamous scene, which is not really graphic.Mostly the movie is just boring. It's about a guy who is tricked by an enigmatic millionaire to resurrect his porn career one last time. The kind of scenes he has to shoot get increasingly disturbing, featuring murder (leading to necrophilia) and even paedophilia. It feels like the filmmaker just trotting out the most boundary pushing material he can to try to push your buttons. You know, like the kid in school who got your attention with dirty jokes, but after a while your shock turned to irritation and ennui.Allegedly the film has some subtext relating to the history of the country that it its namesake, ie. the Serbian people are the porn star, Milosevic is the millionaire, and all the messed up stuff the guy had to do in front of the camera are the war crimes he committed in the name of the Serbian people.I'm not sure I buy that. ""Man Bites Dog"" was a genuinely disturbing, shocking movie that had some good points to make about the culpability of voyeurs in crime. It was also more than just a series of increasingly unspeakable acts.
What does this movie say, exactly? You don't even have to watch it to get the point. It's a parable in a premise, and the premise goes nowhere worthwhile.",A Serbian Film

23,TdSmth5,Nothing short of brilliant,10,25 March 2012,"I had to watch this twice before being able to come up with a review. It sure is like no other film.Milos, a famed retired porn star, is told by an ex-colleague that a producer of avant-garde cutting edge porn is looking to hire him and pay him big bucks. Milos has a beautiful wife and a son but they are poor. He relies on his brother who is a corrupt cop. He agrees to meet this auteur named Vukmir, who doesn't go into details of the movie but is quick to produce a contract. After talking to his wife, Milos agrees, even though he still has some reservations about not knowing what he's going to be asked to do.The shooting takes several days. A group of security guards act as cameramen following Milos' every move. He's taken to an orphanage and witnesses a mother beating her daughter, then production people beat the mother. All this while Milos watches in disbelief. Little by little he is conditioned to mix pleasure with aberrant, violent, transgressive, scenes, people, and events. He decides to quit. He won't do anything that involves children and violence. Vukmir comes clean and tells him what he is up to and what he wants to do. He shows him, in the most difficult scene of the movie. Milos gets the hell out of there, but he was drugged.He wakes up three days latter, bloodied and urinating blood. He has horrible flashbacks. He traces back his steps and what happened to him has to be the worst thing that can happen to a human being, in real life and in cinema. He relives everything and finds the tapes that were filmed that fill in the gaps. Since he was drugged he participated in activities that he would never had otherwise. The climax of the Vukmir's work is a true masterpiece of depravation. Milos regains his senses a bit and can do nothing but take brutal vengeance. Not even his family was spared by Vukmir. The two events that take place at the end of the movie are brilliant.A Serbian Film puts on film every extreme act of horror/gore/porn one can imagine, when one is a teen fan of horror and discussing with friends what would be most brutal stuff one could film and one friend upstages the other with gruesome ideas. Nothing here is sacred, not family, not life itself. However, this movie is beautifully filmed and it has a warm and gentle tone. This is not a movie that rejoices in the grotesque. The film makers do their best not to show the brutal stuff that goes on. Many of those things take up a split second frame. This isn't one of those US necro-porn primetime series where the camera lingers on wasted bloodied corpses.As to the question if this is art of just an excuse to show us disgusting stuff, the answer is clear, this is cinema of the highest order. This isn't extreme Japanese or German horror, where the stomach of the viewer matters little nor American malevolent thriller horror that glorifies evil. A Serbian Film respects the audience's sensibilities. What it doesn't respect is Serbia. It has such a negative, pessimistic and hopeless outlook, it's quite stunning. Milos and his wife can't believe the opportunity he's offered because they and others in this movie are convinced that nothing good can ever happen in Serbia. And given what happens, they were right. Not even friends and family can be trusted. The notion of a Serbian family comes up near the end and it's the kind of stuff Hollywood would love to make a sitcom out of, if they could. Fortunately, they can't, yet. Hollywood relishes to make movies that make America look bad, but it's nothing like this. The difference is that this is done by people who love Serbia and that makes it all the more heartbraking as opposed to America-hating Hollywood producers/directors/actors ridiculing regular working-class religious Americans.One can't escape the sense that there is a parallel between Vukmir and the makers of A Serbian Film. His speeches are quite genial, they give a religious, political, philosophical sense to what he is doing. And yet he does his work at the order of wealthy clients. What he says in a way conveys what the filmmakers themselves have said in interviews. He (and they) is trying to provide a cathartic ad astra per asperga type of waking up for the country. And despite all the horror, playing the victim card isn't the answer either, hence his showing of what a real victim is.A Serbian Film is brilliant. The acting is superb. After the initial 30 minutes intro and setup, the next hour and 20 minutes is quite relentless. But the situations Milos is put in are so unreal and impossible and his reactions and expression are accordingly stunned, it's actually quite humorous to see him. It's also perfectly filmed, without gimmicks that Hollywood can't do without, like jarring editing, dance club lighting or alternatively, ridiculous discolored coloring. What shines though is the story and how it is told. Truly a lesson to American scriptwriters, not so much in content please, but in how to develop a story and involve the viewer, not with CGI but with heart.The title of the film is very telling. After what was done to Serbia and the region one can only conclude that the West deserves this film. If you think this is bad, just wait and see what films Iraq and Afghanistan may produce some day. Now that's not something I look forward to.",A Serbian Film
24,fertilecelluloid,Shock Treatment,7,26 July 2010,"Several months ago, Srdjan Spasojevic's Serbian Movie started to circulate at festivals. Harry Knowles wrote a histrionic review that placed it on the must-see lists of hardcore horror fanatics. Other scribes discussed its extreme nature and went nuts hyping its taboo-breaking content. Some even questioned its reason for existing.The usual clichéd response to films with inflammatory intent is Why do we need to see this? It's a stupid question because the answer is we don't. Then again, we don't NEED to see Disney movies, either, or TV shows about crab fishermen risking their lives. We NEED to eat, sleep, drink, and breathe. Everything else is secondary.Hysterics aside, Serbian Movie was clearly made to shock and provoke because it doesn't offer too much else. 99.9% of humans will find it objectionable and offensive and will stay away. The rest, like me, will let their curiosity get the better of them.The film is very technically polished. The compositions and lighting are on par with any American horror film in the Hostel budget range. The acting is decent, too. The film's lead (Sergej Trifunovic), who plays an ex-porno actor lured back into the business, bears a strange resemblance to Euro porn actor/director Christophe Clarke, and has a laconic, laid back manner that works well for his character. The film's villain (Srdjan Todorovic), a philosophy-spewing porno ""artist"", looks like a younger, better manicured Coffin Joe. The lead's wife, who is accepting of her husband's profession, is played with quiet authority by Katarina Zutic. Finally, the couple's son, who plays quite a special role in the film, is particularly impressive as an unfortunate young victim of demented minds.Some of our favorite horror films are notable for extreme set pieces. Emmanuelle in America has a ripper, as do Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, and In A Glass Cage. Serbian Movie definitely deserves to be placed alongside these for its extremity and perversion. One set piece in particular, involving a newborn, is the film's most harrowing. Clearly, no real infant was harmed, but the single angle and sound effects create a very disturbing ninety seconds you won't soon forget. Other horrors include an eye socket being penetrated with an erect penis and two unidentified bodies being carnally assaulted.Horror in its purest sense allows us to confront the unspeakable in the safe environment of the cinema or home. Serbian Movie definitely dishes up the unspeakable and does so with style and solid craftsmanship. Although you will find material such as this in the literary works of authors such as Edward Lee, Marquis De Sade, and JF Gonzalez, cinematic representations are, not surprisingly, not as common.Unfortunately, the Serbian Movie script is a little undercooked, and its depiction of organized perversion amongst the elite is not entirely believable. The villain, who not only looks like Coffin Joe, spouts philosophy like him, too. In this case, it's porno philosophy. This nut bag sees 'newborn porn' as the future of the genre, and carries on up the Khyer about love, art, and blood ad nausea. Perhaps expressing the filmmaker's view, he says of Serbia: ""...this is no country for real art."" On porn, he offers: ""(it exists) so those who can't get laid can come."" Without a doubt, his most salient observation is: ""'Victim sells."" No horror fan can dispute that.What separates Serbian Movie, however, from a true masterwork such as Augustin Villaronga's In A Glass Cage are several things, the primary one being substance. Although its montages of public porno culture suggest that sexualized commercialization is out of control, this thesis is not explored beyond a headline, and it's a stretch to link sexually provocative billboards to horrors such as baby rape and the raping of beheaded women. The gulf between the two is vast.Ultimately for the viewer, the film is an exercise in waiting for the next shocking set piece that will up the perversion ante. The bits between these are not of zero interest, but they're not exactly vital, either, and there's some narrative confusion in the final quarter as the lead character lurches about in a drug-induced haze.Even after the final shocking revelation, a closing slice of dialog takes the perversion even further, bluntly re-stating the film's ultimate intentions.As my brain cooled hours later after the experience, I felt like I'd eaten very greasy, slightly poisonous junk food. This contrasted with my initial reaction to John McNaughton's Henry - Portrait of a Serial Killer, another flick notable for its shocking content, but appreciated for its solid scripting, amazing performances, and characterization. Henry left me with the feeling that I'd seen something very special. Serbian Movie didn't feel special, but it sure felt like raw and courageous cinema.Director Srdjan Spasojevic's Life and Death of a Porno Gang, his first feature, is well worth checking out, too, and I will discuss it shortly.",A Serbian Film

27,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,A Serbian Film (2010),6,14 December 2011,"A film that is so controversial, I found it hard to find the IMDb page for it. It's been responsible for police raids in the UK. The director clearly wants to show how (figuratively) Serbians are screwed from the moment they are born until after they die. Did he have to show such scenes in a literal sense? Probably not. You'll find plenty talking about the controversial aspects of this film, and plenty of arguments about the social commentary it represents. I'd like to ignore most of that and just say that the film was too uneven to have an incredible impact on me. Sure, some scenes were grotesque in the ideas they suggested, but the film let itself down. Sometimes the effects were spot on, representing a grisly and sickening feeling. Sometimes they were laughable (any shot of the plastic textured penis). Sometimes the violence seemed genuine, and others has men being stabbed in the eye with a penis. All this lead to me being confused as to what the film was trying to do. What the film does offer is sick and nasty thrills, with a few scenes just going too far. Unlike the Human Centipede, which had a gross idea but left a lot to the imagination, this film shows it all, which isn't always to its credit. I am interested in seeing the cut version, where the infamous newborn porn scene is edited so you don't see the actual act. Something tells me that is more disturbing, as the puppet used, reduced the nausea by seeming too animatronic. If nothing else this film really does question ""How far is too far?"" and ""Is censorship right?"" Not for the weak of stomach, and certainly not a date movie.",A Serbian Film

I'm not going to make an argument about how boning a guy in his empty eye-socket is essential to the plot. If that's essential to the plot, for the love of God come up with a different one. It's just that the movie is pretty well-directed, very well-acted, and almost passes by like a bizarre dream. Particularly the final act is unbearable to watch, but the least you can say is that this movie does generate some kind of emotion. It's never boring, even though you often wish it would be. Even the fact that the main baddie (calling him that is kind of an understatement) has an uncanny resemblance to George Michael only cushions the blow slightly. ""A Serbian Film"" does have an artistic value of some sort, you just have to wonder whether or not you want to sit through a guy making love to a decapitated corpse because the scene has great cinematography. I guess that's a matter of taste.",A Serbian Film
29,Matt_Layden,So we sacrifice story for shock?,2,23 August 2010,"Well, I just watched it and have come to the conclusion that there is no art here whatsoever. Just a filmmaker trying to make a name for himself by shocking people with violence, death and sexuality. He can say whatever he wants re: his reasons behind the film, but as I mentioned before it lacks any sense of human decency. If you want to see this film because so many people are hyping it up based on the controversy, I'd recommend not to. I'm one to always watch a film if it's ticked enough people off. Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox were two of them, I Spit On Your Grave was another. Yet those films are bound by the genre they represent themselves in. Exploitation and Revenge horror. A Serbian Film doesn't fall under these categories. I would suspect that Nicolas Cage would find this film on his quest in 8mm. Rape, Murder By Penis, Incest, Child Molestation, Necrophilia, etc...these things do not make for a good film, or someone wanting to tell a good story. It's simply someone who wants to take you into a world where these things happen and then excessively push you deeper into a hyper realized madness. The newborn baby scene wasn't as bad as I expected. Had I gone in not knowing it was going to happen, I might have cringed more. Plot points were predictable, specifically everything that happens in the climax. The actors were mediocre at best. The direction showed some potential, but the subject matter cheapens it, specifically when he also wrote it.We all know Serbia is a messed up place, but we don't need to sit through an agonizing film that drags on and on about the so called atrocities. Even if that was the intention of the filmmaker, which I honestly think it wasn't. He is quoted as saying ""This is a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government...It's about the monolithic power of leaders who hypnotize you to do things you don't want to do. You have to feel the violence to know what it's about."" Cue my eyes rolling. As the film ended I was left sitting there thinking to myself, sure some scenes were disturbing, but at the same time they felt empty. The obvious going for shock value loses some of it's appeal as the filmmakers try too hard to push buttons. I'm not saying they don't, they undoubtedly do. This is a film I don't recommend to anyone, not even those looking for something shocking. Not because it's too much to handle, but because it's simply a bad film.I'll give credit to those who humiliated themselves taking part in this, being an actor is hard. Do the filmmakers have balls for creating this film? Yes and no. For me, I'm fine sticking with Cannibal Holocaust and yes I still want to see Salo. If you want to watch a film that is hard to stomach, go see Martyrs.",A Serbian Film
30,begob,"Some laughs, needed more thought",5,9 November 2014,"I actually got a few laughs from this. The final scene - ""Do the kid first"" - meant the whole thing wasn't to be taken seriously. And there's a bit where the brother disappoints his hooker while watching home videos of his nephew's birthday party: ""Blow harder"". There were a few other jokes, like the billboards in English. And I probably missed others.But there were a few scenes with unintentional humour. I'm thinking of the porn actor hurling himself through a window, like a character in the Simpsons.Pity there wasn't more thought given to the idea of a film within a film, or the nature of memory or free will. It certainly had the material to reflect on those things.It's not a real horror, and at no stage did I get a jump or a sense of dread. I would have preferred some satire, like American Psycho, but that film was a let down too.Finally, the actress who played the mother is a cracking babe.",A Serbian Film
31,baumer,A repulsive film that goes way too far,5,11 March 2012,"This review will contain spoilers: There are films that really test your mettle. Those films make your skin crawl, your blood boil, your mind work overtime and your emotions are tested throughout. Off the top of my head, I can think of films like Martyrs (any Grand Pierre film really), Last House on the Left (1972), Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behind the Sun and Salo. These films are tough to watch because they dehumanize people and in Cannibal Holocaust's case, animals, which is disgusting in itself. But once you start sodomizing babies and then your own family, you have now gone way too far. There is nothing artistic about this, it's just wrong. You can almost hear the script writers sitting down for lunch one day discussing all the disgusting films they have seen over the years. They then decide that to one up those films, they need to rape a kid or do it with your own child. This would be one way to get a reaction from the audience. But there are some things that should never be shown, ever. This film crossed that line not once, not twice but four or five times.So why do I give this film a 5/10 and not the 1/10 it sounds like I should rate it? Because, as many have said before me, the film is very well made and the script is very sharp and crisp and it takes into a world that not many of us know about. I enjoyed the film for the first 70 minutes but the last 30 are just so repulsive that it really destroys all good will one might have for the film.I'm not sure what message this film was trying to convey. I'm not sure how anyone but the most perverse and perverted could enjoy a film about sexually exploiting not just kids, but newborns, but this film asks you to do that. And for that, it disgusts me.If you think you've seen it all, think again. 5/10",A Serbian Film
32,ElijahCSkuggs,A (hyped up) Serbian Film,5,13 July 2010,"A Serbian Film. What a bold title for a film, huh? These Serbian film-makers sure are proud of their Serbian heritage. This film must be a statement of sorts. Maybe a film that shows a part of Serbia that the other parts of the world aren't aware of? Maybe it's a film that sheds a bright light on some rich history of Serbian past, or maybe some legendary figure, or even a battle. Maybe it's a story that will touch people's hearts and give Serbia and their film-makers the rightful respect they earn. An epic Serbian romance? Nah. It's none of that. A Serbian Film is a modern exploitation flick that focuses on sex and shock to win over your hearts. Is it successful? Yes and no. Shocking yes, but only barely. Successful as a solid film, with an interesting story; a story that delivers more than just the sex, and the shock value? Not in the slightest bit. It's really just another entry into the long line of movies that come out every year or so that's relies on its shock factor to bring home the bacon. The special thing about this film, was that the trailer prior to coming out, showed this as some really high-production value type exploitation film with super hot babes. Who wouldn't get excited to see that? Anyways, they made good with that promise. It's all of that. It looks and sounds really nice, and the babes are all hotbut again, that don't make the sh!t shat, and it didn't fool me into thinking it's anything more than that. Hey, that rhymes! Serbian Film revolves around Milos, who is basically the equivalent of a Serbian John Holmes. Milos is retired, has a beautiful slutty wife, a little boy, he's bored with his new less-action packed life, and it appears he didn't save up enough cash for retirement. So along comes jiggly pornstar friend from the past that offers him a deal to join some artsy new porn director's film. And basically, and obviously, the film starts from there. He ends up joining with the director and then the sh!t hits the fan. And continues to do so for the next hour or so. You'll then see three or four scenes of extreme violence and perversion, and a whole slew of fast editing and dub-step music.I went into A Serbian Film with open eyes, expecting an experience that was unique and different. But it wasn't. The most recent film that was actually shocking, and well-made, besides Antichrist, was possibly Marian Dora's Cannibal. That film was under the radar, had some hype, delivered shock, and a intriguing story. This film brought barely anything but excess shots of alcohol being poured into glasses, Serbian men seriously struggling with masturbation or sex, a couple choice scenes of shock entertainment, and that isbasically it. It was glossy, it was loud, it was extreme, but it didn't combine those three aspects to create something worth talking about. A film like Nekromantik will stay in movie-goer discussions for years and years to come, but this filmno way.I didn't hate this movie. I'm hard on it.but only because of the overly strong response it's going to get because of the hype. I respect it, and the makers of the film for being willing enough to push creative boundaries. But the makers here simply didn't make a film that had enough going for it. It feltaverage, with a heavy dose of 'Look at me!'. The acting was all fine, but the writing on the other-hand, was not. The evil director had me dozing when he would spew his philosophical gobbledygook; which he did, I think, every time he was on the screen. And don't get me started on the excessive shots of alcohol being poured into glasses. What was that all about? Did I already mention the alcohol bit? Alright, enough of this.It's worth seeing to say you saw it. It's worth seeing if you're a fan of horror and exploitation. But if you're looking to see a movie that will stay with you, for other reasons besides the shock value, then pass on this one, and check out another Serbian Film, as they really are a great country for cinema.",A Serbian Film
33,Andy-296,A sick film,1,26 March 2011,"I'm not easily offended, and in fact I like edgy movies, but this film is totally sick. What is sad about it is that the director is not untalented, and for the first hour this seems to be a very good if disturbing movie. Unfortunately, the last half hour goes downhill in the most sickening way. In Serbia, Milos, a former porn legend, currently out of work and living a family life with a wife and a small kid, is tempted with huge money to step out of retirement to participate in a new kind of artsy porn film. He is not told the argument of the movie (as if porno films have such things) and the mysterious director, one Vukmir, seems totally off the rocks. But since he needs the money he agrees to do it. Unfortunately, his misgivings turn out to be very true, since he is soon forced to participate in increasingly degrading acts, a nonstop parade of horrors (including, and I suppose I'm giving some spoilers here, killing a woman with a machete while he is having intercourse with her, the rape of a baby and of his own small kid) for which he will eventually take revenge. As I said, I think there is some talent here, but is so sick that is not worth it. What is laughable is some reviews I read which try to justify this film as a metaphor or an allegory for the rape of Serbia during the war or something like that. Believe me, there is nothing here about that.",A Serbian Film
34,MrGKB,"Pardon me, but I have to throw up...",6,21 October 2013,"...at least some sort of comment on this film to justify the rating I've given it. Other people upon seeing it will very possibly just throw up, figuratively or literally.I've seen some rude films in my day, and this one has to rank right up there with the worst of them. Murder, torture, rape and sexual degradation, incest, necrophilia; ""A Serbian Film"" pretty much covers all the bases, and then some. I originally smacked a ""2"" on it, but after a day or two of contemplation I realized I was being unfair. In truth, it's a very well made movie in every technical aspect, convincingly acted and carefully directed and scripted, and despite being in-your-face transgressive and depraved, manages to present the most unlikely of sympathetic characters, no small task. If it didn't conclude on the lowest of notes, it might well be even more highly rated than it is here on the IMDb.No, it's the sheer nihilism of the film that ultimately dooms it to being a curiosity, a cult film at best with a very limited following. Never mind the writer/director's reported intent to comment on his country's society, ""A Serbian Film"" remains an apt expression of George Orwell's dystopian warning to humanity: ""If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever...and remember it is forever,"" as well as the truth of the aphorism, ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,"" often attributed to Edmund Burke. I won't say I regret watching ""A Serbian Film,"" and certainly not the way I regretted wasting my time with ""Martyrs,"" but it's assuredly not a film for everyone, even indiscriminate gorehounds or fanciers of boundary-testing. It's a harsh, brutal tale that will test your faith in humanity, pure and simple. You've been warned.",A Serbian Film
35,mario_c,Reality can be stranger than fiction,8,27 February 2011,"Cinema is the 7th art. Art is a very complex concept that allows Humans to express their feelings and emotions, through plain fiction or through something based on reality. From this premise we can accept that movies can be entirely fictional (fantasy genre for instance), entirely based on reality (Dramas, etc) or a mix between fiction and reality. In this last kind of cinema there're those which are in fact based in reality but take it to the extreme to make us believe it's just fiction A Serbian FILM is one of them! A Serbian FILM is provocative, I mean provocative; it's shocking, and I really mean shocking; it's complex, but it also is based in reality, which so many times can be stranger than fiction! And what reality is that which I am talking about? It's the reality of the sub-worlds of pornography that nowadays reach unimaginable things to the common and banally mortal Human being Fetishisms, sadism, violence, torture. It's all a new world of slavery that some wealthy and respectable citizens of the civilized countries want to buy! Yes, because wealth and technological development has nothing to do with moral concepts and integrity and it's entirely proved that centuries of technological development didn't make disappear the Human beast that is inside in each one of us! The perversions, the desire for forbidden and weird things, the sexual fetishes, they are all there closed and deep inside our minds and they just don't get outside so easily because fortunately our society still have some moral concepts and common rules that control them, at least for the most of us but not for everyone!This film is just about that. It's about how pornography can be so perverse, cruel and sadistic, and I'm not talking about straight sex, I'm talking about real and brutal violence. The movie takes it to the extreme to put the viewer thinking: ""No, it's so absurd and perverse that it cannot be totally true"" At first sight we can probably think that way, but if we think a little bit about it, deep inside we all know reality can be stranger than fiction About the technical details A Serbian FILM has a very dark cinematography, as it fits perfectly for the thematic. At parts it has scenes of extreme violence and blood, but the shock is created mostly on the psychological side.I score it 8/10 because of the audacity this movie has showing us these creepy and dark sub-worlds that are hidden but at the very same time in front of our eyes!",A Serbian Film

As a matter of fact, however, this movie left me strangely cold. It's depressing and calculated in its shock value, the logical next step after torture porn flicks such as ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"". Instead of just depicting blood and guts, director/author Srdjan Spasojevic breaks sexual taboos: He shows the raping and slaughtering of women and children (without actually getting too pornographic. You see erect penisses, blowjobs, even the birth of a child, but no explicit penetration).If you're shocked by the thought of this alone, ""A Serbian Film"" will have the intended effect on you and disturb you. I, however, felt that the whole thing was kind of predictable and half as extreme as it was made out to be.Spasojevic is neither an unethical director, as some will claim, nor does he push the boundaries of what art is allowed to do. The depiction of violence has its end in itself in this movie. That makes ""A Serbian Film"" so much less powerful than other extreme movies such as ""Martyrs"" or ""Cannibal Holocaust"", where the explicit violence actually served a deeper meaning. ""A Serbian Film"" is neither deep, nor fun too watch, just shocking to a certain extent. That makes it interesting enough for the moment, but not too memorable in the long run.

40,melvelvit-1,An over-the-top shocker with the ring of truth,10,25 February 2015,"A retired, financially strapped porn star gets an ominous offer that'll set him up for life as long as he doesn't ask any questions about the kind of movie he'll be starring in... I've had A Serbian FILM hanging around in my DVD ""to see"" piles for quite some time and I'd heard enough about its ""extremes"" to question why I even bought the damned thing in the first place. Now that I've had the pleasure, my initial trepidation was completely unwarranted. It's an excellent film that goes so completely over the top that I had no problem with any of the imagery ...per se. They say, ""there are some things you can't unsee"" but as far as I'm concerned, what's shown isn't nearly as horrific as the film's none-too- subtle message. It'd be pretty hard not to see A Serbian FILM as anything other than a brutal, nihilistic commentary on the state of a State that cannibalizes its victim status for profit (""newborn porn"" and a newly formed Republic, get it?) and even if this very dark film is only an allegory, all I can say is, ""Put the Iron Curtain back up.""Another disturbing aspect was that the film kind of has a ring of truth to it. Of course there's kiddie porn and snuff films in real life and the sex industry is booming in Eastern Europe -as is white slavery and God only knows what else. I do know it's the ""gay porn capital of the world"", flooding the video market with films like MASTER OF THE SWORD, DOUBLE SHAFTED, and TWIN DEVILS, the last two starring the handsome Mangiatti twins (Fabrizio & Fernando, who get it on) and if the Eastern European sex industry can do that in ""legit"" porn, one can only imagine (or not) what goes on ""underground"". A Serbian FILM is a shocker, that's for sure, and its star looks a lot like Roman Polanski but I don't think I wanna go there.

42,dragokin,gore-porn with socio-political commentary,3,20 April 2013,"There are two levels for analyzing this movie.The first is the obvious gore-porn with A Serbian Movie being one of the best within the genre. It even has a story which borders with crime thriller: A retired porn star is hired for an artistic porn movie under the condition not to know anything about the script. The question is, of course, whether porn needs a script no matter how artistic it is, but the main protagonist will soon discover the true nature of art in his new project.The second level is not as obvious. The movie is called A Serbian Film and the authors stressed a point of it being simply a title. Well, why not calling it something else? Because there would be no media attention about a random horror flick. The title aimed at the popular opinion that Serbs were the guilty party in the wars during the downfall of Yugoslavia. Between the lines it even purports Serbian culture to be primal, if not primitive, and deeply rooted in incest and murder. Logically, this garnered a lot of negative reviews in the home country.A Serbian Film skillfully uses point-of-view camera, which is in line with contemporary web-porn, but at the same time achieves a very dark atmosphere. The soundtrack is extremely good and some scenes are never before seen on-screen in a feature film. When you see them, you'll know exactly which ones i meant.However, the main question is what artistic merit might be in gore and porn, no matter how good the story behind is.

43,t_atzmueller,"A rare case where a ""Torture-Porn""-flick comes with an important message",8,16 November 2014,"Like most (re-)viewers here, I do fancy myself a fan of horror-films and, yes, occasionally indulge in the more extreme side of the spectrum. ""What will they think up next"", is always an interesting question. ""What will come after ""Saw"", after ""Human Centipede"" and ""Martyrs"", and how far will producers go to feed their gore-hungry audience? So, I did expect a hardcore Splatter-Film with a ""very"" and an exclamation-mark attached. Director Srdjan Spasojevic didn't promise too much, but he also gave me something, that I had not necessarily expected: A very fine, deep and thoughtful Film that goes beyond the splatter-for-the-sake-of-splatter that dimwits like Eli Roth make a living with.Technically ""A Serbian Film"" is way superior to most 'mere' Torture-Porn-flicks, be it in the way of cinematography, atmosphere or the actors themselves (all are superb). Sure, the film is shocking, even to the more jaded aficionados but at the same time its way more thought-provoking than the newest ""Saw""-Gore-Fest. Sure, the film will attract its fair share of gorehounds, who come for the kicks alone, but considering the backgrounds of the film-makers, there is also a deeper message inside. Most countries that once formed Yugoslavia have gone through their share of (civil)-war, ethnic cleansing and atrocities. Many people have asked about the meaning behind pumping the protagonist Milos (Srdjan Todorovic) full of sex-drugs, to a point where he's barely human any longer or capable of controlling his own actions. The answer is simple: War will do this to a person. Don't be fooled by clean-cut army-recruits or pseudo-heroic military marches. When it comes down to ""doing the business"", violence will become a drug that becomes way more uncontrollable than anything one could purchase on the black-market. Look no further than the middle-east as I'm writing this here: when cutting off the heads of people and letting kids play football with the remains become the norm and uploading those atrocities to the internet is perceived as honorable by the perpetrators, one really doesn't want to imagine what people might do that would actually make them feel ashamed. I assure you: it won't involve an animated plastic-doll of an infant and it won't be scripted either. At least that's the message I perceived from watching ""A Serbian Film"": War 'fornicates' (pardon, IMDb won't allow me to use the actual word) everybody, virtually from childbirth to the dying day.In essence, to all those who slam ""A Serbian Film"" for having gone too far: don't slam film-makers; slam those who for whom violence is a glorified reality.

But then I got mad, since I am a horror movie fan on a quest to watch most if not all horror movies. I also eat Lucio Fulci's movies for breakfast, so I thought to myself, can this thing really be that bad? Scariest part of this movie is the fact that it could have been good, but a lot of really not necessary exploitation ruins it and holds it back. As for the gore and violence, I expected worse considering the notoriety of this movie. It's nothing you won't be able to stomach if you watched some porn and a lot of horror movies. Movie even tries too much to be shocking, so it sometimes even feels funny for all the wrong reasons in some scenes. Movie is filled with feeling of dread and features a interesting story, but, no matter how much I try to praise it, it remains a fact that it's just trying to be brutal for the sake of it, and that's so cheap. It also should be noted that this movie was made by a man who of all people, as the interviewed Serbian actor in the interview you can read on Wikipedia says, has no reason to critique the Serbian community, considering his background. I will also repeat what one reviewer said. We, people living in Balkan, don't make movies like this. Not just with themes like this, but in a technical way. It doesn't feel like our movie. And it makes sense, because people who worked on it are just interested in selling stereotypes about Balkan and earning fame and money on that. What's more, main actor built his career on movies like that. Taking all of this into account, I have to give the movie 5/10. Is ""Srpski film"" the most disgusting commercial movie ever made?

47,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,A milestone for pulp cinema,9,3 May 2011,"First, I want to say that I disagree with everyone who argues that this movie is simply made for explicit shock value with no other purpose. I can quarrel this with two simple points: 1. I am a male porn performer myself and immediately found there to be a handful of real concepts, thoughts, and fears to relate with Milos on within the first fifteen minutes of the film (desensitization, your position in a family setting as a pornographer, to take the job or not to take the job, etc). Now, I'm sorry if you have no way of grasping that he is a realistic and admirable character in believable shoes, but he is. The level of relation I found with Milos shocked and impressed me and made me wonder if either that screenwriter had had some personal experience as a porn performer in the past, or instead was just a really intelligent person who was able to grasp it without actually experiencing it.2. People like this actually do exist! Snuff is not a fictional concept. There are people that are this sick out there - and involving massive sums of money and pornographers does not seem far off at all. If it weren't for people who took the time to make films like this for us, how would we be aware of the twisted possibilities of what could happen to us if we're not too careful? On top of these opening defense statements, there are a bundle of things that make this a fantastic film.First of all, the cinematography - the look they got in post - the editing - it all looks stellar, tasteful, and comes off as being done by true, inspired professionals. This is probably the best looking and feeling film that exists that could be considered anything even nearing the ""torture porn"" sub-genre. While I would never call this a straight-up torture porn film, it certainly does feel similar when it delves into it's scenes of sex and violence with ""S&M tones"" - that's putting it lightly... I would never call this a horror film either. It's FAR too human and psychological to me to be categorized in a genre that has become so stale and brainless. If anything, what separates it from most torture porn is that it's torturing your brain, not just your eyes by seeing prolonged sadistic violence on it's own. There's a lot more to this. It's more like psych-torture.I also found the performances to be perfect for this film. Milos of course steals the show, see-sawing between the calm likable man he is and the primal beast he becomes when ""working"". Marko was also another standout with his performance - very discomforting with his bitterness towards Milos and his uncontrollable lust for Milos's beautiful wife. While Vukmir and his henchmen were the cheesiest, they still filled their shoes very effectively. Majority of the female characters didn't have much personality, but I believe that was on purpose to go along with the mentality of pornography - and I found it very effective and dreamlike or nightmarish. I couldn't believe how many stunning women they found to cast for such an intense film - it only adds to it's surrealism.The score was impressive as well. Hard hitting, abrasive, electronic beats almost comparable to a score like that of The Social Network - and just as good. It made me feel even more engaged in the film and the character than I already was beforehand.Now, I know a lot of people can't handle explicit gore - but the artificial violence itself is a masterful art on it's own! To create an artificial scene of violence and make it believable and effective is a mighty task! And this movie is chock FULL of gut-wrenching ultra-violence! This is something that deserves recognition, praise... even awards. It's not an easy game, kids! I would love to go into detailed descriptions of the groundbreaking scenes, but I'll leave that to everyone else. I've looked through this message board and it's just chock full of spoilers. I'll just say that all the violence is extremely disturbing and realistic, and thus it's very impressive.Now I admit that I laughed plenty of times as an instinctual defense mechanism in reaction to some of the most over-the-top sequences. What else can I do as a human being? You feel disgusted, or you laugh. It's one or the other. If it were real - I would certainly not be laughing, but it's not - it's a effective emulation of what in reality would be ultimate horror. Because it's SO shocking and effective, I laugh, because I can't believe they pulled it off - or took my brain to this new place it hadn't been before. THAT, is something to admire.I would never tell anyone to watch this movie. But I will tell you that it is absolutely a masterpiece of it's own kind. Pulp cinema, if I had to call it anything so broad. A lot of people say they will never watch it again. Now, although it scarred me - I don't think I'm going to lock it up and swallow the key. It's too good to never watch again. But, it will be a long, long, long time before I do again... (Unless I have a sick friend who just wants to watch it WITH me THAT bad).I'd give it a 10, which it very well probably does deserve in the long run, but I just can't bring myself to do it.",A Serbian Film
48,room102,Only if you dare,7,15 October 2011,"I'm shocked to say it, but... I actually thought it was an interesting movie. This is the second time I'm watching it. The first time I rated it a 4/10. Now I'm rating it a 6/10. First of all, from a technical aspect, the movie is very well made: Excellent cinematography, score and direction that really give the film the intended atmosphere: surreal, hallucinatory and out of place. Acting is also very good, by the entire cast, especially Srdjan Todorovic and Sergej Trifunovic.As for the subject matter - I honestly have no idea how a movie like this could have been produced, financed and released. Can you imagine the director trying to sell the idea to the producers? simply impossible.What do I need to feel about a movie like that? I really don't know. One review in IMDb mentioned Cannibal Holocaust and I actually tend to agree - both movies have themes and plot that are unthinkable, both are repulsive and anyone from the ""mainstream"" that would hear about it would call you ""sick and disturbed"" for watching it - and yet, both are well executed and somehow manage to maintain some sort of realism to out-of-this-world ideas and absurd situations that could have easily gone completely comical in the hands of other directors. Both films should/could easily go to the top list of ""films that should never have been made"". The one major thing that separates the films is that Cannibal Holocaust used real animal and for that reason is extremely hard to watch (which is probably the reason I only watched it once and don't see myself watching it again in the near future), while A Serbian Film is obviously all make-believe.Both films should get a terrible rating, but both get a 6/10 from me, for good execution and bringing to the screen a good product that is really ""unfilmable"" (a term that was used in connection with several of Cronenberg films).6/10 Only if you dare",A Serbian Film

50,Meven_Stoffat,"Crueler than cruel, darker than dark, more vile than vile entertainment",1,12 January 2011,"A Serbian Film is an ugly, cruel, nihilistic and depressing movie- one I regret having seen. I definitely recommend you stay away from it- no matter how much you love ""shock"" movies, or if you can take ""sick, shocking stuff"". Mind you, I can stand shock movies. One of my top films of all time, Cannibal Holocaust, is a film that is considered a ""shock"" film, but it's more than just a film with shock scenes, as the ending challenges the viewer to question our corrupt morals nowadays. A Serbian Film does not do that at all, it exists only to subject its viewer to ugly, vile, and repugnant stuff that would make the Saw movies look like a teddy bear's picnic.A Serbian Film follows Milos, an ageing porn star who has taken a bit of a break from the ""biz"" live a nice life at home with his lovely wife, a translator, and his son, who is enrolled in singing classes. One day he is called to lunch, where he is offered a chance at redemption- a new porn film. His agent has not much info since the company prefers to keep its details secret, which leads him to question if he should do it or not. After his wife pushes a few buttons, he reluctantly agrees to star in the film and gets good and ready for the shoot.But things don't sound right- for starters, the man in charge seems to be a little sinister, and the moment the shoot starts, things don't seem right. The shoot is taking place in an abandoned children's hospital, and the whole atmosphere is creepy and disturbing. The situations involved are some of the weirdest he's ever seen. After an oral sex shooting day, he slowly begins to figure something is wrong with the shoot. It isn't until a nightmare he has, and an unpleasant shooting day where he finally decides to to leave the shoot for good. His decision is final after he is shown a video of a newborn infant being penetrated, which the director calls ""newborn porn"". Then, from there, things get worse as he finds out he has done sick things unconsciously after waking up with no memory.If you felt uncomfortable reading the second paragraph of the synopsis, I don't blame you, I felt uncomfortable typing it. I decided not to type the rest of what happens since there is absolutely no need to mention such disgusting, demoralizing and repugnant content. I'm sure most of the other reviews on here have done the deed, and without a doubt this film disturb even the toughest and most macho.I can't come down on the film too hard though, because I'd be lying if I said it wasn't well done. The cinematography is well done and there are some nice, dark and creepy moments here. The acting is pretty good, especially from Milos, and that's where it stops. It's too bad a good concept got wasted on sacrifice of good storyline for sick, disgusting and shocking moments. This takes up half of the film, and is just unnecessary and absolutely demoralizing. Likelihood I'll ever watch this movie again? Definitely never.To quote Ain't-it-Cool-News' review of ""Chaos"", ""Why do we need this s--t anyways?""",A Serbian Film

It's hard to believe that this film isn't illegal to have in possession, or that the film maker isn't locked up somewhere isolated and the key being thrown away. But more to the film, it is good, but not good at the same time. It does what it sets out to achieve, make you sick and disgusted, give you nightmares and protect your ""little boys hole"". Where it fails is obvious, it purely lacks anything outside of its grotesque story.

Of course, this movie try to shock and also share some decadence feeling about the situation of Serbia, and also the lack of moral values. Usually, following the urban legend, we understand that snuff movies entertain some people who likes how someone dies. And this one, try to use this premise (some people likes this stuff), present with some social background (Serbia in decadence, a family with a bizarre past), and a filmmaker who looks a mad scientist. The filmmaker character is weak. Also, the script is weak. We can show the same idea using other heavy ideas, and the score could be excellent. I waited something heavy. My problem was read some articles about this film. And I was disappointed. I wait a second part. The end is like the end of a rape and revenge movie. But you can be darker, and show more.

I only knew that this had been MULTIPLY labeled as the sickest movie ever made in all film history. Of course, if I had started realizing a bit in the movie that it was going to be bad, I wouldn't finished it, since I then wouldn't have to see all the kinds of disturbing s h i t. Well, I guess the movie was just too engaging to stop me from keep watching it. So I started and was excited (though in a very, very nervous and worried way) and very soon I can sense everything will go for the worst. (I mean, you can even see it already at the plot) And after the HORRIBLE rape scene 35 minutes in, I felt so incredibly disgusted. I just could NOT BELIEVE MY EYES. And it got worse for every scene. I won't spoil the ending, but I know ONE image there that it took really long time to shake out of my head, that's how scary it was. The actors are creepily convincing, the cinematography is fantastic, the dialog is brilliant... Heck, I love EVERYTHING about this film. Sure I can understand why people absolutely hate it for all their hearts, but I just wish they could stop that and just see it for what it REALLY is: A brilliant, original horror movie which succeeds in every way. Actually, I enjoyed it SO much that I ALMOST want to see it again, while at the same time I get that it could possibly be a mistake. This really is the scariest movie I've seen in my whole freaking life. What you maybe wouldn't expect though is that it's actually very funny at places. The """"newborn porn""-scene is, while it scared me when I saw it, when you think of it, very fake. I mean, seriously, if taking a look at it a second time I would probably laugh instead of turning of the sound so I wouldn't have to hear the screaming (First time I've actually felt the need to do that!) Plus, the character of Vukmir is laugh-out-loud-funny at places. He can even make you laugh at the MOST horrible moments, just because the things he says are just too damn absurd!

""A Serbian Film"" is a shocking and twisted descent into the dark world of porn. But it doesn't stop there.. Torture, rape and shooting a so called 'snuff' film are just a few aspects of what to expect. The story is intriguing and interesting from start to finish and there are a couple of twists that are surprising and shocking at the same time. The entire cast is amazing, the characters are so real it's eerie. You sometimes have the idea you're watching real people instead of actors. They all did a tremendous job.

It is sheer psychological terror and a film completely unsuitable for a cinema, only watch it on DVD and be prepared some scenes which may make you feel uncomfortable.We know what the film is about as a story - a retired male porn star who is prompted by need of money to do it again - but to do it in disgusting circumstances and against his better and moral judgement. The psychological terror extends to his Wife (who encourages him to become a Porn actor again) and even his young Son.there are many uncomfortable scenes in this movie and you will either watch it because you will get a kick out of a porn star perform or because you are a paedophile and the film will have some meaning for you (God knows what!)or because trhe promotion of the film will prompt you to watch it out of sheer curiosity, as my partner and I did last Sunday afternoon.This is a foreign language film, made I guess in the Serbian language with Serbian actors and filmed in Serbia. thankfully, though I am not always grateful in this case, there were English subtitles to follow but this was more a visual than a talking film and I could have followed the film without any subtitles.It has been said by many, and I do agree, that the acting and the story are both very good and it is also said that the film story 'smacks' of a psychological problem which the Serbian people may have as a nation resulting from the war with Croatia and Bosnia in the 1990s, not perhaps dissimilar with the 'chip on the shoulder' that Israelis have about their Arab neighbours. the film did seem to have a deeper message than the sex violence torture and gore concerning a porn star and his immediate family.",A Serbian Film

In this movie we may say that Serbia has answered and answered with vigor! Competing in stupidity, I guess that this film has beaten the most stupid Hollywood movies of that kind. I apologize to all sexually twisted minds, but do you think that just filming the first class brutality, rape scenes or some deviant sexual behavior would result in a great movie? Above all, acting and professional approach in this movie is below zero. I must admit I always avoid posting a bad comment on any movie made in Serbia. Being a Serb myself I know how difficult is to make a movie in a country which population is smaller than one of Los Angeles and where economy is much below, so I truly believe that any film made in Serbia is a true success. The problem I got with this film is that all the capacities that this movie had at its disposal went into the sewer of immature personal ambitions of its creator who apparently has a world film insight of a retarded kid. Due to that kind of perception he launched this ingenious gem to compete. Instead of cheep copying of some world creators at their best and worst, adding the flavor of European sodo-movies of the lowest art level, this director could have focused on film values: composition, careful plot development and acting as he exploited worst from the pretty solid crew. Shame for the country of shiny gems of European Cinema and its bright stars like Dusan Kovacevic and Slobodan Sijan as it is a real disgrace that the film uses the name of a great country as a prefix to its personal failure.

60,Radu_A,'A Serbian Film' from an academical point of view,6,22 July 2011,"I've written a book and some articles about film censorship, so given the controversy looming around this particular film, and its highly interesting release history in the UK (read wikipedia for more), I got my hands on a pre-release uncensored copy. What's very interesting is that apart from some suggestive shots hinting at pedophilia and the extension of the film's most gruesome, unforgettable scene, it's all there, only left to the imagination - leaving me with the question I've come up with whenever confronted with such a case: if censorship leaves certain aspects to the spectator's imagination, isn't the effect even more stimulating? Yes, 'A Serbian Film' undoubtedly runs for the title of the yuckiest film ever. Yes, it's definitely reveling in the very muck it pretends to criticize, i.e. the complete and total moral decay of our times. I would have very much favored an incorporation of the (presumably Western) consumers of the kind of pornography it deals with, for that remains the film's weakest aspect: the social commentary is quite accurate, but not sufficiently explored.And yet, 'A Serbian Film' is still unmistakably a piece of art. The technical specs are top-notch for such a limited budget. The acting, especially Sergej Trifunovic as psychiatrist-turned-porn producer Vukmir, is nothing short of (disturbingly) wonderful. And most important of all: the underlying anger appears to be real. I was in Serbia for a festival last year (prior to this film's release), and cannot help but remember how similar some opinions and stories I heard were to the views expressed in this film. That being said, I completely understand why Serbs were outraged at this film. Being born in Romania, which has an equal share of ethical bankruptcy, I must admit that if this had been made in Romania, and called 'A Romanian Film', I would be very very mad.This is one of those rare pieces of celluloid which will most likely not allow for any neutral point of view, like 'Mondo Can(nibal)e', or Pasolini's 'Salo', or the collected films of Catherine Breillat.

Its idea is simple - to enact a metaphor of being screwed from birth until past your grave. But movie is so much more than this - it challenges the viewer's complacency in fetishization of human suffering, it shows the destruction of family by powers that be; movie works on many levels but it is above all a middle finger of the filmmaker to not so much Serbian authorities, but to Serbian film establishment that is often guilty of self bashing for profit, and corrupt with nepotism and other ills that plague Serbia and many other countries. This will go over the heads of many western viewers, but this is in fact one very serious FU sent. Some of the best Serbian actors decided to take part in this, realizing the true importance of this project. Others, invariably corrupt members of the Serbian film establishment, were offended but not for the reasons you might imagine. Often misunderstood (the point of the film is not to show Serbs in bad light, there is irony that goes over heads of many such critics), the movie's seriously good cinematography, acting and other elements are in stark contrast with a seemingly exploitative but effective surface plot. But there is much more going on. That the movie managed to become one of the most notorious and even cult like Serbian movies of the new millennium, and remains popular in the West, is its enormous success, and in more ways than meet the eye.

I was only slightly more offended than watching Daffy Duck getting crushed flat by Bugs Bunny because this entire film treats itself like a cartoon! All of the scenes come across like joke. We'll if the movie isn't going to take the danger these characters are in seriously how can the audience feel disgusted, frightened, sorry for them? Even the most disgusting scenes of a children and babies being raped didn't even get me to bat an eye because they were just too silly.The best comparison I can give to this film is 'Cannibal Ferox' arguably the single most violent of the cannibalxploitation films. Just like 'A Serbian Film' it's obvious goal was the create the biggest gross-out possible. While I didn't enjoy 'Cannibal Ferox' I did feel something, horror and disgust, because the film at least took itself (somewhat) seriously. I truly believed the characters were in danger and experiencing real suffering. 'A Serbian Film' was just a two hour joke.Was there any hope for this miserable story? While it's impossible to turn this mess of a screenplay into a good movie it could have at least succeeded in its gross out goal if the film had taken itself more seriously.A perfect example of this is a scene where the ""hero"" is about to film a porno of him raping a little girl. The hero literally jumps out of a window to escape. This is so outright comical it kills any sense of drama about the act of rape.Another scene is when the ""hero"" hacks a woman to death with a machete while raping her. This seems like a Rob Zombie music video.The musical sore is a major problem which causes the cartoonish atmosphere. It doesn't even give us the basic calm destroyed by a shock. Instead it's just a consistent electronica beat. Then why even have a musical score at all? There were also many outright sloppy errors. For example, the porno production crew are using obvious digital camcorders. Yet much of the story is reveal when 8mm video tapes are discovered. I haven't even seen an 8mm camcorder for 15 years! As I said we clearly saw them using digital camcorders anyway.The worst possible feeling you can have to a movie was that it was boring as sin. That's what this is.",A Serbian Film

The movie fully fleshes out the main character. You feel like you do care about him and his family. The film really takes the time to build all this up. That being said, the subject matter really gets beyond sick.Basically, a semi retired porn star, Milos, gets a call to work for a rich guy and be paid a lot of money, if he will do a porn film without knowing what it's about.From the start, there are shades of kiddie porn. Milos is freaked out by it and won't do it. So when he says he's quitting, that's when things get bad.The director drugs him, shows him a movie of a rape of a newborn infant. Really, really sick, and should probably get the film banned.Then the drugs make Milos totally nuts and the director has him having sex and killing people while doing it and all kinds of stuff.I'm not going to spoil the rest. But it's intense. It is shock porn. They wanted to do some really sick stuff and they did.The ending wasn't really satisfying. I think it should have ended sooner than it did.I think the movie crossed a line with the kiddie porn, and just IMO, I don't think it should have been released. But like I said, the movie itself is actually well done, but the subject matter is a whole other issue. I'll be surprised if the movie isn't banned in a lot of places. And it's certainly a film that will be talked about for years to come and place Serbia on the map. But would you really want your country known for kiddie porn?

But does the disturbing content on show have a point? Or is it simply designed to shock the audience into submission?The filmmakers' message somehow remains amidst the aftermath of all that carnage, especially in the grim dénouement. No hope is offered in the conclusion; no lesson is learned by the principle characters. It's a bold move for such a soul draining experience to have no positive emotional reprieve, but that, of course, is the point. Milos and his family are exploited and destroyed by an organisation far too powerful for them to fathom and, in the simplest terms possible, the bad guys win. A truly worthy entry into the annals of controversial cinema, A Serbian Film has lots to say, but has perhaps chosen the wrong way to say it - the filmmakers' message morphing from an unsettling whisper to a primal scream that manifests itself as a cavalcade of extremely violent acts.

67,sinnerofcinema,A Superbly crafted Cinematic achievement: a Savage look into the bowels of depravity,10,11 November 2010,"Srdjan Spasojevic's ""A Serbian film"" maybe pornographic at times but its no torture porn like the SAW film series. Banned in Spain and censored in the UK, this foreign film is actually an intelligent and well crafted look into the head of a sadistic filmmaker and how far he's willing to go to achieve his art. Martyrs, Inside, Irreversible move aside, for there is a new film that takes the threshold for disturbing to new heights.Milos (Srdjan Todorovic), an aging porn star, is struggling to support his family through tough times in the thick of contemporary Serbia. But, when he is offered big bucks to star in a pornographic 'art' film helmed by psychologist and filmmaker Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic), he seizes the opportunity in hope to garner enough money to never have to degrade himself in a porno again. At first the shoot seems typical enough, with Milos forced to partake in petty yet somewhat bizarre sexual acts... But before long, Vukmir's direction grows increasingly sinister, as Milos is plunged into a world of depravity and filth, and forced to fight for his life in the horrifying nightmare that is 'A Serbian Film'.With a dark look and a very distressing feel, and often unsettling, this exercise in human debauchery will leave you overwhelmed. Rarely does a film reach extreme levels in storytelling depicting graphic images so inbedded into the fabric of its story. The results: a disconcerting experience the main protagonist and its audience must overcome to survive. Yet ""A Serbian film"" will mezmerize the viewer because of its fearlessness. The message is simple: man at his core is evil and given the power and tools to act upon that evil, he will create destruction. Art here is the instrument to showcase the potential a man has to get in touch with his true nature, a vividly sexual and ravishing one he would materialize from fantasy to reality. The essence and elements of this exquisitely creepy and aching film dates back to the biblical times. yet at its core there is a contemporary take on all ten commandments as they are applied through storytelling mode designed by an scientifically looney type filmmaker obsessed with creating an art so extreme and brutal there is no preparing for it. The images are crude and repellent and sure to create very adverse physical effects on those who dare see this eastern European import. Think a grimly mixture of your most extreme and disturbing French films and you've got ""a Serbian film""",A Serbian Film

70,Hawkensian,"Some say that 'A Serbian Film' is transgressive, but such claims are rather tenuous.",5,5 November 2014,"The tempestuous cycle of critical thought that surrounds a genuine transgressive piece of art begins with an initial reflex action of disgust and anger that gradually matures into reevaluation and appreciation. It's been seen many times before, whether it's Michael Powell's 'Peeping Tom' (1960), which effectively ended Powell's career only to be championed rather undeservedly years later by powerful figures such as Martin Scorsese, or Bret Easton Ellis's 'American Psycho' (1991), an almost unprecedentedly violent book that was reviled by readers, critics and feminists alike only to be considered a postmodern classic some years later.A Serbian Film claims to be an allegory, director Srdjan Spasojevic said during FrightFest that 'Pornography is used as a metaphor for the everyday job, a job where you're exploited by the ruler of your destiny all in the name of feeding your family' He may be sincere, however I suspect that this is just guff he's using in an attempt to justify his absurdly violent, sadistic film. Rather than it being 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971) or Nabokov's 'Lolita' (1955), the content of A Serbian Film is more akin to John Waters' 'Pink Flamingos' (1972), both films are merely a parade of obscenity that seek to revile their audiences, only the former takes itself seriously and the latter most certainly doesn't.The film follows Milos (Srdjan Todorovic), a retired pornstar living with wife Marija (Jelena Gavrilovic) and son Petar (Luka Mijatovic). In what is a familiar narrative structure, Milos is lured out of retirement by the promises of big money to do one last 'art film' that turns out to be a series of horrific snuff scenes.Unlike many of the exploitation films of the 70s and 80s, the film is well made. It features decent performances from the lead, his wife and the slew of supporting characters. The cinematographer Nemanja Jovanov also deserves kudos, the shots both interior and exterior earlier in the film are attractive and the shady locations in which the horrors occur are captured and lit in ways that create a nightmarish quality. Unlike the classic exploitation films that inspired it, A Serbian Film's aesthetics also benefit from a modern, striking high-definition sheen.Once Milos is heavily drugged and the production of the awful films begins, 'A Serbian Film' becomes a series, almost a montage, of absurd sexual violence that become increasingly strong, with each new scenario of outrageous violence trying to outdo the last. I didn't find 'A Serbian Film' as disturbing as some have, its scenes of baby rape and penile penetration of eye sockets were just risible in their eagerness to offend, I consider films such as 'Cannibal Holocaust' and 'Salo' to be more jarring and visceral. The final 15 minutes or so, however, present the viewer with a genuinely devastating situation, even if it is rather absurd.A Serbian Film has provoked many strong reactions which is understandable, however they aren't of the shouty, irritating knee-jerk variety that permeated the release of Ellis's 'American Psycho' or 'A Clockwork Orange', because unlike Srđan Spasojević's 'A Serbian Film', those works actually had something to say that its unthinking, perpetually outraged detractors refused to acknowledge.49%www.hawkensian.com",A Serbian Film

73,eonbluedan-1,A sad case..,3,15 January 2011,"I love extreme cinema; I'm a fan of David Cronenberg, Takashi Miike, Gasper Noe (to a degree) and Pascal Laugier, the latter of whom brought us the wonderful ""Martyrs"". I watched ""The Human Centipede"" without batting an eyelid, ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" are child's play to me, and so it is fair to say I'm not a prude, and I don't react in an over-dramatic, over-sensitive way to this type of thing. With that point made, I will say now that I would not recommend this film to anybody. Let me begin, though, with a few of the things that I did actually admire about ""A Serbian Film"".I can genuinely see (though some would argue this) that there was an honest and sincere attempt here to make a critique on Serbian life; there is a visual metaphor intended, which is why much of the film plays out with a sense of hyper-reality more akin to a David Lynch film (though I stress I am not comparing these two film makers at all). The film is shot rather well in HD, put together professionally, and the nasty, gory parts look pretty convincing. In short, the director does know what he's doing, as far basic film-making goes. The performances were nowhere near as bad as I was expecting for a film such as this, and I can see that the lead man, his wife, and the director in the film, are all probably regarded as serious actors in Serbia. Most notable, the music was well used; the grinding, industrial soundtrack gets under your skin, but would actually work even better if it had been set against more appropriate cinematography; as it stands, it frequently looks like a Nine Inch Nails music video. This brings me nicely to the points that make it so bad.I mentioned the lack of synergy between image and music. The film's idea is exploitation, the music is exploitation, and yet the shooting style is polished and perfect, an awful choice. When you watch ""8MM"", like the film or not, one of the great effects it has is to make you feel dirty, to get under your skin in the worst way and stay there. Despite the graphic nature of certain scenes in ""A Serbian Film"", the gore being well done, the music perfectly enhancing that, watching such a good-looking piece does distance you a bit, and dulls the exploitation effect. Now that's not to say that certain scenes didn't get my heart rate up and make me feel uncomfortable, but it was nevertheless not as powerful, due to the chosen film stock and style.I had no problem with the infamous scenes, as some seem to have. These scenes are graphic, and hugely uncomfortable to watch, not simply because they are bloody or nasty (I can watch that fine); their effect is powerful because of the context, in certain cases the dialogue, and the metaphor that is being laid out. In other words it is the subtext and what the scenes make you feel, as opposed to simply what you are being made to watch, that have the impact. It is only the fact we know this is fiction that makes watching them bearable; you are able to rationalise and know that what you're watching is not real. In what seems to have fast become the most infamous and controversial scene, the idea presented is actually not as graphic as some would make out, the act only really being inferred as opposed to fully shown, but what you see and hear is enough to shred your nerves. Whether you can take the ideas presented without switching off is a case of personal boundary, I suppose, but I would be lying if I said that I did not find the scenes powerful, tough, distressing, and that they didn't drive home the essential cultural premise of the story very well.The problem occurs close to an hour in, where all sense of that premise starts to get lost. The film quickly becomes incoherent, absurd, and even darkly funny; though not the intention of the scenes, there were a couple of points that made me laugh out loud. The film loses you as an audience, simply because it has no restraint; they try so hard to make something graphic and extreme, hoping this alone, driven by a premise of a political comment, will make the work important and crucial cinema. Instead it becomes ridiculous. So yes the film goes too far, but not in the way a more conservative type might suggest. For all its controversy and nastiness, in my opinion the film's biggest crime was to become silly, which is a sadness, because up to a point, as nasty and flawed as it is, I did understand what I was watching.This is a film that I wish I could say is not for everyone, but which I admire, as it IS a film of ideas and anger, a volatile reaction to the state's mistreatment of its people, and fascism that has plagued the country's history. Sadly, I have to say that a potentially powerful piece of work was undermined, solely by the filmmakers turning it into parody.",A Serbian Film

The bad and the good of this movie turn out to be its opposite. It's so bad and brutal in its surrender to aggression and violence that it turns out to be good, and so good to show it in its execution that it turns out to be bad, victim of its own content.Some will say it is bad because it opens the precedent to a new level of cinematographic dementia, claiming that people already unbalanced may fantasize to turn real the macabre ideas presented on screen and that such movie should have never been maid not to happen a nutcase in life imitating art (which already happened with other media, for sure), rating this movie 1/10 immediately with all the vehemence that the film itself conveys.

And I agree...So to be just and fair to myself I rate it 5/10.WARNING: This movie, technically, is on the highest level, being well produced, paced and edited; it is evident that the director knows very well what he's doing, how to do it and what he wants to show.

78,Corpus_Vile,Welcome to the dark side... And I DO mean dark...,9,14 July 2010,"Milos is a retired generously endowed porn star, settled with his hot (if slightly creepy) wife and young son, and if truth be told, is rather bored with his non porn lifestyle. When an old co-star contacts him and offers him an extremely well paid job for a few days shooting, Milos readily agrees, and is soon introduced to slightly (and by that I mean very) addled director Vukmir, who has a sinister Serbian style '80's earring to show how evil he is. Milos is slightly concerned (Vukmir is clearly a loon), but attracted to the large cheque, he agrees to go on with the show. It's at this point that things begin to get very very dark indeed...Any self respecting horror fan will have heard of A Serbian film, and will probably have two pertinent questions:1) Is this film half as extreme as it's made out to be? The answer is a definite yes. If taken at face value, A Serbian film is downright evil in tone, never mind mean-spirited-I'm talking Neo-Nazi pedophile devil worshiping sex murder levels of mean spirited bile here. Bleak, dark, sleazy and without a single likable character in it, from Milos himself (who at least isn't irredeemable) to his rather odd wife, to his even odder police officer brother, (who has one or two unhealthy obsessions of his own) it also pushes the envelope just about as far as it can go in terms of content. The now infamous scene involving a baby, is mercifully brief, and rather shoddy in regards to FX. However, this is actually a blessing as the concept is truly nauseating and just plain depressing, although in fairness, one can sense the filmmakers threw this one in purely for its shock value. (mission accomplished btw)2) Is it actually any good? Well...yes, actually. Although the plot is nothing special, it boasts surprisingly high production values, and is nothing if not absorbing via its sheer depravity, and retains a nicely unpredictable feel to it, as after the first hour, you're prepared for almost anything.Ultimately, A Serbian Film is nothing more than a contemporary exploitation film, and is more interested in shocking as opposed to making a heartfelt social commentary or statement, but boy does it deliver. Any fan of extreme horror or exploitation shouldn't feel short changed here, as it throws in pretty much everything but the kitchen sink in terms of content, and in tone, has yet to be surpassed in vileness.The first 45 minutes or so takes its time to set things up, to the point where any exploitation fan may start getting fidgety.However, the second half is quite simply a descent into hell, and unflinching in its portrayal of the dark desires of human nature.It certainly won't be to everyone's tastes, horror fans or otherwise, (and I DO mean this) but anyone looking to have their jaw dropped should look no further, because in this regard, A Serbian Film delivers in spades.Ye have been warned....",A Serbian Film

82,cyberknight,Art and/or Exploitation,1,22 June 2017,"""Srpski Film"" (Serbian Film) is Art, no contest there. I've read some people complaining about exploitation of imagery... I disagree, because it's all fake (very obviously, by the way), so it was clear the director wanted to shock using ideas, not visuals. If it is good or bad, or if I personally like it or not, those are other completely different matters.The film starts ""warm"", with a sex scene without actual genitalia shown, then heats up quickly, when it shows that it's a very young child watching it. Immediately after, it cools down with a lot of talking, without anything happening, which was supposed to build up suspense and develop characters, but I, personally, found it pretty boring, after the shocking beginning.When actual action restarts, it heats up slowly, then abruptly blows up with all kinds of sexual abuse being recorded, including a ""newborn porn"" (quoted like that), rapes (female and male), ""snuff"" (sexual mutilation and murder), incest (with a drugged child) and necrophilia (this one, as a final twist of the plot). Genitalia is gradually more explicitly shown (mainly obvious fake phalli, what is good, for one, because it didn't feel like watching actual porn), to the point a man is killed by having an eye socket graphically ""screwed""... But at that point, I was so bored that I couldn't care much about anything else that was shown.And why ""Serbian Film""? I didn't know that the main product of export of Serbia was porn... Or is it? Anyway, almost nothing is explained in this film, there is no background for any of the characters (even the protagonist, all we are shown is that he was a porn star, without any story about how he got there and/or why he left, making it hard to feel anything for him or his family when we see him voluntary and dumbly entering the trap, as if he couldn't find any job other than being a porn star...) Everything is just a pretext to shock us with the darkest side of the underworld of porn. I didn't read any reviews about this film before watching it, so I had no idea what it was about, except that it was supposed to be worse (in a good way) than ""Salo"" (that I also hadn't seen, then). The plot started interesting, about an ex-porn star trying to survive after leaving the business. Unfortunately, the uneven pace and a lot of forced acting put me down on it (like the ominous henchman, as stereotyped as possible, using shades even at night, to hide a missing eye, and the contractor, with his cheesy ""mad scientist"" talking). The shocks were not so shocking when I couldn't care about the characters. I've seen much more shocking scenes on entertainment films (slashing and slaughtering films, zombie films, war films and whatnot films).Actually, that's another problem of this film: it doesn't know what it should be. In the beginning, it plays like a ""slice of life"" annoying sitcom (e.g., ""Friends""), then turns into a cheesy dark mobster film, then the second half becomes a formulaic drug-induced delirious gore feast, ending with a comic slap on the face.This film is not afraid of telling an uneasy story, what is the only good thing about it. Sadly, it's badly told, not because of the ideas or the contents, but because the story is underdeveloped, boring and generally badly performed.",A Serbian Film
83,darksyde-63508,Not as bad as most reviewers want you to believe it is,5,7 May 2016,"I had this movie on my pile of movies to watch for awhile, and just recently decided to watch it. Admittedly, the only real reason I ever really wanted to even see this, was because of the reputation it had. A reputation for being one of the filthiest, disturbing movies out there. So I decided t give it a try, but it sat on my pile for so long, because it also had the before mentioned reputation. I admit, I expected it to start out nastily, but all it just started out with a child watching a porno. OK, not too bad. Then shortly after they show a scene of the lead character, Milo's brother, looking in the mirror as he masturbates. OK, not too bad nor that offensive.to be honest, it starts out quite boring, and I didn't see what the big deal was. And then it gets to the part where Milos starts his first day of filming, and goes to an orphanage for ""Abandoned and neglected children"". At this point, I started to feel a little uneasy because I had heard certain things about certain parts of this movie.but then, a situation is avoided and I thought OK, again I don't see what all the fuss was about. And then things start to take a darker and more disturbing tone, when in a series of segments where certain things aren't shown, but implied, Milos starts to figure out what exactly he's wanted to do in his role And then comes the part everyone talks about. The infamous ""new born porn"" scene. And while just the thought of something like that is indeed loathsome and vile beyond belief, the reputation of this movie is built upon this scene, and again while beyond vile and loathsome, its played up. Nothing is actually shown, as reading most reviews would have you believe, it is more implied. All in all, this movie nearly isn't as bad as everyone would like you to believe it is. It is indeed dark and much of the subject matter is disturbing, but during the first half I found myself coming close to turning it off, due to boredom.",A Serbian Film
84,peterpants66,Your limits,10,19 August 2013,"I think at this point in time we all have a fairly good notion that those involved in making porn at the high levels, the money levels, are really weird people. It hearkens the question of ""what is real"" anymore. More and more these days were brought up to that level with everything associated with entertainment. There's no such thing as a carefully scripted situation comedy, thats been shifted to various levels of ""reality"" shows that mask their illusion with shaky camera work and blurred faces. Millionaire families strut around on yachts and go anywhere they want in the world at the drop of a hat, everyone is altered beautiful. How about sports and all the PED scandals that have sprung up in the past decade, is nothing sacred? Definitely not. Never was, never will be, which is what this tortured little piece of depravity slapped me in the face with. I just watched this on YOUTUBE and couldn't help but think of how just a few weeks ago Kirk Cameron who i'm no real fan of, had a trailer for one of his recent god-flicks pulled from YOUTUBE for some reason, yet this flick and many other's stay? No you can't have a trailer for a film of spiritual depth that encompasses the quest for GOD, no sir. This movie concerns a male porn star who's semi-retired and enjoying a boring predictable life with his hot wife and son. He get's offered a job with a very secretive group of filmmakers that approach him with the possibility of making huge amounts of money to do an ""ART"" film. The script is invisible and all manners of shooting location as well as other actors are totally non-existent. Instead a car arrives at the main character's home and brings him to the location of the shoot, sometimes blindfolded. This film is shot amazingly, and even with the subject matter i was wondering weather or not this was going to be a ""shock"" movie cause it looked so beautiful. People draw comparisons to ""SALO"" but i don't see it, this to me was much more brutal. What bothers me about this movie is that it's pretty realistic. Most of the money used to make porn in the seventies was financed by the mob, probably even today it is. Which means that what makes it out to the theater and video store is just the surface, their is indeed a seedy underground of filmmakers out there making these horrible DEATH/SEX films with young actors and actresses with no regard for the trauma they initiate. You know why they make these movies? For starters it's cause there is a market for it, for the people at the very top level's of entertainment and wealth who want real ""art"". People with lots of money and lots of sway. The other reason why they make it is the same as the director gives in this film: because it's real. There is a huge parallel drawn between sex and violence that is always right in our face, some people just don't know it. Why are there scantily clad woman running around doing gymnastics at football events? Why is there some bimbo with a nice body strutting around the octagon between every round? What does a beautiful partially naked woman have to do with FIGHTING, or with FOOTBALL or anything their plastered on? Wherever there is high violence there is high heels, it's to condition us to buy into more and more violent behavior towards not just our own sex, but the opposite as well. And these movies will increase more and more till were all dead mutilated mail order bribes. I have come to this conclusion long before seeing this movie, but it just jumped all over me tonight after watching it. I had to lye down after this and just clear my mind.

89,f-rabit,Guy who made this is sick,1,23 March 2015,"This movie started well. But as it gets going it becomes a totally disgrace of a movie.Violence over violence. Free and unnecessary. Graphic horrible sex scenes...pointless ones. The end should be censured. This is one of the movies that should be banned, cause it's pointless and evil. I can't understand the motivations behind the director desire of making a movie like this, but I guess he must be in pain. Real and bad pain. This thing that I can't call movie, must be his way to deal with real bad and profound trauma. This ""movie"" makes me sick and I really enjoy gore horror movies. I felt ashamed when watching this and couldn't fall asleep after.",A Serbian Film
90,spotlightne,Shocks galore but remember it's only acting...,6,18 November 2011,"This is supposed to be a big bad film. But, oddly, it didn't shock me. Perhaps because it just seemed liked a really bad dream where anything was possible, so why worry or fear what was coming next. I don't know how to rate it either. Good? Bad? I don't know, but I did watch it till the end. Perhaps I just wanted to know what was gonna happen. I realised mid through there were no bounds, so curiosity made me think what next...Unlike most people, I wasn't repulsed by this film because I kept thinking 'it's only acting'. I don't normally do that when I watch horror movies because I like to get involved and believe that the horror is real. But for some weird reason, I couldn't get into this film. I was viewing it from a great distance. I didn't care what happened to the characters either. That said, I still rated it 6/10. The shocks don't weigh on it being better or worse.",A Serbian Film
91,eddie052010,Too much to handle? Not quite...,6,8 November 2017,"Undoubtedly one of the most controversial films in cinema recently, A Serbian Film has garnered a very polarised reaction over the years. Me personally, I feel that it is nothing particularly great or particularly bad, just OK. Let's explore why, shall we?Now one of my immediate positives concerning this film is its plot and pacing. Unlike most movies these days, it is happy to take its time to set up characters and story in order to provide context and develop the leads to the point where we care enough about their situations to get the audience involved. I like good old fashioned slow burners, and it's nice to see one like this, especially one done quite well. Now, there are some structural issues however. This mainly concerns the last third, whereby it becomes weirdly non-linear all of a sudden, of which doesn't serve the story or the film in any meaningful way. It feels done to make the film more stylish, but instead comes across as a major amateur writing mistake, as is expected of a debut.There are also other positives as well. The acting is very good from all of the cast, it develops a mood and atmosphere quite nicely, and it is quite well made for the low budget film that it is. Meanwhile, its themes on filmmaking, sexuality and exploitation can be quite interesting, even if it is a little on the nose. Mainly I just like how it is pretty much the anti-torture porn movie. Whereas most films in this genre sensationalise hardcore violence and sex for the sake of cheap thrills, A Serbian Film goes even further than movies like Saw and Hostel dared, all the while taking the fun out of it via the score which combines parts of a synth piece which sounds like its from a porn film with bleak and bombastic orchestral pieces, the general disgust most characters feel when encountering such violence as well as the general negative tone and vibes associated with such content. All of this combines to represent how generally disgusting, vile and depraved such violence is in the first place. It does become an interesting look at voyeurism, and even if other films have done it better before, the contributions of this film are fine.That leads me to the film's biggest strength and ultimate flaw: the controversial content. The film's outlandish and degenerate content has pretty much clashed badly with everyone: film critics, general audiences and film censors who have been perfectly happy to hack it to pieces all over the world. Now make no mistake, the film is extremely messed up in many ways, and is definitely not everyone's cup of tea in that regard. However, I do find it interesting how these same people are bothered by the violence and depravity in this film, but have no problem with the general sadism and lowest common denominator style guff in various Western and Hollywood movies, whether that be the endless sadism of say Tarantino's garbage, Natural Born Killers, Sin City, the list goes on. The difference is that this film is at least trying to make you think and doesn't glorify the violence whereas those movies are seeking to wallow in sadism for the sake of entertainment. I know which one is more concerning here.As such, I do like how the film is able to address many controversial topics including Serbian politics (with the newborn porn scene being a weird way of conveying how many feel that Serbia is a failed state for instance), the torture porn genre in general (in how bizarre it is that people enjoy such violence) and voyeurism in general. As stated previously, I also like how it is the anti-torture porn movie; by taking the genre to further extremes all the while demonstrating how awful such violence actually is. Given these circumstances, it's not a surprise that very few torture porn films would be released in this film's wake, given how high a bar this film set in terms of cinematic violence all the while undermining the pleasures of such violence to make further films in this genre seem rather redundant and nasty by comparison.However, its also the film's biggest problem. Why? Its way too obvious in what it is trying to say. The Vukmir character is clearly a grossly exaggerated caricature and commentary of pretentious European art-house directors, the violence in of itself is a not so subtle attack on torture porn and the final tirades of life imitating art and depravity being true cinema by Vukmir at the end come across as slap in the face obvious, and not subtly done at all. And while it does make the film mean it has something to say, it displays it all to the point where it becomes insultingly easy to figure out, potentially leaving further analysis off the table altogether, something probably the filmmakers would want to be done with their film. Also, some of the violence does come across as a little bit lowest common denominator, and ironically pandering to the audience the film is so keen to criticise. And some of the more cruder scenes are so immaturely done that it wouldn't shock me if Jay from The Inbetweeners wrote those parts of the script.A Serbian Film is nowhere near as bad as most of the biased press and film censors would say (of whom clearly have agendas of their own), nor is it as good as some of its ardent defenders would have you believe. It is an OK film, worthwhile of discussion due to its ideas and unique take on certain genres, especially torture porn. However, it is very flawed and there are far better horror films with social commentaries out there. So its worth a watch (provided you have the stomach for it), even if it is rough around the edges. A Serbian Film is an overall entertaining film that is worth watching.",A Serbian Film
92,AnusPresley,Hype sells,5,21 June 2011,"Indeed it does. It suckered me into finding an uncut copy. Let me preface this review by saying I am not shocked, offended, surprised or even repulsed by this film - so in that regard, I think the makers have failed. It was all rather ho-hum actually and I really don't know why this has been singled out for the attention that it has gotten. The Streisand Effect being what it is, the chorus of outrage is the best kind of advertising this kind of film can hope for. It worked on me. And this hyperbolic statement ""some things cannot be unseen"" repeated several times around the web makes me suspect there are guerrilla marketing shills at work.It is always curious to compare the verdicts of amateur reviewers to those of the professional critics on the mainstream review sites - a radical discrepancy in views should trigger the alarm bells. This is the case here, with amateur opinions being black and white - those that classify this as repulsive, exploitative garbage versus those hailing it as a masterwork of transgressive art. It is neither. The mainstream nails it quite well, the typical reaction is that it is a competently made film, if somewhat gratuitous, and does not seem to know what it wants to articulate (if anything at all), and that its nowhere near as outrageous as made out (certainly compared to Japanese shock cinema). This film falls into the same trap as the recent French effort _Martyrs_. It can't decide whether it wants to be art or exploitation and tries to be both. Always a bad idea. This, as with _Martyrs_, is exacerbated by high production standards trying to attain Hollywood style cinematographic perfection. In my book, exploitation and crystalline quality film-making are an automatic fail. If you are going to wallow in the gutter and drag the audience there with you, high production standards undermine the effort. These films need to exude grit, cheapness and sleaze to carry it off successfully. The audience needs to be made to feel cheap, voyeuristic and guilty. Italian exploitation of some decades ago understood this, so does the recent Japanese underground. Creating a big budget illusion just undermines everything.As for whatever message this film is trying to sell, I fail to see it. Yes, I am familiar with the horrifying history of the Balkans and its insane politics and internecine, homicidal hatreds. I guess this is what the quasi-Gestapo garbed film crew were hinting at, but hey, _Salo_ this is not. There is some pseudo-philosophical babbling about the purity of the ""victim"", again paralleling similar nonsense spiels from _Martyrs_, but all meaning is entirely lost on me. What is this in aid of? Filler? Self-justification? Too many cooks in the screen writing kitchen? Who knows. Does anyone care? I doubt it. While the film starts off well enough, after this pontification, about midway through, the film then ceases to be coherent in any way and becomes a mere clock watching exercise to get through.To me this film falls squarely in the ""I really don't care"" category. It is a ""see once and throw it in your archives"" type of film, definitely not a ""keeper"" worthy of revisiting for any added value. Where this film ultimately fails is by trying to be in a class above itself - poseur artistic pretensions and grasping feebly at intellectualised nonsense. Folks, it just doesn't work. These types of films need to be shameless, unapologetic and bankrupt - these films do serve a purpose as viewer catharsis - and only when they succeed at this do they become the stuff of legend. Dressing it up just ruins everything and this film will be forgotten before you know it.",A Serbian Film

it has some scenes that will forever be etched in my memories but still an hour after finishing this movie the only scenes I properly remember would be the ones in the first 30 mins or so of the movie
All the controversial scenes went past my head except 2
I had my eyes and mouth both wide open at those scenes and was wondering wtf am I watchingBut in the end I was like convincing myself to think of it as reel and not real and somehow it worked. This would haunt me at some point in the future maybe but for now it's just a movie I dared to watch and finished without feeling depressedYes I am a man with emotionsAnd yes some of the scenes are just plain wrong
But in the end I was just impressed that how on low budget they shot it well and the actors looked convincing
Fav scene from the movie would be vurmik explaining his artsyle to milos
btw not the scene where he visually show his work to milos oh god no not that oneIn the end just wanna say don't watch this if you don't want to don't do it as part of some stupid challenge some stupid friend of yours told you to

I have to admit usually when these type of sick movies come out they're usually too low budget and crappy to take seriously. This movie is the exception to the rule. It has good acting, good effects,a decent script, and some very taboo material that will affect even the most unaffected viewer. The movie uses ""art"" as a way to spread its depravity and I have to admit it worked in this case. I predict this will definitely will be a cult classic(some will love it, some will hate it) and it may actually open the doors for more risky horror flicks.The movie itself definitely had an artsy feel to it and it does cut some jokes at its own expense to try and keep the user focused on the dialogue so they don't lose all touch whats going on amidst all the violence/depravity going on. And it does have a story which most movies of this type lack. Overall a very well put together movie that touches some very taboo subjects. Love it or hate it this movie will be talked about for awhile as it stirs emotions in the viewer. Whether their good or bad the movie wins easily and you can tell by all the comments.

Seems more of a transgressive, rolling ball of manure, the new queen of camera cut-aways. For anything to be effective the key is suspension of disbelief at which this excrement fails horribly.Let's break it down:1. The infamous scene of the so-called newborn porn: forced, not even suggestive and so it fell flat, right on its belly. Also by that time I was so bored by the non-existent pacing I had to support my eye-lids with matchsticks to keep them open.2. Dick in the eye socket more than self-parodic. I laughed out loud. Shock value much?3. Father on underage son nooky reaction: oh, come on. Takes a lot of filming to be this cheap.4. Plot holes the size of Grand Canyon. 5.

96,solidgameboy12-1,"The Double Edged Sword that is ""Srpski Film""",8,2 August 2010,"Of the Last Decade of so, Horror had been on a downhill slope in a lot of the movies that have come out. Ever so rarely are we treated to a movie that scares us by what we aren't seeing, or the horrors of what Science, Mankind or any combination of the two can do.Horror movies have also, sadly, been in the can. With the last few years, Sub-genres have opened up, the ever popular Gore-no, which rhymes with ""Porno"". These movies are very easy to find; They typically have no real plot to speak of, shocking displays of violence and mostly naked people placed in spots to fulfill the idea that if you are going to sit in a theater for what you've paid for, might as well have a naked woman show up.From the last couple of months, people have been trying to say that the new controversial Serbian Film, aptly named ""A Serbian Film"" and (what I'll address as ""Srpski Film"" to avoid confusion) is either yet another grotesque exercise in showing excessive violence or classified as a movie with Artistic intent. Having finished it, I spent a few hours as this was being prepared to say I haven't got a clue what I'm going to say about it.The Story follows Milos(h), a former porn star with a young boy and gorgeous wife, who has fallen on some hard times. A Porn Star Milos has worked with, Layla, tells him of an offer to make the adult film of a lifetime from a director named Vukmir. Vukmir is a clever man, well educated of Milos work.When Milos shows up to perform in something he hasn't even a script to, he refuses. Vukmir, however, is not going to take no for an answer.This is the part of the movie where the term ""Double Edged Sword"" comes into play, I think. The question this movie asks you is if the content in the movie is mindless or artistic. The Answer is a difficult one to answer. If you say it's artistic, it almost makes you have to ask the question if you are necessarily Vukmir, who thinks his pornography is artistic itself.If you say it's garbage, than it almost invokes the question if perhaps you missed some point about the commentary to it all, which people almost all bring up when talking about this movie, and you went in for some awkward blood lust quota that wasn't fulfilled.In all honesty, it is a movie that cannot be submitted to the star review system of the IMDb. I will say that the movie doesn't have a great plot, all that interesting characters (With the disturbing exception of Vukmir). It is a graphic motion picture, with visuals that will make you feel absolute disgust, but whether you are disgusted with yourself for watching or the cast for filming it is kind of open. Surprisingly, the blood effects aren't in fire-hose mode, in that all the blood we see is almost near the end, which was kind of refreshing.Although it is a very slow movie. The content we are seeing isn't fast, and the conversation we hear is only so interesting, nothing is really background information on any of the characters (Vukmir and Milos are the only ones with backgrounds) so if you go, it would be because of the horror stuff you might have heard about it. The sex is almost constantly in view, but none of it is erotic, nor is it meant to be. It almost feels like it is kind of a satirical look at the feel of modern pornography.The Problem comes is where I stand on the movie. If I say I liked it, It's because of the last 20 minutes, which I felt to be the most tense of any movie I've seen in a long while. If I say I hate it, it sounds like I was looking for a ton of blood effects and sex and wasn't satisfied.I leave it up to you. If the trailers, story or hype sounds like something you want to see, It is your money. It is a difficult thing to say, but I truly think that in order for me to give a final consensus, a second viewing is needed, and I think I won't give this movie a second viewing for awhile.",A Serbian Film

WHY DID YOU KEEP WATCHING IT?,10,28 February 2019,"I have been reading a well written book about extreme cinema. It is not for everyone the genre is it? I have heard about this movie many times. I really don't think it will be for me. Unless I read other views who have. Extreme cinema is something I think is garbage. Or sometimes quite extraordinary in the thinking behind it and what it was trying to say.
For example Cannibal Holocaust. Ok to watch. Quite funny really. I really don't think the director was really trying to make a point. Just a cash in movie. I refused to watch any scene of animal killing whether fake or real. Find it vile. Many more movies have stocked me. Viderdrome still gives me nightmares. Braindead and Bad Taste I found hilarious. I have an open mind. But if I find something too much, crap, or film without soul I will just not bother. Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer I will never watch again. But I got it. Natural Born Killers though I admire Oliver Stone I just thought was an average film. This film is a bit notorious. Man Bites Dog? Good idea. Copied by other films almost breaching copyright contract. It was of its time. Not on my shelf of movies.This film is different as I have enjoyed different reviews. The best ones are 0 stars and how offensive and how never should it be watched.
Thing is most of those seem to have watched it. From start to end. I think that may say something about the film as it seems to have an effect. What effect I don't know.

98,ntj-film,What a wonderful world.,7,17 October 2020,"The recently retired adult filmstar Milos (Srdan Todorovic) can't quite seem to get a head start on what is to become the subsequent chapter of his life. Ever since leaving the industry he's mostly been hanging around the suburban abode, he shares with his beautiful wife Marija (Jelena Gavrilovic) and their ten year old son, Peter (Uncredited child actor), guzzling large quantities of booze and sampling his old porn tapes.
The household, however is facing impending financial difficulties, due to Milos' inability to find work, so when he's contacted by a former colleague Lejla (Katarina Zutic) who offers him a sit-down with a hot new director who's looking to revolutionize the porn business through his latest project, an highly avant-garde experimental adult film, whom he want Milos to star in, he quickly accepts.
When Milos first meets the director, Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic) he instantly offers up a million contract for Milos' participation but there's a catch, Vukmir will neither unveil the screenplay nor enlighten Milos regarding the story, which initially frustrates him but with the promise of a major payday, he nevertheless signs the contract anyway.
As production begins however, Milos finds that Vukmir creation is clearly a much more perverted depiction of pornography than even he cares to be associated with. But when he threatens to relinquish his involvement in the project, he becomes enmeshed in a sickening and ever escalating turn of events involving nauseatingly acts of psycho-sexual madness including paedophilia, necrophilia, torture, desecration of the flesh, from which there is no turning back. As the devilish Vukmir appalling acts of depravity spirals towards its horrifying conclusion, Milos realises that the grotesque narrative of Vukmir' wickedly debaucherous vision, might not exclusively pertain to him as a active player but might very well also include that of his family.Much have been said and written concerning Srdjan Spasojevic's shockingly vicious debut feature, A Serbian Film (Srpski Film) but just how much of the various watchdogs contributions constitutes valid constructive criticism and conversely intransient fire n' brimstone hyperbole, let's inspect...No matter how you cut it, there's no point in denying the film's controversial nature and savagely graphic depiction of sexual violence, what is debatable is the filmmaker's reasons for employing such unflinching tactics in their portrayal of the phenomenon.
After its completion and subsequent festival run, the director Sedan Spasojevic was quoted with saying that the film should be view as an allegory reflecting the anguish and suffering that the Serbian people had gone through in the Bosnian war and its aftermath and that they, for short felt ""f$c(&d from birth through death""
To which I retort; ""Why didn't you make that film than!"" Because A Serbian Film sure isn't it.
In my mind, there's nothing wrong with wanting to push boundaries, especially when you do it as effectively as this film manages to do, but writing off the perverse elements on display as simply metaphorical is at best disingenuous, at worse downright hypocritical.
At no point are we presented to elements such as poverty, class struggles, politics, corruption or the various social institutions within that region, there's simply nothing anchoring the story or its characters to the republic of Serbia (other than the spoken language) and for all intents and proposes this particular story could have play out anywhere in the world.
A Serbian Film is painted in broad strokes of un-nuanced black and white and as a result, the picture comes across as purely exploitative.
It's quite clear that the filmmaker's are going for shock value first and foremost, regardless of the claims of it being about so much more.
Any film that has a guy's retina penetrated by a monstrously erect penis will have a hard time playing the social realism card.The violence presented throughout the film, is just as hysterical and over-the-top as it's gallery of caricatures on display.
The worst offender being Sergej Trifunovic's goatee sporting Vukmir who seems almost animated as a character that isn't so much man as pure unrestricted Mephistophelian beast-man.
He and the rest of the cast aren't bad by any means, just severely embellished, an approach that only serves to further illustrate that the film as a whole, shouldn't be taken all that seriously.
However this certainly doesn't mean that the level of violence on display and the nature of it, aren't among the most extreme and controversial ever committed to film or in this case video.
But I would argue that this is exactly what quality exploitation films is suppose to do, although A Serbian Film does come frightfully close to crossing the line of what is acceptable to employ in the name of ""entertainment"".Technically the film is marvel to behold; it might even be a tad too glossy and slick given it distressing subject matter (which also debunks the filmmakers art-house claims) but it is nevertheless faultless executed, which is an extreme rarity for a film with such brutal content.
It doesn't make the film any easier to watch, mind you but as viewer I valued it quite a lot as professionalism is always nice addition in regards to cinema.
So forget any and all talk about art-house credentials and instead enjoy the film for what it is; a brilliantly crafted yet vile and tasteless piece of exploitation that is as savage and merciless as anything you could ever wish to see.
This may be too much but might I suggest a double-bill consisting of this and Tom Six's equally deplorable The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence (2011) for a guaranteed overdose of the sickeningly perverse.
Be warned though, it might make you crave the roughest of sandpaper instead of a loofah, the next time you take shower.Severely cut or outright Banned in most countries around the world, A Serbian Film did however get a completely uncut DVD and Blu-ray release courtesy of Cinematic Vision in both Sweden and Denmark back in 2011 (But since than a lot of retailers in both countries have opted to remove the film from stock. Controversial indeed)
Since the Swedish version was released first, that was the one I picked up and we're going to take a closer look at the Blu-ray now.
There really isn't that much to say as the release is a bare-boned affair, I'm afraid but it is 100% uncut which is the most important factor anyway.
The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen, aspect radio 2.35:1 and the print looks fantastic all round.
The soundtrack held in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS-HD and both are highly effective in a forceful and even balanced presentation.
The disc offers subtitles in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish and is a great release from a technical standpoint, at least.",A Serbian Film

102,tombrookes2007,Horror porn – exploitation filth that got all movie fans talking,8,3 March 2011,"This film is a disgust level test. SF is a trashy macho, exploitation Euro-horror extreme, that for most will come across as a teen dream filth fest. I enjoyed it, but like every other reviewer would not recommend it, as it is a sick voyeuristic shock project. For me it lacks the class, polish and purpose of films like Martyrs, Inside or High Tension.An ex-porn-star is hired to complete a 'secret' project. This nasty project constantly worsens, and descends into depravity, including vile sex acts including rape, necrophilia, snuff and incest. The man then goes mad with what he has to see and do, as the director raises the shock level limbo bar higher every 5 minutes. It starts off and constantly injects dabs of high adrenaline, with a consistent theme of creepy sinister-ism and dark porno.The film's justification attempts to capture and highlight a seedy world in Serbia, but it is left using it to shock and entertain, rather than send a message. The Serb war and suffering (rape and torture) are said to be the crews inspiration.The sick parts = sex with a newborn, child watching sex, rape, snuff and torture. What then film contains; Pornography, Nudity, and many sex scenes Torture, abuse and murder Rape – under-age sex and incest NecrophiliaCut vs Uncut – the UK and US versions are edited, removing 4 minutes of graphic sex and murder. The cut version still packs a big punch and has enough for the sparse interested film fans. It is near impossible to obtain the original uncut version legally. SF is a mixture of Hostel, Baise Moi, Martyrs and porn.",A Serbian Film
103,gillman11,"Confrontational, Artful, Fictional",9,29 August 2010,"Almost 24 hours since I saw the uncut version of A Serbian Film and I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about it so this review may be somewhat confused and I'll have to revisit it in the future.One thing I am definitely sure about is that this film is in the higher echelons of extreme cinema – it is up there with Irreversible and Salo, films that contain many of the elements of exploitation but whose production values and artistic intent make the transgression considerably more disturbing.I would potentially add The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael to that list but I'm still not absolutely sure how I feel about that one, two years later but again I simply could not dismiss it as exploitation (not that I've got anything against exploitation cinema, quite the opposite). It may be time to revisit it in light of my reaction to A Serbian Film.Other decent pointers for what you'll experience are if you consider it a significantly better made combination of Last House On The Left, Cannibal Holocaust, I Spit On Your Grave, Last House On Dead End Street – the latter especially, there are quite a few echoes of the second half of LHODES in here.I'd comfortably lay money that the filmmakers have seen Roger Watkins' underrated exploitation flick (short hop from ""I'm directing this movie!"" to ""This is cinema.this is film!"").From that, hopefully, you can gauge that its an exercise in endurance as much as anything as all of those films are.I consider myself hardened to fictional output, I know this is a work of fiction, years of film watching instinctively tell me that edits and switching POV mean what I am watching isn't real. Problem is that makes me difficult to shock (a trick something like August Underground manages to get around by removing the elements that help the cine literate to differentiate without really thinking about it but that's another story entirely).But there were a number of points in the apocalyptic final 40 minutes (from the ""newborn porn"" scene onwards) that literally made my jaw drop, I simply could not believe the audacity of the filmmakers and what they were graphically portraying on screen. I won't spoil it – despite the best efforts of our fascist censors, anyone with an internet connection is going to be able to see this uncut if they want to and frankly, it's a work of fiction that portrays illegal activity but that doesn't make it in and of itself illegal or harmful, it is quite obviously a film.Having read up on the film since, it seems the intent was to make a statement about the way that the people of Serbia the country are treated by their government. This is backed up by its seemingly incongruous title and the many allusions to the Balkan War and the Serbian people in the dialogue. What exactly the allegory refers to escapes me though. It could quite equally be taken as a diatribe on the dangerous effects of constant exposure to sexualised media and the mainstreaming of hardcore pornography.Then there are a number of allusions to Alice In Wonderland, from the white rabbit to the dress the young girl wears and she is even referred to as Alice at one point. The protagonist also drinks something that helps him ""grow"" but beyond that I'm not really sure what the point of the Alice allusions was.So, am I harmed by my exposure to this film? Categorically: No, its quite obviously a work of fictional cinema. Artfully crafted utilising the visual language of pornography and horror cinema but obviously fictional nonetheless. I would recommend it without caveat to those who like their cinema to be confrontational and thought provoking. It does kick like a mule if you allow yourself to care for the characters.Probably not one for a quiet night in with the family though.",A Serbian Film

A Serbian Film is a horror movie with decent actors and directing, and an ok plot. The violence, shock and gore factors are omnipresent. I don't all get the negative reviews about the ""sick"" nature of this film. Horror films are there to explore and exploit taboo issues, not to please everyone.

106,RobertLThorpe,WOW - Horror cinema with a social commentary,8,27 February 2013,"A part of me wants to hate this film, the human in me. The I don't want to know this world exists side of me. However, I know this world exists and this film brings out and takes to the next level the social commentary of ""Violence Sells, the more explicit we get, the more we push the envelope"" This film takes that stance that the more we see, the more numb we get so we have to push even harder to find that thrill in life. Most people wont admit to themselves that they secretly love watching car chases in the hopes of a crash, UFC has put an end to boxing, NFL has gotten rougher even though they implement rules to keep it safe, their are more fights in sports than ever before. Films are much more realistic and violent, video games and good ol fashion TV has gotten more graphic and violent and with reality TV, more real, even though they are faker than most TV shows. The fact that it is called reality TV says it all. Violence Sells, Sex Sells, Pornography is bigger than ever and we as humans are craving it, most in secret. What A Serbian FILM does is go so overboard that you cannot help but want to cry for the world knowing that this happens. If you can think it, someone has done it. This film is by far the best look at how far humanity has degraded itself that I have ever seen apart from the Faces of Death series which some say is real, others say is false. The performances are top notch, the reality, blood, sex and atmosphere is haunting and moving. Its darkness is only over shadowed by the love that Milos has for his family and the humility that his wife accepts given her husbands past. Their child, an engaging look at innocence lost to societies craving for MORE. Make no mistake, this film is horrific, intense, violent but I would not call it gratuitous at all, every scene flows from one to the next and makes perfect sense. The scenes which depict child pornography, necrophilia, and snuff films are carefully shot without being gratuitous, the film makers are aware of the difference of staying to long on a scene being overkill, they stay just long enough for it to sink in. Some people who are weaker of stomach will disagree but if you love dark films, but not SHOCK for SHOCK sake will understand. This film is not for everyone and I will not show it to my wife who would walk out anyway, she walked out of irreversible, but for those that understand themes, tones, messages that films try to make will love this film for being raw and spot on.",A Serbian Film

The horror on behalf of horror. It's a commercial version of the movies we don't want to watch, unless we are as sick as the guys who made this flick. Compared with A Serbian film, Pasolini's Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma is like Toy Story. The main reason to defend this movie is ""these things really happen"". Many things happen and nobody wants to watch them in a screen. No examples are needed. The only way to explain why this movie exists is that Serbia has been living in hell for most of the '90, and the people should be numb or indifferent to most of the horror and cruelty that can get in the most extreme movies that are distributed in that country.

109,Mr Nuff,Transgressive,7,13 July 2014,"Intrigued by the rumors of what some have called the most transgressive film ever (in the reviews of Deadgirl (2008) and others), I watched A Serbian Film. I was expecting a cinematic version of the aristocrats joke and it did not disappoint in that area. However, I mentally numbed myself before watching so it's difficult to review the acting, storyline, realism, pace, etc. that I'd ordinarily pay attention to. I wrote 7/10, but I'm really just guessing.Let's just say if you want to see some messed up stuff, check this movie out. There's gore, there's sex, there's sexual exploitation, rape, and the whole nine yards. Not date night fare.More words: Milos is a pretty likable character, although you know early on that he didn't ask enough questions about the job. Not sure about the realism because I don't know much about Serbian culture. For example, the wife's casualness regarding her husband's old job (porn star). I suppose the casting is a bit unrealistic, as every woman in the movie between 18 and 50 looks like a supermodel even though only two of them are porn stars.",A Serbian Film
110,Ben_Horror,"Yes, it's A Serbian Film alright – and a pretty crappy one at that",1,22 December 2011,"Movies are like bodybuilders: they're always trying to compete and outdo each other, have the biggest muscles and get the most attention. Even at that, you will always get one 'pee-wee', a former weakling who is so insecure and lacking any shred of common sense, he will walk through the door with muscles expanded to bursting point by steroids that almost say: ""Look at me, everybody!! Just look at me!!"" If this analogy can be applied here, then that makes 'A Serbian Film' the same peewee at the gym: it's the former hundred pound weakling on steroids who vying hysterically for yours and everybody else's attention.Milos, a famously well-endowed porno star (Srdjan Todorovic) wants to quit the porn business and settle down. But as of late, he has become disillusioned with the difficulties of life with his wife and child, and is financially in very bad shape. After a conversation with one of his former co-stars, however, he gets an offer he can't refuse: to star in a new movie and get paid tons of money for it. Unfortunately for him, said movie turns out to be a violent, sex filled snuff film and the aging porn star soon find himself in over his head in death, gore and filth. If you want to know exactly what the ""gore and filth"" is, here's a taster: a woman is beheaded by a man having sex with her only he continues to have sex with her corpse; another woman is smothered by a penis shoved down her mouth - while her nostrils are clenched shut; a man is sodomized while unconscious etc. Even if that's acceptable to you, then it commits the cardinal sin: the abuse of children. A newborn baby is plucked graphically from the vagina of a pregnant woman by a repulsive man who then goes and fornicates it. Yes, even though it may be a prosthetic baby, the filmmakers clearly went to a lot of trouble by getting the best possible sound of a crying baby to symbolize pain as it's being violated. As if that's not bad enough, this movie ventures into pedophilia for a second time: a child is sodomized by his unknowing father. We see a glimpse of blood flowing And on it goesAs movies go, it's competent on a technical level and is well acted, but it's just so damned tasteless. At the time of release, the director Srdjan Spasojevic alleged that among all the sleaze that's going on, there is actually a 'meaning' to this film, saying it was about Serbia and what's being done to its people, and also the totalitarian censorship. While this is all fine and dandy in theory for those who may have read those interviews, the message won't be quite as apparent to someone viewing it cold and with no prior knowledge. Clearly, the cast is game and in on the 'joke' – the director must have done a really great job in articulating his lofty intentions because you wonder how else he was able to pull something like this off? The fact is whatever the ambitions of the director, everybody else in the world would clearly need to have a PHD in mind reading to arrive at such a context, and the cast are left with egg on their face because they fell for it hook, line and sinker. In the end, whatever alleged message this movie or its director is trying to convey is lost amongst all the sodomy, rape and pedophilia on display. Again we come back on to the whole argument that a movie should be based on the story and what you can actually see; not on underlying meanings and what you can't. A movie shouldn't have to be deciphered, which is the primary reason why this doesn't work. If the director wanted to make a movie about Serbia, why didn't he do that then? Why hide his message amongst the pedophilia – not once, but twice? The point is, being a metaphor for something does not give you a license to put whatever you want up on a screen. There are boundaries. There has to be. The line has to be drawn somewhere.Let's be honest: the main reason this movie even exists is not to pass a social commentary on the state of Serbia, it exists only because of the determination of the director Srdjan Spasojevic to get his name on the map and hopefully the attention of Hollywood and a production deal. If this is actually the case, he might be hard pressed to find anyone who would work with him based on this steaming turd. Even taken as a movie, A Serbian Film is one heck of a slow, dull and boring film. It'll be lights out within twenty minutes if watched while tired. But at least you'll miss all the twisted visuals that are on display.Made by pornographers not filmmakers, A Serbian Film is a repulsive little movie full of repulsive characters. That it fails in conveying the alleged message it's attempting to deliver, clearly indicates its sole reason for being here. Devotees who think this is a good film/misunderstood masterpiece are at best fooling themselves and are at worse defending a film that revels in the rape/violation of the very young just for the sake of it. One comes away from the film wondering about the mindset of any parent who would authorize their child to be in such a movie. To show the rape of a child even once is bad; but to do it twice? Where is the context and the social commentary in that? In conclusion, 'A Serbian Film' is the little peewee at the gym; the hundred pound weakling who's so insecure he's resorted to steroids to get attention; that sad, lonely little figure, flexing muscles that scream, ""LOOK AT ME, EVERYBODY! JUST LOOK AT ME!""",A Serbian Film
111,m-elle-kat,It pushes the envelope...with a message,8,14 April 2020,"It was a well made film with good acting but obviously very dark. I was able to watch it because I already knew everything that was going to happen beforehand and I consciously told myself ""it's just a movie.""It shows parts of Serbian culture like ingrained misogyny and the role of patriarchy and how it shapes Serbian culture which is demonstrated through the incessant scenes of fellatio and male dominance. Zero cunnilingus. There's a quote which is that ""everything is about sex except for sex which is about power."" This movie epitomizes this quote. Notice how all of the perpetrators are men while most of the victims are women.It's not that far off from material that can be found in a high school genocide class or heck even some immortal tech songs. The sexual content is in my opinion what really pushes the limit.If there is a political point it is centered on deceit, lies, perspective and manipulation for what purpose and what aim though? It is certainly not ""art"" but something much much darker which can only be surmised to be sadistic control and power (referencing back to my earlier point.) There is always a higher boss that you don't even know the existence of until things go sour. At first Milos was the 'boss' or the perpetrator but he is just a victim. The director told him ""you're the only one in this movie who isn't a victim. Milos was leery right from the beginning but then he is drugged and tricked into playing the part of the 'perpetrator' which in this case led to him raping his own son. The on screen perpetrator is really just a drugged up victim himself. Then you think the director is the boss but he is killed by his own creation (Milos.) Then another boss comes in who you've never even seen before which demonstrates that the abuse comes from a very high up place and will never cease but rather will be continued by another more ominous, secretive and powerful abuser.",A Serbian Film
112,mezzb,"sick exploitation flick masked as a dark thriller with ""ideas""",3,12 January 2013,"This film has three goals. In order of effort applied: (1) to present an unrivaled amount of on-screen graphic sexual violence (2) to make some sort of statement about being Serbian in the twenty first century, and (3) to be a dark thriller. Having now suffered through this, I am going to guess that goals 2 and 3 were in place only to appeal to investors to get a decent budget towards their only real goal (1).As a desensitized horror movie enthusiast, I wasn't aghast at what I saw. It's a movie. It's fake. Make believe. And to be honest, the explicitness of it only emphasized the artifice. It would have been much more effective at making viewers uncomfortable if it had used style and suggestion, rather than graphic closeups, prosthetics and imposing musical cues.It also fails at Extreme Shock Cinema by being generally boring. Fans of shock cinema will likely FF their way to the three or four setpieces, say ""Oh no they didn't!"" then move on.So, maybe they reached their primary goal of achieving notoriety, but failed in any attempt to make dark thriller with actual ideas, and also failed at making a Shocker worth rewatching.

As disturbing as it was and unlike other movies of its type it actually had a pretty good story and great acting.

""Man, some guy totally rapes a baby, hurr hurr hurr, sick, bro"". A Serbian Film has become a piece of work that has become known for its graphic content, and not for its ""artistic"" vision or even for its plot, which is fine if you want to wear your heart on your sleeve and create a gory, depraved movie, but if you are - like the creators of this film - hiding behind some paper thin meta / political message to justify your motivation to depict such heinous acts as ""entertainment"", then I'm sure that this legacy must be pretty infuriating, no?Anyway, all that artsy sh*t aside, A Serbian Film also fails on the face value of it being a shocking exploitation film. It draws out all the stops - and then some - yet fails to be entertaining, or repulsive, or even hilarious in its own failure. The film is cold and completely devoid of atmosphere or dread; even the flat-out exploitative moments fail due to them being re-cast in a harsh, ""artistic"" light that pretends to have a message. Cap that off with the half baked ending, and I would classify this as the worst - and most over-rated - ""horror"" film that I have seen so far.So, to clarify: A Serbian Film is 100% shock value tripe for plebs who think the Saw movies are the pinnacle of horror cinema, and is completely undeserving of its rancid reputation.

The acting is very good. Not B-movie acting by any stretch. The story is good, the pacing, and the characters are interesting. The writing is good. The protagonist is likable, despite being a porn star. He's a loving father and even a good husband. In most good films the protagonist struggles with moral problems, and this guy makes most protagonist's moral problems look piddling by comparison. He is really struggling, and it's fascinating how it all unfolds. This film is an allegory for war, what decent people are reduced to, and what happens to them despite their best efforts to do what they have to do, and maintain normalcy. It's a struggle to create value amidst the insanity of existence, a struggle for survival, a struggle to maintain sanity while having to relinquish control to, or at least tolerate, the forces of evil. It asks the questions Who are we after we succumb to evil compared to who we were before, and Who were we all along? It's a deep film that hits you hard again and again in albeit shockingly unsubtle fashion. But its abominations are never gratuitous. What I especially like about A Serbian Film is its bashing of the hero persona in war. There are no war heroes. There are only destroyers, and those who are destroyed.

Think again, i reckon i have just witnessed the most disturbing extreme movie ever, and you know what, for the first time i have no idea whether to give this film a good review or a bad review, its not a film that you can enjoy, although it was very well made and preformed by the actors, so in a visual and technical term it was impressive.. The premise for this little shocker is simple, a semi-retired porn star is lured back to his profession to do this once in a lifetime shoot so he can make lots of money and secure his family, but he has no idea what the shoot will contain, so we the viewer have a birds eye view in the dark and very murky journey he goes through, as the porn shoot becomes more extreme he begins to realise what he's got himself into and the director has a shocking surprise for his lead actor in what he wants him to do, not to spoil anything (its a taboo busting subject) but lets just say that if you put Cannibal holocaust, Irreversible, Emanuel In America, and Martyrs in a blender, throw a baby in the mix and you have an idea what your letting yourself in for.....I know some people will be very upset watching this film and some people will demand that this film be banned, there are some scenes of extreme sexual violence that will anger some of the mainstream crowd, i just hope that the censors will leave this film the way the director intended..

When I first saw the trailer, it looked like nothing short of raw exploitation and shock and I was seriously angry. Reading more from different forums where people are praising this Human Centipede crap and saying this will out shock them all, I was even more against this movie. I couldn't help but to still be curious, even after hearing people either talk about the ultra sick content to it being some kind of artistic movie that is relevant to modern day Serbia. I had my chance to watch it and it was so much better than anything I could have expected.The review that really got me interested was on IMDb, it's called ""A story of smut, shock, gore, rape, murder and psychological terror!."" This guy had the right idea and spoke my language in terms of being a guy who has seen the sickest of the sickest. A hard part about reviewing A Serbian Film is talking about the plot without really giving it away. It's very well thought out and as strange as some of the characters are, they're really flawed and human. It's not the usual crap you see from guys like Eli Roth or Rob Zombie where caricatures are their idea of a fully developed human being. Simply put, we all know the basic set up, a semi-retired porn star gets an offer he can't refuse so he takes it so he can support his wife and son. Things get weirder and weirder by the day until he can't take it and quits. Well they drug him and he wakes up 3 1/2 days later trying to piece his memories together and figure out what happened.This is all built up around the first half of the movie and in the 2nd half is more about the search for what happened which is not pleasant. Everything from being drugged up to the point of a raged animal and unleashed on strangers to more situations where they keep pushing him closer to the edge. The beauty of it is that you have this movie shot in HD and the flashbacks have this very fast paced style, it's almost like Crank or Oldboy. In terms of content, if you've seen the August Underground movies then you aren't going to be very shocked, I mean yeah it is horrific at some points but the violence is much more mild but the rapes in Serbian Film are much more graphic looking. It's not like Antichrist where they bring in nude body doubles, thankfully they just use rubber man parts in the scenes that would show a penis. It looks a bit fake but I think using a fake one is more tasteful. Let's say if the 3 August Underground movies are the ghost chili of horror, A Serbian Film is closer to wasabi. Not that there isn't more they could have done, it's all a matter of context. AU had it's subtle plot about these serial killers filming their lives and Serbian was more a character study.My bottom line is don't watch this if all you want is the sickest and most brutal movie possible, that's the same reason 80% of the people who watch pirated versions of August Underground's Mordum hated the movie. Also don't watch it to expect some kind of world changing allegory because you aren't getting one, I mean yeah you see what a dump Serbia is from the war but violent porn doesn't carry that message, it just shocks you in ways most movies wouldn't dare to.

129,zuhairvazir,I feel damaged after watching this one,7,27 January 2014,"Unwatchable, unbearable, depraved, the stuff nightmares get their inspiration from. Having said that 'A Serbian Film' has effective iconography; it is a mythos for post-war, guilt-ridden, still crumbling Serbia. The film belongs to the new 'European film order' where art is shown in all its beauty and brutality.'A Serbian Film' is a stark reflection of the decaying standards of society in general. It has so much to say but manages little in terms of being politically correct with its insufferable plot and savage execution by first time director Spasojevic.No matter how piercing and tormenting the film is, it is because it removes itself from the facade of a soulless, merciless 'New World' machine, eating everything in its path, that even after the faith- altering climax, it comes out a winner; a political winner. It can easily be tried for war crimes and it is, through the vicious tongues of the conventional critic. They may call it the 'Worst Movie Ever' but it takes a lot for someone to hate something that much. It must have something to harass not just the sensibilities but also the most basic beliefs of the watcher.STAY AWAY or press play with an empty mind and let it stay empty for its entire 143 minute run time. That won't happen so take my advice and let it go.",A Serbian Film
130,tangietangerine,Milestone for controversial filmmaking,7,15 November 2014,"I've always been one to avoid controversial films or any film that has some kind of graphic and gratuitous violence (except for Tarantino films, which have always been dear to me). But once I started getting to know some other kinds of works, such as Gaspar Noe's, Lars Von Trier, Pasolini, John Waters. And I must say, it was John Waters who made me start to slightly appreciate controversial films. Anyway, after various experiences, I decided I was ready to watch A Serbian Film, which in my mind had always been THE milestone for controversial films.I had the expected reaction to it, all the blood, the violence (and the misogyny!), the pornographic gore and unimaginable horror...but I must say, the worst thing still remains the psychological terror we are put through during the movie. Not only the terror the characters experience, committing collective suicide at the end, but also the terror that will forever inhabit us for having watched those scenes, as well as in Milos' mind, seeing what kinds of cruelty and sickness we are humanly capable of.I've read about the movie and how many people say it is about the political background in Serbia. I've even read a native saying that he thinks this is the only true Serbian film he's ever seen, how it stays true to what happened, in a metaphorical way, to the people of Serbia, because they know how it feels to be unable to erase things that you've done, or worse, things that other made you do. It definitely isn't a movie I would recommend to people, it's a movie you have to discover by yourself and allow yourself the desire and curiosity to watch it, because it certainly is an unique experience, and those who enjoy psychologically intense and gore films will be satisfied not only by the creative plot but also by the astonishing filmmaking.",A Serbian Film

The second time I realized why I didn't like it, it got to me. It was shot well, the camera never strays away from what is happening on screen and often the entire background is black, there is nowhere for your eyes to escape to. This may have been the very factor that made me want to watch it again, you are stuck watching the pure ugly truth, nothing held back. The third time I watched this I realized the film has a well written unique story, it's ugly, taboo, depraved, powerful, and captures this heinous world we live in.I have worked as a Paramedic for several years and feel this movie is exceptionally intoxicating.

136,kirkwuk,10/10 - you will see nothing like it for some time,10,26 October 2010,"I rarely hand out 10/10 ratings to movies nowadays, but when I do, it is something which is very special. This is a review of the fully uncut version. A Serbian Film, the work of a Serbian director as a metaphor for his view on his country, is a very, very well made film.As a fan of horror, although this film should really be classed as thriller, Serbian Film is the most dark, disturbing, engaging movie I've seen which builds a tense and remarkable first half, and then viciously assaults the viewer with a juggernaut of blows. It masterfully build up characters Miloh, a porn star who is trying to move on from the industry, and his wife, a down to earth, attractive lady who shows her normality as a mother in strange circumstances. Finances aside, Miloh needs a big break. The camera work here is top-notch, you can't believe it's not being produced by an American company. This is Serbian, guys, and the way it's shot, beautifully, makes you feel comfortable that this is the work of a professional. Amazingly, this is Srdjan Spasojevic's first film as director. Miloh receives an offer he can't refuse from a director named Vulmar, for a new ""art porn"". Miloh is regarded as the best porn star after all, a man who knows the business inside and out. Miloh accepts the incredible financial offer but is concerned regarding the stipulation that the shoot will be entirely improvised. He knows nothing about the plot or what he's going to be doing. After being dropped off at an abandoned orphanage, surrounded by uniformed cameramen, Miloh soon learns the film he's starring in isn't quite as he expected.The first half preceding the controversial ""shock scene"", adds to the sheer horror and psychological terror. Vulmar shows Miloh what makes this an art film, at which point Miloh is utterly repelled, as are the audience, by the conception and immediate rape of a newborn. This made me feel angry, anxious, sick, utterly disgusted. I had to leave the screen and digest what had just happened. The act is shot in such a way that much is implied, not shown, which is pulled off that is it actually worse. You WANT to keep watching to see the director of the ""art porn"" get put to rights. And disturbingly, we are only half way through! Hollywood likes to leave the goods for the climax, not here - I was filled with more dread, and darkness, for the remaining 50 minutes. And, it got worse. The sheer honesty about child abuse was enough to shock this viewer, and there are three or four scenes in the closing 50 minutes which absolutely blew my mind. I felt I was the one being raped. I cared about what happened the the characters, and felt a degree of sympathy for Miloh, his wife and child. The character development here in the first 60 minutes was crucial to how I felt. To compare this to say a movie like ""Mordum"", does not even work. Srdjan Spasojevic could teach modern horror writers a few things because this is masterfully developed, and powerful. He got the movie essentials just right. Brilliant actors, well shot, a great score and most of all unnerving subject. This film has an unerving undercurrent of child abuse which just increases as the 110 mins rolls and ends in what I felt was the most well-shot, but downright hellish scene, involving a family reunion for the lead character. The loving family at the beginning contrasts to them being humiliated, humanised, praying for extinction. Incest and sodomy clash with orgasmic screams of joy and relief, in the most shocking of scenes which makes me want to avoid in future. This is shot in such a way that three sledgehammer blows are delivered to the audience in quick succession, not giving us the chance to gather our thoughts - we are being assaulted. We are the victims. This film wants you to know that.The utter misery, and cruelty, witnessed by the viewer in the last five minutes will change you. I have not stopped thinking about this scene, being so well done, so utterly horrific... I feel bad to even say I enjoyed this film, and other reviewers are too. Much like the Exorcist in the early 70's, this will be banned in many countries not because it's just sick, but because it is so very well done. For someone to produce this and have such an effect on an audience is indeed ""art"". A Serbian Film should be a template to Hollywood in developing modern, shocking cinema. We're not asking them to include child abuse into our cinemas but as I said, the director got everything spot on before the violence. Think of all the ""gore-porn"" movies of the past, and think of how many times you cared for a victim being dispatched. I can count those on the fingers of one hand. Srdjan Spasojevic's movie had me care what happened to 80% of the characters. Many are brought to justice, whereas others are victimised to breaking point. I'll give this film a 10/10. The way I feel having watched horror for the last 28 years, I have never heard myself say ""this is a film that comes once in a lifetime"". I hope so, my nerves can't take it again.",A Serbian Film
137,arus_royus,Extreme...,8,3 November 2011,"First of all I was surprised at the number of reviews of this movie. For shock ""value"", I'd give this movie a 10. As an overall movie, well it's not like your Forest Gump or Christmas Carol (great movies by the way), it is, and I believe it is that primarily, a horrific shock movie, with very well done acting, excellent camera work, and terribly well done effects.Second of all there are people like that out there in the world and they have to be fought and locked up for a very long time (even though I bet that most people, unless you are a Saint, would kill such people with their bare hands after seeing this movie, which in itself shows just how dangerous such people are). The movie is not glamorizing violence, not one bit. In fact it leaves you with a sick impression of just how low humans can sink into a mire of madness and violence.Well, I was tempted to give the movie 10 stars because it gripped/frightened/revolted me so much but I admit it's just to violent for me to do so and still feel like a decent person. The fact remains, it is the most violent movie I have ever seen and I hope nobody tries to top it, that would be pointless, because the violence exists purely to make you sick and pray to God to have mercy on the human race. If how ever such evil turns you on, then God have mercy on your soul. So only watch this if you have a strong stomach and a desire to know about the (very) dark side of human nature. For this movie is twisted and insane beyond belief.But then again maybe(maybe certainly) it is not necessary (or downright harmful) for most people to see this movie, even though it set's itself apart from the usual slasher, exploitation movies by it's deeply emotional involvement of the viewer... I could go on and on about just how horrible this movie is. Best see for yourself and make up your own mind.P.S. I do not understand people who claim this movie is pointless, this movie maybe a fictional story, but tragically such evil happens (hopefully not) everyday on this planet and being aware of it and against such evil is very important, to me at least, and this movie helps to soldifify ones position on such matters, not to look away and be obliovious.

138,djkbee,A movie you wont forget if you see the uncut version not the uk DVD!,8,13 September 2012,I'll start by saying i was lucky enough to see a downloaded uncut version before seeing the uk DVD released version which is heavily cut! For starters i recommend anyone who watches this film to make sure they see the uncut version as the director intended. The UK release DVD was actually the most cut film in 16 years & had 4mins 11seconds cut. If you watch the uk DVD release you will think this film is over hyped controversy and a piece of garbage (The way our UK British Board Of Classification want you to see it.) Let me say that i see no resemblance in this film to politics in Serbia like the director claims. I think it's an excuse to seem sane after making such a movie! Anyway you'll often see this movie in top ten most disturbing film lists etc. What i did love about this movie was its storyline... the sort of storyline Hollywood could run with if they had a super watered down version with high profile actors. The storyline gripped me (i wont go into storyline as I'm sure you already know it!) I loved the main character Milo the acting was top notch. This movie does indeed have some very disturbing scenes... the infamous baby scene is very shocking along with the ending of the film... the kind of ending where you guess it straight away but hope your wrong and totally stunned when confirmed right! I give it an 8 out of 10 for the story & the acting. If you love a bit of gore and violence then this is going to be right up your street to as long as you see the uncut version. The film also has pedophile elements in it to which i know upset a lot of people... i found it hard to watch at times but the pedophilia is mainly suggested rather then acted upon. The ideas suggested in the film are disturbing. The film had an impact on me and its one i wont forget thats for sure.,A Serbian Film

Cinematography and actors were overall great.Film lost me at various points though. There are multiple, ""What is going on?"" moments. Major shock/horror movie, but had some nice camera work.

Now try me."" And believe me, I then saw the movie which didn't leave me for a whole week. It was singularly the most disturbing, insane, graphic and brutal movie I have ever seen in life. Mix Irreversible and Salo, sprinkle some Saw over it and garnish it with Martyrs. You are halfway to making A Serbian Film.Holy sh*t...!!! At a point of watching the movie, I had a cliché' as to whether I should continue or just stop watching it. I shall not tell anything about the story. Nobody can, actually. Movies like Irreversible can be watched if you have an acquired taste. Well, A Serbian film is definitely an exception. Its way over the top.Anyone who can stomach extremely graphic content and deeply moving emotion might try this one.It is not a kind of movie you will love. It is a kind of movie you will fear and remember for what it tells you.And this is the point this movie makes, in an extremely depressing mood. That life will not always be what you expect it to be.

They are not separating personal feeling for honest movie opinions. The very fact that a movie made you feel such emotions says something about the quality of production.The trick that was pulled of in this film is that the director gives us like-able characters. The main character Milos, is very charismatic and appealing and his wife is sweet and gorgeous.

145,psionchronicles,A Celebration of Thanatos,1,22 April 2015,"Have you watched the film industry's recent race to the bottom (""Human Centipede"" comes to mind) and asked yourself what the finish line looks like? Here is that finish line, in all of its gruesome glory.Most recreational drug users won't touch heroin or crack or meth; they can look at any crackhead and see what the finish line looks like. Any addiction begins mildly enough, but progresses to a point where nothing gives you a fix anymore and you overdose and die. Some people can play with fire and walk away... but what about those who can't? I ran across this title on a list of ""controversial movies"". I check them out from time to time to see what the fuss is about, and not being one to settle for anything partial, I watched the uncut version. I figured I was 50 years old and had seen it all, in spite of a few reviews I'd read. Like most Americans, I wanted to make my own decision.The content of this film is as bad as it gets; it may be matched, but I don't believe it will ever be exceeded. I thought depictions of minors engaged in sexual activity was illegal everywhere--even in drawings and CGI, but apparently this doesn't apply to infants.There are millions of sex addicts out there who spend their days looking for ever more extreme things to get them off. Many go from risqué content to hardcore content to illegal and violent content... then what? Then film doesn't do it for them anymore and they move to acting on their fantasies. None of my sexual fantasies have ever involved violence or rape, but I can understand the progression that leads there for some--the endless search for bigger and more extreme thrills by breaking deeper and deeper taboos.If you have seen the same film I just did, I hope it does the same thing to you: force you to look at yourself. The fact that I even sought this film out makes me no better than the film director it depicts, the guy who pushes the envelope even unto his own death. From now on, when a movie is said to be extreme, I'm going to pay attention and take a step back. If you were able to watch this film without wincing even once.. if you consider this ""entertainment"", God help you.

146,boyd1955,Forget the hype/antihype cos this is a roller coaster ride of transgression,8,14 July 2010,"Lets get one thing straight from the start. No one got hurt and no child was on set and saw anything sexual or violent in the making this film. This is not in any way child porn as some people who obviously either haven't seen the film or are retarded have commented . Its nothing like Cannibal Holocaust , Visitor Q ( ? ) , or anything else its been compared to. I can totally understand that this film is a form of catalyst to try and purge the memory of what went on in all the violence seen in the wars that split Yugoslavia  I saw things on TV at that time that were as bad as things seen in this film  I will never forget the sight of a little girl being taken from the wreckage of a bombed school, her arm hanging by a small piece of flesh having been blown off  I'll never forget that. The fact is that it does happen in war  And probably all the things you will see in this film have happened in Iraq recently  Backed by our disgusting governments and multi-nationals  Its what happens when you give men ( and women ) nothing but encouragement to be the animal inside  They become animals. Things do occur in this movie that you never thought you would see on the screen  But its not done in any pathetic juvenile manner like in Hostel or any of those boring pieces of torture porn  In fact Eli Roth could do a lot worse than watch this and learn to make a good film. But it is not all unmitigated horror  There's a few laugh out loud moments and one great audience cheer out loud moment  Homages to Cannibal Holocaust, Nightmares in a Damaged Brain, Videodrome and countless Giallo's with the product placement. And let's be honest, the baby scene is just 2010's homage to D'Amato's ""Anthropophagus"" It's one hell of a roller coaster ride of a film that is a true piece of modern transgressive cinema. It doesn't need the hopelessly stupid camera-work that ruined "" Irreversible ""  It is intelligent rather than stupid like the second half of ' Martyrs "" which was really just a reworking of the directors earlier and far better film "" House of Voices "" The performances are great in a totally naturalistic way, apart from the one which I thought was odd  Until you see the end The only thing I would have changed was to have it stop at the end of the last shoot sequence and have a post title sequence where the survivors were on a train getting as far away as possible  I could have done without the last 5 minutes and that last line isn't THAT special But I didn't make it  Srdjan Spasojevic and his team did  And I respect his choice I'll be in the cinema on the first night watching this with an audience if it gets released in Britain  Cos there is going to be screaming and people running out and loads of fuss. But hell people  Its not real  And its so well done It's the first time I've been so affected by a film in about 15 years Its not a masterpiece  But it is Bloody Great",A Serbian Film

151,Suicide_Saint,Srpski film: Progressive Art,8,22 October 2013,"There is a reason that ""Srpski film"" or ""A Serbian Film"" was initially banned in so many countries that is not directly related to the levels of graphic sex and violence. With his debut film, director Srdjan Spasojevic issued a very clear and devastating challenge to the status quo. Do not be fooled into thinking that this is simply another extreme gore-fest such as the ""August Underground"" series or the elder ""Guinea Pig"" series. The actors in ""Srpski film"" delivered outstanding performances. The film also boasts solid cinematography, special effects, and an unsettling musical score.These intense and disturbing images serve to convey a very poignant theme of power and control. Speaking on this theme, Spasojevic indicated that the film was meant to convey ""...a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government... It's about the monolithic power of leaders who hypnotize you to do things you don't want to do."" This is not unlike Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"" which attempted to convey the corruption perpetrated by fascists after the fall of Benito Mussolini's Italy.""Srpski film"" unfolds, showing an aging porn star who is in need of money for his family. Given his state of desperation and small, lingering desire to take part in the activities of his past, he is easily manipulated into taking part in a film in which no details are disclosed to him prior to shooting. The film crew and director are either well-dressed or wearing secret service-like uniforms, representing everyday figures of power such as the rich and the police force and or military. Think of how Hitler was able to control the German people or how most of our governments control us now. In most cases, the very rich and powerful can do things that are clearly not in our best interests, sometimes horrific things, and we simply continue to follow orders in an attempt to maintain the status quo. Spasojevic's film brilliantly captures the notion of control and purposefully makes use of these extremes in an attempt to shake people from their apathy. In essence, he is asking the question: ""How bad will things have to get before people wake up and stop allowing themselves to be controlled by the rich and corrupt?"" If you have a taste for extreme cinema or are simply looking for something well outside the lines of traditional horror / Hollywood cinema, keep an open mind and give ""Srpski film"" or ""A Serbian Film"" a try. If you can see the horrors for the messages they truly convey, this should result in an unforgettable cinematic experience.",A Serbian Film

153,Movieboy_20,A horrifying piece of art.,8,30 October 2010,"Milos (Srdjan Todorovic), an aging porn star, is struggling to support his family through tough times in the thick of contemporary Serbia. But, when he is offered big bucks to star in a pornographic 'art' film helmed by the bombastic Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic), he seizes the opportunity in a hope to garner enough money to never have to degrade himself in a porno again. At first the shoot seems typical enough, with Milos forced to partake in petty yet somewhat bizarre sexuality... But before long, Vukmir's direction grows increasingly sinister, as Milos is plunged into a world of depravity and filth, and forced to fight for his life in the horrifying nightmare that is 'A Serbian Film'.I was left utterly speechless as the credits rolled. My jaw was dropped, my face was blank, I was mortified. The emotional toll this film takes on you is beyond extreme, it's profound. The last act is ridiculously gruelling; I was pushed to edge, arguably more so than I've been with any other film in my life. Everything was so graphic; incredibly realistic; immoral. Yet, despite how harrowed I was, I can't help but feel admiration for the creators of this repugnance. For one, they succeeded in disturbing me to the bone (something that rarely happens), and for two, they had the balls to make a statement about their dismay towards the Serbian government with a film as controversial as this. Vukmir, the pretentious director, was a cumulative representation of past and present Serbian political regime; at first he came to Milos with pseudo promises of wealth and prosperity, but as the lies slowly become blatant, it becomes clear that he has merely manipulated Milos into exploiting himself and everything he holds dear. Even with Vukmir's defeat in the climax, another more powerful director (or dictator) simply takes his place as he orders his thugs to rape the corpses of Milos and his dead family as the cameras roll. This a ballsy piece of cinema, to say the least.Surprisingly, the film is very competent on technical levels. Nemanja Jovanov's cinematography is crisp and sickening. He succeeds in making the third act a visually surreal nightmare and as well as capturing the atrocities on-screen with deft precision and flair. The performances are nothing short of fantastic. From the sexually ailing Milos to his sexually frustrated brother, the portrayals are realistic and intriguing. The screenplay is also quite decent. Despite arguably lagging a little in the second act, the writing redeems itself with one big, sadistic creative flourish in the final act. Whoever came up with this stuff is a morbid genius. Should he be congratulated or condemned? That, my fickle reader, you must find out for yourself.Overall, this is one memorable cinematic journey. I will never forget the harrowing ninety-minutes I spent sitting in the dark as my morals and ethics were systematically captivated and crushed by the eerie glow of 'A Serbian Film' as it played on my laptop. What is my general consensus on this film, you ask? Well, if a piece of art can affect me as much as this one did, it must be good.8/10.",A Serbian Film
154,5h4d0w,An unexpectedly important movie,9,19 July 2010,"I won't say much about how extreme the movie is because people have written about that over and over already anyway. Instead, I want to focus on something that apparently a lot of people don't pick up on but I think is THE point why this movie is great.""A Serbian Film"" is somewhat similar to ""Fight Club"" in the respect that there were those grunting ""Yeah, people bashing each others' skulls in - awesome!"" and then there were those more interested in the critical aspects and storytelling finesse of the movie. No offense to people following their primal urges, I just think it is important to try and enjoy and understand a movie on both levels. It surprised me that ""A Serbian Film"" even has that. I expected a simple, shocking movie that would only test me in terms of being horrified/disgusted.Instead... The intense exploration of human cruelty reminded me of what Bret Easton Ellis did in American psycho (the book, not the movie). Of course, here it is motivated by desperation and greed, not superficiality. To me, that is a great thing because American psycho is by far the best book i have ever read and in my opinion essential to any thoughtful person. More specifically, the criticism (whether intentional or not) of the way we perceive sexuality was outstanding. I usually find people/articles/movies/etc. talking about the evils of e.g. the porn industry preachy, annoying, uptight and far from reality. Sure, this movie isn't exactly close to reality but that's not the point. The underlying thoughts regarding sexuality are and that's what's important. And they have drastically changed my view on sex. I don't mean to scare off the more kinky people here but it might make you think about the direction you're headed to and what truly matters when it comes to sex. That's why I think that women giving this movie a bad rating do an extreme disservice to themselves and all other women (and they should really think more about it). Because the chance that men watching this are repulsed and think hard about the way they themselves treat women are in my opinion a lot higher than that they would get off on the things shown and think they should maybe introduce a little rape into their sex life.All of that said and considering that I found the movie to be very pleasant from a cinematographic point of view and also in terms of acting - what is it I find negative about ""A Serbian Film""? The soundtrack. Unfortunately, it is a bitter reminder that the movie was probably more intended for the ""Hostel""-audiences than the ""Irreversible""-audiences (a movie that i found almost as disturbing as this). If the soundtrack wasn't so distracting and pushy but low key (again - think drama instead of horror), it might have been taken a bit more seriously and not just discarded as some horror trash. Also, the atmosphere would've been even more intense. Which... I actually don't even want to imagine and maybe that's the real reason why they didn't do it. A step too far. But I would still say: go for it. Challenge them even more. They are in desperate need of that, whether they know it or not.",A Serbian Film
155,wolfcub7,"You can't be warned enough, so just stay FAR away from this film.",1,15 January 2012,"The trailer for this movie is FANTASTIC in some sense BUT doesn't give even nearly correct image of what the film really is like. I recommend to NEVER watch a non-American or non-British horror film after seeing only the trailer, because you may end up watching things you didn't want to & you can't unsee what you saw.The trailer doesn't include ANY sort of warning about incest, new-born baby being raped, necrophilia of the sickest possible manner & of much more such things this movie includes and much is shown in graphic style and explicitly. This film may be well-made in cinematic sense like atmosphere and all that but in essence this film is sick and nothing more.It seems this movie was done simply for shock-horror purposes but even if this was supposed to be ""metaphorical"", I do NOT recommend this to anyone. Even fans of shock-horror can find their kicks from less immoral content, while I see no valid reason for anyone want to stain their minds with images of the things this movie portrays. I mean......just stop and think about it for a minute; would it somehow increase the quality of your life, or make you happier, to get shocked by seeing a fictional imitation of a new-born baby being raped, a father raping his own 6-year old son...(not that the age makes much of a difference but just to be specific), and a guy raping a woman even after chopping her head off? If not, then why make yourself watch such things just because you like being shocked, not to mention if you don't like to be shocked? If seeing fictional imitations of incest, baby rape and necrophilia does actually increase your happiness or the quality of your life, then good heavens I hope you get the help you need before it's too late.The baby rape, necrophilia and incest are only a few examples of the mountains of immorality and sickness this movie throws in the viewer's face. I really think this movie should've been banned everywhere because this is utterly unnecessary and sick movie that has nothing good to offer to the world.A great cinematic aspect and success as shock-horror, does not redeem a thing that in essence has nothing but sickness to spread and when crossing the line to unnecessary extents.I do not recommend this movie to anyone, and I do believe that sane fans of extreme horror can do without seeing this. If you are not an obsessive/addicted fan of extreme horror, as in if you have a free choice - stay far, FAR away from this movie, for your own good. Because there's 110% likeliness you will regret the decision to watch this, and sadly you can't unsee what you saw.",A Serbian Film

But if you decide to watch such ""art"", then you will be deeply disappointed!
Because honestly, that's not even a movie! The first 50 minutes of the movie are just a prologue. You are just ""introduced"" into the plot, how the main character got tricked to destroy himself.
A lot of people recommended to me this movie. They even said ""hey Teodor, you should watch this movie, I know you like dark stuff, that's a treat for you.""""
And today I decided to follow this. I was encouraged by a large curiosity honestly. I watched 50 minutes of it painfully because nothing was happening. They just talked, made plans. And then I was hit by gruesome.
I can handle pretty much anything. I am not the kind of guy which sees something gore and I rush to the bathroom to throw up. I really enjoy it actually. Is part of the movie. It is ...... art!
But A Serbian Movie (or Film ... or Srpski Film whatever) takes everything to another level. A level of stupidity and gruesome.
Honestly, as a personal opinion: You NEED TO BE MENTALLY ILL and have serious MENTAL PROBLEMS to watch this movie and give it 10 stars, to enjoy it! You can't enjoy a movie like this one. That's not ART! That's not A MOVIE! That's SICK! That's a serious disaster.
I really really hope they used CGI in this movie. Some scenes are too difficult to watch, even for a ""veteran"" like me. I watched a lot of crazy movies, but this one is different.

158,guy_in_oxford,Boring pretentious exploitation snuff porn with political veneer,1,2 March 2015,"You know it's not about politics, really, when you notice that the males in the film are very ugly and the women are beautiful — given that that does not in any way further the alleged political discourse.You know, then, that the film is really about sex. In this case it is specifically about sexual violence and thrill-seeking. The political veneer is simply the wrapping paper, the rationalization, for making such a tedious and unpleasant picture.One might really stretch the powers of rationalization and claim that the males are hideous and violent because of patriarchy — that patriarchy is what makes the entire system of sexual violence possible. However, there are ways to make such a point much more effectively.As for the rape of the son, which is such a major focus of attention for reviewers... it's very obvious that it's staged from the moment it begins. There is no suspension of disbelief. This, coupled with the extremity of its snuff aspects gives the film a parodic and camp quality. It could be argued that this artificiality is somewhat redeeming, making it more clearly not about getting one's jollies from others' suffering.However, if that is really the point then why not have women who are just as ugly as the men are, or even just ordinary? And, why, most of all, spend so much time graphically depicting these things? Swift, who other reviews mentioned, got his point across without it. While not everyone needs to imitate him, there is something to be said for deciding whether you're making pornography or making art. This film is very heavily on the side of the former rather than the latter.I also don't have much appreciation for tying sex and violence together as this film does. In my opinion, sex is a beautiful thing. The heterosexual male perversion of it into something violent (a perversion that is becoming mainstream and quasi-feminist with things like 50 Shades) is something that I feel is quite regrettable. If only humanity could take a page from the bonobo book of conduct and treat sexuality a a healing process, a method of reducing conflict and stress — rather than the opposite.Even while humans pride themselves on their growing (ostensibly) sexual liberalism, with films showing actual sex between actors and films like this one filled with extreme violence, the venerable Puritanism still permeates most things. Rather than daring to see transgressive sex acts (such as incest between father an son) as being potentially positive, this film pounds the viewer with conservative ideals. It must be violent in the extreme for it to occur. For bonobo primates, sex acts occur publicly and involve all ages and all relationships. We humans, though, cling to our chimpanzee-like sexual violence. If you really want to shock and offend, then treat sex of any variety in a positive non-violent way! That will surely get your film banned in more places than this one is banned in.In other words, abusing sex to make political points, or to simply wallow in violence as entertainment, is something that doesn't impress me much. The film subculture of violence as entertainment is one I find boorish at best. It also does seem to be more appealing to heterosexual males than to homosexual males such as myself. I suppose the appeal of boxing is similar. It is a ""sport"" I detest. While people are offended by this film for its violence, how many are offended by boxing, kickboxing, and the like? How many play games like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter. There is so much violence everywhere. This film does not rise above that, as its political message is ostensibly meant to. Instead, it just sells more of it.",A Serbian Film

I'm a huge B movie fan, but there's something bizarre going on in modern horror cinema, and filmmakers have been toeing the line for decades-- now they're taking this gruesome exploitation beyond where it was ever supposed to go.

162,Spyan,Hard to recommend this one,5,4 June 2014,"When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares right back at you.Folks, this film is as nasty as its reputation. I've seen very, very horrid/weird stuff like Aftermath, Nekromantik or other vaguely offensive movies but this one takes the cake. I wont say it's good (""good"" being an adjective not once approximately insinuated in the film), but I can't say its bad, hence the 5. I'll take it for granted that people reading this review are well aware of the plot, so I won't go through writing about it. Worst thing about this film is that it's very well produced. Sure looks like this endeavor got a very comfortable budget, and all the people involved are professionals. The latter parts of the movie that aren't sunk in darkness are somewhat beautiful. If you don't listen to the dialog, or anything that happens on screen, there is about a total of 15mns worth of ""normal"" exchanges and heartfelt relationships throughout the whole film. The main actors are very (not to say pros)convincing. Yet beneath the pretty varnish of inspired lighting and settings (still talking about the first 20mns), this film traumatizes. And while repugnant and depressive, it's pacing and editing drags you to the very end. Quality production overall (but that's hard to confirm, since you'll probably only see it once).This movie should be (is, in some countries) illegal, and should not be watched by people under, or at least 25/30. One has to have a mature approach to the content in order not to be scarred by this flick.Here's a none-offensive way to think about it : the Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian people were ravaged by war (1992), and this is their catharsis. Civil war is not about tanks and bullets : its about the desecration and destruction of people. That's about how brutal and merciless this film really is.It asks all kinds of questions. Mostly to the audience and it's voyeurism. Its a movie about the making of an extreme film, so it involves the viewers and confronts them with their responsibilities...by pretty much the first frames. Smart move for a hard subject (the only redeeming quality of the film).Isn't that why we're watching horror films in the first place?The first and foremost question this film asks is - what can one hope for when witnessing the deepest abysses of human depravity? Can't think of a better answer than : nothingness.It's one of the only film I've watched that was completely devoid of any human value or respect, but one of the only ones that dealt directly with evil and depravity (to such an extent that it becomes almost a parody at some points, and that certainly helps the afterward-coping).I watched it once, used up a full week to think about it and get it out of my system, tried it a second time and stopped half an hour in. Now I enjoy Wes Andersons' movies even more.Be warned.",A Serbian Film

Well I wish I hadn't now wasted those 2 hours of my life for many reasons. 1) The storyline is basically 'past-it porn star signs up for a snuff film' 2)The film drags and drags on and then there is a disgusting scene blah blah..............

I've seen it several times and now want to chime in.First off, I don't need to go into any of the details of the film, you've heard it all and there's absolutely no need to go on about it. I've shown this film to many friends and always get mixed ideas about it but there is always one thing that happens, people have a hard time talking after forcing themselves to watch the whole thing. It never gets easy watching it as I've seen it a handful of times. It's like you know a trainwreck is coming and you can see the carnage before it happens but you simply can't turn away. And this is why I love this film.I can't stand the reviews that simply state this film is exploitation for exploitation's sake. Like this was made simply for people to be shocked and tortured. There's a thousand crap movies out there simply for shock and awe and this is definitely not one of those films. It speaks to the absolute cruelty of humanity, the horrors inside us that 99% of us refuse to see. That in the recesses of some people's souls these awful things reside and sometimes spill out into reality. There are evils out there just as sinister as this film portrays and we hate to even think about them let alone be subject to these visceral tortures on screen. And this is why I love this movie, it forces you to come face to face with that evil inside of humanity.I cannot recommend this movie to just anyone, it is a certain piece of cinema that most people couldn't sit through. It's a very tough film to stomach and it does sit with you for a long time afterwards. It's a film I will watch again to show others but I will not enjoy it. This is a film that I love because it is cinema in the finest sense. There is no joy to this movie, it wrecks your soul and leaves a certain dread inside of you that cannot be shaken. It is something Americans are not accustomed to and why I hate most of Hollywood. Life is not all roses and good endings, there are very dark places out there and we need to know about them to eradicate them.Is humanity ready to see the darkness to see the light or are we willing to shy away from these things and let the atrocities continue in the shadows? If you're willing to see the absolute horrors of humanity, then you should watch ""A Serbian Film"". If you can't stomach it, then you shouldn't even be looking at reviews of this film. Chances are that you have a curious idea about it and some part of you wants to see it. Trust me, that curiosity will bite you after you finish this film but I think it's affect will be something more than you'll expect.",A Serbian Film

People called this disgusting, messed up, and the most disturbing movie ever made. I was intrigued. I have been watching horror movies since I was three or four and have seen everything. All the great slasher flicks, exploitation and Asian horror films I could get my hands on for 22 years. (Im 25) Then I read about this movie. Newborn porn?? Decapitation and necrophilia?? Incest too??? What the hell I thought. The only reason I was hesitating to watch this was because of the ""newborn porn"" scene. However after checking out movie stills and knowing since I was a kid that movies are fake I figured; I should watch this. My sister was more hesitant to watch though. We finally sat down and watched it. Its not a bad film at all. We both enjoyed it and even said to each other; ""this is the most disturbing movie of all time?!"" If anything we felt this movie was painted by some reviewers to be more messed up than it really is. Frankly, this to me was like ""I Spit On Your Grave"" and ""Last House On The Left"" times five! This isn't garbage. The acting was great, the story was messed up but sadly believable and the effects were a solid ten in my book. This is not a movie though, I would recommend to someone who hasn't seen much horror and exploitation movies. I think someone who watches comedy, action or romance mostly should stay clear from this! I wasn't disturbed but hey I have watched thousands of horror movies for two decades! Watch at your own risk newbies to horror and exploitation. Is this the most disturbing movie of all time?

The reviews about this movie saying it was highly disturbing and disgusting made me want to see it to get a good laugh since all the last ''shockers'' either made me laugh or bored me to near death... I didn't get a good laugh I didn't laugh at all but I was glued to the screen cause it was indeed disturbing and very disgusting, you get to feel the main character losing his mind and to see his life being taken from him without any real hope for redemption... This is a strong movie a disgusting movie that leave you with the feeling of being sexually abused yourself. If you like shockers you're going to like that one, if you like to be scared or disgusted you will like that one. Plus this movie is a strong metaphor on a topic that you don't really get to see in the movie but thinking about it after watching it you can see how strong that metaphor is in the movie.

168,kerryhill123,An enjoyable film if you have an open mind!,9,25 September 2013,"A Serbian Film has been a much talked about film but I never dared to watch it. Nevertheless, with an open mind, I finally decided to watch it and I'm extremely impressed by it, I would go as far as to say that it has been one of my favourite films to watch this year. The film follows Milos, a semi retired porn star who lives with his wife and son. Financially,Milos and his family are struggling, so when he is contacted by a fellow porn actress about a porn film which offers him a hefty pay, he accepts, despite his doubts as he is not allowed to view a script or see previous work, little does he know that he has been caught up filming a snuff film. I thought the quality of film making was superb, the cinematography almost spotless and it was edited very cleverly. The script was simple yet complex and the storyline was beautifully original, and in parts relatable. I loved the characters and feel they clearly represent two different ends of society, with Milos representing the underhand of society and Vukmir being the authority and power. this film fantastically represents what desperation can drive us to do and how our minds can be warped making us agree to things we wouldn't think to do in our right minds. This film has a very dark, seedy and yet interesting narrative. Yes, in parts it is horrific and rather vulgar, but it is thrown in at the appropriate times and not as a shock factor but nonetheless it will shock and leave you with images and thoughts that will stick with you for weeks on end. I really don't see it as offensive as many others have, it is a film that you MUST watch with an open mind, it is a movie that makes you think no doubt!

However, this had lead to a lot of negative reviews of the film, with many probably coming from people who didn't even see it, but are trying their hardest to make sure this film has low ratings. However, it is not okay to say a film is a bad film based on the content of it. Look at A Clockwork Orange, one of the most critically acclaimed films ever made. When it was first released, was very controversial for its depictions of rape. Now, it sits very comfortably in the top 100 of the IMDb Top 250 list. Now, am I saying that this is the next Clockwork Orange? No, I wouldn't go that far. I'm saying that just because a film has content that may be unacceptable, it IS a pretty good movie. The cinematography of this film is very nice, and lighting is used very effectively in many scenes. It is a nice film to look at in terms of camera work and feel. The acting is also very good. Just the looks the actor that plays Milos can give are haunting, and everyone gives a convincing performance. The make up is also very good. I'm not going to get into specifics, as it will spoil the movie, but it is very, very good. Listen (or, read) I could go into full analysis mode, but I won't. I'll just say that in technical aspects, it's obvious that this film had a lot of effort put into it, and is more than just a ""shock film"". If you are interested in film and what it can do, check it out. But, if you're a wimp, don't.",A Serbian Film
173,hollyrowanmoore,Pushes the boundaries of film to the absolute extreme,9,7 May 2020,"I've heard from many people that this film is the most disturbing ever made, and yes I agree. It had some very risky themes that are disgusting, extreme and leaves imprints in your mind. However, this film was beautifully made with stunning visuals and really captured perfectly the atrocities that humans can commit. It had a strong ending which I was not expecting at all, and the main character draws you in throughout. A Serbian film really does test the viewers limits and promises to give a very bumpy ride. Many of the themes in this film are very disturbing so DO NOT WATCH if you are sensitive at all to rape, child rape, abuse and just downright torture. It was hard to watch at times, and the climax to the end of the film was almost unbearable. But this is certainly a film I will never forget. I will not be watching this again, but it's worth the experience as it shows the raw and real pain and torture of life.",A Serbian Film

There were nasty, creepy, violent, gory, lots of nudity, perversion & everything a normal person can hate. But still I enjoyed, knowing that, these are fake & nothing to learn from here.But...this movie...Oh my God! This is way beyond perversion. Raping a new born baby & brutally raping own son? (Decapitating while raping, that's watchable). But which kind of pervert can make this or act in this scene or enjoy this? This movie is EXTREMELY sick! Sergej Trifunovic (as Vukmir) is actually reflected the character of Srdjan Spasojevic (the Director). The sick & twisted mind of a maniac can make this kind of movie. I like GORE or Sick movie...but trust me...this is not GORE, this is not Adult porn...this is really something everyone should avoid. (Trust me, after watching this movie, couldn't watch any other porn movies for few days). It's something like, if you see a g@y porn without knowing and feel disgusted.Why Am I giving 2stars? For the making and acting only! Nothing else. Or else I'd beg IMDb to add negative marking.

If no, move on to question two.2. Have you watched The Human Centipede? If the answer is no, Go watch that first, and if you handled that okay, then move ahead to number 3.3. Do you watch extreme porn? If the Answer is yes, move onto question 4.4. Have you ever heard of an Aristocrats joke? If yes, you have a vague description of what this film is about, proceed to question 5. If no, go look up 'The Aristocrats' and you will then understand what this movie depicts in the most vile manner.5. Have you watched 'Anti-Christ'? If no, go watch it, and if your stomach is still okay, come back. If yes, and you weren't phased by Anti-Christ.

176,TodayIsTheDayOurSinsWillBeOver,"Pointless, and tries its best to be shocking under a guise",1,21 March 2011,"I first watched A Serbian Film uncut once, online, and then after that, it was removed from the site it was on (which was a good job, considering the site is very popular and has an under 18/21 audience). Was I shocked by it? No. Did I find it interesting or thought-provoking? Not at all. Am I a lover of a horror films? You bet. So now you must be wondering, well why did I watch A Serbian Film knowing what it was about then come on here and give it a bum rap. Well. I heard of it through friends and websites, and being a lover of horror movies, and a fan that likes to ""have seen it all"" I obviously was going to watch A Serbian Film sooner or later. First of, don't get me wrong, it's not the violence in this movie that makes me dislike it, it's how they tried to be so over the top about it, and in doing so, it makes it look like a futile piece of crap. Not including the film's so called ""political statement"" that is really only a guise for it to show its cheap scenes.Apparently, the movie is meant to show, or well, be an allegory as to how Serbian people are forced into doing things, am I getting this right or what? How their Government is meant to be controlling & how violent Serbia is? But all I seen was rape after rape in this so called movie that is trying to make this important ""political statement"", but we know underneath that's just a guise for its cheap exploitative purpose. For those who don't know, A Serbian Film is about this guy called Milos, a retired porn star, who is lured out into a black market porn industry with an offer for money. He has no idea what he will be doing, until he agrees to it, and thus the film begins there. Milos is dragged into various acts of sexual torture and violence. But as with most of the violence in the movie, it's over the top, and obviously, makes it look cheap and flawed.Sure, I ain't gonna lie, it's reasonably realistic (except the fake penis), but it's just one of those films were it has been so overly done, it's poor and the real purpose behind it is made clear in that. Of course the film seems to have gained a backing now of everyone that thinks it's the most violent movie in history. Well, it sure has a good attempt at this, but no, it's not.August Underground's Mordum does a far better job, and at least, it's not trying to hide its exploitative purpose like this movie tries its hardest at. A Serbian Film, in my opinion, is not a statement about anything. It's just another over the top exploitation film, which, might have gotten a higher rating from me, if the people who made it didn't make a guise for the over the top scenes in it, which is exploitative.There's one DVD release of it to date, and it's a UK release. It's not uncut, and I don't suspect it will be uncut for a long, long time. If you like violence, sure give it a go, but please, don't be fooled into this whole allegory about Serbia - it's just another exploitation film.",A Serbian Film
177,arisdisc,"Despite what you may have heard, a well made film.",8,15 February 2012,"Some of the reviews in here for this film are a hoot. It's hard for me to believe that the people who detest it so much weren't fully aware of its contents before viewing it. I'm not easily offended nor shocked, and although I was aware of the troubling scenes beforehand, I was curious as to how they could or might be executed. I love film. And I'm not dead set against one that will challenge me. I knew that going in and remembered that throughout it's running time. Initially, I figured this would be sloppy, dark and badly done. But it's not. Well made, aptly directed and for the most part the acting is solid. Special effects were handled expertly as well. Disturbing? Yes. Not for everyone? Judging from the comments in here, I'd have to say yes. Entertaining? Not for the majority. But I found myself immersed in this insane 'world' of these vile characters, quite comfortable in the knowledge that the director was willing to do 'anything' to move the story along. That made it work for me. If you're the type who can handle something different, and can remember that everything that is graphically offensive 'is' simulated, and...after all, it IS only a horror MOVIE, then by all means see it.

179,walterradunsky,"Artful, Insightful, and Intelligent",8,24 September 2013,"As so many reviews attest to, I think that many people are too brainwashed and absorbed with their own self-righteousness to give any kind of insightful or honest review of a movie like this. A Serbian Film may not be pleasant to watch, but I believe that it is a brilliantly constructed and meaningful movie, one that gets more profound with each new reflection. Not only does the film artfully illustrate how unseen persons in power can manipulate, perverse, and ultimately destroy the lives of others, but it makes an insightful statement about the interaction of human beings and film itself. A comparison of the films (mainstream as well as pornographic) that entertain and arouse us today with those of the past clearly shows a sharp increase in both violence and raunchiness, with an audience that becomes more and more desensitized as filmmakers continue going to greater extremes to make that audience still feel something. A Serbian Film does well in not only illustrating this situation with increasingly brutal and perverse scenarios, but crosses so far over the line that the already desensitized viewer may feel deeply disturbed enough to understand how sadistic and immoral society, under the current momentum of politics and entertainment, may become. Like a great dystopian narrative, A Serbian Film provides a creative and insightful, albeit disturbing, critique of what we have become by showing us what we may one day be. Unfortunately, like so may other films that make a powerful statement, this critique is either unseen or willfully ignored by those concerned about proving to others how righteous they still are as they look further for depictions of violence and perversity that will give them greater pleasure.",A Serbian Film

183,damirradic14,brave film,6,23 August 2011,"First of all, it's very brave film. It have motifs almost nobody dare to use today. I mean on sexual interests of minors - girl in puberty and male child, son of a protagonist. Authors of film clearly say - minors and children are also sexual beings, children unconsciously, minors very consciously. Freud knew it, most of educated and uneducated people knew it, but today, since last two decades, almost nobody knows it anymore, in public at least. Because minors and child sexuality became taboo in Western culture in last two decades, because of hypocrisy. So I really respect braveness of authors to engage with such issue.On the other hand, film is pretty derivative, but surely has right models (Amenabar and Park, for example) and its own touch, especially in strong final scenes of family raping (protagonist unconsciously rapes his own son, sweet innocent child, while protagonist's evil brother has huge pleasure raping his brother's beautiful wife), and then family suicide, and finally suggestion of necrophilia raping of dead family. I am pretty sure that mentioned Chan-Wook Park would appreciate this grand finale.Have to say that I didn't like scene of rape of newborn baby - it's pretty pointless so I see it as shock because of shock, and I wasn't even shocked, it's not strong scene at all. Also, protagonist's penis penetration of bad guy's eye hole seemed inappropriate in tone, too caricatured. Must also say that I'm not happy with, so to say, hollywoodisation of film's style - I think that story needed more raw approach although I appreciate technical-designers skill of director, DP and rest of the crew.Finally, film is disturbing, but for experienced and open minded people not too much. I even find that theme of minor's sexuality deserved much more elaborations than has got here, character of provocative puberty girl deserved much more space.All in all, ""A Serbian Film"" is very solid movie, for today's Western cultural standards very bold in best way, and hope that its authors will soon get chance for new project.",A Serbian Film
184,eebmtl,Most disturbing film ever,4,17 July 2010,"What can I say.....I've seen them all and this movie is the most disturbing film I have ever watched.Saw it last night at the Fantasia film festival in Montreal, the director Srdjan Spasojevic was there for a post screening Q & A, but first Mitch Davis (head of Fantasia) forewarned those in attendance that it was a truly disturbing film and there had been incidents at other screenings where people had become ill, not difficult to believe.Srdjan Spasojevic then came out and said: ""every generation of the past 100 years in my country has lived through war and my film is to be viewed as a metaphor of what this has done to the country and it's people and remember it's only a movie"".My feeling is that either the director hates his country or the collective psyche of the Serbs is disturbed to a degree that few could comprehend.Now my review: As a metaphor this film works well, the message of a society where the effects wrought by unspeakable acts, atrocities, betrayal, complete disregard for human life and the subsequent permanent damage, is hammered home successfully; the survivors may be no better off than those who lost their lives.However the images we are forced to endure to get this message; graphically displayed rape/snuff/pedophilia/incest/torture porn, are so over the top that I am not convinced that the director's message will be successfully relayed to the world outside Serbia.I am somewhat surprised that this film can be screened as is in North America, trust me it won't play in the bible belt in the USA.The acting was alright, the soundtrack overbearing at times, the most extreme scenes do not need any help from the score to heighten the effect of what we are seeing on screen.It's difficult to comment on the direction as the viewing experience is somewhat overwhelming, but it did seem uneven and heavy handed at times.Not for the squeamish, don't go with your girlfriend, believe me when I say regardless of all the other times when hype was used to build up a film and when you finally view it you are underwhelmed by how mild the shock and controversy, etc. actually turns out to be, this will not be the case if you see this movie.Only four out of ten because the goal of conveying the damage Serbian society is living with is lost as your sensibilities are overwhelmed by the imagery and extreme situations on screen.WOW, an experience I will not soon forget!",A Serbian Film
185,The_Great_Silence,Torture porn with a message,8,8 December 2010,"A Serbian Film is by far the most disturbing film I have ever seen. Don't write it off though. Between the hardcore sex and brutal violence there are political and social messages being sent. You may have a hard time watching the film, but that's exactly the point writers Aleksandar Radivojevic and Srdjan Spasojevic were trying to make.Living in Serbia their whole lives they have been constantly oppressed by their government. As their anger grew they channeled it into the script for A Serbian Film and turned the metaphor of people getting screwed by their government into something extremely literal.The main characters alone provide much insight into the film. A retired porn star (Milos), with a loving family he is trying to support, is hired by a maverick porn director (Vukmir), who considers himself a visionary artist and also happens to work for the government. When filming starts Milos realizes that the director might be a tad bit off his rocker. But it's not until he decides to quit that things really take a turn for the worse. Together these characters make a disgustingly hilarious mix that keeps you stuck to the screen even when it's almost too disturbing to watch.The thing that sets A Serbian Film apart from other torture porn films, besides the political message, is how great it looks. The films mise en scène is what truly raises the bar from other films in its genre. The content in A Serbian Film is not just shoved in your face, as it is in films such as Hostel and Saw, but beautifully presented in such a manner that it would feel worse to close your eyes than it would to just suck it up and watch.All in all, A Serbian Film is a torture porn film, but it's a torture porn film with a message that many politically correct films can't make.",A Serbian Film

The look of the thing is great. Good angles, great lighting, all that. A technically sound film. Damn near GORGEOUS in places.From a gore perspective, it's honestly not all that gory. There are a bunch of films that one- up this one HANDILY from a pure gore perspective. That's not to say that it ISN'T gory...it is, particularly towards the end.

And I'm not blaming the actors. I'm just saying that the writer/director Aleksandar Radivojevic should be in a mental institution. This guy only made 2 movies (well, 3...but the other one was produced by Luc Besson, so he couldn't ""move freely"" in that one. Thank God): this sickening piece of crap...and another one about a guy that gets hired to film A SNUFF FILM. See the resemblance? It's obvious that Radivojevic has a ""snuff fetish"".

Of course I avoided the spoiler reviews as I don't like to know much about a film before I've watch it, all I knew that it was apparently 'disturbing'. Don't get me wrong, there were moments when I was watching it and thought 'what the f*ck am I watching?'. When it comes to the idea of it being disturbing, think only a few scene's will leave a 5 minute lasting effect. Of course, it depends on the person and how easily shocked they can be. ***SPOILERS***When he cut her head off while having sex with her and when the family scene happened near the end, those two moments in the film seemed to add to the shock value of the film. The rest seemed like torture porn. The part with the baby being born and then raped, was probably the only bit that made me say to myself 'oh bloody hell!', that part did well to add shock value. ***END SPOILERS**So did I find this disturbing? Think it's up there with a few other films which i've given my own title 'what did I just watch?'. Did it make me feel dirty watching it? No, because it's a film and films are suppose to at times, delve into challenging subjects that can shock people that these kind of acts can take place in the real world at the hidden end of society. In that sense, I think the film achieved what it wanted to achieve.'Why did I rate it 6 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10?' Simple really. 10 out of 10 ratings for me, are for the best films ever made. This film is not one of those, it's average. Average films for me, are on the 5-7 scale. I was debating on the 6 rating instead of 7 but think a 6 rating is fair. The acting was OK, the story was OK, script was OK. Everything was on par with a 6. 'Would I recommend this film?' Yes but only to those who do not get all squeamish over a minor thing. Watch it and let it take you where it' trying to go. It's worth at least a one time watch, could you re-watch it over and over?

189,diveinthedark-89834,Double Standards Surrounding Extreme Violence ; This Film Ain't As Bad As They Say !,7,26 April 2016,"You've probably heard lots of bias statements surrounding Serbian Film ; extreme violence and exploitation, no plot to justify, trying to offend to the max, etc. In reality, this film has been targeted by certain authorities and groups as being an unjustified, immoral, and plain disgusting piece of creativity that should be avoided at all costs. But all the negative reviews and feedback seem quite a double standard when put into perspective within the film industry. So why do people resent Serbian film ? :- Extreme graphic violence? Is this really anything new in the modern age ? Likewise is it a problem? - Lack of plot? Sure, I too think the Serbian government metaphor is ridiculous and barely obvious. BUT, lets not forget this sort of porn is made in real life and films like this raise social awareness. - Child Rape ? Sure, I'm British and in that respect we're the most guilty nation on the planet, what with the scandal surrounding some of our famous celebrities and any uneasiness I may have felt when 1st seeing this film may be a national cultural issue ! I think it's easy to use child-rape as a scapegoat ; sure, perhaps it is THE most unforgivable evil act imaginable, but that doesn't mean to say it's immoral to portray it theatrically whilst other extreme acts of violence should be considered good by comparison and unashamedly theatrically portrayed to an infinite degree.To be honest, other 'Torture Porn' films are distinctly more controversial. 'The 120 Days Of Sodom' is far more questionable. I mean, a whole film about child rape and faeces-eating with no actual story line or consequence whatsoever; I rest my case. What about French film 'B***e-Moi'? A rape scene with real sex. (acted by porn stars, obviously!) Even mainstream, Hollywood-type films like 'A Time to Kill' evolve around child rape/murder. Sure, the crime of child abuse wasn't absolutely necessary to the story, but it does go on in society, so why not portray it, as something real?I understand 'Serbian Film' did perhaps touch SOME new ground and that certain types of scenes will come across as disturbing simply because they haven't been seen before ; give it a decade or 2, and they'll seem second nature, mild-by-comparison even !

Well unless you think 'in Serbia everyone gets raped' is a deep political message then you'll likely disagree. I think it likely the makers are claiming this because if they admitted it's a silly exploitation movie- which it is- no one would find the content acceptable. I don't think it should be cut or banned though, because that just risks turning it into a legend.I watched this film because it was the day my father died and I wanted something to indulge my bad mood- and it even failed at that- I wouldn't have touched it otherwise, and I would strongly advise you to avoid it. Can't stop you of course, but it's your funeral.",A Serbian Film

194,cjdgod7,Exploitation For Exploitation Sake? Or A Truly Disturbing Film To Be Avoided?,4,10 January 2020,"Firstly it is disturbing! And gross, vile, horrible and sadistic.
I don't agree with banning films but how this hasn't been banned outright is beyond me when you consider The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre didn't get certified releases until after 2000!
It is basically a  with as many vile scenes the director could think of tacked on.
But....
It doesn't come close to the sheer intensity of Martyrs (obviously the original French version).
A Serbian Film is just that, a film, and you know it is.
But Martyrs stuck in my mind for years after seeing it and not in a good way where as A Serbian Film has the feel of one of the video nasties. You know it's a film and it becomes more like a 'I'll watch it to say I've seen it'.
Whereas Martyrs is a film you don't really want to talk about.
Be careful though, I'm not saying A Serbian Film won't disturb when watching and it's a really well made film. It's brutal and has scenes I could have easily went my life without seeing.
But it isn't the most disturbing film ever made, it comes in second to Martyrs!",A Serbian Film

Now after the movie I feel full of prospect for this life because this film introduced such a dark and extreme incident. OK, if you look at this film from an ethical point of view, you may find it disturbing, but if you look at it as art, art of film, of pornography, I think it's a rare piece of work worth noticing. The plot is unpredictable and the topics are challenging. Let's all be very honest and think about how porn influence us and how we consume porn. This movie offer a very interesting analysis on how people enjoy porn and if any, does it harm people and how. I find it disturbing but I have to admit it is satisfying to watch such a film. There is undeniably beauty in the sick and in the grotesque. It's like a blow in your nose when you get tired of that Hollywood formula and those European indie arty films.

The point; that you are going to be subjected to the most horrifying of all human abuses in history. The film delves into this brutal and dark territory as a story about a retired adult film star who is running out of money to support his family. He is offered a job to do one last ""project"" by a mysterious cameraman and his posse; who may or may not be connected to other things politically. Once he begins on this project he soon realizes the devastating results it is leaving behind. Enmeshed with elements of body horror, psychological thriller, and jet black comedy it is an assault on all senses and a complete mind bender. If you can work past the indescribably gruesome content within the film; you should be able to see it for its shining merits as well.",A Serbian Film
198,j_glentzes,Pushes the envelope.,7,10 August 2018,"First of all most people reviewing this film are hypocrites. Didn't you know what you were about to watch ? Are you living somewhere where the internet doesn't exist ? This is an infamous movie that people that couldn't stomach it shouldn't attempt to watch it and then when it surfaced on YouTube it had millions of views and hundreds of thousands of comments, most of them warning us ....not to watch it but all of you did anyway !Other than that the film has its successes and its failures. Its biggest failure is actually the ""look how extreme I am"" attitude which leads to some laughable scenes. For example the baby scene might seem 
Ike the most horrifying scene ever put on film , when reading about it, but on the screen it comes off as completely fake, stupid and uneccecary. The villains are all cartoony looking and cliche and that takes away from the shock factor, it would have been better if they looked like regular people. The sex scenes are also laughable. Had the film been more suggestive than in your face , would have made it far more effective On the other hand the film has a great leading actor that gives it proper weight. Most of these extreme films have terrible actors that take you away from the story, this isn't the case here. The main actor gives a fantastic performance that really makes you sympathize him and feel sorry about him. His performance is daring and extreme. The last few 20 minutes are really difficult to stomach and are the ones that actually give this film its notoriety. Even so the tragic ending is being nullified by the villains, that come to continue their ungodly ""job"", being so stupid looking like comic book villains. Had the film ended with the death of the family would have made it much sadder and effective.The film doesn't hold a candle to proper extreme classics like cannibal holocaust, salo e.t.c but it is head and shoulders above what passes off for extreme cinema these days (with terrible films like human centipede, American guinea pig e.t.c) since it is professionally directed and acted. It's not for the faint of heart , though people (that have actually watched it)should stop preaching about how bad the people that are ....watching it are.",A Serbian Film

Won't say more, but just when I thought I'd gotten what the hype was all about it pushed the envelope just a little bit further!

200,LANGUISHMAN,"An empty film with a theme, nothing more.",2,20 November 2019,"When looking at film, I usually try to make it a little bit about everything, storytelling, technicality, performance, music etc. What makes every film special the most is their story. Films with a great story can usually make me enjoy it more than the technical aspects. So, when I watched 'A Serbian Film', I could not understand anything about it. I'm not intending to watch it a second, since, let's be honest here, its realistic graphics and vile in every way.Honestly, I don't mind the violent nature of it all. I actually 'enjoy' certain movies that use special graphic scenes to their advance the plot or a narrative or a theme. Take for example like 'Salo', a film I enjoy that I rated it 7/10. It was a film good on the technical aspects and everything among the like. It was clear about its message anti-authoritarianism, and the film goes out to explicitly tell you this. And I like the fact that it acknowledges its violent tendency and so forth. With 'A Serbian Film', I could not say the same thing. I don't enjoy it but I can see why there are qualities to like about it. It has a theme that explores the human emotion like sex, killing and obsession of art. These themes are explored throughout the film very explicitly up to the point where it becomes absolutely insane to the eyes, which is unabashedly honest and truthful. What makes it terrible however is its story.I don't get it, I don't like it. It does not add anything onto the film. When I look up what the director's vision was, all he can say that he just 'want to say something', but this so-called 'something' is explored in such a way that it becomes more like a futile thing rather than an actual experience. If this film was able to make itself more about characters rather than the themes than this film would be rated higher. In Salo, you don't need to care about characters, it was all about themes. But with this, you can only see the themes and sex and everything, without a proper reason for its existence (perhaps with the main character but even then, his emotions are completely worthless because he was drugged). Also, the fact that Salo did it 40 years ago makes it impressive that it tries to move cinema in another direction, whereas 'A Serbian Film' just does it now because it just wants to.In conclusion, watch this if you want to see some horrific imagery or getting a hypnotic visual that would leave you uncanny for the next 15 minutes. Otherwise, you shouldn't watch it. It might not be so great with friends though.",A Serbian Film

So I don't recommend it.",A Serbian Film
202,cobrasixtysix,A breakthrough? or just plain broken?,7,19 November 2011,"Where do I start with a film like this? I'm a prolific movie watcher and I love horror films, so this was a natural progression of interest for me. Of course, being banned in some countries was no limitation (an attraction for some) if you know where to look. I found myself saying, ""It's banned, so what, heaps of good films get banned, I mean, how bad could it be?"" So I skimmed a few IMDb reviews to see what the Kafuffle was. The opinion was extremely Polemic, everything from 0 to 10, how could this be? Undaunted, I forged ahead and acquired a copy. I decided to view it unseen with a group of my friends who were usually quite receptive to horror. We had seen many titles together including ""The Human Centipede I and II without too much commotion. There is a scene about halfway through (you'll know the one) that caused half the audience to vacate the room in disgust and the other half to wriggle in their chairs in disbelief of what they'd just seen. I mean, the concept is really that bad.really! But I must digress; The film actually has a real sense of quality about it, the directing, art, lighting, acting, sets, score, it's all there. This was no cheap money-grab; you're forced to take it seriously. This was going to be a very grim and undiplomatic depiction of the world of (dark) porn. Although its ""pièce de résistance"" the films quality is also why it is ""so horrific"". That reason is ""believability!"" As a viewer, you immerse yourself into the film, finding you can easily identify and relate with Milos (the protagonist) his family, their background and social and economic issues. Drawn by an irresistible offer to make one last ""big budget ""adult film and then retire, Milos consults with his wife. She agrees that it will be worth it and they promptly proceed. However things turn dark and Milos becomes concerned when his questions about the film and his role in it, are met with indifference or avoidance. As the scenes unfold there is a real sense of dread. Many scenes have teasing inferences of visual taboos and moral impasse that are fleetingly placed in Milos' view only to disappear just as quickly, much to the relief of Milos and audience alike. This approach persists throughout the film, keeping the audience on the edge. It seems to be saying, ""How shocked would you be if we proceeded down this track""? but, at the last second, closing that door to let you recover from the jolt that just belted you. This tactic continues until Milos starts to realise that things are getting way out of hand. As the movie progresses you are totally drawn in, you get a real feeling that ""you are Milos"" and you are subjected to the entire range of dilemma he faces. Milos' world becomes a truly terrible place, inhabited by truly cruel, sociopathic and evil people. At many points during the film, the reality lines get very blurred, it's difficult to tell if what Milos is experiencing is real, dreamt, drugged or stupor. In the end, this film is all about the destructive impossible nature of man and its consequences. This is probably the toughest film I have ever reviewed, the subject matter is almost too ""Messed Up"" to describe and violates almost every human emotion and value. In spite of its ghastly, horrific, amoral and socially unacceptable message, this film stands nonetheless, as a remarkable achievement in cinematography. A film I will remember for a very long time, not because it is a cinematic and meritorious masterpiece, which it arguably is, but for depicting a world so diabolical, chaotic, and disgustingly foul, that words so far have failed to describe. I would definitely not recommend this film to almost anyone. Quite possibly the most Polemic film ever made ""Beware, You Have Been Warned""",A Serbian Film

I expected a nice apology by Milos and returning to normal family life. But suddenly... What was his son's sin? 7-Yes!

Especially if you keep in mind what Srdjan Spasojevic is trying to say. This is not so much about the porn industry and it has nothing to do with the 'hostel' movies. The metaphor is all about the corruption and violation by authorities and foreign investments in Serbia; from the Balkan wars to the greed and political corruption that followed. The dates they are using in the film are a good clue to start putting the pieces together.Now, as for the film, I wont lie. It is unlike anything I had ever seen. It is sick in so many levels and brutal as hell. Especially towards the end, everybody in the room were looking at each other not being able to digest the most vulgar, depraved scenes we had ever seen. It makes movies like 'Nekromantic' or the 'Canibal holocaust' look like 'Finding Nemo'.

I read the description  before I watched it and had to muster up some guts to view it but it  wasn't bad at all! Sure, the pedophilia is immoral and disgusting but  if you're looking for a gory, gut-wrenching film then this is not it!  Even the Human Centipede 2 and The Cannibal Holocaust are far worse  films. The hype over this film is seriously for nothing. It's quite  comical how some people are acting all cool as if they've seen the most  badass, gory film ever. This is nothing! Merely a cheap porno with a  bit of violence here and there. It's actually turns funny instead of  horrific in some aspects. Choking a woman to death on a blowjob after  having all her teeth pulled out.. really? Don't waste your time on this  film at all. Over an hour into the film, you'll be bored. Near the end,  you'll be disappointed. But the ending dialogue is quite disturbing. Oh  the main scene that even made me a tiny bit hesitant to watch was the  scene where he sticks his d*** into the man's eye socket.

However being a student of film, you have to taste everything on the menu as it where, that way you can see whats good and what is bad.Now, this film is easily the most powerful and controversial film I have ever seen and in my opinion it could have been a real eye opener however, and it is a big however, it fails miserably to garner any credibility with its stomach churning scenes of rape and torture. I read a review on this very site stating that Eli Roth could learn a thing or two and that this was much more credible than the torture porn rubbish he has been making.Its not, to me this belongs on the same putrid pointless level that Hostel and the latter Saw film ooze along. The power of cinema is that it merely has to suggest the idea to us and leave it to fester over time, this causes us to think on the idea and let it evolve inside us.This idea is completely lost in this film as it in no uncertain terms aims to bring our breakfasts out from within with scene after scene of horrific rape, child abuse and in one case an unspeakable act involving a new born baby.I am in no way saying that these films should not be made, indeed I consider myself something of a champion of freedom of film making and speech. However, they do have to be done properly, we don't need to see a baby being born close up, we merely need good actors to react to whats happening.This is the kind of putrid tosh that is ruining extreme film making for those credible film makers that have a story to tell and the talent to do it. This is something out to shock, nothing more, to be the most controversial film ever... with no regard for artistic merit or storytelling.If there was a point to this film I would champion it as I have done with countless other XXX rated films.

Not since Cannibal Holocaust have I seen a film so conspiratorially hailed as supreme, so frantic shared through secret channels hidden from the public. I'm not sure Srpski film is anywhere near as philosophically deep as the filmmakers would have us believe. But regardless of why and how it was made, it's possibly more of a pure Anti-war-satire than anything else out there.Mad props to the whole crew: for a powerful flashback of 90s-traumas hailed down upon the Balkans like meteor showers; and for giving the middle finger to self-appointed social watchdogs around the globe. Director Spasojević says, Srpski film ""combats fascism of political correctness"". Mission accomplished! Sorry haters, you can ban films but you can't block truth! 11/10.

That's about the extent of the positive attributes of this movie.The biggest issue I have with this film on a personal level is its insistence that it's an art film which is trying to say something about the media, or the Serbian government, or the porn industry (pick your explanation honestly, I've heard all three cited at the True Meaning) when in actuality, it's a way for men to masturbate to snuff porn without actually having to look up the gore themselves. There is no coherent political or moral message and even of there was, it's so muddled in the poorly executed shock sequences that it's irrelevant. Saw had a more coherent message and by the last movie I couldn't even keep up with what year it was and who was still alive.On a technical level the movie's biggest issue is simply that it's boring. You'd think that as a person who is able to be entertained by flipping through high school health textbooks to look at pictures of burn victims, I could at least be entertained by the torture porn aspect but frankly there's only so much played out gore with primarily poor effects I can watch before it becomes mind numbing. And yes, I have seen the director's cut.So, basically, go watch 120 Days of Sodom. Or I Spit On Your Grave. Or Cannibal Holocaust. Or hell, just go watch the Human Centipede franchise if you like the gore. At least the creator of Centipede was honest in his desire to make his asshole-to-mouth movie dreams come true.

Not for the squeamish mind, but that can't possibly be held against it. If you look at any synopsis of 'A Serbian Film' it's clear what type of film this will be and that is a completely original one. Comparisons to 'Hostel' are stale. Moreover, the violence and snuff porn on display is completely integral to this film, would anyone review this film otherwise? It perhaps doesn't live up to the promise of it's rather arrogant title, however, there is a feeling that there is an actual purpose to 'A Serbian Film'.

224,louisebaker-05816,I Didn't Hate It...,6,13 November 2021,"I believe my opinions about this are going to be seen as wretched, hard to digest, and controversial by the audience who hates it for the simple fact that I did not hate it. I don't particularly like it, but I don't hate it. And I watched the uncut version.A Serbian Film is a metaphor for corrupt politics and its intent was to be extreme. It is presented as very literal but its meaning is not. It's hard to think of it as anything but literal while watching the film, but it was reassuring to know the purpose it served and, well, it definitely got its point across.Is the movie sick? 100%. It's like sitting through pure trauma and this is one movie I REFUSE to recommend because of its content. I mostly always say, ""If you want to watch blah blah blah, then you might like this film!"" in my reviews, but nope. Not with this one.Some of the film was poorly executed and some of it was well executed. Was this movie scary? I'd say so. It's scary, it's disgusting, it's vile, it's horrific, it's depressing. Therefore, it is effective. But I don't think it's a horrible film. People say it went too far. Did it? Yes. Enough to be censored? Yes. (And I'm not really for censoring.) Did I watch the uncensored version and lose faith in humanity? Yes. But that's the point. Apparently one of the writers and the director of the film, Srdjan Spasojevic, thinks it didn't go far enough. (Insert one of the awkward smiley face emojis.) I don't even know how to react to that.The cinematography wasn't anything special, like most of the film, the acting was solid all around, the plot was just messed up, and the last act was soul crushing. I don't remember there being much music in it, but the music at the beginning was memorable. It's about as disturbing as most people say it is. It's worthy of being on top ten most disturbing films lists.Many people say it's a good film without the extreme stuff, but what does that leave you with? Probably like 10-20 minutes of the movie.Ultimately, A Serbian Film doesn't stand out because of the filmmaking, but because it's relentless and sick. It's not a bad movie especially knowing the meaning behind it and it's just all around effective. I guess the reasons I sort of like it a little bit can all be explained by saying that it's effective.",A Serbian Film

This is not a film to enjoy and i don't understand why people are rating this film so highly. There are many scenes i wished i have never seen, one involving the newborn baby scene, which is just sick and depraved, and one involving the rape of a 6-7 year old boy by his father. How anyone can think of filming anything like that is not right in the head in my opinion.

229,Misxkonije_Mali,If in doubt - Don't Watch !!!,10,17 April 2012,"This movie did cause quite a stir when it got released. I must admit that it did take a long while since I got to watch it, that is, just a few hours ago, which is a bit strange since i do live, have a family, and work, here, in Belgrade, Serbia.It will tell something that this is my first post here, and my thoughts haven't precipitated enough, so you can expect some strong language now, but, I guess, since you're here already, you'll get used to it.First: This is not a porn movie although you'll see some nudity. This is not a snuff movie, although you'll see death. Not a crime flick, not a horror although you will probably have trouble sleeping through the next night. I think you'll have trouble with your sleep exactly because this is a life movie.Second: This is a good movie, at least i think so. Did I love it? No, I hate it. Or more accurately I do not hate the movie, I hate the truth in it. It could be compared to chili beans, or a smelly cheese, people will avoid you for the rest of the day, and you'll still have it. This is a movie with a lot of calories in it, and it will take time to digest.Third: And this is the thing where probably most readers won't agree, THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT SEX! I really don't think it has anything to do with it, but if you still get a wood while watching, go see a shrink. I truly do believe that the sex and shock flick here is just a cover to deliver a story which just might be much closer to all of us regardless of where we live. And that is a true horror of it.This movie has many levels, more stories you can follow. -The story of a father and a husband that goes through a length to provide for his family, damaging it irreparably in the process, thus defeating the purpose, is just one thread of it. However ridiculous it seems, he earns his wage quite honestly. -The story of a wife that lives with it. (it can get a bit wobbly here but it'll pass) -The story of a failed child psychiatrist/director, with misplaced ambitions, the one that provides the actual service... -The brother/policeman, an opportunist, but you'll see it for yourself. Was his job ever (or a job of any government agency for that matter) to protect you, or did he immediately realize that he is there just to find a way to suck you dry while providing the ""service"", and get a little fu*k while he can... -The God following porn mom with a horror story... -Last but not the least, stories of all the middle people here. Without them all of this simply would not work. And that is where I, and probably many of you do come in.Do not think I'm one of the saints here. I'm just saying that most (and I mean most by far) of us knowingly or not, are included in this (or something equally alike). I feel bad though, for watching this without paying, so I'll buy a legal copy as soon as I find it just to support the crew.I am not saying this in order to make anybody feel bad, nor to cause any level of shame or remorse higher than what you already feel, that would be counterproductive.The point is that the world can be a much better place to be in and this movie clearly shows it. We are just too used to look the other way while crawling our lives by.If you still return to the actual movie that we've begun with...At the end as the main characters can not cope with the things they've done, although being the least guilty of it. Just the next middle someone, only without any moral questioning, will use their lives for his own purposes.And the story continues.If you are in that productive age that this movie is made for, what this movie does to you is that it reminds you of the pain in your behind that you've come to ignore. This pain that all of you working people know too well, but have learned to live with. Characteristic of a big meaty thing shoved up the depth of your intestines. And as most of us, you just chose not to wiggle too much and relax, so it would hurt less.You'll laugh to this joke because you'll find yourself in it too.Well, do yourself, and all of us a favour.Bite your belt, tongue or whatever you do have...and do wiggle...They'll probably not stop it for a long time... But at least they might start using lubricants.Good luck.P.S. And do think a bit. It just might be that them is actually you. If you're any kind of government employee, are you making any lives easier? Any middle people? Where does your wage come from? Are you sure you've earned it? Really? P.S.S. Do not make a mistake and apply this to my country only. More or less we're globally in various flavours of this same slick material and i've been around enough to see it. Btw my name is Milo too.

230,nikkiflinn,Darkest moment,7,14 October 2014,"There are movies you can watch over and over again until your eyes bleed and you still want to watch them one more time. There are movies you never care to see. There are movies that you regret watching.And then there's movies like A Serbian Film.Those are the kind of movies that you watch and you think to yourself, why am I still watching? It's not that the film is scary and it's not that there's so much action going on that you just haven't had a chance to put it away. It's the opposite in fact. This movie starts out slow but much like a good horror film, you get the sense that something isn't right very quickly.That's how it was for me at any rate. For about three months now, I've been lurking on various movie sites, this one in particular, gearing up for my Halloween Marathon. I decided to do things a bit differently this year and focus more on films that are disturbing rather than plain scary. I won't be reviewing all of them but this one was exceptional and demanded a review in a timely fashion.If you've seen the film, you know that I have to talk about that ending. If you haven't, skip the rest of this review.I'll be honest: I suspected the moment they started that flashback in the final 'bedroom'. The camera panned around to reveal two hidden bodies, only the legs visible and it was obvious that one was a kid and the other an adult. I suspected and the whole time, until the big reveal, I was like, no. Don't do it.And they did. I don't cringe in movies but I did for that. And that wasn't even the worst part. The brutal rape of his own wife and child (At his own hands and his brother's, no less) was actually not the worst part for me. Nor was it the gruesome revenge sequence. It was later, after Milos returned home and found his wife and kid in the basement, both alive, both semi-catatonic. For me the worst part was that moment when Milos had the gun in his hand and Maria put her hand over his because it said everything. This family was broken and in all fairness, that was the ONLY acceptable ending for them. They would never be whole again and the only way to live with that was to not.All in all, a good film but not one I'm going to be watching again any time soon.",A Serbian Film

This film contains pedophilia, necrophilia...Okay, this film is similar to Hostel: they abduct people and torture them just for pleasure. Here, in Srpski Film, they do what they do for love of ""Art"". I personally watched this film because i watched Human Centiped 1 and 2 last 2 weeks . You can't assume, for sure, this film or this kind of film if you've never watched any horror films before, and, believe me, you have to see strong horror films before seeing this one. The actors are extremely good, they make you believe at what you're seeing at the screen and the way the film is directed is way too much well done. If you're not chocked, you're not human ! You only need to watch 2 minutes to be chocked, and just a little more than one hour to be mentally broken . Newborn porn. Can you believe that ? They made this film because they felt they had to express themselves, express their anger of being oppressed by their government who took fifteen years of their life . I saw that in a written-interview on the best French Cinema Website named ""Allociné"". They said they had to put a newborn porn scene to show to people that we are maltreated during our entire life.

234,brianaburton,Feels Like a Parody,4,18 August 2017,"I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be ""one of the most disturbing movies ever made"", but instead I was left feeling very underwhelmed and quite surprised that people truly found this movie ""shocking"".From a general standpoint sure the movie technically qualifies as something disturbing, but the movie almost felt like a parody of a horror movie rather than an actual horror film. The scenes in the film that would classify as disturbing or scary were laughably over acted and way too over-dramatic. I'm not sure if that is what the director was trying to go for or if he honestly thought what he was doing looked realistic. It's truly hard to tell if this movie is a joke or not and that's the main issue with the film.As for the movie being ""messed up"" it sure is, but not in a realistic sense. If you're a fan of martyrs (2008) or films that classify under new french extremity than this movie might give you a good laugh. The only part in this movie that I honestly felt the need to look away from was the ""newborn porn"" scene, but for the rest of the film it was very obvious that what was occurring was fake due to the lack of good acting skills. This movie is not afraid to show you heavy nudity and is essentially soft-core porn, but the film did not show a lot of the gore and violence, it is implied, but a lot of it is not shown. In addition, the story to this film is very much lacking and uninteresting. I really doubt anyone who has watched this film or wants to watch this film is interesting in the plot and for good reason. The characters in the movie are very 2-dimensional and boring.In conclusion, A Serbian Film is not a very good movie. If you are a fan of gore and ""messed up"" movies then you may get a kick out of this, but it really isn't anything worth watching.Rating 4.8/10Like messed up movies?: Watch it.Like well made movies?: Don't watch it.",A Serbian Film

240,phunkysquirrel-1,Eastern European Tourism Fail,8,14 March 2011,"No need to go over the synopsis, simply this movie is a nihilistic entrance into many similar Hollywood scare movies about Eastern Europe. We had Hostal and then Severance, and in-between Them, all of which were great in their own right. Didn't do much for eastern European tourism, other than Poland which rose 10% in 2010. I was reminded in parts that this movie is kinda gangster and gritty like Layer Cake, but was more gory than Layer Cake was clever with a twist on the bad guys then final ending of Layer Cake vs. this movie.Serbian Movie moves in a similar vein and theme of extreme sexual violence to Visitor Q. The difference is that Visitor Q, being very extreme actually had a deep ethical point to make i.e: redemption and family values. Perhaps the point of this movie was all about power and abuse within the movie industry and it's effects on the actors of all ages. Still, it's not really clear across culture what the movie was saying. This is the movie's downfall. In terms of a linear Hollywood plot movie, it goes a WHOLE lot further and deeper than all films released on the cinema in 2011 to date.Sure Visitor Q was an extreme parody. Serbian Movie on the other hand was trying to say something, but hammered home a point about life being pain and everyone a victim. However this was scripted too heavily in one scene to be considered a point an indie movie was trying to make. Hollywood just uses voice-overs as the major going populous is unable to fathom a movie's depths!This movie is extreme, violent and nasty. If you've seen Oldboy there's many clever parts in the script or direction to make you go back time and time again. This movie fails on this fundamental point. Fight Club was nihilisticI would say on the whole it's well directed and the main protagonist, one almost feels for. His family and what happens to them, one is less distressed about as there's no connection made to with them to the viewer. For this reason, the movie comes across as harsh. The vengeance or anger element I thought, so what. There was nothing tying me to really feel for the characters.All in all, it deserves about an 8 in terms of its weight and flow as a heavy gangster movie. It falls short of explaining WHY it's so gritty and why use such visual imagery when it fails to convey a deeper point.",A Serbian Film

It's a nasty film with something to say. It's got something to say about money, about art, about family and about life in the ""not-as- rich"" parts of the ""civilized"" world. I think this movie is a part of a cleansing. A cry to the world; don't let sick stuff happen. It might just be me, but I thought I could see all that through out the film.It is a very well made movie. The acting is solid to the end. The camera-work is just superb. Lighting, sets and costumes are just delicious! It's got texture. A look of it's own. The gore effects are also unbelievably well made. That is why this film is so hard to watch.

242,victor-fraga,The cutting-edge of violence and porn,10,21 December 2010,"More repulsive than Pasolini's Salò, more uncomfortable than Gaspar Noë's Irreversible and more controversial than Ken Russell's The Devils. A Serbian Film is certainly one of the most powerful and creative representation of violence ever seen.This 2010 film is a acutely well-observed and intelligent study of the atrocities committed by the Serbian government, deftly symbolised by ultra-sadistic pornography. It is a commentary on a nation's alienation and the world's oblivion towards a culture of abuse. The sexuality of the characters in the film is utterly perverse and twisted, while pleasure is inexorably linked to pain.A Serbian Film starts out as a clichéd family drama of retired porn star Milos, who decides to make his last feature film – supposedly an art-porn flick - in order to make ends meet for his family. He is persuaded to sign a contract without knowing the film content, which turns out to be snuff movie containing murder, necrophilia, paedophilia and incest - all graphically detailed for the un-delight of the audiences. Gradually, the narrative breaks down into several layers, including memories, allegories and videotapes. There is no redemption in the end of the film. Instead, everyone around Milos becomes encapsulated in the snuff-art-porn horror – either as an accomplice or as a victim.Debuting Serbian director Srdan Spasojevic describes his porn-horror flick as ""a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government"".Differently from Hollywood thrillers and mainstream slashers, violence in A Serbian Film has a purpose: denouncing the recent history of a country and the convenient omission of its population. Serbia conducted two wars in less than 15 years and committed the large massacre in Europe since the 2nd World War. More than 8,000 civilians were killed in just a day by Serbian troops in Sebrenica in July 1995, an act more repugnant than all sequences in Saposevic's film combined. To this date, few have been convicted of war crimes, and most of the killers remain at large.Serbian twisted sexuality has been a subject of other films dealing with Serbian culture, including Marina Abramovic's Balkan Erotic Epic. But Spasojevic goes beyond sex and constructs the ultimate anti-erotic piece. A Serbian Film is so violently energetic that it is hardly impossible to watch – let alone derive any pleasure from it. A masterpiece of political and social denunciation.",A Serbian Film

I'm not trying to be funny about the themes used for the movie like horrendous newborn rape, paedophilia and violent sexual assault against women which are the most shocking crimes. I'm mocking the acting, props, make-up and direction which would make a school play look like a Hollywood blockbuster in comparison. Hard to be shocked about the newborn scene when the perp is holding up a cabbage patch doll prop. It's so bad it's almost a comedy with the acting talent of a 70's Swedish porn movie.

Oh yeah, it's actually got some laugh out loud moments also, but it never takes you away from that feeling of dread and utter disgust.As a previous review said, there are about 4 scenes that I will never forget in my life. I saw this about a week ago and every time I see the friends I saw it with the scenes come up in our conversations. There are things put on celluloid that I never, ever thought I would see in a cinema in America(or Europe for that matter).Go into this with extreme caution and a very open mind. I loved it.",A Serbian Film

249,Herpumpkin,"Gracious, gracious, gracious...",10,24 November 2010,"I love film! Love it! Since I was as young as memories will allow, I have been constantly immersed in the world of film. Most father and sons share camping trips, baseball game visits, or fishing ventures, but father/son time, for me, was the trip to our local video store. We would spend hours browsing each section. Curious, I would inspect each box representative, the avatar of the actual film (VHS at the time) being kept in reserve behind the counter, in utter fascination and admiration. Detailing each's art, each's still photograph, each's opinion of what could possible be in store for the viewer if chosen.I literally grew up on film.Now, 24 years in age, I find myself still an avid film viewer. Currently, my niche in cinema has been viewing the films that ""dare"" you to watch them. The types that have disclaimers a mile long, proclaiming with bold text how many countries they were banned in, and even hinting at the stir the film has caused or causes. So for the past three or four years I have been exposing myself, happily I may add, to the style of cinema that may bare such adjectives as raunchy, trashy, and even pornographic. Pushed by these adjectives to points where some viewers would even dare to disregard the levels or degrees of art.The concept of a film having such a profound effect on its viewers and inspiring extreme levels of emotion is a concept that will eternally fascinate me. That is the very essence of art, to conjure emotion; raw emotion. Despite what label we associate the emotion to, if a medium of art is implying feeling upon its viewers than that medium of art has succeeded, in my opinion of course.This is why I chose to award ""A Serbian Film"" with 10 stars. Because it is the bravery of such film crews, under the direction of such film directors, that allows our perception to trace the lines between what is art and what is not art (if there is such a concept).The nature of this film is INCREDIBLY SHOCKING, graphically depicted, flinching, yet beautifully unmerciful. To be honest, I did not believe I would have been moved by this film the way it has. Every time a new ""controversial"" film hits the news, it always seems to fail upon execution, regarding the hype that followed. ""A Serbian Film"" was the exception to that rule. I was completely unhinged by the content.However, within the fact of my discomfort resides my love for its boldness. After gushing over the horrendous details found within the film, I am grateful that everyone responsible in this film's production did what they did. They exercised the greatest liberty any artist can wish to achieve, expression. And not only the liberties of expression, but being able to share that expression with an audience. What we do with it is our art, our expression, a never ending cycle that is the further essence of art.So whether we love it or hate it, if that emotion is felt, this film has succeeded. Furthermore, if that emotion is voiced, this film has succeeded.I, personally, will be eternally grateful for this film's existence. Whether it be a political statement of injustice, a target for media controversy, or just a limit of how far art can push a viewer's emotions. Hats off to all the crew that was involved. I feel that this is a new benchmark for cinema. Positive or negative? Time will tell.",A Serbian Film

251,glynosxr,One of the latest masterpieces of extreme cinema!!A terrific allegory of our society!!!,10,11 May 2013,"A Serbian film is the Srdjan Spasojevic notorious directional debut of one of those movies that depicts violence as an inner crime of humanity.Like Cannibal Holocaust and Irreversible,this movie wants to make us feel uneasy and uncomfortable about violence because,in order to understand violence you must first feel it,that is the main motive of this film,to feel repulsive about violence.Also this movie,it appears to be an allegory of our modern society and how capitalism and money corrupts people and manipulate them in order to do things that doesn't want(there is a particular scene when Milos(main character)inserted into an abandoned orphanage and he has in his ear something like hearing aid,from this hearing aid he receives commands by the director in order to do things he doesn't want,in this scene it looks more like a puppet of government).Also,it seems that the police has something to do with the main plot which i think is also a message about how they are watching our movements.Furthermore,it is satire of other Serbian movies that's why this movie called A Serbian Film.However,the movie in his first steps of screening was misunderstood by the audience because it depicts graphic scenes of violence and mostly for the scene when a newborn baby raped by an unknown adult man(i must refer that is fake)which i think is also an allegory.Many called this a torture porn with pedophilia but in fact it supposed to depicts those subjects in picture to make us realize the evil face of pornographic movies and also to think the possibility that the so called ""newborn porn""is a disturbing reality that we all afraid.Advantages:A really well-made,well-written disturbing movie and with a great soundtrack.Also,the acting of Srdjan Todorovic as Milos and Sergej Trifunovic as Vukmir was perfect,the characters was well-written and with a background story.Disadvantages:Some really nasty scenes that are very hard to watch because of its sexual and violent content.Conclusion:A disturbing masterpiece with a great story,perfect acting,haunting score and characters with personality.",A Serbian Film
252,aleblok70,Ultra nasty social criticism,10,10 January 2012,"Srdjan Spasojevic's Serbian Film is very strange, as starts from its title, there could be a metaphoric meaning. The beginning (to the middle of the film) is without execs, but when you discover the true nature of this film, you won't be so glad.Film starts with porn scenes, and topics are already implied. Milosh is a retired porn star, but he has wife and kid as well. Plot includes his meeting with Vukmir, a psychotic person. He offers him an art porn for a large amount of money. It will be raveled that movie, a Serbian film directed by Vukmir, will be their worst nightmare with a lot of terrible scenes.As Spasojevic said, those horrible and disgusting scenes are meant to be a social critics of Serbian life, but wouldn't all that look much more suitable if it's done in comedy, drama, or some other, brighter style/genre?

I can't understand why any actor would agree to shoot the horrific scenes! If it is purely for the pay cheque, their moral compass is broken. There is no way I would allow my child to be in a film, his parents must be mental! I know the father/so rape scene wouldn't have used an actual child, but still. It's paedophilia.

254,MiloXC-HD,"I loved it, but I don't have a faint heart and I admire what Spasojevic has done and how effective this film is.",8,6 December 2012,"See the FULL review (over 4000 words) at: http://miloponsford.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/a-serbian-film-2010.htmlA Serbian Film is perhaps best-known for its notoriety and controversy rather than the film itself. Many say that this reaction and notoriety was the purpose of the film, but the idea is debatable. What you think of the film all comes down to personal opinion.I believe that even though the disturbingly-violent content is like no other modern splatter-film, the violence has been intended for a justified purpose.The sexual content of the film is on par with the violence in terms of controversy and extremity; in fact, most of the time, the sexual content is the violent content. The combination of the two varies from necrophilia and rape to sick-porno-sex whilst the victim is hacked to death. Brutal, right? Almost all the sexual nature in this film is extremely violent, and almost all the violence in this film is of a sexual nature. Spasojevic confidently argued that this content is intentional and he chose to represent the political message through pornography; ""The major metaphorical take concerning this film was to treat real life as pornographywe have brought ourselves to the point where we experience our lives as pure exploitation through which we are emotionally, psychologically and creatively raped by the incomprehensible, chaotic, unbelievably stupid and brutal forces of corrupt authority."" I believe that, yes, the content may be off-the-scale on both the violent-meter and the sex-o-meter but the film was intended to be controversial for justifiable reasons and wasn't made for an average horror-film fan.Spasojevic has been brave enough to take things to a new level and set a new boundary. Many others on the other hand believe he has gone way past the boundary and must never return, and we must never reach him.Elements of sadism and masochism are both explored in A Serbian Film; other films that have explored these include Takashi Miike's Audition, Ichi The Killer and Imprint, as well as numerous other highly controversial films such as Lars von Trier's Antichrist and Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò (The 120 Days Of Sodom). Few of these, however, have explored sadomasochism (a combination of the two). A Serbian Film uses sadomasochism to create a sense of patriarchy and empowerment over the females. This is what Spasojevic intended as he attempted to portray his idea that women are treated horribly in Serbia. A Serbian Film can be seen as hugely influenced by Japanese-director Takashi Miike; as explored by Louise Buckler in the article 'The films of Takashi Miike; An Exploration of Violence and Sadomasochism within his narratives'. Takashi Miike was influenced heavily by late Kabuki theatre and 'erotic-grotesque (eru-guro) films' and, more noticeably, the Japanese 'pink industry' which helped violence, sex and torture become a part of popular Japanese culture and art. Also in Miike's Audition the torture scene at the end is seen as art. This is similar in A Serbian Film where the extreme pornography (combined with torture and violence) is seen as art by Vukmir, the director. The film in which Vukmir wants to make could also be seen as a 'romantic porno film' (Roman porno); ""Roman porno films break down the barriers of distinction between the erotic and the violent, allowing violence and torture to become one with sexual practises"". Vukmir believes that violence and sex can be used together to produce art.Perhaps the main debate over A Serbian Film is the reasoning behind the violent and extreme sexual content throughout. Some argue that the extreme content was intended for Spasojevic's pleasure whilst some argue it was to show Serbia's corrupt law and politicians.The interpretation and reading of Spasojevic's reasoning is also very controversial; many audiences have an aberrant reading of Spasojevic's statement and just see the content as a representation of his sick interest in violence and pornography, whilst other audiences actually have a negotiated reading and think something along the lines of ""yeah, this film really does actually represent Srdjan Spasojevic's opinion on the law and government of Serbia! I agree and this isn't just an extreme gore flick; it is much more than that!"" You have to watch the film and sit back and think, ""What do I really believe?"" to have a personal judgement of the representations and exploitation of A Serbian Film. This is also one reason for A Serbian Film's notoriety; what Spasojevic said caused another big debate about the film's portrayal or Serbia and caused even more arguments and discussion.To conclude, it is fair to say that A Serbian Film is a highly controversial film and is easily near the top of the list of notorious horror films. It's hard to say something about this film and have an opinion without causing a debate, because so many different audiences had different reactions and the opinions you make are more personal; it's up to you what you think of think of this film. You're on your own. Srdjan Spasojevic may be telling the truth about why he chose to exploit and humiliate people in this film like he did and why he used so much extreme content, but that too is up to you to decide. Yes, this film has been cut by almost four minutes by the BBFC; yes, this film has been banned in numerous countries already; yes, this is a very extreme film that will put many audiences off, but it deserves to be seen. Spasojevic has achieved something that many modern horror directors, such as Eli Roth, have not: notoriety and high controversy. A Serbian Film is simply no snuff film, no poorly-made and badly-crafted. It is a masterpiece and has brilliant cinematography, acting and effects. It is one of the most controversial horror films of all time.Honestly, I loved it, but I don't have a faint heart and I admired what Spasojevic has done and how effective this film is. Go ahead, think I'm a psycho.",A Serbian Film

257,RachyLovesRattys,Most Disturbing Film Ever? Eh...,6,2 September 2013,"My friends and I had long awaited viewing A Serbian Film. The most disgusting movie ever, they said. You'll be troubled for weeks, they said. Well, while not denying that this movie was filmed and acted with a great amount of skill- I'm not disturbed. Like some others, I did find quite a few of the more graphic and violent scenes to come across in a very comical manner. My friends and I sat laughing for a good chunk of the movie. Also, I took the warning that the first half (perhaps a little more) of the film is used to get the viewer to pity Milos and feel bad for the position he's in in life- an average man (albeit ex porn star) with a family he's trying to support. The climactic scenes of violence were those types of moments where you are uncomfortable in your seat, but not grossed out enough to run away. I don't know- perhaps it was my young age foray into movies like Pink Flamingos (c'mon- that Bird is the Word scene!) that makes A Serbian Film seem so mild-mannered. Like another reviewer said, if it was real- obviously it would have been upsetting/troubling beyond all words. However, it's clearly just the work of a special effects team (a good one at that though!). I guess the reason I'm really butt-hurt about this movie is because the end was so damn predictable. From the first few moments of the film I KNEW how it'd end, which I rudely announced to my friends. At the end they asked, ""how the hell did you guess it ended that way?"" Well, to me, it felt like a big ""DUH"" within the first few minutes. I would have given this movie a 9/10 if it didn't make me feel that way. But despite any plot twists and turns, this movie was downright predictable and, while not disappointed, I'm not impressed either.P.S.

I have been meaning to write a review for this movie for a long time, because I wanted people to know that this is by far the best movie ever. The music is awesome and hardcore, they hold nothing back, they even have skull fu*king(in the original version, I heard they had to cut it out of the American NC-17 version)But I was surprised when I first watched this, because I thought it was going to be super disturbing by reading all these reviews. Turns out, people over hyped it. But the movie itself was excellent and way better than I expected. I watched it twice in a row on the first day and then I've seen it tons of times since. Definitely not disturbing after the first time you see it. The ""child rape"" scene uses a cabbage patch doll...so if that disturbs you, then I guess you are just delusional because it's not even close to being real, or looking real.All of the gore also look fake, so that's not disturbing either. But the movie itself is just so awesome. It's got everything in it...and the story line is great, the ending is even better...and the music, as I said before, is awesome. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes dark, extreme movies, and is not delusional. Delusional people shouldn't watch this, because they might be scarred, thinking it's real or something. It didn't give me any nightmares, I have no wish to ""unsee"" this, in fact I watch it a lot. It's my new favorite movie. I hope the director comes out with a part two, because this was very well made.The only other movie which compares to this one, is Visions of Suffering, but that movie has virtually no story...and honestly it's different.

Well, THAT didn't happen.But I didn't hate A Serbian FILM. I guess it just depends upon what you're looking for. Personally, I'm a huge horror and exploitation film fan -- everything from 50's sci-fi to Grindhouse classics to modern fare. So I was entertained by this movie. The story is halfway decent, the gore effects are not half bad, and the film itself is beautifully shot. Am I now scarred for life? Hardly. My wife watched this movie with me and she even thought it was kind of boring.Just to go over some specific scenes. The ""newborn porn"" sequence. The ""baby"" is just one step above the puppet baby from COMBAT SHOCK. It doesn't even look remotely real. The ""beheading"" sequence. Well, that one worked -- excellent effects. The ""woman with all of her teeth pulled"" scene. That's been done before. The ""family rape scene."" I guess that's only graphic if you've never seen the original I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE or IRREVERSIBLE.So in the end, this is a gory exploitation film. Nothing more. Nothing less. Did I hate it?

263,mikiec,A film within a film,7,18 October 2010,"This is a movie about the making of another movie, one of the porn genre. Despite all of the comments about the various scenes, there are no penetration scenes, very little real male genitalia (what is shown is prosthetics) and numerous women in various stages of nudity. As far as the gore scenes, the director leaves it to the viewer's imagination to assume the worst case scenario.IMHO, this film is an anti-porn film. It shows the darker side of the porn business and the lengths people will go to, to sate the desires which normal porn can not satisfy.It touches on all the stories you and I have heard about porn. People are in it for the money and/or drugs and the inability to break away from the porn industry and go straight. As the industry is always looking for fresh faces, the older porn actors/actresses must do things they would not normally do to earn some money.The porn industry continually looks to reinvent itself. If you have enough money and know the right people, there is probably nothing (outside of snuff films)that can't be made.

267,zekakhan,"Serbian ""Shock corridor""",9,12 August 2010,"I have read the comments previously added here and I share most of the conclusions and impressions. The reason I still wanted to write several lines is to add one or two facts surrounding this film, just to add to its background and complete the picture. I am from Belgrade and I have been waiting to see this one since the day I have heard it was being shot. Believe it or not, the co-maker of it, Aleksandar Radivojevic is the son of Serbian famous director Milos Radivojevic (Milos, ring the bell?! :) and became well known to the Serbian underground hard-core horror fans for the past ten years as the co-author of the show ""Shocking Corridor"", a Thursday late-night show containing the selection of mostly low production unbelievable horror/porn movie scenes which I had no idea where they were digging from! So, knowing that the film was to be made according to his screenplay, I was initially expecting the low budget production and some unknown actors. And then I have seen the casting. Dammit! Very popular and good Serbian actors and great looking actresses! Adding on the top of it, the music was made by unbelievable talented musician Djordje Miljenovic aka Wikluh Sky and that instantly placed this film on the top of my desired premiers list. Nevertheless, the film has practically never been played in Serbia and never will be. After only one premiere it has been practically banned. The excuse: no interests for it! Yeah ? OK. Is it really about being sick of the atmosphere of everyday living in Serbia? There is 7 million people in Serbia. While the rest of the free Europe was advancing toward the 21st century, Serbia has had two devastating wars and one bombing on the very opening of 2000 leaving its inhabitants with the hungry bodies and souls and the open wounds. Then the capitalism came in. Free market. What is free in the market of misery? Everything! People started selling out themselves in all kind of ways just to survive being easy targets to anyone with a fist full of Eur's (dollars are still not prevailing in Serbia). One could and still can ask for everything from the human being taking his or her money, smelling an easy target, and will never be directly rejectedthere is no real choice or free will for the average Serbian at all...So, since there is no time or space for one to depict such feeling of internal decay in a film, Radivojevic and Spasojevic have turned to Milos and his surroundings. Everyone can understand that. Let's not even start with ""war heroes"" and disturbed family relations during the time...It's all inside.Anyhow, I am still voting 9. Not excellentYap, it is one of the most explicit and shocking films ever made with the strong point, but still, it had an aura of abomination even before it was created so why censoring anything at all? Don't die in vain! He had to strip naked every scene and believe it or not, he did not! I know it. But ... that's when the wise directors and writers use their ""sequels"" :)",A Serbian Film

A retired porn star gets hooked back in by some very bad people. There are some seriously disturbing things that can make a lot of people physically ill so if you have a weak stomach, this movie is not for you. There's rape, murder, torture, and sometimes I think the director wishes he could get away with making a legit snuff film.

273,thorstenu2000,Extremely brutal film parable about the Serbian regime under Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s,9,2 March 2015,"A Serbian Film, ostensibly a repulsive horror movie or thriller, turns out, upon closer inspection, to be a political parable about reactionary, fascist political systems such as the Serbian one under Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s where, some 50 years after the end of WW2, prisoner and concentration camps, mass killings, mass rape and ethnic cleansing turned out to be a terrible reality again.ASF describes in highly symbolic form the dehumanization that takes place under such regimes and in times of ethnic conflict. The protagonist Milos and his family stand for the average citizen; the porn producer for political figures who promise their people simple and radical solutions to all current problems – and especially material wealth; the influence of drugs stand in for the power and impact of political demagoguery; the sexual misdeeds for the loss of any humanity under the influence of indoctrination and the pursuit of a misanthropic ideology – an ideology that even abuses and misuses young children and inflicts immense suffering on them.As the protagonist realizes in retrospect what he has become - and how far he has allowed others to wake the monster in him - he takes the only logical way out, but his radical, ultimate and irreversible decision to quit the system turns himself into an enemy in the eyes of his former political allies by whom he is abused for his perceived betrayal even after his death.Ultimately, therefore, the film offers no substantially new findings in its sub-text – it is well known and researched what reactionary regimes do with a people -- the Germans know this since the 1930s all too well, too. And to be honest, the chosen artistic representation of this subject matter in A Serbian Film does, to a certain degree, raise the question how far art may go when exploring the psychologically darkest themes imaginable, given how the artistry in ASF doesn't shy away even from the most brutal allegories.One thing one has to concede, however, is that A Serbian Film at least is an honest film - the fury with which the film makers have tackled their topic is genuine and uncompromising. ASF is pure anger distilled into abhorring moving images. The resulting art can only be disturbing, brutal and coarse, and at first glance is easy to be confused with purely self-serving orgies of film violence.No matter what you ultimately think about ASF – accusing the film of being violent for the sake of being violent would certainly be unfair. Its creators were out for more than just superficial shocks. ""There's a method to the madness"", as the old saying goes. That is something one should acknowledge, even if one finds the finished film repulsive.",A Serbian Film

If the point of this movie was only to  shock, that's OK, but where's the plot?... Where is the character  study?  When I talk about quality of this piece of work, I can only say that  the authors could have learned something more from previous Serbian  horrors like Variola Vera, Sveto Mesto, Leptirica etc., instead of  making simply a vain collage of already seen famous shocking scenes  from The Grim Reaper, Hostel... And that's about everything that you'll  see in this horror flick.  As for the film, plot story is a bit tinny. Character study is a  complete slight over and the acting is merely average (with an  exception of Sergej Trifunovic), which is quite typical for Serbian  films in past decade. Picture and music is actually the only thing for  authors to be proud of.  The last thing about this movie that I particularly dislike is  stereotypes and generalization. I ask authors - Isn't it enough that  hole world wants to see Serbs as savages and bad guys?... or you need  to ,,improve'' that picture even more? That what you see in this movie  on the end is not Serbia, that's someone's own frustration.  On the end, I can only say that I was very curious to see this movie  and expected a masterpiece of trill and suspense, but what I've seen,  that's only another shock-therapy full of misery and pathos, like in  other our contemporary films... In other words, a lousy excuse for  movie!",A Serbian Film

281,KZucc,Quick summary: W.T.F.,10,4 November 2012,"I rated this film a 10. I don't condone the imagery, the actions, or pretty much anything about this film. It is a horrid and despicable film and for most of the things that occur within the borders of your screen as you view it, the entire crew involved should be ashamed. However, I do believe film fans can defend the acting, directing, and cinematography as top notch; if you can ignore what's going on of course. Now I've seen some brutal horror films along with the traces of death series and the sort... But nothing.. I repeat, NOTHING has stayed so vivid in my mind as this film has; and that is not a good thing. I can only suggest viewing this if you are a fan of EXTREME film making, and a seeker of films most people avoid (ie, make them die slowly, buio omega, guinea pig series, all night long series, traces of death) and even then, it will still shock. I can't remember the last time I literally spoke the words out loud, ""what the f..."" More than once during a film viewing.

282,oscar-egb-93,Approach with caution..,6,30 May 2014,"It is really hard to be able to give my opinion on this film, but I'll give it a try. ""A Serbian Film"" as you must know, is not a movie for everyone. It contains scenes that threw my whole faith in humanity away. How is it possible to direct or even create a movie with such explicit content?The problem with this film is not the amount of violence it contains, because I have seen much worse in other movies like ""Hostel"" or ""Saw"". Neither is the amount of sex shown what stunned me. The problem is when you combine both sex and violence in the same scene.The film is not bad. In fact it is really well written and the camera work is exquisite. The acting is actually really superb. All violence aside, the movie itself is good. Srdjan Spasojevic does leave a message to the viewer. These things sadly do happen in the world, and even though the film is fiction, things like these happen everyday. He is trying to burst our bubble of happiness to open our eyes to the real world. As hard as we want to deny it, some people are just sick.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. I did like it but it took me a few days to digest. At first I didn't know what to think about it, but at time passed, I concluded that it is a good film, not the best, but respectable. If you are going to watch it, approach with caution. It will shake your whole belief system and maybe cause you nausea. Any movie that can do that deserves respect and admiration from me. If you're an easily disturbed person, do yourself a favor and don't watch it. This is the most disturbing film I have ever watched.With that said, I give ""A Serbian Film"" a 6/10.",A Serbian Film
283,seventhnaga,"Don't call this torture porn, it is much more",8,12 October 2010,"From the beginning I was shocked by what I saw. First shock: those reels of celluloid, whose contents were such that their German printers reported them to the police, are well put together. It's a well scripted film. Confident plot exposition unfolds the character's identities in a natural fashion, the roles of Milos, his wife Marija and son Petar outlined within the first two lines of the film. The script is good – although I can only rely on the subtitles as proxy – but the feel is sophisticated. Not even just adequate, but skillful. When the film reached the point where Milos' son described the feeling of the 'little wheels turning' inside of him, that perfect little metaphor showed me that the film had craft in many areas other than blood letting, which was yet to come; it was a signal that I could stop gripping the armrests so hard and open up to the film. At the apex of the violence within A Serbian Film, at the point of the 'head scene', when for all intents and purposes there should have been people passing out, titters were audible at the screening I attended. At the time I was astonished and appalled – how could this be anything other than a repulsive example of the audience's desensitization? But after further thought I've realised that A Serbian Film can be seen as a farce, and that moment its culmination. Another example, when Vukmir screams his great concept, the ignominious 'newborn porn' in exasperation after the fast exiting Milos, the moment is just as ridiculous as it is vile. With that line and many other touches the film creates a tragicomic farce as cutting as is inhumanely possible. Several times, clips from Milos' porn days are shown and they don't look realistic, they look parodic. Milos with a moustache in a supersaturated blue pool, Milos in a Pink Narcissus-esquire back alley, pneumatic female counterparts and caricature porn acting; elsewhere, Vukmir's slick environment, his suits, always filled glass of Chevas Regal; it's satire. While Hostel et al take themselves embarrassingly seriously, A Serbian Film does not pretend it's real, but an exaggeration of reality; it's comedic, bizarre, symbolic, knowing, even Hollywood. 'A Serbian Film', proclaims the 20s era style title accompanied by traditional Serbian music and the rattle of an old projector, but not for long, the quaint image is literally smashed by the appearance of a replacement title in stencil font with aggressive electronic musical accompaniment. The politics are close to the surface. I had read that the film was an allegory for the treatment of Serbians during recent history, and I assumed that this was going to be heavily buried, if apparent at all, a weak justification of the controversial content, but instead there are numerous direct references to Serbian politics within the film. ""Vukmir"", says Marija of Milos's new boss, ""sounds like one our guys at the Hague tribunal"". Later, a pubescent girl who appears in several scenes of the film is described as a war hero whose honour must be upheld (by Milos doing his next scene with her). When I talked again to the Serbian I had met at the box office before the film, she explained to me that in Serbia there are figures from recent conflicts, war crimes perpetrators, whom some consider heroes, and that Vukmir's 'honour' rhetoric was straight out of this mould. She speculated whether Milos stood for Serbia, his family for other former Yugoslavian states, and the on-looking camera men as nations watching the conflict that tore apart the area in the 90s. I know too little of the history of the conflict to make exact links like this, but it is without doubt that this film is effective as allegory if it can make Serbians themselves relate, speculate, and react positively to a having such a controversial film, one named A Serbian Film, associated with their home country.When asked in an interview with Total Film about A Serbian Film in reference to the genre of horror, the director Srđan Spasojević said, 'I don't see it as a classical horror. I see it as a drama gone to hell.' He's right – it isn't a horror. It gives horror fans too much, the violence doesn't fit into the formula of horror bloodletting, because although grizzled horror vets can admit to enjoying the gruesome bits say, Cannibal Holocaust, it will never be OK to enjoy some of what happens in A Serbian Film and that makes people uncomfortable, and the film an unwieldy prospect. This must be why the horror hacks of Fangoria and Bloody Disgusting are giving A Serbian Film the cold shoulder, with commentors on horror forums saying all kinds of unexpected things, things such as, 'I have ""chased the dragon"" for decades seeing stuff like Cannibal Holocaust, Salo, Nekromantik, Aftermath, etc. But I am here to tell you this film rattled me to my core and I have been reconsidering my stance as a horror fan.' Typical of the comment is that notion that there is a hunger for ever more gore, an addiction, and a scale on which films are placed. Watching A Serbian Film for these fans is like a heroin addict taking a huge does of medicinal grade morphine after years of only incrementally stronger street smack. A Serbian Film cannot be applied to the scale, and it does not dance around the 'line'. Compare A Serbian Film with Salo, Antichrist, Ken Park, but not torture porn, which is nothing more than 'line baiting'. This film really achieves something. You are not entertained, you are shocked. I don't like torture porn, I don't care for horror, and even find the violence in Final Destination unpalatable, but I admire and respect A Serbian Film, and if I ever forgot what it made me feel, I will see it again.",A Serbian Film

What's also a minus is that some of the actors just can't act. There's one scene that I just can't forget.. It's actually the first one after the boy watches the porn.

I was quickly surprised by the intelligence and quality of the production on many levels. I made it through it without having the slightest urge to turn it off. Very stylish and even comedic in parts. This movie disturbed me far less than ""Requiem for a Dream""'s infamous scene, or ""Hostel"". Heck, the mass death at the end of ""Titanic"" horrified me far more.I would compare this film to ""A Clockwork Orange"" (especially when you take into account the more desensitized nature of modern culture compared to when ""Clockwork"" was released) more than any of the torture porn horror flicks I've seen. It is a bit brutal for the easily disturbed, but the worst scenes are obviously faked anyway. The baby sequence brought to mind the infant on the ceiling scene in ""Trainspotting"".

However the film turns out to be a snuff film with pedophilia and necrophilia. The problem I have with this film is it's dressed up as a commentary on Serbian politics and the situation in Serbia (at least that's what I gleaned from the dialogue). Not gonna comment on the validity of the comments the film made but I'm arguing that these comments are not delivered in an intelligent or worthwhile manner. Any commentary I got was just spewed by the character of Vukmir in his conversations with Milos. None of it (to my knowledge) was delivered through clever symbolism and everything to do with the snuff film just served as a ""omg look how brutal this is"" but after a while you just become desensitised to it all. The film literally is just shoving shocking imagery in your face for a reaction and then lazily slapping a commentary on it. As a result, the movie is not fun to watch which is my main complaint. I can enjoy sick twisted imagery and plots but this movie just gave me a kinda empty, sick feeling while watching it. I wasn't invested in the characters or the story so all that was left that the movie could sell you was it's violence and brutality. To me, that felt so cheap and I finished this movie with a sour taste in my mouth because I felt like this was just wanting to be a snuff film while shoving some pretentious politics in there to make it seem like more than the cheap, disgusting farce that it is.On the upside, it was at least technically well-made and acted decently even though I feel genuinely sorry for any actor who had to partake in filming this disgusting script.",A Serbian Film

It starts getting really disturbing about half-way through, and I wasn't bored even during the first half. Despite some negative views I've read, I believe it has a good plot. It is very simple in the fact that you know something big is going to happen sooner or later, and instead of just waiting around bored, there's enough content to keep the suspense going.I'd say there are 2 scenes that are highly disturbing; I almost thought I wouldn't be able to finish the film after the first one, and I have seen a lot of disturbing films. It isn't just what happens, it's the way it's done. Some films like Nekromantik are disturbing but they are so clearly fake that it's a little more weird/strange kind of disturbing.

And although it is just a film, we know things like this do happen and it scares the crap out of me.For once I can't disagree with people who give a film I rank so highly negative reviews, because it is just so sick. But that's what I like about it, and it's not just about the shock factor as it does have a decent plot and could still stand as a good film without the graphic parts. It completely depends what you like in a film, and I personally like the films that make the most impact and stay with me for a long time. Though I really wish this wouldn't...",A Serbian Film
300,credosian,The most extreme piece of revolutionary art/satire ever.,7,13 August 2014,"Monkey rating: 7/10 (because its too disturbing to give it an honest 8)Genre: horror, mystery, thrillerWaddabout: A retired porn actor who is struggling to fend for his family is lured into an undisclosed contract to make a new movie that will pay him enough for a lifetime. Only to realize that the movie is not like anything he presumed and he must fight to protect not just himself but also his family and friends from this trap that is fast closing around him.i say: i have never watched a movie so gruesomely disturbing and yet so artistically perfect at the same time. The only way to see this movie without getting into a moral dilemma is to remember that it is a revolutionary slap on the Serbian government and how its treats its people. This movie is the angst of the people put into a film. It depicts how the people are abused and re-abused to annihilation and beyond by its government and the helplessness of the people in such circumstances. The acting, casting cinematography, music, script and art direction - and make up too are MIND BLOWING. That is even more impressive when you consider the fact that this is a movie of a first time director. A feat almost impossible to achieve.This movie is banned in various countries and that decision is quite controversial, but i must say that i approve of the ban to a certain extent. This movie has really disturbing effects in the mind though it is meant to portray the helplessness of the people of Serbia against its government through its story as a metaphor.Even reviewing it on video was a difficult task for me. as you can see in the detailed video review below, my uncomfortable is evident - and that's a huge thing considering the fact that not many things have the capability to disturb/shock me.",A Serbian Film
301,freejazzclub,serious issues of human existence - but ban it fast!,9,18 April 2012,"First of all, the film is excellent. Superbly done with fine detail. Its music is a weakness among its few, they really could've done a more ""Tarantino"" job on that (or at least an Angelo Badalamenti kinda thing), but the score is not bad at all, its just average, cannot grow up to the film, and not ""arty"" enough for a serious artwork (or at least my taste). I give the film 9 stars of 10 but I think it shouldn't have been made. Why? I tell you. Basically its like an Ibsen-drama, only with gore. In the beginning we see a more or less happy Serbian family, but the shadows of the past come and destroy the almost idyllic present, and the promise of a happy future. A drama with good, lovable, believable characters, well played by fine actors. But the creators have mischosen the genre to generate hype for this serious artwork. And here comes the greatest problem. This film is not just about mindless butchering, rape and torture, but serious issues of human existence. But the average lovers of gore are - no offense - mostly weak in theory, and thinkers are mostly too averse watching violence and cruelty on the newborn rape level. So who and what is this film any good for? And who is it intended for? Anyway I give it 9 stars because its got the potential, its well done, and its a shame that the 98% of its fan-base, (the gore luvin' 17-27yo nerds who watch faces of death and 3 guys and a hammer kinda stuff all day and actually have no soul or whatever I guess) are the reason why it shouldn't have been made and should be wiped out. This stuff is poisonous for the stupid and insensitive, and - in another way - for the smart and sensitive, or just sensitive too.",A Serbian Film
302,lord_of_nalicnod,"Extreme, but not as extreme as it could have been.",5,11 September 2011,"I have just watched A Serbian Film. I understand it. But, what got me to understand it is the fact the plot was already similar to movies I had seen before: It dealt with the similar theme of a heist movie where the down and out ex con is trying to go straight but then is convinced to join one last heist to set him up for life, and as always, it goes wrong. Take this premise and replace stealing money with the pornography industry, where Milo goes to do that last big film to take care of his family. Then you have the subject of obsessions and if they go unchecked they ultimately destroy you and everyone around you. Milo obsesses about his old ""glory days"", Marko obsesses about the life that his brother has, Vukmir is obsessed about creating this new underground sensation. Which ultimately destroys each of them. This theme is prevalent in other films, Nekromantik comes to mind in this.Then you have the part of Vukmir manipulating Milo, making him commit these acts against his will, ala Ichi the Killer.These themes come together then you add the shock value. I'm not going into details about these scenes because they have already been mentioned in previous reviews. In some cases of the most shocking scenes of the film, less could have been more. The ""newborn"" scene could have been far more shocking if there a little less shown. Not much is shown as is, however the context is supposed to be more shocking than what we actually see.As for the ""orgy"" sequence I was at a loss. Because when it is revealed that it is his son, I expected a little more emotion out of it. What I'm saying is that ,you become attached to the family in the beginning of the movie. But, after all the events that take place you almost forget that Milo even has a family, at least I did. An example of much more powerful that revelation could have been: In Pet Cemetery when Gage gets killed and the father's memories come back to us as snapshots of Gage being born up to the present, is far more powerful and disturbing, because a connection is made. It reminds us who the person who died or in this case raped, it to the main character. The revelation in Oldboy, had that emotional connection as well.That's just my opinion. What bothered me the most is the end. The film is greatly filmed and the acting was very good. The film seemed to take itself very seriously until we get to the end. The line ""Start with the little one."" almost ends the movie like it was supposed to be this black comedy or the end to one giant ""Dead Baby"" joke. This destroyed the tensity of the film and kept it from being a strong almost ""thought provoking film"" to a cheap shock fest to get people talking about it ala Human Centipede.Are things in this film horrible: Yes. Did it disturb me all that much: No. This movie seems to be for people to talk about that is not used to watching extreme horror.Films like Nekromantik, Men Behind the Sun and Cannibal Holocaust are far more shocking (and still are to me) than this film. That's why I still own the other's and left this one behind.",A Serbian Film

305,adriana5478,"Wanna be shocking, but nothing apart from that",1,17 August 2010,"This film is very average try of ""B"" horror-thriller. The story remains bleak and full of clichés despite of rather obvious efforts of the screenwriter to make remarkably shocking film. Who likes blood and rape scenes, he might like it, although we could see million times this type of films in past few decades. In terms of the story, directing and general suspense this film is far behind 'The Hostel' or 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Moreoften it is very funny how hard it tries to be 'shocking'. And the FX is so bad, like in student horror films.On the top of it, it is titled 'Serbian movie' in order to attract waspish horror fans from The West who associate attribute 'Serbian' exclusively to something violent. But the setting of the film rather looks like L.A. suburbs than Belgrade. (Some Serb-haters will maybe love it for that.)Director of Photography did his job well as well as two main actors (Sergej Trifunovic and Srdjan Todorovic). But the plot and the whole idea of criticizing Serbian society - which the screenwriter had in mind and which pops out here and there from time to time - by inventing all kinds of human dirt that he could remember, simply remains poor and bordered by genre stereotypes. At the end I thought 'Oh, mine, what a filmmaker can invent in order to became famous'. Only in this sense this is a notable film.",A Serbian Film
306,gardenofbabylon,Makes Human Centipede look like a children's story...,1,13 August 2011,"Unfortunately I have the curiosity for sick and shocking films, and after the unfortunate watch of The Human Centipede I came along to remember this movie although it's been over six months that I've seen it. But, it's still stuck in my mind. Some of the scenes will sure stay in your subconsciousness forever, and will come back as a flash on some of the gruesome details you come across in life and movies you watch after this.The only star I give here is for the camera and good Serbian actors in this movie, everything else is done purely for shock with no artistic value or any purpose at all. I understand people getting here saying this is great and they have never seen such a thing before... But I have a question for those people: first off, are you sure you're sane if your getting turned on by this? 'Cause I'm pretty sure the director of this movie was. Was it really necessary to call pedophilia and necrophilia - art? 'Cause, you know, such people do exist IRL and this movie seems to support all that since most of the pedophiles and necrophiliacs surely did watch it and got another sick idea of what they could do next.Six months ago, when I was in absolute shock after watching it, I thought for a while I wasn't open minded enough, that I lack objectivity about this sort of scenes. Six months later I'm no longer shocked as much, nor am I now easily shocked by anything anymore, but my answer is still: NO. NO, I didn't want to know someone could think of raping a newborn, NO I didn't want to think someone would rape a dead child, NO, I don't want to think about horny father raping his own son until the little one bleeds, and NO I don't find a fellatio easy to watch after the woman has been left with her teeth pulled out of her mouth. Hell NO, this is so wrong on so many levels. But the scene where the main actor uses his ""tool"" to murder a man by raping his eye socket... That is maybe creative comparing to other scenes. Here's a star, you don't get another one from anyone sane enough to call this movie a shocking piece of trash.Remember The Human Centipede I mentioned before? Well, most of the plot you get from Two Girls One Cup and seeing the trailer, but let me hear how you looked your or any child in the eyes after watching this. Did it make you a better parent or a future one? Two words: unnecessary consequences, watch but be prepared for what it brings.",A Serbian Film

As for the movie itself ( as an artistic form) there's no doubt that the production, acting and directing were good. But, sadly, all that (at least for me) falls into shadow of sickening plot.

308,backineltham,"Not at all shocking, but good (I think)",6,22 August 2010,"Perhaps I'm beyond help, but seriously, I didn't find this film in the least bit shocking.Yes, there are some horrible, horrible ideas. *SPOILER ALERT* A man f*cks a newborn baby (possibly to death); the central character decapitates a woman and f*cks her twitching corpse; later, he sodomises his own 8 year old son.Okay, all those ""thoughts"" are utterly vile, but the film maker holds back, every time. And I think that's part of what he's trying to say. The ""film within the film"" is horrible beyond belief, but the ACTUAL film isn't pornographic at all. It's a comment on pornography. It almost mocks those in the audience who really wished they could see the depravity which is only implied. Really, if this seemed like violent porn, watch it again. You don't actually see much at all. It's almost all in your mind.There is, I think, some sort of reflection on the debasement of war, but it's pretty thin.For me, the central thrust (as I've said) is to mock those audience members who truly would like to see this kind of depravity.For me, the big bum note of the film is the very end, when *SA!!!!* the protagonist kills himself, his lover and his child. It seems to say that love and forgiveness aren't possible. But so much of the set-up seems to say that love IS possible.This isn't a work of genius (although the cinematographic is top-drawer, and the acting's good, if not exceptional).

I was looking to find the ultimate shock movie and I sure found it. It's saving grace was the fact there were subtitles which allowed me to look away from the main picture without feeling like a pussy. And I really don't shock easy. It was one of the first times in my life I was thankful of subtitles!This film makes the SAW films seem like an afternoon of children's TV.If you have kids, this film will really make you feel disgusted.

And when it does get worse, and you think it really can't get any worse... It does...

I'm reviewing the art itself, not the surrounding buzz.Werner Herzog once said of WrestleMania that we should not avert our eyes, because this is what is coming at us, and I think the same can be said for A Serbian Film.Credit where credit is due, the lighting and color palette of this movie were extremely impressive. Every scene was lit well for the tone, and most of it is ugly, but with purpose. In the flashback scenes in the latter part of the film, the blown out reds in some of the scenes provided a dissonant color scheme that accompanied what we were seeing well.Technically, this was a well-put-together film, but it's just torture porn at heart. The narrative feels so contrived just to put together these gratuitously twisted scenes, and one could make an argument that the character of Vukmir is the reason for that, but I couldn't help feeling taken out of it by how clear it was that the plot is just a crutch for more baby-rape, necrophilia, etc.Despite giving this a 4/10, I'd recommend it to anyone who can stomach it, simply because I think everyone should decide for themselves whether or not pushing everything to the limit like this is really worth it.I'm not someone who will write off a movie simply for being transgressive art, but A Serbian Film has nothing going for it BUT its exploitative, over-the-top nature.",A Serbian Film

I watched A Serbian Film, and all I can say is that I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed at the film itself, not the film's content. What could've ended as a great erotic thriller became a simple torture porn movie. First of all, the story: A semi retired porn star is offered a lot of money but he has to star in one last film. That's it. The story won't really drag you in the movie. So what's next, the actors: Srdjan Todorovic and Sergej Trifunovic nailed it as the protagonist and villain respectively. Of course, there's a beautiful Jelena Gavrilovic also starring as the protagonist's wife. The acting is one of the best of Serbian cinema, no doubt. This is the strongest side of the movie, and fits the overall dark atmosphere. The cinematography is also great, every shot makes you feel like you watch a Hollywood movie of some sort. And of course, the movie's content. Most of the film's so called ""disgusting"" scenes aren't really that. You can take away the baby rape scene, and the final act, and this would be a great erotic thriller, like Basic Instinct, etc. Final verdict - 5/10 ONE MORE NOTE: Watch the NC-17 cut of the movie, you'll save yourself 19 minutes of your life.",A Serbian Film

He made sure that he pushed in slowly enough that make the infant suffer, ripping it apart so that it would die as it screamed.I still hear it in my head.If no children or infants were harmed, where did the screaming baby sound bite come from? I know the baby in the film was a doll but it still sets me on edge.I've been on the dark web, and trust me, this is almost like a compilation of all the porn on the dark web, strung together with enough depravity to make even the most stubborn and tough viewers scarred for the rest of their lives.Nevertheless, it was well acted and the plot filled me with suspense, tension, fear and shock. 10/10 for shaking me to my very core.I refuse to show this movie to anyone.",A Serbian Film
323,england_andy,Gary Glitters dream house of hardcore family fun,9,28 November 2010,"I once watched a monkey commit rape on bewildered tourists and then go on a wild rampage with a swiss army knife.This shocking incident pales in comparison to the habitual activities of the devastatingly weird and comically confusing main character Milos. His hilarious series of mini adventures is the ideal paradise for all those Gary Glitter wannabes out there.We are introduced to Milos as his son is watching one of the family made films with a hug bowl of popcorn. Milos would appear to have a loving family who have been happy to support a flailing career in the porn industry. Milos is then offered the opportunity of a lifetime, he is offered a role in a secret film for multi million amounts of cash, he is not allowed to ask anything about the film and is not allowed to be told what the film will contain. Why would you raise any questions when faced with this opportunity, millions of pounds for a random film Jake Gyllenhall has been doing this for years.Anyway I digress.Milos just like a modern day cross of Thomas Hamilton and Roy Whiting then embarks on a usual Saturday night where he is pumped full of drugs causing him to have the sexual urges of a 16 year old with downs syndrome. He produces a scene in which his massive erect penis penetrates the eye socket of a pirate. Pirate sex its great.Milos is then faced with what only Joseph Fritzl could understand and that is the activity of Sodomy with his son. not only that but he is smiling as he does this unspeakable act.My personal favourite was where Milos is smashing this filth bird in from behind and then becomes angry at the face that he has to wait until June 2011 to see the final installment of the Harry Potter motion picture franchise. He punches this bitch on the back a number of times until he is so angry only an assault with a machete will compensate for his ill feeling towards the wizard and he hacks at the neck of this skank ho until her head is fully removed, oh and he then continues to smash her back doors in receiving the benefit of her jolting body as her nervous system goes into overload.Reeling with guilt Milos decides that suicide is the only option, thank god Hitler didn't take this course of action, oh wait... He takes with him his entire family only for them to be further sexually assaulted as they lay dead on the family bed.This movie makes me think what it must be like in some of the poorer places in America where family lust and murder is common place amongst home boys.In summary Milos is Nick Mills...",A Serbian Film

The horrors people can do to eachother. Some things we know happen, but thankfully are never confronted with - if we're lucky. I tend to think there is a link to Serbia's past and the horrors that occurred during the Yugoslavian conflict. A lot of horrifying things happened during this conflict, power over others does strange things to the human mind.But don't let us go too deep into conflicts, this movie depicts some of the most graphically disturbing scenes I've ever seen in my life. I will not forget these images for sure. I wonder what a director's thought was when making this movie and generating these kind of depraving imagery There has to be a deeper underlying sense or meaning to this movie. The sole purpose mustn't only be to shock, but I simply can't pinpoint it. Is it about people who don't have any moral senses?A movie about naivity (go into something blindly), money (what if you don't have enough money and are forced to do certain things), masculinity (men cannot control their sexual cravings) family (or what's left of it) or maybe even about life as Vukmir would say, but in a very depraved way. Tread lightly with this movie, it's not easily digestible. Be warned, I'm not gonna warn you again. What you see cannot be unseen.",A Serbian Film

This movie is not a art, it is so much disgusting that I can not find right word to describe it. I watched first half of movie and hope that there will be some kind of sickness, but what i saw later, was beyond my expectations.Raping as scene ...OK, raping when cutting head with sword, let say OK.. But child raping, and some scenes with pregnant women that deliver child, that scenes i watched with finger on FF on my remote control.This kind of movie should never be recorded, should never be in cinemas. I hear that director of this movie say that he only created a movie about things that really exist in reality. Many things exist in reality and we should fight against it, we shouldn't create marketing for it. I have few scenes that still can not throw from my head.If you read this, and if you are sane person - DO NOT WATCH this movie.",A Serbian Film
327,synthetic0812,Mentally disgusting,7,29 August 2010,"Movie is shocking, from the beginning to the final scene. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't open minded. I wouldn't say you have to be with a good stomach to watch this movie, like others did, there are many more physically disgusting scenes in other movies of different genres... I would described this movie more as mentally disgusting and disturbing. Story could take place in any (eastern) European country. But, because I'm local I must say that few things blend very good with Serbian mentality and everyday habits and living... Acting is very good throughout the movie, especially by main character: expressions, interaction with others. I find some things little exaggerated with no real purpose for the story.This movie, very different from Kusturica-type movies which I find boring and based on too many stereotypes, show more talented Serbian cinema, ready to give something new to the world, not to copy from the West (or the East).",A Serbian Film
328,nells_place,Review of A Serbian Film,1,21 July 2011,"The reason I watched this film was because of the 'hype' surrounding it. As a film student and a fan of horror movies, it was recommended to me more than once. During the film, I found it hard to empathise with any of the cast (which I am sure was deliberate), however this meant that I not only didn't care what was about to happen, but I was bored with it. The film did not shock me, as it's sinister undertone was present from the beginning of the film. It bored me. At the end of this film, I was left annoyed that I had just spent an hour and a half watching it. The most shocking film I have ever watched, it still The Girl Next Door (2007),perhaps because it is based on the life on a real person. Either way I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone, it's just not worth watching. It is quite disappointing, even with it's shocking scenes. Which says a lot.",A Serbian Film

330,ld_ross,Too much for nothing.,2,10 December 2010,"Yes, I admit it's one of the most extreme movies I've ever seen. And I always loved the films of Gaspar Noé, and movies like ""Salo."" I didn't like ""A Serbian Film"" at all. And not because I think it was too much... because I think it was too much FOR NOTHING.The film is extreme, but never justified. And I say again, is foolishly resolved.Seriously, when the movie ended, I could not feel sadness or disgust, or anything. I just felt I saw a silly movie that prides itself only by its extreme content.However, something good is this movie, shows that if you want, you can shoot the most horrific scenes of pedophilia, necrophilia and rape, but if not properly resolved and justified, the result will not be disgusting or depressing or traumatic... the result will be just lame.And ""A Serbian Film"" is a lame movie.",A Serbian Film
331,mrhs612-1,Watching this movie is like sucking on a hot piece of garbage.,1,8 May 2011,"I have a very open mind going into every movie I see. I'm willing to enjoy gimmicks and shock just for the sake of shock. I try to judge movies based on whether or not they accomplish the goal they set out to accomplish.This movie does accomplish its goal. So why did it get a 1? Because its goal is to be completely unwatchable.The problem with most of the reviews on here, is that they describe how disgusting and morally empty the movie is, which people read and accept as a challenge. You read a review that says the movie is graphic and violent and you think, ""I wonder how graphic and violent..."" This isn't a challenge. I'm telling you, this movie is bad.I have to admit, I didn't even finish it. I got to the point that every summary said was the starting point at which everything goes downhill, and I didn't make it any further.I know that there are people who want to cross the line with their filmmaking, and there are sick, twisted, sadistic people in the world, but I don't understand how so many people could come together to work on a movie like this. I don't understand what parent would allow their child to be in a movie like this.Yes, there are graphic scenes of pedophilia in the film, and if you're the kind of person that enjoys pedophilia and rape then sure, you should watch this. Otherwise, stay far away from this awful movie.On a side-note, the film-making team on this film have said that this is an allegory for the Serbian government and how it exploits its people. If this was the message they were going for, there are millions of better ways to go about it. Unless the Serbian government personally sends people to your house to force you to rape your own children, while they're raping you, then the filmmakers failed at their goal to create a governmental allegory. And they failed at making a film. Don't watch this.",A Serbian Film
332,TheKillingJoke1991,"It's sick, it certainly twisted but as a film it is really really well done.",10,16 July 2010,"I'm going to be short on this one. Every year it seems a filmmaker comes up with a new twisted idea and makes it into a film. Inside saw the light in 2007, 2008 appeared with the destroying film experience Martyrs and in 2009 Von Trier outed his depression with the almost equally disturbing Antichrist. It seems it was Serbia's turn this time around and , although it doesn't really top the aforementioned titles in the 'disturb'-department, they offer us horror fans a seriously twisted piece of cinematic insanity. The film is made all the more disturbing by the manic acting and nightmarish feel the film descends into in the second half of the movie. Where the first half is more about setting the mood it slowly builds up the story for the second half ,which really is a furious, eerie, feverish, nightmarish and insane descent into ( psychological, sexual as well as visual ) insanity. And boy is it well done. You just have to see it for yourselves just how well the directors knew how to capture all the madness on screen. You can show us all the depravity in the world , but if you don't know how to capture it right your film will fail. Both as a shock as well as a cinematic experience. Martyrs , Inside, Antichrist, Irreversible,... all knew how to work the audience and the makers of this film certainly knew how to too. As for the gore... This film is by no means a gore fest. There are no geysers of gore and blood spurts throwing at you from every direction during the entire running time. It's not as bloody as Martyrs or Inside or Cannibal Holocaust. The captured gore is brief and some of it ( thank god ) is mostly off screen. There are just a few scenes, but when they come they are as vile as it can be. It's more the psychological thought about it which is that gruesome. And one thing is for sure. It certainly will shock you. As a horror film I'd say this is a really really well done piece of work. An instant cult classic. Watch it and rate it for yourself.",A Serbian Film
333,pokeras85,Is this a Serbian film? Yes. Is this a good Serbian film? HELL NO!!!,1,29 August 2010,"This movie is advertised as being the most shocking film ever, but the only thing shocking and extreme about it is how shockingly poor it is made. I haven't witnessed such a meaningless script since ""The zone of the dead"" (another pathetic attempt of Serbian cinematography)and I've seen better developed characters in Sunday morning cartoons. Acting is so wooden that Arnold Schwarzenegger looks like supreme Shakespearean actor in comparison. Also, most of the scenes completely deify logic and lack common sense. The rape scene, which is intended as the highlight of the movie, completely misses the point, and instead of being brutal statement of harsh Serbian reality it is just a morbid mess and should be punished by law. First time director Srdjan Spasojevic proved that he should have stayed 0 (zero, null, cero) times director and that there is a good reason why film critics are not film-makers. On the side note the scene with Srdjan Todorovic in which he threatens the porn director with cutting his own penis is absolutely hilarious! Cinematography is surprisingly decent, but wasted on this god-awful mess of a movie, it fails to impress. Wikluh Sky provides soundtrack that recalls Nine Inch Nails's ""Broken"", and truth be told, it's about 20 times more worthy then the movie itself.Conclusion: Is this a Serbian film? Yes. Is this a good Serbian film? HELL NO!!!P.S. If you want to take a stab at Serbian cinematography, I recommend watching films like: ""I Even Met Happy Gypsies"" (Emir Kusturica), ""Pretty Village, Pretty Flame"" (Srdjan Dragojevic), ""Knife"" ( Miroslav Lekic) or even ""Tears for Sale"" (Uros Stojanovic) - it's a lot better than this crap!",A Serbian Film
334,JonnyGannett,I'm not sure whether to say it was good or bad to be honest.,10,25 March 2014,"Alright so after seeing something so incredibly difficult to watch as A Serbian Film, I feel I must review it. It's hard to put a rating on this movie. It made me feel sick, and most of the time I'd say it's soul crushing, gut wrenching, and grotesque. I can't find a better word to describe the way this movie made me feel other than soul tearing or something, cause it's so traumatizing I feel like my mind is bent to limits I wish it couldn't. This movie shows the worst of humanity, and shows how cruel and disgusting the world can be. I watched the unrated cut, and I feel even more disgusted by this movie than I did when I re watched Hostel last night... I'm not going to talk about anything that happens in the movie cause everyone who has heard of it probably already knows why it's messed up. This review is more about how it made me feel personally. I'm gonna give it a high rating of 10 because 1, the realism of the movie is so incredible. The acting is convincing, and never feels like it's not real. The score is perfect for the feel of this movie. Gritty, and claustrophobic are two words that come to mind. The cinematography is amazing, and the special effects are so realistic I found myself having a hard time telling myself it wasn't real at times. This movie is NOT for the faint of heart. Before you EVER decide to watch it, know what you're getting into first. It's very gory, brutal, and if you've never seen anything like it I wouldn't recommend seeing this film. I for one will never watch it again. But it was good and also bad at the same time. I don't really like how it made me feel, but I suppose it definitely accomplished exactly what it set out to do, and for these reasons I've given it 10/10. If I had to compare this film to any others, I'd say Saw, and Hostel on the violence, and any other film that has graphic sex scenes/rape etc.",A Serbian Film

There I stop with the compliments...First of all, I am from Serbia and I still wonder why did they call it Srpski film (Serbian Movie)... I didn't find any strong connection... Second, there is a line that one may never want to cross, and the movie crew crossed it. The scenes of sodomizing and sadism may be taken as light offense, but the pedophilia and underage sex (better say rape) scenes are disgusting in any mean... You should have a good stomach if you are to enter this movie's story. I won't prolong this review. It's bad, bad for your sanity. It's not whether you can watch it to the last scene. It's about why would you do it, if it brings no good. Seriously, take the Amelia movie and enjoy in happy moments, forget about the Serbian movie.",A Serbian Film

It will jump out, grab you and twist your mind. It won't let go for several days. It won't happen to everybody, though, just those with enough sensitivity.

I've watched horror movies and everything since that and think a lot in that world can be interesting, even fun to watch. This movie is disturbing, and in no way can i get a feel of a political message as they claim.Now to the movie :)Not much too say really. It is a slow starter but is straight forward, their is nothing that requires you to think. Their is actually a little bit good acting in it if you look close, but mostly bad. The storyline is straight forward and except a single scene or two the movie gives itself away from start to beginning. As soon as the sickness really starts, you can afterwards say you've seen into the mind of one sick person and in most cases if your somewhat normal also say you waisted an evening or night. The soundtrack plays a great part in the mood and style of the movie. The soundtrack is perfect for the movie! The camera is actually quite interesting in some ways, quite well shot. Camera and sound is the bearers of the film.In my opinion it is a bunch of crap, but realistically made for the most part and in this sick world it could happen ? ;) Interesting to watch ? Im not sure maybe for some people, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone i didn't know had the nerves and even if so, i wouldn't want to spoil their soul more than it already is.I watched it and I've watched all in earlier and newer horror / gore genres, this is a gore / snuff / necro / pedophile movie, and i regret watching it.It ruined my evening, my mood, this is not entertainment.

A director called Vukmir offers Milos a large sum of money to star in a film. Milos decides to get involved in the project without knowing what the movies is going to be about. Unsurprisingly, the project is of the worst kind and involves child rape and necrophilia.I will not give any more details, but let me get this straight: Everybody who thinks that this movie contains some kind of political/social commentary on the state of Serbia today obviously has serious issues. This movie was shot to shock the audience, nothing more and nothing less. It contains scenes that lack any human decency.

In terms of the general film making skills, it is above average for this kind of film I'd say, whatever you would want to call it. The direction, acting, editing, special effects etc. are good.The ""horror"" aspects of it weren't nearly as disturbing as I expected, most of the violence was implied (sexual sadism, necrophilia, paedophilia, rape and torture). But it was implied well, in that my sanity was repeatedly challenged.Now, and this is the important part I think, I knew about the ""aim"" of the film some time before I saw it, I just didn't quite get it when I actually watched it though. This may be due to the hype, for better and worse, that I was exposed to before I watched it. It may be cultural. Or maybe I'm just an idiot. I wasn't really feeling it in terms of being more than the shock/horror film that it was. That doesn't mean I'm right, this is how I saw it. Watching films like this I think there is a big element of 'how you feel at the time of viewing' in how you perceive it, but I feel a little let down. I had heard it was hard to watch, and it was, but that it had something that would elevate it above other films of this type. I didn't feel it.

This film has limited scope and zero emotional range. Its express purpose is to con the viewer into shock and disgust,as if this will make up for its blandness. That is the bad part over with..Its not funny intentionally,however some scenes will elicit a wry smile for the giant balls the director has for including them. I give the filmmakers a9 out of ten for their brazen attempts to sell this bad film by making it ""shocking"" and ""sick"", and succeeding.You will never be engrossed enough to believe this is actually happening(unless you have severe learning difficulties).Some scenes(the ice cream scene is actually quite funny).But a warning THIS IS A BAD FILM.Its schlocky,gory with elements of porn.I found it quite farcical at times.Milos(the main guy) is hilariously bad,he constantly says he doesn't want to to the things in the film,but does them anyway.Ignore the hype and claims of the censors and filmmakers.This film isn't that bad(its only a film after all.)I give this film a 7 out of ten for exposing film censors and critics with their faux outrage) for the hypocrites that they are.Nothing in this film deserves to be censored as none of it is real,only implied. If you really want to be disgusted and sickened look up bud dwyer,shocksites etc.That is true sickness and horror.there is enough real violence in the world and this film is nothing but false mirror of it.

The film is very well presented with a non-linear narrative, plenty of flashbacks. So on that front it is very classy but on the other hand it has a very brutal storyline and effects. The film as a whole consists of multiple rapes and 'newborn porn' which for anyone with any moral grounding would find it unwatchable.I watched this film because if i see any film that says its 'shocking' i very rarely agree with the statement. For once i have to agree. The first 30 minutes was very pornographic and very enjoyable, but then the story spiralled into necrophilia. which to be honest was not to bad but has put me off the whole male dominance idea.The scenes that followed was 'newborn porn' and paedophilia which i had no idea they was going to portray in such a graphic detail. The ending is very sickening when you find out, that it is his own child that he is raping. The family decide to kill themselves, which is recorded by another director. The film concluded with 'lets start with the little one' while standing over the dead bodies.overall i found this film very sick but with very admirable qualities.

Brilliant.",9,24 September 2010,"Being half Serbian myself and a huge fan of the torture/porn/horror genre i was intrigued when a friend recommended this to me. Having got through Irreversible, ichi the killer, Salo and various other masterpieces alongside the not so classic human centipedes of this century i decided to give ""Srpski film"" a shot. I am not usually fazed or even shocked by depraved films and indeed try and look beyond the gore and shock of initial reactions and find some kind of meaning or positivity that a film like this might contain. With ""Srpski film"" its hard because the scenes are so unforgivable. Each scene i found myself trying to make excuses for and seek the poetic license, but it is very hard in this case.It depends on how you approach this number, if you are an avid horror fan who loves blood and guts and some chuckles along the way, Avoid. If you are expecting a pleasant ride with some bumps and jumps thrown in, Avoid. That said if you can watch with an open mind and try to see past the unspeakable content you may be pleasantly surprised. By no means will you walk away from this film feeling jovial, at ease or even horny, but what you will feel is a slight relief. Firstly because you have finished watching. You have succeeded in watching the whole thing without crying or vomiting or wishing your life away. But secondly because you can see how great your life is and much you love your wife/husband, your children and your parents. And if the film does nothing else but that then i think that is an achievement in itself.Im not going to explain the film or give away any spoilers but i will say that personally although i did not ""enjoy"" this film. I think it is a cinematic landmark. Maybe not masterpiece but certainly landmark and one which will be talked about for many years to come. Its exquistively acted and well filmed. The music is apt and nicely chosen and the choice of colours and effects throughout are necessary and make it a slightly easier ride. There are scenes that will frighten, nauseate and repulse but there are also scenes that will enlighten and impress. Its a deeply depressing film that has touching elements and moments that will leave you feeling heartbroken.

Having sex with a woman while beating her and chopping her head off while still doing it; delivering a newborn baby and immediately forcing it to oral or any kind of sex (yes I do realize it was not an actual baby, but still); not to mention the scene including the ""actor"", his brother, his wife and his own son ...

348,myimdb-264-649673,Srpski Hollywood,5,13 January 2012,"The movie ""Srpski Film"" has been polarizing hyped before and after it's first night until today, which strongly affected and affects the culture of discussion and review about it. I think the movie doesn't justify this discourse and the most radical critics (ban, censorship, etc.) turn out to be its best lobbyists.Generally, this movie is good film-craft. The camera-work is elaborate and uses high gloss and modern visual methods. The music and setting fit very well and create authenticity, like the acting does - solid ""Hollywood-craft"". The hype and polarization are the result of the explicit portrayal of violence and the exceeding of several taboos, although this movie is not a pioneer, but just more explicit than its representatives of the genre, when it comes to rape, homicide, necrophilia and pedophilia.The demands of the movie arouse probably the most controversial discussion. Director Srdjan Spasojevic sees it as social criticism and the portrayal of violence as expression of art. But criticism like that is banal and superficially - emotional and psychological depths had to give way to visual effects. Whoever gets aroused by this movie, she/he had been dazzled pretty much until then. The actual demand is to make this movie provocative enough to sell it best possible. People who look for a drama can confidently watch the censored version. Emotional accessible viewers should avoid the movie, even as horror-fans. It is the first choice for optic-sadists and with the necessary emotional distance, it can be a lot of ""shaking the head - fun"".

I thought this movie went beyond trying to shock people, there is no need for it, Snuff films do exist, and maybe it was a warning to how awful people can be ..well it worked.. I have never come near to throwing up as I did with this film ... It's not a horror film...It does shock you but not in the way one thinks ... please, this is crossing beauty of art with the lowest of humanity ... it is pretentious let's make a film so shocking people will talk about it .. everyone has talent but this is pure pretentious shite... I give it a three but minus seven for the explicit scenes ... this is one revolting film...please this is truly only for sick people.......re-reading this back, maybe this is what the director wanted to show ... that this actually exist ... there are some sick people on this earth.I wished I never had the curiosity to see this film.",A Serbian Film

353,j-aguilar5788,Use's the idea of taboo sex to attempt to shock you.,1,21 November 2012,"I heard about this movie before watching it. From the people that have seen it, they all speak about how disturbing it is. First of all you really don't see anything directly. You are given the idea of something terrible thats going on but that seems to not work anymore for a generation that can find the worst on the internet. Also I hate how they show what happens either through flash backs or the main character watches videos of himself when he had been drugged. Also it was very clear from the beginning that the brother had something to do with his situation and it was no surprise with what happened in the end.There was some extremely funny moments in the movie because of the way over the top killing. But when you see the movie past the taboo sex, the story is really boring and would have been more of a thrilling experience if the main character was forced to do these sex acts because his family was in trouble instead of him being high on drugs that blacked out his memory.If your not used to watching movies that contain taboo sex than this movie will do its job and shock you. But if you are really looking for a violent sex shocker than I recommend Takashi Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"" and for a taboo sex movie I recommend Shion Sono's ""Strange Circus"".",A Serbian Film

356,Deeeth,"Coming from a major horror film fan, I can say its not that fantastic",4,3 January 2013,"This is my first review on IMDb. I felt it necessary to write a review after just completing my viewing of this film. Allow me to start by saying I enjoy bloody horror films, in fact I often seek them out, as may you given you're reading this review. My credentials for this review are well in order. Now. Allow me to explain why A Serbian Film is not that fantastic.Here is the thing about creating a violent and scary film movie. It is all about pacing. Sure, I WANT to see something truly messed up, but it is all about how it is presented to me. Let us point to a movie that is in no ways considered violent or a splatter film. Let us take The Shining, for example. The film has limited violence throughout, sets up with great tension, and then shows me a guy getting killed. Although the death is in no ways violent compared to A Serbian Film or even most other films in the horror genre, I find it more disturbing in that it builds tension and then shows me something graphic. Now, call me foolish for comparing one of the greatest horror films of all time to A Serbian Film, but I feel the comparison necessary because this is where this film fails. It sends you shocking imagery rather quickly and before you know it you just don't care and find yourself writing this film off as another splatter film that tries to hard. The key notion here is TRIES TO HARD. Sure, the level of sexual violence may intensify throughout the film, but it is hard to be fearful of the next shocking scene when you know it will likely be a similar penis/rape/blood/anus Human Centipede idea. The violence in this film sounds like a bunch of 13-year-olds trying to come up with something gross.You can call me a sick man for not being absolutely disgusted by this film. But to be put simply, the film has gross subject manner displayed in a BORING manner. Combine that with a rather uninteresting plot and you have a film that is 4 out of 10.",A Serbian Film

Most of those things don't bother me (maybe weird to say, but it's true), but this movie made me feel uncomfortable.I had heard of this film, and tried to gather a few to watch it with me. Upon describing it, I was left to watch it alone. It does a really good job of not just slamming your face into how messed up it is (though it has parts that do that too), because there are also parts where you're like ""man, this is... really uncomfortable... REALLY uncomfortable"".May I be blunt? If you're reading this and you don't like this comparison, you probably shouldn't even be eyeing this movie. After I watched it, it almost felt like I had been molested. There was a feeling of uneasiness and violation that stayed with me for like two days.

358,jackalmouse,Tryhard exploitative art-house movie,2,2 June 2014,"First off, it actually has a plot that could work, if it wasn't so darned try-hard on the graphical side. I don't as such have a problem with exploitation movies, but the shock value of this kind of exploitation gets busted open and run down into the ground so fast and hard that it just falls flat. The start of the movie is also too 'flat' compared to the rest, which is just way, way, waaaay too over the top.And as a twist, for me personally, it made me laugh twice. Just because of the absurdity of the scenes, which I won't spoil.If you like torture, porn, and torture-porn, with a shoe-horned plot that almost doesn't seem like it belongs, this is the movie for you, but for me personally, it felt way too disjointed in what it tried to accomplish (of which I'm actually entirely sure what that was).It's also really hard to get attached to, or like any of the characters over the movie standing around with a giant neon-sign and shouting 'EXPLOITATION!' at the top of its lungs the entire time.If they had split it up into 2 parts, and dedicated some time to establish proper characters, get a proper flow in the plot, the gratuitously visceral gore would have had a proper effect later on.No investment, no impact in return.Like others have mentioned though; The acting is pretty solid, and believable, if too short-lived in my opin, in terms of character building and establishmnet. The camera-work is also very good!",A Serbian Film

Was it disturbing? Damn skippy, thank goodness I was able to see an edited version that didn't show as much and I think I will still be plagued by troublesome thoughts.
Reading many of the reviewers that have come before me, many compliment the movies artistict styling , lighting, ie whatever. Ok, yeah.. all that may have been great but, I don't by any means consider myself an expert but maybe because I was watching the ""shocked-down"" version and able to notice more, I had a major problem with the continuity in many scenes. Like one minute Milo would be naked, literally the next he was clothed. One scene he was beat-up , the next not as much.

Not a porn, slasher or horror movie, but a very political film. I don't know of any other Serbian artist who pointed his finger and screamed so loud about the horrible crimes his country, army, people and politicians committed during the Yogoslavian civil war against their neighbors. And they weren't actors, but real people, most of them women and children. Compared to the brutality shown in this film those crimes against humanity were 1000 times more brutal and worse. And still, after all these years there have been no excuses from Serbians. And Serbia is not only hiding its major butchers, no, for most Serbians they are still heroes, for raping and killing women and children. And it's written so clear in the title:""A Serbian FILM"". What the director meant was, "" This is awful country with these awful people is Serbia."" Even a decent porno star would do ANYTHING to get out of that hell. THIS CONTAINS SPOILER! And what a mind blowing ending. The director of the movie is not in charge and all powerful.

364,mauraline,Reveals the raw nature and emotions a great director can create in a psychological horror movie,10,27 August 2015,"After looking for some psychological horror movies, I ended up watching ""A Serbian Film"". Do not get me wrong, but this movie is definitely not for everybody. It's great for people that appreciate the art of the psychological conflict a movie can create and this movie does show the raw nature and emotions a great director can create in a movie.HOWEVER, it's deeply shocking, just when you think it can't get worse, it already did. It's highly unlikely anybody will actually say it was very ""pleasant"" to watch, because it definitely wasn't. You could say it was actually very disturbing to watch. The movie has the talent to make the viewer feel very uneasy and absolutely speechless. The difference with this movie and a lot of other psychological horror movies is that this movie is made with an art idea and what really is important in this genre of movies, is that it is shocking, scary but most important it has a factor that makes you not wanting to believe what actually happened, but you do and it sticks with you. I prefer psychological horror over slasher horrors. And if you enjoy (or in this case, have an interest in) watching psychological horror movies, I definitely recommend this movie to you. But be prepared to realize it will have an effect on you for an amount of time, whether it be feeling uneasy or continuing thoughts about what did you watch. For all these reasons it's definitely one of the best movies for this genre in my opinion.",A Serbian Film

From the ""New Genre Scene""(you know which one I am talking about),it spirals down into cacophony of sex and violence which is presented in a format of suspense thriller i.e. our Protagonist have to figure it out why his head hurts and what happened in past few days while he was not in his self.Background scores were fitting to the atmosphere of the movie - it gives a feel that something sinister is approaching. Production value for this kind of movie was actually pretty good.I appreciate that the director tried to include minor metaphor like blood splattered on a historic painting in a movie which was meant to be a guignol drama based on Serbia and hence simply named ""A Serbian Film"" .In conclusion,creators went too far to show their point of view that Serbia is f*****.",A Serbian Film
367,karlbaber-1,A masterpiece of allegory,7,10 September 2013,"So I finally came round to watching a Serbian film. I had put it off for over a year, fearful of what I would encounter when I watched it. Friends of mine, who had enjoyed films like Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, and Irreversible, had enthusiastically informed me this film would make those look like a Walt Disney cartoon. So I started to watch this film with a great sense of trepidation, I had hated Salo, and while I had really liked Irreversible, I had found the rape scene in that movie to be the most difficult viewing experience of my life. I had read that the director, Srdjan Spasojevic, had intended this film to be made as an allegory for what has happened in Serbian over the past twenty or so years. Like many watching this film, I can't claim to know a whole lot about Serbia, but here is what I do know. Since Yugoslavia broke up into several smaller countries, there have been a series of wars fought between several of these countries. The nation of Serbia has subsequently gained an appalling reputation for the atrocities and war crimes it's soldiers and leaders committed. The country was bombed by Nato, and Slobodan Milosevic, and several of his cronies and military leaders have ended up in the Hague on charges of war crimes. Understanding that the film was designed to be an artistic allegory for these terrible events therefore, I understand why the film shows such appalling violence, sexual abuse and paedophilia. The country has been at the centre of some of the worse acts of humanity the world has witnessed in recent times, though sadly it is far from the only country or area in the world where such things have occurred. Subsequently I found the plot to be largely irrelevant. An ageing porn star is tempted into making one last film to secure the financial future of his family. As the production begins, he increasingly becomes horrified by the acts he is supposed to carry out, and by the intentions of the film's director. Appalling things happen to many of the characters, which has caused such public repulsion of this film. For me the power of this film lies in its depiction of ordinary decent people doing despicable things through a concoction of manipulation, coercion and drugs. I would also argue that none of the sexual scenes are designed to be erotic or stimulating, and the violence, while shocking and graphic, is never suggested to be satisfying or justified. Finally, and this is an important point, the sexual abuse of the child characters is suggestive and never actually shown on camera. The film makers have pointed out that the child actors were protected from the violence and sexual content of this film. It goes without saying that the film is far from perfect. I personally will never watch this film again, but I can at least appreciate the intentions of this film, and see it as more than an excuse to put as much violence, nudity and shock into a movie as possible. This is something I was unable to do with films such as Salo, Cannibal Holocaust and I Spit on your Grave.",A Serbian Film

This movie is not meant to be seen. At all. I don't mean, ""This movie is not for the feint of heart."" I mean, ""Do not watch this movie."" It's hard for me to put into words how much of a negative impression this film left on me mentally. In the beginning, I was confused as to how many viewers were so lastingly disturbed by this film. Do not get me wrong, the first half of the film is disturbing, no doubt about it, but I was able to dismiss it as film and, although difficult, I could forge ahead. But the second half of the film is absolutely disturbing, and even the thought of it makes my stomach churn. Gore is not so much of an issue if you are seasoned in the genre of disturbing movies or even horror in general. It is the context of the gore and violence that really takes a toll on the viewer. I consider myself somewhat of a seasoned veteran of disturbing flicks, and I was fully ready to be disgusted by this movie. However, I could not foresee the absolute horror I was in store for.

375,donfilipo,Made to provoke,9,6 October 2010,"Actually first time in 50 years i'am sad that English language is not in any useful operational writers condition with me, so i must be limited on simple and limited words and sentences. Any stupid or unusual word connections are logical, as i would be quite able to write in Serbian language, since i lived in the same shared country (Jugoslavia), but never been to USA, or any other sweet countries with Rambo and Dracula, taken only as pure entertainment:) Meet the evil. In it's purest. Serbia had met him. As country it's not alone. But Serbia as a country, has still amazingly a lot of creative power (specialy in film:) to try on various ways, to introduce it to world audience. And as you might not believe, the devil is represented in an fictional, but quite believable story. Pure evil servants which are cruising around countries, which lost every dignity, moral, and legal norms which once had, and had fallen apart, like they never existed, are painted in extremely realistic way. If you would be careful, you would find them in your country too. But of course, we see them sooner, cause we were not so used of them:) The devil promised to everybody prospect, and a lot of money, for a little more of dirty or naughty 'job's', he would so or so do, with incapable locale semi-amateurs. It's not just porn. Porn is a figure of expression. I believe, the tragic story of a porn actor, is not meant just as a story about individual porno actor seduced in child porn and snuff. It's more. It's a figure about a happy people, who had their small sins, actually not just quite small in purist US standards, we off course did not had porn but communism. That was our sin. And to live better, we have accepted the pure devil's contract. After that, we had war, criminal gangs on power, criminal's actually gaining the most important positions in politics, and true, we got porn too. And with your purist Terminator eye:) you off course can not see, that it's not the porn, which brings the pure evil. Innocent and stupid jerk stuff is just a mild symptom. There is a lot of not so innocent and actually artistic and philosophic snuff behind in a story of people who lived in kind of a distorted moral system (a porn actor is quite a god metaphor:), which was communism, and is now accepting the devil's contract in a small everyday and everybody's greed, for more money and secure life.If you see the provocation this way, and not as simply depicting the troubles of an alleged porn industry in Serbia, you will See more, and you will See right. The graphic provocation is off course a cry out lout of an artist. An loud outcry that maybe some sensible soul will hear. But as i can read, we are pretty as much deaf in the modern world, as we were in the times of cave man. Maybe with loud music and shiny commercials even more. I expect even the famous Slavoj could fall in the story, somebody is trying to depict Balkan as wild beast country. No gentlemen. Wrong. The devil came from somewhere else. And we are not a single percent in normal or even semi normal conditions (like Yugoslavia once had:) more pedophiliac, pornographic, sadistic as anywhere else. It's true. We don't hide the devil in tradition. It is believed, you can somehow, by exposing it, cast it out. Just like in old exorcism myths:) And here, although most of quite well educated ex-Yugoslav people off course do not believe in old mythical devil, i must admit that exposing pure evil, is the only chance to expel it. If you hide him, he will come out some day much fatter and uglier:) There of course is a lot of heroes exposing a brutal materialistic and greedy thought, which is a gentle melody for pure evil. And it can be done in quite ordinary and effective way. Noam, and the same Slavoj are quite effective in this kind of expression. But there is also another kind of expression. An outcry of an artist.Porn? OK. You earn money. More money? More porn:) Well believe me, the devil or some hidden socio-psychological mechanism will take care, that this, if possible, will go wrong, except for mightiest devil servants maybe:) And remember porn is not even mentioned in bible:) In movie, porn is just a metaphor for a lot of distorted human morality this days. And off course it still helps some pure evil servants to hide the outcry of the artist. And maybe artist just wanted that deaf and 'pure', won't be too much offended. They have off course their Rambo. But on the other side, they also have Tarantino. Maybe they should once in a while think about that outcry of violence too. Or is it even Tarantino just a kind of violence 'jerking' stuff nowadays?",A Serbian Film

What makes this movie horrific is the content. There is a specific scene to do with a very newly born child that has stuck with me since I watched it. And various other scenes that could cause some people to be traumatised or at the very least triggered. I've watched a lot of banned and gory horror. But this one is in a category of its own.

The movie is in my opinion the most horrific horror movie I've ever seen. Not for faint hearted, this goes into deepest triad of human psychopathy, and brings you to the source of almost extraterrestrial pure evil.
It has political connotation, it is an allegory to the events after 1990 in the Balkans, a decent well respected country disintegrated during few bloody wars into 7 pathetic clerical fascism banana republics. State of mind of the population is still like in the first phase of the movie, and it should be in its last minute, to understand what have they done.Therefore, a whole army of pro-Serbian maybe even regime - paid bots are downgrading this movie rating here. All negative 1 star comments are by people with Serbian names.

From mainstream Hollywood to really obscure ones, movies you haven't even heard of let alone watched.He, his co-host and a guest would comment after each clip in a very entertaining way.In retrospect, you realize that you actually witnessed his thought process while writing this movie in real time.Considering his knowledge of horror movies and movies in general and his distaste for Lucio Fulci (shock for shock's sake and misreading of Mario Bava), I'm actually surprised how much of the scenes do exactly what he claims he doesn't like: they're shock for shock's sake.Now, the blame for this could be levelled at the director, but very little or nothing has been altered from the original script.As for the title ""A Serbian Film"". It's a riff on Dusan Makavejev's Sweet Movie.Does The Texas Chain Saw Massacre represent America? Does Martyrs represent France? Does Ichi the Killer represent Japan? In other words, don't read too much into it.This movie is a half-baked allegory on the sad state of Serbian film industry, I can already hear the laughs: ""Serbian film industry?

I began reading reviews from this section just to help my mind, and I found that these kind of films pose an interesting issue: should movies be evaluated according their moral and ethical contents? Or should they just be qualified for their technical (this would also includes acting and screenplay) aspects?For example, many reviews point out the hard and explicit violent-sex scenes, but it is important to say that these have good cinematography and are well decorated -the production design helps you feel you are in constant danger and in a horror menace. Acting for instance, it's not the best, in any character, but at the same time its edition is fair enough.

It does remind me of Salò by Pier Paolo Pasolini, same concept but these movies make you think...the film director in the movie is just another Hitler, another Ceausescu, another Saddam Hussein. Human beings are just actors of those twisted-mind dictators!

It transcends horror because of its reality, more so than Hostel or Human Centipede, it is a fearless piece of filmmaking about the underbelly of humanity and exposes the fascism of political correctness, especially with Siberia but also today's New World in general. And though this film is presented as a metaphor by Spasojević, anyone who believes this film is simply a work of sick fantasy is either naive or in denial. Mind you, that being said this film certainly does pushes boundaries like no other in cinema, I didn't think anyone could match the intensity of ""Frontiers"", ""Martyrs"", and ""Inside"". I have to say viewer discretion is advised for this film, it is definitely not for the weak mind and/or stomach. Also if you've reached that point that nothing shocks or disturbs you anymore, brace yourself for this.if you're sick enough to revel in the degradation and humiliation of the human form as it is depicted in A Serbian Film, you can look straight past the film's intentions and enjoy it for a cheap blast of ultra-violence, or of course not enjoy it at all, yet that would escape its purpose. Spasojević has cultivated an experience that, for the majority of people, is repulsive and uncomfortable, and intentionally so.A Serbian Film is uncompromising in its depiction of violence, sexuality and depravity, and will more than likely leave you feeling exhausted, angry, and maybe even a little depressed.

What I really think is happening is that the director is trying to show the depravity and disgusting nature of humanity, but only where he is most familiar: Serbia. And it does not really come to be truly revealed until toward the end when that gruesome sex scene, when the director says, ""This is a Serbian family."" And after Milos has bashed his head against the concrete and he says, ""This is the movie. This is life."" I can't speak for any Serbian, but those two small sentences, to me, convey the sentiment of which the director is trying to speak. That is HIS take on Serbia and the depravity and despicable nature he witnesses. It's all there almost: violence, abuse, perversion, drugs, sex, greed, money.

It's so much easier to do that than to make a good movie...This movie does not contain violence and repulsive scenes to emphasize some point in artistic way, it's just an unengaging plot mixed with collection of gore scenes without any reason except to try to be the scariest movie ever. And it fails there, too.Here in Serbia we don't get many home-made movies per year, and I'm always sad (and maybe even angry) when I see wasted opportunity like this. Main two actors are very famous here and it's really devastating to watch them selling out.If you are new to Serbian movies, check best works of directors such as Aleksandar Petrovic, Emir Kusturica, Slobodan Sijan, Dusan Makavejev and Goran Paskaljevic instead.

414,joycee2000,"Anti-Serbian film, made to prolong and perpetuate stereotypes of demonized Balkan people, title says it all",1,18 July 2010,"I am writing this for fairness and justice without any other motivation: This is a politically motivated film. Why? One or two decades ago, several powerful countries needed to tailor public opinion into an intervention in Balkan conflict. They did so by demonizing the people and completely distorting the line of events, an approach/version followed religiously to present day. Nowadays, when some elements of real truth start coming out, changing perceptions and many take notions that not everyone from Balkans has a villain tag on his forehead - the establishment comes up with this stereotypical unfounded and ""politically correct"" story reiterating every single bit of media madness of the 90s - sick aggressive and deranged Balkan male always willing to settle any issue by rape, murder, torture, people of mythical mindset living in the past and taking revenge on the world for not having everything the way they want to. The fact that director is Serbian as well as actors does not disapprove my point. I do not care if some director makes an exploitation movie or a movie with sick themes. That movie could be called ""slashing movie"", ""chopping and raping movie"", however when you call it ""serbian movie"" this gets clear political motivation. Being from the Balkans, I have seen many Serbian movies, authentic movies, ones with real local spirit and humor, those that reflect local culture. And, I can tell you, that authentic Balkan movie is not a hollywoodized, 100% westernized broth. Therefore it is obvious that this movie is not made for local audience: it was made for some other audiences or purposes. Now, this is not the place for me to prove Serbian people are totally unlike this; I know they are. Nevertheless, in spite of perhaps being done well, this movie will always remain a crime towards truth and humanity, just as if you watch ""The hurt locker"" you will believe all Iraquis/Arabs are evil terrorists who live on killing friendly Americans. Same goes for some movies about Viet Nam, and you can also believe that Serbs are ""a bunch of illiterates, degenerates, baby killers, butchers and rapists"". Is it really a coincidence that this movie resembles previously quoted words of Joe Biden uttered on Larry King show during 1999 intervention in Serbia?

416,meccanici,Every exploitation trick in the book . .,2,25 July 2010,"This review contains spoilers - and descriptions of scenes depicted in 
 Srpski Film.
 
 A baby is graphically birthed on screen by a large bald man. The mother 
 lies prone, and pushes the baby out into his hands. He then takes down 
 his underwear, and rapes the screaming newborn baby - on screen.
 
 A man is shown violently anally raping (onscreen) a young child - his 
 own son, after he is injected with massive doses of a powerful sexual 
 stimulant. The boy - presumably also drugged - lies face-down, bleeding 
 profusely from his anus as the man continues a sustained sexual attack.
 
 Evidently, this is art.
 
 The thing that bothered me the most about Srpski Film isn't necessarily 
 its use of deliberate shock, and taboo busting scenes designed to 
 offend. It is the way in which Srdjan Spasojevic tries to cover his 
 dubious tracks by passing it off as some kind of artistic political 
 allegory about life in Serbia.
 
 I was aware of the fact that I was increasingly annoyed as I watched 
 this film - mainly because the filmmakers use every trick in the book, 
 and obviously some new ones to batter the viewer over the head with 
 aggressive imagery, in order to make enough social fuss to draw in 
 viewers. It doesn't necessarily make it a good film, although it is 
 admittedly well shot, and well acted.
 
 It almost reminded me of seeing footage of beheadings on the internet. 
 It's supposed to be profound in some way, but ultimately it is just 
 irredeemable pain and destruction, and contains no social commentary at 
 all.
 
 Realistic torture and extremely graphic rape scenes usually make a 
 negative impact on the viewer, because they are horrific and unpleasant 
 subjects. Using babies and children does not make it artistic, 
 independent of your cultural origins - although some people claim that 
 it is art. I saw another review of this film that evidently recognised 
 genuine ""art"" in every single frame
 
 I, like some of the other reviewers - have happily watched horror and 
 exploitation movies for years - but so what? It doesn't make any 
 difference whatsoever. Sub-genres come and go, and the recent tide of 
 shocking torture films are more akin to a test of the viewer's resolve, 
 than the slices of entertainment they used to be. Fair enough - if you 
 don't like them then don't watch.
 
 I am a film fan. I definitely love film. I just don't love this kind of

417,zigzagzigzag,"Art is supposed to make You feel - and You will, for sure...",8,30 July 2010,"No real spoiler for this movie (even if I^m being overcautious with IMDb administrator ;), because it has to shock You in order to deliver its message. And it will come to you...even if some time passes until the nausea abates.It is about Evil - simply and beautifully displayed. No supernatural demonic forces, but simple human greed, voyeurism, envy, manipulation, and, yes - incredible capacity for violence in humans.And this Evil is shown both in a metaphor of political/institutional/leadership manipulation (""taking part in a movie without knowing the script and being promised ""big money"" in order to do it"") - as on the individual level, as well.""Sensitive souls"", who nevertheless are more then able to quickly forget the real suffering of some ""barbaric, foreign folk"", after seeing it on the evening news - will surely want to ban this movie. However, 98% of those who yearn to overcome the ""evil ape curse"" of our species will seek to improve their own version of ""being humane"" after seeing it. Even if they thought before that, that ""being bad"" is kind of sexy. Yep, after the nausea abates. Which will take a long, long time.Sure - one can nag about this or that, score or camera, blah-blah-blah....but I see nothing bad in calling Evil - Evil.As KNOWING about Evil in the world did so little to stop it - the true role of Art, which is to make people FEEL, just might have its own, better chance.p.s.

418,james-bloodmoon,Not shocking or fully hardcore,7,5 August 2010,"Its funny how people always go on about how violent and graphic a film  is, when it isn't. I've seen scores of gore films, from Lenzi to  Argento to Deodato to Ittenbach to Schnaas to Bethmaan to Iskanov, to  documentaries like Traces of Death and Faces of Death, to modern gore  like August Underground and Murder Set Pieces and Eastern gore like  Human Pork Chop, Man Behind the Sun (all of them) Dr Lamb and virtually  everything in-between. Some I've seen twice or more.  A Serbian film is OK, but the directors definitely didn't go all the  way. The basic story is an ex porn star who's given an offer he can't  refuse. The problem is most of the sex is carefully shot so if you  expecting non-stop gonzo with gore look elsewhere. Speaking of gore, it  is very well made, but the other bits of the film show the director  didn't push it to the limit, which is a shame. Well worth seeing  though.

There is a deeper message, a political message, regarding the recent historical events (1990-today) in the Former Yugoslavia and how the country has been torned apart by external and domestic factors, how Serbia (family) has been destroyed within and finally some others will exploit its remains. The shocking factor and the graphic visuals, incest, rape, torture is a straightforward representation of the civil war crimes and the corruption in a social and personal level.

425,richardshebopper,"I enjoyed it a lot, so does that make me a sicko ?",8,29 November 2010,"I went into this film expecting to be shocked, so had already raised my guard. I knew that a newborn baby was going to get f**cked, so wasn't expecting anything that I couldn't handle.What I didn't expect was to find the film fully credible and really well made; to have a story and a cleverly thought out plot and conclusion. I expected slash and gore from the first minute, to shout 'give me a break' a few times at some corny scenes, not much else. But none of that... it's very well directed and perfectly credible, albeit completely unbelievable.Our porn-star main character is really concerned about his actions and really loves his family. He's not some sort of sadist. He doesn't believe in screwing women while kids are looking on and neither does he like beating up women while having sex. I wouldn't call him a nice guy exactly, but he's someone getting more and more stressed, drinking more, doing things he doesn't want to do. Getting injected with super bull-doses of taurine only makes our hero even more stressed and rampant, forced into crazy actions by a crazy director - representing the crazy Serbian State - doing everything against his will, gradually going mad, but... sometimes making surprisingly good decisions at the last minute.The main character is forced into doing horrendous stuff and reacts, overall, really well. He's not just some mad, axe-wielding geezer, terrorising people with his penis.Beyond the superficial horror façade of this film, of which there is plenty, people have been massacred and tortured throughout history, but the film's not trying to glamorise that, nor the terrors of Serbian past. There are crazy politicians and dictators out there making people do crazy things and this film manages to reflect that. It's not a pointless horror film, just for the sake of shocks and gore.I really enjoyed the film. I wasn't quite as shocked as I expected to be (naturally), but found it compelling and not at all ridiculous.There's not much to chuckle at, let's face it. OK, ""newborn porn"" and the way it was championed by the director was quite humorous in retrospect, but there's a deeper message here...",A Serbian Film
426,kedar1395,Why does this exist?,5,28 February 2012,"To start off, the film was very well done and was shot with talent and developed the character of Milos very well. However, the subject material in the film was over-the-top and traumatizing and clearly designed to shock the average viewer. There were a number of shots that were clearly unnecessary and served only to scare the viewer to tears. Despite the sadistic nature of the film, it did capture the effect of porn on the lives of people and the disturbing nature of some people in this world. The film cannot market itself as a social commentary because it was too grotesque to be considered a real movie. SPOILER ALERT: When the rape/beheading scene came along, myself, and the two other men I watched it with, screamed, held hands and sobbed into each others' shoulders with a pillow covering our faces and ears to protect us from the sheer horror.I give it a 5 out of 10 because it was very well done.

430,msnklc2,"the ""art"" market freedom",1,17 January 2011,"I have seen the trailer for the ""movie"" and have skimmed over the comments on the website. Am I going to look for this product ? No. If somebody takes a pile of crap and makes a sculpture of that, which is technically holding itself and presentable, and a community allows the exhibition, because of the ""artistic freedom"" - why should I go to see it ? To test where is my limit of tolerance for sniffing the crap, of how close I can do it, or how much I am not ""weak hearted"" ? To see this product as the motivating factor for improving my humanity, as some ""forensic psychiatrist"" said here, is even less of a reason, as that person is spending his life with the pathological cases and has a slanted point of view that is not of much use to one average person who can improve his or her humanity in much cleaner way than by going to the exhibitions of the crap art.What is not clear regarding this product, is how the human society can allow marketing and production of products like this one, considering the child pornography, for instance, is universally banned ? How is it possible that on the US market this product is freely available and no one goes to the jail for the possession of it ? How is it possible that an Eastern European society, no matter how weak, does not ban making of a product that is much worse for the health of the human society than making of the child pornography ? Is that called the western freedom that is now getting imported in the east ? Is it the market freedom that is spreading with the globalization ? I think the people who made this movie had to spend more than a year thinking about it, and anyone who does it that long cannot be quite in the right mind; therefore, I checked out on-line the director and the script writer and found these are socially functional individuals, but with ugly streaks in character. Is it how the societies function today, that semi-pathological types become artists and as such are allowed the freedom for delivering to the market products like this one ? The possibility of having this product on the market is disturbing because it indicates the serious flaws of the western idea of freedom. Apparently both in the east and west we live in the rotten societies that are not able to recognize and satisfy the needs of their citizens. Catering to the pathological minority - from them to them - without restrictions, is an immature concept of freedom.",A Serbian Film

Also, a decent plot twist at the end, an overhaul of European censorship policies, the porn industry and an extreme example of the length some people will go to for 1. Money and 2.

At least you get a good impression on what's going on in this movie. So where should I begin in understanding the metaphorical tones of that movie? I can find ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to justify any of the actions listed above. Is a father raping his son next to his wife, who gets raped by his brother, like a metaphor of the government, trying to raise your taxes? I can't tell - and I'd be glad if ANYONE who gave this movie more than one star could tell me, where I can find a message in this movie.If ""a broke man reaching for every little bit of money"" is the message - well that could be told without having a dozen people molested, mutilated and murdered. If you have problems and want to address them there is always a possibility that doesn't involve rape, decapitation or sex with the dead.Those Serbian guys are just sick in their minds and I can't imagine anyone with such a rotten mind that they can focus on details like blood spraying on thighs of a boy that is just being raped by his father while lying next to his mother.I never thought I would quote Eric Cartman ... but I do it again: ""Seriously .... the f*** is this?!""",A Serbian Film

435,KateTheWatcher,This film isn't art and doesn't even have overlaps with art!,1,28 August 2011,"I'll be concise: this film bothers me for 2 reasons. Firstly, it's his falseness. Yes, I am sure the story can be real. Of course, I didn't expect to see real rapes, real killings. But that wish of showing everything still using tones of fake blood, fake genitalia...I mean the director, obviously, worked in the way that Eco defines kitsch as a painting of food that makes us hungry (that being kitsch, because it's cheap, a surface success).Secondly, is that the film isn't scarring us, all in all. It doesn't shape our conduit, it doesn't give us an intimate insight of a criminal's mind, in fact, it just shows, doesn't express a thing. Even the great acting that others praise is an overacting, for a film to be good there is no need to even act (Udo Kier claims that Trier told him not to act in one of his films but too simply be). So, the peril that awaits the watcher of the film is to just to remain with some wicked scenes in his mind for a while and to start feeling accommodated to them. I invite everyone to watch Haneke's ""Benny's Video"", Merhige's ""Begotten"" or to look into Hermann Nitchs's activity, than compare those to this film.

(unless the hidden message is you are F***ed from Birth) So here's my review of it being an ""AS IS"" film. Read on.. I have seen some hard hitting horrors in my time, ""Saw 1-7"", ""I spit on your Grave"" ""The Tortured"" ""The Loved Ones"" Only to name a few. Well the films listed above, compared to the s**t in ""A Serbian Film"" is, well, it puts the others on Par with Bambi! It makes ""The Human Centipede"" Seem like a comedy! This film, in my opinion was just sick. There are actually no words to describe it, or how wrong it is, its awful! I am not going to comment on the camera work, as clear as the picture may have been, what you see, and more importantly *WHAT YOU DON'T SEE* IS what makes this film so disturbing.This film has no solid storyline, just a rather pathetic plot. Middle aged, out of work porn star, desperate for money, so he gets sucked into a darker world of porn. I'm going to go into detail of the ""newborn Porn"" scene, so if you don't want to read this, just shuffle down to the next paragraph. It was awful. You do not see the baby being penetrated,but as I said, its what you DON'T see that is disturbing, because this film has a way of putting that image in your head. You do not see the baby being hurt, only see his/her crying face, but to hear the screams, That YES may be FAKE or whatever, is terrible. To see the mother witnessing a man raping her child, not even a minute old, and smiling, is beyond all human decency. If you watch this film, when you get to the scene where you see the pregnant woman, Fast Forward, or put it on mute and leave the room for about 5 minutes. This is why people are saying ""what's been seen cannot be unseen"" Please DO NOT watch this. I can see this film getting banned very soon. AGAIN, AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS.

The latter for me,2,6 July 2011,"OK where to start with a Serbian Film...Firstly I'll say this is the most shocking piece of cinema I have ever seen. I am a fan of horror and have seen some of the more extreme films but I thought this was on a different level (and not in a good way).After watching this I truly felt unsettled and that's pretty rare for a film to have that effect on me. Some people have argued this film needs to be looked upon for having a deeper message a social commentary on family life, politics, class systems etc but in my opinion that's wide of the mark. There are ways to show those kind of factors without resulting to what ultimately this film does - shock value. In that respect this film succeeds because if this does not in some way shock you or leave you feeling uneasy then you need help! lol. This film chucks it's moral compass out the window and delves as low as the human spirit can go. I will admit that the cinematography is good and the actors give very good performances but ultimately I can't get past the fact I feel this film was made to shock people and I did not get a sense of a deeper message.There is no way Id want to watch this film again or recommend anyone watching it even the hardest of exploitation cinema fans will find this hard to stomach.",A Serbian Film

I have looked for so long for a film that suits my sexual needs and brutal mindset and I have to admit that the only thing that lets this film down is the fact that you have to miss some parts of the film to keep up with the subtitles.I love the way the story is told, from its linear opening to its non-linear flashbacks shown through a mixture of tapes and memories, in which we learn about the main characters lost three days as he does.By now everybody has heard of the 'newborn porn' scene and in all honesty, this part slightly disturbed me and would have put me off the film completely, were it not for the excellent camera angles that show only the main characters facial expression from that of interest to that of genuine horror.The plot twist at the end was a bit of a surprise and fits perfectly with the message of what people are willing to do to get just one session alone with a beautiful woman.All in all, I believe this film to be a good representation of the urges that society has forced many people to repress, and for a quick relief I can think of nothing better.",A Serbian Film

The background music was very original (seriously orchestras get boring after a while).#SPOILER The whole pedophilia scene was a bit disturbing.

444,sims_baby_ilove_bobby,Mixed Feelings,5,2 July 2011,"A Serbian film was one of the most sickening, graphic but clever films I have ever seen. Considering the disgusting plot, the plot is also very clever and unlike any plot I had watched or read. Throughout the film I thought to myself ""who could think of such a disgusting plot"", the same with Human Centipied. Besides the plot it is really just a soft porn, snuff movie with lots of disgusting features, I am only rating it a 5 star because apart from the clever, crazy storyline it contains some very disgusting and graphic scenes from Milos raping his wife to him raping his young son right at the very end, which was very, very shocking. I would NOT recommend to any one of the faint heart that has children or is very family orientated because the film is just shocking when it comes to family but I would recommend, if you could recommend this film, to anyone who likes sex and gore and anything truly disgusting.",A Serbian Film

That being said I have NEVER seen a movie quite as disturbing and maniacally depraved as this one. You might be asking yourself why I gave A Serbian Film 9/10 stars then and Its because as messed up and putrid as this movie is, it's an exceptional piece of exploitation art at it's finest. I don't think I could ever sit through this movie again and that's what made it so good.(or terrible) the director really knew what he was doing if his goal was to make you cringe in horror at what happens in this movie. The story is messed up but well constructed with an even more disturbing (to say the least) ending that will make you feel like your soul just got raped. If you can't handle extremely vile, depraved, putrid sex and gore then don't even attempt this flick.

I'm quite prepared to sit through disturbing scenes or watch films that deal with uncomfortable subject matter, if they enhance the overall story. However the makers if A Serbian Film seems to have worked so hard on trying to shock, they forgot to worry about the story at all.There are scenes in this film that many people will be appalled by. That in itself it not a reason to avoid it. But the sad fact is that this film has no redeeming features whatsoever. The storyline is flimsy, there is no 'message' being conveyed, as some apologists have claimed when trying to justify it.The acting is not dreadful, which is why I haven't given an even lower score.

448,rickse,Why?,4,5 September 2011,"I've seen the movie and read a fair number of reviews, and here is my take on it. Every now and then, a filmmaker comes out with a movie that tries to up the anti on the sheer awfulness in attempt to disturb us. In the case of ""A Serbian Film"", the film has indeed broken new ground in regards to sex with children and newborns. But seriously, why go this direction? There are so many over avenues to up the anti on the excesses (rape, torture, brutal violence, gore, psychological stuff, etc.) There are so many other ways to make a truly disturbing film, without the need to involve children or newborns (the film actually is successful on the other fronts as well). I'm just really concerned that other filmmakers are going to take note of this one, and take the genre in a new direction. I really hope this does not happen. Let's leave the kids out of this kind of movie.",A Serbian Film

I had no idea of what this film was about except for the fact that it was a ""horror"" film, which clearly was the reason I tried - yes, TRIED to watch it. After about 20 minutes I turned it off! It was right after the first real ""filthy"" sequence. What I saw was something no one should portray in a movie. It was something you should be locked up for doing so! And having seen that makes me sad, because I have never ever even had the thought of this - now I have it even in real picture inside my head! I don't know if this is normal stuff in Serbia, but what the h*ll is wrong with the world today if you can make a movie like this and sell it legally. I know it's just a movie and it's fake, but it's not like the old days where everything looked so fake you would laugh. It looks pretty real in 2010, and making / even thinking scenes portraying the rape of an infant baby makes it illegal and punishable in my eyes!

452,keithprestontaylor,The Critics Were Fooled. You Shouldn't Be.,1,23 October 2011,"Last week, I watched 'A Serbian Film' in its uncut form. I made the decision to watch the film - despite reviews cautioning me against its 'extreme' content - for multiple reasons, primarily because I am not squeamish when it comes to film (I was certain I could 'take' whatever these filmmakers threw at me), and because I was curious to see how *any* film could possibly elicit such a visceral reaction among even those who have not seen it, not to mention its audience.So, having seen ""A Serbian Film"", what can I say about it to those of you who might be thinking of watching this film for yourselves, perhaps for the same reasons I watched it? First, let me assure you that the reviews of 'A Serbian Film' here and elsewhere don't begin to scratch the surface of this film's depravity. Yes, this film depicts both incest and child rape. But these moments of the film – horrific as they are – were hardly the worst of this film's atrocities, as they either take place off-screen or are otherwise left to the imagination.More distressing – to me, at least - are the many elements of 'A Serbian Film' wherein the filmmakers marry sex and violence in the most brutal, graphic ways imaginable. The most barbaric of these include a man raping (and then ejaculating on) the body of a woman whom he has just beheaded; a man using his penis to suffocate a woman who cannot bite down on him as she gasps for air because her teeth have been ripped out; and one man killing another by shoving his erect penis so far into his victim's empty eye-socket (yes, really) that it actually penetrates his brain. So, if you're curious about 'A Serbian Film,' as I was; or if you're wondering if it's really 'all that bad,' here's your answer: 'A Serbian Film' is not merely just 'as bad' as you might have heard. It is so revolting, so inhumane, and so utterly without merit that the film can serve only as an insult to those of us who believe in both freedom of speech and artistic expression. Indeed, I am thankful this film was not more widely exhibited, because given our current political climate, 'A Serbian Film' would probably be enough to convince a great many people that, if this film is the product of freedoms such as these, we might actually be better off without them.One last thing: please do *not* be deceived (as I was) into thinking that this film has 'a point' that makes it 'worth watching' through to the end – even once – by those critics who have argued that the film is somehow thematically brilliant. Depending on whose review you're reading, this film's brutality is 'excusable' because the filmmakers are working to illustrate either that the Serbian people are 'raped' by the Serbian 'powers that be' from the moment they're born until the moment they die; or, that Serbian film itself is being brutalized by those who purport to love it. Regardless of what these filmmakers might have been *trying* to say, the fact is that they fail miserably, no matter which of these purportedly 'meaningful' readings of the film one tries to impose upon it. Make this a film about the helplessness of the Serbian people, and you somehow have to explain away, among other things, the fact that Milos is not forced against his will into appearing in this 'Serbian film.' Rather, he agrees to appear in the film in exchange for a significant sum of money and remains even after it becomes clear to him that the film will require him to participate in the rape and murder of innocent women and children. For this reason among others, the narrative of the film itself makes this reading of the film impossible to justify.And what of those who've read this film as a commentary on the sad state of Serbian Film itself, which had been heavily censored by the government for years? That's just ridiculous. To protest the censorship of Serbian films by making *this* Serbian film makes about as much sense as protesting gun control legislation by machine-gunning the husbands, wives and children of the people responsible for it. This film does't argue against censorship. It makes a good case *for* censorship.I can only presume that these and other similarly 'meaningful' readings of 'A Serbian Film' are the result of critical attempts to superimpose some kind of 'statement' upon this film that could possibly justify its content. But there is no justification for this film or its content. ""A Serbian Film' is an utterly meaningless anthology of the most savage, inhumane sexual perversions imaginable, strung together via a loosely structured narrative into a 104-minute cinematic assault that serves only to degrade all who watch it – and nothing more.At the conclusion of 'A Serbian Film,' I put my copy of the film where I think it best belonged: in my shredder. And while I am no fan of censorship, if I had the means to do so, I would track down and destroy every copy of this film ever made and then have the people responsible for it arrested and tried for crimes against humanity. Such is the depth of my loathing for both this film and those who made it, and if my words here today do anything at all to prevent the spread of this cinematic virus to even one more person, then as far as I'm concerned, the time I've dedicated to this review will have been very well spent indeed.",A Serbian Film
453,pumbaa-1,"""To je film!""",10,17 September 2013,"One of the most obscene pieces of art I have ever seen, it is persistently trilling and disturbing, actually the feeling of disturbance and uneasiness remains for days The film is horrifying, brutal, sick, perverted, obscene, scandalous. I had to stop for five or six times to shake off of the horror I was experiencing and gather strength to continue. Once I was about to throw up – literally! And after the end I was lying in bed under the cover not moving with my eyes wide open for at least half an hour not being able to sleep out of horror and disgust. The minutes after I woke up I was chased by the dreadful views... This makes it one of my favorite films, it collects all the credits for boldness and bravery, as well as for the talented ability to mess deeply with person's head (and stomach). It's challenging and provocative as true art should be! Aesthetics of the horror and abomination. Nothing reveals in the beginning what is the genre of the film. And if you are unprepared for the content, as I was, the shock is hard to be described. The title ""Serbian film"" spoke to me as an attempt of grotesque approach towards familiar Balkan images and their comic exaggeration. The beginning of the film had an easy-going and comic element so I though- yeah, it's like I've seen it already! The first disturbing scenes are relatively innocent but perpetual gradation of the frightening images follows and doesn't stop until the end. At first you think – ""Waitwhat? Are they really doing it? This is going too far. Come on, there's got to be some limits"" then you settle thinking that the limit has already been crossed. But you do not know yet that further limits are about to be crossed over and over again until you wish you did not belong to the human kind, that you are not the same biological species as the one who created this out of his head. In the end every widely acceptable border is crossed – from necrophilia, through pedophilia to incest and any imaginable kind of socially deviant acts Gathered in one. The ultimate Taboo! A challenge for the viewer. Are you ready to accept what lay in the dark side of us? A brilliant research of the filthy, despicable, repulsive, lusty human nature. The only thing that keeps you sane throughout those two hours is knowing that this is fiction. But in the same time you know also why you feel shame and fear - because somewhere for some people (violators and victims) this is not fiction – this is happening. This makes the film socially engaged by opening the eyes of what our society is hiding behind the facade of social order and progress. Respect for Srdjan Spasojevic!",A Serbian Film

Who wouldn't agree? And who wouldn't be slightly intrigued?Milos, a semi retired porn star is short on cash, he is offered one final job to settle him and his family until the end of his young son's life. The job is a so called art film by a director called Vukmir. He claims to want to not make pornography, but an art film for obviously richer clients to purchase for their personal viewing.The film had a lot of controversy surrounding it from the day it was released for the public to view. This was due to certain scenes shown in the film, including rape, paedophilia, the rape of a newborn baby, fellatio suffocation and varied drug use. All in all, the film is well made, with good acting from all the actors, good camera work, smart scripting, and in some places humorous speech. The thing people cannot agree on is the context of the film. Some say it is a comment on Serbian society, and others just a film created for shocks and the reaction of the audience viewing the film. Halfway, through Vukmir makes a speech, insisting that Serbia as a country is a 'kindergarten' and a 'victim', so to say that the director was simply creating the film for shocks makes me wonder if the people announcing this paid any attention to the film whatsoever. As far as this film goes, it is a brilliant film, and if you can stomach it, definitely something to go and watch.

But once I reached my 20s, I discovered films that triggered a sense of repulsive disgust I would have never previously imagined (Cannibal Holocaust, Salo, The Human Centipede--all of which I wish I had never seen). But A Serbian Film goes way beyond anything horrific I have ever seen. To this day--10+ years later--I am haunted by various scenes, seared into my memory. As a husband and father, these scenes inevitably intrude on moments with my family and spouse that would otherwise be profoundly joyous and pure--corrupting, dirtying, and staining them.Watching this film is willing subjecting yourself to emotional, sexual, and physical abuse. Does that seem hyperbolic? I can tell you it's true. My experience proves it. The scenes in this film made me feel grief, nausea, rage, and revulsion, to name just a few. Other feelings I had aren't ones I can even articulate, like feeling my insides turned into a thousand snakes, coiling, and slapping against each other, driving me to almost shut my eyes in respite. But I didn't. I watched the entire thing. And I wish I never had.If you value your mind or your heart, please don't watch this film. You are subjecting yourself to years of emotional abuse if you do.

On the surface it is just another horror movie with a small twist - it involves a retired adult movie star. But go a few layers beneath and it has got so much human emotions I am actually beginning to feel the director could be the new Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone if he ever got big budgets.The movie is slow paced and you want to know what the lead actor is getting into, just like he wants to know what exactly does he have to do for getting so much money.The real actor in the movie is the guy who plays the adult movie director oh sorry, artiste. He is a very smooth settled man, with a taste for the good things in life and then you slowly realize he is much more insane than anything you ever thought could be.The terror of terrors is the bald man who always wears dark shades. A, he is scary B, he does what is the unthinkable.Pretty gritty and really nasty, the shrieks of a baby getting louder while her mother enjoys the show.And the movie slowly starts its upward journey when the protagonist wakes up in his own house and notices he's been asleep/unconscious for the last 3 days. He starts remembering things in flashes, things which will scare the daylights out of you.From here on, its the protagonist's movie - the way he portrays that raw sexual madness (he is fed bull aphrodisiac!). He looks and behaves like a rabid dog. The movie goes in back and forth motion - he enters a room, looks at the blood stained walls and realizes what he has done. He pukes but its too late for forgiveness. He bites his hand in the futile hope that this was all a bad dream. Then he gets his hands on a set of tapes - tapes that would bring back all that happened in those 3 days.The whole scene where the family of the protagonist finally decides to end their suffering and embraces each other one last time before taking the plunge is gut wrenching to say the least.And at the end of it all...""start with the little one...""",A Serbian Film

While, yes, there is a massive amount of gore and there are themes dealt with of a very intense nature, it's much more accurate to call this a thriller or perhaps a very dark drama. There are few movies I have seen that have received a near-global ""banning"" where I could actually understand a regional government's reasoning behind it. In fact, this may be the first. That being said, when I sat down to finally view the much-hyped ""Serbian Film,"" I had to do it properly: with the uncut 104 minute version.I may be a rare exception with this film, but there was not a single scene that made me flinch. But... I have a background in psychology and the study of abnormal sexual deviancy; I can justify anyone's sexual fetish and usually provide a clinical reason why they are the way they are without batting an eyelash. But I'm well-aware most people do not have an understanding of human nature to that degree, and your average person is going to find this movie soul-crushingly offensive and, quite possibly, unable to watch in it's entirety. The movie relies on its ability to shock you, and it is within that shock that it attempts to provide twists and turns and leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. If you're not caught in the tragedy of it all, you will probably find the film terribly predictable as I did. However, the creativity of the gore involved, the scenarios that are created and the scenes that most people aren't expecting warrants it a decent rating, at least on here.I would never tell someone not to watch, read or listen to anything... but you cannot unsee this movie.",A Serbian Film
462,luckylibralady,The Clue is in the Very Ending,5,25 May 2012,"I watched A Serbian Film out of curisoity and I wish I had never seen that infamous scene with the NewBorn baby rape, but I have a feeling this is based on a True Story where things like this happen. I was haunted by the screams of that newborn baby but the behaviour of that mother was unbelievable but it led me to believe that this character is based on a true life character who could be used as a brood mare for the vile bastards in the most extreme, inhuman and terrible section of the child porn industry. Maybe she was smiling cos she was giving a large amount of money (remember Serbia is not very rich and the atmosphere is brutal thanks to that big war in the 90's)to sacrifice her child in this terrible manner and as for the driver called Rasa, he is a Monster out and out. The actor who played him must be very, very brave man but my out and out view of this film was that it was well made, well directed and well acted. Even though Milos is part of the porn industry, he is not completely portrayed as a braindead meathead but a family man who the audience will feel empathy for and the wife character was nicely acted too. In fact, all the characters of the film were believable but the best acted was Vulmir who did not overact his insanity. It looks as if the Serbians have shown the big wigs in Hollywood how a really controversial film is created and also how people can really think after watching a film. The very last bit of the film is probably the screenwriter telling the audience all this story is actually true and the very last characters must of been portraying those people without naming names, think about that. Anyway I gave this film a half/half rating because it was disgusting to portray children in a unnatural way and also it showed many a vile thing and suggestion, like necrophilia, animal sex and so on but the good things with the film is that it made people become aware that there is real evil in this world.

463,sickofitall58,This movie....,4,21 June 2012,"I watched this film a few months ago and the one thing I remember about my experience was laughing hysterically at the movie; it's that bad. The extreme violence and deprave acts committed have no point at all. They are so over the top and stupid that you can't help but laugh. Take for instance the part where Milos is raping his son. Enter scene! Milos is drugged up and raping a small child among others. It's graphic and bloody. Who would it happen to be? His son! Of course it's his son. Why the hell not.Another problem I have is the script. It's for lack of a better word ""retarded"". The whole anecdote about the horny goats and bloody goat sperm used as a spread on bread is perhaps one of the greatest bad lines of all cinema. Followed by the classic line ""You are my he-goat"", trust me folks, this isn't half as bad as it gets. I think perhaps the best line of the film is after Milos is shown a film of a man raping a child. The director yells ""New born porn! New genre!"". Unbelievable. I gave up on this movie having any quality after that scene.In closing, this movie is dumb. The entire thing is such a screw you to movies of the same genre that have meaning and depth beyond the sickening violence. Others might argue that it's an artistic statement against the tyranny of the Serbian government. It's not. If you want art, watch Passolini's Salo. If you want to watch a man rape a bunch of people for no reason then watch this film. The 4 is for the cinematography. The only positive thing about this dreadful movie.",A Serbian Film

I didn't even think I could make it to the end of the movie. Now, as per my summary, I'm one of those people who gets pumped watching movies like Saw, Hostel, House of 1000 Corpses, etc. I live for extremes, but like I said, this movie goes far beyond that.

You find it in top 10s of disturbing movies and it is widely credited as one of the most horrific movies in modern film.I liked it.I've recently been on a quest to find the most disturbing movie ever made, and although this film does not quite achieve that for me, it's certainly not family friendly. The premise is not entirely original but it promises to be what it says on the tin - a straight up gore porn thriller aimed to feature the worst taboos and manners of perversion imaginable.The plot is fairly simple - Milo, a retired porn star, agrees to do one last job to earn enough money for his wife and son to live in comfort but he doesn't read the terms and conditions. The movie quickly escalates into sexual violence and horror as Milo's new director creates new ground-breaking 'art'.The film is effective because although the gore is explicit and gratuitous it doesn't detract from the plot. The horror is more at what is happening than watching it happen. I'm not a guy so I imagine I don't fully understand how uncomfortable it is to see a knife held against your privates but I know that none of the gore made me feel disgusted - just uncomfortable. The first 30 minutes of the film are fairly tame and uneventful but after an hour we start to see the viciousness of this film.After that there's no rest in the action and it is all leading towards the ending. I won't spoil it but I will say that it is more horrific than anything we have seen in the film so far - and that includes 'newborn porn'.Overall I think the film works so well because of the characters. The film compels you to like Milo so early that no matter what he does we always feel sorry for him most of all. His character is surprisingly moral and as such easy to empathise with and I found Srdjan Todorovic's performance excellent.I also think the score deserves a mention. The soundtrack was done by Wikluh Sky and it was gritty and intense in all the right ways to build up the tension. Very Heavy on the bass but memorable and iconic.The cinematography and tone of the film was everything you'd expect - dark and gritty and somehow quite artistic. It's a film that takes itself quite seriously but I think Srđan Spasojević' did an excellent job on his first feature length film.In conclusion - good film, great ending, not for the faint hearted.I's only recommend it to those with a strong stomach and a thirst for the disturbing but I would definitely recommend it.",A Serbian Film
466,kdpba,To the 9th degree,8,21 April 2014,"I am going to keep this one very short. So for an artist of any type, is there morality. Is lack of morality considered part of art? Is creation of art about the lack of morality art? Is it opinion. I will pull no punches here. This film is about as sick and twisted as one can possibly get. The acting is actually good in my honest opinion. The plot, the storyline and all that is associated with it are actually creative and border on brilliance. The way the film uses the flow of time and we as 3rd persons follow the character back through what he forgot is a bit of trickery for those not expecting the horrors that lay ahead of them. I watched the uncut version of this film. I thought the scenes were well shot. Though the budget was tight and the film used the Red One Camera and later converted to 35mm , with much controversy I might add, I think the visuals give an almost black and white feel which is fitting. For those whining and complaining in disgust, I understand. I have a child and I was abused as a child. I can understand the parental response in all of us when faced with such graphic scenes. Then again I have seen some pretty sick films. Pulp Fiction and Scarface have their own set of horrors. The genius in this film is it takes it to the ultimate level. Actually it didn't because the scene that was requested within the film never happened. Instead we we ended up with a nightmare filled twist of fate. Some of the scenes were just over the top however. The props used were likely toned down to look fake. They had a bit of a low budget quality. The scenes that probably bother people the most are the birthing scene, which is 100% fake and the child rape scene which is simulated , the actor was not even there. The ending is probably the most horrible part of the entire film as even in death , the chain of abuse and sickness goes on.If you have not seen this film and you are not mentally stable, or have emotional or sexual issues I would strongly recommend you not watch it. A majority of those that have seen it have said never again. Even film critics that gave it some good marks, said they would never watch it again. Maybe that is the point.Just because you can do something as art should you? There has been and still is a lot of fall out because of this film. I will say this. We are all human. Don't think for one moment that None of you are NOT capable of any of the horrors in the film, you are. I will not argue on that point because it is out right fact. Given the correct set of circumstances this horror exists in us all. We are capable of all of these nightmares. Lucky for us, the majority hold a great deal of morality and faith in all that is good.If you so choose to watch this I would ONLY recommend the uncut version, which by the way is not legal in all countries.The point may very well be that given the right circumstances there are those around us that very well could fall into such a hell. That may be the most important thing you can take away from this movie.",A Serbian Film
467,lhrubino,A Daring Horror Movie,6,24 April 2014,"After watching ""A Serbian Film"" for the first time I came to the realization that horror and your run-of-the-mil shocker are clearly two separate things. Well produced, with good acting and an outstanding atmosphere, ""A Serbian Film"" offers the viewer scenes that'll get him reaching for the remote due to sheer horror.If you collect controversy, this is a must-see, interesting, and very daring. Pasolini's similarly disturbing Salò bemoaned the manner in which fascism cultivates a world with two classes and no exploitative limits; one suspects from the title that A Serbian Film's raucousness is meant to be taken as an analogous socio-political salvo. But aside from a sputtering monologue comparing Serbia's masses to raped, dithering orphans, writer-director Srđan Spasojević's content flowers with mostly psychological resonance; his film is better than the nationalist lividness that may have been its impetus.",A Serbian Film
468,Chilipi,Its hard to judge,8,8 September 2012,"You can hate it or love it, but you can't deny that it is a pretty disturbing film, and that's exactly what Spasojevic wanted to make.It's important to view films in their context, and in this case, it's within the troubled country of Serbia and the corrupted authorities that rule it. It's easy to see what Spasojevic meant when he said ""This is a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government. We're giving this back to you"". When you being to break down the characters, and see what each represent, you can definitely see that this film is an intense allegorical exploration of the turmoil, for what I would assume, had been felt the Serbians in the face of oppression.Now this is a shock film, and that is extremely significant. I am quite in tune with the art world, and for us, in shock performances, the art is embedded in the interaction of audience and the artist. Take an artist called Mike Parr, in a certain performance on stage, whilst talking to an audience, he suddenly takes out an axe and begins madly hacking at his arm. Unbeknownst to the audience it was a prosthetic arm stuffed with minced meat and fake blood. Shock elements are repulsive at first, but are done to convey the most animal of instinct. Fear and disgust. And that is the fundamental emotions that the Spasojevic wanted to convey. It's interesting because Spasojevic conveys this shock, through what this film depicts, except, it doesn't really depict it. I mean, as far as what this film depicts, the level of gore and sex, is on par with many horror films. It's what the film implies that it's depicting that is completely terrifying. It's actually pretty amazing that this entire film manages to almost show nothing, yet conveys everything. Let's face it, in 104 minutes of a characters having sex, there was not a single pornographic scene, and those two infamous scenes with the children? You knew what was happening, but you didn't actually see any of it happen on screen. What I'm trying to say is, this film, is definitely not just some director recreating his fetishes, it's trying to send a message.Now the hard part, is giving this film an actual rating. It's ironic that some people voted it less than 3 because of how disgusting it is, because that disgust, is what makes this film, more than just a snuff film. The music was good, and the cinematography was very well done. Actors, I thought were adequate (I'm not in a position to make definite judgments on foreign actors), but Srdjan Todorovic (Milos) reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson in 'the Shining' at some points. The film is pretty well made and my point is, it doesn't deserve anything less than a 5, especially if it's just because it made you want to throw up. Though IMDb community is pretty good with this anyway.So is this a masterpiece? People hated clockwork orange at the time of its release, but over time, we have begun appreciate, and eventually, set it to a classic status. Now look at Oldboy, I actually find the ambiance of both films as really similar. The difference, I would say is the approach of both directors. Now if Spasojevic were to have made this more about the psychology of Milos, Serbian Film would have been Oldboy's other half and I bet you this film would have been loved by so many more people. This film could have been a theatrical hit in that sense, a gripping tale of raw destruction, revealing the darkest depths of the human condition. It would have been an amazing film, but that's just it, it would have only have been a film.If Spasojevic wanted to tell an amazing story, perhaps he would have approached it that way. Or maybe, just maybe, his trying to create for something more.Not a film, but an experience, not just a story, but an emotional response. People tend not to care about anything unless it directly affects them, and just because it's a good film, doesn't mean it can convey meaning better than a mediocre film, it just means it was a better watching experience. Perhaps making it a great film, would have taken away from the sheer horror it conveys as it is. It's hard to judge because we have so little experience with horrific shock films before. Even if you were so repulsed by the movie you turned it off halfway and voted it a 1, it did its job, and perhaps you took more away from those 50 minutes, than a 100 minute watered down Hollywood version of the film could ever have. As I've said repeatedly now, it's about the shock value and the message. As a film, I would say, it's a very hazy, 7-8, but it is so hard to tell, because this film, isn't even about the film, it's about the audience's reaction to the film. As it is now, if I had to say, I would say that it's a pretty decent movie, but it's different. Maybe one day, when most of society can watch this with an open mind, when we can truly understand what the director is trying to convey, and see this film as an Avante Garde of a new style/generation of film, it will be propelled to a legendary status, side by side with Clockwork orange. Or maybe that's just too optimistic.In the end it's not a film you watch to be entertained, it's not a Hollywood film and therefore shouldn't be judged as one. It really is more like an art film, and reminds me of the videos in contemporary art galleries. It's an art film, revoltingly uncomfortable and disturbing, and that's why it's hard to judge",A Serbian Film

Movies like The Hangover have never been able to get this kind of story down-pat, but A Serbian Film nails it. I hate even the thought of pornography. It disgusts me, but believe me when i tell you that that's not what this is about. I can't tell you what that is without spoiling the ending, but let's just say, it is horrific. The final saga of the movie contains some of the most shocking twists that i've seen in a movie in a while.

It depicts the shadier side of the pornography industry, and by shadier, I mean gruesome and disturbing. Personally, I enjoyed the film, despite the intense and often upsetting content. As a native English speaker, I had to watch with closed captions, but, honestly, the movie was so captivating that having to read subtitles didn't bother me at all. I completely understand how some countries have banned this film; it depicts violent pornography, rape, snuff, and strongly alludes to pedophilia on several occasions, including a profoundly disturbing portion involving a baby, however nothing was actually shown. Although the movie is very upsetting and disturbing, and I truly think that it is a good film and it shows the darker, more malevolent side of humans, and exposes the sinister side of the pornography industry that appeals to certain fetishes. It's a good reminder that things that despicable actually happen in the world.Great movie. Terrible subject matter.",A Serbian Film

473,clubbangerhouse,What it is actually about,7,9 June 2013,"A definitely hard-to watch film - had to switch off the sound and look away and fast-forward many times. Guess, only maniacs would watch this without blinking eye. Nevertheless, the mad violence and shocking scenes are there for a reason, unlike the torture porn and trash films. The themes explored are Corruption of Serbian Government, Women and Child abuse, oppression and exploitation of the Serbian people by their rich elite, and not only in Serbia or former Yugoslav republic, but throughout the whole Eastern Europe, including Russia. You may object, and say that I try to see things, when there is none, and all of this are just excuses of this film-makers. However, many Eastern Europeans would feel the same about it. And for Westerners this might be harder to understand, as they do not live in such problematic conditions as we do and have not experienced recently major problems as we had, (at least of such a kind). The authors by shocking the viewer wanted to show the actuality of a problem, that there should not be calmness and looking at it ""through ones fingers"". People tend to get accustomed to safety and hide from disturbance. First, so much ""fucking"" in the film conveys the exploitation of everyone, everywhere and everything. People are shown worse than any animals. Baby scene - probably the hardest - portrays how you get exploited straight from when you are born. Torturing and exploitation of women, raping children - this is what actually a major catastrophe in Eastern Europe, not without the involvement of the nation's elite class.The dark side of the porn is shown - the sexual exploitation of penniless Eastern European women, and population, where women are put in such position that it is the only way out to survive. Don't you know that most porn and prostitution comes from Eastern Europe? And where does it get most funding from? Very few women would turn to such occupation, unless it's the only way for survival.Corruption of the police and, in general, of relationships between humans is strongly portrayed through the Milos's brother. Interesting fact was that film-makers managed to shoot the film without any funding from their government, when all other films would. This movie has an impression of the anger at the Government and the current situation not only in Serbia, but in all of the E. European region.I liked this film, but would never watch it again.",A Serbian Film

Sure, Irreversible, In a Glass Cage, Men Behind the Sun, and Cannibal Holocaust had their moments but nothing ever raised the bar for me.

There's almost a sense of bragging rites that come with being able watch this film the whole way through. By the time it was over, I simply stared at the screen, unable to process what I witnessed. A Serbian Film is, by all accounts, disgusting. Bad things happen to good people. It's purposefully designed to take all the fond feelings we have seeing Milos and his family living a relatively normal and happy life, and have those fond feelings raped in front of our eyes. That's the simultaneous genius and horror of A Serbian Film. The reason the acts of violence we see are so powerful, besides the acts themselves being horrendous, is that it's happening to a family we've taken time, if only twenty or so minutes. We see this very reaction from Milos himself, when he sees the videos of what he had done, he's horrified because it's him; because it's people he knows. It's the same with us watching. We have to watch as the young son who we saw innocently playing in the park is raped by his own father. We have to see a poor battered woman, who we can tell doesn't want to be part of Vukmir's movie is just as lost as Milos, get her head chopped off mid-coitus. And of course let's not forget, ""Newborn porn!"" Which is horrifying on principle. But despite the film doing fairly well in getting us invested, that's precisely the reason it's so awful. We're watching terrible things happen to characters we care about, and without any real resolution. The movie ends with the family emotionally and psychologically destroyed. It's the cinematic equivalent to being tied to a chair while four masked men are screwing your girlfriend in front of you. There's just no way to make it entertaining. All it does is hurt.The three stars I do give are for the actual production. The film itself is very well made, with cinematography that is unheard of when it comes to this kind of movie.

483,ryanwelsh2132,A film which you should have no knowledge of going in... but good god... life? What life?,7,11 April 2013,"Heed this warning. If you are serious about viewing the ultimate extreme in cinema, you have found it. However, you should stop reading here. If you are dedicated enough, you should have no knowledge of the horrors that you will soon witness. However, if you, like many others, have watched it, and are now looking for some explanation, here it goes...A Serbian Film is a tour de force experiment in what cinematography is, as well as what it can be. Technically A Serbian Film is about as impressive as can be. Camera work is absolutely stunning. The use of filters is masterful, and it really portrays the feeling of hopelessness that this film is meant to leave you with. Hopelessness that we feel right alongside the protagonist, Milos. Milos is a retired pornography actor, renowned in his trade. However, upon falling in love and having a child, Milos has fallen away from his previous lifestyle. The hardest adjustment is the lack of income. Thus, in order to support his family, Milos accepts one final job... Problem being that his employer, Vukmir, will not allow him any knowledge of the filth he will be shooting. And it is just that, filth. Some of the acts portrayed in A Serbian Film are so graphic and disturbing that you will regret having seen them. The nonstop sex and violence is really just a vehicle, though, for a much larger meaning. Milos is conned, using the promise of riches, into falling into a trap set by those with far more power than himself. Sex is the ultimate exploitation. A Serbian Film shows the direct parallels between sexual exploitation and violent exploitation. The entire film is a metaphor. Milos is brought to his downfall because he was a pawn of Vukmir, and Vukmir is brought to his downfall because he was a pawn of a far greater power. Each exploiting the inhumanity of the next. The sex and violence driven trap that Milos falls into for money sees everything that he cared about ripped away from him by his own hand. The madness that he feels is the madness that the viewer feels. Milos is a victim, and we are made to feel as violated as he does.

You see I am already pretty crazy and have seen some very disturbing things, but this is on a whole new level..Considering the nature it SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED BY ANYONE.That being said, it is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen, surprisingly it isn't focused on just the grotesqueness but that is all you will ever hear about elsewhere.The director contrasts beautiful scenic, iconic if you will locations with sudden dark scenes, if you are like me and like how directors use colour contrast to display subliminal emotions and messages, this is f***ing flawless.Keeping it short, I don't condone these types of films but if you are ready, you won't be disappointed.",A Serbian Film
489,hkmsimmons,Cheap shot shocks make for a substance-free mess.,1,19 December 2013,"Milos, a retired porn star, leads a normal family life with his wife Maria and six-year old son Petar in tumultuous Serbia, trying to make ends meet. A sudden call from his former colleague Layla will change everything. Aware of his financial problems, Layla introduces Milos to Vukmir - a mysterious, menacing and politically powerful figure in the pornographic business. A leading role in Vukmir's production will provide financial support to Milos and his family for the rest of their lives. A contract insists on his absolute unawareness of a script they will shoot. From then on, Milos is drawn into a maelstrom of unbelievable cruelty and mayhem devised by his employer, ""the director"" of his destiny. Vukmir and his cohorts will stop at nothing to complete his vision. In order to escape the living cinematic hell he's put into, and save his family's life, Milos will have to sacrifice everything - his pride, his morality, his sanity, and maybe even his own life. - (C) Invincible PicturesAs suggested by the title, Srdjan Spasojevic's' 'A Serbian Film' is an illuminated, ithyphallic allegory representative of a country bestialised, raped, pillaged, commodified and sold- by it's very inhabitants- down the drain.Whilst I understand that this is the metaphorical portrayal being made, the film itself delivers something without substance. In fact, what is delivered on face value is horrifying and uncomfortable to observe. Milos is stagnant as a role. Just as well as I fear any further involvement in the general narrative would choke the actor's ability to find work elsewhere upon it's release. This film uses the abhorrent metaphor of the 'taboo pornography' as indicative of Serbia's rotting morality as a state. Of course, whilst that symbolism is poetic and enchanting, when this is mirrored in the presentation of 'newborn porn' it cannot be justified. Similarly, imagery used to affiliate children with sexual intercourse, irrespective of metaphor or not, encourages a fragmented and inappropriate deliverance. Pseudo-intellectual rubbish at it's very worst.I understand controversy. I encourage risk in filmmaking and understand that, in taking a risk, you can immerse yourself into a world of sheer cinematic fury. A fight that no one wins but the involvement is thrill enough. 'A Serbian Film' does not portray this. In fact, it can only be described as truly repulsive.This film is full of horrendous shock tactics, cheap shots at gut- wrenching repulsion. Admittedly, if you have a stronger will to justify illusions to child pornography then you may extract something far more developed than I can. However, I believe that controversy is exciting but throwing horrendous imagery upon the screen that involves the drugged rape of your child is not metaphorical. It is not controversial. It is intolerantly unpleasant with zero meaning.",A Serbian Film

491,wismaad-7,A retired porn star is asked to work with an insane self-proclaimed 'artistic' director whose notions of pornographic art will make his skin crawl,10,19 November 2014,"A Serbian Film is a masterpiece! I have not, till date, seen a movie as twisted and as shocking as this one. It took me a couple of days to actually get over how awesome it was. It left a lasting impression and it has been, by far, one of the best films I have seen. don't even try watching this movie while eating something or you'll be running to the bathroom to puke it out. Yes, it's that gory. But definitely worth it. I have a habit of chit chatting in between movies and constantly making comments. However, this one made me go mum. The acting of all characters in this movie is commendable! A porn star is asked to shoot one final film to financially secure his family's future. What he does not realise is that the director has plans of his own. He doesn't give him a script or ideas about what he will be shooting. What materialises further on will give you goosebumps and make your stomach churn. But after watching this movie, you would wish that you could magically acquire the ability to erase your memory so that you could watch the movie again. A must-watch!",A Serbian Film
492,SwitchyWaggles,This is pathetic.,1,11 February 2014,"This film goes for shock factor. It's story line is dry and nothing exciting, it doesn't bring anything new. The scenes in it are ridiculous, after 30 minutes into the film I couldn't take it seriously, it introduced sex provoking drugs that seemed to turn our lead character into a rabid, raping, machete wielding maniac. There's no character building, I literally didn't sympathize or feel any sort of emotion towards the end of the film, apart from confusion and of course shock, the closest we get to character building is a 7 minute montage of porn movies at the beginning of the film . The character at the end who is there performing rape on Milos' wife is in barely any scenes and one of the scenes he is in, is him jerking off into a sink? I don't know if that's suppose to be character building or what!? The hype and controversy around this film was way too high. That's all the film seems to be good at though; being controversial. It had 'new born porn' and murder and rape. We witness Milos get raped by a guard at one point, what happened to that guard? The film might as well be a low quality video of a new born baby being raped, then a bright flashy sign saying ""PAY ATTENTION TO ME!"". At one point in the film, Milos kills a man with his penis, by forcing it down the scarred eye of that guy that appears half way through the movie without any intro, who also snaps two extra's necks. You know, the character with the cool shades, the one that does literally nothing, other than have his brain poked with genitalia!? I couldn't be more disappointed with a film if I tried. I think 'The Room' has a better story line and character building than this, it was also controversial for all the right reasons. In all honesty yes I was shocked, but it wasn't because I witnessed a newborn being raped, or a woman being decapitated, or because a child is raped then murdered. It's because whoever wrote the film thought it was a good idea.",A Serbian Film

494,sriram1,Subtle Shock at the right moments - Be Prepared,9,14 September 2014,"This is my first comment in IMDb, in fact first comment of mine about movies ever of any sort. But after watching this film continuously twice in the same session I decided to pen my feelings down. I am not going to reveal anything that would take away the suspense when you watch the movie. Is this a disturbing movie? Yes. Very much at times. Is this a disgusting movie? May be for average viewers. I have watched even more disgusting movies. But don't underestimate this one. It has some good graphics that makes it both disturbing and disgusting.Is there love in the movie? Yes. Love of Husband and wife and Father and Son is shown. And that develops the plot.Is the movie sexually arousing? One scene and thats all. Rest are turn offs. Is this an Art film? Are you joking? Only if you call any unconventional film an art film.Can i digest this movie? Depends on your sensitivity. If you are that kind of a viewer who gets moved emotionally by seeing someone humiliated on screen, breaks up with his love etc - for GOD's sake don't ever attempt to watch this movie. You cannot digest it even after years.What is so great about this movie? Why cant we just treat it as a sexually explicit material? The director has given the movie a documentary touch by claiming that the film depicts the way the Serbian government treats its nationals. Though the movie deals with Sex, its carefully woven into the plot. However the director has fantasized it a bit too much is what i feel. The Acting is good - especially of the protagonist and his lead. The Screenplay and cinematography adds mystery and tension. Will this movie cater to the needs of a Horror fan? The film has some element of Horror. But not to the levels to cater to a Horror film fan. If i had been the director, i would have modified more than 30 - 40 minutes of the movie to add more horror.How's this Film when compared to some toppers in 'Most Disturbing Films' ever made. This film has torture, this film has horror, this film has betrayal, this film has sex, this film has murder, this film has story, this film has love, this film has affection. This film has borrowed elements from all facets of life. This is missing in the other movies in the list. Two things happen for everyone who watches this movie. 1) You begin to step into the hero's shoes and think what will you do at his position 2) You will get blanked out as if that - what you are seeing, has happened to you. Either way, the film is a success and hence the rating.Can I watch this with my family? NO. Unless you want them to spit on your face for showing them this one.Will I watch this film again? Yes. Definitely. When I am extremely happy or extremely sad, i will watch this movie again and again. You think I am a psycho? NO. I am a normal person.",A Serbian Film
495,bboysmile999,Not what you might expect,8,15 May 2021,"So to be honest: My friends recommended me this movie since I see myself as a heavy-weight champion in not being affected by thriller/horror. As they described the movie they hyped it up to be one of the most vile movies ever created. I was excited to be filled with the adrenaline of being truly horrified, and I kind of was - to a certain degree.If you view the movie as it is, it is a pretty outstanding social commentary on how messed up the world is and it does so at a masterful level. The movie has some VERY disturbing scenes. But it was not even close to as bad as I expected it to be. MOST viewers will probably be scarred for life after watching this, and for those viewers my recommendation is: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE DISTURBED BY SEXUAL VIOLENCE, MURDER, NECROPHILIA AND PEDOPHILIA.The movie is an easy 8/10. Good movie, great main actor. It is an absurd and bizarre movie for sure, but still not as bad as some of the other movies I've seen during my years as a connoisseur of truly disturbing movies.If you have the balls to actually sit through the whole movie without stopping, good on you - BUT DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This movie is a masterpiece, the way this film is made is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and it emphasizes the terror in the movie so well it's almost hard to believe. Don't get me wrong, this is probably the most disturbing thing you will ever see and I don't recommend it to people who are not horror fans, but the worst kind of horror, the human, realistic kind.

I've seen far more disturbing movies in my opinion, and many movies that slapped things together to make them shocking just because. If you're a sensitive person, avoid this movie at all costs.

499,Bigrich693,Shock value at it's best.,1,29 September 2011,"Being the thrill and shock seeker that I am, I came across ""A Serbian Film"". After watching a ton of shock and gore movies, i was still looking for something more. And after reading so many contrasting reviews, I had to check this out for myself. What I should mention is that if you have a soft stomach or are sensitive to rape ( adult and child) you have no place watching this film. Stay as far away as possible. Now I have seem many unimaginable things in life and through film but this one take things to the next level. Newborn porn?? WTF is that?? An unintentional family orgy (brother with wife, father with son). SEX with a headless woman??? who in thief right mind can think of this ( the latter actually made me chuckle a bit)? The sick side of me appreciated the movie for it's attempt to scar the individual. there is blood everywhere, rape everywhere, murder. Everything we could imagine hell to be is depicted in this movie and the thrill i was seeking, the way I wanted to be shocked, was definitely all there. The human side of me withered into a corner wanting to run as far away from this movie as possible. Now I'm a tough SOB and i have a hard stomach for things but There is no doubt I will never be able to forget the scenes in this film and now I feel like in a way, The little bit on innocence I had left has been ripped away from me.It takes a special kind of individual to watch a movie like this. Truthfully, we all watched it because of our subconscious blood thirsty desire to be effected. The director did just that, and succeeded. I will try to forget about this movie for i feel like my brain was molested. It opened my eyes to even more depravity in this world. It saddens me to think that this could be real life, that this could happen to an innocent child. With that said, I can definitely understand why some people can view this as art, and why some think it should never be showed again. It's definitely something like you have never seen before. Just keep in mind, if u decide to journey in to this mind F**k, be prepared to never be the same. I don't care how many horror movies you have seen, this will top the cake, relatively. One film professor always told us that if u want to evoke compassion, hurt a child or a dog on your film. I think that was taken to the next level. Goodluck!",A Serbian Film
500,jennstowers,I will never be able to understand this movie....unfortunately..,1,5 September 2015,"OK first off the one and perhaps the only positive thing I can say about this film is it was very well made. I could have tolerated this film if it did NOT include two scenes. I have seen a lot of messed up..f**ked up movies. Also a lot of messed up things in my real life. I love horror and have a strong stomach ...as well as not being easy disturbed. I'm sure this movie has messed me up for life! I literally felt nauseated,depressed and angry all at once over those two scenes in the movie. ( the baby being born and the ending with the son) I could have went the rest of my life without seeing it. Though it is a reminder of why I hate so much of humanity and don't trust anyone. Even a good friend (who has about the same fondness for the f**ked up.and not easily disturbed) was angered and sicked out by this film. As well as my boyfriend and bro and law. It just takes it too far. Another friend had to leave the room. And I'm not buying the whole ""political"" bs. It is just a sickly perverse movie. I'm all down for gore, cannabism,death, torture, what ever. But the pedo crap was disgusting. Anyone who could watch that crap and feel OK with it or not be messed up from..angry..sick..etc needs to be tortured until death. It really was that bad.

502,harrytheref,Nasty Film but more crucially lacking meaning,3,30 October 2015,"The barometer of films of such depravity, although I would hasten to add Spasojevi? has surpassed anything put in a cinema before, is it's meaning. The comparison between 'A Serbian Film' and Deodato's 'Cannibal Holocaust 'from 1980, is on the surface obvious and easy. Without comparing the violence between the two much, they have, seemingly anyway, barbaric scenes intended to shock. Of course Deodato's animal slaughter created this, but intrinsically there was a pretty clear meaning in his film, and while of course some just brand it on what they see on the surface, quite understandably, as sadistic fuel for people with psychopathic tendencies; however, it's message was pretty clear and you almost felt empathy for cumulatively victorious Cannibals. This could not be further from the truth for 'A Serbian Film'. The alarm bells started ringing for me, when my mentally troubled friend who has openly declared to having great fantasies to sadistically murder, ceased watching after 1 minute. Admittedly more for it's unrestrained approach to sex, so as to main character Milos' child watching on old porn tape his dad filmed he found on the DVD rack. I think one moment stays with me, notwithstanding the mentally challenging violence, is the contrast of comparative happiness when Milos decides to kill himself, and his probably yet further traumatized family, who have been raped and tortured by Milos and his, odd to say the least, brother Marko. After this it becomes apparent they will feature in a necrophilic pornography shoot, as a gentleman unzips his trousers to the solemn statement of 'the little one first'. The fact that Spasojevi? ruthlessly removes any hint of contentment at the films conclusion is quite symbolic in my opinion, in that it leaves on a yet worse taste in the mouth from the deeply challenging hour and a half that precedes it, as I'm sure one American reviewer would also agree as he fainted at one screening whilst making an attempt to leave. The only message it conveys for me is certainly not one Spasojevi? would have hoped for. It just makes anyone at all involved making the film look immoral, yet further desperate, and while part of us hates them for creating such a piece of 'art' that doesn't befit description, to the very true reality of desperation and desolation, a situation identical to that of Milos and his wife. Why would anyone want to work an a film of such horror, the actress who is beheaded, the mother who allowed a child no older than eight star in a film where he is 'raped', surely they'd be there only for it's monetary gain. As for Spasojevi?, he appears just like Vukmir, a man desperate to feed a fascination for ever worsening aridity, dealing in exploitation of people, maybe even like Milos who didn't appreciate the sheer horror of what he was going to partake in. As returning for my original point of purpose, perhaps it only really serves to show people who are aroused by such evil seek help as soon as possible. Surely most worrying though for the film sector, is if someone tries to 'better' such a film of almost insulting degeneracy.",A Serbian Film
503,lmonkey-95049,Disturbing and hard to watch (Very),5,8 November 2015,"(warning) I came across this movie online. I had never heard of this film before, neither had I heard of the maker. I will not be watching it again, but not for the reasons people would think, bad script, poor acting, badly shot and confusing directions...no, these were good, brilliant even. No, it is because I can guarantee, it will disturb you.The film starts off about a retired porn actor who has taken a back seat from his occupation to concentrate on his family life, until an old acquaintance tells him of a job offer from an apparent ""Artist"" film maker. He is offered a large sum of money, although this figure is never revealed throughout the film, nor is he told what is required of him. He accepts the offer because from his perspective his current financial position is much to be desired.After a confusing couple of days he becomes uneasy after being hoodwinked into engaging in violent sexual acts particularly in front of a young girl who is underage. he meets up with the producer to refuse any more work, THEN the producer/ director reveals a movie made by the company showing a man raping a newborn baby. As you can imagine I ragged the hard drive out of the T.V and deleted it, the girlfriend was clearly distraught and after much deliberation and calming down I recollected the data and went past that harrowing scene. Unfortunately the movie just keeps getting worse with a particular graphic scene of the drugged main character raping a woman who is headless and raping his own young son and more.I suggest if you are easily disturbed, it is best you leave this piece well alone because it could easily traumatize you.(you have been warned).",A Serbian Film

Be it in acting, cinematography, music, dialogue, visual effects and the narration. Production quality is very good.I like the way the story was narrated by establishing each and every character by taking time and by slowly increasing the tempo and The way the story moves forward from the perspective of the main character Milos. There is one important scene from this movie perspective which actually plays a role where Milos is giving reaction similar to the viewers. The following movie sequences make some sense as both the audience and Milos are following about what happened to him at the same time.I also read somewhere that from Director's perspective the story and certain scenes are related to the metaphor with respect to the way Serbian Government was managing or doing after the Yugoslav wars in 1990's. The story can take place anywhere and the events are closer to reality as it might have happened somewhere in this world. I appreciate the films from the European/Korean/Japanese movie industry in general as there is no compromises or facade in expressing certain topics or contents which movie's from other places won't do.In short, its a well made film without any compromises along with heavy content which might not suit all the viewers.Rating: 10/10",A Serbian Film
507,phillipsaaron,A possible artistic masterpiece or a snuff film,8,9 February 2016,"While my rating for ""A Serbian Film"" is fairly high, I had to look past the gruesome scenes and see the meaning of the film. There are many films of the shock genre that have meaning and purpose and are well admired by critics and movie lovers alike. From Lars Von Triers ""Antichrist,"" to Gasper Noe ""Irreversible,"" they're beautiful masterpiece made to make us think, to make us enjoy cinema, and made to shock us. But one must ask; is the shocks in ""A Serbian Film,"" too much? While the director states that the movie is made to show the downright torture the citizens of Serbia felt from a cruel government, very similar to what the main character, Milos, is subjected to by an entrepreneur named Vukmir, the film has some of the most vile and shocking scenes that would make the Devil blush. Everything from pedophilia, rape, murder, incest, and many other atrocities that Milos is drugged into, one must ask is the film too shocking for its purpose, despite being well made and well acted? The film is about an aging porn star, Milos, who is know for his style and for his endurance and long member. But, struggling with finances, Milos look for jobs to pay the bills until one day he is contacted by a man named Vukmir Vukmir, an incredibly wealthy man who is quite a big fan of Milos. He considers Milos' films to not be pornographic, but art. From the rhythm to the endurance to please his partner(s), Milos is considered a master of his craft. Which leads to a contract that Vukmir convinces Milos to not read and just signs the deal. The only info Milos has about the deal is the money, which is incredibly high, and to wait for a BMW car to pick him up to goto the location of filming despite not knowing what he is shooting. The film uses the old cliché of stories and movies where the main character is in need of helps and gets offered a deal too good to be true. And just like Milos, the character always realized when it's too late to save himself.The movie goes on with Milos trying to reconcile what has happens and through memories coming back and through watching some of the videos he filmed, he discovers that he is drugged into doing things completely unimaginable to him and downright disturbing. As a newcomer and fan to the shock genre of film, I thought I could handle the film. Its been pretty hyped up like most films of the genre, but I was unprepared for the depravity of the movie. Even after surviving ""Antichrist"" and ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" the film goes down to levels so vile, it makes the film one of the most controversial films in cinema history and there are very good reasons why the film is banned from many countries. My friend and I have a strong stomach, but watching the newborn scene halfway through the movie is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. I'm an atheist, and the scene nearly made me want to baptized my eyes with holy water. While that is the most difficult hump to get through, the film doesn't get any better. Soon more graphic scenes of a depraved nature ensues, one nearly as heart wrenching and volatile as the newborn scene. The film, with all of its controversial scenes, changes you. And not for the better either. You feel almost sick for watching it or even admitting you have watched it. You name it, its probably in the film. Rape, murder, incestuous rape, murder by rape, murder while raping someone, necrophilia, and finally pedophilia. But one must ask; is all of this necessary to get across the point the director is vaguely pointing out? But one must also know the shock genre is intended for intelligent and strong audience members who can see the themes of the movies and actually think. Most Hollywood films are made for the average viewers with an average intellect, and most would rather not have to figure out the meaning and purpose of the film they're watching. They just want to watch a movie with a basic story to it and nothing turns out bad. These films are not for the average viewers.Yet, despite the horrific scenes, the movie is very well filmed with a huge emphasis on realism as everything looks absolutely realistic, very well written, and directed. Its also has an amazing performance by Srdjan Todorovic who plays Milos convincingly and with absolute dedication to his character. It's easy enough to kill people and have sex on camera, but to actually act and be in character is another thing and he is able to do all three while looking realistic and humane. ""A Serbian Film"" is a rough film that should not be taken lightly as it takes apart your soul and ideas of how far directors can go before passing that fine line of art film to pure, snuff film. But its worth watching if one is not light hearted and expecting a bland horror movie. This will tear you apart, even if you know what to expect. Nothing can prepare you for this film.",A Serbian Film

However I don't want to talk much about the moral side of the film. As a visual scenery is a bit better then a standard thriller not that bright though. The point where this movie shines for me is the two factors: Firstly the sound, it adds an immense depth to the film more so the final scene's sound is incredible you can sense the trauma with your eyes closed. So with the sound's contribution it deserves a 7. Secondly that boy oh my god that look on that little boy's face in the end is speechless. Probably it is a great sum up for the audience's face after watching the movie but how such a blank impression was created on that little boy's face is my biggest question after watching that movie so that it deserves and 8.

In the end I am not gonna say don't watch this film but put a little consideration before watching it and try to stand your spectator mode for the whole movie that's my suggestion.",A Serbian Film

They felt strongly about this matter, for they are natives to serbia. In the director's eyes, the film is about human victimization. One scene, possibly the most horrifying moment in cinema alone, featuring a newborn is the director's most blatant example of victimization on the movie, stating that we are, as humans, r*ped from birth, and it does not stop until after our death. I give this film a 11/10 for brutal honesty, a great soundtrack, perfect acting, and mostly.. the overall concept of the film very-well translated into a movie about p*rnography. Thank you for your time. (Goes well with popcorn... don't vomit!)",A Serbian Film
510,apatheticgeorge,All the Qualities of a Good Movie...,9,31 March 2016,"This movie is extremely vulgar and violent. If you are a sensitive viewer than you should pass this.The filming techniques are high quality and well captured. The sound affects are very immersive, realistic, and thought provoking.The characters are well developed and the actors do a good job at portraying them. The story is well developed and progresses very fluently through the eyes and psychology of the main character.However, for me some of the scenes realism seemed questionable which took away from the overall value. This is the only reason I decided to take away a star. I understand the reality of all of the scenes, and that these things do happen and exist in the real world. I am not claiming that they don't when I am making this point. ______________________________________________________________SPOILER ALERT(This is a very broad statement which may or may not ruin some of the story): I found two scenes in particular in which I felt that a death would have resulted from the actions depicted in which they did not. I understand that they did this so that the audience could better understand some of the actions and stimulate deeper thought, however it truly took away from the realism of a genuinely deadly action. END OF SPOILER _______________________________________________________My impressions of the story: This movie is shining light on highly controversial topics. It's a very thought provoking film which I would highly recommend others to watch. Bad things happen in the world and turning a blind eye to them does not help better them. This film should encourage us to better our humanity and prevent vile things from happening. It has several lessons that can be learned from mistakes of the main character as well. To further sum up, this film is both educational and morality inspiring. People who are offended by the vulgarity of this film are refusing to acknowledge the vulgarity of the very world in which we live.",A Serbian Film

512,aniruddhargowdaag,The most goring,5,12 June 2017,"This film was so close on being the worst thing I ever saw. But fortunately there are some element of this film that made me add three extra stars to it.. It is by far the most goring film I ever saw. It's about a porn-star who is retired.. But he's struggling with his current estate.. So he gets a job which is obviously about the ""art"" of pornography.. And then it just starts getting more goring and suspenseful. It's an average film with realism and good cinematography that often gets too cringe. Adding a wife and a son to the main character helps with the emotional element of the film. And there's a moment with him and his family which is cringe but surprisingly sad at the same time. The emotions of the actors are well captured. They did a great job. My only issue with it is, it's too goring. I love violence. But this movie exceeds the limit! It ends with a strong message.. Overall, I think if you make it through it's violence, it's worth a watch.",A Serbian Film
513,idol_wild,Shell Shocked,7,22 July 2010,"A Serbian Film defies belief and resists categorization. It doesn't belong to any particular genre and crosses many boundaries. Perhaps the best way to note this is via the way it mixes the tropes of the horror film with the *aspirations* of a documentary. There can be no denying that the film is an act of transgression - it sets out to 'outrage and violate basic mores and sensibilities' (to quote the hallowed Wikipedia). Make no mistake though - A Serbian's Film's transgressive act is itself grounded in moral outrage. Ironically, the bland title provides the best way to get a handle on its extremities. This is a Serbian film - which is to say, it is the product of a country torn apart by a civil war and still in a state of shock. Consequently, the film is a document of that horror and is ideally understood as a gaping wound.The plot is pretty straightforward: its the execution that is way out there. It's probably best to experience the film like the main character. Despite the building dread, allow yourself to be lulled into a false sense of security so as to be caught unawares. So relax and enjoy the peep show. And then be prepared to watch it from behind your fingers. You might even throw up in your mouth.Don't come here looking for restraint or circumspection - overkill is literally its theme and directive. It arguably treats its analogy too literally - it depicts the rape and destruction of a country within the context of a snuff movie. A Serbian Film takes the pornographic notion of nationalism and exposes its dark underbelly. You can decide whether A Serbian Film's main analogy cuts a little too close to the boner though.Since the film primarily emerges from the psychological state of its embattled protagonist, we invariably see the snuff movie that is Serbia through his glazed eyes. The porn star's resulting trauma - his moral descent and degradation - invariably becomes a place marker for Serbia's own traumatized psyche, leaving the viewer similarly besieged and shell shocked.If your looking for a serious examination of the Serbian conflict or a moral dissection of war crimes, you've definitely come to the wrong place. And if you've come here to get off on the possibility of sexually explicit material or gratuitous violence , be very afraid (and generally disappointed): this is in no way 'entertaining'. The film is essentially a catalog of escalating horrors and moral affronts. It's no accident that sex and violence are joined at the (severed) limb, or part of its theater of war. Particularly unfortunate is the film's tendency to transfer moral responsibility onto a government guilty of whipping its populace into a frenzy. According to A Serbian Film, citizens didn't really know what they were getting into: they were just following orders in a state induced haze and euphoria. That might be true enough, but such a displacement (or aversion) betrays a curious lack of courage where it morally counts. Nonetheless, the film remains a testament to the filmmaker's integrity when probing an exposed wound in such unflinching and uncompromising terms.",A Serbian Film
514,tejal567,Really a very sick movie,5,27 July 2016,"A Serbian Film is about retired porn star Milos (Srdjan Todorovic), a middle-aged man struggling to provide for his family who is lured back into the industry for one last film. He has been offered enough money to set him up for life but, in return, has signed a Faustian pact with the director Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovic). Milos will have no control over the scenes in which he appears.The opening sequences shows Milos's young son innocently watching some of his father's greatest ""hits"" on the family TV. We see the doe-eyed kid looking innocently as Milos struts his stuff in some ludicrous Robin Askwith-style blue movies. The parents are shocked to discover that he has stumbled on such images and quickly turn it off. The scene is disorienting but also comic. It highlights the preposterousness of the world from which Milos has fled.",A Serbian Film
515,DonnieDarko6666,"just a few thoughts on the movie ""A Serbian Film""",10,20 July 2010,"I've seen "" A Serbian Film"" twice now in between 3 days. I didn't know a thing about the topic or anything concerning the hype etc...All i knew was his name ""A Serbian Film"" and something about porn when i watched it the first time.I don't know how many movies I've seen in my life-it must be thousands-and special ones from a man with a movie camera from Dziga Vertov to Baise-moi, ex drummer, Martyrs, Salo or Gummo or Eternal Sunshine of a spotless Mind or Alexandra's Project or, Lynch Movies or Haneke's or whatever there is- and furthermore any kind of movie not just gory and weird stuff .I could go on and on with titles but would never come up with the experience a Serbian film was to me. I just watched it again an hour ago still thinking of the impact this ""Masterpiece"" has on you. And it is not like people wrote above just a sickening film and one to be banned and punished-no it's one of the most intelligent films I've seen lately or this Year .It is an film you have to watch at least twice or even more-each viewing brings out little details missed in the seeing before-and i don't mean gory Details or stuff like this-i mean criticism and statements in different ways not only for Serbia but for all countries. I wouldn't want to mention any examples before you've seen it yourself-but up to now i said that Donnie Darko or Survive Style 5+ or Ex Drummer are the films I honor the most- now i must say a Serbian film comes even first or at least somewhere between the others! This is, quite simply, a flat-out brilliant film. There are definitely no unimportant scenes. I clearly love this movie specifically because I didn't know the twists and the turns- I was expecting something that would probably look cheap and trashy, instead it looks as handsome as the most prestigious film from a major studio. I won't spoil anything but can say the ending is exactly as the movie needs it to be and totally brilliant! A Serbian Film is a piece of Art-but one that is going far beyond Insanity and Exquisitness-pushing the boundaries that were left ..I'd say the weirdest and hardest graphic Film I've ever seen on one hand-but on the other hand a MASTERPIECE in directing, editing, acting, lighting, screen writing, scoring and creating pictures in it's most extreme artificial and artistic way.....watch it if you dare.. It's sick and twisted and....just Unbelievable!!!! A comment to all these people who haven't seen the film but talking about punishing the Director for it's content-to all those let be said-watch it first -if you dare- and then TALK!! A Serbian Film hit me too like a shot of adrenaline to the body and brain. Emotional, angry and intense having no words, this might be one of the best films I've seen in a long time and will see in the future. Watching it the second time I can say it is even more. In Addition to the written above I have to add that no one- I repeat no one should see ""A Serbian Film"" without knowledge of what he will experience. The Movie did something to me and I am used to seeing weird and extreme over the top stuff! This one is to handle with EXTREME CAUTION!!!!!",A Serbian Film

I can't recall the last time I watched a movie and was on the edge of my seat due to the intense shocking factor of said film. It's ridiculous, psychotic, insane, ABSOLUTELY wrong and... AMAZING. It will DOWNRIGHT, MIND F*** YOU. I'm absolutely crazed about any film that will leave me in desperate illusion about what happens next in the world it takes place at and that's what this did. Not to mention, the acting, cinematography, soundtrack, SCRIPT and STORY (the way it was executed) were perfectly executed.It's a nasty story (But unbelievably amazing film). It's not for the faint of heart. But if you can handle perversed, intense, horrifying cinema, WATCH THIS! I want to call it ""beautiful"" but I feel wrong doing so, BECAUSE of it's STORY! I believe in everyone being entitled to their own opinion BUT if you could not handle this film, then you need to turn your cheek and let it go rather than B****ing about how ""bad"" it is.

I think the film makers really captured his sense of bewilderment and loss of control when he was drugged.Saying that without giving too much away there were two scenes that utterly shocked me and I would not recommend this film for the faint hearted.I think however horrifying the things that happened his character was strong and he remained consistent both when he was sober and when drugged Some others have said it was comparable to Martyrs, this film was actually more affecting as the violence had purpose and they were seeding a story and you related to the characters",A Serbian Film
525,amandadavis-56485,Warning: Not fit for many viewers!!!,7,3 July 2020,"Just like many other horror fans out there, I have become quite jaded to the scary movie However, this is not what I would call any normal horror film. I knew it was being compared to snuff films, but wasn't a real one, and I also knew many people believed it real at first. But nothing could've prepared me for what I saw and experienced. It is rated NC-17, but I in no way believe it is fit for anyone under the age of 21, if fit for anyone at all to be honest. As far as movie making goes, this one was great, but when it comes to what this movie is actually about, that is an ENTIRELY different story. Watching this was difficult at times, but by the time I realized how bad it was, I was to far in and felt as if I had to get to the end, honestly just so it would be over. No matter how intense the viewing experience was, it compares none to the emotions felt afterwards. It's like the bad taste medicine leaves in your mouth and just about impossible to rid yourself of. I felt as if I had committed as heinous a crime as these actors did just by viewing the film. Immediately after the it was over, my partner and I were silenced, there were no words and I even found myself crying later on and cringing at what I had witnessed. The images and horrible acts didn't leave me for days and even then I had to make myself block them from my mind. Dwelling on it was too much and it was easier to act as if I'd never viewed it to begin with.I know this review has said a lot, but this film definitely gives you a new perspective of true evil and gruesome acts. I don't necessarily regret watching it, but I have no intent of doing it again and have even deterred friends from watching it. Nobody I knew had heard of this film and I honestly can't recall how we came across it, especially since it was difficult to find. We had to watch it on YouTube and I don't believe you can view it on there anymore due to it's graphic nature.I am trying not to cause any spoilers throughout this review, but just know this is not for the faint of heart or even the bravest of men. I don't believe anyone is truly ready for a film like this, unless you are into snuff films, and I mean hardcore snuff. I personally can't imagine being into this type of thing, but to each their own. However, I do feel the need to make one comment that could be considered a spoiler. There are two scenes in the film that involve extremely horrifying incidences with children, and these are the main parts that effected me so intensely.

526,jg-61073,Proceed With Caution,7,20 June 2018,"WOW... ok this is the first review I've done in a few years so I may be a little rusty now with that said I'm a HUGE horror fan and have seen all of the popular ""extremes"" to come down the pipe in the last few years and my friends, in terms of extreme and downright disturbing content, this one puts them ALL to shame in the worst (and best) of ways! 
 The setup here is pretty simple (older porn star agrees to one last job for a huge payday yet isn't allowed to know anything about the script) and is told in a fairly straightforward slow burn-exploitation format but what sets this one so far apart is how real and well done the film is before the real horror starts. Milos (our protagonist) is just a family man trying to make ends meet and this is one of the few horror films where you Really feel for the main character and that's a big part of what makes all the downright SICK S@&$ that happens in the second half that much worse. The acting was a lot better than you'd expect from this type of film (especially from Milos) and helps add the emotional weight that really makes this a knee-breaker. Another huge aspect ASF gets right: this is scary as h@ll before anything really happens thanks to some absolutely top notch cinematography and a synth based score that will chill you to the bone and lets you know right away that some VERY bad things are coming and oh god do they ever... 
 After a couple of very uncomfortable shoots at the start of his ""film"" Milos tries to back out and he (and us viewers) are dropped into a nightmare that is not going to be soon forgotten. There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said in terms of shocking content but I'm still shaking this film off as I type this so here's my 2 cents anyway: there really is a line of ""showing too much"" and this film wallows in crossing it and assaulting the viewer with truly the most disgusting scenes ever put on legit film (at least in the uncut version)! Honestly I would have given this an 8 had this been the cut version and showed A LITTLE restraint. That's not to say this isn't a quality horror film because it is of the highest kind just one that's impossible to recommend because of said scenes and the very real damage they could have on people. 
 In closing this is our generation's ""Dare Film"" if you will. That ONE movie that you ""bet someone won't watch"" and for good reason. It's as much porn as it is horror and to say it's not for everyone would be the understatement of the year but ultimately I went in expecting a very strong political horror film and that's exactly what I got, and the need to take about 15 showers. It was clearly made by angry expert film makers that wanted to REALLY shock and make a good movie doing it and they succeeded in making one of the most disgusting and brutal films EVER.

I'm glad i did, because its original and a real eye opener into how evil the real world can be, an i'm sure is for some people. I found this film shocking, yet very believable.

533,crazylamb1,The other side of the story - the underlying messages.,8,11 May 2011,"Like many have said, this movie contains gore/shock value, etc. However, that's not the only side of this story.Realistically, watching this film, sure the scenes were disgusting and shocking... However, what this made me think of personally is just what some people have had to deal with, for instance during war. In war, as a soldier you really don't have much choice as to what you're going to do. You have to take orders or suffer the consequences. Oftentimes, this included participating in or watching scenes of rape, even children, murder, beheadings, etc. All the nasty stuff depicted in this film. Personally, that's how I viewed the film and honestly, it made me more compassionate towards soldiers and what they go through. Really, if I lived through something this shocking, I don't know that I could go on living, so it's no surprise that oftentimes veterans commit suicide. So it definitely did send a message to me, hence why I enjoyed this film (hmm..not sure that ""enjoy"" is the appropriate word - appreciated would be more like it). Not seeing the gory scenes would probably not have had such a profound effect on me. I wouldn't end up thinking ""I'd probably kill myself if I had to go through that"". So, that was my take on it and it definitely wasn't just ""shock-value"" like many claim. It can have a profound message.",A Serbian Film
