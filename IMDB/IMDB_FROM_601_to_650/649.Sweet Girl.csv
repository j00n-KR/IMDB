0,Leofwine_draca,Flawed but enjoyable,6,28 August 2021,"A problematic film, this one, but not without merit. Localised and shot in and around Pittsburgh so as a Romero fan that was a nice treat. Jason Momoa can do this kind of role in his sleep by now so he's as good as you'd expect. The big pharma back story is very timely, but it never really ties up with the BOURNE style hitmen and bodyguards running around all over the place, it doesn't feel too realistic. The writing is kind of sloppy here. As for the big twist at the climax, I didn't mind it all that much personally but I can see how some might. One strong point is the action choreography which is always on point.",Sweet Girl
1,SnoopyStyle,Momoa does a Neeson,5,25 August 2021,"Ray Cooper (Jason Momoa) is devastated from his wife's cancer death after greedy Pharma executive Simon Keeley (Justin Bartha) withdraws an experimental life-saving drug. Ray vows revenge on national TV. He is contacted by an investigative reporter. His daughter Rachel (Isabela Merced) follows him to the meeting. The reporter is killed by an assassin. Ray and Rachel are both terribly hurt in the incident.I'm fine with the last act. In fact, that adds a little spice to a generally bland Neeson-like script. I hated the Home Alone feel of the confrontations. If the hitman brings a gun, we bring a knife. If the hitman brings a knife, we bring a lamp. It gets a bit annoying. The ending helps a little with that but it still would be better if he simply turns into a cold-blooded killer. Nevertheless, this feels like a script from the Neeson rejects pile. Momoa will have to do better if he wishes to continue down this road.",Sweet Girl
2,nogodnomasters,It wasn't supposed to end this way,8,25 August 2021,"The film opens with Aquaman talking the Jason Bourne jump off of a building. We then go back in time. Ray Cooper (Jason Momoa) and his daughter Rachel (Isabela Merced) are with their mother when she dies from cancer. The miracle drug that could save her was suddenly pulled from the market by Bioprime who spiked it. Ray meets a reporter who claims he has evidence it was all a scam involving all kinds of people and off shore accounts. After the reporter is stabbed right in front of him, Ray decides he wants answers. This leads to a trail of blood as Ray and his daughter are both fighters and are being hunted.I liked the twist at the end, although I think it might have made a better film without it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Sweet Girl
3,kosmasp,Sour Girl too,7,24 August 2021,"But having two flavors mostly is a good thing right? Now the question that remains is: can Jason Mamao carry an action movie? Well actually I reckon we know the answer to that. And while we do .. there might be things here ... we don't know.Let's just say that the movie has a twist waiting for you. Maybe you're able to see it coming, but I have to admit as surprising as I thought it is .... it didn't really make much sense in the overall context. With what we saw and how it played out. I won't say anymore, because this is one of the USP of the movie - the unique selling point of it to be truthful.Because most of the rest is quite ordinary. I don't think the fight scenes will get you too excited (well done, but not amazing in any sense of the word). Having said all that I understand if you feel the movie does not deserve that twist (or any others who are way more on the nose and predictable). It does have a theme that will resonate with many though - or themes. Family and health care. Bernie Sanders may or may not be proud of that (not sure how he feels about violence, but I doubt he condones it, no matter the circumstances).",Sweet Girl
4,Sleepin_Dragon,The end of the world......is how it felt.,4,27 August 2021,"I've given it a few stars because of the opening few minutes, I initially thought great story, a terrific story to tell, a man taking revenge against a greedy pharmaceutical company, sadly after about fifteen minutes it changes.Fifteen minutes in, you get a typical trashy American shoot'em up, with an average guy taking down four armed men with no weapon on him....that is until he starts running around with an axe.You get the cheesy dialogue throughout, talk of being a family, staying strong etc, it is quite literally vomit inducing.Momoa....in the first fifteen minutes we get to see him actually acting, and he was really good, playing against the stereotypical hunky action beefcake, sadly he falls straight into that after the strong opening.I lost patience with it very quickly, and found that I quite literally couldn't care less about the outcome or direction.I would quite literally call it an hour and fifty minutes of trash TV, if you like trashy, mindless films you may enjoy it, sadly a good story got very lost in this. 4/10.",Sweet Girl
5,Tweekums,Decent action thriller with a twist,7,23 August 2021,"As this thriller opens we see Ray Cooper being confronted by law enforcement officers on the roof of a Pittsburgh stadium; rather than be arrested he jumps into the river. The action then jumps back several years; Ray and his daughter Rachel are with his wife in hospital. She has cancer but the doctor tells them that a cheap treatment is about to be released... not long after he must tell then that due to a deal with the patent holder the new affordable drug won't be available. As the CEO of the medical company responsible appears on a talk show Ray call in and tells him that if his wife dies he will kill the man. She does die. Sometime later Ray is contacted by a journalist who says he has evidence of illegal activity by the company; Ray goes to meet him, followed by Rachel. At the meeting the journalist is killed and Ray is injured. Ray then sets about getting even with the CEO before fleeing with Rachel; they are pursued by shady characters.This is a solid enough thriller; the sort you enjoy while watching but don't feel the need to watch again. The plot isn't the most original; but that isn't too much of a problem as it serves to get ordinary man Ray to seek revenge before fleeing with daughter Rachel. The action scenes are enjoyable and there is a fun variety of locations. Jason Mamoa and Isabela Merced are solid as Ray and Rachel respectively; there are also decent performances from Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as the hitman they cross paths with and Lex Scott Davis as sympathetic FBI Agent Sarah Meeker. There is a major plot twist, which I won't describe as it would ruin the fun for first time viewers. I didn't see it coming and while it is a bit farfetched it wasn't as ridiculous as things I've seen in other action films. Overall I wouldn't say this was a must watch but it is fun enough if you like action films and don't demand too much realism.",Sweet Girl
6,paul_haakonsen,"Watchable, but that was about it...",5,24 October 2021,"I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Sweet Girl"" without actually having heard about it prior to getting to watch it. But I figured a movie with Jason Momoa on the cast list couldn't be all bad. So of course I sat down to watch ""Sweet Girl"".And this 2021 action thriller from writers Gregg Hurwitz and Philip Eisner was adequately entertaining, although somewhat generic. The storyline was fair enough, although the writers were cashing in on just about every trope seen in action thrillers before. However, I will say that there was a twist to the storyline, one that I will not mention here, of course, and I hadn't seen that coming. So whether or not the twist to the story was good or bad is up to personal interpretation of course. Personally, then I wasn't much fan of that twist, though it was unforeseen.There is a good amount of action in ""Sweet Girl"" and the action sequences are nicely choreographed and executed, and that definitely helps to carry the movie, as the storyline alone was having ups and downs.Now, the movie has Jason Momoa on the cast list, and he does carry the movie well enough. But I have to say that the long hair and beard is growing thin - not physically or literally on him - but in the sense that it is becoming a nuisance to look at. In just about every single movie he looks the same, so it is becoming progressingly more and more difficult to tell his different characters apart from different movies.While I managed to sit through ""Sweet Girl"" and found it to be adequately entertaining, it just wasn't an outstanding action thriller, and there are far better movies in that genre out there. This was, at best, the type of movie that you sit down to watch once and then never again.My rating of ""Sweet Girl"" lands on a very bland and generic five out of ten stars.",Sweet Girl
7,searchanddestroy-1,Why making simple when you can do it complicated?,3,16 September 2021,"BEWARE SPOILERS BELOWI have nothing against the fact that the Jason Domoa's character disappears from the film after the two third - as John Wayne in THE COWBOYS or François Damiens in also LES COW BOYS - or even earlier if you consider the ""real"" story; no, what I find totally lousy is that the audiences realize this was not him who performed all those scenes but his daughter. Why? Why?The only thing I like is the hired killer character, maybe because he doesn't lokk like a killer. I like the scene where he speaks of his childhood and his slaughtered village and family. That's all I like in this lousy and incomprehensible crap.",Sweet Girl
8,Calicodreamin,Lacks depth,4,20 August 2021,"The characters and storyline lacked depth, making it hard to get into the film or care about the outcome. The cast had no chemistry and the acting was bland. While there was a fairly decent twist, by the time you get there you're bored out of your mind and don't care.",Sweet Girl
9,deloudelouvain,Watchable but that's it.,6,21 October 2021,"Sweet Girl is the kind of action movie where not everything makes sense, where there are a lot of moments you think ""Yeah, right..."", but in the end it's entertaining enough to keep your attention. I didn't see the twist coming towards the end, so that was a bonus. But do I need to watch it again in the future? Certainly not. For that it's just not good enough, plus I thought the acting of Isabela Merced was sometimes not very convincing. Jason Momoa on the other hand was convincing but it's just not Oscar material. I don't regret watching it though, sometimes I like to watch mindless popcorn movies and Sweet Girl just fits in that category.",Sweet Girl
10,siderite,"Classic revenge flick, with a dumb twist",5,30 August 2021,"Two thirds of the film you are going to ask yourself two questions: 1. Why is the movie called Sweet Girl when it is all about Jason Momoa? And 2. How can that little adolescent turd not be wrecked with guilt for her stupidity and instead is sanctimonious and judgemental with her father and continues to never listen to anything he says? The twist provides the answer to both and it's pretty satisfying, but it works for about a second before you realize that it invalidates most of all the other things that happened until then. Then comes the ending, which is really weak.Maybe if I could have been invested in any of the characters beyond a generic sob story and a generic villain that anyone hates, I would have enjoyed it more. There is no positive to watching the film, the action scenes are generic, the story is generic, the characters are generic. Other than the twist, which feels very 1990s anyway, there is nothing that is not forgettable five minutes after the credits roll.",Sweet Girl
11,Cineanalyst,Stupid Twist Ruins Already Stupid Movie,2,26 August 2021,"I was just going to write about star Jason Momoa's blathering bookending voiceover narration, the repetitive time jumping early on, the formulaic and cliché-ridden conspiratorial action-revenge script, how unbelievable it is that a pharmaceuticals CEO would take questions from the public on a TV broadcast, and how the daughter is an annoying and unnecessary tag-along character, but then ""Sweet Girl"" turns out to be made by wannabe M. Night Shyamalan hacks who add a twist to the otherwise generic variation of ""The Fugitive"" (1993), and it's a doozy of utter stupidity. It literally adds nothing but a lot of otherwise needless padding to the proceedings to foreshadow it. The movie could've been cut in half without it, and it would've been much better for it. I mean, there'd still be nothing of value here, but it'd be shorter. Really, 110 minutes of this mundane nonsense! What a complete waste of time.",Sweet Girl
12,paulclaassen,"Oh, hell no, what a mess!!",2,12 November 2021,"Clearly, the film industry has depleted its originality on genre movies. 'Sweet Girl' plods along on overly familiar territory without adding anything new, making it feel stale.Jason Mamoa stars as Ray Cooper, a man out for revenge after his wife dies. Ok, this may sound like a fair enough reason for anyone to go on a vengeance trip, but here's the snag. His wife died of cancer, so the people he is out to avenge were not directly responsible for her death. The CEO of a pharmaceutical company called BioPrime pulled drugs from the market just days before his wife was to be treated. Ok, now my sensible mind tells me there's no way a company would pull drugs from the market unless there weren't a valid reason for it. Now they're made out to be murderers... oh, what the f...!If you think this premise sounds ridiculous, wait, there's more - and I have no option here than to do SPOILERS, so if you haven't seen the movie and don't want to know, stop reading. The film depicts Ray as the film's protagonist, but this guy kills innocent people (in the form of bodyguards) in the process, and I'm supposed to root for him?? At times the film felt like a toned down version of 'John Wick' (and I absolutely HATE John Wick - with a passion!!). Ray and his daughter Rachel are on the run with the 'bad guys' and authorities on their trail. He stages set-ups that are just not believable, like having access to road signs and setting traps he couldn't possibly have managed. Ray keeps killing people, and keeps telling Rachel he had no choice. Seriously...?Then there's a twist during the final act - nothing short of preposterous, I might add. As it turns out, Ray died two years ago, and Rachel was the one on the run and doing all the killings. Rachel is just a kid, and they want me to believe she was able to outwit and even fight with trained bodyguards, and falling from a window onto a car and not being injured??? They even showed back flashes how she did it (and not Ray), and I'm supposed to believe this garbage?? This was just too reminiscent of the equally preposterous and absurd twist in 'Identity'. Now read the previous paragraph and I ask you again how it would be remotely possible for a girl to accomplish all this??40 Minutes into the movie I still couldn't get into it. Halfway through I was tempted to stop watching. I should have listed to my instinct...Would I watch it again? Hell, no!",Sweet Girl
13,cruise01,Jason Mom and Isabela Merced shine but in a dull action thriller.,6,4 November 2021,"3 out of 5 stars.Sweet Girl is a fair action thriller film that gives Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced the action spotlight. It is a decent action thriller that is entertaining. It is nothing more besides filled with its action clichés, decent pharmaceutical greedy corporations plot, and okay action sequences.What Worked? Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced did great with there roles. Playing father and daughter after losing there mother Amanda (Adria Arjona). And there was a treatment for her illness. But corporate greed took the treatment off the market for there personal profit. Ray (Jason Momoa) and Rachel (Isabela Merced) both follow up with the investigation. And come across hired hitman who are trying to cover up any investigations. Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced taking the action spotlight is exciting. And has a lot of potential.It has its decent action sequences. Nothing more special than a one time watch and getting entertained by it. The direction is okay but forgettable.There is a twist that turns it into an interesting exciting direction which was cool to see the third act playing out.What did not work?The plot is like a revenge story. Add a bit of pharmaceutical conspiracy and corrupt corporate greed. Which adds nothing special to the story. Then, having assassins chasing Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced throughout. FBI agents on there trails and steps behind them.It is a typical cliché action thriller where the assassin and FBI are always a step behind the two main characters. No matter how good they cover there tracks.Sweet Girl is an okay action thriller that shines the spotlight on the two leads but forgettable story and direction that does not add anything new to the genre.",Sweet Girl
14,pmtelefon,I didn't care about anybody for the first hour,4,25 August 2021,"I've never been there but a have a soft spot with any movie that's filmed in and around Pittsburgh, PA. I blame it on the films of George Romeo but who knows? The terrific location photography is the only part of ""Sweet Girl"" that's worth watching. It's a silly piece of propaganda aimed at an audience that's too old to care. The likeable cast ends up spinning their wheels in pretty bad material.",Sweet Girl

Will Ray and his daughter Rachel(Moner) fight justice?Overall I thought I wasn't that bad at all but the premise reminds me of a film that Keanu Reeves would star in(I think it's either John Wick or maybe it was an Arnold Schwarzenegger film I dunno) but again it's a film that Keanu would star in.There is a twist in this film that I didn't see coming involving Ray or even Rachel.",Sweet Girl

Who doesn't love Jason Momoa? He's rough and tough, perfect for this action flick. He's the reason why most people will watch this movie. He works very hard in this film and takes a beating to entertain us. He also shows some emotional depth.Isabela Merced is adorable. Did you see her in Dora And The Lost City Of Gold (Cute movie.) This film shows Isabela Merced can do a lot more than just be cute.Justin Bartha plays a Millennial corporate hack which is a departure from his typical wise-cracking sidekick character. I've always liked him.It's been a long time since I've seen Amy Brenneman in anything. I think I first noticed her many years ago in Casper. It's good to see her again.There is a ""Special Thanks"" section of the movie credits that lists Kevin Evanto. Sadly, he passed away several months before the film's release. He had worked hard on securing filming venues in Allegheny County for the movie.Fun fact: Pittsburg doesn't have yellow cabs, so one was specially designed for the taxi scenes in the movie.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The title is terrible. The song in the trailer doesn't match either.I love twists in movies, but the one that shows up in Act 3 doesn't quite work. Audiences aren't buying it.Cliched story and action scenes with all the predictable beats.There's actually a moment where a fight scene is so poorly filmed that you see Jason Momoa's fist intentionally miss his mark.Shaky cam makes me dizzy and annoyed.Unrealistic scenes.Slow pacing with a lot of long time gaps in the story.The dad (Jason Momoa) makes some really dumb decisions. It's as if the character has never watched a movie before that teaches you how to disappear and get revenge on bad guys. (wink)
Fans and critics alike are hating on this film and on Netflix. We've become extremely spoiled with great movies that have kept us entertained and even, at times, inspired so it doesn't seem fair to rip all over Netflix when they put out a stinker.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of bloody violence with various weapons and hand-to-hand combat
You see a woman die of cancer
Profanity, including F-bombs
Lots of destruction

33,danielmanson,Reviews are being far too negative,7,28 August 2021,"I'll be honest. I quite liked this film and I'm really not sure why there's so many people hating on it. I'm half convinced people just dump on Netflix films just because it's a Netflix film rather than actually giving it a chance.It's not Oscar winning by any stretch, but there's some fun action scenes, an amazing twist in the plot and an entertaining watch.The twist towards the end left me speechless, not once did it cross my mind that the plot would head in that direction so kudos there. The girl character/actress was fantastic also! I'm mentally scarred after being annoyed for 2 hours straight by the girl in War of the Worlds so I always like to mention if a young girl character isn't dead annoying.There are a couple of points in other reviews I do agree with. The film after the twist occurred felt a little dragged out, I felt like i was just waiting for it to end. And at parts (midway) the story felt like it was a little contentless and dense. But it all came together and in my opinion worked well to form this heart warming story.On a personal note I would have liked a little more depth from the ""villains"". So the hitman in particular, what's his story? Why is he so good at what he does? Give me something about him. And the pharma company and the people behind it. I just would have liked more depth on that front.Overall though it's a decent little watch and I'm glad I gave it a go! Good acting, good story and a fantastic plot twist. 7/10 today.",Sweet Girl

Maybe everyone need to start watching much more films to know what is à really bad film. Yeah, you won't see here static shots of 5 minutes showing a cow eating some grass, you won't see dialogues of 10 minutes saying things that could be said in 1 and you won't be finding double meanings in everything.However, this has what this genre requires the most: keeps you interested until the end, has an unexpected plot twist, generally with good acting and with regular production values. I was not so sure about the plot twist, but I will buy it, so, even with a weak plot, with some uninspired dialogue and doing more of the same, it's an ok action thriller.",Sweet Girl

Many who watch this movie can relate such a notion.Every character was well acted, and roles assigned were thought out wonderfully. You can feel the stress in jason's role as a father, and husband who only wants to save his wife using a new drug but was pulled from the market for reasons unknown. Most likely, the pulled drug Sparrow as it was called worked too well for patients.This would give the company reason to discontinue its use because of its ability to either curb cancer or cure it altogether, because if it did... then the pharm companies would lose billions in the process. This film gives a unique insight to the inner workings process where scientists can come up with cure but later are shelved because they work.The real agenda to such a company is... We don't cure people's illness's we sustain them. How do you think the military gets their payroll? It's a trillion dollar a year business to sustain rather than cure. And Sweet girl is a remarkable achievement to show us how bad it really is with such a corrupt institution.",Sweet Girl

Like they are using a new camera guy or something. I myself do not enjoy these movies and the way they look so fake. Just a personal opinion though. Now this movie was good, good story nice plot. I think the whole phycological storyline has been played out. I hate having to watch a movie and now when someone dies, I have to wait till the end to see if they actually died. What happened to just normal death in movies? Now if you enjoyed movies like Beckett then you will enjoy this one because they used the same camera guy. As for me I like my CGI in bulk.",Sweet Girl

By the time the middle act came around the film started unraveling a bit pacing getting a bit slower and movie getting a bit confusing at times. The final act the ""Twist"" if you want to call it that infuriated me so much I honestly wanted to turn the movie off. Maybe others would like it, but I wasn't a fan.With all that said though.

But it ended up being pretty awesome.,Sweet Girl
49,virindra,Good movie.,7,20 August 2021,"I like Jason Mamoa's movies. I like him as an actor and the story behind him as a man. Succes was not dropped in front of his feet and he had to make it on his own. I can relate to that.Being a father myself of a girl, I really enjoyed this movie. The fighting scenes were realistic, like how a common man would fight in real life. I did not understand why the daughter did not say to her father to take her with him, because he would not come back. Until the plot twist. I did not see that coming. The chase with the tow truck was awesome.The music at the background of the movie, really is at the background of the movie. For me that was quite a turn off. In action movies the music (soundtrack) is very important. I agree with some negative reviews; the characters in the movie, I just don't feel them. You can let the audiance feel you as an actor, if you act with emotions, showing more depth to your character.Beging negative nowadays is very easy. Sitting behind your computer. Writing down someone's hard work in a movie. That's just lame. Giving this movie a low rating, what it did not deserve. I enjoyed it a lot. Go and watch this one would be my advice. And please people, treat others like you would be treated. Don't be so negative.",Sweet Girl

.Unfortunately, director Brian Andrew Mendoza fails in this and gives Jason Momoa precious little to work with. The superstar from Aquaman plays the role of a tough-as-nails father who sets out to seek revenge on the Big Pharma executives responsible for his wife's death.Although Momoa imbues all the pain and menace his character requires, the villains are wafer thin and the action choreography too pedestrian for this film to leave any lasting impact on the viewer.Isabela Merced is terrific as his young daughter who looks to support her dad's insane attempts at getting justice but even she cannot hold together this trainwreck of a movie.Despite an unexpected twist towards the end, the audience is too exhausted and disillusioned by that point to even care.

55,Mivas_Greece,"A fugitive-like film, but with a lot of emotion, excellent direction and music and a mind-blowing twist. Definitelly recommended to everyone!",7,5 September 2021,"Crime / action / drama movie. The film feels intense from the beginning with a scene from around the middle of the film and then starts showing the events that led to that point. It is a story where someone fighting an injustice against him, is chased by everyone, an idea common on its own (one of the oldest standards was Fugitive with Ford), only this particular film tries to sensitize the viewer much more as it involves a family where the mother loses the battle against cancer as well the greedy company that produces the treatment, paid a large sum to a company with generics, in order to suspend the much more affordable generics indefinitely. The father therefore considers this company and the managing director responsible for the death of his wife. Alone, indebted to the treatments of his unfortunate wife and trying to support his daughter, he finally decides to fight those responsible for his wife's death. Together with his daughter, they become fugitives from the FBI, police and assassins. Although it is a common idea, there is a strong feeling and emotion, the direction along with the music is really exceptional, while we also have very good acting from everyone and especially from the young Isabela Merced (from Transformers 5, Dora the explorer etc) and Jason Momoa (better known as Aquaman) who could be a new Steven Siegal in these genre of movies. Overall a serious and well-crafted film and with a big twist shortly after the middle of the film, with a good plot / action ratio. Recommended to everyone.",Sweet Girl

The action scenes are poorly done, the shots are lousy, and the performances are unconvincing.

68,jindann,Quite unconvincing,5,25 August 2021,"Spoilers:The movie was fine in the beginning until the twist messes it up, which is very much why the movie received a low rating. The tunnel scene is as well unbelievable with the assassin appearing at the same time, the girl is supposedly 18 but looks like 14 while and overpowering a well trained assassin. Also a senator taking bribes to manipulate the release of a new drug with another company is just too flimsy. The movie did however reveal some sad truth about the pharmaceutical companies, their main interest isn't really to heal people, but rather to earn money and selling drugs at prices at harsh as a patient can bear. Which is why if there's a supplement that very likely to cure certain diseases or even work better than drugs, they have no interest on testing and developing on that, as natural supplements couldn't get a patent and earn money. The entry fee for a clinical trial is like 10m usd, is the reason they only do trails on newly invented patented drugs, selling them to the market at a high price to cover their costs. And the doctors were completely relying on the clinical trails results would only refer these drugs to patients, rather than supplements that only has early research evidences without trail results.",Sweet Girl

Then it went downhill, and it went downhill fast. Towards the second half of the film, every single cliché you've seen in other films will show up. Character is losing, then they hear a voice of a loved one and now they're okay. Character is injured, but not anymore because of illogical reasons. Character has a chance to kill villain but doesn't.The most illogical thing happens just before the end. You're telling me that after the main character had their name and face plastered on the news for days, and the FBI actively searching for them, all they had to do was get a new ID and then no one was after them?How were they able to walk through security?I recommend watching the first 10 minutes of the film, and then just turn it off, for your own sake.

Jason Momoa has a distinctive look not to mention size so him going into a launch dinner, spilling a drink on his target and leaving without being noticed is ridiculous. As was him being beaten up by a physically smaller guy in the train. Ludicrous. I didn't buy the father daughter relationship, it's been done before and much better by Jason Statham no less.

It catches the viewer's interest in wanting to know how Jason Mamoa's character got into that situation we see him in. It continues with introducing the protagonist's daughter and wife, we see how the wife is suffering from cancer and this is how the true villain of the story is introduced, big pharma. Now at first this really caught my interest, a thriller where our hero is going after a real life enemy of the people.Unfortunately the movie couldn't keep up with the interesting plot it tried to undertake. Jason Mamoa is great, especially in his emotional scenes in the beginning, but his and the woman playing his wife are the only good performances you'll see in this film. The movie continues to fall flatter and flatter as it progresses. I even fell asleep in the middle of the film, so you have an idea of how bad it is.As another reviewer mentioned, the film tries to be too many things at once and it turned out to be too much of a complicated mission for the director.

I figured it would be ruined by Netflix. I was wrong. I loved this movie. I predicted the ending but so what. The film kept me intrigued throughout. It had some real action packed/physical fight scenes as well as breathtaking cinematography at times.I also enjoy any movie that shines light on the pure evil big pharma companies.

I think it would have been great to go physically with Momoa, but once his character is dead, the girl should have won with cleverness and the fact that everyone is underestimating her. That would have made a lot more sense.2. The solution at the end, to get the Congresswoman to talk and record it, was way, way too easy. Why would she admit it after all? Rachael had NOTHING on her, nothing but hearsay and Congresswoman would have easily been able to talk her way out of it.3. The smartphone would no longer work after the fight in the water, at least not without a procedure to get it dry. Am I the only one bothered by stupid mistakes like this?4. What has the Congresswoman been doing after all? Why would she be responsible to pull the medicing that could have saved the mom? It did not make any sense to me, but maybe I did not understand this part.5. The ""plot twist"" was completely unnecessary and only there to have a plot twist. Nothing about it felt natural.I could list a lot of more things. Nothing about this movie was intriguing, interesting or exciting. There was not even one good idea to begin with.

First thing that will instantly catch your attention is Jason Momoa's performance from start to end. The amount of feel we get from his acting feels enough to carry the whole film. The other actors have also done quite a job. The story of this thrill drama infused movie seems heavily predictable in its entire run and the sole reason to that lies in the pattern of this movie, which was used in many predecessors before this one. The screenplay stands out as pretty basic or moderate from time to time. In the third act the story tries to hit us with a twist but that doesn't spark any fire because the overall presentation has minimal fire into it.

I don't know how old Dora was supposed to be in the cartoon but it looked like 12 and this girl was older than 12. The character in this movie appears to be a 15-16 year old and she does not look 15-16. With the new hollywood push to only hire gay to play gay characters or trans to play trans characters and other things they really need to hire people who look age appropriate.I am not saying her acting is bad I am just saying it takes away from the movie when you look at her and think no way this is a little girl or a teen. The movie was good enough but you have to leave your brain checked to get through it. It's one thing to say Wonder Woman just kicked those skilled attackers who also outweigh her by 100lbs but a regular little girl even with MMA training is not going to take on any skilled fighter who is bigger and faster than her. If she was going around thumping guys with dad bods that is different but it is just stupid to see tiny people beating bigger people. In fact, I have never seen a tiny guy been in a movie where he was kicking ass of much bigger guys. It only happens with small females and bigger trained fighters.Spoiler: The ""twist"" can be seen as soon as it was setup. Think the Sixth Sense. I know...I am one of those horrible people that can figure out twists most times. The only one that really got me was The Usual Suspects. Maybe I was too engrossed by the movie.

95,LaurieMann,Great Pittsburgh Photography Can Only Mean One Thing...,4,23 August 2021,"Sweet Girl is a ""evil company leads to my wife's death and I'm getting my revenge"" movie. As with many bad movies (see also Inspector Gadget) it has some really excellent photography of Pittsburgh, and only moderately bad movie geography. There's gross illogic all over the place (trying to escape a possible murder rap, the father and daughter are on the Pennsylvania Turnpike after saying they were going to stick to back roads). Two characters look a lot alike which is excessively confusing. There is an intriguing twist near the end, except that it makes absolutely no sense given the previous 70 minutes of the movie. Jason Momoa is a fine presence, but the young actress who played his daughter, Isabella Merced is really terrific.",Sweet Girl
96,nigepitz,Nowhere near as bad as the one star reviews say,6,24 August 2021,"Ok, it's like all modern action film, it's preposterous and stupid and has a heroine who doesn't look tough enough or strong enough to take on highly trained assassin and the plot twist is very silly.

98,zhivago97,"Not good, not bad, but very entertaining",5,24 August 2021,"On the plus side, this movie has a lot of interesting action, the acting is good and the pace moves along rather quickly. I never felt bored. The actors kept my attention throughout and the plot has plenty of suspense. The ""twist"" is good, albeit it's been done before many times.But this movie also has some significant downsides. This storyline itself, along with the ""twist"" are both recycled from other movies. And this movie is NOT the best example.Unfortunately everyone and everything is broken down into overly simplistic good vs bad. The problem with making characters one dimensional is that the storyline itself is on a very short rope by default, and can never evolve or truly surprise the audience because everything boils down to good guys vs bad guys.Big, evil pharmaceutical and corrupt politicians vs honest hard working families barely making ends meet in life. This is very tired territory.Aside from these downsides, overall it is still fairly entertaining and if you want a decent action packed movie, this is worth a watch. But don't come with high expectations.",Sweet Girl

112,guskeller,Generic tropes but reaches beyond,6,24 August 2021,"While Sweet Girl mostly falls into generic tropes, it reaches beyond in key ways. On the surface, the film is just another action revenge movie about a man on a rampage in the name of justice. We've seen it plenty of times before, so much so that it's become its own tired subgenre. Yet, Sweet Girl is slightly unique because of attempts at a political voice and a genuinely surprising twist along the way. Neither of these devices are executed ideally, but they make Sweet Girl fairly interesting and somewhat memorable. It's hard to call this movie ""good"" but these attempts elevate it above being condemned as ""bad"".Another positive take away from Sweet Girl are the performances of Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced. Neither is necessarily masterful, but both show a wide range of emotions and are convincing enough to keep viewers sold on this outlandish story. Unfortunately, the technical aspects of this movie are standard and slightly sloppy, which is disappointing for an action movie. However, the surprising amount of heart should keep audiences engaged. Overall, Sweet Girl falls short in many ways but remains decent due to passionate efforts in core areas.Writing: 6/10

Or how does the average person track downs a politician? How does one become a professional escape artist?The film does hook you, and the action is okay yet logically speaking... I am confused until the sharp plot twist toward the end connects the dots.. That twist was necessary for making this film more enjoyable.Verdict: sweet girl is like a sour patch kid, first it's sour but this time it forgets the sweet . It takes time for the build to reach an enjoyable climax. Decent action, and a subpar plot. For a Netflix film , you can't go wrong with throwing this on a Friday night! #netflixnochill.",Sweet Girl

This movie had me totally interested the whole time. Acting was what I consider good for the characters being portrayed. Yes watch it and it is not a waste of time as some have said. I'd like to get in debate with some critics; I retired as a former film maker editor etc. Critics have no clue what a really good film is. I gave this an 8. It was entertaining. 👍🏻🎥,Sweet Girl

123,soulcrisis28,Not THAT Bad...Not THAT Great Either...,5,30 August 2021,"Ok, so as you can see the reviews and ratings are all over the place on this one. I save the 1* ratings/reviews for the truly bad stinkers out there. As in people who can't and shouldn't act and never should've been cast and movies that are so bad they never should've been made, let alone put out for the public to see.That being said, this is not one of those movies. It has Jason Mamoa in it for crying out loud! The actors and acting were just fine and they did a good job. What falls short is the script, and that's not the actors fault. They can only work with what they're given to work with. If you give the greatest sculptor in the world trash to work with, he can only create more trash.The plot was not so bad either it was just executed very, very poorly. Big pharma pulls a certain medication needed to keep his wife alive from cancer and she dies cause of it. Any man would go off the deep end. That being said, like I said the story is what's crap. It's been done before and done way better. The twist was just lazy and unimaginable. Because it was lazy and dull it then caused the rest of the movie to be crappy.The action and fight scenes are so unbelievable it just takes you out of the movie and ruins it all together. It was too long too. Right when it felt it should've ended, surprise slap in the face and 20 more mins of garbage.If you like action and can leave your brain turned off and like Jason Mamoa then check it out, maybe you'll like it. I on the other hand can't turn my brain off when the movie is presented to me as being, or supposed to be realistic and non realistic things happen throughout the entire movie.",Sweet Girl

Of course!Person that regularly works out at a gym turns into a professional killer and car thief? Duh.Should we actually put some original thought and depth into the storyline?Nah.

Right. Each actor getting their heads smashed into glass and metal, not a scratch, then they keep fighting like nothing happened.

All corporations care not for their consumers or the planet, but only for their profits and there's no ceiling on that wealth when it comes to a capitalist country, you can get as ridiculously rich and monolithic as you like and the richer you get the more your riches multiply. So its obviously a very corrupt system which cannot sustain itself and there's ample examples and factual evidence of this, but like a tick corporate leaders are that dug in we feel powerless to them, and the majority of people don't even realize the tick is even there!. The worst part of these movies is that the police and FBI etc always attack the little guy, the guy trying to stand up for what are truly obvious human rights.. this is again a truth about how our western countries operate. Corporations get away with monstrous acts on a daily, meanwhile little individuals with real values will be crushed under the power that's meant to be there to protect them. Any officer who's joined the force seems to forget the fact that they joined for this reason, to protect and serve, that or they fail to realize how this motivation has been displaced to protect only the wicked rich. And I am a law enforcer only getting one day off a week, getting called a Nazi and having at least one person trying to fight me on a daily basis so it has me feel like my life is worthless even though I grew up a peace loving greeny with a family I love and friends and acquaintances. When will government be eradicated? Worldwide.. of course we can't just remove ours or we will most certainly have another move in with force. I mean world wide, every individual standing up against the tyranny of government and collectively creating true equality and homeostasis on our home planet Earth. Its a dream, and until its realized unfortunately my life truly is worthless.",Sweet Girl

161,kskmah,Seriously?,1,22 August 2021,"How can a teenage girl fight professional hit men and actually win? Oh yeah, in a stupid movie. The father couldn't barely hurt the hitman, but the girl did and actually killed him? Seriously? Also she recorded the congress woman admitting to crimes. But she was held with a knife to the neck and then all that is admissible in court because anyone would of said what the girl wanted to hear. Really stupid movie. Seriously what is going on with all these stupid unrealistic movies recently?",Sweet Girl
162,77Lynne,So bad.,1,22 August 2021,"This movie is just so bad, I don't even know where to begin. It's a very lazily written movie, full of occurrences that are completely unrealistic but help help the character's plot line move forward. Example one: Jason's character hides in the closet by the front door of a very small hotel room... breathing loudly but the bad guy (who is presumably is an expert at killing people) walks right by the closet to check the bathroom? Example two: Two armed guys in body armour are searching a hotel and yet appear to attract ZERO attention. Example three: A teen girl finds a payphone and not only does she know how to use it, she has change for it and is able to quite easily call the lead FBI investigator in her dad's case. I could go on. It may be a movie but it should be better written than this and have at least a little bit of complexity to it. The only thing that is impressive about this movie is that Jason was kind of ok at crying when the wife died.",Sweet Girl

164,benjaminlauriesmith,Unbelievably Stupid plot twist,4,21 August 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie for about eighty minutes then the plot twist happens.The beginning of the movie is quite emotional and very well acted by the cast.Then the movie begins its journey of action revenge thriller as you would expect.Plot twist happens and then I suppose you are not meant to think back on what you have just watched because if you do you then have to try and reason how a 50lb tiny girl subdues two 220+ bodyguards and another man on her own and then takes down another two trained assassin's on her own.Seriously? Please writes, directors, producers go and actually watch a fight. We don't put featherweights in the ring against heavyweights for a reason.The ending itself is also sadly predictable.Such a disappointing film as it starts off so well but then it's like they swapped out the writer/director/producers at the 3/4 point and replaced them all with the same Muppets who like to subvert expectations who have been ruining good TV since 2017Arrrrgggghhhh!!!!!

The acting was great, it was action filled, & then here comes the unexpected pleasantly surprisingly twist with a great ending!!! But why oh why did Jason's character had to die : (
Man!!! Once again, What a GREAT MOVIE from J. Momoa!!What did catch my eye is that the daugter got a cell phone w/o going to the store. Other than that. It was another hit for me.Jason keep doing your thang for those of us who LOVE YOU. This isn't the first movie with a twist & won't be the last.

168,arakirokuro,bad third act,6,29 August 2021,"Unfortunately, for me, the twist in the third act ruined the film. I simply did not believe it. Suspension of disbelief in a superhero film is one thing, but I become irritated when a grounded film suddenly disregards physics and continuity, breaking the laws defined inside its own world.

You never get a chance to love the main character because he is in fact the bad guy. The daughter has super powers evidentially, since she can beat up grown men... not just grown men, but hitmen...Within the first fifteen minutes, I was already aware of what I was in store for, and I still watched the entire movie.While its not a waste of time, it has scenes that are so ""unrealistic"" that you may be annoyed.I think Jason Mamoa can hold a movie by himself, I think he's a strong enough actor, but the script needs to match the play, and they need to humanize him a bit more like they did in the beginning of the movie when he cried.",Sweet Girl
170,nlsteven-attheMovies,Not So Sweet,5,4 November 2021,"Sweet Girl is an entertaining action flick if you are in the mood for ludicrous fight scenes and a no-brainer revenge story.

172,imvaughn,Enjoyed it,7,22 August 2021,Guess it's the cool thing to dog every movie that comes out. I judge movies purely on are every entertaining. Not are they realistic. Like it's a freaking movie not a documentary. In the movie they clearly established the girl had been training in boxing and martial arts since she was a about 8. That's 10 years. Fueled by 1. The fact that she thinks these people killed both her parents 2. The element of surprise because most of the people sent to kill her probably thought a girl was easy to kill.The plot twist was surprising and good. I enjoyed it.,Sweet Girl

174,neelsmail,Renewed Formula,3,21 August 2021,"This kind of plot was kinda somewhat frequent in 80s\90s. They renewed it. That is not a bad thing although there are some quite, quite, interesting movies around same theme. This doesn't come even close to them.But that is not the worst part. Movie is 1h49m. Although it doesn't become boring, at the end of it, you realize that there was essentially NO character development at all - by that I mean, you don't get to know characters in depth more than you did when you started to watch this movie. They are static. It was as though, all they needed to do was read lines and Jason Momoa would do the rest.If you want to have movie running in background while you do something else, sure, go ahead.",Sweet Girl

176,docdra,Dumb and Dumber?,3,21 August 2021,"I'm not even sure how to unpack all the silliness that is this movie, especially without giving away the only spoiler that exists in it.It doesn't start off too bad, but then the daughter quickly ruins whatever the dad had planned in the way of investigating the circumstances that led to his wife's death and it never picks up from there.There's a big pharma conspiracy - okay, that checks - not too long ago they busted a few pharmaceutical companies involved in price fixing scheme. So we can see how that could happen.Corrupt politicians that pretend to be against said corruption while secretly aiding and abetting it - checks out too - has happened, continues to happen with political parties all over the world.However, everything else in the movie is pure and utter crap. You'll be asking yourself, ""What is wrong with her,"" or, ""Why would he do something so stupid,"" and when it becomes clear why, you'll roll your eyes and go, ""Really, this is stupid."" Even for a movie...On top of the issues with the script, the pacing was horrendous. It seemed as if they were rushing for most of the movie, but then it would slow to a crawl in other spots. Although, they could have added another 45 minutes and it wouldn't have helped much.People like to say, ""It's entertainment, it isn't meant to be real."" Yeah, well, when I watch fantasy I like dragons, mages, and fairies.

Acting was fair, action scenes were mediocre to Fair.Then comes the plot twist that stretches the story beyond incredulity. You find that most of the action scenes - fights, murders, get aways, were not done by Jason Momoa, but carried out by his 12 year old daughter. And mostly in sloppy, flailing manner. The light-weight 12 year old manages to kill an experienced assassin in a hand to hand fight. The way she had been portrayed gives little support to the idea she could accomplish thiis task. All of the teenage daughters revenge killings only made me wish that Arya Stark had been called in to do all this.",Sweet Girl

They could have made the twist much more interesting, its consequences too, but nope, all we are left is the feeling of ""what?

194,bornskeptic,Typical Netflix,4,5 September 2021,"This would be a passable time waster except it took too much time to get where it was going. I think it was an hour and 50 minutes. They should have trimmed it to 1 1/2 hrs. Way too much padding which both creates boredom and exposes plot holes big enough to drive a vintage Olds through.The acting was good enough and the story was fine. Better suited for an early aughts action/conspiracy/revenge hybrid. All this has been done before, and better. They just assumed they could get away with it by planting Jason Momoa in it. Though likable, not enough star power yet for the guy. He is no Dwayne Johnson.Not giving away much but there is a twist late in it that is just stupid and clumsy and kind of ruins everything you saw in the previous hour. Somehow it fits this movie. (insert eye roll emoji here).The only thing clever once you consider the twist was the movie's tagline from the poster - ""Family Fights As One"".Netflix is the new 'Direct To Video' dumping ground for movies with some name stars in action, sci-fi, horror and revenge flicks. If you go into these things with relatively low expectations, you'll be satisfied I guess.",Sweet Girl

With this plot one could get 7/10 by doing everything fine.But the characters are just non-believable. The daughter is the worst. It's just inconsistent at actions: scared at second one, just to become bossy in the other, to do a naive stupid thing in a third, to say something rational in fourth. And why heavy makeup? Maybe the edges could be smoothened, but the actress didn't seem to try doing so.Policeman fighting for justice, merciless hired gun with his own kind of honor, a voice of morality who keeps being engajed into bad things, but never do ""the thing"" until the last moment. As if all action movie cliches were united in one movie, but instead of impression of complexity and multi-sided story, you only get a feeling how shallow it is.Conclusion:
Only watch as a background noise when doing things on the household.",Sweet Girl

198,tony-146-695626,yes worth watching and no it will not win an oscar for anything,7,23 August 2021,"In short its a good popcorn movie with unexpected twists. Though without Momoa score would be 5.5 . I could watch the man paint a fence with no complaints. My man!The long: Its not an action movie. It is presented as such,and you would not be blamed for expecting a Steven Seagal type of movie. It is not. It is a character study with issues from todays headlines, such as over pricing of life saving meds. A medicine that costs 7 dollars to make selling for over a $1,000. Remember Martin Shkreli, founder and chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals? Who jacked up the price of the life saving med from $14 to $750? Like that.You will see aside of Momoa that is not seen in Avengers movies. Its pretty cool and enjoyable. Isabel Merced who plays his daughter did an excellent job with her role. Solid acting.The ONLY weakness in casting is the fbi officer, played by Lex Davis. She does not come across as a tought fbi anything. More as a caring school crossing guard. I blame the caster, not the actress. But because it is hard to believe her role and actions, it tends to break the immersion. If it had been caster better and given move believable dialogue and actions, the movie could have been an 8.Last, there is some action. Not all of it comes across as authentic, not because of choreography, but because it does not always make sense. What action it has is ok. Nothing to brag about. John Wick it ain't.But worth a watch!",Sweet Girl

207,bradersl7,Just another basic Netflix addition,4,8 September 2021,"Honestly didn't expect too much from this but when Netflix said ""it's a thriller film like ""Taken"". Then I was like ahh I'll give it a go!It started off quickly with Momoa jumping off the roof of a stadium and it essentially goes back in time to the death off Amanda (Momoa's Wife) and a threat going out to the CEO of a pharmaceutical company. This is how all amazing films atart! Of course it then comes up with ""6 months later"" (one of my pet peeves for films, stop telling me about it and let me work it out) and Momoa has to meet a journalist who thinks he can bring down the pharmaceutical company, he then gets killed on the train by a hitman and Momoa fights the hitman who ends up stabbing Momoa, his daughter (Rachel) also gets thrown around like a rag doll. Even though there are probably cameras on the trains and stations and eye witnesses the hitman is never caught?Then another ""2 years later"" comes up. Yay! Momoa who recovers from hit stab wound then attends an event and ends up killing the CEO and his bodyguard (with an non-silenced gun and no one hears, like at all?). Anyway Momoa and his Rachel then go on the run and 2 other hitmen find them both straight away even though it was ""90 miles away"" and Momoa then kills both of them as well?!Momoa and Rachel are also after another guy from the same pharmaceutical company and the original hitman (from the train) ends up killing him because he is protecting his boss (a senator).Both Momoa and Rachel then travel back to go and get the senator. This is when the scene on the stadium happens and it turns out that Momoa died when he got stabbed on the train and it has been Rachel who has been doing all the killing and hunting people etc. That's right a 18 killed 2 trained hitmen 1 trained bodyguard and a CEO, she jumped off the roof of the stadium and landed in the river below where she was taken into an ambulance and outmuscled an FBI agent 2 paramedics and crashed the ambulance where she then just walked out?Rachel then appears at the senators rally and then inside her office and later kills the original hitman (from the train). Gets a recording of the senator saying that she took bribes and ordered hits on people and sends it to the FBI and Rachel then gets on a plane to enjoy her life.Either the FBI, Police and all authorities are just terrible at their jobs or she is secretly a spy that is just awesome at killing and covert missions. It's just so hard to believe that it's either and it's just poor writing. It's just not a good film like at all, it's 2 hours long and I have no idea where those 2 hours were, they tried to add a twist in there to make it interesting but it just made it even more stupid.",Sweet Girl
208,MovieWatcher2021,Amazing movie without any boring pieces,10,29 August 2021,"Sometimes, it is mind boggling that some users would give a crappy movie higher star ratings than a really good one. This movie is amazing. There aren't many actors, but if we consider some aspects of the movie, we'll know why it's a good movie:a. Acting: everyone acted amazingly, even the little girl. We know she was Dora and always thought she'd act in similar role, but she did really well, especially at the last few scenes. Mamoa is good actor anyway, everyone of them were carefully chosen and did a great job.B. Cinematics: Yes, it's an action movie, considering that the cinematics was great, I didn't see any lack of effort there.C. Story: it is ok to have a simple story, as long as the whole movies enjoyable. If someone wants a good story, go for Green Mile or Phantom of Opera, stop looking for Shakespeare in action movies.That's all, if someone wants to see a crappy movie, wait for Cinderalla from Prime, it's the worst Woke movie, next to Green Knight (where an Indian was a knight in white mideaval society!).",Sweet Girl

It is DUMB.I dont have issues with it not being realistic (yeah, like most movies are) or even with the issues related to the fighting scenes.The problem is : THE PLOT IS DUMB. Really dumb.If it is for the fighting, or the girl power.. Better go watch ""Kate"". Now thats a lot of action, blood, and a better plot.(i had to watch something else to wash off the bitter taste of ""Sweet girl"")",Sweet Girl

Jason did so well in the first scenes at the hospital, such natural show of feelings.This isn't clearly a movie for his abilities and looks but he performed tremendously.

She is not Gina Carano or even Rondon Rousey, these are MMA fighter. Then it's possible. The whole fbi can't catch a girl and got the chance to escape!. A wanted killer could catch a flight with no disguise. Driving heavy vehicles, lifting roadsides are heavy & yet still walking around with a Teddy bear. Enjoyed the film until the fbi lady asked her to speak her name then the film has flaw. It's OK film if there's nothing else to watch on the tele.

215,john-lancia-1,Now we know why Netfli got rid of its in house rating system,1,22 August 2021,"Total trash. Starts of as a mediocre action flick and then they 'twist' comes into play and I actually got mad. Something that I don't usually do when I watch middle of the road movies like this. Script writing this horrendous is all too common in these dark streaming times we live in. Honestly, how does a turd like this get the green light?!Jason Momoa is wooden as usual, its cringe worthy when he tries to emote. The girls role is moronic Puh-leez, watching 90 pound girls throw 200 pound trained guards and assassins around and kill them is too much for my suspension of diselief to withstand. That is pure fantasy and has nothing to do with female empowerment. It is a ham-fisted attempt at playing to the femail empowerment movement that is going on right now.Anyone giving this movie over a five is most likely working for Netfli in house review influencing department. Or a complete moron.",Sweet Girl

220,LivingWitness,A bland execution of a good idea,6,20 August 2021,"The best way to describe Sweet Girl is that it's a fairly standard action-thriller that's meant as a jab at the for-profit pharmaceutical industry.Generally, it was kind of slow to start with when they were setting up the motivations for Jason Mamoa's character. I feel like this could have been set up in half the time or less and most people would have been able to follow along and sympathise with his motivations.It also doesn't help that, due to the limitations of the script and possibly the director, Momoa doesn't provide a good dramatic performance here. His strength is in the action sequences, which is where more focus needed to be.I also feel like Sweet Girl would have benefited from just being played straight, without the twist in the last half-hour. That just felt a little cheap to me; as if the movie wanted to come off as being edgier than it really is. The thing is that twists like that haven't been edgy in at least fifteen years, and realistically, they haven't been edgy in more like twenty years. Today, they're mostly just tacky and forced.It's kind of a shame that this movie is like this, because I think there is a good movie hidden away somewhere underneath all of this. It's just that this was a kinda bland execution of a good idea.",Sweet Girl
221,alglasser-53401,Not the Best Netflix has Offered,4,23 August 2021,"Netflix spared all expense with this low budget B movie experience. Had this film been made in 1985 they likely would have cast Steven Segal rather than Jason Momoa. The movie had all the hallmark traits of a Segal revenge flick. A paper thin plot, bad acting, and a villain who's bad because the hero needed someone to beat up. All that was missing is an awesome catch phrase like : ""One thought he was invincible, the other thought he could fly. They were both wrong!""The movie did a good job of showing Pittsburgh in 4K, and for yinzers that may make it worth a look. It wasn't quite ""Sudden Death"" good, but they give you the tour of PNC park.The ending was totally lifted from Fight Club. The first rule of Sweet Girl is, you don't talk about Sweet Girl! It's like the writers were just clipping pieces of prior scripts hoping to mash together something that works. Like scrapbook film making.Sorry ladies the only thing chiseled out of wood in this film is Momoa's acting. His abs stayed under a shirt, so save your time 🤣. This movie is mostly garbage. But I've seen worse. I think. Pass on it unless you can't resist seeing the steel city on Netflix.",Sweet Girl
222,marineprincess,Jason just being hot isn't enough to film.,1,22 August 2021,This movie is awful. Just because an actor is well liked doesn't mean a film will be good. He's something to look at on Netflix this afternoon but this movie is awful.I feel like he's even done this role before in the same type of background. It's boring. It's just another thing to see Jason Momoa in. Nothing entertaining or crowd pleasing. It's just slow burning and a waste of time.,Sweet Girl
223,joeynos,Maybe Worth the long wait?,6,12 September 2021,"First off, Unless I got caught up in the moment and off guard , I did not see the ending coming and so perhaps worth watching.Now the bad parts, the storyline was way thin and the movie itself slow and perhaps a tad long. The good parts were Momoa did a fine job and finally showing off his acting chops beyond his grimaces and muscles. Secondly, I thought the fight scenes were well choreographed.Verdict? You'll have to decided.",Sweet Girl
224,MoviePeek,Room for improvement...,4,18 October 2021,"There are films that change your life forever, in ways you never could imagine. The richness of their stories and the journeys undertaken by their characters change you forever, there is no way to un-flip the switch and from that point forward everything is simply different. There are also films that you don't watch, so much as you endure them like some sadistic torture used in medieval times to extract information from a fallen brave knight of the realm. Lastly and perhaps leastly there are films that fail to hold the attention of your senses, like a weakly scented perfume and you can't help but contemplate more exciting concepts and make shopping lists in your head for your big weekly shop tomorrow. That reminds me I must get some scotch eggs. That's where Sweet Girl comes into the picture.Following in the footsteps of Liam Neeson and other actors, Jason Momoa dips his toe into the ever-expanding genre of action revenge rampage dad flicks. This time around the Pops in question is working his way up the chain of command to get to the top dog of a pharmaceutical company after the death of his wife who was unable to get a life-saving drug after they hiked the price up. The premise is timely and captures the plight of many families, on paper at least Sweet Girl makes for a film that is a cut above many of its contemporaries and may have some relevant social commentary to offer.But the truth is that Sweet Girl simply does not. This is largely due to the dunderheaded script and characters that make a four-year-old's pavement chalk drawing of a wabbit look three-dimensional. Okay maybe there're not that bad and I'm obviously being hyperbolic but sufficed to say they are not complex or interesting for that matter. Let's start with Ray Cooper, played by Jason Momoa, he's the ultimate working-class joe. His wife is dying and he's working three jobs just to keep up with the bills, on top of all that he's got a daughter to look after. He's got a lot on his plate, but who cares? What is his personality? Well, the truth of the matter is he doesn't have one. He's a hard-working devoted father and husband. That's all well and good but I don't care. He's not interesting, and no matter how many X-Factor sob stories you Frankenstein together I still don't. You can try to emotionally manipulate the audience all you want, but that doesn't mean that have to care.To add insult to injury the film's incredibly earnest and serious tone does absolutely nothing to help things. Like a cheap ice-cream parlor, the film fills every sequence with scoop after scoop of serious dower-faced scenes. Every film needs stakes and for the characters to take those stakes seriously, but they also need to remember that they are real people in an impossible situation, and should react accordingly. A joke or two wouldn't have gone amiss is what I'm trying to say.Next up on my chopping block is Ray's daughter, Rachel Cooper, played by Isabela Merced. Being a teenaged girl Rachel displays far more fear and trepidation about the sicky wicket she and her father find themselves in. She's often scared and frequently tearful. For me was believable and Isabela does a lot with a little. If only Ray was a more complex character, she would have had something to bounce off and the dynamic would be far more compelling. Given that this is ultimately a story about the bond between a father and a daughter their relationship really needed some more work. There's nothing out and out wrong with them, but their connection doesn't feel real.Ultimately Ray should have been more vulnerable, a working-class man way way way out of depth risking everything to avenge his wife and God knows who many more people who have been affected similarly. All this is resting on his shoulders, but you really don't get a sense of any of that. He should be freaking out; he should be breaking down. He should be sobbing.While watching Sweet Girl I was more than happy to forgive most of its shortcomings and give the film the benefit of the doubt, this is after all a film on Netflix. But, without giving anything away a moment at the end of the second act (you'll know it when it happens) really rubbed me the wrong way and made me, quite frankly irritated. Your mileage may vary with this moment, but for me, it does not work, and it does not feel earned. It felt cheap and nonsensical.All in all, Sweet Girl is by no means a terrible film, the idea is solid enough, with Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced doing their very best with their limited characters. If you're after something casual to have on in the background Sweet Girl is perfectly serviceable and will pass the time well enough. But if you're after a flick that will make you feel, well anything there are probably better options for your evening's entertainment.",Sweet Girl

But it started out as an ok revenge action flick and then made a bizarre abrupt wtf detour into unconvincing psychological horror movie and then degenerated into mindless unbelievable cliches as if the producers realized what a mess it had become and simply wanted to end production asap! I'm guessing there was some sort of conflict between film makers and nobody could agree on what direction to take with the production and so it drunkenly went in several directions and coherence was completely lost.SPOILER ALERT: The big ludicrous reveal in the movie is that Momoa's character Ray had actually died early in the movie and the movie's subsequent action scenes of Ray killing the bad guys were actually IMAGINED by his daughter Rachel after she had had a psychological break and ""became"" him in her mind as she did much of the action killing of the bad guys! In other words, she had a split personality: herself and that of her father! Part of the problem is that the movie does a poor job of ""selling"" that a small teenage girl was able to do the giant Momoa size killings. The movie conveniently wraps by having Rachel force a recorded confession from the main bad lady and then casually and inexplicably escaping aboard a commercial airliner despite being wanted for multiple murders by the police!",Sweet Girl

How many stupid plot points and how many bits of ridiculous dialogue can one movie have?I dunno, but this flic should be the benchmark against which all others are measured. The breadth and scope of the inanity on display here is breathtaking.Incredibly, somehow I do not regret the obliteration of my precious life-fluid which viewing ""Sweet Girl"" has caused.

At that point I turned the movie off, and I honestly don't care how it ends. This movie is supposed to be grounded in REALITY and at the point where you tell me that it wasn't the 220lb man in Jason Mamoa, but this 85lb teenage girl throwing these professionally trained body guards and assassins around and beating them in physical confrontations. NO, NO, just HELL NO. I can only suspend disbelief so far and this just isn't reality. If you told me I was watching a science fiction movie from the start maybe I would've been prepared for this, but you want me to believe that this is actually possible.

Now don't get me wrong, this is an award winning film, but it is engaging and the premise has a twist that I did NOT see coming. It's worth your time if you have extra and I almost made the mistake of skipping it based solely on these negative reviews.

Then it made more sense in the end, so I think I think I knew all along. Sweet girl as a title kinda sucks because she was called that maybe twice, but you find out she's the total opposite.There's things that make you say ""yeah right"", but I don't dwell on movies making every single thing accurate.

So Ridiculous!! And how the hell does she know how to hijack cars and use guns when she has never done it here. And where the hell is she getting money to fill gas and get in a cab. Should have stuck with Jason Mamoa doing all that stuff instead cuz the movie wasn't as great anyway but still watchable with him (he's the only reason I'm giving this some stars) but after that reveal it was so dumb!

The movie needed a bit more of him.But overall what mattered was the twist... I cried...PS: No action movie i have ever watched where realistic not even the ones that tried. So why people complain about realism in action movies buffles me. There's just grounded action movies and over the top action movies. Neither are realistic.",Sweet Girl
307,jayenjr,So-so actioner saved by twist,6,9 October 2021,"I like Jason Momoa. To me, he fits in right up there with The Rock - an action hero with decent acting chops. Plus, there's screen presence. While Rock has pretty much made a name for himself as an actor who can carry the weight of movies upon his shoulders, this still remains to be seen for Jason. Despite the success of his DC made entries, the rest of movies he headlined have meandered around poor box office success (think Braven). I doubt Sweet Girl would reverse that. In Sweet Girl, while Momoa wears that I'm-your-average-Joe-actionman badge as in Braven, the plot of Sweet Girl is patchy. Part of this has to do with the sterile acting from the supporting cast. There's just nothing to connect them with the audience, other than what feels like a play-by-numbers by unknowns. Even veteran Amy Brenneman looks one dimensional in her delivery, albeit she doesn't occupy considerable screen time. My caveat though, is Isabella Merced. She delivers enough emotional weight & does her action scenes believably. And has enough chemistry with Momoa to support the movie, but just barely.That's because the rest of the movie is let down by the delivery of its plotline. It drags itself from scene to scene, which is compounded by time fast forwards that felt like the director was doing it on purpose with the sole intent of simply skipping to the next thing on the script.The saving grace for me though, was the twist at the ending. Without it, I'd only score a 5. At the same time I wondered after the ending, was the plot made to feel drabby because of the twist? Having said that, while I'd think the twist could rank alongside some of the better movies twists of past years, yet, I can't help but wonder about the scientific reasoning behind it. There's no explanation as to the why.The action scenes were often near misses, only to be rescued by the last half an hour, which to me had a more purposeful delivery than to merely occupy the plot for the sake of occupying it.I do hope that both Momoa & Merced get better vehicles in future. They certainly have enough talent to deserve that much.",Sweet Girl

He seems like a genuinely likable guy, and he has a great potential for action movies, due to his physicality. Here, unfortunately, his character becomes a bit of a dud by the end, as the movie goes out of its way to sideline him as a character, in favor of his co-star.Isabela Merced was great in Sicario: Day of the Soldado and will surely have a great career if she wants to. Here, however, she is just OK, but it's not necessarily her fault. She plays the character as it's written.When it comes to acting, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is the standout performer here. His hitman has great potential as a bad guy, with some scene-stealing moments, but is sadly wasted by the end.Unfortunately, the twist in the third act mostly destroyed the movie for me. I just didn't buy it. Suspension of disbelief in a superhero movie is one thing, but when a grounded movie suddenly ignores physics and continuity, breaking the rules set within its own world, I get annoyed.

337,Rage_Dump,Where is everyone?,1,28 August 2021,"*Heavy Spoilers*I could not complete the movie, I could only get to the halfway point. It got too frustrating to watch. This movie takes place in a complete vacuum. Here's the breakdown:There's an assassination, then a fight to the death with the assassin on a crowded subway. These dudes wrestle around and bust through glass, while the subway tram kindly waits for their fight to end before moving again. There's not a single soul nearby, despite being crowded moments before the fight.Next main guy decides he's gonna go beat up the evil pharm guy. He musters all his cunning to sneak into a charity banquet as if he's James Bond. Somehow he gets a waiter uniform his size, finds a hair stylist to get the perfect manbun, and blocks off the MAIN RESTROOM with an out of order sign. Now with the ridiculous trap set, he'll purposely dump wine on the evil dude and walk away normally, going somehow unnoticed by everyone, despite being several feet taller and wider than everyone there. Now the ghost town theme returns as he ambushes the evil guy trying to use the MAIN RESTROOM, takes the fight to an adjacent hallway, and ends up with a gun going off. Not a single soul from the entire party sees or hears this until later when bodyguard 1 comes back from being unconscious.Next the main guy and his overly teenage daughter flee to somewhere in Canada maybe? It's not quite clear. But they end up at some motel where the only person there is apparently the front desk lady. Using the power of the ghost town theme, he sets up jingle bells in the MAIN HALLWAY so he can hear them if the MAIN DOOR is opened. Since not a single soul lives, rents, or even cleans this motel, he can rest easy knowing his alarm is only going to go off when there's a threat of an assassin. This of course works like a charm and his ingenious alarm of a couple jingle bells hanging down the hall from his motel room wake him from a dead sleep, and the fight is on. It's a loud fight with many gunshots and an eventual window break/car crash, but nobody's around to care! Even the daughter doesn't care. She literally moves outside and stands at the side of the road with her arms crossed waiting expectantly for the fight to the death to wrap up already. Later, the FBI gets a hot tip from a ghost who saw the whole thing.Then we come to the part where I had to stop watching:While fleeing/finding a new place to hide, main guy says ""welp, here looks like a great spot to drive into the woods and hide out."" He then uses the power of the ghost town again to cut a tree down to block a main road, and move some construction barriers around. Don't worry, nobody will come along to move or report these things. Main guy then consults the scrolls and determines his next target happens to live nearby his road barrier, and he divines that the evil guy will be taking his convoy down this very road tonight! None of this is explained or shown, so we have to assume he's psychic or something. Main guy then manages to get the convoy stuck in his trap and comes in out of nowhere with a big ol construction vehicle that I guess we're supposed to assume the nonexistent crew left unattended, unsecured, and with keys in it. Then subway assassin guy makes his return by shooting comically explosive shotgun bullets at the convoy as well, destroying it for some reason. Main dude gets freaked out by assassin rival and flees.This is where I had to turn it off. There was still 45 mins left, which actually made me laugh out loud at the sheer absurdity. The main dude is the world's worst brawler, has a ""code"" where using guns is morally wrong, and has an insufferable teen daughter who can't stop crying or being dramatic. All of his wile-e-coyote plans end up with him in a brawl while there are ZERO onlookers.I have no intention on ever watching the last 45 minutes, but I think the only way this movie could pull itself out of this awful writing is to reveal a twist where it turns out the main guy is actually capable of entering the shadow realm every time he tackles someone, and while he's there he gets psychic visions on what exactly to do next.",Sweet Girl

341,smileyy-50477,Terrible,3,23 August 2021,"This film had a lot of promise, only to be let down by poor writing and an awful ending. It is a shame on
Jason Mamoa as he didn't particularly do anything wrong in this flick.Isabela Merced was awful, probably one of the worst I've watched this year. The saving grace was Sarah Meeker.The writing was the main problem for the low score. The actions of the characters were usually wrong and dumb. The ending was meant to be a big shock but ended up falling flat on its face. The real ending should have been the daughter sadly passing away (and we find out at the end), Jason Mamoa falling through depression and fighting for justice for his 'sweet girl'.",Sweet Girl
342,perryman-65758,MMA at a local gym = Military combat and survival training......apparently,5,18 October 2021,"I watched this film because I got suckered in by the little trailer that plays before you select the movie on netflix.Boy was I fooled.The film stars Jason Momoa as a family man who seeks revenge bascially on a big pharma company who is responsible for his wife's death. I did really feel the character and story building at the start. I could feel the hope and then the despair as the hope is snatched away. You are left to deal with a slowly dieing loved one and you can't do anything to save them. All for corporate greed.This is in part due to Momoa. He does a great job here at being that intense alpha male that he always does, mixed with being a really soft family man who deeply loves his wife and daughter and we see some really strong acting and character work at the start. We then see the bond between his character Ray and his daughter become even stronger as they both try to continue life after their loss.Not sure where the film was shot but ir does have a really cold gritty dark feeling which is very welcome.......And then then the silliness begins. Usually with these type of films when you have a lone person going around beating up, and outsmarting the FBI, trained bodyguards and armed mercenaries with full tactical gear, with just their bare hands. Usually the character has some sort of extensive military background and survival training to give some sort of rationale. The rationalse here.......is MMA just MMA from a local gym, nothing else. This is what really breaks the film.This is before we even get to the twist everyone has been mentioning.This just sends the film from being incomprehensible to really incomprehensible. I felt that the twist was the true way the director wanted to go with the film from the start. But I felt that if they did that they knew that most people would turn off immediately because it would have made the film silly right from the start..",Sweet Girl
343,sinopa-09617,A major disappointment,1,21 August 2021,"The plot and last minute twist of this movie falls flat as there is little to no character development, the delivery is underwhelming and the story completely unrealistic. The side developments of the no-named character/bystanders throughout the movie either behave in unrealistic manners or due to bad directing, don't have cuts/bruises, are off mark in fights, etc. The title character also is lacking. Essentially Rachel is written as a child of a young age. From her mannerisms to how she talks, there is no maturity there. It's stated she is 18, but the writers either don't know how a 18 year old woman acts or suck as writers. Jason Mamoa's character falls flat and while his character is the main vehicle to drive the plot for over half the movie, it leaves the viewer bored and checking to see when the movie will be over. There are many unrealistic inconsistencies such as the easily lifting of government badges or not hitting the break in a car when someone is trying to control the steering wheel. More than once I yelled come on! All in all, the plot twist is on par with a bad M Night Shamylan movie crossed with a Steven Segall movie.",Sweet Girl

Although this was an action film it had more emotional depth than your average action thriller. Anyone who has seen Momoa in Road to Paloma or Red Road knows he's got a big emotional range which he doesn't always get a chance to show. Well he did in Sweet Girl. There's a scene near the beginning that really showcased his ability. It was moving and I'd like to see more of this from him in future projects.The action was well choreographer, well filmed and well performed. Very slick and I would have expected nothing less. The plot is not your average revenge plot and there is a twist that was so shocking I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours afterwards. I watched it again knowing the twist to see if there were clues that I missed and there were but they were subtle.I'd recommend this film to anyone who likes a good action thriller that's just a little bit different.

I came into it thinking that him taking a more grounded role would be interesting to see and honestly this movie had an interesting premise of a grief stricken man fighting back against the greedy corporation who recalled the medicine that would have kept his dying wife alive.The action scenes are well done and looked really cool. I liked the casting and the characters were really believable until the third act and it was a pleasant watch for the most part. The atmosphere was tense, you really felt for these two who were fighting against entities more powerful than them and I rooted for Jason and his co-star to get their revenge, but then the twist happened.I will say the small seeds of foreshadowing were there, it was a little cryptic but I must say that it was such an out of left field twist that I was a little surprised by, but then it made no sense upon further thinking.So you mean to tell me that Momoa is actually not the lead and that his daughter was the one who's been fighting men twice her size with guns and weapons, because of some mental disorder that made us think he was the one doing all of this, when it was just her trying to cope and avenge her fallen dad, who dies near the beginning.It made a lot of sense with the title, but I really dislike when twists are thrown in just to shock you and not to enhance the narrative. So you mean to tell me that this girl was able to kill all these highly trained guards, assassins and even evade police capture multiple times, all because of a sense of revenge and some editing choices that obfuscated who was the real protagonist??I'm sorry but why was this twist necessary? You might as well not have casted Momoa in the first place, oh wait then that'd mean the movie would get less attention and notoriety. I dislike how deceptive this plot was, because what was the point of showing the daughter wanting her dad to stop while he's ahead, when she knows full well that she's the one doing all of this, and why is she even talking with the FBI agents after her, if she's so hellbent on revenge? It makes no sense that she's bringing in obstacles to obstruct her goal.I feel like the twist unravels the plot holes even more, and also isn't getting a confession out of someone under duress illegal or inadmissible as evidence since the congresswoman big bad was being threatened?I'm just baffled that they got a big name like Momoa, only to shaft him and make him a bit player for his co-star daughter who's previous development was squandered, since she was meant to be an emotional crutch for Momoa, but what was even the point of the scenes with him and his daughter if it was all a long con delusion brought on by PTSD and grief??Such an interesting concept but it was executed poorly. It had its good moments, but the twist ruined everything with its deceptive marketing, forced character development, lazy pacing, unrealistic scenarios and cheap twists.",Sweet Girl

There is a part in the movie where Jason Momoa's character finds the pharma guy and proceeds to try to kill him. Keep in mind he had promised the guy (on a phone call filmed for live TV) he would find and kill him. Momoa's wife died of cancer apparently because pharma guy pulled an experimental drug off the market. Anyway, Momoa finds this guy in a bathroom at a hitel or something and tries to kill him. Pharma guys security team decide to do what security teams are suposed to do and protect their man from a murderous maniac. During the process of trying to save the life of Pharma guy one of the security guys gets shot in the head by Momoa. Momoa was fighting with one of the other guys and started wrestling for the gun and the gun went off killing the security guard. Well in a follow up scene we are told Momoa is inmocent because he was just trying to defend himself! Really? So we are supposed to believe that a person who tries to murder an innocent person (the pharma guy hadnt done anything wrong up to this point) and a security team tries to defend their client, THEY are in the wrong? Was the security team supposed to have just stood by and watched? The later twist in the movie doesn't do anything to help this scene either. Momoa without questions is the bad guy in this one. He killed someones son, father, friend for doing what they were legally and morally supposed to do! The security team had no idea who he was other than a murderous lunatic trying to kill their client! This happened fairly early in the movie and sets the tone for the stupidity that is to come.",Sweet Girl

Once the plot twist came along, it instantly dropped to a 4/10 if I am being generous. Watching Jason Momoa's character get manhandled by men half his size during most of the movie seemed preposterous. Once the plot twist came along at least that much made sense. The concept was not atrociously terrible. Someone taking on big pharma, a revenge story, a strong and empowered female. What's not to like? How about the delivery, some of the casting, the execution, etc. When Isabella Merced and Lex Scott Davis would deliver some of their lines you could easily tell they were not buying into what it was they were saying. They both had incredibly important roles and yet they were translucent. It felt as though once Jason Momoa's name was attached to the film almost everyone else gave up and decided they did not need to try because they Jason Momoa in the film. He was certainly the draw for most. Despite what his stature may lead you to believe, he is unable of carrying an entire film on his back. Skip this movie.

Nothing but nothing could convince me that a girl who is about 5ft 2 with no real training (she's not a super soldier or anything or an X-Man) could win a fight with me, let alone a ""hit man"" who is supposed to protect a senator. It goes beyond the realms of belief. Also, like in many films, Rachel is willing to kill random people who are pretty much innocent but when she gets to the big baddy she doesn't kill her. So in the end the kid is just some messed up failure. A train wreck of a film that would have been much worse had the decent cast not managed to salvage something from Brian Andrew Mendoza weak debut.

Especially, since his GOT days where you got a glimpse of it.The twist near the end makes the viewer look at it again and it did make sense in regards to certain details that is revealed throughout the movie.

433,catyjes,The only positive about this movie is that my nails are done💅,2,20 August 2021,"One of the most boring movies I've watched in a very very long time. Script was really bad and made no sense, characters were flat and unbelievable, dialogue was horrible (which belongs to the script, I know, but I just had to name it again), police incompetent to do their job right, and action scenes didn't make up for 95% of the rest that's missing, among others. I like Jason Momoa but I prefer watching Aquaman again instead of giving this movie another try (fyi, I don't like Marvel movies). Half of the movie, i was wondering why they called it ""Sweet girl"" instead of ""widower wages a senseless vendetta"", I didn't count the times I checked my watch as I couldn't wait the movie to be finished. I knew from the beginning who the real villain was and the ""not so surprising"" twist didn't help the movie as I couldn't care less at this point of the movie that the person going nuts is just one step away. They lost me quite from the beginning and somehow I'm glad I jumped off the running train that's going to crash a wall. Seriously, what's the message of this movie? I understand the pain and anger of the protagonist but still, there's not reasonable justification for the following (brutal) choices/ actions. Therefore, the end is totally weak and not plausible. For me, it seems like a movie that was being made during one of the Corona lockdowns, with a script written in a hurry and many regulations preventing scenes to be produced adequately. I just know that my time is precious and movies like these need to come with a ""wasting time"" warning.",Sweet Girl

She is only 20 but looks about 14 and is known for playing Dora the explorer but it turns out she can break the neck of ex military fully grown men without any trouble.As soon as this happened I did let out a grown but ended up just laughing and wondering when movie studios will stop this nonsense.We'll probably all be called sexist for pointing this out but it is what it is.,Sweet Girl

I found myself yelling at the screen - pull the camera back! So many hand held close ups. Mount the camera and stop trying to be fancy!Many times the story just was not told well. Jumping around years and months. Backwards and forwards. Just tell a linear narrative.Such a shame - love Jason Mamoa - he played his part well.

Could be a movie of the week for the liberal crowd as it clearly supports progressive values such as Universal Healthcare and healthcare as a human right. This may explain some of the rabidly negative reviews. The action was no more unbelievable than Aquaman or any James Bond film. The twist at the end of the film was a good one.

Unless it s in the movie 'kick ass', but they don't take themselves seriously at all... I mean, this assassin literally killed Jason Mamoa and another guy in the train while the girl was also trying to get him, how the fribbs does that same girl kill that same guy 24 months after... Did she become stronger than her beast AF dad within that time period? How? I want to know, wouldn't mind trying that shit myself.

The action is non-stop and the plot twist at the end will really hit hard.I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film, but who can't say no to a movie starring Momoa and up and coming star Isabel Merced. She is a tour de force in her role as Rachel, and what can be said about Momoa, he sure is spreading his wings in the roles he takes and this was no exception.This film kept me glued to my seat and kept me guessing all the way until the end when the writers literally pull the blindfold off your eyes and reveal the great plot twist.

Not Oscar worthy but very watchable. Expecting us to believe that Dora the explorer was able to take all the big bearded gun toting bad guys on because her dad taught her how to fight? Absolutely nonsense. Not in a good way nonsense like the superhero and sci-fi movies most of us love but just plain ol nonsense. Should have just kept it with Mamoa as the tough guy protecting his daughter. There was no reason or motivation to twist it that way that makes any sense to me. It seemed like whoever decided and approved that shamalan-esque plot twist did it just to do it with no reason what so ever other than to try and be edgy. Watch up until the last 30 mins then turn your tv off.,Sweet Girl

1. Very detailed narration of scenes for which director reveals the suspense in climax.For Eg : Before a scene where Ray Cooper ( Jason Momoa ) pours alcohol on to Siman Keeley you can clearly see Ray Cooper will be taking dress of women catterer. And through out movie though Ray Cooper being a giant man couldn't able to beat men properly which shows Ray Cooper is not strong enough as it is actually fought by his daughter in movie.2. Director tries to show Rachel Cooper is also a good fighter from the beginning of movie which justifies the climax sequence.3. Good background music with perfect screenplay is hightlights of this film.Must watch film for detailed freaks out there to enjoy action thriller.Please do not go with negative reviews as this was directed with lot of details to narrate a story.

I admit it doesn't have to be everyone's cup of tea, but that movie evoked some pretty strong feelings in me. I had goosebumps in some places.Story:
I loved that. It reminded me a little bit of The Last of Us Part II. It had that vibe even the final fight was happening in the water.It had strong motives as a stuffed rabbit called Paloma.That female politician bad-guy was cliché.I love the twist about her dad and her. I didn't expect that through that time I felt stunned.Cinematography:
That's why we go to the cinema or in this case watch streaming sites. It was handled well. I love the colors, compositions, and lights. I'm clapping to the Director of photography and his crew.In editing, especially when the chase in the stadium was going on, some parts felt kinda confusing.Acting:
It Wasn't bad.Score:
Somebody did a great job :)VFX:
It Wasn't the best one in the market.Let's sum it up. It was dope for me.Truthbomb in the end.The past is like a dream. A mosaic of images and feelings that offers some truth about how we got here, even if details have blurred with time

545,minttu-47746,"Clever movie with great action that's not too ""Hollywood"" in its style",9,5 November 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie. I had my reservations when it started with a scene from the present before jumping to the past, but oh boy was it there for a reason.I really got attached to this family, and I broke down along with Ray when they pronounced his wife was dead. I also liked the overarching theme - big pharma playing with lives to get the big money - and how the individual reporter was taken down after getting too close.I picked up first hint of the ""twist"" already when Rachel was boxing. A young adult, her skills referred to with such a nostalgic way in comparison to her dad - at first I thought Ray had been paralyzed by the attack. The next thing I picked up on was the clothes rack at the charity event - kind of laughed it of as the set crew placing the wrong title card on the rack.But little by little the feeling of ""something's wrong in here - Rachel isn't like herself - Ray's not like himself"" - started to play more and more into it, and it all made sense when we got back to the scene on the bridge and caught up with where the movie started.I've seen a couple of reviews going on about ""why would Rachel imagine her father, why would the assassin not be shocked there's a little girl after him"" - but C'mon. If you really have to ask that, you've never had to tangle with something that has turned your world upside down and makes you look for the safety net you don't have on the outside, on the inside. Does everything have to be spoonfed for the audience for it to be good? And to remind you, when Rachel goes for the manhunt, she's a young adult. If 14 year olds are mistaken for adults, then how about even older girls. For real.But yeah, I loved the movie and I am going to watch it again to pick up on all the things that made me think ""well something doesn't add up"" the first time around and to just enjoy some of the beautiful shots in the movie. And to see the amazing fight sequences. Especially the last fight - there was just something so down to earth but also epic in it and Isabella Merced did a great job with it! Jason was great as usual - it's so weird seeing how he changes the way he fights completely depending on the character, and I'll be taking notes on the first fight scene (Momoa, event) and last scene (Merced, the office roof) to try to find all the similarities in them.If you haven't watched the movie yet and your reading this - why did you read it even though it said spoilers? If you are just like me, enjoyed the movie, and are just tired of all the bad takes when it comes to the movie - then maybe you'll get a bit happier to see that you're not alone.",Sweet Girl

There are no words in the english language that accurately describe how brutally awful this ""movie"" is. The only good thing about this movie is that it inspired me to quit my job and travel the world spreading the word about how bad this movie is. If I can save just one person 2 hrs of their life than it's all worth it. Pick any other movie on Netflix. Go outside and watch cars go by. Go to bed have a nap.",Sweet Girl

587,jolando-73535,"Idk what's wrong with the haters, solid movie lovable characters",8,23 August 2021,"All around another good action movie produced by Netflix. All the haters are salty the plot twist was very interesting and honestly made this from a 5/10 to an 8/10. I'm being generous because Jason momoa carries the acting however good that a strong young female takes over, ending wrapped up nicely. For what it is, sweet girl is an all around good movie, can do with less emotional content in the beginning, however Jason momoa still shines.",Sweet Girl
588,croucher-21434,Was hoping for better,5,23 August 2021,"I was excited to watch this movie- Jason Mamoa takes on Big Pharma. I have to say that I was really let down. The plot of the movie was terrible, the plot twist was predictable, and the movie in general was not believable. With all of that said, I could watch Jason Mamoa fill out his taxes and I would be perfectly happy. Therefore, the movie earned some points for casting him.",Sweet Girl
589,funkyjose-18135,Pure garbage,1,23 August 2021,"I made my account on imdb for this movie. I want to say this is a pure garbage and I want my time back. I still cannot believe this kind of idea can be made in 2021. And with Jason Momoa? Whoever wrote this garbage, I want him or her burn in hell.",Sweet Girl
590,willlemon,the worst movie i've seen all year,1,23 August 2021,"An utter waste of time. The ""plot twist"" was probably one of the lamest, most laughable things they could have decided upon.

592,christopher_d_roberts,absolutely BRILLIANT !!,10,25 August 2021,Anyone who gives this great movie less than an 8 probably prefer the mutant ninja turtles or the Marvel comics dross. Sad people.An excellent script and very well executed by the excellent cast.,Sweet Girl
593,marmatzeinoun,VERY BAD,3,25 August 2021,"Even if it's just a movie, jumping from a stadium is

the most absurd.End the fact of making believe that his father was the hero strongly disappointed me.",Sweet Girl
594,krausitis,"It was okay, until it wasn't",1,25 August 2021,"After watching the movie i was not going to review it because it seemed to generic, after the horrible plot twist, i had to. The movie was mediocre at best during most it, the action scenes were meh, I don't really have a take on the acting because i don't notice it that much, but the twist at the end of the movie was horrible, a little girl, who's 5'5, beating up of a giant bodyguard, the most unrealistic thing i have ever seen, not to mention the way they reveled the twist, what were we watching the entire time??? It made me want to go back in time and never see the movie in the first place, if they didn't completely ruin it at the end, I probably would have given it a 5 or a 6, I most likely would have not written a review at all, but i definitely have to give it a 1 now. At least it made me write my first IMDB review.",Sweet Girl

One of the absolute worst movies I've watched in a looooong time.",Sweet Girl
596,kerpankatie,What a waste of talent,3,26 August 2021,"The plot and concept is overused. I felt there was no real thrill and the story lacked depth. Perhaps in 2011 this would be a hit, was expecting something more creative.",Sweet Girl

598,raduzamfir,"Not an Oscar movie, but ok for a Sunday afternoon",7,29 August 2021,"Basic and flat script until the great twist from the last third, that added 2-3 points to the overall rating...otherwise, it would be just a mediocre, ""the fugitive""-type movie, with barely above the average play of Jason Momoa... very curious to see him without famous beard and hair, any chance to happen sometime in this life?",Sweet Girl
599,tddsccy,Terrific,10,26 August 2021,I figured this movie would be just a typical fighting movie but it left me going Ohhhhhhhh snap! Theres are hints throughout the movie but you wont realize the connections until the end. Watch this and enjoy the emotional roller coaster.,Sweet Girl
600,jaztech-68341,Stupid 'twist' ruined the movie,4,27 August 2021,"Could have been a good, emotional, well thought out movie. Instead, the deceptive twist/lie rubbed the movie. Dishonest movie telling isn't clever. Not good. I'm sure they were trying to recreate Fight Club, but that led people to believe a certain thing, it didn't just lie about it.",Sweet Girl
601,rashad-19280,Terrible,1,27 August 2021,It was so terrible that they had to put a twist in the end trying to make it better. But that flopped as bad as the movie.,Sweet Girl

I really liked the story (refreshing, real problems, human psychology), it was a little bit mind blowing too(the twist), a lot of real emotions(mostly sadness and empathy, the weirdness/shock/invisible hormones in the middle).I actually enjoyed it (finally a good movie), great story!It wasn't a perfect movie, but thinking back, It may have been... 8+ for sure.",Sweet Girl

628,bojan-22-515658,Barely watchable due to camera and editing,3,22 August 2021,I'm not going to comment on the content itself. It's okayish - a but over the top but aligned with expectations for such a movie.But the camera keeps shaking constantly. As though it was held by a five year old who really needed to pee.Editing changes cameras unnecessarily every second and at weird times to weird angles so you have difficultly refocusing. Not really sure if they were just trying to annoy the viewer or were paid by a cut.Barely watchable.,Sweet Girl

Woke up to watch the finale fight scene.You'd expect me giving low rating since I dozed of. But that's my fault for working myself tired and watching it late at night. But overall it was decent. It'd give it 5.5 stars out of 10. I wasn't until several nights later I decided to watch what I missed.The action was very well choreographed and no way looked staged. The part that I missed blew my mind because it included a twist that was totally unexpected. With that missing 10 minutes or so, I'll change my rating to 9/10 for the surprise factor alone.",Sweet Girl

The story about a conspiracy behind the withdrawal of a drug and a revenge-seeking husband and daughter is very engaging, plus the twist at the end gives the script a great angle. Very entertaining from start to finish.Jason Momoa plays a great role at hurt husband and caring father.The worst is probably the excessive fighting which, later knowing carried out by a little girl, makes the plot feel unrealistic.",Sweet Girl

639,Phoenixphil1967,Not sure if everyone saw the same film...,1,30 August 2021,Simply put this is one of the worst most incoherent movies I've ever seen. Utterly implausible on every level. That's not to say it's implausible on a high concept level - virtually every Marvel film ever produced is that - I mean implausible on EVERY level - down to conversations between characters or the basic structuring of a getaway scene. I am baffled by its meta-critic score - I've not witnessed anything this bad in a very long time.,Sweet Girl
640,imortal-tom,Ignore the reviews,7,22 August 2021,"I don't get why this movie has so many bad reviews. It's not the best but is so far away from being the worst. The action was good and Jason momoa did a great job but Isabela Merced definitely stole the show.

The 2/10 is solely in recognition of Jason Mamoa and his charisma, but the dreadful writing and appalling secondary cast ensure you never feel like this is anything more than a film students first year project.",Sweet Girl

658,alanah-tesoriero,Escape from reality,7,25 August 2021,"As a current health worker in the crazy times of COVID it's nice to lose reality and escape.This movie provided me over an hour and a half of a break from real life stressors. Sure it had a few twists and the story took you in different directions but I'm not complaining. I'm thankful that they gauged my attention enough to forget about real life and focus on the story playing out infront of me.Have an open mind - watch for yourself and remeberber, anyone who rates something out of 10 less than a 2 is obviously a very hard to please person!",Sweet Girl
659,biscp,Ok but.......,6,22 August 2021,"Solid revenge film but tries too hard with the final twist which it could have done without as it just makes you question what you have watched. I mean you trained in a boxing gym, but now you are killing bodyguards?",Sweet Girl

661,esliger25,A film with more depth than I anticipated,7,21 August 2021,"When I watched this film I kind of expected it to be something like Taken or Home front where the main character had to save or protect his daughter from some bad people. I expected it to be a lot of fighting and shooting and just watching Jason Momoa beat up a bunch of people for 2 hours, ya know the usual.However even though it is first and foremost an action film it has a depth do it that not all action movies have, and the surprise twist in the last 30 minutes of the movie really cements that this is not your typical action film where you can just shut your brain off and watch guys punch each other. Even though it's not superbly executed this film does do its best to send a message and teach you something, and I and I personally think a film and I personally think of film is always much better if it attempts to teach you something rather than just simply trying to entertain you.While I did like this movie, it does have quite a few flaws in my opinion. The pacing is not very good for the first hour to an hour and a half of the movie. I personally think there were a lot of flaws with the writing, and it seems like a lot of work went into coming up with the plot twist but not making sure the rest of the story made sense. I I may be spoiling it a little bit but the plot twist itself has a major flaw in the fact that the two characters are very different sizes and and therefore they're fighting styles would be very different.The FBI agents in this movie are probably the most inept FBI agents I've ever seen on TV or they're just super realistic, either way they're not very good at their job. The lady agent has multiple phone conversations with a wanted homicide suspect and it doesn't seem like she tells any of her colleagues or her superiors about it which I have to think is super dumb and just doesn't make a whole lot of sense (also I may have docked this movie a whole star because of the male FBI agents mustache).I also thought the assassin and primary antagonist of this film was kind of underwhelming, even though they tried to shoe horn a tragic backstory during the diner scene It it really didn't make me feel bad for him at all in the primary issue with this is that if you don't have an antagonist that's imposing or leaves an impression, the final fight between the main character and the antagonist is usually underwhelming which in all honesty the final fight in this movie kind of was. I feel like I should also add that the whole thing with the politicians and the corrupt pharmaceutical company was not very well executed and could have been done a lot better.One final thing I want to add is that while Mamoa gave a great performance in this film, the best performance in this movie by far was definitely by Isabela Merced, her performance in this film was much better than I thought it was going to be and had they had a different actress it probably would not get seven stars from me because it relied a lot upon Merced's performance to sell the twist.",Sweet Girl

663,bunnymom34,"Could have been good, but a few thigns totally ruined it",2,23 August 2021,"1st off, why have an actress who is almost 15 play an 11 y/o girl? She doesn't even come close to passing for that age, it isn't needed for any part of the plot, nor does it make sense in any other way, esp given the rest of the movie supposedly takes place two yrs later: she would be 13 & is now played by a 20 y/o (sorry, but no 20 yr old passes for 13 - kids change way too much in that time frame & she definitely does not look or act 13) She could have pulled off 17, though, which would have fit with the younger one being 15.....plus, no 13 yo girl would be able to pull off any of the stuff she did as the ""older"" girl....had they actually made the younger girl 15 & the older one 17, both would not only have looked the ages they were supposed to be, but the driving, the action scenes, the stealing, the complicated plotting against all the others, etc would have been at least somewhat more realistic (still not really, but not near as absurd as it was).....plus, the plot twist towards the end was beyond ridiculous! Way to totally ruin what could have been a halfway decent, action movie.....zero plausibility as it is, though, even really stretching the bounds of possibilities.",Sweet Girl

680,shailesh-62921,Another Netflix Trash,4,4 October 2021,"I started watching this movie as I am a fan of Jason Momoa. This movie is a good watch for more than an hour but Man o Man, with one twist in the plot, it killed the entire movie.Movie was good till Jason Momoa was the main cast. It went horribly wrong when writer, for some unknown reason thought of making him a side character and instead gave his daughter all the screen space. I mean , really?????Also, It doesn't make sense when a straw like girl is tossing 250lbs dudes like paper.",Sweet Girl
681,monima-74062,I thought it was a great movie!,10,22 August 2021,I usually have a hard time finishing a whole movie. I either lose interest very quickly or I fall asleep but this movie had me hooked the entire time! I enjoyed it and will definitely watch it again! I will be telling my friends to watch it!!,Sweet Girl
682,jeremysutton-39020,"It was good, and it's a MOVIE",10,18 September 2021,So many haters in these rating comments. It was a solid movie with a pretty shocking twist. Give the movie a watch and decide for yourself.,Sweet Girl
683,yoods,What a full of cliche!!,2,20 August 2021,"Copy and paste the plot here and there
Try to look unique by making a sweet girl psychiatric patient who can fight like a mma champion.Jason,,,you gotta improve your eyes to filter out scripts from now on.Aquaman credit doesn't last long.",Sweet Girl
684,brawleyjoseph,Small budget slice of gold!,8,24 August 2021,"Lots of crazy talk about how bad this movie is, this that....yeah yeah. The truth is, if you are looking to chill and watch a movie that has good acting, solid directing and maximum value for the price. This is the movie. This film will keep engaged even if it's just for Jason Momoa who is great in this; but. The true star even at that is the daughter played by Isabela Merced. She was amazing. This is a good movie... that seems to have transported to a time where small production, low budget films could become legendary. This Director nails that hard. Best film possible all included from a low man.",Sweet Girl

687,kirschm,Pretty bad,2,21 August 2021,Wasted a Friday night watching this nonsense. My suspension of disbelief meter exploded in the first 10 minutes. Please do better next time.,Sweet Girl
688,amyakabrat,"Acting was good, but the overall script 👎👎",4,24 August 2021,"Started out okay, but then they start really getting into the film. The nonsensical things Mamoa's character was doing were driving me nuts. What parent would do these things to their child after losing one parent already? It just wasn't making sense. Still the action scenes were good and overall the acting was fine so I kept watching. Of course the plot twist explains this nonsensical behavior. But then despite being reasons behind the actions, the character would still need to answer for the crimes committed along the way right.... apparently not. Sigh.",Sweet Girl
