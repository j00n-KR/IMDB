0,Leofwine_draca,Intense slow-burning slice of Korean horror,7,6 April 2017,"THE WAILING is the third film in the career of Korean director Na Hong-jin and it's a very different beast to his first two, THE CHASER and THE YELLOW SEA. Both of those are among my favourite films of all times thanks to their breakneck action and intense thrills, whereas THE WAILING is much more old-fashioned, a slow-burning piece of atmospheric horror that's all about the mood and mystique rather than intensity and thrilling action.The film has a rural setting and sees the typically inept Korean police force attempting to make sense of weird deaths and the weird murderers committing them. Before long it becomes clear that an old Japanese hermit, played by yakuza film regular Jun Kunimura, is somehow connected to the deaths. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of sustained horror involving possession, curses, disease, rituals, and even some zombie mayhem. Some viewers might find the slow pace off-putting, but I found this film rewarding right up until the twist-upon-twist climax. It's exceptionally slow and features some stand-out sequences, like the zombie attack and the endless ritual. The performances are neatly-judged and the mystery keeps you guessing right until the end. It's a very interesting film, one made to reward repeat viewing.",The Wailing
1,claudio_carvalho,"Long, Melodramatic and Messy Ghost Story",5,14 December 2016,"In the small village Goksung in South Korea, police officer Jong-Goo (Do Won Kwak) investigates bizarre murders caused by a mysterious disease. His partner tells a gossip for him that a Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) that lives in a secluded house in the mountains would be an evil spirit responsible for the illness. Jong-Goo decides to visit the Japanese with his partner and a young priest that speaks Japanese. They find an altar with a goat head and pictures of the infected people that died on the walls. However they are attacked by the guard dog and they only can leave the place when the stranger arrives. Jong-Goo finds one shoe of his beloved daughter Hyo-jin (Hwan-hee Kim) in the house of the stranger and soon she becomes sick. His mother-in-law summons the shaman Il-gwang (Jung-min Hwang) to save her granddaughter while a mysterious woman tells Jong-Goo that the stranger is the responsible. Who might be the demon that is bringing sickness to Goksung?""Goksung"" is South Korean horror movie with a long, melodramatic and messy ghost story. Despite the promising and original premise, the screenplay is confused and maybe the translation is not totally correct. Or maybe the situations make sense in accordance with the South Korean culture. The conclusion is confused and it seems that Goksung is under attack of demons that wins the battle. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): Not Available.",The Wailing
2,kosmasp,Patience and (or) trust,10,21 June 2020,"Watching this, quite a few things may confuse you. The story is not easy at all. It is about good and evil though. It is about how we perceive the world and what we make of it. It is about many things, a lot of you may experience and see, that the person next to you may not see.The movie is made to be watched more than once. I had heard about the Wailing and how good it supposedly is - well now I can leave the supposedly part away. It is as good as people say it is. And it is another example of south korean filmmaking that not few see as a powerhouse in the world right now (some may argue it has been for quite some time now). This movie is another example for just that.It is also a movie about prejudice, about how small our world is and how we react to an outside ""influence"". How things collapse and what society is capable of ... again so many things to discover here. Now that being said, it doesn't mean you will like the movie. Or that if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have no taste in movies. That is the great thing about films. We all have different tastes and we all value things different. You may just want to see explosions. And that's more than fine. But it's not what you'll get here ... not for the weak hearted or squeamish just to be clear though ... this is brutal .. to watch!",The Wailing
3,paul_haakonsen,A very unpredictable movie...,6,15 October 2016,"""The Wailing"" (aka ""Goksung"") is a South Korean pseudo-horror movie, and that alone already counts well in favor for the movie, as South Korea has a long, and most impressive, track record for making horror movies. The movie runs a bit over two and a half hours, but it actually manages to remain interesting and captivating throughout the course of this time frame.The story is about a strange disease that spreads in a small rural settlement in South Korea. This disease causes rashes and blisters, and eventually drives the infected to kill those he or she loves in blind rage. A local policeman becomes involved in the case and finds himself deep in a very strange mystery, which involves supernatural elements and it is a race against time to find the culprit and the source of this bizarre sickness.I will say that the story is good and interesting, especially because director Hong-jin Na managed to build up the movie in such a way that the audience is given bits and pieces of information throughout the course of the movie, and thus keeps the audience in the dark and trying to put the pieces together themselves and trying to figure out who is the cause of it all.And just when you think you have it all figured out, something happens and the movie takes an unforeseen turn, which just further keeps the audience on edge and trying to make sense of it all. That was a nice thing in the movie, because it kept it from being predictable, and it forces the audience to actually do some thinking throughout the course of the movie.The acting in the movie was quite good, which is a common trait seen in South Korean movies, so there were no surprise there. As always it is an enjoyment to sit down and watch another South Korean movie.Without giving anything away, then I will say that just as I thought I had it all figured out, then the director opted for something else entirely towards the ending, and threw me fully of the trail. I had not seen that ending coming, not by a long shot. But, personally, I didn't care much for how the movie ended and the realization of what was really going on. It was just a bit too much, to far out there for my taste. Especially since the movie had been so good and intriguing up to that point. It just took a nosedive with that unveiling, and as such I am forced to rate the movie only a six out of ten stars rating.That being said, don't get me wrong, because ""The Wailing"" really is a good movie, it is just that I didn't enjoy the ending in the least bit. But if you enjoy Asian movies and South Korean movies in particular, then ""The Wailing"" is a solid horror/mystery movie which definitely is worth watching.",The Wailing
4,trashgang,not as gory as being told,7,29 July 2016,"Have seen that this was to be a gory flick and in someways it does but it also is a long flick and for some this will be a hard road to take. It's typical an Asian horror full of ghostly storytelling. And it do involve people who do change in some kind of zombified creature.The hardest parts to view are when the shaman is coming in and some rituals are performed to curse out the demon. It is a long sequence and so typical Asian that if you aren't fond of their way of living you will again could be forced to turn it off. It isn't naturally not all that bad, the story is easy to follow and the main character is slowly transferred into the world of possession. Not as gory as being told but it does have good effects to show the possession or the virus changing people. It's up to you to decide what it is.

5,christopher-underwood,is a wonder the 15 certificate held,8,25 February 2019,"A truly astonishing film that constantly surprises and confounds throughout its considerable length. Yes, it has to be admitted it is too long. This is not a problem whilst watching because one becomes transfixed by the all and sundry goings on but towards the end and the false endings start to kick in the time that has passed becomes evident. reducing the length would not seem difficult because there is a certain wastage and duplication in the first act. Indeed, in common with other Korean and Hong Kong films the attempts at humour seem not to work in the West. Too much tomfoolery and slapstick in all the seeming wrong places. Anyway, the main thrust of the film, taking place as it does in parts of Korea I have never seen depicted in film before, with little semi derelict shacks and undergrowth impinging, is really creepy and not a little worrying. The business with the shaman, the chickens, goat, swords and fire would have been bad enough but with the sad child being exorcised, in such evident pain, it is a wonder the 15 certificate held. A difficult but eyeopening and worthwhile look at the underside of the more primitive side of Korea with great landscape shots along the way.",The Wailing
6,KineticSeoul,Few neat symbolisms but I don't want to re-watch it for some clarification.,6,8 August 2016,"Now I liked the previous film this director made called ""The Chaser"". Because it has a simple premise that delved into humanity but kept me thinking. And by the end it really did stick with me when I first saw it. This one tries to outdo that film by trying to add bunch of imagery and symbolisms. By meshing a lot of elements the director borrowed from other films that are left ambiguous. But the thing is the narrative isn't up to par and tries to be bigger than what it is. I could tell what the director of this film was trying to do. To keep the audiences guessing and leave things a bit complex. So by the end of it they will be in awe with what is going on and keep them talking about exactly what happened. Now I appreciate director's that don't spoon feed you everything that is going on. It works if the film flows with it's narrative, but this just seemed more complex for the sake of being complex. Like he was trying to make things a bit more ambiguous for the audiences and leave it up to the viewers to comprehend what is going on. Which works in films if everything flows together and isn't forced. But it's like the director took a simple story and made it more complex than it really is and added bunch of imagery and symbolism. So the plot takes plays in a country side rural village. Where weird things start to go down with some of the villagers acting very strangely, saying vile things and becoming zombie like. They think some old Japanese guy is the source of what is going on. When one of the police officers start to look to be possessed they hire a shaman. And thing start to get even more crazy from there on. The thing about this movie is that it's overlong and I think it could have been shortened down to about 2 hours and cut 30 minutes of it out. Because the build up is actually quite boring and things start to get a bit interesting and escalate the tension after one and a half hours in. Which is actually quite long to get to the meat of the movie. I will admit few of the symbolisms and how it comes together is actually quite neat. But as a whole the film seemed to suffer from the issue that arises from the storytelling aspect of things. Overall, it did have some good points with few of the symbolism and re-watching it may clarify certain things but I really don't want to.6/10",The Wailing
7,FeastMode,my notes,1,24 July 2019,"Terrible. super long and boring. i couldn't get through it. after about an hour i either watched in high speed or was half watching, more as it went along. just sucks. (1 viewing)",The Wailing
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Gets under your skin and wriggles around.,8,8 January 2020,"'The Wailing (2016)' is an affair that sticks with you, leaving you to turn it over and over in your mind long after its credits have rolled. It's a constantly evolving experience, moving through several somewhat distinct acts defined only by your understanding of its plot's events. This is evidence of its keen awareness of its audience, as it is able to predict what you're thinking in order to set up a blindsiding reveal. A lot of the narrative is ambiguous, despite a fairly concrete end, and it makes for an extremely enigmatic watch, one in which your assumptions are always shifting and, somehow, never quite correct. When you think back on the piece, you realise how meticulously crafted it is right from the opening shot. It's exactly what it needs to be, even if it does sometimes seem slightly meandering and you can certainly feel its length. It's never even close to boring, constantly keeping you engaged and occasionally wrenching you to the edge of your seat. It's the kind of film that sneaks up on you; you don't realise your heart is in your mouth until it's too late. It's as much a mystery as it is a horror, but it's ultimately rather frightening. It has moments of wince-inducing gore, creepy imagery and unbearable tension but it's its overall effect that affects you the most. It's difficult to describe, really, but to say the picture is ominous is an understatement. Its only real flaw is the fact that some of its odd comedy, particularly in its earlier sequences, detracts ever-so-slightly from the sincerity of its narrative. Still, even this contributes to the story's decidedly off-kilter vibe. When it comes down to it, the thing is absolutely brilliant, a distinct and distinguished movie unlike most others of its kind. It gets under your skin and wriggles around for a long time. 8/10",The Wailing
9,gbill-74877,Needed tightening,5,2 May 2020,"Painfully long. Several really stupid moments in the plot. Scenes where the oafish cop (who really should not have been a cop, it would have made more sense) emotes in overwrought ways. Director Na Hong-jin seems to elongate and repeat everything, and I thought that the bloat took away from the horror. I also didn't care much for the Japanese demonization and tossing the word Jap around, even though I understand at least a little about the painful history. The cinematography was solid and the final scene was pretty cool, but it came way too late. This film should have been an hour shorter and its script tuned to make more sense.",The Wailing
10,A_Different_Drummer,"Astonishing ""Ambiguous Ending"" Horror",9,7 December 2016,"SPOILER: Have seen a lot of films, reviewed a lot of films but this extraordinary two and a half hour technically-perfect humanistic horror film from one of the finest writer/directors in the business (auteur of I SAW THE DEVIL) was something of a cipher.The closest analog I can suggest in David Lynch's 2001's Mulholland Drive, yet another technically perfect, humanistic, suspense opus which keeps you captivated for its full length, yet has you walking out of the theatre shaking your head and wondering what exactly you just saw? Both film-makers understand the ""big secret"" of story telling which is, if you can present your story in such a way that the viewer feels he or she is sharing the experience with the protagonist, you can tell any story you like and the viewer will just keep going.I will not even try to provide an explanation for what THE WAILING means, other than to re-quote the writer/director himself who, in numerous interviews on his film, said enigmatically ""I began to wonder about the nature of God -- what if he was not always good?"" Recommended on many levels. As entertainment, as a puzzle, and as a clinic in how to make a film that engages ... and just won't let go.",The Wailing
11,Reno-Rangan,A father's struggle to see his daughter to get well.,8,4 December 2016,"A new film from the writer, director of 'The Chaser' and 'The Yellow Sea'. This time its a horror-thriller that focused on a rural police officer who witnesses a series of strange events escalating fears among its people. The original title was 'Goksung', which means the name of the village where this story takes place. This film is specially for those who like Korean films. But I'm sure that everyone would enjoy it equally. Very typical Korean film yet an engaging theme and thrilling, particularly towards the final quarter.The opening, and almost the first act were like a black comedy. That does remain same after sometime. Because they wanted to give an impression what kind of person is this story's lead man. He's a cop, but feared of supernatural stuffs. So one day, he gets an early morning call to head where a family was slaughtered by one of its members. In his small village, with a small population, events like this are very rare, but when another similar incident was reported, ruled out what it was considered, but something else beyond humans.After the strange dreams, he comes to know his family too got affected by it, particularly his young daughter. Followed by when it gets serious issue, the family decides to bring in a shaman and so the ceremony begins to free her from whatever possessed. This is where the film turns more aggressive in revealing following event with twists and turns. The rest of the film should be watched to know how it all ends.The first thing was the film length. It was too long, nearly 150 minutes, but the screenplay filled with many enthralling scenes and dialogues. So I don't think sitting for that long would be an issue for most of the people. Surely you will be on your seat edge most of the time on your watch. Good story, but very confusing. I mean not puzzling way, but the events and its characters, especially the conclusion which is not exactly a perfect one with proper detail. So you might look for some clarifications after watching the film.""If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch? He's just fishing. Not even he knows what he'll catch.""The concept was a little confusing like what kind of horror is this. At one stage there comes a zombie, but it follows right after an exorcism on a girl possessed by a ghost. The writer used the time as long as he wants to develop them. So the narration was slow, but very steady on its direction going deep. If you are good at Korean films, the style they make, you might predict some of the scenes correctly. Like I said the final few minutes might confuse you, but really well done part if you understand that clearly.The film characters wise, I liked how it all connected at the end. But as a story, the solution did not seem right. I think not the fitting one or more convincing. I know who would you root, I mean most of you back what character, so from that perspective, feels it compromised a bit after put up a stern fight with what they had believed. I liked how culturally this story was narrated. I mean as its set in a small village, the ceremonies to fight the evil spirit was conducted traditional way, not the western style, except it opened with a quote from the bible.The actors were perfect, particularly I liked where it was shot. A fine location to mix horror and cop themes. The suspense keeps the film alive, but you won't always looking at that, because the theme expands quite bigger than you expect. There are some unexpected turns, you might find yourself scratching your head for how deep it could go.Don't worry, in the end, it all comes together, or maybe watching it twice could help you with that. As I said the runtime might not favour you for the second viewing. Besides, pay a good attention while watching it for the first time, then you will get everything. Particularly if you are an animal lover, that's a biggest clue you could get in this film.I think it will be one of the best horror you would find around the world this year. It might get remade elsewhere, but the chances are less and it could remain as one of the Korean classics in the line of many others like 'Memories of Murder'. You don't have to be a Korean film fan or this director's, but if you do, surely you will have an advantage in understanding it clearly and like it more than the others. Definitely it is one of the best Korean films, but I don't think so a must see, not according to me. Though I won't conclude my review without recommending it to you. So I say watch it.7.5/10",The Wailing
12,paulclaassen,Not as good as I was meant to believe.,5,17 June 2018,"This possession tale is told very differently and more mysteriously, which becomes increasingly disturbing as we learn more about what is actually happening here. The film was actually really creepy. There's also a lot of hidden agendas so one has to watch carefully and read between the lines. The ending will no doubt leave you a bit confused, as it appears there's been more than one demon all along (or at least an apprentice) but this is not made very clear. A second viewing might solve some of your unanswered questions.I must admit I found Do-won Kwak's acting almost lazy. Maybe this was the story's intention to have him look incompetent, but his character as a policeman was not very credible. The police in general seemed clueless and inexperienced and that was a bit of a drawback for me. When they found all the evidence at the Japanese man's home, they simply left and did not even attempt an arrest or brought him in for questioning. That was just not believable. They also too easily believed gossip instead of evidence, and the whole investigation back story was a lackluster effort, to say the least. In contrast, Hwan-hee Kim was excellent as the possessed girl.",The Wailing
13,marmar-69780,The Wailling,7,2 November 2020,The Wailling was a good Korean horror film that has some great use of atmosfere and tension and some solid scares but what is even more important it teaches us some important staff about religion and faith but also with regret and revenge.Normally Japan was a Asian country that used to make a great horrors but after this one Korea showed that they arent a pushover and that they can make a very good horror film to and not just crime thrillers or crime dramas.Story was effective and chilling in some parts.Characters were interesting and i was able to find myself caring for them.Wailling was a good Korean horror,The Wailing
14,subxerogravity,"It was a big meaty movie with a lot of things on it, but it works.",7,21 July 2016,"There were so many elements to the movie and somehow it all works out well. Films with this much meat could have went down badly but some how, this movie works, and makes for a very unique experience.At it's core it resembles mostly a Korean Horror film, but it does not start that way. The main character is a police officer in a local village who is investigating a strange illness that has inflected the place after a stranger comes into town. The investigation gets more personal when he discovers his daughter has become one of the inflected.The movie has everything you need for a contemporary horror film, it's got the right about of humor, sex and fright. Though it's a ghost story, it also makes good use of one Zombie in the film.It's very entertaining, which is good cause the movie is over two hours long, and the note that the length does cause some confusion the story , but overall it's great.So good you know Hollywood will adapt it soonhttp://cinemagardens.com/?p=69",The Wailing
15,Turfseer,Shlock-infested South Korean horror import fails to scare or entertain,3,4 November 2017,"Why do critics often overrate foreign films? Could it be that that there are no frames of reference to effect able comparisons? Such is the case with Na Hong-jin's, The Wailing, a rather dopey ""horror thriller"" set in a rural area of South Korea. If you must see this inane tale, then see it for the nifty cinematography which features plush landscapes of the South Korean countryside.The protagonist here is Jong-goo, a police officer, who dotes on his young daughter, Hyo-jin. One is struck immediately by the crude talk of the local constabulary which Jong-goo belongs, having attained the rank of sergeant. The local police have now been entrusted with investigating a series of deaths due to what initially is believed to be some kind of gruesome infectious disease, leaving bubonic plague-like splotches on the skin, leading to murders committed by sole family members.A mysterious woman informs Jong-goo about an elderly Japanese man, living out in the sticks, who might be a person of interest. A local hunter claims he saw the man almost naked, with glowing red eyes, eating a deer. Jong-goo, along with another officer, perform what appears to be a warrant-less search on the stranger's house while he is away and the partner finds pictures of the infected and murdered victims inside the Japanese man's home (he's so shocked that he doesn't he even tell Jong-goo).No need to go into great detail about what happens next. Suffice it to say that when Hyo-jin becomes infected, Jong- goo attempts to hunt the Japanese man down after putting a posse together including a young Japanese-speaking deacon. They aren't successful in capturing the alleged ""demon,"" and then Jong-goo's mother- in-law recommends employing Il-gwang, a local shaman, who subsequently performs a bizarre ritual designed to remove the spirits inhabiting Hyo- jin's body.Jong-goo finally is forced to play ""will the real demon please stand up,"" and is unable to discern whether the mysterious woman he encountered earlier is being truthful when she denies being the demon and continuing to point the finger at the ""Jap"" (antipathy toward the Japanese still apparently runs high even among modern day South Koreans). The deacon however, ends up confronting the old man who reveals himself to be the actual demon.The ending is decidedly not happy at all when Jong-goo returns home and finds his wife and mother-in-law slaughtered by his now possessed daughter. There is supposed to be some kind of twist when we discover that Il-gwang might be part of the demon club, after we see him returning to his car, unintentionally dropping a box containing photos of the other victims of those possessed.The Wailing disappoints for two major reasons. First there's the protagonist Jong-goo, played by Do-won Kwak. I don't think I've ever seen a police officer as wimpy as the one played by Kwak. The demon appears to wreak havoc upon his psyche and he's end up a blubbering mess —a shell of a man—at film's end. Where was Bruce Willis when you needed him?Second and more important, Na Hong-jin's monster isn't one bit scary or original. All the flesh eating and glowing eyes are things we've seen many times before in these type of films. The only people who end up wailing are those who pay tickets for this paltry and lugubrious entry in the pantheon of shlock (not shock) infested entertainment.",The Wailing
16,jadavix,"At first intriguing, then distancing",6,8 January 2017,"""The Wailing"" is a movie which starts intriguingly, continues as such for about an hour or so, and then lost my interest almost completely. There isn't enough plot, nor enough attention grabbing moments, to keep you interested up until the end, where the whole story may or may not be revealed. I don't know, because I wasn't really paying attention. I'd become frustrated by all the barely noticeable bits of information that weren't really leading anywhere.The story is about a bumbling cop in a South Korean village where people have been going crazy ever since a Japanese man showed up. I was wondering if there was a subtext about inter-Asian race relations, but I don't think so. There is also a ""shaman"" featured in the movie - Korean shamanism is apparently a sizeable minority in the country. This isn't explored in much depth, however.There are a couple of things about ""The Wailing"" that make it really dare to be different. For one thing, it's actually funny. The protagonist is a lazy, bumbling small town cop, who is anything but at home in a world of violence, let alone a world of the supernatural. The movie is not screamingly hilarious, but it has a consistently funny tone.The other thing is the focus of the story. Movies like this generally bring you inside the minds of the protagonists; this one is more interested in capturing the essence of this strange, leafy town.This quality is at first intriguing, but becomes a hindrance as the movie goes on. The focus needed to start to narrow, but never really seems to. The movie keeps you at a distance, and that curtailed my enjoyment somewhat.",The Wailing

It took us 3 settings (I kept falling asleep)...it is 2 and a half hours long. This is a Korean exorcism movie by the director of The Chaser (pretty good action film). This movie was pretty good outside the long over the top exorcism scenes (which is scene after scene of exorcisms not working for about 25 minutes of yawning lol). This movie had a great premise, characters, and ending but got bogged down trying to create extra drama during the exorcism scenes that really didn't work for me. I'd give it a 5/10.",The Wailing
18,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,8,7 July 2017,"Shall I state the obvious? At 156 minutes, 'The Wailing' is very long. If it was split down the middle into two chapters, that would at least allow a breather in between acts. Alright? I've got that off my chest, so we can move on. Because 'The Wailing' is excellent. How is it that this modestly budgeted South Korean horror film, that features only occasional special effects and a cast of actors of varied ages (as opposed to predominantly young and pretty) shows up obscenely financed mainstream Hollywood output as being tired, CGI-reliant and shallow? Perhaps for precisely those reasons.Kwak Do-won is excellent as Jong-goo, a police officer investigating a series of outbreaks of a mysterious wasting disease in and around his village. Various scenes of violently possessed and afflicted characters illustrate this. When the malady appears to affect his daughter Hyo-jinn, he sees the progression of the disease first-hand. Kim Hwan-hee is a revelation as the placid, loving daughter slowly transformed into a shrieking, snarling fiend – afraid of the shaman Il-gwang (Hwang Jung-min) brought in to exorcise her, and snarling accusatory curses at the father who is trying to save her.""When you go fishing, you don't know what you'll catch. 'He's' just fishing "", to slightly misquote the reply to Jong-goo's wearied wonderings as to why his daughter should be afflicted. As to who 'he' is – we have to assume the worst. And yet even her transformation isn't the worst we see.Jun Kunimura plays the morose hermit who may or may not be behind the witchery, and yet when Jong-goo and Il-gwang dispose of him, the shaman feels that they have done away with the wrong person  Evocative and effective use is made of location, and especially the elements. On occasions, the atmosphere looks extremely cold, and when it rains, it comes down in torrents. Director Na Hong-jin conjures up a very convincing sense of violent evil within a small community. My only slight issue with 'The Wailing' is that, after all that time, there is no real ending – which is something I usually don't mind at all, but felt this could perhaps have done with some kind of pay-off. Perhaps a sequel is a possibility  We have time to get to know the characters, watch them grow and share with them their harrowing experiences. Productions like this, when they come along, almost re-write the structure of telling an effective story – so much so that, while over two-and-a-half hours is a long time to concentrate on a film, you certainly aren't in any hurry for it to end.",The Wailing
19,drownnnsoda,Absorbing,10,5 January 2017,"Jong-Goo is a police officer in a remote South Korean village nestled in the mountains. After the arrival of a Japanese immigrant, a series of bizarre murders begin to occur, committed by the various townspeople who seem to be under a zombie-like spell. The situation becomes personal, however, when Jong-Goo's young daughter begins to exhibit symptoms similar to those of the murderers.While Japan has been a majorly recognized force in horror cinema, it wasn't until ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" was released in 2003 that neighboring South Korea was really on the map for international genre fans. ""The Wailing"" is a fine addition to the horror canon, and an unexpected one. The first half of the film is marked by wry dark humor and intelligent dialogue, and is at times so witty, you wonder if you are watching a horror film; that is, until you are reminded by violent and disturbing encroachments. The latter half of the film is remarkably darker in tone and spirit, and feels like a through-and-through horror film. While this shift in tone does leave the film feeling a bit odd in terms of balance, the upshot is that you're likely absorbed enough by the mid-point that you're in it for the long haul anyway. Moody cinematography and atmospheric shots of the desolate mountain landscapes give the film a distinguished ominous sensibility, and there are some fantastically gruesome scenes interspersed throughout that give the greatest of zombie flicks a run for their money. The performances in the film are phenomenal and lend the proceedings further credibility. Do-won Kwak's performance as the troubled father/policeman is raw and realistic, while Hwan-hee Kim's performance as his possessed daughter is unbelievably good—in the ranks of Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist,"" as far as I'm concerned. Some have expressed dissatisfaction with the conclusion, which is somewhat understandable; it does leave room for interpretation, no doubt. That said, I think the primary reason so many have felt let down by it is merely because the film is so long—running over two and a half hours, I think many people are expecting a more explosive payoff, which we don't get (nor do I necessarily think we should). The final act is truly disturbing, and is both visceral and spiritual in equal measure.All in all, I was completely absorbed by the world created in ""The Wailing."" Riddled with tension, it burns slowly from beginning to end, with occasional spurts of grotesque violence, and is rife with religious overtones and themes; the acting makes it all the more engrossing. While it does run a bit long, the film never lost my interest, which is rare. It's not every day that I see a film that is able to both completely absorb me and also maintain consistent intrigue, no less a horror film. 10/10.",The Wailing
20,kluseba,By far the best movie of the year,10,9 November 2016,"''The Wailing'' is easily the best movie of the year 2016. It's at least the best Korean film since the vivid action-comedy flick ''Quick'' and the war epic ''My Way'' five years ago. It's on the same level as horror and thriller classics like ''Memories of Murder'', ''Oldboy'' and ''Sympathy for Mister Vengeance''. I would say that ''The Wailing'' is at least the most intense horror movie since the first part of the ''Insidious'' series six years earlier. Since this movie doesn't get a wider release in North American and European cinemas despite being a massive success at the South Korean box office, I urge you to buy it on BluRay or DVD as soon as you can to experience this unforgettable masterpiece.The story of this mystery and horror film takes place in a remote and rather poor Korean village where a series of strange events occurs. People seem to commit horrible crimes while being under the influence of what seems to be an abominable disease or a weird drug. People kill their own family members, friends or neighbors for no apparent reason by stabbing them to death or burning down their houses among other elements. Local police officer Jong-goo is scared and shocked by those horrible events but grimly determined to uncover the mystery behind those crimes. Despite being initially analytical, grounded and reluctant to investigate superstitious claims that those crimes are related to a mysterious Japanese shaman living in the woods and feasting on raw animal meat, Jong-goo feels more and more confused, haunted and helpless when he can't find any logical explanation for the series of gruesome crimes and confronts the mysterious stranger. Soon after this, Jong-goo own daughter seems to change as she is abnormally hungry, behaves strangely and reacts aggressively towards anyone who is approaching her. Jong-goo realizes that he must solve the mysterious incidents in his village as quickly as possible in order to save his daughter.There are many elements that make this movie so outstanding. One element is the sinister story itself that keeps the audience guessing until the end. Just like the main character, the audience quickly doesn't know what to believe in anymore and the haunting ending only adds to the brilliance of the movie.The movie's strongest key to success is probably its intense atmosphere. Most scenes take places during storms or heavy rainfall which adds to the tension of the film. The fitting locations include dark forests, dirty huts and empty highways. The slow and menacing pace of the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat as it is regularly interrupted by sudden graphic or sinister scenes that feel so shockingly realistic because they aren't exaggerated or overwhelming. A brooding soundtrack, fitting costumes and settings and sinister light techniques only increase the almost unbearably tense atmosphere. Despite an epic running time of more than two and a half hours, this film doesn't have any unnecessary lengths in my opinion.Another winning element is the incredibly detailed work by director Na Hong-jin. Each scene serves a specific character development, an increase of seemingly supernatural and stunning elements or a particular clue to involve the audience and let it put the pieces of the puzzle together. The movie took more than half a year to be made and it really pays off in the end. This film feels incredibly detailed, stunningly acted and perfectly produced.The actors and actresses are all giving the best performances of their lives. One has to point out main character Kwak Do-won who changes from a caring, determined and strong father to a desperate, helpless and impulsive shadow of its former self who is haunted by nightmares and tries to solve his problems in violent manners. It's easy for the audience to identify with this charismatic, emotional and realistic character from start to finish. The supporting actors are just as great because there are many mysteries revolving around them and you never really know whether they are good or bad or somewhere in between. Police officer Jong-goo meets a mysterious woman dressed in white who seems to give him clues to solve the strange murder cases and save his daughter but at certain points in the story, she seems strangely passive and might even try to fool the main character. Jong-goo also encounters a young shaman who seems helpful and powerful at first contact but whose scary rituals seem to harm the main character's daughter more than anything else. Obviously, there is the mysterious Japanese stranger who only communicates in his mother tongue and whose recent appearance in the remote Korean community evokes numerous questions.The combination of an extremely professional director, an intriguing script and story that requests multiple views, a cast consisting of young and veteran actors who put all their heart and soul into their performances, an intense yet realistic atmosphere supported by a haunting soundtrack, scary settings and costumes and gloomy light techniques and a great production that takes its time to develop a perfect pace without any flaws such as shaky cameras or unrealistic special effects make this film a masterpiece of the contemporary art of film-making. If you like mystery and horror movies, there is no way for you to get around this movie. If you were to miss out on this movie, you simply couldn't consider yourself an expert of these two genres anymore. Stop reading other reviews and purchase this film right away.",The Wailing
21,Pairic,Dark Folk Horror,9,14 May 2018,"The Wailing: South Korean Horror involving Demons, a Shaman, strange infections, murders and perhaps Zombies; certainly a lot of biting going on. A Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) is living in a shack in the woods in rural South Korea, people say that he eats deer alive and infects people, perhaps both physically and mentally. Is he some sort of Demon? There is also a strange young woman (Chun Woo-hee), is she in fact the source of the area's ills?Villagers begin to act strangely, start murder each other gruesomely, run around biting people, commit arson. A local police sergeant (Kwak Do-won) investigates and puts his own family at risk. His daughter (Kim Hwan-hee) may be possessed or controlled by a Demon. He is persuaded to call in a Shaman (Hwang Jung-min) to perform an exorcism but the Shaman realises that this in itself won't solve the problem, a stronger ritual will be required to finally rid the village of the Demon.Quite a violent film with several brutal murders committed both on and off stage. Also elements of psychological terror are well used throughout the film, in particular the primeval panic evoked by the forest. The ritual itself is explained and illustrated in detail, both the animal sacrifices during it and the cleansing rites necessary beforehand, bringing to mind the film A Dark Song. This is South Korean Folk Horror.Directed and written by Na Hong-jin this is a demanding film which you will not easily put out of your mind. At 156 minutes however it does drag in places and would have benefited from 20 minutes being judiciously cut from the running time. 8.5/10. On Netflix.",The Wailing

23,jfgibson73,Hong-jin Na's Horror Epic,6,25 March 2020,"Here is a movie that got a tremendous amount of praise from critics and viewers as being a memorable horror film. I thought it was well filmed and acted, especially the child actress. This might be the most intense performance a child actor has given on film. The story definitely made me care about the characters, and when it was over, I wanted to know more about what I had just watched. However, after taking time to reflect and review some of the interpretations that have been put out there, I've decided that The Wailing didn't quite meet my expectations. It was hard to follow, and most people seem to understand that the director wanted some things to be intentionally vague. But what bothered me is that I felt like the story kept introducing new plot points that didn't seem connected to what had come before. When I got to the end and saw what other people had to say about what was going on, it didn't do anything to deepen my appreciation of the movie. It's long, too, and it feels like it meanders, even if everything does somehow tie together at the end. I just didn't respond that strongly to it. I think some of the imagery will stick with me, but I don't feel like I enjoyed it enough to want to watch it back. I can't say that I don't recommend it, because obviously a lot of people really enjoyed it, I just didn't happen to be one.",The Wailing
24,aharmas,A Truly Scary Tour De Force,10,5 June 2016,"Gems like these are truly hard to find, and I'm glad we live in an age where we have the opportunity to catch them in specialty cinemas because it would be terrible to see them in the small screen. It's a Korean film, with some terrific acting and some of the best effects I have seen recently, but what elevates the movie to a special level is its theme and its execution. It is based on popular concepts, yet it will keep you guessing until the very end. It's a tale that will teach you, entertain you, and most definitely scary. It's a thriller with plenty of muscle and heart.The waiting takes you on a long and torturous trip through hell, where a father does whatever he has to do to help his town and ultimately, his daughter. It moves fast and doesn't hold back in showing what begins as the work if a maniac, serial killer, and turns into a mysterious murder mystery with supernatural overtones.The film never falters, even with a brief inclusion of zombies, which I figure is part of the writer's desire to be pretty inclusive in matters if the difference manifestations of good and evil. One will never experience anything but a sense of impending threat and doom. Some members in the audience might feel it's too much but it's all justifiable. It runs over 2.5 hours and one leaves the theater wishing there was more to explain. This would devaluate from the experience because one of the film objectives is to make think the audience go back and look at the clues and turning points, to look into one's own sense of values and want to go back to look at some references upon which the script builds.Rum and see it. A classic has been born.",The Wailing
25,I_Ailurophile,Masterful horror thriller,10,15 May 2021,"It's violent, bloody, and unquestionably disturbing. Its length, though necessary, nonetheless begins to eventually feel a bit much; plot is a little convoluted, with some elements that are never fully explained, and clarity is offered for others with only one shot of the camera for viewers to discern. Through it all, 'The wailing' is thrilling, utterly captivating - and well worth seeking out.Writer-director Na Hong-jin's attention to detail is entrancing, both in his screenplay and direction. Characters and camera alike have a keen eye, taking in all there is to see - and truly, there's a lot to take in. Set design, props, wardrobe, effects, makeup - at every level the production is dense in its content, and intense, making the narrative look as complete as it feels. Even just the energy clearly put into ramshackle home kept by ""the Japanese stranger"" (Jun Kunimura) is astonishing, and thorough - to say nothing of other locations, or whole scenes.The entire cast is outstanding. Kwak Do-won portrays protagonist Jong-goo in a very relatable, believable way, initially rather bumbling but increasingly stressed and personally invested in the goings-on. Even Kim Hwan-hee, only 13 years old at the time the film was released, is excellent as Jong-goo's beleaguered young daughter, Hyo-jin. All involved perform admirably, giving great life to their characters and building the immersive world 'The wailing' is set in.As a great example of the fastidious marvel of this feature, my thoughts linger on a sequence in the middle of the film in which the camera leaps between three concurrent scenes. At his abode, the Japanese stranger conducts a simple but increasingly fervent ritual. Outside the central family's home, hired shaman Il-gwang (Hwang Jung-min) performs an elaborate, escalating ceremony. Nearby, Hyo-jin, a victim of the strange illness in the village, apparently reacts with alarming violence to one or both of the simultaneous circumstances. It's difficult to succinctly expound on how sophisticated these scenes are in their construction, or the way the shots are so finely oriented, let alone edited together. Again, too, the performances of each actor are simply wonderful. And this is just one instance.Mystery turns to thrills, unease becomes horror, and with every slight turn in the narrative it remains deeply engrossing. It's impossible to divert our gaze from the feature - but it's of such great quality, in every regard, we don't want to, either. The length may be a bit daunting, yet 'The wailing' is an outstanding picture I readily recommend to any fans of the genre it plays in.",The Wailing
26,truemythmedia,One of the Best Horror Films of the Decade,10,6 November 2019,"The Wailing is my favorite horror movie, it's perfect for this Halloween season, and just a good, entertaining, intelligent movie that can be dissected any time throughout the year. Although the runtime is imposing, every single minute is crafted in the hands of director Na Hong-Jin, who goes to great lengths to show off his craft, by creating a deep, layered, yet simple story, filled with humor, followed by dread and evil, each character being three dimensional, fitting into the mold that has been cast for them. From the chilling beginning, the horrific nightmarish middle, to the bone rattling, no hope for anyone twist ending that will linger in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll. The Wailing is about making choices and the consequences that come with those choices, it's about man versus evil and at what lengths one will go to protect that which one loves, no matter the end result. I cannot recommend this film enough to those who are willing to take the journey, and if you do prepare yourself for one hell of a ride.",The Wailing
27,robertemerald,Confusing for non-Koreans,7,11 December 2019,"The Wailing is a long film, over two hours. It certainly keeps you guessing, right to the end, and the solution could just as easily have been biological as spiritual. It does end well, and is satisfying. Not so satisfying are some of the plot holes and the way Koreans interact. The main man is abused by his superior, and he in turn abuses his junior. That was totally unnecessary, didn't work as humour and didn't help you identify with the hero. It's also hard to understand the cultural difference. First there is the language, which seems to use a lot of words sometimes for a quick reaction, or barely a sound for whole sentences. Also culturally it is hard to place the little village where the action takes place. On the one hard there are advanced police techniques and a well-equiped modern hospital, where on the other hand people seem to prefer rumour as truth, shaman magic and acupuncture and herbs to remedy their ills. A small child at one point has an extreme rash over half of her body, yet the hospital doesn't think it warranted to keep her in overnight for observation or further tests to find out what's wrong with her. Many conversations seem unfinished. OK. It's a Korean movie, and thus you expect all the characters to be quirky and garrulous. Even so, there's a lot of unnecessary swearing and odd reactions. As horror it's kind of bumbling, but also kind of original. The cinematography was terrific and that's what really got me through the two hours. It's wonderful to see another culture photographed well. Definitely worth a look, but I'd hesitate to want to sit through it again.",The Wailing

For me, I can't seem to enjoy it as much - just felt a bit dull and boring - I wish the movie was more hypnotising and engaging after hearing so much about it everywhere online. It's okay - it's not a 'masterpiece' in my books - yes the last 20 or so minutes are really good to watch as a movie-goer but it doesn't really do much after that initial viewing.So for me it's 5/10 for 'The Wailing' certainly not an 8 which I was hoping it would be after the hype surrounding it and the glowing reviews it's been showered with.",The Wailing

The first act is interesting, because you get a police procedural played for laughs but with a real sense of rural superstition and prejudice. My favourite scene was the girl throwing the stones - it introduces an odd character in a memorable way, and also does a funny time-passing gag as the stones build up around the hero's feet.The second act packs in a lot, especially the impressive dance exorcism, and the third act starts with a good zombie fight and does a skillful job of keeping the audience guessing. Problem is some scenes are clunky, where you keep wishing they'd get there already or do the obvious thing or just stop repeating questions. And what were they thinking with the translator scene? Tiresome. In the end I wasn't sure the story had created its own world.The acting is good. Early on the lead was sometimes annoying. But the standout was the daughter - huge charisma when she was happy, chilling when she was possessed.Pace was a bit uneven in the first half, but nice and tight as the climax approached. Editing not too imaginative, and there was no standout image, but the director did well to keep the story moving when it could have collapsed into confusion.Music was excellent in the exorcism scene, but otherwise mostly orchestral mood stuff.Overall: Big ship that shaves a few icebergs but makes it to port. 7/10, although it should be worth a rewatch so I may mark it up.ps.

I still got a bit out of it just from a first watch, but it was quite overwhelming, despite a few slower moments where I was wondering if I was somehow finding it underwhelming?Those moments are rare, but the film was long, and I wasn't entirely sure why this story was told in 2.5 hours rather than two or less. I'm possibly missing a lot, because I couldn't shake the feeling this was a film I could barely crack the surface of.Still, I recognise the technical skill of it all, as well as the strength of the acting and the uniqueness of its setting and overall mood. There are also a few genuinely unsettling sequences- this proved to be more frightening that the majority of other horror movies out there, yet to call it just a horror movie feels like a disservice.I've spent a lot of words now saying I don't know exactly what to say about this.

And this is only the beginning, as more and more people in this small Korean town start going mad and killing others (and sometimes even themselves) in the process.He, his partner, and the local priest suspect a Japanese man, who has recently moved into the area, is somehow involved. And when they hear a tale told by the local tonic salesman- about a near-naked man eating from a raw deer carcass in the woods- they are driven to investigate further.They trek out towards the Japanese man's woodland haunt, and find that it's complete with skull-laden ritual chamber, and photographs of everyone who went mad, before and after their murder and/or murder/suicide sprees...which only acts to corroborate their suspicions.But, it may already be too late for the Sergeant. He discovers his daughter has been targeted, and fears for her, and his family's, safety- considering the nature of recent events, and all.This fear is justified when his daughter starts going mad: screaming & flailing; telling off her father with all manner of profanities; and threatening to murder them all. Awaking to a goat carcass with it's entrails hanging out at your front gate probably isn't a good sign either.When questioned about his involvement, the Japanese man simply replies, ""You wouldn't believe me if I told you."" So the Sergeant and his family turn to a local Shaman for help. Hoping they can figure out what is really going on, and do what they can to protect themselves.He reveals, to them, that the suspected Japanese man is actually a ghost- or more accurately a demon...and he's out to get the Sergeant for wronging him.What follows is nothing short of an epic battle of dark vs light, as the two shaman's face off, ritualistically, in an attempt to hex each other to death.But, perhaps things are not exactly as they seem...just when you think it is over...As someone who is interested in Shamanism, I really enjoyed this film! It's quite long at over 150 minutes runtime, but it keeps you intrigued by slowly unraveling the mystery, then totally shifting gears once you think you've got it all figured out. Despite being oriented around zombies, ghosts and demonic possession, the storyline comes off as wholly original...which is not such an easy feat in today's saturated horror-market. And that ending had me on the edge of my seat!!!When all you have is faith to go on, which side would you choose...? The Wailing is an intriguing blend of crime, horror, mystery and dark comedy, that plays with dichotomies in interesting ways, and keeps you in the dark up until the very last moment. It is finely constructed and extremely entertaining. Definitely worth a watch. Highly recommended.7.5 out of 10.",The Wailing

A mysterious disease starts spreading among the villagers, causing a rash which precedes violent murderous outbreaks followed by stupor and eventually death.Police officer Jong-goo, who is investigating the case, meets a mysterious young woman called Moo-myeong (""no name"" in Korean), who tells him about the Japanese stranger, and later disappears. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Well-known actor Kwak Do-won plays the central character of the film as Jong-goo. Jong-goo does not believe in ghosts the paranormal etc., etc. But as sinister events unfold before his eyes he is forced to seek help from those who are acquainted with the occult. There are no overly spectacular C.G.I. special effects in this film. Special effects are kept to a bare minimum. The atmosphere and psychological horror are what makes this film special. Na Hong-jin who has already directed the cult film The Chaser(2008) and the highly acclaimed drama The Yellow Sea(2010) adds one more superb film to his career.

Some characters abruptly changed behaviors and became more aggressive, and each time the tension made me feel uneasy and on the edge.When the last act hit, the tension went to the roof. I felt uncomfortable and anxious because the act involved whether to trust a character or another. The consequence was dangerous, and I felt like I need to make the decision, just like the protagonist in the movie.

So what makes this movie watchable repeatedly is the amazing screenplay and the narrative. It's not a jump scare horror but an unsettling story that keeps you hooked into the movie until finally the movie ends and you keep asking yourself what was all that you saw. It's one of those Korean movies with a very fine storytelling added with some fine performances by the lead. It's humorous at times, sentimental sometimes and thrilling on the rest of the movie. Also, the movie leaves you with some interpretations and relies on the rest on our interpretations but mainly it's a illustrative with some blanks in between. The fact that it can be watched multiple times is also because of the fine cinematography, editing and score. So overall the director deserves an appreciation for bringing together some of the fine members in the movie teamWhat did not work:
The run time is a bit longer making it a lengthy experience. Of course I think some of the scenes could have been cut down to shorten the movie for example the zombie scenes.

If you are not a fan of the horror genre, you will probably find this film very difficult to watch. But I must say it was an astonishingly unique. A great perspective. An incredibly creepy and dark vision, and a fantastic execution of that vision. And a film that just transports you to a totally unique cinematic universe. Great characters. Great character development. Great performances. Fantastic direction. Very well written. This is a great film. Hollywood just does not know how to do movies like this. Horror has a different name and a different face in Korea. And it is not the weak, sanitized Hollywood version of it. But rather a vision of darkness and Hell on Earth. And total devastation. This movie was amazing. Korean cinema rocks! Why this director has not done dozens of movies is a real puzzle.",The Wailing
45,frankblack-79961,Major hyped up reviews for this flick.,5,9 August 2020,Its a movie that keeps you interested but it's hard to watch such inept characters bumble through it. Not been too impressed with Korean cinema so far. They all seem to have great stories with unimpressive characters that have as much common sense as a hammer. I think many reviewer think they are true art fans if they pump up cinema made outside the US even if it's mediocre filmmaking. What makes a good or bad film has nothing to do with its origin.,The Wailing

For Pete's sake, there is zero continuity to this movie's ending. It appears the lady in white was telling the truth about him waiting 3 crows to go home, but then she said the shaman and old man were in together. How is this possible when the Shaman nearly killed the old man until dumbo cop stopped him from performing the ritual. But the shaman said the old man was a shaman like him and a good guy yet he turns into the devil.

48,coreyjdenford,Wailing of the Beast,8,26 November 2016,"This review of The Wailing is spoiler free**** (4/5)AFTER HIS STUNNINGLY and shockingly assured debut, The Chaser back in 2008 which finally dimmed the burning candle that was left alight after The Silence of the Lambs shocked audiences, and after his grim, gripping and excruciatingly violent crime thriller The Yellow Sea. Korean writer/director Na Hong-jin turns to horror which has a rather ambitious mixture of police procedural drama, part visceral and demonic horror, sometimes hilarious black comedy with a couple of laugh out loud parts, and finally part socio-theological allegory as you're trying to figure out some of the more difficult and somewhat confusing parts of this clever screenplay which leads to a shocking mystery towards the end. The Wailing opens with Jong Goo (Do Won Kwak) a police officer enjoying his daily job and living happily in his rural home with his wife and spirited young daughter, it seems that life for him could not get any better and he couldn't ask for anything more. But when a spate of brutal and violent murders start to wreak havoc all over this quiet suburb, the media blame wild poisonous mushrooms that have suddenly started growing all over the place, but Jong isn't convinced as he hears news that an elderly man has just moved into the area after spending time in Japan and so he starts to suspect that the stranger is the cause of this mysterious illness.But as soon as he suspects this he starts to suffer from endless nightmares and has feelings of insomnia and his family start to worry as it is ruining his life. But suddenly his daughter becomes heavily ill and he thinks that she is going to die as he has seen the result of what happens when others get this illness so it is his job to seek help as he wants to save her from the brunt of this terrible illness, but he soon finds out that it isn't an illness it is just a possession from a ghostly presence. At the start of the second act he and his colleagues search the house of the elderly man and they find something so shocking which brings a new edge to the story as it becomes a rather bellowing dark thriller, but the investigation goes wrong when he thinks he finds something that belongs to his daughter but she soon denies it in her possessed state. Until Jong seeks the help of Il-Gwang (Hwang Jong-min) the village shaman, unfortunately the film starts to flag a little during the second act perhaps due to the excessive time spent on the exorcism ritual, but it's essential stuff as this is used for setting up a third and final which leads a finale which is both genuinely shocking and ingeniously inevitable, as this will leave you with an unshakeable sense of dread.Na Hong-jin keeps with the traits through and through firstly starting with a scene with Jong and his young daughter and it seems that she has been cured from the almost futile illness which is an odd switch in tone but it's nice to be included, but as the third act continues the thrills and mysterious escalate. Picture a scene: with a beautiful rural family home, and all of a sudden a female ghost dressed entirely in white appears, her talking about your family dying if you go back to them, and then transitioning to one of your colleagues who gets a shock which he will never be able to forget for as long as he lives. Essentially the final act of The Wailing is filled with unencumbered thrills, shocks and terrifying scares which burrow under your skin and never leaves you.Indeed, The Wailing may be a bit long at 2 and a half hours long and has a slightly familiar premise with The Silence of the Lambs as it is filled with thrills, unencumbered shocks and visceral terrifying demonic scares, and by the end this will leave you with a horrible, unshakeable and fundamentally unforgettable sense of demonic dread which you will want to see again and again. It seems that K-horror like The Wailing and Train to Busan is surviving with a trait that Holloywood can never get back again in modern day horrors.VERDICT: Na Hong-jin's horror is a terrifying and unforgettable exercise which burrows under your skin leaving you with a lingering, unshakeable sense of dread that modern Hollywood horrors can rarely seem to muster now-a-days; one of the best ever horrors.8/10 Terrifying.",The Wailing

It's this low-key, down to earth approach to the subject(s) that makes the movie compelling. It's not only a Who Done It but a WHAT Did It, with echoes of MEMORIES OF MURDER, THE EXORCIST, and many an Asian Fright Film thrown into the mix. At two and a half hours, it may well be TOO involving for most Couch Potatoes, whose attention span(s) these days tend toward the Attention Deficit Disorder variety, thanks in no small part to prolonged exposure to Commercial programs (with their non-stop, constant interruptions, which undermine the Mood the better Fright Films tend toward) and, of course, video games.

It was unnecessary stretched. The director could have shown us much better in 2hr 30min.In between the movie, I was confused if I was watching horror or drama movie.

51,fciocca,"A movie full of twists and turns, a different take on the whole exorcism genre. Confusing and unsettling ending.",6,4 July 2021,"""The Wailing"" is a different take on the whole exorcism/possession kind of movie. I enjoyed the character development of Jong-Goo, a policeman of a small town that suddenly has to investigate some serious crimes and does not know how to approach the whole situation, as he is not used to handling this kind of work. This is where the most ""comedic"" part of the movie comes into play, which was okay, but at times a little bit cringey. I mean, seeing some policemen acting like scared teenagers is not for sure pleasant, or believable. The film gets better when these mysterious events directly hit the policeman's family, therefore we have a complete change of his behavior. At first I thought that this was a slow burner, considering his length, in reality it is very adrenalinic and dense with events.The more you watch it, the darker it gets. There are a lot of explicit and gruesome images. ""The Wailing"" kept me on the verge and I always wondered what was going to happen. Nothing is granted, because there are so many plot twists, maybe even too many. By the end, I had a lot of questions that never got answered. Who were the good guys and who were the bad ones? Were these events some sort of conspiracy between different evil entities that decided to take over a village or if there was in fact someone trying to save these people? I love movies with open endings, because I can give my own interpretation, but this leaves just too many unresolved points, and it is unsettling to me. However, the script is well written, it is just not as straightforward. I am pretty sure that to fully understand it, I need to watch it more than once.The photography and cinematography are really nice, locations are stunning. ""The Wailing"" is a pleasant surprise that with a better thought ending and perhaps with the cut of some useless and cringe worthy moments, could have been easily 7 or even 8 stars out of 10, but this unfortunately is not the case. However, I strongly recommend watching it, especially if you love horror.",The Wailing

55,madhukar30,Unforgettable tale of a bizarre Supernatural !!,8,4 June 2021,"The Wailing is set in a rural village surrounded by mountains where a series of mysterious murders and deaths shrouds its citizens. The protagonist, a policeman, visits a fresh case where he discovers a person suffering from boils and bruises throughout his body sitting in the front yard high, as a kite without a sense of his doings. They suspect that it's the work of some wild mushrooms influencing the heinous crimes but likewise another suspicion comes into play because of a mysterious Japanese man who recently moved into the village, just around when the events starts to occur. The story follows, the uncovering of the truth revolving around this Japanese man and a hoard of mind-boggling twists and turns. Now, How is that for a plot? Thanks to its writer and director Hong-jin Na, who takes us on a roller coaster horror ride.The film sticks to a bizarre storyline and delivers one of the most epic climaxes I have seen in a horror movie since Rosemary's Baby, Sixth Sense and The Ring. The treatment style of the movie is very linear but what elevates the storyline is the cinematography. The movie features some epic cinematic shots and camera movements elevating scenes to great heights. A pulsating Screenplay is one of the best, I have come across in the Horror genre in a very long time. Production design, Music, costumes and makeup are top class. The movie is pretty lengthy at 156 minutes but editing is excellent. Almost all the actors have put in a great amount of effort in getting the right emotions, including the supporting actors and the results are pretty amazing for us to see.Overall, The Wailing is one of the rare gems in cinema, which, if I start talking about, I probably would end up writing a thesis sized notebook. In short, it's one of the best horror movie, that I have ever watched. The movie has portrayed the subject of Black magic, occult, voodoo and super natural in the best way possible way, while preserving the audience's believability all along the way. The Wailing is one such movie I can say that, it made me pray that the movie never gets over. Highly recommend for all Horror movie fans around the world. Please view it in a dark atmosphere, preferably after dinner with higher volume for maximum effect. 8.3 stars out of 10 for this magnificent masterpiece, which I will remember for a very long time.",The Wailing
56,shobanchittuprolu,The Wailing is the most disturbing horror masterpiece with 2016's best directional work.Kudos to Hong-Jin Na..,10,29 December 2016,"The Wailing/Goksung (2016): If you are a horror fan then you must be really aware of South Korean horrors because they are best at it.Ever year they release lot of horrors and most of them impresses.This year they already delivered a hit with Train to Busan and now its time for The Wailing.The Wailing already released with widespread critical acclaim and received standing ovation at film festivals.So how is The Wailing?Plot: In the small village Goksung in South Korea, police officer Jong-Goo (Do-won Kwak) investigates bizarre murders caused by a mysterious disease. His partner tells a gossip for him that a Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) that lives in a secluded house in the mountains would be an evil spirit responsible for the illness. Jong-Goo decides to visit the Japanese with his partner and a young priest that speaks Japanese. They find an altar with a goat head and pictures of the infected people that died on the walls. . Jong-Goo finds one shoe of his beloved daughter Hyo-jin (Hwan-hee Kim) in the house of the stranger and soon she becomes sick. His mother-in-law summons the shaman Il-gwang (Jung-min Hwang) to save her granddaughter while a mysterious woman (Woo-hee Chun) tells Jong-Goo that the stranger is the responsible. Who might be the demon that is bringing sickness to Goksung?Plus Points: 1)Screenplay and Direction: The Wailing is the most disturbing scariest horror I had ever seen.This movie is so intense that I took breaks in between such that I can take some breath.Hong-jin Na's direction is award winning.Unlike so much horror cinema, The Wailing doesn't play a gory game of imagine-ifs.It works hard and with serious skill to make you buy into every last twist and shudder of its bizarre, ambiguous plot, which often comes laced with blackly comic farce.Without any jump scares this movie gives the most chilling experience.It's the kind of premise that could have been, and regularly is, stylishly exhausted in 90 minutes flat. But Na structures his story like a police procedural, filling its slow-bubbling two-and-a-half-hour running time with an entire box-set's worth of intrigue and suspense. Climax twist is brilliant and its ambiguous ending lefts us with lot of questions.The scenes of exorcism and sacrifices are disturbing at their best.2)Performances: All of them gave brilliant award winning performances.Do-Wan Kwok,Jung-min Hwang are awesome with their career best performances.3)Music: Background score by Jang Young-gyu is award winning and really helped the movie at lot of scenes.4)Cinematography: This one is also a award winning work in The Wailing.The locations are beautiful but spooky.Minus Points:1)Strictly restricted for weak hearts.Even the daring people may find this movie so disturbing.So,The Wailing is the most disturbing horror masterpiece with 2016's best directional work.Kudos to Hong-Jin Na..My rating 10/10( A Rare Masterpiece in Horror)I dare you guys to watch this movie alone ...I assure you one of the best experiences you will get.",The Wailing

The Film does keep you wandering throughout it,what exactly is going on is it a virus is it something supernatural. At some points it feels like a zombie film , while on the other hand a ghost story. The cast all does a great job including the little girl, there's some of the lines that come from the main lead that are a bit to over exaggerated. There are certain moments where people wait and watch and you feel like someone should be doing something,but yet they're just standing there stupefied what's going on.

58,SyoKennex,Eighth film of my life to be considered a masterpiece,10,21 December 2019,"I don't often use the word masterpiece. I've seen 1,040 films in my life, totalling 1,549 hours of filmography. There's maybe 7 I would label a masterpiece with full usage and definition of the word.The Wailing is the eighth film of one thousand and forty films I very willingly, gladly and without hesitation give the title of Masterpiece to.I'm not too big of a fan of Asian supernatural horror. Whilst I very much enjoy it and give most films a pretty decent average rating, I find a lot of them bleed into one another with similar plots and a very safe view on the supernatural. In Japan it tends to be curses that have people die in mysterious ways, South Korea, a cursed object that has people murder each other are the most common ones I come across.When I clicked The Wailing was supernatural, I prepared myself for a 6 or maybe 7 out of 10 movie that was good but wouldn't hold its own too well in the vast expanse of horror.The Wailing gave me some stunning frames. The cinematography in this is beautiful. The gore frames are gruesome, unadulterated and unapologetic. The ritualism and belief of South Korea are shown in their full glory without fear. Na Hong Jin doesn't shy away from racial tension between the Japanese and South Koreans with a slightly historical take with a beautiful twisting story that left me with my mouth gaping open but still feeling just slightly uncomfortable - something I believe Hong Jin did on purpose. I was shown acting that was so well done, no matter what I watch these actors in from now on, I will always know them from The Wailing. The varying supernatural aspects were unique, something that stunned me, unafraid to step out of genre restrictions and lead the way with something new. With a story line that is intriguing, stunning and just raw, this two and a half hour journey was worth watching.This is a film deserving of the hype that numerous other Asian horrors got but turned out to be predictable messed. THIS is the Korean horror of 2016, the one that should have lead the forefront of South Korean, or even Asian, horror into 2017. This is a film that shows prowess, promise and skill. Hong Jin treats us to such wonderful skills from not just himself but his script writer, his cast, his editing team, his make up team, etc, everyone involved. You can feel the passion and love and pure dedication that went into this movie.A full 10/10 is just not enough for this film.A twisting, numbing, horrifying masterpiece.",The Wailing

Not so here. Not a wasted shot, scene, or character. Everyone cast is perfect for the role they play.I did find it hard to champion the lead as he was clearly a cowardly man. Yet he was a police Sargent! The only times he showed strength was when angry or dealing with what was possessing his daughter. Otherwise he was a cry baby! The other Korean men did not fair much better.Is this an accurate portrayal of men in that culture? I suppose every culture has it's men who are more children than men. Or were they portrayed as such to give the film a comic relief amid the horror?? The Shaman was an exception.Fine story with surprising twists.

Now I understand every scene that this genius director throwing at us. It took him 5 years to make this movie and its impossible to say that he is just creating some random scene here and there to make his movie interesting. For me, this movie is so confusing, you need to think a lot, no, I mean think hard to understand what is really going on here. I can say that this movie is the only one movie in the world that discover some new sub-genre in horror. I called it a mystic-mind- boggling-horror kind of movie. Its so creative, excellent, sneaky, weird and every word in the world that can define what is mystery is will be suit for this movie. Lately Korean cinema just keep making their same old cliché movie like what they always did in the past, (around 90's to 2010++ where people start recognize their movie that have their own interesting style) and its become so repetitive now. So, I hope this movie will set some par for other filmmaker in Korea & of course from all around the world to make a movie that's even better, or have the kind of similar feel with this one.

It's not funny (Why is the first hour a dumb Comedy and then suddenly serious?), the twists and turns come out of complete nowhere, nothing makes any sense, and the ending was like the most obvious crap I had ever seen.Why does it take so long to reach a similar conclusion I've seen countless other Horror films do it in like 90 minutes? What on Demon's Souls did this offer that was so unique to the rest? Why do they not get a free pass and this one does?

64,ctowyi,A Smorgasbord of Many Genres and Near un-Killable Zombies,9,31 July 2016,"SPOILER: This review is extremely difficult to pen without dropping spoilers, but I am going to try...Na Hong-jin's The Chaser (2008) audaciously broke one of cinema's golden rules to heartbreaking effect. His sophomore effort The Yellow Sea (2010) is a pulsating rush of blood and bone. 6 years later comes The Wailing, a gruesome blend of different genres and it is near impossible to pigeonhole. Na Hong-jin has graduated to a whole new level with The Wailing, a smorgasbord of investigative procedural, humour, horror, supernatural, family drama, and near un-killable zombies. Whether you are the filmmaker or the viewer, it can be really hard to start a film. No one sitting in the pitch-black cinema is your friend yet and the beginning of any film always feels like a forced act of intimacy for the viewer. A hooker can help. No, I don't mean a prostitute but a good first scene 😬. The Wailing opens with a verse from the Bible, Luke 24:38-39 and cuts to a scene of a forlorn man double hooking a worm before fishing from a boulder. The scene is beguiling, laden with an atmosphere of dread and your consciousness will immediately lock in the little noggin of information that his unusual act has a higher purpose. Two and a half hours later and after a post-movie long table discussion with 13 other animated persons and more than a day of further discussion on a WhatsApp chat group, I am wiser. The first scene of The Wailing is a blue-ribbon winner and so it goes for the rest of the film. The big story is easy - a Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) arrives in a little village and soon a mysterious sickness starts to spread. Grisly murders ensue and a strange young woman (Chun Woo-Hee) and a bombastic shaman (Hwang Jung-Min) enter into the fray. A bumbling and lazy policeman (Kwak Do Won) is drawn in and he has to get to the crux of the mystery in order to save his daughter. It is the intricate workings of the plot that needs a lot of unpacking. Forget about the age-old Hollywood adage that a good film has a plot that is easily summarised. The last time I had so much fun dismantling and assembling back a movie was Inception!The Wailing is a stupendous and sustained piece of masterful storytelling. It is loaded with frightful incidents and stuffed with mystifying characters. On top of that, it is genuinely terrifying as it preys on the goodness of ordinary people. God has seemingly excused Himself from the battleground as can be gleaned from a scene in which the church says it will not lift a finger to help. The story is compelling and riveting, and every twist, turn and outcome totally earned. The movie has a punishing runtime of 156 minutes not because of poor pacing, but because of the intricacies of the plot. There are plenty of bloody scenes for the gore-hounds but they are never ladled out to pump up a sagging plot. The plot never sags, not even for one instance. Na's use of music and sounds to heighten the suspense is brilliant. From plaintive tonal chords in the beginning to a full-blown thunderous ""tong tong qiang"" exorcism ritual, everything adds to the atmosphere of doom. Na has also achieved such sublime tonal shifts that I didn't even notice where I went from laughing out loud to pure heart-parked-in-my-mouth terror. The film is suffused with motifs, religious overtones and thematically rich. Even an innocuous scene of a young woman throwing stones has biblical weight. The storytelling is powerful and the twists perfectly angled into the story. So many times I had that ""aha"" feeling that told me I had the mystery figured out and the motivations of the characters down pat. But on hindsight, I realised the only thing I had figured out early is that this is one incredibly thought provoking piece of filmmaking. The Wailing practically roars through the final act delivering all manners of monstrosity and heartbreaking sadness with aplomb. The movie is long and rich, multilayered and satisfying. Prepare to be toyed, skewered, gutted, stabbed and get ready to be played like a violin. I know this review is rubbish and ladened with hyperboles, but I did not exaggerate or embellish, and I did you a huge favour by remaining vague with the plot. Believe me, it is extremely hard for me to do that. I know good films when I see them. It is the great ones that are not easy to decide on. The Wailing is not a great film in the strictest sense but it earns its place on a shelf of illustrious films that invite so many good debates with like- minded minds. These are films that are impossible for you to stay shut-up and have everything explained in a few by-lines. These are films that will never leave your head long after they are done, and when you least expect it the tendrils of the narrative will rise up and wrap around your consciousness like tentacles. There are not many films on this particular shelf and all of them have become classics. I do not use the word ""classic"" lightly, but I believe The Wailing may well prove to be one. You know how I know? The movie left more questions than answers in my mind, but yet it was never a frustrating cinematic experience. It is such a wonderful mindfcuk! The year is not over yet, but I have a feeling I will not see another film of this caliber. Films of this type are rare and such superb rare films wail out to be watched and experienced.

One hour later, it occurred to me that this disaster of storytelling still had an hour to run... which, unfortunately, I sat through like a severe test of patience.Come the ending, I honestly wish I hadn't bothered and that more negative - sorry, realistic - reviews/comments of this overly long, dire mess of a film were being published, as I felt both cheated by the hype and resentful for the time invested in such crap.Note to nerds: not everything from Korea is a ""masterpiece""; sadly, this film is a great example.",The Wailing
66,spencergrande6,"There Is No Ask, Only Feel",7,14 December 2016,"I kept having to pause this which I don't recommend as a way of watching this film; it's almost entirely based on the total buy-in of mind, body and soul into the atmosphere and action presented within. Losing that ride through the world, having to re-enter it and engage mentally again creates a disconnect and a discordance.The plot is either nonsensical beyond belief or so stupidly straight- forward considering its running time that that's the only reasonable explanation. I don't know.I do know that the seance/exorcism scene is incredible and hypnotic, even as you realize you don't understand what it is the shaman is doing; not that you're meant to in this case, but it's an apt metaphor for the whole film.",The Wailing
67,sitenoise,"The good, the bad, and the awful",8,20 September 2016,"First of all, Hong-jin Na is the man; this is an amazing film and may be one of the best horrors of the last ten years--which may be saying more about the genre than the film.I think I can do this without spoiling.If you don't know what style underpants Japanese and Korean men wear, or which side of the road they drive on, not to mention who gets to cast the first stone or how many times a rooster burps, you might not 'get' this film. Religion is a spongy thing, from Shamans to the resurrected, and from scamming palm readers to the truly omniscient, they all speak and act ambiguously. So there's that.Kudos to start: The Shaman rituals are wonderful and intense, the music is so good. The zombie scene, just WOW, even though it teeters close to ""okay, there's six of us and one of him, lets try to get him one at a time"" dumbness. Kwak Do-Won, like so many of the blubbery Korean actors I enjoy, is great with only a few errors, probably the director's fault. The little girl really does ""bring it"". Jun Kunimura, though problematic overall as the 'Japanese' man, has a couple scenes of such commitment and beauty (the photographers, makeup people, and director get some credit) my jaw hit the floor.One eyebrow raised: Films of subtle depth and substance should also be enjoyable on a superficial level to be great. This film is that, for the most part. BUT. There's a fine line between intentionally misdirecting your audience and being thoughtfully ambiguous. Hong-jin Na is a little wobbly on that line. I think this is the weakest of his three films.The film is edited questionably. There are several scenes that all of a sudden aren't there any more and we're onto/into the next one leaving us to think: ""How did they get out of that one""? This can be an effective technique or a sign that things haven't been thought through completely. This film isn't very fluid, imo.Spankings: In the horror genre, or otherwise, it's disappointing when there's a scary scene that ends up being a dream--doubly so if someone later asks 'Was it a dream?' or says with authority: 'It wasn't a dream'. There's a big scary scene that happens in this flick that just doesn't make sense for it to convert to a dream, unless the guy woke up where he was in the dream. It invalidates what happened right before it and during it.The foot chase. This is a staple of many horrors and others. It's akin to the gun fight: stupid. When a hobbled old man, shown stumbling and falling down, can still outrun six capable, younger men, I'm gonna puke. I might even punt a film based on that, as this makes me lose lots of respect for the film maker and his/her choices.Back to the underpants. I'm sure there are lots of 'tells' in the film I didn't get. Lots of them. But and So, even missing all of them, and even though I ask for an obvious 'tell' if/when the subtleties may be lost, the big obvious 'reveal' in this film is so clumsy I felt a big ""Boo"" well up from inside.I'm on board with a film that might not make sense, might even frustrate while experiencing it in real time, and only reveals its true depth after it's over and you think about it and put all the puzzle pieces together. An example would be *Spider Forest*, a film I totally didn't 'get' while I was watching it, but felt enthused and excited about trying to make sense of it. When The Wailing ended I was glad it was over.Don't get me started on the ""Why is this happening?"" question. You really have to make stuff up for the answer in the film to that question to make sense.",The Wailing
68,deastman_uk,Bad mushrooms,6,19 December 2016,"This continues the chain of great Korean films that thankfully come over to the West. Violence, intrigue and somewhat strange pacing all play their part.This horror film plays with aspects of ghosts and shamanism, when bad mushrooms are blamed for something that looks far worse. There are reminders of things as far apart as Peter Jackson's Braindead and Spanish horror film Rec.One aspect to watch out for is the use of an initially pathetic character in the lead role, a device used to lead you into the happenings in the small town of Goksung.

They could and should have cut off some of the talking scenes and ""comedic"" scenes and make this movie just 2 hours. It would have been perfect. This movie is slightly uneven because it is very dark and serious, but then there would be weird comedic scenes such a a group of villagers beating up a zombie-like person ""Shaun of The Dead"" style. This scene goes on and on. This movie has an amazing ending though, and it is very bleak. It deals with Satan, Angels, discrimination, and morality. There is no light in this movie.

73,MattBirk,A Top 5 Movie of 2016,9,7 December 2016,"* Disclaimer - If you are familiar with South Korean Cinema you should come to expect some silly/oddball humor thrown into a serious thriller (which this film is). Most will find it off putting and I admit I too at times find it rather off putting. But once you get past those moments early on in the movie (an epic 2.5 hour runtime), you'll be rewarded with one of the year's best films!* The movie is all about the foreboding sense that something sinister is coming. Numerous scenes tease this feeling and it's simply bliss. Characters interact with the antagonist early on and you know it's a mistake that is sure to have consequences. It's refreshing to see this type of structure.* ""The Wailing"" is one of the best movies of the year. Period. It features one of the best exorcism scenes of all time, mostly thanks to a cultural difference (coming from outside the USA). The movie leads you in one direction only to pull the rug out from under your feet and throw you in a new direction. It's a movie that keeps you guessing till the final frame, never letting you get too comfortable trusting any specific character. The deceit and misdirection in the movie is simply brilliant! *** An impressive 9/10 (only negatives are those 'silly' comedic relief scenes that feel completely out of place at times) ***",The Wailing
74,Endless_01,Astonishing take on the horror genre.,8,5 June 2019,"After a strange stranger moved into the neighborhoods of a small town, strange things begin to happen between people, violent things and macabre things.The Wailing is an exceptionally created scary movie. With an atmosphere worthy of Asian terror, our show also shows a new macabre shot in the main plot, having extremely disturbing images and scenes with extreme violence. She manages to satisfy the basic expectations of any film of her genre, but also marks herself among her style by her fantastic narrative, teaching us different options through the film through the same eyes. That's an important factor of the film, the plot turns. Very few scary movies manage to keep themselves as ''unpredictable'', The Wailing manages to stay completely between a cloud of mystery and horror, filling up with mystery every second and revealing some completely fantastic plot turns.With a beautiful scenography, fantastic performances typical of Korean cinema, with incredible sound design and some terrifying shots without overuse themselves, this film manages to cede among the classics of terror offering us a unique and demonic experience like never seen before. An excellent example of the capacity of Korean cinema and a masterpiece for the genre of terror, especially among Asian cinema, totally respectable and enjoyable.",The Wailing

I had put off watching this one for a long while as it was just so long I knew I needed to have a good night to focus and really absorb it. Needless to say that wasn't hard at all. I was hooked within the first 5 mins and didn't look up from the screen until it ended. Between the excellent acting, the well constructed story, the steady flowing suspense and the breathtaking scenery there wasn't a minute that I was not completely enthralled in this story. I love horror movies, all kinds... Even some of the cheesy ones, but its always an exciting moment when I find one that is completely satisfying from start to finish.The only part I had a hard time with was when he killed the Cane Corso, but I'm a mega serious animal lover that has to admit I always have a harder time with the animals demise in horror movies than I do the people's.

78,seige-hound,"A Fantastic, creepy, engaging horror film that doesn't outstay its welcome",10,28 June 2018,"The biggest strength the Wailing has is how deeply entrenched the story is in the setting. This film would not work in any other setting, because the story needs a town in South Korea to work, as the entire plot relies on South Korea's culture and history.The story begins as a police drama mystery, with our protagonist, Jong Goo, a bumbling, clumsy police officer and family man, who is confronted by a sudden increase in violence and murder in the town, which is seemingly linked to the arrival of a mysterious Japanese man. But as the film progresses, the story transforms into a supernatural horror film that is deeply entrenched in both Buddhist and Christian ideas of demons and the supernatural. When Jong Goo's daughter gets sick with what he believes to be a sickness linked to the supernatural, Jong enlists the help of both a Catholic deacon and a local Shaman to help him figure out what is going on, and how he can stop it.The horror aspects of the film truly shine out, with a next-to zero percent reliance on jump scares, the creepiness of the film comes through in slow pans, confronting gory scenes, closeups of things that aren't quite what they seem, and a sense of dread that builds consistently over the 2 1/2 hour running time.Right up to the end credits is a guessing game of who is responsible for the occurances of the film, and when the truth is finally revealed, it ties the entire film together. What once seemed contradictory now makes sense within the context of the full film.In conclusion, if you want something that will hold your attention for 2 1/2 hours, this film is a fantastic use of your time, and will keep you engaged for the full run time.",The Wailing

Here is mine. We start off with a bumbling, Keystone-like cop, but a good family man. In fact, he is told he ""wears little girl pants and has balls the size of peas"" because apparently he is very cowardly. Until he realizes his daughter is in danger among the strange happenings in the village, and the one, lone strange man who happens to be the instigator - or is it just a coincidence that he should arrive in town at that time? There are times The Japanese man seems innocent, almost frail. Other times, he seems like an evil force to be reckoned with. As the town falls deeper into hysteria, the people become more desperate, as is always the case when fear rules. Other dark characters emerge - a beautiful ghost woman, and a Shaman. The father does not know who to trust as his daughter becomes more and more endangered. Everyone is suspicious, no one has answers, and fear and judgment have begun to rule the town.

I believe there is ambiguity in good or evil because there are no clear lines much like with real people. I think this is some kind of universe where there are unknown supernatural entities operating on their own, manipulating people as pawns and meddling in each other's business along the way. It is unclear who is lying versus telling the truth, working together or completely separately, choosing victims randomly or with reasons, etc. Maybe the woman was truthful and the shaman and Japanese man were in cahoots. Or maybe the Japanese man was truly a shaman, died in the car wreck, and was ultimately possessed or provided another vessel for the shaman or whatever empowered him. I don't think any logic can tie everything and everyone together so this is the most sensible solution in my mind.

86,o_s_k_r,OK here's my opinion,7,20 October 2016,"I think this could very easily have been a 10/10 movie ranked amongst the greatest horrors of all time. However the director appears to have been given slightly too much power. Rather than create a gripping, punchy narrative we instead get an arty conflicting narrative with a ""make your own interpretation"" ending. The movie is also considerably too long.I think the movie should have been heavily edited by the producers - it should have been cut down to around two hours. The strongest narrative strand was the one with the female ghost. Parts of the story that conflicted with this should have been altered. The zombie scene for example could have been made to fit with this narrative, it's a great scene though I wouldn't have cut it entirely. Also the photos needed to be explained - maybe the Japanese guy is actually keeping the zombies from returning to life? Then of course we need a punchier ending. I think it was of dubious taste to insert some Christian themes. There was NO GOOD REASON for the guy to trust the female ghost, a couple of Jesus references in no way can compensate for how suspicious she had behaved previously - she had made the shaman spew blood lets not forget (and the Shaman had appealed to Buddha for help). Lead character has developed some courage and stamina and is no longer just a wimp. He flees home to his family ready to crack skulls. Final battles rages, shaman and ghost are both killed perhaps? Priest character shows up from hospital and helps out too?OK, so I hear you say - it wasn't suppposed to be that sort of movie.But the rest of the movie was AMAZING - It could have appealed to EVERYBODY. Entertainment is still what most people are looking for in a movie. It didn't have to entirely make sense, but just make more sense than it did..... then in a few years from now, the director could have reduced his own two and a half hour cut of the movie with the interpration ending.",The Wailing
87,RileyOnFilm,The perfect dark journey you want in a horror film,10,4 December 2017,"A small village is the setting for this terrifying horror movie from South Korea. At well over two hours, it plays with its viewers and weaves clues to a mystery.Another Korean film from the same year, Train to Busan, offered us a father/daughter relationship that touched our hearts. Both are slightly different in their journeys and plot but it is a powerful force that bonds these mean together with their little sweethearts. The evil force that threatens the policeman's daughter here is shifty and hard to understand. It takes the father on a quest of love that promises to harm his physical body and perhaps his soul. Will his daughter be saved? That's the question that keeps coming up.The policeman is the star of this film. There are a few scenes with his that are definitely Oscar worthy. In a horror film you sometimes need a voice of reason to identify with. But what about when that voice you're following starts losing touch with reality? That can be a scary thing.Then, there is this evil force. Who is it? A ghost as the shaman says? This film is not just horror but also a mystery to be guessed at which, if you like mysteries as I do, makes it a lot of fun. This mysterious, sleepy horror mystery tale should not be spoiled. If you have not seen it and these themes interest you, I encourage you to watch it. If you have seen it, I think you'll agree it is one of the more powerful horrors of its year (2016).

88,baehr_adam,A Horror Film Tour De Force.,10,7 February 2017,I will start off by saying that Korean Films are by far my favorite films and though I haven't seen every single one the ones I have seen have been cemented into memory as Masterpieces. The film is directed by Na Hong-jin and this is the first movie I have seen of his but his third major directed film. The story centers on a village that is being plagued by sickness and running rampant with heinous crimes. The main character who is a cop is trying to find a way to stop what is going on as so to save his daughter. The acting was excellent with Do-Won Kwaki who plays the cop Jong-goo and Hwan-hee Kim playing the daughter Hyo-Jin. They do a great job and so do all of the other cast members. The one thing I have come to love about Foreign films especially Korean ones is how much raw emotion and talent they can portray in a movie with actors I know nothing about and that they can pull you into caring deeply about these people. I also like how the cops aren't Americanized. I mean as someone who is an American citizen the cops are portrayed as militant and bullies to a degree and here they are portrayed as docile being that they have no real weapons and being in a small village and they're not prepared to handle what is going on with the current state of affairs. The action is invigorating. I mean the heart of this 2.5 hour movie is a straight tension filled drama with some very well crafted action scenes but don't come into this movie thinking it's a John Wick or even close. I would say think the movie Seven. The cinematography is gorgeous with each shot being meticulously edited and put onto film. The locale is beautiful and makes you want to re-watch it again just to feast your eyes on it for a second time. I will conclude with saying that this is definitely in my new favorite Top 10 horror films of all time and as someone who is a horror fanatic like myself that is a bold statement. I'm glad I didn't review this movie immediately after watching it but waited about a day because the ending will make you side one of two ways obviously and at first I didn't like it. I waited and read some remarks on google about the ending and came up with my own theory. The movie has an Inception feel to it and I will leave it at that but I can say you don't want to skip this film. I find it to be fresh and tasteful and worth a watch at least once. Don't let not liking to read subtitles waylay your interest. The fundamental theory behind this movie is about a man in a Quandary of a situation but surrounded by religious connotations.,The Wailing

90,daryopeek,Too mysterious to be loveable,7,23 February 2019,"The Wailing is quite a movie due to many Internet lists about best K-Horror, begin to insert the title among the classic ones like A Tale of Two Sisters and Whispering Corridors series. While I didn't quite taste the amazingness after watch the movie, the analysis around my head after few days justify the lack of ending.Focus on a village that attacked by mysterious plague; when people suddenly turns crazy and murder his/her family, a police investigates the case while his daughter is slowly corrupted by the plague.My first salutation is given to the main character, the police. He is unlike what we encounter in a horror or any movies that have the zero to hero movement (or stays zero), but this MC (main character) has his own violent and fragile sides that happen in the movie interchangeably. This is usually a character that die first in zombie or slasher movies, but it's until you realize that the police is us, after all. While the presentation feels comedic at the first place, it evolves when the situation becomes more complex.The story is quite intriguing first, because there are many hints and clues you can perceive in many ways. I think this is the strongest point and also the weakest, because each time the mysterious bar arises, the story begins to give more question. Sure, for those who can interpret those hints easily, it's a nice ride, but to be the audience who wandering so many why, the unresolved questions buffer the climax and ending scene excitement.While the narration gives an impression of your standard horror movie, many articles/threads in the net conclude this movie is full of hidden meanings, hence make you more interested. If those meanings were intended by the writer, sure it's works, but I think to staple the symbols into quite a realistic narration, it's difficult to appreciate the movie more.I think it's appropriate to call Mother! which included in my Perfect 10 list, as a comparison. Mother! leaves us in unworldly scenes that make the symbols vivid, as opposed to The Wailing with odd ending and rather unfitting to the nature of the movie. It's probably best if you watch it twice to get all details.For those who loves a Korean horror film with hidden details and lots of mystery, I feel The Wailing can be one of the best choices.

I don't find them even a little scary at all. This is because of real personal experience in dealing with these types of kids. Not possessions, but kids people can't understand and/or deal with. I have dealt with dozens of kids, many are far worse in real life. None of whom are actually demon possessed. That 'scary' scene just makes me laugh.The next big loss is that the story actually loses a lot of ambiguity towards the third act, and the story forces you to see only one limited viewpoint from that moment to the end.

It may not be completely original and has some flaws. But the acting is excellent, the location is perfect for this type of a horror/macabre tale and the dialogue is always reasonably engaging.In summary, something or someone is killing the people in a local small town. It's uncertain what is happening and who is behind it. Is it madness? A disease? But it also appears that some of the local people are killing each other and for an unknown reason, potentially some type of madness. Our protagonist is a police officer and his daughter becomes one of the afflicted. He tries to find an answer and also save his daughter from being another victim.This is a pretty long film and at some point you wonder if it's really worth the payoff. And it gets surprisingly bloody at certain points too. It takes its twists and turns and it is engaging. The ending and meaning itself was very confusing to me.

I adore Korean cinema and find that a lot of their thrillers go beyond the norm. A Tale of Two Sisters made me keep the lights on and Lady Vengeance was as beautiful as it was haunting. This one had a huge promise from the beginning, but the needless amount of ""twists n turns"" made what was aimed to be a movie that relied on atmosphere nuance become a weird game of Clue with evil spirits. It's like if someone had made the perfect dinner then wasn't happy with it so they decide to add more salt: it's excessive at the end, so as a result all of the heavy atmosphere and eeriness in the beginning gets depleted. I would be interested in seeing what Hong-jin Na has in store, but in the meantime I will have a gander at Yellow Sea and The Chaser. Oh yeah, and last I just want to add that the little girl that played Jong-goo's daughter MADE the movie.

Thrown in is a mysterious woman dressed in white who make casual apparitions to ward off the evil afflicting the community
I found the film interesting though the director purposely seem to leave the film without a resolution. His message is kind of you see and react to what you believe in whatever affliction you are undergoing through. The change of tones from comedy to drama to tragedy are masterfully done, however from dramedy to zombie film to revenge story and back and forth seem jarring

Unfortunately I feel like pretty much more than half the runtime should have been cut. ""The Wailing"" circles around in a seemingly endless ""who done it"" or, to be more precise, ""who is it"" and even though the acting of our lead Do-won Kwak was not too bad, the dialogues bothered me constantly. I find myself repeating this for about every Asian movie and I assume it must be a cultural thing. I mostly find the talk so generic and pointless, that you could reduce some movies to 5-10 important lines and let them be quiet for the entire rest of the runtime. And this movie is no different. The best acting performance was delivered by Jun Kunimura, who not only presented a great play with mimic, but also refused to talk much (I bet he knew I would appreciate that). The cinematography was pretty good and I liked the realistic appearing gore effects. Not so much on the ""possessed zombies"" but therefore on the crime scenes and such.

As others have noted, the first part of this long film has almost a comedic tone before things really get serious. And having lived in S. Korea and having a Korean wife, I understand most of the cultural differences we see as American viewers. For example, as a smaller, much more homogeneous society, with a much lower crime rate, policemen often don't carry guns and see violent crime as an aberration and not just an excuse to crack skulls, lock up everyone in sight and pile on as many charges as possible. Still, after the young girl stabbed the baby sitter, I think she would have been institutionalized for further observation. This move would have removed her from her part in the bloody finale.As for the supernatural back and forth honestly, I have zero supernatural superstitions or beliefs, so the filmmaker must build a strong, logical and coincidental case to get my buy in. This movie doesn't do that, so at the end of the day, it all comes off as pretty silly and yawn inducing--much like a similar American movie which also garnered raves, The Witch.

109,auberus,Do we really understand the true nature of God?,7,21 April 2020,"""The Strangers"" from Hong-Jin Na is a thriller horror film. We all remember the very good 2008 ""The Chaser"" from the same director who won best Director and best film at the 45th Grand Bell Awards. ""The Chaser"" is probably one of his best works to date and one of the best thriller horror movies of recent years. I strongly advise to give it a watch. But let's go back to ""The Strangers"" aka ""The Wailing"".
Release in 2016 the film depicts a series of strange events and the spread of a mysterious disease happening in a little South Korean village soon after the arrival of a Japanese stranger. The film begins with an excerpt from the Bible. Luke 24:38, to be precise: ""Why are you troubled"" Jesus asked, ""and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself."" Then we see the first shot involving a fisherman hanging worms on the hook of his fishing rod. Those details may seem unimportant but believe me they are the keys to understand this story of demonic possession and trickery between our revealed world and the hidden one.
In 156 minutes Hong-Jin Na explores through the eye of a policeman and his family the nature of men when face against irrational and obscure events. The result is a slow burning movie riddled with tension, horror, a sense of loss of control over the events but also funny parts and clownish characters who struggle to make sense of what is happening to them. If Life was a game where traps are set by hidden entities only for humans to fall into it, then ""The Strangers"" could be the very depiction of this game. The film bates us with the story of a bizarre stranger who seems confronted against racism only to reshuffle the cards half way with stories of bizarre strangers manipulating our belief or/and our superstitions and questioning the very nature of what we believe in. Nothing is what it seems to be...
""The Strangers"" is not a perfect movie, too long, unbalanced, hesitating on what the film wants to be, it's probably one of Hong-Jin Na less controlled film. However this lack of control is largely offset by the originality of its subject, the questioning the movie leads to and the horror it inserts in our mind, on par if not more subtle than what ""The Exorcist"" proposed a few decades earlier. It's definitely not for everyone but if you like unsettling movies then ""The Strangers"" is for you and will leave you with one haunting question: do we really understand the true nature of God?",The Wailing

113,ethantoy,What a bizarre film!,8,27 June 2021,"The Wailing is one of those films that left me confused, disturbed, and relieved. I must say that the film's premise is surprisingly involving, and it is a good story altogether. However, this movie had me thoroughly confused through the majority of its runtime- it's a very lengthy film, and albeit, too long. I think the only problems I had with the film was the tone and the writing. Most of the movie's beginning act, almost seems like a black comedy. Then the last act becomes pure horror. It's awesome to see comedy being instilled into a good horror film, but it can be harrowing and confusing at times when certain things arise. I'd say I'd go as far as to claim this movie is a Evil Dead without the Deadites.With that being said: it's a great film. There's a lot of good elements and good characterization in this. The movie knows what it's setting out to accomplish and it knows what it wants to be. I just found myself scratching my head at some of the decisions that would come of it- especially during the comedic parts.I think my biggest gripe, is simply the plot, and its convoluted story that becomes increasingly confusing. It goes from a simple detective-thriller, into a religious-demonic film, the shift is so sudden and off the walls, that eventually I found myself just trying to keep up with who was who.All in all, I did enjoy the movie- I believe it requires a lot of viewings (but the runtime is what may be a major flag for some) and there may be a underlying plot element you'll spot from early on that helps the story formulate itself. It's funny, it's bleak, it's disturbing, and most important of all in a horror film: it's scary. You can't go wrong with The Wailing, it's a investment of a film and it's clearly aiming to freak its audience out, but it gives you bits and pieces so that you stay inside the world it's built and that to me, is a good horror film. I'd recommend it, but I'd also recommend watching this several times to fully grasp its message and true storyline. It's confusing, but it is good.",The Wailing
114,julesfdelorme,Way better than you might expect,9,16 February 2018,"The Wailing (Gok-seung)
I've had a lot of time on my hands of late. Stuck in bed mostly, I've been watching a lot of TV and a lot of movies. Some of it good. Some of it bad. And a bit of it surprising.
The Korean film Gok-seung, The Wailing, was one of those surprising things for me. It's one of those types of movies that I think we should be talking about a lot more than we generally do. It's so easy to talk about the big budget main stream films. So many of us, though, tend to overlook the smaller budget films, particularly from markets that we don't pay very much attention to when it comes to movies. 
Some Japanese films have captured mainstream attention, from the wonderful Akira Kurosawa films of the past, shlocky monster movies like Godzilla, Manga, Anime and Animation works, and horror movies like The Ring. Too many of those movies got badly remade by Hollywood, though The Magnificent Seven, For a Few Dollars More and even Star Wars managed to take Kurosawa's work and make pretty good movies out of them.
This has also been true of some Northern European films and television series, particularly Sweden, though they too have a long history of ""art film"" prestige, and an unfortunate history of bad or just less powerful Hollywood remakes.
But smaller, lesser known markets, like Korea, or Iran and so many other countries with burgeoning film industries, too often get overlooked. And movies that do not qualify as ""art film"" get even more overlooked, probably because they do not appeal to our inner snobs and do not make for good ""Look how smart and cultured I am."" types of references.
South Korea has in fact been making its own interesting horror and science fiction films for a while now. This undoubtedly has a similar source of inspiration as the American science fiction films and Japanese monster movies of the 50s and 60s: an intimate relationship and natural paranoia about the possibility of very real annihilation, of a hidden enemy that might very well actually exist, in this case due to the proximity to the unstable North Korean government. This has led to a very similar type of undertone that made movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing or Godzilla much better than they should have been.
Gok-seung, The Wailing is a great example of just this type of movie.
On the surface it starts out seeming like another zombie/possession movie, though with a surprising mix of comic characterization mixed in. The lead character is an overweight, mildly incompetent, and not at all heroic cop in a small mountain village where some odd, possibly supernatural deaths take place. Do-won Kwak, as Jong-goo is not exactly what you would picture as a leading man. But his pock marked fleshy face is both wonderfully expressive when he needs it to be and a blank almost mindless mask at other times, calling to mind the wonderful Japanese/Korean actor and director Takeshi Kitano, particularly in the way that he relates to the world around him and his fellow human beings. 
Except for his daughter Hyo-jin, played wonderfully by Hwan-hee Kim. She is the polar opposite of her father. She is sweet, full of life and of a surprising level of mature honesty and wisdom. Jong-goo clearly adores his daughter. When he is in her presence he melts. He emanates a deep uncynical fatherly love. He is a different human being when he is with her. 
So we know of course that Hyo-jin will play a major role, but we don't exactly how, and we definitely do not know how interesting the course that the movie will take, because at first it seems like such an obvious genre film.
It's not.
Even when the story begins to unfold, and we think we know what the movie is about, it manages to surprise. And like those great movies of the 50s and 60s, Gok-seung has a surprisingly deep undertow, reflecting those American science fiction films in the way that the characters must struggle with the question of how exactly we can tell the difference between good and evil.
It's also refreshing to see characters freak out when faced with the weird and the supernatural. If we're being completely honest about of it, how many of us would end up squealing and curled up in a ball if we were actually faced with flesh eating ghouls or demons? It's nice for once, and often very funny, to watch people actually do that.
The Wailing could easily pass as just a better than average horror movie, and can easily be appreciated as nothing more than that.
It's funny. It's entertaining. It's pretty creepy at times. And it's pretty shlocky at other times.
But The Wailing, much like its main characters, is also far smarter than it seems to be. 
So, watch it if you like horror movies, if you like comedy, or if you just like to be entertained.
But maybe, when you're done just enjoying Gok-seung, The Wailing, take a brief moment to appreciate how much better a film it was than it seemed to be.
You can find it on Netflix.
Maybe it's not for everyone out there.
But I think more of you are going to like it than you might first think.
You might even be able to brag to your friends a bit that you've found a film that they didn't know anything about. They may not be as impressed as they might be if you had watched a Kurosawa or Bergman film.
But that's okay.
Art isn't always that much fun.
But not everything has to be Art to be very very good.
The Wailing isn't Art.
Not by a long shot.
But it is very good.
And it's fun.
We should be talking more about movies like Gok-seung, The Wailing.
And we should be far less ashamed of having fun.
Because sometimes fun can be smart too.",The Wailing
115,heath-jeffrey,Impressive build up to...,4,30 July 2016,"I'm not going to mention any specifics about the plot or characters at all, but I do discuss the general orientation of the ending. (ie. Stop reading if you think general might still be spoiling).I so much want to give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10. The acting was strong (especially from the child actor); the scenery and both overall setting and specific settings for particular scenes helped set just the right mood at the right time; there was a good dip into traditional local customs; and running alongside the plot were several themes related to important social and moral concerns (racism being the biggest one). A powerful combination.But, what really caught me and held me throughout the movie was the mystery. Multiple characters and events would lead you to suspect the antagonist was a particular person or thing, just before something lead you in a different direction. At many points, you have two or more suspicions and are just waiting to confirm which is right. Thoroughly engaging despite the length of the movie.And then, in the last 5-10 minutes, when you are waiting for all the strings to pull together... waiting for that 'aha' moment... waiting for the climax...Nothing really happens. You're left with a vague ending; half your suspicions thrown to the wind, rather than tidied up; and some extra strings (most of which don't fit with the rest of the plot) tossed on top just to keep you more confused. What was 95% a highly intriguing thriller/mystery of a horror story, died a horrible death in the 5% art-house that was the ending. Ultimately, a terrible movie that I could not recommend to anyone.",The Wailing

119,bonsai-superstar,Curiously overrated,5,10 July 2020,"Strange. Take 10 minutes to check all the reviews here. The cautious reader will notice a large amount of repetition in the wording of reviews, allegedly by different people. The word ""masterpiece"" is thrown around quite a bit and many gave this film a 9 or 10 out of 10. I am here to say that this is not a perfect film as claimed by these reviews.Go ahead. Give this movie half an hour. Do you agree it's a masterpiece yet? If you're worried about unfairly judging it, sacrifice the whole 2-and-a-half hours of your life. If you believe it's a masterpiece as alleged by that point, please post your review explaining why.My issues:* As pointed out by many reasonable viewers on this site, the main characters were laughable - Korean keystone cops! Literally falling around on the ground, screaming and yelling at every opportunity, and just generally doing a poor job. Hello writers - your protagonist has to be relatable and no-one wants to relate to a bumbling fool.* Which reminds me - to preemptively shut up the patronizing racists who gave this movie a 10 out of 10 (!!!) simply because it's Korean / ""foreign"", no, it's not a cultural difference thing. Memories of Murder was a great Korean film featuring cops that suffered few if any of the ridiculous flaws that this alleged masterpiece has.* The movie didn't know if it wanted to be a comedy, action, horror, thriller, mystery, or....anything. Many simple tropes are thrown around, most with no clear resolution.* Uh, The Irishman was too long - and this ain't no Irishman. There is no excuse for dragging this mess on for 2 1/2 hours. Poor editing.* Terrible writing. What was the point of the priest and / or the shaman? Was the villain a Japanese guy just because of racism? What was the real story with the female ghost? Was the kid still haunted at the end? Whatever happened with the dude in the pickup truck? Come on - after giving hours of our lives to this thing at least throw some basic answers our way.Stay cautious. Most critical reviews are trying to warn / help you. The glowing reviews are almost certainly shills or idiots ( 10 out of 10? Really?). Don't waste your time like I did.

121,NormanCroucher,A film for those who like their horror films abstract,7,9 October 2017,"'The Wailing' takes you by the hand and leads you deep into the woods. This is a South Korean horror film that doesn't actually reveal that it is a horror film until it is deep into the wilderness of its story. It melds folklore, cultural superstitions and religious mythology to explore themes of faith and fear, and how ultimate evil can be seen as something akin to a virus that infects and consumes, before moving onto the next host.This is a deeply fascinating mood piece that recalls the brooding atmosphere of Bong Joon-ho's 'Memories of Murder' and the enigmatic mysteries of Michael Haneke's 'Hidden', with spectacular scenery as the backdrop to some gruesome goings-on. What starts off like a pretty standard procedural investigative thriller goes through a remarkable metamorphosis across its (fairly lengthy) runtime. In a nutshell: A bumbling but endearing small town cop begins investigating a series of crimes that point to some kind of homicidal hysteria sweeping through his community, and all roads lead to a mysterious stranger who has taken up residence in the local woodlands. That's all you need to know going in and, to be honest, that's all you really know for sure coming out. The story winds its way through to some pretty unexpected and unsettling places, but spends its first half hour setting-up the foundations of an intriguing mystery while also being surprisingly funny, and it is this quirky humour that lulls the viewer into a false sense of security as a result. The comedy soon dies out and the disquiet sets in, plus the authentic performances from the cast keep it all grounded and lend the whole experience a reality, no matter how bizarre events get.There are answers in the film as to what is happening, why it is happening and who is orchestrating things and to what end, but the film has been intentionally designed to obfuscate any sense of certainty. Even when things are being explained, nothing is explained. Even when it feels like we are witnessing revelation, nothing is revealed. Writer/director Na Hong-jin wants us to work hard in order to drink from the well of deeper meaning. He is indeed exploring the notions of evil as a disease, superstition as a science, and faith as simple perception. In fact, he makes the supernatural somewhat prosaic, which calls into question how we are viewing events and how much of it is real, how much of it is magic, and how much is simply allegory and metaphor for the filmmaker's own spiritual discourse. Either way, whatever it all means, Na Hong-jin expertly unravels the tale at a methodical pace, like bait danging on a hook in the water until we bite and he reels us in with expert timing. But, much like a fish literally out of water, it's a bewildering and confounding experience at the end of the line. I am uncertain if the confusion is partly a symptom of the somewhat muddled plotting or if the ambiguity was perhaps an afterthought (the film apparently was in the editing room for a year and intentionally cut out some context), but it doesn't really matter all that much since the overall experience is so spellbinding.The closing moments, as with many scenes in the film, are both despairingly fatalistic and thought-provoking, and I guarantee almost anyone who watches it will jump on Google at their earliest convenience and type in: 'The Wailing explained'. You'll find theories, ideas, interviews and reviews on there, and gorging yourself on the thoughts of others might help edify your mind, but nothing will comfort your soul once you've looked into the eyes of the devil.",The Wailing

I'd describe it as a supernatural modern mystery fable with horror elements and dark comedy, the tone really does vary though. The comedic dialogue and slapstick moments peppered throughout gave it a slightly goofy feel in places but there's plenty of dark imagery and nasty violence too. It's all wonderfully shot and well acted which definitely keeps it engaging.

Ryan Reynolds was awfully charming in the movie, but that was all. It's just the same old story and plot that has been served a lot. The Wailing, on the other hand, it's still fresh and serves brand new tastes for movie fans which probably is the reason why many people have been praising and recommending this movie. This movie definitely deserves the hype.I also got to watch this movie from the recommendation along with, ""I saw the devil"", ""Man from nowhere"", ""Train to Busan"", etc. I've watched them all, and they were all very good. However, I would particularly give more points on this movie because the way it changes the pace of the movie is really brilliant - I wouldn't go details about it since many people already explained a lot - and that is why even though this movie processes slowly, 2 hour and a half went past really fast. I didn't even know the movie was that long in the first place.I deducted one point because of some ambiguities in the movie. Maybe the director left it open for discussion, but people are taking too many wild guesses because it's difficult to pinpoint the direction in some cases. The good example is the Japanese stranger. Many people seem to get the wrong idea about him. Some even think it's a anti-japan movie which is not, but I wouldn't blame them. If the movie provided more clear or subtle explanation, people wouldn't have gotten the wrong ideas. I was also able to get most of the answers, but boy, it took a lot of time.One thing I'd like to share is that The Shaman's intention was already exposed in his ritual. I wouldn't reveal it too much since this is a spoiler free review. Just Google Jangseung and think back what the Shaman was doing to it in the ritual.",The Wailing

There was a shaman who never really accomplished anything, a priest who seemed to have no purpose in the show at all, a Japanese man who is the target of blatant racism (this is apparently his only purpose), and a woman who seems to be important at the end but we have no idea why she's important or who she is. There is an implication (or direct accusation) that evil is targeting this one man because of his sin, but it hits lots of other people before it touches him. 
The end is a total mess - very tense, they do try to keep you on the edge of your seat, but the issue with the unclear characters bothered me too much to really enjoy the movie.",The Wailing

The tension that builds in this movie is really terrifying and will stick with you for a while. I literally had a nightmare the same night after watching this movie; such was its effect. I think, the emotional struggle of a father and the sheer determination to fight the odds to help his child was captured beautifully. Also, there is a certain intangible weirdness in this movie that makes it really unique, served with some brilliant acting. I recommend everyone to stay away from the spoilers and just watch the movie. It is hell of a ride if you allow yourself submerge into the plot. Another masterpiece from Korean cinema.

The movie takes place in a small village in south Korea, a policeman is investigating a series of murders but then more strange things start to happen, people losing their minds, Houses burning, suicides... and at the center of all this mystery is The Japenese Man ""the stranger"" and the mysterious Woman in White, I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for you but it's really one of the most original and most Clever mystery/horror films ever made in my opinion especially in the midst of all the Hollywood recycled movies, rip offs and remakes that strangely make a sh!t load of money at the box office but films like this, ones that challenge viewers both mentally and emotionally, are completely ignored by movie goers, I'm sure Horror fans will consider this film a miracle and non Horror fans will enjoy it even more because I think it works really well as a Mystery/Thriller, the characters are well developed and you start to care for them especially the Protagonist and his daughter who deliver stunning performances and the cinematography is spot on.

134,myc4971,This will go down as ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FLICKS of all time,10,13 September 2016,"I can't stop thinking about this movie and it's been 24 hours since I've seen it. I find myself replaying the movie in my head over and over. I find myself reflecting on the themes that it tries to bring to the surface. Easily, this goes down as one of the best horror movies I've watched. On the second thought, it's one of the best movies I had the pleasure of watching! It's smart, it's clever and it's beautiful! Words that you won't actually use to describe typical horror movies. What makes ""GOKSUNG"" transcend its genre is that it has so many layers but each one is as potent as the other. Like an onion, some audience will walk away only having seen the outer layer but would feel as satisfied as the next audience who was able to see through all its layers. I was taken aback when I read the message boards and reviews where critics and moviegoers weren't actually too sure if they understood the movie correctly. I've read reviews where they view the film as a social commentary between the divide between Japanese and Koreans, others view the film as a genuinely creepy horror movie, others view it from the tragedy that it is, others saw it as a spiritual exploration. And I was thoroughly surprised by this because I didn't see the ending as an abstract one. To me, it left very little to the interpretation. But to better understand this, I had to search through interviews of the director (Hong Jin Na) on what he wants the viewers to take away with them. It helped a lot how the film came to be. He started writing the script of the movie when a series of deaths started happening to his friends/family members. Though he didn't elaborate, he termed the deaths as ""unnatural"" which leaves me to think they were murdered. Grieved with the loss of his friends, he started asking ""why them?"". It brought him to a journey asking different religions to somehow demystify it. This movie was a result of that exploration. In some ways, the movie tries to answer that. Jong Goo, the ""hero"" of the movie, asked the same question several times but there's really no special reason behind it. The stranger did not choose them, it just so happened his daughter took the bait (now think back to the first frame of the movie where the stranger was seen fishing, putting a bait on the hook brilliant!) We often try to search for a deeper meaning into bad things that happens to us. To devout catholics, it's the guilt that it's punishment for sins we have committed. But in the end, we really don't have anyone but to blame but ourselves. It is within our will not to give in to the temptation/bait but sometimes we just do because we don't see through the events that will be set in motion. We often times act in haste thinking our actions doesn't have consequences. The movie forces us to evaluate who brings unspeakable tragedies into this world. Should we blame the devil for laying down the trap? Or should we blame ourselves for being too blind to see it? I think this point was the one that resonated with me: people in this day and age have become desensitized with evil that we rarely think that the devil is real in a physical sense. There's that unbelief in the supernatural that it has no place in our reality. Just like Jong Goo who had heard of (he charged it to village rumours) and seen the Devil (he thought he was a serial killer, nothing more) before but never really understood what he was up against. Several times, he was also given a warning to stay away from the tragic path he was walking into (through his dreams and the most blatant one, to wait for the third crow of the roosters) but alas, Jong Goo relied on what was logical in our reality. It's more logical and easier to believe that our nightmares can never happen in the real world. It's more logical to rush back home when your family is in danger. It's more logical to believe in a religious figure (priest/shaman) than a woman you suspect is a ghost. And that same unbelief is the very tool that the devil uses against us. ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" --- The Usual SuspectsThis movie is loaded with symbolisms, parallels and commentaries but never once did it hinder the narrative. It even enriched the movie, making three hours seem like two! The director's control over the whole movie is just masterful. To achieve a tonal balance between humour and horror is an achievement by itself but add to that, a movie that works on so many levels this movie is a master filmmaker who understands how to ""talk"" to his audience, what buttons to push to make them think and to make them feel. Hong Jin Na leaves the audience with this: Whatever ideas come to you while you watch the film, they're yours. I want this film to be your own. On the other hand, there is one thing I wish everyone who watches this film to feel, regardless of who they are: a condolence for those who disappeared after having fallen as victims of the world. And for those who are left behind, I sincerely wish this film gives you some time for condolences.",The Wailing
135,fr0w,Not particularly scary.. a lot lost to translation.,6,28 September 2021,"It's easy to say the movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It muddies together Korean folklore and Catholicism with mix results. I'm being kind by giving it the benefit of doubt because I'm not all that knowledgeable on Korean culture. I'm sure there is a story there, I'm just not seeing it.. I mean stuff happens, but characters, despite being well portrayed are inconsistent and often inept. At times funny, but I'm not sure if intentional. It almost has a meaning, about trust, guilt, and sin.. or something. I don't know, but it's probably 45 minutes too long.",The Wailing
136,Vikingbyheart,One of the most significant movies within the genre in recent years!,9,21 October 2016,"Goksung (original title) or The Wailing (English title), the new film from South Korean director and writer Hong-jin Na (known for Chugyeogja - Chaser - 2008 and Hwanghae - The Yellow Sea - 2010), is already considered one of the great works in the horror genre, addressing a macabre part of eastern culture on legends, curses, evil spirits and mysticism, being one of the highlights at the Cannes Film Festival.Coincidentally after the arrival of a stranger, a strange disease begins to spread in the small village of Goksung, triggering a series of brutal murders. What at first appears to be only crimes of passion just takes darker contours, since all deaths occur in mysterious circumstances. In charge of the investigation, the police officer Jong-Goo (played by Do Won Kwak, known for Ajeossi - The Man From Nowhere - 2010) searches for clues and explanations to the tragic events. When his daughter, Hyo-jin (played by Kim Hwan-hee), begins to feel the strange symptoms of the disease, he has to fight against time to solve the mysterious case and save her life.With a rhythmic narrative, The Wailing presents a folk story associated with Eastern mysticism and also the occultism, marked by elements of mystery, horror and supernatural, as guardians, demons and shamans, and the unfolding of the plot gradually gets more intense and disquieting contours. The technical quality is one aspect that stands out in the movie. The picture and the soundtrack provide an immersive and engaging combination as ambiance, expressed by constant rain, the mud, the precariousness of the small village, the striking features of a small town, as well as makeup and massacre scenarios, consolidate the mystical and eerie atmosphere of the film, expanding the mystery and holding the viewer's attention.The script plays well with expectations, building some characters in a dubious way, without specifying their actual intentions. A relatively simple story is presented in a complex and intriguing way, where apparently scenes with no great purpose show us much, requiring attention to small details, whether occult symbols or religious references (Biblical). Crows and goat's head are used throughout the narrative, symbolizing death and evil omen and referring to the profane and witchcraft.The film manages to build an atmosphere of terror without abusing the typical genre tricks. The moments of humor are used to softer the approach of a subject that in itself is already quite tense. Here it is worth mentioning the great performance of Do Won Kwak in the caricatured role of the lazy, fumbling and fearful police officer, though well intentioned.With a competent job of the cast, efficient direction creating an atmosphere that blends mystery, horror and comedy as well as providing much reflection with an end open to different interpretations and also for its originality, The Wailing is one of the most significant movies within the genre in recent years.",The Wailing

138,s0hc4ht04,One hell of a ride,9,1 October 2016,"This movie was a hell of a ride. About 40 minutes into the movie, I stopped to look at how much time was left and was actually RELIEVED to see that there was still so much left. That's how engaging and interesting the story was for me. Before watching the movie I read one review on here that said it was a ""smorgasbord"" of genres (it was a positive review), but it doesn't really feel like it. I mean, yes, I can see it, but the storytelling is so fluid and well written that the multiple genre aspects didn't feel out of place at all. It works. It works so well that I almost feel like it's redundant to point out that there are ""so many genres.""I found the second half of this movie quite similar to The Witch. Not necessarily in terms of the storyline, but the pace, the severity, the terror. Both movies are quite psychological. But The Wailing delivers somewhat of a more complex storyline.Cinematography was breathtaking. Jun Kunimura was ridiculous (in an oh-so-good way). All the actors were on point. I'm not going to point out or mention ""Asian horror"" here (although, technically I just did I guess, lol). I just don't think that it's necessary to pigeonhole this movie into anything other than what it is; a great horror.",The Wailing
139,getting2me,not a bad movie,8,24 March 2020,"Firstly, let me say if you want to see how average everyday South Koreans live, then this movie is for you. I've lived in Korea 2 years and was in and out of the country for the next 3 years. The movie shows actual Korean housing, not the fancy apartments you normally see in a Korean movie. It shows them eating breakfast(meaning they do actually eat kimchee every meal) and even shows the wife doing laundry the Korean way. Not with a washing machine.The movie starts off fairly comical and jovial. I found myself thinking, what the hell am I watching. All I can say, since I was there in the 80's, the Koreans have come a long way in horror type movies. In those days I couldn't even get my girlfriends to go watch American horror films. And the Korean horror movies were equivalent to American horror movies from the 40's. This movie I wouldn't even consider to be horror, more of a suspense thriller. But it was well worth watching nonetheless. I can't say the ending would be my favorite as they throw a few curveballs.

Directed by the Korean director Hong-jin Na of the chaser and yellow sea fame (check them out guys) and overall this film is an improvement on his previous films. The story is about a rise in murders in a small town where people randomly are going crazy and killing their families so it seems. we follow a police officer who has heard rumours of a link between a Japanese man and the recent outbreaks of murders. While this plot seems simplistic enough it becomes more and more obscure. Some people don't like it on this basis but it's exactly my type of film. what you get is shamen, undead, black magic, possession,""ghosts"" and dead crows of course. The film is quite long clocking in just over 2 hours but it is an easy watch while it is a slow burner it is not to slow and build upon the atmosphere and tension of never quite knowing what is happening. It's not for everyone I'd recommend to those of you into black magic and Chinese horror films.",The Wailing
143,birgit_schuette,"Decent, but Could Be Better",7,15 December 2018,"Let me start offy saying I did like this movie, I just think it lost momentum and suspense in parts and that took away from its mystery. It started off great - viewers don't really know what's causing this ailment (is it the Japsnese guy or is that just superstition? Is it that weird fungus the cop finds at the first victim's house?). The dreams of the Japanese guy with red eyes is also cool. Again - you could chalk it up to a smal town's fear of foreigners. But then as it progresses, it turns out it IS the Japanese guy, and the main guy spends loads of money on a shamanic ritual to save his daughter, which appears to be working, until he cuts it off halfway thru cuz his daughters freaking out. Here I started to get a bit bored. The plot shifts to just plain superstition and it's no longer about the mystery of finding out the root of the true evil. Let me also say there's a lot of scenes of the cops being hysterical and screaming. I get you're scared, but you're supposed to be the order in this town.In the apparent crescendo of the film, cops go get the (now injured from the ritual) Japanese guy. He gets away... apparently overhearing the man crying about his daughter (you're led to believe he actually feels remorse here), and then is mundanely killed by either accidentally or on purposely running in front of the cop guys truck. Daughter gets better, hallelujah everything appears saved. Pretty anticlimactic after the very mysterious, supernatural beginning.Luckily, here it gets better again. Turns out Japanese man is NOT the cause, he was helping, and it's the mystery woman you suspected was helping earlier in the film that's the real evil. The real denouement ends up being quite good, in the plot twist at the end. So overall, good film. Just loses a bit of its suspense in the middle. Some minor changes could've kept the tension and mystery up throughout.Still great production and effects and overall high-value film.

Herrings? More like leads down the garden, or rather, mountain path...It is especially frustrating as the movie is long, there's little build-up to the horrors, few techniques that could be effective in moving the story-telling along were used and the terrifying moments become repetitious and drawn-out. Many of these repetitious scenes could have been cut to focus instead on the background to some of the key characters, not only to increase audience understanding of the families, the cultural context, religious beliefs and superstitions but to help to make the final conclusions comprehensible in flashback....that ""oh I missed that bit about character X, it explains why things turn out this way, etc."" moment.Acting was really good, which is the high point of the movie for me.That's what the 5 is for.Shame the talent wasn't put to more effective use, as the story has great potential.",The Wailing

That's close to what Hong-jin Na has done with his half-parody, half-serious take on his supernatural material. He's more serious than not, but he's also fatally hung his tale on a cop protagonist who's a pudgy bumbling wimp. We're meant to see multiplying local horrors as the forge that helps officer Jong-goo man up, if not in the eyes of his bored wife then at least to save his cutie pie kid. He's determined to scream and run for it like a Korean Lou Costello.This prefab spook house is filled with slapstick, zombies, ghosts, plagues, exorcisms and gore, but Na's predictable and it's always obvious where he's going next. He has an OK eye, a plodder's pacing and a manga's paint-by-number characters. His action sequences typically involve the same repeated pratfalls -- he's no Yeon Sang-ho!

There is a lotof WAILING in the movie for sure, but instead of it being satisfying,you're left with a keen sense of annoyance. I guess the lead should be praised for portraying such an oafish buffoon, but in light of the story (zombies and demonic possession), it tends to grate to the point of masochism.The movie takes itself very seriously, which may cause one to exalt it as something higher than what it is. Ultimately it's a fairly simple demonic possession and zombie movie. There's a subtext that hints to a poor relationship between paganism and monotheism, but it's not explored to any satisfaction.I do like the cinematography - apart from the 'rain on cue', the lush scenery of rural Korea is presented well.",The Wailing

152,giallopudding,All that wailing without a payoff,4,25 November 2019,"To call The Wailing tonally inconsistent is an understatement. This film is a big fail on two levels: first it needs some serious chopping in the editing room. At least 30 minutes of tedious shamanistic drum beating and moronic cop antics could have been left on the cutting room floor, and the movie would have been better because of it.
Second, the plot makes no sense either way you look at it. We are given two potential culprits behind the mayhem in the village resulting in zombie-like symptoms in the ""infected"" citizens. Two possible antagonists, and by the end, we still are left with two possibilities. But neither one makes much sense, in the context of the film's narrative.
If mood was everything in assessing a horror film's quality, The Wailing receives a B+ in that category - when the scenes don't include the Keystone Cops crying like little girls, or long closeups of people paralyzed with fear, staring in horror at bloody carnage.
But making viewers endure 2 1/2 hours of suspenseful buildup without providing a sufficient climactic payoff is unforgivable. No amount of style can make up for the egregious lack of substance in this film.

156,mrrcott,Ghostly horror with strong performances,8,13 October 2016,"Goksung (2016) Directed by Hong Jin-Na.I would be very surprised if this isn't the best South Korean movie this year. Director Jin Na takes the audience on an electrifying journey involving ghosts, spirits and the nature of evil itself. Like all great horror films, this one shows how fear builds up from ignorant rumors and gossip as the villagers of this backwater town start to lose their grip on reality.When incompetent police officer Jon-Goo is hired to investigate the multiple murders of man and a woman, he finds the killer covered in blood and shaking at the scene, as though in some kind of trance. He investigates further in his half-hearted way but becomes more and more absorbed. Trying to find a motive for such a senseless crime, he questions the locals. First, someone suggests that the murderer took mushrooms that cause hallucinations. When that idea is pushed aside, someone mentions how ever since a mysterious Japanese fishermen arrived some seriously strange things have been happening in the forest. Such as naked middle –aged men in nappies killing and eating deer in the forest. Then, there is a woman in white who starts appearing outside the police station late at night.It's only when his daughter starts speaking foul language and refuses to listen to him that he realizes he must do everything he can to rid the village of the evil. The corruption of innocence is a horror film tradition dating back to The Exorcist (1972). Director Hong Jin-Na could have watched that film in preparation. Then again, he mostly avoids sudden shocks and prefers to maintain an atmosphere of mounting dread. Originally titled Goksung, which has the dual meaning both of the place, and the sound to wail (which is where the English title comes from). By the time Hwang Jun-Min appears as Shaman to exorcise the presence from the village, we have been led into such a frenzy that we feel we may never recover.After some fairly lacklustre recent films which never delivered their potential (Tunnel, Train to Busan), this film really goes the distance. Fans of Korean films will notice the key stylistic features of Korean films, from cheap barbecue joints where depressed characters down their sorrows in soju; to families all sharing a one-floor apartment and sleeping on the floor. Also present in Korean films are prolonged scenes of characters pouring out their grief by hospital bedsides. There's a great one here where the wife of a man struck by lightning in the forest remarks that hewould have died if he had taken so many tonics. The landscape is in many ways as important as the human characters, and the frequent pull-outs to the misty mountains suggest that such ghosts and spirits have been around since the beginning of time.

158,rumour-mill,An interesting horror with squandered potential,6,7 August 2017,"I watched The Wailing on the back of strong critical response, a rarity for horror films. Unfortunately I was left a little conflicted.The film's premise is a mix of tropes (possession, good vs. evil, religious mythology), and its slow-burn narrative is set in a relatively poor, rural village in South Korea.The tone the movie strikes at first is one of slapstick and black-comedy. The local police are incompetent, unfit and seemingly terrified of everything. I laughed quite a few times throughout. We get little character development; these aren't complicated people. The lead protagonist, Jong-goo, has about as much depth as a petri dish, and - work-shy and cowardly - doesn't inspire much sympathy. Then there's a jarring tonal shift towards seriousness. Seeing Jong-goo distraught over the mystery sickness his daughter is plagued by didn't move me at all, because the goings-on up until that point had been dealt with so flippantly and the characters were painted as comic foils contrasting with the horrific murders. Why would we care about what's happening to these people, when they've been painted as two- dimensional and foolish?The film's final half-an-hour redeemed it somewhat. I'd predicted the twist that the Japanese man was wrongly vilified and was trying to save the village, so when the shaman confirmed it, I was disappointed by how obvious it had been. But then it turned out to be a bluff! Which took me by surprise. He's evil after all. The ending was particularly strong; tragic, but poignant, with some allegorical revelations.The characters make some strange decisions throughout. Why, when Jong-goo discovered the Japanese man had a shrine with photographs of the recent village murders, did he, his colleague and the deacon simply run off? Bring the man in for questioning at least. Get his DNA. Do some actual police work. And why, if the Japanese man was a malevolent being, did he not offer some excuse to put Jong-goo et al off the scent? He made no effort to mislead them (beyond using the shaman), even when there was every opportunity to lie or distract Jong-goo each occasion they confronted him on the top of the mountain. The benevolent ghost Moo-myeong could've made everything clear early on if she'd been less ambiguous - instead she drip-fed pieces of information to Jong-goo, all too late. If she actually wanted to save the village, she could've easily done it. When characters act in improbable or irrational ways in order to confuse the audience so the revelation is a surprise, that's lazy writing in my opinion. To me, this seems like this was just to force ambiguity so we weren't sure who was trustworthy or not, who was 'real' or not.So it's a mixed bag of a movie. The positives are the setting, the basic plot and the pacing. The negatives are the tonal shifts, the shallow characters, some of the writing. There's a gem hidden in there somewhere, I just think it could've shone brighter if handled differently.",The Wailing

As this malevolence begins to manifest itself in his daughter, his unfailing devotion to her allays his fears and drives him to become singularly possessed with confronting this evil. At this point, any humor has vanished from this film.This film, like the antagonistic entity it features, is remarkably deceptive and will keep you guessing right up to the last minute.

The are numerous biblical references (let the one without sin cast the first stone, three calls from the rooster denying Jesus Christ, and probably many more). The two shamans are revealed to be demons causing the sickness in the village.As far as I know, the Korean peninsular is still home to Shamanic religions, even with Christian groups actively trying to rid the country of these religious practices (citation needed, please research to verify). To an outside observer, Shamanism is a religion deserving the same protection of freedom of belief as Christianity benefits from.I do not think this film simply tries to make the viewer think about religion, but actively tries to promote one religion over another.

178,Magnotta43,The Death Stranding of Korean horror,5,28 December 2019,"I don't understand the remarkable amount of praise being heaped on this movie.One of the problems that I have found with Korean movies in general, and specifically Korean horror over the last decade or so, is the prevalence of slapsticky characters. I'm not even sure if this is deliberate on the part of the filmmakers, or if it is just part of how the general Korean acting style has evolved over decades.
The protagonist is this chubby cop who is constantly falling down and shooting goofy looks directly at the camera. He also cries in every other scene, and by the end of the movie, I was thoroughly annoyed and couldn't care less about what he was going through. And he goes through some REALLY bad s-t at the end.This is subjective though, as some people won't have a problem with this. Some people won't care about crying and falling over.
But I think MOST people WILL care about the fact that this movie is almost 2 1/2 hours, and almost 90 minutes of this runtime is a red herring.Without spoiling anything, there is also a very familiar horror trope that pops up in the second half of the movie; one that I'm pretty sure no one is impressed by, much less scared by.The movie does look really nice, the cinematography and scenery are beautiful, and it has generally good performances, the one caveat being the lead actor.",The Wailing

181,azey13,"Ambitious, but scattered in terms of focus.",1,30 December 2016,"The Wailing was an excellent effort and I badly wanted to enjoy it given the way critics have been raving. Instead, it left me frustrated and praying for the end credits repeatedly.I sort of liked the ending and the atmosphere of the film was fantastic, but overall it fell short of being truly enjoyable. I saw it twice in order to understand what spoiled the experience for me, and upon contemplation I think it was because the film, overall, lacked focus. I don't think we needed to sit through two and a half hours of it in order to reach the conclusion that it did, particularly since there are still a number of things in the film which do not add up by the time it ends. I feel like the editing -- in terms of tightening the storyline -- could have been much better. Atmosphere is an important aspect of any horror film, but you don't need two and a half hours to build it and the flow of the story should never be compromised. Moreover, great atmosphere is pointless if you don't actually do anything with it, and this film didn't -- at least not until the last fifteen minutes or so.Another thing that made it difficult to sit through once (and nearly unbearable to sit through a second time) was the lack of a ""good"" character whom I truly liked. I know that it's a thing to be annoyed with some characters in a horror movie (""Too Stupid To Live"" is a trope for a reason), but this is the first film where I actively cheered for the evil side to win before the end. I don't want to give anything away, because I do think that this is a film that should be seen (especially since my opinion of it appears to be an outlier), but do prepare yourself to be completely aggravated by the characters' behavior in this film. If that was what the director was going for, then well done.",The Wailing

It's also expertly crafted with beautiful cinematography and a haunting soundtrack.

There are a few issues however. The first issue is the blatant racism. The ""Jap"" who lives near the village is insinuated as the cause of the horrific scenes unfolding before the villagers; No particular reason why this is so; it's just that he's a Japanese man- (who apparently turns out to be the devil... I think), and that's good enough reason thank you very much! Next, after what felt like 2 hours already, we are led to believe it wasn't the ""Jap"", but some girl... for some reason. But then after another 50 minutes it wasn't her, but the ""Jap"" anyway.. for no particular reason. By this point he turns into the devil... I assume he was- my brain was numb by this point, so I was eyeing the exit sign mostly. Basically it is way, way, way too long. Lastly, why do the characters treat each over so poorly? Almost every line in this is an aggressive bark. It's basically like ""pass me the salt and pepper as***le! the whole way through. But's it's not just the men, it's the grannies, wives and children all getting in on the action in an unrelenting barrage of sh**ty attitudes. It's very unpleasant to watch for 2 and a half hours. Like I mentioned, the young actor was very, very impressive as the exorcist style demonic possessed little girl- but with everyone around her acting like complete pricks the whole movie, it's not as effective as the original.

187,Lord-Bigglesworth,Say what now?,6,21 March 2017,"To me a great film is one that makes the viewer ask questions that relate not only to the film but ones that can give greater insight into the real world. During this film however I found myself asking questions like ""is this part SUPPOSED to be funny?"" and ""what in the hell is going on?"" For the first half of this overly long film I was actually praising how well the humor was translating for a foreign language film; during the second half all that praise went away. The film seemed to have taken a turn for the serious but there were several scenes where certain elements were so over-the- top ridiculous that they seemed unintentionally comical. The second aspect of this could just be a matter of viewer preference. The audience struggles with figuring out just who is to blame for the evil plaguing the characters in the film until the last few minutes. This, in itself, isn't so much the problem as is the questioning that arises concerning certain scenes from earlier in the film. One of the unintentionally funny (and seriously overly-drawn-out) scenes from earlier in the film seems to have little-to-no purpose once the true villain is revealed. All-in-all it was successfully disturbing horror film but one that seemed to be plagued with the notions that ""more is more"" and, at times, a difficultly in establishing the right tone.

194,kjihwan,An accomplished occult thriller too open-ended for its own good,7,17 September 2016,"Director Na, Hong-jin catapulted himself into the Korean directing elite with his much lauded debut movie, The Chaser, back in 2008. His follow-up, The Yellow Sea, received more tepid response, but there was little doubt that here was a movie-maker who had the potential to be spoken of in the same sentence as Bong Joon-ho and Park Chan-wook. His latest, The Wailing, starts with more than a passing resemblance to Bong's masterpiece, Memories of Murder. There's a series of grisly, unexplained murders in a backward-looking (although in The Wailing's case contemporary) countryside, which is then investigated by ordinary cops – more put-upon locals in uniform than law enforcers – increasingly out of their depth. What appears first as simple murders of passion begins to spread across the village, while an increasing number of people fall victim to a violent – and violence-inducing – fever, including the young daughter of one of the policemen on the case, Jong- gu. A portly every-man and a doting father, he is bewildered by the severity of the crimes (especially so in a hitherto tranquil countryside) and heart-broken by his daughter's sudden affliction. Desperate to find a cure, Jong-gu (played by Kwak, Do-won, a Na alumnus from Yellow Sea) and his friends latch onto the fact that the fever seemingly started after an unknown Japanese man appeared in the area. The more they delve into the stranger (Jun Kunimura, best known for getting decapitated by Lucy Liu in Kill Bill), the more Jong-gu realizes that the situation may belong more in the realms of the unnatural. Enlisting the help of a charismatic shaman, Jong-gu goes to the extremes to find a solution. Fittingly for the fishing motif that's so prevalent in the film, however, the more he bites at the problem, the more he seems to be ensnared.It's been a while since a Korean film had this kind of craftsmanship and artistic control to match its ambition. In many ways The Wailing is the true successor to the class of 2003 – when A Tale of Two Sisters and Oldboy as well as the aforementioned Memories of Murder were released – with how confidently the visuals are displayed, the themes are interwoven, and the story unfolds. The forebodingly beautiful cinematography nods at Kubrick, the acting is exemplary (including a worryingly remarkable turn from the child actress Kim, Hwan-hee as Jong-gu's daughter), and most of all the atmosphere of escalating horror that Na captures is impressively unsavoury indeed. The film is a bold departure (or throwback, depending on how you look at it) for Korean cinema in its heavy emphasis on the occult, a theme more associated in the country with the well-worn moralism of its ghost stories and the oft-parodied rituals of harlequin-esque shamans. At well over two and a half hours, The Wailing is a hefty movie, but with its potent mixture of procedural mystery, black comedy and a prevailing sense of dread, it commands attention masterfully for much of the duration.The one drawback for the film is a significant one that takes the shine off what could otherwise have been a landmark movie. During the course of the film Na throws a number of questions and macguffins up in the air. Who or what is causing the fever? Can the shaman be trusted? Is the Japanese stranger a victim of xenophobia? Who is the nameless girl always hovering around the crime scenes? Or is it all just collective hallucination caused by bad mushrooms? The Wailing takes its twists and turns, apparently answering the questions and overturning expectations. But then it keeps going, reopening closed plot strands and even downright contradicting itself on occasions. It soon becomes apparent that Na isn't so much interested in telling a self-contained story than an exercise in audience-baiting. All of the elements in the film which were so compelling and enjoyable are not allowed to coalesce together in the end, and the actions and motives of the major characters – the Japanese man, Jong-gu and his daughter, the shaman, the nameless girl – are ultimately rendered disparate, abstract and illogical. The ending is neither closed nor open-ended, but rather wilfully indeterminate, and it's tempting to think that Na is applying the film's fishing motif to the audience.

197,shea765,The Groaning,3,20 June 2017,"10-word review: Vastly overappreciated pseudo-horror film with little continuity or technical accomplishment.Long review: The only wailing you'll remember after watching this film is your own cry of irritation having just spent 2 hours and 36 mins following a trek-to-nowhere that could have been edited down to a mere short.It's a common exaggeration to say that a movie has no plot, but in this case it's hard to argue. (Spoiler alert) A small South Korean hamlet is invaded by demons (who double as Minolta film camera enthusiasts -- where do they develop their rolls?) undertaking a wanton campaign to slaughter the villagers one by one. Who are these photographic fiends? Why do they ""shoot to kill""? By what supernatural means do they convert the innocent into bloodthirsty monsters? Such basic questions never disturb the imagination of our filmmaker.Instead, the bulk of the movie concerns the villagers' unreasonable reactions to their increasingly troubling plight: e.g. (1) The police find a wall of photos of the mounting victims in the home of the suspected murderer/demon, yet do nothing when the suspect walks in. (2) Zombies attack the innocent only for their friends to defend the zombies instead. (3) Doctors conclude that mushrooms consumed locally for many years are suddenly at fault for patients molting their skin, losing all higher brain function, and biting anything that moves. Alrighty then.After hours of confusion, the question boils down to whether the devil is an aged Japanese man who lives in the nearby forest. Why this should be the denouement of such an overlong odyssey is anyone's guess, but it's a clear reference to the generalized sentiment that Japanese = devils, probably the most overused and least surprising conceit in all of Korean cinematic history. Best to stick with the tried and true, I guess.Technically, the film is a slop-fest with minimal evidence of editing. I would definitely have resorted to fast-forwarding had I been watching it alone; many scenes were the cinematic equivalent of enduring a simpleton windbag use tortuous explanations for the most insignificant conclusions. In one humorous example of the filmmakers' inattention, the protagonist struggles with a decision to accept or decline a phone call, eventually deciding to decline the call BY PRESSING THE GREEN BUTTON. This sort of inadvertent surrealism sums up the movie for me.So why the decent reviews on this site? That's hard to answer. It seems that a certain number of reviewers are just big Korean film fans, and maybe this attachment impedes their judgment. That said, I'm a Korean film fan myself. If you're interested in an infinitely better Korean horror/crime movie, I'd recommend ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong Joon Ho's tour de force dramatization of the Hwaseong serial murders. Now that's a scary film you won't want to forget.",The Wailing
198,wcoleparks,Beware The Wailing! This film will stick with you,8,21 June 2016,"The Wailing opens with a quote from the bible. It is easy to forget this fact while watching most of the film, but at a certain point it becomes clear the purpose that quote served. It is almost like a warning: ""if you are a religious person, this film will scare every part of you."" This is where The Wailing works so well. As a religious parable, it overcomes its lengthy running time and tonal imbalance, to deliver an often funny but truly terrifying film.When a mysterious stranger moves to a small village in South Korea, the village becomes plagued by sickness. The police think a wild mushroom is to blame, but police officer Jong-goo thinks it may have something to do with the stranger. He meets a woman who gives him some information about this mysterious man, and slowly begins to fall down a rabbit hole that consumes his life. When his daughter starts to show signs of the sickness, it gets personal and he must figure out who to trust and who to avoid.The director, Hong-jin Na, struggles to find a good tonal balance. At times pitch perfect and at other times all over the place, the tone struggles to stay consistent. For the first third of the film, it is primarily a funny movie with briefs bursts of depravity and violence. The comedy works well and I found myself laughing a number of times. Then when the horrific imagery would come up it was sudden and effective. There was a good balance here that gets lost in the second act. The comedy becomes more slapstick and does not fit with the rest of the film. The characters also become over-the-top and act in exaggerated ways very different from how they were introduced. This middle section also has some moments of unintentional humor. One example sees a man struck by lightening and another has the caller ID for a shaman come up on the phone as ""Shaman"".Fortunately it finds a good balance again in the third act, but smartly switches it up from the first act. It becomes intense and terrifying with a few moments of comedy to offset the horror. And what a terrifying last act it is. As everything starts to unfold, the audience gains a new appreciation of the rest of the film and starts to reinterpret certain scenes. The only problem is that a few of these scenes only made sense once the film ended. Rather than feeling natural and fitting in as the story progressed, they required the ending to actually make sense.At 2 hours and 36 minutes, the film is just too long. The middle portion of the film is where this could have been resolved. The shaman had too much screen time performing various rituals that ended up not being very important. There was also a 'zombie' scene that felt awkward and didn't fit in with the rest of the movie. It seemed as though they wanted to put a zombie in the film just because of their growing popularity. This scene also brings in a number of random characters that serve no purpose in the rest of the film.Despite a few scenes with the previously mentioned overacting, the acting generally speaking is fantastic. The father tasked with solving whatever is happening to his daughter, conveys the terror and hatred he is building up with an intense persona he carries throughout the film. A priest in training who comes in to give advice on what the father should do is equally effective. He brings a concerned and innocent quality to the terror that will ultimately happen. But it is the young daughter who gets sick, that really shines. Channeling her inner Linda Blair, she emphatically delivers horrible, dirty lines that no child should ever say. Her performance is truly terrifying as you watch the hatred in her eyes slowly take over.As the film comes to an end, the religious overtones become clearer. Locusts attack an individual. White and black are used to suggest character's true nature. And it is in these scenes where the film truly shines. By slowly unveiling the real nature of certain characters, the last 45 minutes of the movie will change your perspective on the whole thing. Every few minutes you will switch sides when trying to determine whom to trust and only when the big reveal comes do you realize how detailed the setup to get there was. The reveal really puts a twist on everything that led up to it and the film ultimately becomes about the horrors of putting your faith in the wrong people.The Wailing (2016) Directed by: Hong-jin Na Screenplay by: Hong-jin Na Starring: Woo-hee, Jeong-min Hwang, So-yeon Jang, and Do Won Kwak Run Time: 2 hours 36 minutes",The Wailing
199,SilentEyes_,Another horror masterpiece from South Korea,9,15 September 2016,"I want to start this review with saying that I am not completely against jump scares. They play integral part of horror movies, but when a movie mostly relies on them and is not supported with great story, I am always left displeased. What makes The Wailing so special is that there are almost no jump scares at all in this film. Instead, we, the viewers, are taken through a story rich with mystery, great characters and their struggles, dark atmosphere with well designed and amazingly crafted horror scenes that make your blood run cold. Also, in addition the movie carries a great subtext left for the viewer to question, find evidence and interpret it. You can feel that the director took some time and did some research to give us as much real horror experience as possible. One might find The Wailing a bit boring because the film is a slow burner and not constructed as most of modern horror films, or might find the film too long (running time 2h 36min) but if you are patient man it will pay off by the end.Who says that the horror genre is dead.

202,abdelrahmanmasry,Not a masterpiece,6,13 October 2021,"As far as horror movies go, The Wailing doesn't offers many new ideas to the genre, in fact it relies on the oldest and most common cliche in horror movies, the possessed child, albeit with slower pacing and more story than jumpscares. The small village is an adequate location for this type of horror, which is mainly centered around superstition and fear of 'the stranger'.The main protagonist is an everyday dad, who's also a police officer, and he's no better being one or the other. He's also the comic relief in this film, in fact, the way he conducts himself and his tone of voice reminded me quite a lot of Homer Simpson, but Korean.Interesting watch if you'd like something different and don't mind subtitles, if you're trying to decide between this and The Omen, you can confidently pick The Wailing.",The Wailing

212,evemas-am,"Horror on the Surface, Satire Underneath",10,16 March 2018,"The Wailing may look like a generic and light-hearted horror movie on the surface. However, by delving deeper into the story's plot, evidences of satire that is related to the second World War and the Japanese invasion of Korea can be seen clearly. At the center of the satire, is the Japanese man who represents the war era Japan that had invaded Korea, resulting in the death of many men, women, and children and the emergence of ""comfort Women"" which was in reality the prostitution of young women and even girls. For instance, the young woman in white may represent the Comfort Women. There is even a a scene in which the Japanese man chases the woman in the jungle. And in another scene, he attacks another woman in an attempt to rape her. There are also other traces of rape and sexual abuse in women. For example, most women seem to have contracted a disease that is somewhat similar to that of an STD that has also transferred into men. And the policeman's daughter's thighs are bruised. Later, she also confesses that she has met the Japanese man. Moreover,the Japanese man's cleansing practice in the waterfall may represent Japan's attempt to cleanse its past, but to no avail. The whole village and maybe even the policeman stands for Korea, and the people are the nation. Nobody trusts the Japanese man, nobody likes him, but no matter how hard they try, they fail to drive him out of the village; he is there to stay and to make sure that everyone is consumed. One by one, the families fall victim to the Japanese man (or the Devil) who fall upon them like a disease. The disease then spreads until it consumes the whole village. Finally, the Shaman is a representation of traitors that allowed Japan to take over the country for their own personal profit. All in all, the movie has skillfully illustrated the horrors of the war, and the feeling of helplessness and darkness that takes over a country during such a period.",The Wailing

Being very well versed in South Korean movies I was prepared for a lot of the things critics seem to take umbridge with (i.e. the constant swearing/insulting, almost comic violence, and blatant racism) but even I was left stumped at some parts, especially the end. Semi spoiler alert: much of this movie revolves around the shamanic traditions and practices of rural South Korea. Being familiar with this will help immensely in understanding the plot and possibly the ending. While I was left utterly confused, my husband had followed a plot thread I had not been able to pick up on and was left with a conclusion about the ending I could never have come to on my own. So those critics in a huff over how disappointing the ending was, I think the intended audience (South Korean viewers) probably did not experience this which explains its commercial success. That being said, this is not a movie I would watch again, and I would only recommend it to people who enjoy really artsy, drawn out, ""decide for yourself"" sorts of horror movies (all those people who liked ""The Witch"").",The Wailing
222,myscreenwriter,A mystery puzzle,10,29 July 2017,"Impressive mystical build-up. Not only are the characters, the scenery, the acting founded in a story, where people are real. Writer & director Hong-jin Na, gives a powerful view of the dangers surrounding a world of shamans, evil spells, leaving viewers and protagonist Jong-goo (the policeman) in a maze of ignorance, toward a parallel world, only understood or presumably understood by people with special insights.There is an ongoing debate about the conclusion or understanding of the movie, none of them right or wrong, and that is exactly the point, the film offers a view in a world of mysticism, where events can be reversed or take an unexpected turn. The understanding comes with, how you choose to put these events together, giving them purpose. Here is the way I have chosen to put events together, giving some sort of understanding of this chilling drama. (reading on will spoil the fun,if you haven't seen the movie yet) Moving to the middle of the movie, the shaman Il-gwang wants to cast a deadly hex, (death spell) towards the presumed evil shaman, the Jap. Il-gwang states clearly to Jong-goo, that this evil shaman is a master of evil, and that drinking, having intercourse or anything resembling vulnerable behavior, may disrupt the casted hex and make it backfire. In my opinion, that is exactly the key, making events and spells spiral out of control. The father and policeman Jong-goo, can't watch while his daughter screams in agony, while Il-gwang is performing the hex. Going against the shaman's clear instructions, Jong-goo stops Il-gwang in the middle of casting the hex, and the deadly spell backfires. Not only does the Jap survive the attack, but Il-gwang turns evil, thus the result of the reversing hex. Another side effect on reversing the hex, is that instead of killing, the hex is then sent toward the dead corpse in the car reviving it, setting him of as a bodyguard for the Jap (evil strategic thinking) while he is recovering. Once turning the good shaman Il-gwang to the evil side, the Jap secludes himself from sight, by staging his own death, Jong-goo thinking he has killed the Jap in a truck accident. Il-gwang faces the mysterious woman, who now protects Jong-goo's family, and starts bleeding out the nose and vomiting fiercely, he flees under attack until he reaches the boarders of her powers (when the bug hallucinations stop). Back at the house Jong-goo faces the mysterious woman, who tells him not to go back to the house until the rooster has crowed three times. Il-gwang (now in the devil's league) tells Jong-goo not to trust her over the cellphone. The father and policeman losing faith, (impossible for Jong-goo and us for that matter, to see what is what at this stage) returns to his house before the roosters third crow and finds his wife and mother in law dead. Thus, the protecting spell of the mysterious woman is broken (her use and powers now indifferent) giving Il-gwang the opportunity to return and take the pictures of Jong-goo's slain family.Ultimately the movie offers a puzzle, whether you want to solve it your own way or demanding it be solved for you, before you leave the theater, is a matter of temper. For me personally it was a thrill to be challenged by writer & director Hong-jin Na, giving me a lot to think about (thus giving the movie 10). The best part of this puzzle is that it can be solved in many ways, this was just one of many.M.R.",The Wailing

I wasn't tracking my movies and rating them back then so I decided to revisit it today.I've decided this is one of my favorite horror movies. I love Korean and Japanese horror, so maybe I'm biased. But this is exactly the type of film I look for. Dark, mysterious, maybe a little supernatural, and no jump scares. It's not the type of film to be always on the move trying to get you to jump out of your seat. It unnerves you, makes you think, makes you feel for the characters. There's even some well placed humor here and there, making the characters seem more realistic, not everyone is so glum and serious in real life.There's also of course a lot of gore, but it's not just a zombie flick if that's what you're expecting. Be prepared for lots of twists and turns, this movie is a lot deeper than it appears on the surface.",The Wailing
225,aristos84,Horror-Drama from South Korea,8,25 March 2019,"The Wailing is a horror/drama movie which keep you alert till the final second. In the beginning of this movie a formidable demonic power devastates the unsuspicious residents of a village and it threatens soon to strike in the home of the family of protagonists.
The demon consumes the souls of the villagers and literary reap one after another like a harvester the ripe wheat. Any defenses seem to be hopeless and the police can't do nothing but updating its record. Here the director's satirical disposition creates such an amusing picture of the police department that in the middle of all this burst of violence, it functions as a calming respite. As it seems it consists a common motif in Korean cinema, because we have seen it before in Memories of Murder of Joon-ho Bong. It's an approach that purposefully misdirect us from the looming threat and also implys that the form of evil we are facing will not be defeated by pure force.
The narration of the movie follows the slow pace with which the main character and police investigator tries to solve the mystery of violent deaths. There is a main suspect (the Japanese man) who the policemen are late to interrogate although the locals point toward him. And when they investigate his lodge and find strong evidences against him they fail to proceed the case further, giving him the time to hide anything that would incriminate him. It's a novice approach on their part but it doesn't damage the movie because it passes to us a malicious and evil picture of the Japanese stranger.When the demonic force inflicts the protagonist's daughter our hero has to give a personal fight to earn her back not as an officer but as a father. And when the family decides to bring a shaman to exorcise the demon, he appears as a silver lining in the cloud. The rituals that take place later are not only interesting as a cinematographic image but serve also as dramaturgic process with tense and high emotions.
The second ritual provokes a counter-ritual by the Japanese man/demon and the director films it as a critical confrontation full chants and meaningful body language. It's a stage of a spiritual battle with theatrical interplay and climactic suspense. Both the shaman and the Japanese excel as spiritual, out of this world actors, who in a few minutes of ritualistic practice open to us a window to the ancient world beyond. The sequence is amongst the highlights of the movie.
But just when we thought we had figured out who is the good and bad in this movie the scenario gets perplexed with the presence of a young woman. She seems to be able to exert power over the two shamans and suddenly our understanding for the movie is shaking. If she is the demon, then we were looking at the wrong spot the hole movie. But what if she's not and her intentions are to help the little girl?
Uncertainty reigns as we don't know if we are misguided or illuminated by the words of the actors. A crack towards the truth opens in the last sequences of the movie but for me it is just too stretched. One twist in the myth was enough to thrill me, a second one that subverts the first is pushed a bit far. However we talk about an overall exciting movie.",The Wailing
226,hem-97776,Christian propaganda at its finest.,1,14 July 2020,"The movie is artistic and i would have had no problem with the film except for the party where they made the bad shaman a buddist to show that other gods and their followers are the helpers of the devil.
The artsy part is that they used a horror film to justify bad things happening to people because of not having faith or rejecting god's help(typical christian lore). The bad and the ugly part is to go an extra mile and talk about other religions in a bad way. The shaman is shown to be a helper of the devil. The film intentionally establishes that he is a Buddha worshipper before revealing that he is a helper of the devil. He can be seen with his Buddha idol once in his place and again while he packs his stuff and tries to flee in his car. The second time is when it becomes evident. In the car, the Buddha statue is placed in a way that it is seen while driving, reminding the audience that he is Buddhist. Then later it is revealed that he helped the devil in misleading regular folks away from god's help by deceiving them and towards sin.
The Bible talks about other religions and their goods in a similar fashion. Bible says other spirits/gods that don't acknowledge Jesus/god is anti-christ or helpers of the devil.
It is one thing to throw in Bible references and using a little scare while promoting ones own religion but it is a new low for mainstream movie makers to throw mud on other's religions.

Is it supposed to be a comedy or is all the goofy antics of the main character(s) unintentional? It's like the movie is trying to be serious/heavy but the hero is straight out of Dumb and Dumber. Can someone explain these questions?-Why are these police officers so inept? I've seen volunteer neighborhood watch citizens with more bearing. They're just a bunch of bumbling fools. Like the scene where they investigate the burned up house. All of the police officers just stand around while a woman attacks another officer??? -These are supposed to be police! Why are they hiding under their desk when that woman appears in the doorway to their station??? They act like 10 year olds scared at a boogeyman, not grown adults supposed to enforce the laws. -I'm at the scene where they investigate the house and one of the officers found a room full of evidence. So what happens when the owner comes back? They hang their heads in shame like kids caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Who cares if you broke in, you just basically solved the whole mystery right there. The next scene you see a police car driving down a road and thinking ""It's about time they pulled their heads out of their asses and called for backup."" Nope, of course not. Instead we have a bunch more bumbling idiot Dumb and Dumber detectives. ""What you're saying doesn't make sense?"" Then pull the police car over and figure out what's going on with your partner??? He's obvious in distress, why are we taking this so lightly? Why does every adult male act like a castrated wimp? These are police but act like a bunch of scared children. They obviously can't handle a serious police investigation so why are they placed in charge? What am I missing here? Like I said, I'm about an hour in and this is the furthest I've been able to watch before wanting to rip my hair out. It's like this movie can't figure out what it wants to be.The movie tagline should be: A slapstick comedy about two bumbling and stammering police officers trying to solve a horrific serial killer case. Even a Woody Allen type character has more bearing than these buffoons.",The Wailing

It hooks you with this and with the mystery that surrounds the events, but the film unfolds at a snail's pace, so from the middle of the film the impression of a boring film remains.The conclusion is disappointing too.

Without exaggeration, 50% of the scenes in this movie could be removed from it, and it would only serve to improve the movie.The effects and acting were fine, although the main character was totally unrelatable and over-the-top idiotic.

I have no idea why this movie has gotten such great reviews. it's really not that good.SPOILERS.In the end when our main character confronts the lady in white. He noticed pieces throughout the movie. The clothes of two of the victims. And the lady just says 'that's not it'. Well then what is it!?!?!
WHY. What would have happened if he waited for the 3rd rooster crow? Would the daughter have still murdered the mother and grandmother but have walked thru the gate and been healed? There's just no explanation at the end.
The entire ending with the Japanese man was just absolutely awful and I hated it.The main actor was great and it was shot really well, but that's not even close to making this watchable. hard pass for me.

241,timhudd-1,Missed Call from Shaman,3,30 July 2017,"I had mirrored the bored impassive face of the main character Jong-goo within five minutes of this film starting and thus remained for the next two and half hours. There lies the first issue. Jong-goo is set up as a bumbling, oafish, bored gluttonous cop for the first half hour and in this he carries some comedic merit, we warm to him slightly as a family man just muddling through. When the unscary scariness ensues however, I found I was only left with the two moulds of reaction he'd left me - comedy or impassivity. There was nothing new in this film. We saw tired bloody chinned zombies going for the throat whilst shouting. This was farcically amusing for two seconds then boring then annoying. We saw an Asian child who shouted and cried a lot. Children have been used as scary tropes a million times and this director seemed to be dimly aware of that notion so just put one in hoping it was then scary. It was not. The irritating infant should have just been put in a box to contain it but somehow managed to run the show and kill about three people.Modernity and myth are not comfortable bed fellows and this was exemplified in jarring fashion by a mobile savvy Shaman in this film. We should at least have been jarred by some images of the supernatural but unless you count some pathetic Jim Hensonesque work at the end, this was absent.Criminally overlong and unscary meant my pulse actually slowed as the film progressed.

In fact, the movie starts with verses in Luke and ends with the resurrected demon showing his palm with a nail mark, asking the priest to touch and feel him to believe the devil's true form.Wailing (or Goksung) has a double meaning. Goksung is the name of a small town in Southwestern where the director grew up. It also means wailing (In Korean, it has a more nuanced meaning - it is haunting wailing of people when someone dies). Director Na took 6 years to make this film. He even lived with a shaman for two months to accurately reflect their ritual and visuality. It is a complex movie that eludes understanding of many audience both in Korea and outside of it because the director - a protestant - blends a Christian message deeply wrapped in the Korean folk tradition (his previous movie, ""Chaser"" use Christian background contrasted against a serial killer).It is a movie that make you think long after its ending - if you can understand the underlying message.",The Wailing

(Spoilers follow, because I'm not sure how to articulate my dissatisfaction without talking about the story.)I was a big fan of The Chaser, and went in with high expectations.At the end of this experience, I'm left with many unanswered questions, and not the good kind. Not philosophical questions, not questions about symbolism. Instead, my questions are why we spent so darn long following threads that were ultimately little more than red herrings. Why the first third of the film was just burning time pretending to be a comedy and withholding the main plot? Why did the events in the film happen at all? What was the point of this entire exercise?This is a whodunit with a dissatisfying who, because we don't have a WHY beyond 'crap happens, evil exists, deal with it.'There is also a lot of genre confusion, and while other reviewers have labeled this a positive things, to me it just felt like a bunch of stuff tagged on for the sake of being tagged. Is this a possession/exorcism film? A zombie movie? A conspiracy thriller? A murder mystery? A comedy? It pulls from so many of the tropes that at the end of it I feel like I spent more time trying to figure out what film I was watching that just being able to watch the film.So, a bunch of negative feedback so far, but you'll note I still gave the film a 5/10. Lots of great cinematic moments in here. The locations, design and cinematography are mostly very satisfying. There is one sequence in particular (the major exorcism) that was incredibly compelling. And despite my hate for all the comedy at the beginning of the film being part of the genre noise, it was funny and enjoyable. Also some great performances, in particular from the child actor.Anyway, if you wanted to watch this film because you were a fan of The Chaser, go right ahead, just temper your expectations.It doesn't have The Chaser's palpable sense of dread and power. This is not a particularly frightening, emotionally moving or satisfying film, but it's got some good moments that make the experience not a complete waste.",The Wailing

Gokseong is directed by Hong-jin Na who previously have made very fine movies like yellow sea and chaser. But the setting of this movie is different from those movies, It kind of felt like Memories of Murder in darker tone. This is the story of a village, where people are suffering from a mysterious diseases which seems like some kind of virus and this ends up killing them, and in the middle of somewhere a Japanese stranger seems to be involved in this. Now, i'm not going to say more than that about the story , and i suggest you to not watch the trailer which doesn't do justice to the movie and stay away from any possible spoiler. It is one of the best horror movies i have seen in long time, it doesn't have jump scares. But what this movie does, it slowly grows on you, you will be confused, conflicted, disgusted while watching this. Somewhere you will make a choice, a perspective to the way things are going and possibly will be wrong. So i strongly suggest you to watch this movie if possible in a secluded environment and if possible alone. P.S.- It has the what i think is the best exorcism scene shown in any movie.",The Wailing

260,KhashayarEmamifard,One of the Best Korean Movie,8,30 July 2017,"The Wailing (Gokseong in Korean) is a 2016 South Korean horror movie directed by Na Hong-Jin. The movie is set in a little village in the mountains of South Korea and it's about a police officer named Jong- Goo (Kwak Do-hon) who investigates a series of mysterious killings and illnesses. At first the police department thinks that killings is just a normal kind of killing, but as time passes and more bodies being found, Jong-goo knows that something is wrong. A mysterious disease starts spreading among the villagers, causing a rash which precedes violent murderous outbreaks followed by stupor and eventually death! When Jong-goo's daughter is also become sick like the others, the main story of the movies begins. He see a girl with white dress in front of one of the victims house that she claims she knows who is responsible for this disease and killing, a Japanese stranger who lives in a cabin in the woods...I highly recommend The Wailing to horror movie fans who liked movies Rosemary's Baby, I Saw the Devil and The Exorcist. It has a combination of those three movies but in a new and strange way in 2016! You always guess one thing gonna happen, but the movie shows that in another way, specially at the end of the movie all of your guesses might be wrong... or maybe right! The actors played very good and Kwak Do-hon nailed it as a father and a policeman.It had only one problem that maybe it's just my problem : Running Time. The movie is 156 minutes, for a horror movie it was really long and the tempo and rhythm of the movie in the middle was slow. Maybe if they did a better editing and cut the non-important parts, it would've became a perfect horror movie in all aspects.

This movie was after all, a big hit in Korea, and heard some good things about this from my Korean friends. I normally don't seek out for horror movies, but this had interesting element of occult, shamanism, drama and thrill of constantly guessing the ""Keyser Söze"" It has a pretty long run time but it won't feel boring. The movie gives you some hints and clues here and there about the conclusion of the story, but the best part is that you will be never sure of your guess till the very end. Right at the end of the story you will be sorry for the protagonist's agony on whom to believe, whom not to trust because you won't be sure of it yourself. About the time when you get there and everything starts coming together, the movie would be over. It's not one of the horror movies that you find sadness more than horror(Like a lot of Korean horror movies) It's more to give you a chill with higher power or spirituality, or things that you cannot fully control. Things happen without your control can give you a great horror, as this movie presents, no one involved was really at fault. They weren't bullies; they weren't special. Culturally, I felt Korean ghosts/spirituality focuses on what injustice has been done to the spirit, which involves a form of Karma. But one thing I thought greatly differed in Japanese ghost stories was that most of them got the fury of the spirits by bad luck - like touching something they shouldn't have.

271,coreanoyung,"So, why Zombie?",7,28 June 2016,"Going through some reviews, found an argument about the zombie scene. Obviously it was not just put to follow and entail the current fashion for this typical horror element. This 'horror' film is well smartly structured in the sense of merging large and different fractures of horror genre: initially that of Exorcism running through the whole 2.5 hours, then a little bit of 'I know what you did last summer' as shown in car accident scene. Also a stereotype mise-en-scene of 'Texas Chainsaw' is found in rooms of the Japanese guy. And it doesn't end just yet: the transform of a human to a demon figure reminds 'Evil's advocate' - putting aside the genre of it - and other similar movies. Lastly the taste of Japanese horror films is also added in many points. And zombie is also a part of this orchestra of different kinds of horror, completing the purpose of the director in building such dynamic composition. Few years ago when 'Cabin in the woods' was released it was described as the horror version of a box of chocolate. Now 'Goksung' also reveals a similar sense yet in an apparently different manner. Yes, the former is built in Hollywood and the later in South Korea and we know how Korean movies usually are. 'Goksung' entails many stereotypes of Korean movie, but for me it is one-of-a-kind horror movie produced in Korea so far.

The main character is not a superhero saving everybody, NO ! he's an attaching anti hero who make mistakes and fails. During all the movie, the viewer feel unpowerfull as if it was something scary that would happens in our lives and you just don't know what to do and can't control it. The sad ending makes it even more realistic, and I love this movie so much that I really hope for a Wailing 2 !!!",The Wailing
273,ensureshake,Screaming Cops,4,9 September 2016,"Two cops who act like scared high school kids. They run around a lot and scream. After that, I couldn't take anything this movie had serious. Maybe it is a comedy and I missed the whole premise. If this was made as some serious drama or horror movie I can't understand why they would have the police who are central characters act like teenage girls in a Friday 13th movie.The scenes that are made to be a suspenseful fail because of the sissy behavior of our hero cops. When our police are faced with danger you might expect a weapon to be drawn certainly not the reactions we are presented with. Screaming, running away, tripping and falling down. How can you not be confused",The Wailing
274,krunalkawale,Utter waste of your time,1,24 May 2021,Sorry I have not been an active reviewer for any of the movies I watched yet but The Wailing really made me write abt it.This one is a Cringe.Worst film. I can't even believe why is it touted to be one of the best horror/ mystery. The good ratings are so manoeuvred.This one will test your patience till the end. Story doesn't make any sense. Neither it gives a satisfactory end nor it becomes any unique in terms of the story.Acting is pathetic. There were no bone chilling scenes. Worst in the lot. South Korea has given us better films than this one.K-movies are known for their storyline and uniqueness in each details they mention. The wailing misses everything.,The Wailing
275,thenewahm,"Thrilling, Sad and Mysterious",10,28 November 2017,I didn't expect to come here and write that this is the best film I ever watched. It's all about a major trouble that almost faces everyone on Earth. I felt that the writer and director of the movie was right when he said that the movie is a condolence for people who suffered from such problems. Greetings to him and to South Korea for providing us such masterpieces from time to time.,The Wailing
276,sohdas,The P R E S T I G E of horror movies,9,2 January 2018,"Truly a masterpiece, the first film that I've found that has come close to touching the feeling that the Prestige instilled in me. 9/10.",The Wailing
277,subphilomusicgroup,Such a weird movie,5,12 January 2017,"Its weird I love the cinematography, the vibe, almost everything about this movie except for the over the top, silly acting, its so weird and hard to relate too that I ended up not liking this movie. The main character is obnoxious to a point that I don't really care what happens to him or his family. All of his friends that help him too are hard to watch. The length is a little bit long I thought a lot could be cut out of this movie. Its too bad if it was acted by someone who was half sane this movie would be amazing. I would love to see a American remake of it even if it was set in Korea with a couple really good actors.",The Wailing
278,muhammadfaza,Masterpiece!,10,2 April 2020,"Another Korean film that really impressed me so much. This film is absolutely broke your faith again and again. So don't trust anyone😐. All aspects is perfect. And the most important is the jumpscare moment is just once😂 The rest of it is just a brilliant and scary atmosphere that not so many Hollywood movie can't do right now. If you haven't watch this movie yet, I recommend you to watch this movie ASAP bcs this is a masterpiece!",The Wailing
279,laojerry,They can all die its not worth it,5,8 April 2017,"If only I could reach my hand through my TV screen and kill these idiots myself... esp the main ""good"" guy, what a pathetic weakling. I really hope Korea is not full of fumbling bumbling screaming idiots as portrayed in this film.If you like movies where you are frustrated with how idiotic the characters are and don't really care if they live or die, then this is a great movie for you. Otherwise.. save yourself some time.",The Wailing
280,johnbennettgsr,Awful,1,12 May 2018,I cannot believe all the positive reviews. This was worse than watching paint dry. Actually watching a awful rerun of Ronda Shearer's Up All Night with a equally awful Linnea Quigley-Brinke Stevens double feature would have been far less painful,The Wailing
281,maracinepaul,The WAITING.....,2,17 February 2020,"I can't believe it... 2:30 hours for this. I can cut it now to 45 min and make it better...
Maby i'm in a different culture or something, but if this is suposed tonbe good here...
Jesus!",The Wailing
282,phanidoc,Waste of time,1,27 March 2021,One of the worst movie which I've ever seen...please don't watch & waste your valuable 3 hrs in your life....😡,The Wailing
283,nymphazy,Ritual scenes are very convincing but that's all,6,28 July 2021,It was going great until I realized that there was an hour left. It's too long for a horror movie besides scenario repeats itself which is extremely tedious. End of the movie was nonsense. I waited 156 minutes straight and I got nothing when it ended. It could be better if it was around 90 minutes.,The Wailing
