0,Leofwine_draca,In the doldrums,4,11 September 2021,This was really disappointing. I expected some kind of creepy haunted house movie but instead what I got was a low key stalking thriller going through the motions. It's supposedly based on a true story but is so far from the truth as to be make believe. It's another run of the old 'living in the house' plotline which has been done so many times before; if you want to see a good version try the Spanish movie SLEEP TIGHT. Kudos for Ashley Greene and Shawn Ashmore for doing their best with the protagonists but they can't lift this one from the doldrums.,Aftermath
1,kosmasp,What not to do,7,4 August 2021,"A couple of weeks ago I saw a meme on social media, that showed a happy family entering a house - the meme saying that every family in horror movies when it comes to houses where someone was killed in. Well if you think that is funny because it is ""true"" (we're talking movies and plot and all that), you may have an issue with the movie on hand already.It also seems a bit all over the place when it comes to the couple and their issues (marital and otherwise). But it is suspensful and if you are able to stick with it (suspend your disbelief) ... you have a neat and decent little horror film to watch. The ending reminded me of at least one other movie I watched recently - but can you hold it against this movie?",Aftermath
2,851222,Not bad flick,7,9 August 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Aftermath"" (2021) was a pretty descent haunted house horror flick. It wasn't the best and wasn't the worst. It was pretty well paced - at running time 1 h 50 min. I wasn't bored because of pretty descent writing, pretty solid directing and kinda good performance by Ashley Greene. The ending was OK.Overall, ""Aftermath"" is a nice little horror flick. On a boring evening its not a worst movie to watch for sure, kinda even nice one. Not bad flick to see it once.",Aftermath
3,wandernn1-81-683274,WOW!!! JUST WOW!!!,2,22 August 2021,"So a crime scene cleanup guy, whose wife cheated on him, is going to couples therapy and looking for a different place to live.There are some funny lines in this. The cheating wife's sister plays like the cheating wife is the victim here. That angry hubby should just get over it. Sorry bee-yotch but it doesn't just automatically work that way now does it?What I really don't get, is that if he's such an Angry Andy then why is he constantly flirting with and romancing his wife??? It doesn't really make much sense. -1 Star.But I guess he finally decides to reswim those waters in the new home. And we almost get a worthwhile sex scene. Almost but not quite. -1 StarOkay this one heading downhill fast. Wife wakes up to a freezing house, thermostat reads 31 degrees. Then, we get a couple more nude scenes with no nudes. Big no no for me, shower scene with no nudity. -1 StarAbout to turn this pile of S off. Will it pass muster and so 1 thing right??? Lamplighter keeps getting deliveries that he never ordered. So is this some haunting by the spirit of Jeff Bezos or something just sending him stuff???Okay the scene where sis gets taken by the closet monster was cool. I'll give back a star just so I won't have to shut this off the next stupid scene. +1 Star.The dog ends up poisoned. Sister is still missing. They keep hearing things in the house and not finding anything when they search. Lamplighter finds out that his wife is still doing 'business' with the dude she cheated on him with. You should all realize women who wear hoop earrings of large size cannot be trusted. Ever. This woman here and Laurie from Walking Dead, prime examples.Okay the Chlamydia story told by Dufus Magoo on the clean up crew was funny. +1 Star.So the wife, she's seeing things in the house. The cameras and the cops aren't seeing anything in the house. The husband now is getting berium poisoning.Oh now some rapist breaks in??? Bahahahaha, and the convenient scissors close by??? -1 Star !!!! Wow how dumb!!Oh hahaha. I prefer to be taken by surprise. Okay we shall restore +1 Star.So dude is taken into custody and then couple talks about separating. Wait, now something is showing up on camera? But it didn't show up before? Why show up now??So, after all this, there's a dude living in the basement of their house??? You serious??? -1 STAR!!!!Oh and there was a bathtub scene AGAIN, no NUDITY!!! -1 Star.Well Lamplighter comes home, wifey is chained in the basement by basement man. Wifey escapes, shouts out warning Lamplighter. Theres a basement man Lamplighter fight, then a basement man wifey fight. Lampy and Wifey WIN!!!!!Okay skip to 1 month LATER!!! More Wifey/Lampy FLIRTING??? Oh Dear Lord, even Dufus Magoo humor can't save the end scene.Absolutely horrid!!! But I did make it to the end!!! 2/10.",Aftermath
4,Pairic,A House of Horror,7,5 August 2021,"Aftermath: A couple with a troubled relationship buy a house where a murder/suicide took place which they get at a bargain price. The husband heads a crew which cleans up crime sites and yes they looked after that job. Strange things start to happen, their dog seemingly barks at nothing, won't go upstairs. Things disappear and reappear in different paces. Identity theft occurs. In this case the mundane rather than mondo events seem more threatening as a gradual aura of dread builds up. The oddities become eerier and nastier, a woman hiding in a walk in closet is dragged backwards through the hanging clothes. Red herrings are strewn as possible culprits are introduced but there are several levels to this narrative of terror with a couple of interesting plot twists. Nothing particularly original about this tale but it's well told and worth watching. Directed and co-written by Peter Winther. On Netflix. 7/10.",Aftermath
5,TdSmth5,Yet another lame haunted house movie,4,9 August 2021,"A couple going through a rough patch decides to get a new house, as part of the start fresh approach recommended by their therapist, after the wife cheated on the husband.He's part of a crew that cleans up homes after grisly crimes took place there. The house they just bought is actually one such place that he cleaned up not long ago after the homeowners committed murder-suicide.The wife is a fashion designer on the verge to making it big thanks to an investor who happens to be none other than her ex-lover.She isn't thrilled about the place but agrees because of the convenient price. Their dog right away senses that something isn't right. Little by little stuff happens that drives the wife crazy. They call the cops who don't have any evidence to do anything.The former owner also acts all weird thinking they took advantage of his wife by buying the house on the cheap and he actually wants to buy it back.Eventually we learn that the girl isn't crazy, that there is something going on in the house.Aftermath is a rather lazy, unimaginative version of the haunted house script that offers little. And you can't get away with doing yet another haunted house movie while not offering anything new, interesting, different. There's no nudity, little gore and violence, no ideas, in other words no reason to see this.",Aftermath

9,gianmarcoronconi,Good,7,5 October 2021,"Horror film with a good level of tension, even if the plot is very mundane the film is quite good. He manages to entertain and scare at the right level while also giving the right amount of suspense and disbelief without ever going into the paranormal.",Aftermath
10,PsychoBeard666,This was a solid movie until the last 20 minutes.,5,7 October 2021,Starts out as a decent haunted house movie with a questionable but manageable plot.With 30 minutes to go it starts to decline then 10 minutes later it jumps the shark completely.Avoid.,Aftermath
11,Sir_AmirSyarif,"Not terrible, but for the most part is rather bland",4,5 August 2021,"A couple thinks buying and moving to a house where a grisly murder-suicide once occurred could help them with their marriage problems. This may sound like a pretty familiar premise and in a lot of ways it is. Peter Winther's 'Aftermath' is not terrible, but for the most part is rather bland because of its weak story and characters, mediocre acting, and uninspired direction.",Aftermath
12,Movi3DO,Mediocre,4,13 August 2021,"Haunted house timeA recent horror mystery on Netflix. Based on a true story, a couple moved into a house with a dark past, and started experiencing creepy occurrences.As a haunted house movie, there were few surprises. Things just progressed in a predictable way. As one of the character experienced more weird occurrences around the house, she got ridiculed by her husband and cop. This was done many times before, but this movie's horrible dialogues and pretty bad acting from the cast didn't ruined the tension and urgency. It was definitely too long and did not hook me into the mystery.Besides the good-looking house, this movie felt cheap, probably because of the sound effects and horror. There were so many predictable jump scares that irritated me. I had to admit tho, that one or two scenes didn't use jump scares and did creep me out a little.And then the revelation, not only was it predictable, but it was also bad. It wasn't scary at all. The design, look, and acting were all amateur.Overall, despite some decent moments, it's just another cheap and cliche horror on Netflix. 4/10.",Aftermath
13,apryla-58795,The very last gesture all the actors do shows you what the directors thought of us,6,16 August 2021,"Ok...this actually wasn't bad...AND that's why I KNEW it was gonna fall apart at the end and turn out to be straight STOOPID! And I was 1000% correct about that!Many reviewers don't get who Otto is...that was explained by the sister of the brother who was murdered at the beginning. The murdered wife had an affair with Otto and designed the house so that he could live in the walls with her WHILE SHE'S STILL MARRIED TO AND LIVING WITH HER HUSBAND!! That's the first red flag...at no point did the husband and wife visit the house while it was being built? Yes they would have...so that secret room would've been known about right from the start. I suppose the wife could've played it off like a place to hide if they needed to in the event of a home invasion or whatever but c'mon!So Otto lost his mind at some point and killed his lover and her husband. And then just hunkered down and stayed in the house. That was dumb.And then at the end they try to throw in a twist by showing the closet door opening but that's dumb because Otto is dead. The only thing I can think of is they are leading us to believe it is the sister of the guy who died at the beginning but that makes zero sense. There was no reason for that. They should've ended it without the ""Month later"" thing. Then it would've been fine. Why do directors feel like they have to put in some dramatic twist ending all the time?! It just ruins the whole thing!Then finally they all flip the house off at the end. I mean...that was a bit of tongue in cheek like ""Eff you audience! You just got played by all of us!""I wish that movies would have good endings. I hate when a film is fairly decent all the way through and then the ending happens and it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Why don't directors start with an ending and work back? Who cares if the film is ok all the way through if the director is just gonna give up at the end?Also there is no way Otto wouldn't have shown up on camera. No one would be staying in a house after almost being raped by an intruder but they thought they'd cover that by having the husband say ""Where you gonna stay? Our credit cards are maxed out."" Ok what about the Mom or the sister? I know she didn't like her Mom but desperate times...also Ashley Graham's character didn't know that her sister wasn't really away but even though she thought that why didn't they show her at least trying to reach out? Also the sister looked like she was in an advanced state of decomposition which means she would've been dead for awhile so there wouldn't have been blood. I thought that it was actually Otto in the bed and that he would turn and inject Shawn Ashmore when he got in bed. I guess that was too logical for the writers. Why didn't Otto attempt to shower, brush his teeth or at least steal some clothes to replace his tattered ones? There's just too many glaring things that are so dumb. It's an insult to the intelligence of the audience.I can't say I'd recommend this.",Aftermath
14,Stanlee107,The maths do not add up,4,30 August 2021,"I always wary when it states ""based on a true story"". This family drama film with a side story of 'strange happenings' in the house... Is the female lead having nightmares or is it supernatural or
is it something else? The main 2 protagonists are established actors.It is watchable enough & I guessed the 'twist' before the game by reveal. That was very anticlimactic to say the least....",Aftermath

Someone said this movie is absolutely amazing..ya right buddy..What the hell were you watching lol. This movie was boring. And why was it so long? Total garbage. Low budget and mediocre acting. Definitely wasted my time watching this. Nothing happens..Literally..,Aftermath
17,PedroPires90,Lazy,4,11 August 2021,"I don't consider this an offensively bad movie, one of those that makes you want to forget about movies for a while. At a time that good thrillers are scarce, the cast and the mystery can even entertain you, while you are trying to unravel the plot. However, what it does is not enough. It's too long, too lazy and looks like it was made straight for television. It follows a predictable structure and will be quickly forgotten by everyone.",Aftermath
18,Rrrobert,Chills,6,6 August 2021,"Fits the modern 'streaming' model of filmmaking: small cast and a story where most scenes have only one, two, or three characters, lots of text messages, and most of the film takes place in the same big, modern, expensive home.This one has some obnoxious, insufferable characters and many prickly interactions. However, I was watching for the chills and those were good. The scary parts were well done. The wife's ordeal was well executed.",Aftermath
19,jeroduptown,The Walls,5,7 August 2021,"The guy in the walls thing has been done before, but despite the major plot holes - he's still a scary dude.",Aftermath
20,Just-A-Girl-14,Trying too hard,6,7 August 2021,"This movie had some good things going for it. Good cast, beautiful setting, interesting storyline (at least at first), decent pace and a lovely dog (which, btw, in reality would have caught the intruder like a million times).Problem is they were trying too hard to surprise the viewers that they ended up complicating the story too much to the point it became dumb. Too many unexplained things going on and worst of all was the interaction between the two main characters. I get you have difficulties but who acts like that? The only horror here was this marriage. Sorry to say this but if your marriage is that worse, get out as fast as you can. Seriously.Also, any one of the ""incidents"" that occurred in the house would have been enough for them (or at least for the wife) to say ""I'm out of here! I'm not staying here another second"". But no, she kept staying in house all alone. Go to a friend's house or to the cheapest motel you can find... whatever, just don't stay there! I mean, they did move out eventually right?! Are we supposed to believe they couldn't do it before but after everything that inspired the house's value went up? It's ridiculous!I wish the makers of this movie cared more about the quality of it, instead of trying too hard to make it new and edgy. A good horror thriller is hard to find anyways so better to care more about quality than originality.Cast did a good job but the stupid behavior and unexplained questions made it into a bad movie.6/10And in case you are wondering here are the biggest plot holes and unanswered questions:
Why was this guy in such a bad shape (both physically and mentally)? Why live in the walls for so long? Why didn't the police do a DNA test on the clearly unidentifiable corpse? Why did he kill the sister? Why wasn't anyone looking for the sister? And don't give me that one text message as an excuse because that's nowhere near enough. Why didn't the dog catch the intruder? Like for example when he put the tennis ball on the bed (she was out of the room for exactly ten seconds which mean the intruder was real close by). Dogs would know a stranger is in the house. Why was he harassing and attacking the two in the first place? Why poison the husband and attack the wife? Why try and kill them? What's his story? I can go on and on but lastly (like I've already mentioned): WHY DO YOU KEEP STAYING THERE?? The car, the message on the mirror, the music, the water, the pornography, the tennis ball, the text messages, the photos, the THREE separate attacks, the dog... Do you really need to be chained to a wall before you decide to move out? One, two, maybe three incidents I get but everything? I wouldn't leave the house because the mirror or the pornography because it's hard to make a connection but the tennis ball and the photos of you sleeping?? Come on! It's idiotic!But hey, thankfully the ending was happy... One month later and they were all smiles. The deaths, the traumas, the financial problems, the marital problems... All went away with a flip of a finger (literally). Laughable!",Aftermath
21,Mehki_Girl,There is A Similar Story in History *spoilers*,6,5 August 2021,"There was a woman who kept her lover living in an attic for a decade. (See below). This movie did keep me guessing. Not that great, but not so bad to deserve a 1. It kept my attention and I was entertained.Walburga Oesterreich (née Korschel; 1880 - April 8, 1961), nicknamed ""Dolly"", was a German-born American housewife, married to a wealthy textile manufacturer Fred William Oesterreich (December 8, 1877 - August 22, 1922), who gained notoriety for the shooting death of her husband and the subsequent bizarre revelation that she had kept her lover, Otto Sanhuber, hidden in the attic of the home she shared with her husband for ten years.",Aftermath
22,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,5 August 2021,"Good Morrow.For genre fans, there is a sub-sub Genre that I call ""people in walls."" I credit 1786's Crawlspace with creating the concept of a hidden threat living in your domicile. There might be earlier examples. Recently, The Boy, Within and the excellent, Housebound all had similar themes...
...a psycho nut living right under your roof and messing with your existence.In this low-budget Lifetime'esq flick, you get another example of the genre.This film explores no new ground and the (at least for me) the ""twist"" was guessed immediately. With that, it was a passable way to waste some time. As a bonus ""twist,"" I didn't detect any overly w0ke themes.Cheers.",Aftermath
23,baunacholi-86159,Actually quite entertaining,6,19 October 2021,"Don't get the low ratings at all but feel free to discover yourself. I found a thriller with quite some intense and creepy moments. The usual story of happy - or in this case not so happy couple - moves into a new home and soon strange things happen, is not new but they managed to create something unusual.... Is it something supernatural? A home invasion? Or hallucination? It plays well with your perception and gives enough red herrings to stay on track. The 1st reveal SPOILER AHEAD... Is shocking esp as this aspect is based on actual events happening a few years ago, when a family got threatened and harassed by somebody who wanted their home herself. The 2nd final reveal SPOILER... somebody lived inside the walls, is frighting however executed not as convincing as it could have been.",Aftermath

26,bangel3322,Had potential to be so much better,5,10 August 2021,"I wouldn't really class this as a horror film. It makes itself out to be, but once you realise what's going on, it's more a thriller. Now for me, this wasn't anything really new. Because the plot is similar to films I've seen before, for example, The Pact, Hider in the House, or Black Christmas. So it lost its originality there. I know this is based on a true story, but that true story took a backseat to the main fictionalised story involving the guy living in their walls. They should have scrapped that; as I said it's been done many times before, and just elaborated on the true story of Jerry Rice and Janice Ruhter which was much more interesting. That would have made a more enjoyable film.Nevertheless it was still an average watch with some decent performances.",Aftermath

It was so bad. I felt like i was watching a really badly dubbed foreign movie with really bad voice actors... but it wasn't dubbed.I don't think the actors are completely to blame, the script was just pathetic, truly awful, forced lines completely unrealistic and ridiculous, it doesn't matter what actor or actress is saying it it'll never work, and it was almost constant, even in the trailer you can see how awful it is.",Aftermath

The movie itself will leave no impressions. Kevin and Natalie don't come across as a married couple. More like two college friends that have moved in together but didn't live together in college. This dialogue comes across as young for two adults well into their careers and marriage. The thing I didn't understand was why was the stalker mute? I still don't know who he was exactly. Was he the husband/brother or was he the mister? 4 stars is generous. Not really a horror or thriller, more like home invasion drama.",Aftermath

33,ladymidath,Not What I Expected,8,4 August 2021,"I started watching Aftermath expecting a haunted house movie and halfway through I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking, yes another movie that starts off as a haunted house movie and ends up being a movie where people are being terrorised by very real people instead. I clocked very early that it was the seller's husband and nearly turned the film off, but decided to stick with it. Then it turned out to be some creepy dude hiding in the house, (as well as the house seller's husband.) Then at the very end, a door mysteriously swings shut.I think I would have liked this movie a lot more if it had been a haunted house film, but that's me. The problem with this movie is that it was so easy to guess who was targeting the couple who bought the house, although the creepy dude was something I didn't see coming.The acting was good and there were some very scary moments. It does build up tension but the payoff was easy to see coming.It's not a bad film, but it's one that I would not bother watching again.",Aftermath
34,Mivas_Greece,"A smart balance between reality and metaphysical mystery. Not very intense, but still worth a watch.",6,4 September 2021,"Mystery / thriller movie. A couple who are going through a crisis in their relationship follow the advice of a psychologist to change the environment and finally buy a house at a bargain price as a double murder was committed inside, but they really need a change, so eventually they buy it. Very soon strange things happen and the terrified woman does not know if what she is experiencing is true or a part of her imagination/nightmares. She basically senses the presence of an intruder, but her guy tries to find logical explanations for what is happening. The film is watched with interest and balances between the real and the metaphysical, confusing the viewers until some explanations are given close to the ending about what is happening in the house. Overall it reminded me a lot of the style and the idea of the movie I see you (2019), but this one is much lighter without a lot of action and tension as a whole. Perhaps with shorter duration it would have been more intense, as there were many unnecessary things in the film that could be removed (especially language). It is still worth a watch.",Aftermath

Nothing that I will remember because it was predictable and cliche white couple moves into *surprise surprise* haunted house. Even the plot twist seemed cliche and The Boy (2016) was a lot better horror movie.I think it could have been a bit better if it didnt leave so many unfinished questions. Why was the sister killed, and why didnt her sudden disapearance raise any questions? Why didnt Natalie grieve her sister's death at all? What happened to the guy who turned Evil, and what made him go crazy - I thought he had lived a normal life until he met the wife, so, why he all evil and crazy now?

Run time is a little too long. Employs the ""smart woman/dumb woman"" routine. Tries to blame the husband for the wife's infidelity. No one thinks to arm themselves. Skinny dude throwing people around like he's the Hulk. Threw in some completely unnecessary FAKE woke. For example, Sarena says:""The cops didn't care about any of that. It's not like it was a white mans murder.""Huh? We see the female victim in the beginning. We also see some pictures of her later in the movie. Sorry, but she looks white to me. Next, the lead detective was black. In fact, all the professionals in positions of importance were minorities (Detective, Psychologist, Doctor, Rich Business Owner & Natalie's new Boss, - even the Vet.) With this in mind, are we supposed to believe they only care about ""white"" people? Major distraction. I didn't even notice and definitely did not care what anyone's complexion was until this statement made it an issue.Last but definitely not least, the husband didn't sleep with Avery.

And if Kevin wasn't a part of it, why didn't he EVER believe that Natalie saw someone in that house? Or any of the other crazy occurrences? I also thought their house might be haunted by the murder/suicide couple who live there before them. And if it wasn't any of these scenarios, the culprit would have to be real person messing with them for some reason.STOP NOW if you don't want to know the ending!The person causing all of the trouble, ended up being the lover of the previous married woman who lived there before. The woman, whose husband supposedly shot her and then himself. So, WHY is her lover living inside the walls of this house? Did she coerce him to come over, by saying she wanted him and not her husband? And then after changing her mind, maybe she held him captive or something? And this caused him to go crazy and kill her and the husband? Then he terrorized the new owners, Kevin and Natalie? If I understood the why and how, this movie would be so much better. I guess the only reasonable explanation would be that after the wife rejected him, he snapped and killed her. Then he killed the husband, making it look like murder-suicide. After that, he must've went crazy and started living in the walls?There are some very decent creepy scenes and attacks that make this movie worth watching.

The acting is OK -- not great, but adequate. The plot is imperfect, but perfect (more accurately nearly perfect) plots are exceedingly rare. It doesn't break new ground or offer a metaphysical experience, but many respectable movies don't. It's by no means an arthouse film, but it's fun to watch, and offers effective suspense with a few goose bumpy creep outs thrown in for good measure. It's escapist entertainment that's just fine for passing some time, and pass it does. The 114-minute running time, which I initially (and wrongly) found to be off-putting/too long for the genre, seemed surprisingly short.As far as some of these reviews go, I have to ask: How does a review help others if it's so dishonest and hyperbolic that it counts an average, competent thriller among the worst movies ever made? Because it quite obviously is not. Perhaps it's part and parcel of the terribly sad cultural space we currently occupy -- a childish, egocentric zeitgeist that demands if one dislikes a thing, it must be demonized, deligitimized, and deemed unworthy of existence lest it pollute the minds of others less intelligent and discerning than oneself.I'm getting carried away, but only slightly.I will try to be helpful to folks who just want to kick back and watch a movie. Any rating between 4 and 7 for ""Aftermath"" is potentially defensible.

At first it seemed to be the right move but as time went on it seemed like it took too long to get to the point. The attempt to establish suspense through character build up and rapport left me with an underwhelming feeling towards the climax.Verdict:
This film isn't scary, it does take a while for it to get to the good stuff and during the hour or so it builds up the suspense isn't too pleasing.

She convinced him to cut down on work in order to continue his studies, all while they barely have money.What happened to all of those plot threads? The whole premise of this stupid movie is that he doesn't trust his wife because she cheated on him. That's the only reason the situation they were in escalated so much.

They were talking about divorce and then all of a sudden they sold the house they couldn't sell, got a new dog and went on with their lives happily ever after?

The acting was not that bad as people claim. Anyone to claim they already knew what to expect to happen in this movie is just lying or they googled the back story to the film which completely ruins the whole movie 100% and gave them already the ending before they even began to watch.Or maybe they just read reviews that had spoiler alerts?

Which threw me off as most horror movies always input specific Loud Jump scare scenes at certain obvious moments always but not this one for aCouple of particular moments in the movie.Now the script could have been written better as some things could have been explored more thoroughly and explained or maybe some parts were not needed but overall i was pretty satisfied with movie.So remember DO NOT Google anything about this movie or the back story that inspired it and just watch it and enjoy the movie.

They move into a new house that they bought too cheaply. Strange things soon start to happen in the house. There are a lot of details that bother me: someone who is a fashion designer but dresses like a gray office clerck? Someone who studies architecture but never studies the floor plan of the house and never discovers hidden rooms? It is clearly summer or at least winter in a region with a warm climate (you see actors wearing shorts, t-shirts, sandals...) and yet the air con manages to bring the temperature in the bedroom down to freezing point? The triple haunted house/mentally ill/stalked plot twist also causes discontinuity with evidence. On security images we don't see the stalker while he should be there, as it is confirmed later he is no ghost nor illusion.

86,myignisrules,Well acted but predictable 5.5 out of 10,5,8 August 2021,"Aftermath is one of those standard thrillers you tend to find on channels like Lifetime and TNT. A young couple looking for a fresh start luck in on the opportunity to buy a luxurious smart house. Things start off well enough, only to slowly degrade as time goes by, putting a strain on their already strained marriage and to top it all off, there's something lurking in the shadows. Did I mention the previous owners died horrifically in said house? Don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything as this is literally the opening scene for this movie and it sets the tone for what's to come.Shawn Ashmore, not to be mistaken for his twin Aaron (the former was an X-Man the latter starred in the awesome SyFy series Killjoys) plays Kevin, the husband half of our duo who cleans up after crime scenes for a living after he dropped out of college. Ashley Greene most well known from The Twilight Saga (I wonder how she feels about that) is his wife Natalie, an aspiring fashion designer and together with a few other actors, some more recognisable than the rest, make up the cast of this by-the-numbers thriller.I'll give points for atmosphere. This movie is at its strongest when it focuses on the house and the young couple trapped in its nightmare. The house itself is quite lovely and if it wasn't for the murders, I could totally see myself living in it (that backyard is amazing) There are some solid suspenseful moments here and a great use of light and shadow in the darker scenes. The sound design also works well at upping the creep factor. Both Shawn and Ashley do a solid job of portraying a young couple who love each other, but are struggling with past indiscretions and financial burdens that threaten to tear them apart. I was rooting for them to make it through, which speaks volumes about their performances.Otherwise what we have here is pretty standard. I figured out what was happening from the moment they moved into the house and checked out the closet. Maybe it's because I've seen so many films, it's become that much harder for me to be surprised. It doesn't mean other viewers will have the same issues I did, but for me the predictability made it harder to enjoy myself as I sat there and waited for them to pull the curtain back, not because I didn't know what was behind it but because it would mean the movie was over.I think casual viewers will enjoy Aftermath, especially those that get a kick out of these types of thrillers, but for those who prefer something with a bit more twists and turns to it, Aftermath doesn't offer enough to keep your eyes glued to your television, instead of your phone.",Aftermath
87,JICNZ,Are You Allergic to Electric Light?,1,11 August 2021,"Seriously, every single time the woman heard someone creepy in the house in the middle of night she got up in the dark, walked around in the dark. No one turns on a fricking light in this film, despite music turning on by itself, doors slamming, footsteps, actually seeing someone crawling out from underneath your bed on the cameras. But, no, don't put a light on when you go to investigate. This film was so frustrating. People are not so detached from reality that when things literally move around in their house, people fire bomb their car, flowers get delivered from no one, photos appear on their phone they didn't put there, a skeletal figure emerges from the shadows inside the house, they shrug it all off with a 'oh, I must have been seeing things'. And the only one who did see it all and try to warn everyone was the dog! Again, you've had all these horrible experiences, the dog keeps barking and going mad at something, then it's poisoned and dies and you don't even once think... huh, no dog now to warn me... I wonder if the poisoning wasn't an accident. When a husband suspects his wife is poisoning him to the extent he refuses to take the lunch she packed for him, wouldn't it be better to take the lunch and get it analysed rather than alert her suspicions? Or take it and throw it away! Wow, is this really the level of writing on Hollywood now? The police have a house where a couple murder/suicided. Then another couple move in and report all these strange things. Detectives say 'we've done a thorough search of the house and there's nothing here', and yet the solution to the mystery is a frickin' man living in the crawl spaces with a mattress, CCVT systems, wifi, phones, food... and the police didn't find him... My God. What a completely asinine movie. And then, one month later, it's all forgotten and fine! What! You've been poisoned. Your dog has been killed.

91,srutimisra,Illogical movie,2,31 August 2021,"""Aftermath"" is an American psychological thriller film which is released recently on Netflix. The movie is based on true events. A young couple who are already dealing with their marital relationship issues, shift to a new house to rebuild their relationship. The previous owners of the house died because of murder and suicide. Paranormal activities started to happen as they moved in.Yes! We know the story, right! We watched the same story several times in so many movies. It became predictable from the very beginning. But they managed to keep the suspense on the line so I gave it a go. Honestly speaking, the only good actor was the dog. There are so many loopholes in the story. The climax was pathetic. Who took one month of time to shift to another house after so many tragedies happen with them?According to me, ""Aftermath"" is nothing but an illogical movie. You can give it a watch if you want.",Aftermath
92,shaunephillips28,Something is off about this movie,5,15 August 2021,"There seems to be a lot wrong with this movie and all of it gives the film an odd sense about it. Audio is out of sync sometimes, the frame rate lowers in some scenes like a game, the camera goes out of focus multiple times throughout the movie and the audio sounds like it's being recorded in a tin can. It all throws off the movie, but there's far more to it.One minute the characters are getting along like a happy couple. Next minute there are fighting like they never get along. It feels very schizophrenic. It's not realistic whatsoever. It's as if one scene is written by the writer forgetting their relationship issues and then in the next scene he hasn't. Sometimes horror movies write tension in a relationship thinking it's adding something, but it doesn't if it's inconsistent. For instance, they are having marital issues and seeing a counselor to work through their problems. Sometimes it feels like they are doing just that. Then they do the exact opposite of what they need to. They don't tell each other things they should and it's all because the writer wants these things to be an issue, but it's schizophrenic writing. Let's set this scene up where they get along like they're on their honeymoon and the next like they hate each other. It's frustrating to the point of annoyance. Characters don't say things like they should in reaction to what others say. There's a scene where they are talking to a police officer and they are being accused of something. Instead of saying there's no way we did that, the husband says something else that doesn't try to clear his name. It's super vague and weird. On top of that, a good chunk of the other characters are jerks. All because this is a horror suspense film. It's bad writing. I could go on and on about the problems with the film, but what I'm trying to get at is how much the issues take away from the movie. I want to watch a decent writen horror film and parts of it are, but I never know when the camera will go out of focus or if a character is going to do something stupid.Overall, it's worth a watch, but man, it's got some problems.",Aftermath

I, personally, felt exactly where this is going since minute 1 of this movie. I'm a horror fan, so I know the story this was 'based on' too well - shocking.

There were more than couple times where Natalie said or reacted in such a way where I thought ""man I felt that"".Now for the bad...
To echo what most others have already said, it's the same ol' same ol. Start off like some supernatural entity is causing a disturbance only to find out, nah it's just a plain old human, being weird for an unexplained reason.Secondly, while the movie was still pretending to be an act of the paranormal, Natalie's sister is ""taken"" and aside from a fake text that we later learn is clearly from the weird dude in the basement, her disappearance is a complete afterthought. The movie ends a month later, and no one seems to find it odd that Dani has not been seen or heard of since the events occurred.Then there's the typical detective who instead of doing any actual police work, spends all of his time low key accusing the victim of being crazy or a suspect. Any real law enforcement officer would have found that hiding spot, the first time they reported the house being broken into or very soon after.This weird dude who hasn't bathed in Lord knows how long, apparently doesn't reek of body order or our main characters have lost their ability to smell. He's also incapable of leaving any trace of dirt in this mostly WHITE clean house.Once it started coming together that all the weird stuff was an act of a human and not some malevolent spirit, you get overwhelmed with how ridiculous everything is.Like the motive for this dude to start messing with Natalie to begin with. The origin of the original owners is never fully explained either. Like why nobody noticed or cared that this Otto guy was missing. A house with two homicide victims, isn't combed through from the ground up? Not even when it's being sold? How a malnourished, smelly man with no human contact could somehow be so savvy he evaded any and all camera footage, leaves absolutely no trace of his being around by smell or even dirt. And could move about in such a manner where you can only assume he's not human? What did he eat in the entire time that house couldn't get sold? I could go on and on.

The characters have little to no character development, even though they were trying to throw some things around that made us care for the characters, but it just didn't work, the writing wasn't there and the couple interactions just felt bland.After a whole bunch of nothing, the movie wraps its last act in a sloppy way, with a twist you can see the moment the couple sets foot in the house.Now the real-life story is also not that exciting if you look it up, but if they actually really went at it, then it would have been a better thriller story than the clumsy thing we had.",Aftermath

No point in those scenes at all.There was no investigation as to what really was going on within the house and where was the character actually coming from within the house.

Why would the husband agree to build secret rooms behind walls? Did he never check in them after that?5. Why did he take her sister?

I know I said that the character work wasn't bad and it wasn't in the parts relating to building up the characters and making us understand their relationship and such, but whenever something scary or unexplained happened their reactions were just unbelievable.

One really good and another leaving you scratching. Aftermath, leaves you scratching your head.The script of the film feels like a first draft that had no re-writes, no corrections. The actors did the best with what they were handed but there is nothing they could do to save this film. The writing was weak and truly unbelievable. For some reason, The Protagonist moved quicker than a ninja. Yes, he had a secret room but that is it. It would make more sense if he had secret passages as well. There is no reason he could have done what he done without being seen or at least a glimpse of him.The climax was laughable. I have seen many of films where The Protagonist has captured the main actor in and this time was the worst. He had Ashley Greene chained and to keep her from warning her husband that he was coming for him, he stuffed a rag in her mouth. Now instead of just spitting the rag out , she needs to struggle and slip her hands out of the chains then pull the rag out of her mouth. Like I said laughable. The film was a failure on all levels.

Does he not experience cold like a regular person?Not sure how long the sister-in-law was dead but when you climb into a bed with a dead body, don't you usually smell that before you get cuddled up on top of them?She must have literally just been killed in the bed otherwise, why is he able to come up with a handful of wet blood but there's no trace of blood in the room to warn him?Do I even need to ask why no one was concerned that the person that was going to feed your dog just went permanently AWOL?Guy is ingesting poison and there's literally zero investigation into how that might be happening?Guy's dog dies from ingesting poison, no point in digging into that. Oh, s***, I guess we'll just get a new dog.I find these movies more frustrating than entertaining.I know this isn't a review as much as me whining about the movie.The acting wasn't horrible most of the time.

The dialogues are cringe-worthy most of the time and the acting is crap, the typical low budget acting, when whatever they're saying or doing doesn't feel completely *right*, there's always something off.Then, inside the wacky story there's the typical hysterical wife and the husband who doesn't believe her (even after he himself having experienced suspicious situations), there's the shrugging off of things that no one IRL would shrug off, there's cops not doing their job and just plainly screaming at the victim, there's a dog that only sometimes decides to alert others about an intruder, there's even a comedic relief duo ffs....On top of all that, the ""intruder"" is a damn ninja, fast, invisible, a master of hiding and camouflage and also likes to toy with his victims by opening faucets here and there, jiggling doorknobs, retrieving tennis balls from under furniture, playing vinyl suddenly, causing the occasional thud noise, using other people's mobiles without their consent. But then he's also feral and crazy and incapable of comunícate with words. He manages to avoid a whole camera surveillance system while chasing his victim (who appears in the surveillance footage), but couldn't stay away from a hand held camera places on a shelf and pointed directly at the couple's bed.This is insulting to anyone's intelligence.

If I'm to believe what the monster was, it literally doesn't make sense with previous things it supposedly does, like apparently being able to move around furniture that only 1 person can see but a camera can't. I don't get how the writers just blew this off, along with some other senseless decisions by the characters, and some situations that require too much suspension of disbelief. Ashley Greene is great in this, but she deserves better. Everybody else was fairly cheesy. The ending possibly intimates that there's more than 1 monster, but if so it wasn't fleshed out or integrated well. You can make up your own story I guess, this one was a mess and not well-directed.

So many things were left unanswered. Why did no one notice the sister had disappeared? The previous woman that lived in the house had an affair and asked her lover to live in the walls of the house... why did he agree to this? The length of time that seems to have gone by from him living in the walls to the final fight wouldn't have been long enough for him to have turned feral either. And once he had killed the first family, why did he continue to live in the walls and terrorise the next family? The original owners built the house, why did the husband not question why his wife wanted hidden rooms in the walls when they were building it? The police said they had reason to believe the brother in law had something to do with the family's death but it was never elaborated on.A lot of plot points could have also been cut to make it shorter. The dinner scene with the mother, the parts about the husband going back to college and his friendship with his classmate, the wife's job deal and all her meetings are just some of the things that were irrelevant to the progression of the story and seemed to be thrown in to extend the screen time.Overall if you're looking for a netflix horror with some cheap scares it's worth a watch but don't expect movie magic.",Aftermath

203,amsterdam230725,I'm confused,3,5 August 2021,"The final ""one month later"" scene where everyone lives happily ever after was actually almost laughoutloud funny. Ok so it's been one month since your sister(/in law) was murdered, your dog was murdered, and you were stalked, assaulted and nearly murdered by an actual freak monster, in addition to being brought in serious danger/stalked by a whole other, unrelated person. You already had serious marital and financial issues prior and unrelated to this. But it's all good now? Ok Aftermath. Also how did they sell the house and were happily moving out when previously it was an issue that they couldn't because they couldn't afford the financial loss? Surely the house didn't go up in value after EVERYTHING else that transpired? Why is everything solved? Why is no one extremely traumatised, in shock, grieving and broke? Maybe because it was already one month later tho.Two more things concerning the husband: 1 can we forever get rid of the spouse-not-being-believed trope, especially with the extremely lazy pop psychology ""oh she cheated on him so they have Trust Issues"". Would that really make him this sceptical that she has paranoid hallucinations and can't tell reality apart from nightmares anymore? Seems like kind of a different league of spousal suspicion. She herself literally showed him a bunch of pictures on her phone, terrified, that someone had taken of her while she was asleep, and he brushed it off with ""hmm idk maybe it was your BOYFRIEND"" and just left it at that snarky comment.

K.'s delivery was genuine and believable, the only watched this movie through to the end.The rest of the characters were caricatures, which is fine in a movie not about character development, but when the characters got involved in the plot, they made horribly unrealistic decisions. It was just how they were written. The sister remains nameless in my mind (also p sure they forgot about her lmao), but I just remember her saying nothing of importance or help the entire time she was on screen. She was literally written to die, but the little time that we saw her made her forgettable. Kudos if it was intended for us to enjoy her death.Don't get me started on what the pain of a bee sting on the foot should look like. If it's not supposed to be a moment to stay on or let the actress act out, why not go for something more minor like a splinter? Moments like this broke me out of the environment and I'm not sure who's at fault for that.Finally, and most importantly, the continuity was JARRing. Ashley ""chugging"" her 10ml of champagne. Getting chased around the house at 2mph. Ash ran from one room to another, and I swear to god there was a 7-second still shot of her just trying to unlock the door.. during the chase scene lol. I literally laughed aloud. Please don't make me do that in the same movie whereby a corpse gets special bed treatment. Editing, dialogue, and direction ruined the experience for me.

But as we learned this was just a normal man living in the walls and the camera was pointing directly at the bedroom door as we saw her run inside and close the door, so wouldn't the camera have picked up the man moving the book case to and from the door way?.

This is all quickly forgotten though because the story is amazing in my opinion its execution is delightful with balanced characters, no cliche scenes, unexpected turns, good dialogue, characters with believable stories to tell, the horror is smart as well one second I think it's a ghost then the second I think it's a real home intruder. The jump scares actually worked on me most of them anyway and the performances by all the actors were pretty good for what I was expecting!

Hollywood is recycling ideas and entire movies lately, so what can we really expect...I thought it was a solid cast and good acting. I have to agree that the added agenda of white supremacy and ""it wasn't like a white man died"" attitude were unnecessary and only serve to propagate the already tense social atmosphere of the world today. On the contrary, I really appreciated that the main characters were working through their infidelity issue instead of just calling it quits, as so many do today. That was refreshing. I read one review that said they hated the film the moment the sister said it was OK to cheat because Nat's needs weren't being met. I think that viewer missed the point that the film was trying to advocate against that justification.The only element of the film that really troubled me was the nature of Otto. There were so many ways he was made to seem like a ghost - like appearing inside a closet when he was previously outside of it, appearing inside a locked bedroom after being in the hallway, and not to mention how he managed to retrieve the tennis ball from under the bed and place it on top all in a matter of seconds while Nat grabbed a broomstick. There were never any other passageways revealed in the house other than the downstairs closet. In the end, it was seemingly made clear he was a real person (who was evidently replacing his Erin-obsession with whoever the next female occupant would be), and that Nat and Kevin killed him. This is why it was SO HARD for me to accept the closet door shutting on its own in the closing scene. If he's dead, and it wasn't a ghost, how the hell can this story have a circle-ending?! That... was a poor writing choice, not a plot hole like the rest of the issues I take with the film.Still a worthwhile watch for horror-lovers such as myself. Just don't expect brilliance. :)",Aftermath

Featuring a gaslighting husband, cheating wife and black sheep sister ( who ""disappears"" and no one bats an eye). Dialogue is forced and unrealistic, the only one I was rooting for was the dog.The movie starts by giving the old supernatural vibe, only for the villain to be a guy living in the attic... who also happens to be a ninja, avoids the cctv and moves at the speed of light ( also named Otto- see above True Crime story which is far more interesting than this one).I was looking forward to watching it based on the description but it left me with bad taste in my mouth and the need to read up on the true stories as I knew I'd heard this story before.

I think the dog genuinely wanted out of this film and killed itself.As for the acting. Well there was an over abundance of it. Ive never seen someone actually acting to put across that they are doing nothing. Everyone had exceptional hair. Waking from a long sleep, lip gloss on and hair sitting perfect.

No one cares about the sister disappearing??2. Why if the CCTV system was pointing at Natalie's room door, when the basement dude blocks it with a bookshelf, is not captured? And we just see her?3. If Erin kept this guy locked in the basement, why didn't he get out of there after she died? Or scream for some help when Kevin was cleaning the house at the beginning?? Uuhhh??4. Where did that guy got the poison and a syringe from? Did he order it on Amazon? Can he even speak? Oh wait! He is a technology master!5. Again, they find the sister DEAD and no one even mentions it? Or cry about it? Or just acknowledge it?6. They had to put their puppy down and they bought one straight away? No mourning??. Which leads me again to NO ONE MOURNS THE SISTER EITHER!!!7. In the final scene the door and handle of the basement door moving... does it mean that there actually IS a ghost on the house like they make us think at the beginning??

Why exactly did the seller's husband want them out of the house? They made it clear they had not had any prospective offers for the home, so what kind of money did he think he could get from being the homeowner/landlord? The wife's strained relationship with her mother added nothing to the movie.Also.. if all this creepy stuff in the house was not paranormal and it was just the greasy man living in the walls, why would he not have appeared on the CCTV footage in the house? What was the point in turning the temp down to 30 degrees and why did he have the ability to do that within the walls? And why did the wife decide to turn the temp down to 30 degrees when she was escaping the room?Now to Dani. Honestly... I think her acting scene was decent. Why would greasy man murder her? She was standing right by the front door and decided to run back upstairs to grab her cell phone? That would not happen. Also her sister made it clear she has a drug problem especially when their mother is in town and they she goes radio silent and nobody is looking for her?

330,oudameinfo,Such. Bad. Writing.,3,5 November 2021,"I created an IMDB acct just to comment on this movie :) this monstrosity has to be the byproduct of a Lifetime channel TV writer getting an opportunity to write an edgy paranormal mystery thriller. Deep breath. I'll give my top reasons why this movie is ridiculously bad. Watch it only if you want to laugh at bad writing or have the ability to suspend belief beyond normal levels.#1 A struggling couple buys a million dollar home. Ha! Ok, I'll let this one slide. I'll pretend that this story takes place pre-covid and home sales were slumping somewhere in the U. S. . There was a murder in the house I guess (but apparently there were no investors or house flipper in that entire state). Cherry on top when the husband makes his absolute highest offer and the owners counter with ""sure why not just throw in an extra $20K"" and they all burst into celebration. Um, What? Did the writer forget that the wife is a struggling designer that hasn't even got paid for her new job and the husband does hazmat clean up?#2 The wife's sister is incredibly annoying. I'm ashamed to say I'm glad she found her demise. The character was unconscionably a disgusting human being who encouraged her sisters infidelity despite her brother-in-law losing his brother in passing. Crap-Sis reminded big-sis ""your needs weren't being met so you shouldn't feel remorse"". Wow. Wow. Bye lady. Next stop becoming a reincarnated cockroach.#3 Both the characters display examples of extreme amounts of poor judgment. I found it difficult to have any empathy surrounding their situation and relationship struggles. *Rubs hands together feverishly* this rotting watermelon is getting juicier by the minute.#4 To summarize the movie's conclusion... a mentally handicapped side-piece lived under a house for months, surviving off no food, with a homeless digital command center to monitor everything, and somehow had access to medical grade anesthesia and needles, was hell bent on killing everyone without prejudice because he was heart-broken.... Lmfao.This story has so many holes in it and is built on such a ridiculously premise I honestly found it to be hysterical. I ruined a few moments for my girlfriend because my uncontrollable laughter was shaking the bed.The production quality was okay but this belongs on the lifestyle or Hallmark channel not Netflix.I'm embarrassed to say this was my second viewing.My girlfriend fell asleep the first time we watched it.

342,suze74,Not what I expected.,8,14 August 2021,Inspired by true events. Don't know how much of the inspiration is fact or fiction but the plot twists and turns where I didn't expect to go and when It starts to unravel and the juicy details come to light more than once did I jump in my seat. I think maybe they should've lived in a caravan would've been safer.,Aftermath
343,mflatt27,Well worth watching,7,23 September 2021,"Yes, it has a bit of that formula plot line haunted house storyline, but it is well acted and has a good plot twist. Not sure why other low ratings.",Aftermath
344,sozu-nova-frozu,Nothing special at all,2,4 August 2021,Lacked anything new to the story than movies that are already there just like this.,Aftermath
345,drrobinberry,2 hours I can't get back,1,26 August 2021,What? Bad! 2 hours I can't get back. I've never written a review before but felt compelled to warn others not to waste your time!,Aftermath
346,adawaykaren,Boring and confused!,1,11 August 2021,"The movie had a few good moments, not many but a few...however, the ending was absolutely terrible. It made no sense to me at all, and I've watched hundreds of horror, thriller, scary movies. The way the writer chose to end the story was just terrible. Did he just run out of ideas for an ending? So was the ""Lover"" crazy at the end and that's why he chose to live in the walls?I'm just so confused!",Aftermath
347,srobb-76414,Not a single original idea in the film,3,6 August 2021,"Unfortunately this film just gets worse and worse at is goes on. The directing, writing, and acting all take a significant dive in the last 45 minutes. There are obviously huge scenes that were cut, making the ""reveal"" nonsensical. And yet, boring and entirely unnecessary scenes with ex lovers and family members somehow made the final edit?This film could have been a good hate-watch for all the tropes it covers, but simply goes on for too long to make it worth the while.",Aftermath
348,katyritab,Horrible,2,14 August 2021,Felt like it was just a bunch of random scenes slapped together.,Aftermath
349,betsyellington,Best scary movie I've seen in a long time!!,8,8 August 2021,"Loved this....very entertaining, was so scared through the whole
movie!",Aftermath
350,rkhussey,Editing... Ugh,6,5 August 2021,"What's with the editing here. She's wearing a robe, then a black shirt, then back to a robe. That kind is stuff irks me to no end. Otherwise the movie was okay.",Aftermath
351,sharanhans,Not too bad. Surprised at the bad reviews,9,4 August 2021,"Expected the climax at one point, but quite engaging till the end.",Aftermath
352,mgdman,"Really, Netflix?",3,18 September 2021,"I actually thought that the acting wasn't half bad for such a lazy, unoriginal movie. Not that it could save the movie.",Aftermath
353,bonnieglass,Predictable,4,6 August 2021,Waist of space. Over acted & poor plot. Nothing to see here.,Aftermath
