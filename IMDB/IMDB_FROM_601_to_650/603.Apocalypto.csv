0,MartinHafer,"Exceptionally tough to watch due to its violence, but also almost impossible to stop watching",9,3 November 2007,"The film, believe it or not, is shot entirely with subtitles--using what was purported to be a recreation of a Mayan-type tongue for the film to heighten its realism (though the exact language has been lost). Considering the film was set just before first contact with the Western world, this was a daring but intelligent choice.The story involves a group of men who are captured and taken to the Mayan capital to be sacrificed. As crops have failed, there is drought and a plague has struck, the Maya are looking to appease their god, Kukulcan (like the Aztec Quetzelcoatl--a dragon capable of swallowing the Earth is he isn't pleased). With scenes involving the sacrifices, the piles of what seem like thousands of bodies and the very violent deaths later in the film, this is definitely NOT a film for sensitive viewers or kids. In fact, I was surprised that this film received only an R-rating, as the violence and carnage was among the most graphic I have ever seen on film and it probably would have been best to rate it NC-17--it's THAT intensely violent and disturbing. These portions of the film are akin to full-color Holocaust footage.So if the film is SO violent and tough to watch, why did I actually enjoy it? Well, first, I am a history teacher and was amazed at the wonderful attempt to re-create the barbarity of the Mayans as well as the helplessness of the neighboring tribes. Unlike the happy, Earth-loving stereotype we've recently envisioned of the Native Americans, the Maya and Aztecs were truly brutal and blood-thirsty civilizations--responsible for massive ethnic cleansing of smaller tribes through human sacrifice and slavery. While the Conquistadors were awful and greedy (as well as over-idealized in films like CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE), it's awfully tough to feel sorry for these two groups of natives and I am sure nearby tribes also were thrilled to see these cultures destroyed (despite all their pretty cities). It was nice to see the sacrifices ultimately stopped--though they were unfortunately replaced with Spanish genocide and slavery--I guess you can't win 'em all.Second, even though the film was brutal, the last half of the movie was about the most exciting and tense I have ever seen on film. The prolonged chase scene was brilliantly executed and I simply couldn't stop watching since it captivated me. In many ways it was like prolonging the chase scene from THE FRENCH CONNECTION to an hour instead of 10 minutes! Sure, it was super-violent but at the same time it was super-skilled in its execution and I barely breathed during many of the tensest moments.So, if you can get past all the gore, then this is a truly amazing and unique film--one you can never forget and one that raises realism to a shocking level. The only reason it didn't earn a 10 from me is that, at times, the realism DIDN'T need to be THAT real and the film just goes to realistic excess.2/8/08--I just finished watching Cornel Wilde in THE NAKED PREY (1966) and found the plot to be very, very close to Apocalypto--so much so that it seems this latter film is actually a reworking of THE NAKED PREY (which it is also better than, but both films are indeed excellent).",Apocalypto
1,Leofwine_draca,An all-time favourite adventure film,10,3 July 2015,"While I enjoyed Mel Gibson's last historical epic, Passion of the Christ, I found it a bit lacking in heart. The focus was on viscera and the downbeat story was just too tough to enjoy. When I heard his latest movie was an action adventure about the ancient Mayans, I was pumped and pretty sure I'd enjoy it.I did. APOCALYPTO neatly blends the type of skillful direction we've come to expect from the director with an action-film template that never disappoints. It's Gibson's best film as director, beautifully shot throughout with some stunning jungle locations, an epic and awe-inspiring Mayan city that will take your breath away, and the best waterfall scene I've seen in a film. The cast of unknowns are entirely remarkable, each and every one one of them, and it's amazing how the viewer can empathise with them from the very first scene, despite the facts that their characters are little more than jungle savages who speak in an unknown tongue.The film follows the journey of Jaguar Paw, the excellent young hero, who's taken as a slave to a Mayan city where blood sacrifice is the norm. Through his eyes, we see hundreds of remarkable sights that I'll have fun watching again and again. The latter part of the film is more straightforward, and my favourite bit: it's essentially a re-run of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, as our lone, wounded hero attempts to flee a gang of well-armed hunters. The bad guys end up getting picked off one by one in increasingly satisfying ways, pretty much like something out of a horror film.Gibson goes all-out with the bloodshed from the very beginning. Severed heads, entrails, torn hearts, headless corpses, rotting fields of the dead, axe wounds to the skull, and death by jaguar are just some of what's in store, and it's all handled very well indeed. Laced throughout with genuine humour and wonderfully pulse-pounding excitement, I loved every minute of APOCALYPTO despite the lengthy running time and I recommend it wholeheartedly to everybody.",Apocalypto
2,SnoopyStyle,harrowing story,8,23 December 2015,"Jaguar Paw leads a hunting party in the jungle with his father. They encounter refugees escaping from an unknown danger. Their unprepared village is attacked by a Mayan hunting party. Most of the adults are enslaved and brought to the city. The land is suffering from drought and plague. The male prisoners are being sacrificed. There is a solar eclipse just as Jaguar Paw is about to be sacrificed. The men are given an opportunity to run for their freedom. When Jaguar Paw escapes, the Mayan warrior leads a chase to avenge his son who is killed by Jaguar Paw.The first half of this movie is absolutely harrowing and brutal. It is powerfully shot by director Mel Gibson. The little kids are heart-breaking. His escape and journey has a few too many coincidences. I buy the jaguar as some kind of prophetic sign just like the solar eclipse. However, he doesn't need to rescue his wife and kid just in the nick of time. The final image also doesn't need to be that. It seems to suggest something that isn't quite warranted. All in all, it can't be denied that this is wonderful filmmaking.",Apocalypto
3,Horst_In_Translation,The Passion of the Mayan,6,23 September 2015,"""Apocalypto"" is a film that 2-time Academy Award winner Mel Gibson wrote and directed almost 10 years ago and it was his follow-up project (apart from a quick excursion to television) to ""The Passion of the Christ"". There are certainly some similarities between these 2 films. Gibson does not act in either, the language they are speaking is a thing of the past and we watch basically one man suffer for a huge part of the film.However, ""Apocalypto"" has a more uplifting, even if predictable, storyline. The Mayan Jaguar Paw manages to break free from his captors and almost the entire second half of the film is basically how they keep chasing him through the jungle with his enemies dying one by one. Meanwhile, his pregnant wife and child are waiting for him. It's all a bit generic, all a bit predictable, so the story is okay, but not the highlight of the film. Neither is the acting and this is another parallel to Gibson's previous project.The best thing from ""Apocalypto"" is, without a doubt"" the visual side. It's a beautiful film with all the nature and landscapes included. Good to see the film was honored by the Academy with 3 nominations, even if the makeup one is a bit uninspiring. I am not the greatest fan of Mel Gibson as a filmmaker, more of him as an actor, but these almost 140 minutes are a decent overall achievement. Recommended.",Apocalypto
4,claudio_carvalho,Non-Stop Brutal Action,8,19 August 2007,"In the Maya civilization, a peaceful tribe is brutally attacked by warriors seeking slaves and human beings for sacrifice for their gods. Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) hides his pregnant wife and his son in a deep hole nearby their tribe and is captured while fighting with his people. An eclipse spares his life from the sacrifice and later he has to fight to survive and save his beloved family.""Apocalypto"" is the journey of a hero that recalls ""Rambo"" or John ""Die Hard"" McClane with his great ability to survive in the jungle. The story is extremely brutal and has non-stop action, and it seems that it is spoken in the ancient Maya language. I do not see any further objective other than marketing call the use of a dead language in a movie, since no viewer is able to understand or judge how accurate it might be. But the screenplay is engaging and the camera work is excellent. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Apocalypto""",Apocalypto
5,classicsoncall,"""Beware the man who brings the jaguar.""",10,19 August 2018,"Whether intentional or inadvertent, what director Mel Gibson did here was cast a light on the true history of the world in microcosm, that civilizations rise and fall via the aggressive use of force. And that leaders of warrior tribes rely on fear, courage, power and the threat of death to maintain their supremacy, not only at the top of their own hierarchy, but in the conquest of weaker tribes. A little superstition goes a long way too, as in taking advantage of an unexpected eclipse of the sun to silence and cast terror into the masses. Not to mention a literal translation of an implicit threat that heads will roll. Gibson brings a unique vision to the screen with this jungle drama, unlike most any other picture one is likely to imagine. With a cast of unknowns, he tells a story of unrelenting violence and a deep commitment held by his principal character to escape from his captors and return to his family and freedom. What kept me occupied throughout most of the picture was how Gibson and his film crew managed to capture all of the action and drama that unfolded and make it look as seamless as it did. The film ends with the irony that this civilization too will eventually come to an end with the appearance of the Conquistadors.",Apocalypto
6,jboothmillard,Apocalypto,8,6 March 2009,"I saw the trailer for this film in the cinema, and it is only when it appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die that I was certain I wanted to see it, from director Mel Gibson. The film is set in the mysterious Mayan kingdom - pre-Spanish Mexico, where a tribe live in the jungles. Their peaceful life is interrupted by the attack of a band of Mayan soldiers who kidnap many of them, and tied to bamboo poles, forced to walk through perilous terrain to reach their civilisation, forced to become slaves. The protagonist Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), one of the captured, manages to escape, and the soldiers chase him through a corn field, over waterfalls and through the jungle, as he gets back to his pregnant wife and son who he left behind hiding in a hole. Also starring Dalia Hernández as Seven, Jonathan Brewer as Blunted, Morris Birdyellowhead as Flint Sky, Carlos Emilio Báez as Turtles Run, Amilcar Ramírez as Curl Nose, Israel Contreras as Smoke Frog, Israel Ríos as Cocoa Leaf, Gerardo Taracena as Middle Eye and Raoul Trujillo as Zero Wolf. The Passion of the Christ was pretty gory, but compared to this it has some very inventive moments, it has exciting chase sequences, and even with subtitled Yucatan dialogue (a language I've never heard of) a very compelling story. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Makeup, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!",Apocalypto
7,Tweekums,Mad Mel's Mayan epic,9,15 February 2010,"Mad Mel's venture into the world of pre-conquest Mayans certainly isn't for the squeamish; it opens with a group of hunters killing and butchering a tapir then after a brief interlude where we are introduced the the hunters and their tribe the violence between the jungle hunters and the raiding party which has come to their area to capture people who are to be taken to the city to be sacrificed. If you are not squeamish however and like an adrenalin pumping action thriller with no obvious CGI in site then this is the film for you.After the initial killing of the tapir the hunting party are seen joking together, mostly at the expense of one of them who has yet to father a child, their joking stops when another group passes by telling them that their village has been ravaged. The hunters then return home to their own idyllic village. The peace is soon shattered when a large group of warriors attack the village and capture most of the adult population. Jaguar Paw, one of the hunters, manages to hide his pregnant wife and child in a well and almost kills Middle Eye, one of the raiding party. The leader of the warriors, Zero Wolf puts an end to the fight and won't let Middle Eye kill Jaguar, he doesn't stop him killing his father though. Tied together the villagers are taken out of the jungle to a city where the crops have failed and the people are suffering from a sickness. It is here that the reason for their capture becomes apparent; they are to be brutally sacrificed to appease the sun god Kukulkan. During the proceedings there is a solar eclipse and the priest announces that this is clearly a sign that Kukulkan has had enough blood. This doesn't mean freedom for Jaguar Paw and his compatriots though, they are taken off to be used for target practice. Jaguar Paw is wounded but when Zero Wolf approaches to dispatch him he uses the arrow tip to kill him before fleeing back to the jungle. With his son dead Zero Wolf is determined to be avenged and pursues Jaguar Paw into the jungle where his men are picked off one by one, either by nature or by Jaguar Paw himself. As their chase continues a storm begins so Jaguar Paw must get back to his village to rescue his wife and child from the well before they drown. The chase ends on a beach where the last two of the warriors are so shocked by the sight of Spanish ships that they stand transfixed while Jaguar Paw goes back and saves his wife. As the film ends they head into the jungle to start their lives anew.The cast of mostly unknown actors did a great job especially Rudy Youngblood who played Jaguar Paw, he was in just about every scene and for most of the film was either running for his life or tied to a pole as he was led through the jungle. I wasn't surprised to find that Raoul Trujillo who plays Zero Wolf has a string of acting credits to his name as he brought a real presence to the role. The idea of making a Hollywood blockbuster in Mayan sounds insane but it really worked, the people wouldn't have felt half as real if they'd been speaking English. It was also great that there wasn't any obvious CGI involved, action films are always more exciting if it looks like people are actually doing the stunts we see. The ending is slightly ambiguous, are the Spaniards the rescuers who will rid the world of an evil regime or to they just herald the arrival of a new oppressor? I personally think it was intended as the latter.",Apocalypto
8,moonspinner55,Gibson's (gory) total eclipse of the heart...,6,3 November 2007,"Innocent Mayan village in ancient times is attacked one morning by a sadistic tribe from the city; the men and women who survive are taken prisoner, with the women being sold off at auction and the men lined up to give their lives for a horrific human sacrifice. One Mayan hunter called Jaguar Paw, who has hidden his wife and child out of harm's way, focuses on his inner-strength and determination and breaks free of his captors. Director/co-writer Mel Gibson's work is technically proficient, yet he's only about the ""big"" moments; the chases through the jungle and the tangling with mortal enemies brings out the best in him (despite the annoying over-usage of slow-motion photography), yet Gibson's narrative collapses every now and again from incoherency. He isn't helped by the editing, which leaves minor details out of the mix, and smaller scenes which are treated with significance but do not have a great deal of perception behind them (such as the falling tree nearly hitting the prisoners, a sick child seemingly possessed by a spirit, and a waterfall jump that equates leaping hundreds of feet into a rocky river to just another hurdle for hardened men). Indeed, Gibson is full of machismo, which is probably what interested him in this project from the start; he enjoys a manly conflict with characters who are defined as good or evil simply by the company they keep. He has a sentimental side as well, but much of the focus is on man's inhumanity to man, with bloody, almost incomprehensible scenes of torture. It's isn't for the faint of heart, but it is undeniably well-acted, engrossing and quick on its feet. *** from ****",Apocalypto
9,paul_haakonsen,"Great, simply great...",8,27 December 2015,"Don't get deterred by the 139 minutes length of the movie. ""Apocalypto"" is great entertainment from the very beginning to the very end. And director Mel Gibson has truly put together a unique and memorable movie with ""Apocalypto"".The story is about a village of tribesmen being taken captive, brought through the dense jungle to a massive town of stone and mortar. Here they are to be sacrificed to please the ancient gods. But young Jaguar Paw escapes captivity and races across the jungle to get back to his pregnant wife. But his captors does not let their quarry escape imprisonment and set in hot pursuit.What makes ""Apocalypto"" work so well is the atmosphere and the untainted jungle, along with the cinematography. Everything just works so well with one another like pieces in a puzzle. And I especially liked the gritty feel of the characters, such as the teeth. It would have been such an epic fail if they had pearly White and perfectly aligned teeth.""Apocalypto"" is one of those movies that grabs you by the you-know-whats and doesn't let you go before after 139 minutes. And the ride you will be taken on is an adrenaline-filled one, and with a story that sinks right in.It is also the type of movie that can be watched more than once. This was my third time watching it, in fact.",Apocalypto
10,Quinoa1984,"wow- Mel, you have done it again, only worse this time, much worse",1,14 December 2006,"Apocalypto is not just a bad movie in my book, but one of the most frustrating ones in recent memory, certainly in the past decade. It has no real point, no clear message, aside from an extremely contrived one, and concerns itself with being an over-the-top gore-fest in the guise of a allegorical journey about survival. It's staggering to think the same man directed Braveheart. Now, more than ten years later, and after going through the Passion of the Christ, something tells me there's a Troma director or missing sci-fi movie channel gun-for-hire deep inside Gibson's consciousness. Meaning that if you find some of what happens, actually a lot, laughable in a bad-movie way, you're not alone. So what is there to say about the worst movie I've seen this year? For starters, that it actually does carry the weight of potential, a lot of potential. A director coming off of one of the most financially successful films of all time in the US gets carte-blanche to make whatever he wants and decides to go to a place and time not too many people have seen in the movies, the world of the Mayan civilization. He injects in it a tale of one man's quest to escape the bounds of execution to get back to his very pregnant wife and child, whom he hid from sight in a cave while his tribe was being destroyed. Right from the start I should've known what I would be getting into, just from the first shot that mimics the opening of Apocalypse Now (feet instead of helicopters, so fresh), and with the general impression that the tribes-people don't do much aside from making fun of one man who has problems with his genitals. Enter the savage section of the Mayans, who kill quite a few of the tribe before enslaving the lot of them, particularly the ""hero"" Jaguar Paw.The one thing I could give Gibson in part, at least at first, was that unlike the Passion of the Christ, it didn't seem boring from the outset and then all the way through. In fact, some of the early scenes in the first half hour-forty five minutes carry a little promise. But then in Gibson's disregard for an audience's intelligence he just wields contrivance after contrivance meant to be seen as something otherworldly and important and majestic. Not so; for all the epic virtuosity that Gibson means to make it all adds up to just frustration. It's not exciting to see much at all of the action and slaying and bloodshed in Apocalypto, it's just, well, there really (as in said Troma movie, only there at least they sort of acknowledge that what they're doing is crap). As Jaguar Paw runs through the jungle evading his captors- and then practically becoming MacGuyver in figuring out ways of knocking them out. On top of this, Gibson cuts back and forth between the chase and the pregnant wife and child in the cave, and the little inanities that keep happening (they kill a wild monkey that falls in, the mother slips and falls while trying to escape), but all don't match up to what happens when she finally has the baby, as it's birthed in water no less (a downpour immediately following one of Jaguar's slayings), and then the wife just gets right out of the cave after popping out a baby in a few minutes.But none of the head-scratching, what-the-hell moments match up to that moment on the beach. I mean, is Gibson trying to lay in a thicker message about all of this? Just in terms of the look of them, they're totally out of place and don't seem like they're in the same film. But chiefly, before the conquistadors arrive, one could take the time period as being anytime (even with the 'eclipse' that comes right before Jaguar Paw's possible sacrifice). When they arrive, it's a really inane move that tries to bring a lot more to ponder that just does not work, at all. And indeed this comes after an entire film that does several things to a viewer, or rather to me. It makes the case, for one thing, that digital-video is not always a good thing in hands like Gibson's, who decides to use it like he's having a seizure or epilepsy (see the jungle scenes and you'll know what I mean). For all the grandiosity that Gibson attempts with the BIG sequences, it comes out poor and haphazard.And by the way, Gibson means for this all to be taken seriously, 100% so. There's not a drop of intentional humor to be found, even when he means to with the early scenes in the tribe. The delirious attitudes of the characters, especially the ""hero"" in particular who becomes an invincible force who somehow can't be killed not by logical reasons but by firm, stupidly placed circumstances in the script, are staggering. But more than anything, Gibson never gives the slightest hint of subtlety, or of a real purpose behind the story and environment he's dealing with. It's all bludgeoning on the head, as if we wouldn't get it after a while. Not that I don't like some films or directors who go over the edge and try to take the audience with them. However Gibson's idea of going over the edge is almost to punish the audience with idiotically one-dimensional characters, cinematography and editing I'd expect from somewhat higher-budgeted sideshow horror movie geeks, and those final lines of dialog had my head about to explode.",Apocalypto
11,tavm,Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is compelling historical drama,7,12 December 2006,"Having heard that the violence in Apocalypto was graphic and relentless, I was prepared for a thrill ride. While much of it was indeed thrilling, it was also fascinating to see how the community of Maya lived somewhat peacefully before being invaded to go into slave labor at temples where many get sacrificed to the gods. One of these Mayans, Jaguar Paw, provides the heart of the story: his attempt to go back to his pregnant wife and kid whom he left down a hole in the ground in order to keep his captors from killing them. As he had done with Braveheart, director Mel Gibson depicts many beheadings and ripping of hearts in order to show how intense battling for your life really is. In doing so, he's made another compelling world that takes you where you've never been before. While I admit to sleeping partway through this, I managed to be awake through some of the most graphic scenes such as when a jaguar ate someone's head. My favorite scenes were near the end when, during a storm, the pregnant woman induced her pregnancy while water was flooding around her in the ground hole. So, for lovers of Mel Gibson and historical drama, I highly recommend Apocalypto.",Apocalypto
12,Coventry,It's the end of the Maya-World as we know it,10,12 March 2007,"If ""Apocalypto"" only taught us ONE thing, it's that Mel Gibson is one of the last truly dedicated and perfectionist filmmakers active in Hollywood these days. In an era where all the other directors revert to digital effects and other computer-engineered toys to re-create even the smallest details in scenery, Gibson actually took the time and effort to rebuild the entire and carefully detailed Maya-metropolis as well as complete tribal villages and contemporary hunting equipment. In other words, this is cinema at his purest! And does it ever work! ""Apocalypto"" is much more realistic and visually overwhelming than any other large-scaled epic production that came out recently. When the protagonists enter the empire of the Maya-priests, it feels like history comes to life in front of your eyes and it's literally breathtaking. The downright brilliant sets and scenery alone cause me to refer to Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" as one of the greatest movies of the year 2006, and then I still haven't mentioned a thing about the story and the acting performances. The screenplay is neatly divided into two main chapters and, it has to be said, the first half isn't that impressive. Entirely filmed in the gigantic Mexican rain forest, Gibson introduces us to the members of a small native community and extendedly portrays how they live, hunt and celebrate in harmony. The men supply the village with food while the women are exclusively occupied with giving birth to new descendants and looking after the children. Their peaceful lives abruptly come to end when the warriors of another Maya-tribe savagely invade the village. The adult men and women are enslaved and taken for an exhausting journey across the jungle, while the children are abandoned at a river. Jaguar Paw manages to entrench his pregnant wife and son in a pit and promises them to return. Arriving in the aforementioned metropolis, the majority of villagers are sacrificed to the Sun Gods, but Jaguar Paw miraculously escapes this merciless fate. Then for the second half, Mel Gibson turns his script around into a tremendously entertaining B-popcorn movie with the most amazingly choreographed and adrenalin-rushing jungle chase ever depicted. Relentlessly pursued by a handful of bloodthirsty Maya-warriors, Jaguar Paw runs home through the jungle like crazy and defeats his enemies one by one, using his knowledge of the area as well as his trained hunting skills. The first half of ""Apocalypto"" is a visual masterpiece but slightly dull and implausible. According to news articles I've read, the events also aren't illustrated accurately since Mel Gibson uses too many metaphors that refer to nowadays politics and social issues. I can't really judge on that, but it remains an undeniable fact that ""Apocalypto"" is must-see if only for the copious amounts of spectacle and excitement it delivers. This is a much better film than ""Passion of the Christ"" and at least a dozen times less pretentious. Of course, you require a strong stomach and nerve system, as Mel Gibson portrays the physical battles and torture sequences really graphically and without leaving anything to the imagination. This means that, for example, when a wild jaguar attacks someone, it really shows you how the animal devours his whole face, complete with uncanny grinding noises and buckets of bloodshed. The acting performances are more than adequate, especially considering most of the cast members never had cameras aimed at them, and Gibson's direction is constantly resolute. Highly recommended viewing; whether you're a fan of raw exploitation or large-budgeted epics, ""Apocalypto"" is a cinematic experience you can't afford yourself to miss.",Apocalypto

14,sunwarrior13,"""Crucifixion"" Of The Early Mayans",9,17 November 2011,"Apocalypto is a an epic action-adventure film co-written and directed by Mel Gibson. The story was set at Yucatan, Mexico during the declining period of the Maya civilization as it depicts the journey of a Mesoamerican tribesman who must escape human sacrifice and rescue his family after the capture and destruction of his village.It stars Rudy Youngblood and Dalia Hernandez together with Raoul Trujillo,Mayra Sérbulo,Gerardo Taracena,Rodolfo Palacios,Bernardo Ruiz Juarez,Ammel Rodrigo Mendoza,Ricardo Diaz Mendoza and Israel Contreras.The film features a cast of Mayas, and some other people of Native American descent. Inspired by such ancient Mayan texts as the Popul Vuh, Apocalypto marks a comprehensive collaboration between director Gibson and Cambridge-educated co-screenwriter Farhad Safinia, and world- renowned archaeologist and Mayan culture expert Dr. Richard D. Hansen,whose whose services as a special consultant on the film lent the production an unprecedented degree of historical accuracy.The story of Apocalypto is starts as the foundation of the Mayan civilization begins to crumble.One man's previously idyllic existence is forever changed when he is chosen as a sacrifice needed to appease the gods. The Mayan kingdom is at the absolute height of opulence and power, but leaders are convinced that unless more temples are constructed and more human sacrifices made, the crops, and ultimately the people, will suffer. Jaguar Paw is a peaceful hunter from a remote forest tribe whose life is about to be changed forever. When Jaguar Paw's village is raided and he is prepared as a sacrifice that the Mayan deities have demanded, the brave young hunter is forced to navigate a horrific new world of fear and oppression. Fearlessly determined to escape his captors and save his family from a harrowing demise, Jaguar Paw prepares to risk it all in one final, desperate attempt to preserve his dying way of life. However, few who have seen the sacrificial alter of the Mayans have managed to live to see another day. Now, in order to rescue his pregnant wife and young son, Jaguar Paw will have to elude the most powerful warriors of the Mayan kingdom while using his vast knowledge of the forest to turn the tables on those who would rather see him dead than set free.The movie was set to be a view of the Mayan civilization.But the last part of the movie turned out to be a commercial viability for great action scenes and entertainment.What turned out to be a character study as well as a perspective into how the early Mayans lived turned out to be a brilliant movie in visceral violence.It works well on the action genre as it loses perspective onto becoming a historical drama.In summary,Apocalypto is Mel Gibson's ""crucifixion"" version of the early Mayan people.",Apocalypto

17,hitchcockthelegend,Savagery abound in oddly entertaining ACTION film.,9,4 March 2008,"I'll start right off and say I practically loved this film, but let me state that I loved it for none of the reasons I was expecting I would, prior to the viewing. Upon loading the disc I was prepared for over two hours of deep cranial work taking in the destruction of the Mayan civilisation, perhaps an insightful look at this particular race of people and how they lived? What I got was actually one of the best action movies of the 00s!Looking at the ream of reviews here and viewing all the threads across this particular site it is evident that I was not on my own in being torpedoed as to how the film panned out, was it Mel Gibson's intention from the off to do a straight action piece in subtitles ?, perhaps he started off to do a deep thinker but quickly realised that he could make a top dollar actioner instead? Either way this film delivers royally to those who get much from the action genre itself, and thankfully I count myself amongst that number.Mel Gibson ups the violence quotient here, perhaps not quite for violence sake, but very nearly because it's part of a story that uses every cliché in the action film book, in essence the film is a simple chase/revenge plot piece, only here the added gimmick of a civilisation long past puts a bit more weight on the freshly stripped of skin bones. What lifts this film above your standard genre pieces tho is the great work Gibson does with his camera, he knows his money shots, he can frame a breathtaking scene very well indeed, and he manages to get tremendous performances from a largely unknown (and some never worked before) cast.It's a pulse pounding thrilling movie with splendid dashes of humour, whilst it's also a gore hounds dream, and sure enough there are metaphors there if you are so inclined to look for them, and if you like playing spot the homage (or lift?), then fill your boots because they are all in here too. Ultimately if you are looking for a deep historical epic then you need to look elsewhere, but if you want a bold as brass action piece then get in the queue and enjoy the ride. 9/10",Apocalypto
18,Theo Robertson,"Violent , Compelling And That's Before The Real Bad Guys Turn Up At The End",8,17 March 2013,"Who'd have ever thought a film with Amaraic dialogue featuring little more than some Jewish bloke getting tortured to death for two hours would be such a commercial and critical hit with a mainstream audience . To give Mel Gibson some credit he did manage to pull off the least likely cinema hit in decades with his Biblical torture porn movie , though much of its success was simply down to its controversy . Let's not forget that Gibson is very much a man of controversy and he did a sort of real life sequel to his biblical movie with a LA cop . What better publicity for an upcoming release featuring yet another film featuring graphic violence with not one single word of English dialogue spoken throughout the running time ? You still have to give Gibson great credit with APOCALYPTO . No big names , no English dialogue and little in the way of intricate plotting . Instead we have a chase movie that's a little bit different and owes a massive debt to the 1966 Cornell Wilde movie THE NAKED PREY . There is a massive cultural gap between 1966 and 2006 and it shows . While you might believe the Wilde film does pull its punches in its portrayal of violence certainly nothing is held back in APOCALYPTO . One day a Mayan tribe are having a brew enjoying the effect of the maninkari world , then the next morning they're waking up to find a rival tribe smashing their heads in and dragging them away to be either sacrificed or sold in to sexual slaveryYes let's be cynical because much of the selling point of the movie is the graphic blood thirsty violent tone of the film but it is genuinely compelling as the audience watch a classic three act structure of the tribe being introduced , their capture and brutal nihilistic journey to their captors lair and "" Almost"" escaping with a posse in hot pursuit . Their is something slightly contrived about the third act the way weapons such as a bee hive conveniently find their-selves in the path of Almost but it's never done in such a contrived manner that you notice it on first viewing and certainly I never thought I was watching an episode of MCGUYVER set in a Mayan jungle As for the ending if APOCALYPTO had another director then you'd probably be entitled to think Almost and his tribe and indeed the entire Mayan culture were having a really rotten time until these nice Spanish Christians turned up . Since it's Mel Gibson who has well known and relatively infamous views on fundamental Catholicism that's almost certainly the point he is trying to make which renders the rest of the film bitterly ironic in retrospect when the ending would have been far more ambiguous . If the Mayan culture was so brutal then secularism would be a good idea but the historical truth is that in those days if you were going to get invaded it was always by a more technologically advanced power with its own religious agenda which enforced it at gunpoint and brought diseases like smallpox in its wake . What a pity germ theory , vaccines and anti-theists like Dawkins and Hitchens weren't around in the 16th Century",Apocalypto
19,poolandrews,A great film.,7,22 April 2011,"Apocalypto is set in the 16th Century jungles of South America where a small peaceful Mayan tribe lives, the tribe is suddenly attacked by by another & many are either killed or taken prisoner. A young warrior named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) manages to lower his pregnant wife & young son into a deep hole to keep them out of sight but he too is captured & taken prisoner leaving his family stuck down the hole. Jaguar Paw & his fellow captives are taken to a great Mayan city that is in rapid decline, a terrible sickness is infecting & killing the human population while the cities crops also fail to grow & die because of disease. The rulers of the city offer up human sacrifices for their Gods, Jaguar paw & his tribe are to become such sacrifices but Jaguar paw himself is miraculously saved by a solar eclipse. Managing to escape the city Jaguar Paw heads home to save his family but the savage warriors chase him all the way as they try to kill him...Co-written, produced & directed by Mel Gibson I had heard good things about Apocalytpo from people who usually wouldn't be seen dead watching a subtitled film, after reading a brief synopsis of the plot I decided to finally watch it & I am glad that I did since I thought Apocalypto was a great film. Apocalypto has a very strong story, even at over two hours long it is never boring or managed to lose my interest, the character's are all strong & despite not one word of English being spoken throughout it's a fairly powerful film that sticks in the memory. The story has various parallels to todays society & certain situation, the main one being what does a peaceful society do when confronted by an evil violent one? It is forced to take action, it is forced to stand up to it's aggressor's even if that mean using violence itself. I suppose that's a concept that has faced man throughout time & I guess there's no easy answer either way. Apocalypto is riveting & I couldn't take my eye (yes, I said eye as I am blind in one eye) off it, it's a captivating & engaging journey stripped back to the bare minimum when man lived off the land & in wooden huts. A simple tale told in thrilling fashion with a real believability, the first hour & a half of the film sets the good versus evil story up, it takes the audience through a guided tour of the ancient Mayna civilisation & that in itself is pretty cool but once Jaguar Paw starts running the film never slows down as a crack team of Mayan warriors with good reason to see him dead pursue him for just under an hour through the lush jungle as the hunted manages to turn the tables & becomes the hunter.Apocalypto is a brilliantly made film, Gibson obviously has an eye for the authentic & I have no reason to question nay aspect of this film or it's basis in reality. The sets, special effects, costumes, make-up, stunts & scenery are all top drawer & make watching Apocalypto an immersing experience. The tour around the Mayan city is great, we see through Jaguar's perspective what the city is like, the little details & the awesomeness of it. Then once the sacrifice scene kicks in it all changes & it becomes a horrible place, a scary place that is unforgiving. Although gory I wouldn't say Apocalypto was excessive, there are a couple of ripped out hearts, someone gets to chew on some animal testicles, there are some decapitated heads, some blood splatter & a few people are shot with arrows or impaled on wooden spikes.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 this wasn't mega budget by any means but looks top notch all the same, filmed in the jungles of Mexico it must have been tough making this. All the unknown actors used here put in excellent performances & with the Mayan dialect they all use facial features & body language to get their feelings & thoughts across extremely well. The scars & artwork on the Mayan bodies is also very striking & gives them all certain personalities.Apocalypto is a great film, there's no two ways about it as far as I am concerned. I don't usually like subtitled films that much as my mind tends to wander but I was glued to this from start to finish, & thematically & visually stunning film that I throughly recommend.",Apocalypto
20,dbborroughs,A grand action adventure of the highest order,8,5 January 2008,"Epic adventure on a grand scale. Mad Mel has made a great adventure film, who's subtitles will keep away a core audience.(Though I guess the idea of the vernacular coming from Indians would have been laughable) The plot has an Indian village raided by the Mayan city. The survivors are carted off for sacrifice (though Jaguar paws wife and children successfully hide in a well.) In the city that are brought to the temple for sacrifice but when they aren't needed, they are ""turned loose"" and used as moving targets. Jaguar Paw escapes and his flight becomes a fight to elude his pursuers and to get back to his family.Its violent, but thats the nature of the story and not necessarily a condemnation of the Maya.(Anyone taking offense at the portrayals of the society should keep in mind this is a look at the city on one day at one brief moment of time) While bits of the story have been been there done that (Naked Prey?), the characters and the sense of place and being somewhere for the first time short circuit any real notion of cliché.This is grand story telling that was a good reason to get to bed really late",Apocalypto

He's taken captive along with the rest of his tribe to a Mayan city where they are to be sacrificed. But when the opportunity to escape arises, he makes a desperate run back to his family with his captors in full pursuit, neither realizing what awaits them.Violent, graphic, and not for the faint of heart. But also an engrossing, exciting action thriller. The subject of pre-Columbian civilizations has always fascinated me. There have been shockingly few movies that covered the Aztecs, the Mayans, or any of the other indigenous American peoples. I love the attention to detail given to the people and culture of the period. I'm sure they didn't get everything right (they never do) but I think they get an A for effort. Mel Gibson deserves credit for helping bring this to the screen in a major production. Also, let's give some praise to the amazing cast, most of whom are unknowns and none of whom are household names. They blew me away. Eight years later and not one more attempt to do a movie like Apocalypto is just sad. I know Gibson's a mess now but surely there are other filmmakers who find the subject matter interesting enough to tackle. Anyway, it's a great movie I definitely recommend you try.",Apocalypto

23,zardoz-13,Mel Gibson is The Greatest!!!,10,16 June 2007,"The Mel Gibson movie ""Apocalypto"" ranks as one of the best adventure films of 2006. Basically, ""Apocalypto"" amounts to a soul-stirring spectacle about human sacrifice and survival set against the last days of the Mayan Empire on the eve of the arrival of Europeans in Central America. Director Mel Gibson, who co-scripted with newcomer Farhad Safinia, does not dwell insufferably on Mayan culture so much as appropriate it as a bloodthirsty backdrop to generate suspense for this old-fashioned, white-knuckled, kill or be killed saga. Indeed, the filmmakers earned their R-rating more for the gallons of fake blood and gore that they splash over the course of the two-hour plus running time, not to mention the ghoulish sight of decapitated heads tumbling like footballs down the side of the temple, than nudity or profanity. Compared with similar scenes from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom""(1984), the sequences where a high temple priest (Fernando Hernandez of ""The Fountain"") cuts hearts out of chests don't appear half as gory. Nevertheless, the faint-hearted may found themselves challenged by such unsavory subject matter. Otherwise, the scenic emerald green jungles teeming with predators and perils as murderous as mankind and the seamless computer-generated imagery of ancient Maya civilization provide ""Apocalypto"" with exotic locales rarely seen in Hollywood movies. In fact, the last time that Tinsel Town produced a movie about Maya culture was the forgettable and equally forgotten Yul Brynner epic ""Kings of the Sun"" (1963) with George Chakiris and Richard Basehart. Like his previous movie ""The Passion of the Christ,"" Gibson lets the characters talk in their native tongue (here it's the dialect of the Mesoamericans) so that you have to put up with subtitles. The subtitles, however, take no longer than a glimpse to grasp. Actually, it's entirely possible to ignore the subtitles and just figure out everything for yourself without having to be told. Gibson gives this simple but personal story all the apparent realism of a National Geographic documentary and the largely amateur cast is so believable that you may want to spend your time watching them instead of what they say.""Apocalypto"" resembles a cross-between of the vintage Italian spear and scandal movies of the late 1950s and early 1960s and the Italian cannibal movies of the 1980s. During the first third of the action, Gibson acquaints us with a small village of hunters isolated in a distant corner of the rain forest. The protagonist, a virile twentysomething hunk named Jaguar Paw (newcomer Rudy Youngblood), has a pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and an adolescent son (Carlos Emilio Baez). The movie opens with Paw and his pals hunting a tapir (basically a wild boar) and this initial episode ultimately foreshadows the dramatic finale. While our heroes are carving up the tapir carcass, another tribe traipses up out of the green and requests permission to cross through their section of the jungle. Jaguar Paw spots the panic in their eyes, and his father counsels the hunters against telling the village about it. Later, we learn that this tribe is fleeing from a band of savage warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo of ""Highlander 3"") who wear more tattoos than any outlaw biker gang and sport some rather painful looking body piercings. These merciless marauders launch a surprise raid on Jaguar Paw's village (think ""Conan the Barbarian""), take all the men and women captive that they don't slaughter, and leave the helpless children behind to fend for themselves. During the second third of the action, Gibson stages the incredible journey of hardship on foot that the villainous warriors and their captives take through the steaming jungle, across swollen rivers, and along sheer cliff sides to a faraway metropolitan Mayan city. Once in the city, Zero Wolf sells off the women and presents the mensmeared now with bright blue body paint as custom dictates--as sacrifices to the gods.Melodrama is all about manipulation and Gibson is the master. What makes ""Apocalypto"" so exciting is that Gibson aligns our sympathy with the underdog hero and his seemingly impossible plight to rescue his wife and child. At the same time, he serves us up some classic villains that we sorely want to see die in the most painful way possible. Before the Mayan warriors descend upon the sleeping village, Jaguar Paw managed to rush his pregnant wife and his son to safety. He lowers them into a hidden pit in nearby rocky terrain, but the villains capture him before he could get them out of it. When he doesn't have us perched on the edge of our seats worrying about how Jaguar Paw is going to escape, Gibson ramps up the tension by cross-cutting to the predicament that pregnant wife Seven deals with when snarling jungle predators enter the pit and a torrential storm threatens to drown them. The suspense--like the excitement--never flags in this hand-to-hand combat saga. Although you know that the hero and the heroine will survive, Gibson and his co-scenarist keep putting them into one hallowing situation after another. One of the best scenes shows a jet-black jaguar chasing our hero through the jungle while a group of homicidal headhunters hell-bent to kill our hero are in hot pursuit, too. Seasoned moviegoers will spot how the last third of the action resembles the Cornel Wilde movie ""The Naked Prey"" (1966), the Jean Claude Van Damme thriller ""Hard Target"" (1993) and the classic ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1932) where an outnumbered hero must triumph over tenacious thugs.Like his Academy Awarding epic ""Braveheart"" and his popular ""Passion of the Christ,"" Mel Gibson proves again that he is a consummate filmmaker who knows how to take an oft-told tale of kinship and revenge and turn it into an evening's worth of entertainment .",Apocalypto
24,Boba_Fett1138,An impressive and intense viewing experience.,8,11 September 2007,"The movie surprised me how adrenaline rushing it was. It's an intense fast movie, with powerful and brutally graphic moments in it.I don't necessarily see this as a movie about the Mayans, I more see this is a movie with Mayans in it. There is a big difference. Movies about Mayans concentrate totally on the culture and also have a more educational value- and also way of story-telling. This movie just more tries to impress and entertaining, with also shedding some light on the Mayan culture, in a not too obvious or forced way. The movie felt accurate and detailed, without ever trying to impress too much with it all. The movie above all is about its characters, rather than their culture.The movie is incredibly good and authentic looking. The costumes, the sets, the makeup, everything feels so real! Also the fine cinematography and the beautiful nature itself of course add to this. I also have to say that the sound was incredible! It was intense at moments and helped to keep your adrenaline going. No wonder that the movie was also nominated for best achievement in sound editing and best achievement in sound mixing, besides the nomination for best achievement in makeup. The movie becomes intense and gory in parts. There is certainly no holding back in the action sequences! This movie is filled with more action than you would perhaps expect from a movie like this. When perhaps first viewing this movie you're expecting a culture drama, it however soon becomes obvious that the movie is (luckily) more intense and action filled than that, without loosing any of its meaning or power. The movie is still filled with some highly effective powerful sequences and images!Every character is deliberately intense looking, with his/hers own distinctive look. It obviously also helps to keep all of the characters apart. Most of them are being played by non-actors which adds to its realism but at times also is a weak spot. It was obvious in this movie that some are simply not born to act. This especially also became obvious with Jonathan Brewer, though he still suits the role fine and it's sort of acceptable for a movie in a 'strange' language such as this one.Even though the movie is an acceptable 139 minutes long, the movie often feels much longer. You can blame Mel Gibson's directing for that. During some sequences I thought; OK we got the point now, lets move on already! For instance this was the case when the entered the large Mayan city and during the execution sequence. Some moments just went on and on and even though they are powerful and impressive looking, you just started to loose interest. Mel Gibson already made the same mistake with ""The Passion of the Christ"" and I had hoped he learned from this. Mel Gibson is a great director now but he can really become a brilliant one of he learns from these and other small mistakes.A great and intense, unique viewing experience!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Apocalypto

26,neil-476,"Good, but hold on to your lunch",8,28 August 2008,"It has already been established that Gibson makes films which purport to be historical, but which are actually no more than fairy tales - both Braveheart and The Patriot leap to mind. So, if one approaches this film assuming it to be a work of pure fiction, but which is dressed up exotically in the trimmings of some past era (and that is exactly how I take it, because I know very little about the Mayans, Aztecs and Incas), what do you get? You get a film which tells a relatively simple story, and tells it very well using the medium of cinema. Yes, it is savage, but human sacrifice is pretty savage. And the third act, the chase, is as well done, if not better, as any similar sequence in any other film.I wasn't sure that the subplot of the wife and child down the pit was necessary other than a reason for coming back to the original village, as a result of which I found the (filmmaker's) visits back to check on them from time to time a bit superfluous and intrusive into the main narrative.But overall I enjoyed it.",Apocalypto
27,ferguson-6,This is my Forest,6,8 December 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Mel Gibson as a technical filmmaker is talented, intriguing and at times ingenious. As a story teller he is mostly mediocre and at times lackluster. That in a nutshell is ""Apocalypto"" ... an amazing film to watch, but in the end, just a shell of a story with no real character development or emotional attachment from the viewer.What Gibson definitely displays is an addiction to gore, violence and scenes of torture. These three are full tilt here with some moments that are too harsh for these comments. Suffice to say, at times it is little more than an artsy slasher film. On the positive side, Gibson's camera work for the never-ending chase scene through the forest/jungle is simply breathtaking and spectacular. When I say never-ending, it is barely an exaggeration. If you thought ""French Connection"" chase scene was long, the last hour plus of this one will have you re-evaluating.The outline of the story is the violent attempts of the Mayans to please the gods with temples and human sacrifices. To meet this end, they pillage innocent villagers in dramatic productions that will make most a bit queasy. Our protagonist is Jaguar Paw (played well by Rudy Youngblood) who spends the entire film either trying to save his family from the pillagers or outrun the bad guys in order to save his family or beat mother nature to the punch trying to save his family.Yes, that is the entire story and many are making a big deal about the allegory and secret message in regards to the Iraqi war, but I find that to be another shallow attempt to give this film the meaning and substance it so desperately lacks. Again, filmed beautifully with remarkable jungle scenes, but just not enough story for the scale it pretends to reach.",Apocalypto
28,anaconda-40658,Gibson Followup to The Passion of the Christ.,8,9 March 2016,"Apocalypto (2006): Dir: Mel Gibson / Cast: Rudy Youngblood, Dalia Hernandez, Raoul Trujillo, Morris Birdyellowhead, Mayra Serbulo: Mel Gibson's followup to his success with The Passion of the Christ with another brutal vision of conclusion that may see light at the end of the dark tunnel. A peaceful tribe is invaded by another tribe. Those whom are not slain are captured and journeyed to the opposing village for sacrifice. One young tribesman called Jaguar Paw managed to hide his pregnant wife and son in a well but that is the least of his concerns upon an escape through the jungle where atmosphere becomes his only ally. As with The Passion of the Christ this is often graphic although sometimes the gruesome effects are unnecessary. Rudy Youngblood plays Juguar Paw with great skill and endurance to survive for both himself and his wife and son. Dalia Hernandez plays his pregnant wife whose hideaway becomes unsafe and her survival at risk. Raoul Trujillo plays Zero Wolf the savage leader of the raiders who will no doubt meet his end after his detailed torture methods are enacted. Morris Birdyellowhead plays Jaguar Paw's wise yet ill fated father. This is not as strong a film as The Passion of the Christ but it resembles it in many ways. What Gibson and his actors accomplish here is the lifestyles of old tribes as well as the dangers of survival. Score: 8 / 10",Apocalypto
29,movieman_kev,whats Mayan is not yours,10,27 May 2007,"Mel Gibson's highly entertaining take on the downfall of the Mayan culture owes a great deal to the original ""Predator"" film, but is still fantastic in it's own right. Gibson is also an extremely divisive guy, and this film definitely won't change your opinion of him. As was true with ""Passion of the Christ"", an extremely well made film that some absolutely love and others loathe with the burning ferocity of a thousand suns, is also true about Apocalypto. Those that sincerely feel that Mayan culture was the most civilized, peaceful, advanced culture on the planet (yes there ARE such fools out there), will show utter disdain and contempt for this film wish shows them warring with themselves quite viscously. However others (the sensible ones) will merely see a beautifully choreographed amazingly great action film that at more then 2 hours still captivates through the length of the film with spectacular edge of your seat action sequences. Of course there are people who can't divorce the fact that Mel said certain things while he was intoxicated and refuse to see anything he's involved in, which is their prerogative, but those people are missing out big time on a classic in the making (I won't even go into the fact that those that can praise a film like ""Powder"" directed by a convicted sack of sh*# pedophile like Victor Salva and refuse to watch anything Gibson because of something he said, is simply mind-boggling). This movie is not only worth watching, it's worth owning on DVD and will become one of the favorites in your collection. All of the actors in this are phenomenal by the way.

30,Wuchakk,Jungle action,7,24 October 2012,"Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" (2006) starts out like a Mayan version of ""Conan the Barbarian"" with the raid and destruction of a forest village and then morphs into a horror story as the captives are babarically sacrificed at the Mayan pyramids to appease their gods; the final act turns into a jungle chase reminiscent of ""The Naked Prey"" and ""Rambo: First Blood"". It also has elements of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Last of the Mohicans."" With the exception of ""The Naked Prey,"" ""Apocalypto"" isn't quite as good as any of these films, but it's still a very good jungle adventure.What makes ""Apocalypto"" a must is the simple fact that there aren't ANY other significant films that depict the Mayan civilization. Just as ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" brought to life the infamous Mongol conqueror and his people, so ""Apocalypto"" effectively brings to life the Mayans.The spoken language is Mayan with subtitles, but this is mainly a visual experience as there's no elaborate dialogue.There's not much else to say. This is essentially a film about the death throes of a civilization and the dawning of a new era. On a more individualist level, it's about recognizing one's true identity, denying fear and the bold spirit of survival. These themes are conveyed with nigh wall-to-wall jungle action and horror.The film was shot in Mexico and runs 2 hours and 19 minutes.GRADE: B+",Apocalypto
31,gradyharp,National Geographic Visual Splendor without the Historical Depth Needed,7,7 June 2007,"Viewing APOCALYPTO is a visual and visceral experience: some of the most beautiful cinematic depictions of skies, jungles, raging rivers and extraordinary recreations of Mayan temples and peoples fill the screen for a very long two and a half hours. The images include excessive violence (beheadings, punjee stake traps, genocidal type destruction of a village of people, brutalized slaves, etc) and concentrate more on chases than on drama. But the effect presented is richly colorful and imaginative.There is little story to tell. A quiet and fearless tribe spends its time hunting, teasing a fellow tribesman about his infertility and making him the brunt of cruel jokes - just the ordinary camaraderie we are led to believe - until our main character Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) hears a shudder in the jungle that results in his tribe being overtaken by a more aggressive, human sacrificing tribe. The village is burned, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and child in a well, and he and the remaining villagers are taken into slavery and marched to the Mayan capital where they are sacrificed by Mayan priests to appease the gods to save their crumbling empire. A sun eclipse saves Jaguar Paw, he escapes, and after an interminable chase through the jungle reunites with his wife and children just as the Spanish conquistadors sail into harbor.The cast responds well to the direction of Mel Gibson. Outstanding among them are of course Rudy Youngblood, Dalia Hernández, Jonathan Brewer, Morris Birdyellowhead, María Isabel Díaz, Espiridion Acosta Cache, Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias among others. But nearly as much credit goes to the costumer and hairpiece design (Mayes C. Rubeo) and to the set builders (Jay Aroesty) of the Mayan Temples. Visually the movie is stunning though in a graphically gross sort of way. The problem lies with the lack of significant information about the fall of the Mayan Empire, one of the more advanced civilizations known: Gibson would have us see only the brutal savagery of a highly sophisticated body of people. A sad depiction of a great nation. Grady Harp",Apocalypto
32,safenoe,A Mel Gibson masterpiece,9,9 October 2016,"As a director, Mel Gibson delivered a masterpiece in Apocalypto. Much has been written about it, and the finale was impressive. I think one of the producers played one of the Spanish conquistadors on the boat heading to shore. I would really liked to have known how the meeting of the conquistadors with the Mayans unfolded. The conquistadors spoke Spanish (of course), the Mayans had their language, so no interpreters I guess. Also how did the conquistadors and their staff on the ship have enough food to live? It's a brutal film and if you're a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, then turn away please because it's all subtitles.

33,The_Void,Realistic and brutal - a fascinating piece of cinema!,8,28 January 2008,"One common criticism of modern movies is that they're often unoriginal; but that certainly can't be said of this film. I was never a big fan of Mel Gibson as an actor, but he proved with the highly controversial 'Passion of the Christ' that he's not afraid to take risks; and that fact is further reinforced with this film. The fact that it focuses on the Mayan civilisation is risky enough (considering that the majority of cinema goers probably wont even have heard of it), but then add in the fact that Gibson has chosen to film it in Mayan language, and the fact that it's brutal and gory - and you have a mainstream Hollywood that is keen to be as far from 'commercial' as possible! The first half of the film introduces us to the main cast of characters and we get to see how they live, hunt and joke with one another. Their lives are interrupted one day when another Mayan tribe bursts into their village; burning the houses and taking the men hostage. In particular we focus on Jaguar Paw, one of the hunters who miraculously manages to escape from becoming a Sun God sacrifice. He runs off into the jungle, with a tribe of savage hunters on his tail...Apocalypto is a movie of two halves; the first half introduces us to the characters, while the second half is more of a bloody chase movie as we witness the central character being pursued across the jungle. The best thing about this movie is its realism and attention to detail. Mel Gibson brilliantly depicts the locations used (including a lush jungle and an authentic looking Mayan settlement) as well as the actors, who as ensemble put in fantastic performances. Considering that pretty much everyone involved in the film had never been in a movie before, it's all the more impressive. Gibson has shown with both of his directorial efforts prior to this film that he's not afraid to show some gore - and that is the case here too! The sacrifice scene is particularly brutal, and there's more than enough fighting for even the most exploitative taste. A scene in which a jaguar chews off a man's face is a particular highlight. The film is thoroughly entertaining for its two hour running time. I do have to question the point of the movie, but not too much because I enjoyed watching it, which is always the most important thing. Overall, Apocalypto comes highly recommended to all and I'm looking forward to seeing what Gibson comes up with next!",Apocalypto
34,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Apocalypto,9,17 January 2007,"The passion of the predator braveheart blair witch fugitive gladiator who dances with wolves in the temple of doom.That in essence, is the summarized version of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto, written, produced and directed by the man himself (see if you can spot the references above during various points in the movie). Following relative successes with Braveheart and Passion of the Christ, one of the first thing that strikes you is that Apocalypto brought over the violence and gore from those movies, and itself also a period piece, this time set in the Mayan civilization at its decline. It contains two different views, of the peaceful fun loving nature of simple villagers, versus the decadence of a race of people drunk on mindless religious fervour culminating in needless sacrifices, pitting one lifestyle against the other, turning a race against their own.For those who might not enjoy the movie, my guess is they were expecting Mayan Culture 101. Sorry, wrong movie folks, even though the trailer might have suggested some deep profound thoughts and focus on a civilization now long gone. This is a movie about family and survival. Pure and simple. Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is the William Wallace of the story, a man who finds himself against odds, struggling to survive in order to get back to the family he had to abandon, during the protection of the honour of his village against the Holcane Warriors, as we see how his life journeyed and paralleled that of an animal hunt featured in the very first scene.While the movie takes its time to establish characters, and despite the audience only getting glimpses of their names in the subtitles, somehow you'll still be able to identify and identify with them, maybe because the key cast are memorable. As soon as the action starts, it doesn't take its foot off the pedal, moving along at fanatical pace, and most times leaving you at the edge of your seat, despite being able to predict the outcome and certain details how it would have played out. It's all in the execution, and familiarity aside, they delivered.But it's not all just mindless action. Action with a powerful motif behind the violence, blood and gore, somewhat makes you root for Jaguar Paw as he claws his way out of the doldrums. One thing's for sure, never anger a family man, as even the Heavens smile and provide much needed luck. The movie is also sprinkled with themes about fear, and the power that it wields, and a subtle environmental message, which I thought mirrored Frank Herbert's Dune.James Horner's score added much mood to a movie which had little dialogue when the going gets rough, and relied on subtitles to translate the Mayan language on screen. But it goes to show that a movie doesn't require powerful dialogues in order to engage, so long as the score is able to evoke the right mood at the right moments, which Horner does wonderfully. The movie seldom betrays the fact that it's being shot in digital format, until those blair- witch up close facial expression shots hints at the crispness and lack of a distinct film look.Most of the actors here are rookies, but the ensemble together worked wonders. They make you believe, the heroes make you cheer, and the villains will make you hiss and spit. Given his charisma, we might see Rudy Youngblood in more roles, and I thought that he would make an engaging action hero, which the Hollywood of today is in woefully need of.I'd say Mel Gibson hasn't disappointed with the films he directed, and I don't see how Apocalypto wouldn't be enjoyed by the masses here. But I'd predict its chances at the Oscars would have been diminished by Gibson's drunken rant. A pity, for a film like this.",Apocalypto
35,JamesHitchcock,"Death has a hundred hands, and walks by a thousand ways",7,22 January 2007,"During a war, a group of warriors ransack an enemy village. They massacre many of the villagers, and take most of the others prisoner. The captives are forced to march back to their captors' capital city, where a young man manages to escape. He flees for his life, with the enemy in hot pursuit, hoping to make his way back to his home and to be reunited with his wife and young son who survived the massacre. That could be the plot of a Second World War film, or of a Western, or even (with a few modifications) of a modern crime thriller. Mel Gibson, however, has taken this fairly standard plot and given it a new twist by setting it in the context of the Maya civilisation of Central America. The film is set in the Yucatan peninsula, today part of Mexico, during the early 16th century, a period when the Maya culture was in decline from its Classical greatness. The hero, Jaguar Paw, and his enemies are presumably members of two rival tribes. The exact cause of the war is never made clear, but the warriors who attack the village are motivated by a desire to take prisoners who can be ritually slaughtered as a sacrifice to their gods. Jaguar Paw has a miraculous escape from death when a solar eclipse, which occurs during the sacrifice ceremony, is interpreted as a sign that the gods have drunk their fill of blood. He and a number of companions are then released, but only so that they can provide target practice for the spears and bows of the enemy army; Jaguar Paw is the only one who manages to survive this ordeal and reach the comparative safety of the jungle. Although the Spanish conquistadors make a brief entrance at the end, I did not (unlike some reviewers) see the film as a justification of European colonialism. If Gibson had wanted to justify Spanish colonial rule he would presumably have made a film comparing the two cultures and endeavouring to prove that the European one was superior to the Native American one. Such a film might have been difficult to make, given that the Spaniards and their Inquisition had, in the form of the auto-da-fe, their own form of ritual human sacrifice, quite as bloody as that of the Mayas.The film has also been criticised for being allegedly too violent, although given its theme, some violence is only to be expected. It would be difficult to make a non-violent film about human sacrifice. We see the victims having their hearts torn out and then being beheaded. Not all the deaths that we see, however, result from deliberate homicide. During the latter part of the film, when Jaguar Paw is fleeing through the jungle from his enemies, a number of them meet their ends in various accidental, although grisly, ways. One is killed by a jaguar, another by a poisonous snake, and their leader is impaled by a trap set to catch tapirs. I was reminded of T.S. Eliot's line (from ""Murder in the Cathedral"") that ""Death has a hundred hands, and walks by a thousand ways"". When I first saw the film, I thought that it was a straightforward ""chase"" movie and that Gibson's use of an exotic setting and of the local language, Yucatec, were simply gimmicks designed to draw attention to his film. Having thought about the matter, I am not so sure. Although the exciting chase sequence is an important part of the film, ""Apocalypto"" is more than simply a chase movie. It is also a film about man's inhumanity to man. (This presumably explains the portentous title, which as far as I am aware means nothing in any language but has obvious echoes of ""apocalypse"" and ""apocalyptic""). This is a common theme in the cinema, but in films made for Western audiences it is normally presented in the context of a few standardised settings. The most common setting, of course, is the Second World War and the Holocaust; recent years have seen two very distinguished examples in Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and Polanski's ""The Pianist"". There have also been examples set during the First World War (""All Quiet on the Western Front""), in the Soviet Union (""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich""), in South Africa under apartheid (""Cry Freedom""), in the American West (""Soldier Blue"") and in the context of a few well-known modern day massacres such as Cambodia (""The Killing Fields"") and Rwanda (""Hotel Rwanda""). By taking this familiar theme, and placing it in the unfamiliar context of human sacrifice in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, Gibson is making the point that brutality and inhumanity are not the exclusive property of the Nazis, or the Communists, or Europeans, or Americans, or any one race or culture. They are part of the human condition. Gibson, a devout Catholic, would doubtless see them as being inherent in the concept of the Fall of Man. Even those of us who are not Catholics can respond to the universality of his theme. 7/10",Apocalypto
36,Smells_Like_Cheese,I don't know what to say other than this is an incredible movie,10,19 March 2008,"I have to confess, when I saw the trailer for Apocalypto a couple years ago, but it looked over done and boring. When I was at Hollywood Video, I couldn't really decide on a film and just decided to see what this was about. I watched Apocalypto last night and I have to say that this is one of the most memorable films that I have seen in a while. I mean, this film had my whole attention, while the violence is most definitely disturbing to an extreme point, the story is absolutely incredible and wonderful. It's rare now days to have an original movie in Hollywood, everything is always ripped off or paid as an ""omage"" to something, or is a remake of a classic film. Mel Gibson brought us something that as uncomfortable as it was, it was an incredible film, the acting, the make up, the sets, the story, the language, everything in this film is just makes it's mark and exceeds at what it's moral is: courage and strength.Jaguar Paw is a member of his Mayan tribe, his destiny is to be a hero, but he doesn't necessarily believe it, but he's going to have to start believing in himself if he is to help his pregnant wife and child from a ravage attack from another tribe who is about to offer himself and others as sacrifices. But he must remain strong to save his family and go through the ultimate and most horrific game of cat and mouse when he escapes the warriors and now is running for his life.Apocalypto is a very strong movie and I'm so glad that I decided to rent it, I can't tell you, I've been thinking about this film a lot, it had such an effect on me. I think because the story is just so incredible and realistic as well as disturbing. I just loved how Jaguar Paw stood up to the warriors and finally fought back, it was so inspirational and great the way he fought. He and his family bring you back to the feeling of just loving your family and protecting them with whatever will you can. I highly recommend this film, it's absolutely amazing and will leave you speechless afterwards.10/10",Apocalypto
37,disdressed12,brutally violent but very well done,9,19 September 2009,"this is one brutally violent film,so if you have a weak stomach for violence,you might want to avoid it.it starts in a Mayan village,showing the peaceful family life of the tribe,complete with family bickering and and fun,and tomfoolery.then,all hell breaks loose,and the peace is shattered.from there,it's all a story of survival.and that's when things get brutal.throughout the movie,the ingenuity and cleverness of the Mayans is shown.Magyver would have been right at home.the whole film is subtitled from the Mayan(at least i think it's Mayan)language into English.clearly this was an ambitious project.it's very detailed,and probably pretty accurate for the most part.i thoroughly enjoyed it,though like i said it is brutally violent,though there are also moments of tenderness and heartbreak.for me,Apocalypto is a 9/10",Apocalypto
38,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Decent but bigger on spectacle than on an engaging story,5,22 December 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Set in the ancient Mayan civilization, Jaguar Paw (Joshua Youngblood) is a young warrior with a child and pregnant wife who finds his homeland invaded by warriors who've decided the way forward is to enslave people from his homeland and make human sacrifices. Forced to go on the run, he is eventually drawn into an all out battle with these invaders in a desperate struggle to come out alive.Mel Gibson's been lending his name to some more subversive stuff these last few years, what with biblical re-tellings that create storms of anti-sematism and now this imagining of the ancient Mayan society. Straight away this is going to alienate most people who know nothing about this ancient culture or most of the unknown actors who resemble what proper Mayans would look like, which just makes it look more like something that belongs in an art house, not on the big screen.The film draws you in more on spectacle rather than on plot. With some spectacular set design, we are sweepingly drawn into this ancient but magnificent time and place, with it's pyramids, castles and devices. The large crowds gathering, walking and moving about somehow manage to make it look even more real and therefore more awe-inspiring. Then there are, of course, the battle sequences. These are catchy and blood thirsty enough, probably explaining the 18 certificate (although Gibson probably pushed it a bit with one character exclaiming ""he's fu*ked"" in a scene towards the end, which a Mayan warrior back then probably wouldn't have said.) To be fair, it's not as heavy handed as you might think, either. There's a surprising splash of humour and light, especially at the beginning, where we see these people in their civilization laughing and joking, essentially the same as we probably would in ours. The film through-out is striving to present these characters in their full human glory, trying to draw us into their internal conflicts and insecurities as well as the battle on the outside. But personally, this tale of a time and place is one I wouldn't rush out to watch again. ***",Apocalypto
39,ElMaruecan82,A film that touches the essence of filmmaking like no other movie did in recent years...,10,15 September 2018,"This is one of these films you start taking notes and at the end, you have enough to write a whole thesis. Think about it, filmmaking all comes down to three simple things: a good film should be an immersion, it should transport you into a world, you've (ideally) never seen before. Then it should make you believe while removing any hint of 'make believe' and artifices. Finally, a film is about having a story to tell, the minimum requirement. Today's movies just toy with these elements. Any film dealing with the real world wouldn't have a hard time making you believe in its realness; any reboot or remake will exploit pre-known sensations. As for stories, they all evolve in the realm of predictability with stock characters and structures borrowed from screenwriting workshops. There's an interesting side to explore in today's filmmaking but it's quite marginal.The merit of ""Apocalypto"" is to achieve cinematic perfection in the blockbuster's world, it's a film that restores your faith in Hollywood, even old-school Hollywood because the reconstitution of the Mayan pyramid is an achievement that could have been swept off by CGI, but Gibson and his talented crew did it the De Mille way, building a replica of a Mayan pyramid from the Golden Age (a historical license that contributed to one of the film's most spectacularly brutal sequences). The dedication of Gibson and his crew members was such that there is no moment in the film where you don't believe you're watching the real Mayas, that Mesoamericans have seldom been the subjects of a mainstream movie might have contributed to the film's freshness but there's more to it: we've seen tribes in movies before but often from the perspective of 'civilized' men, even when the indigenes were the focus (""Little Big Man"" or ""The Emerald Forest"") the white man wasn't far. ""Apocalypto"" is exclusively about one civilization... at the twilight of its existence, destroying itself from within through slave trading, human sacrifices and deforestation. I end with the lesser one to show how far such a civilization went in terms of development and yet was still capable of atrocities. Those who accused the film of racism miss the point: through the portrayal of a civilization indulging to barbarity while being culturally advanced, it's not too far-fetched to guess which fear-mongers Gibson is indirectly targeting. Fear is indeed a recurring theme in the film, starting with Mayan friends who witness the ravages inflicted to men before being their own victims. The hero Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is warned by his father never to let fear infect his heart for there's no way out after. This exchange exemplifies what I consider the Gibsonian hero, a man who confronts the ugly side of life armed with an unshakable faith that he's serving the right cause, a hero that refuses martyrdom because martyrs accept death while heroes challenge it.The film starts like ""Braveheart"" with a playful and enjoyable tone (even a few jokes involving the village's ""punching bag""), before the village is destroyed, children left alone, prisoners taken and Jaguar Paw's father killed like William Wallace's wife. The road to the Mayan city is paved with many obstacles, one of them allows one of the villains to show his brutal side while their chief, the merciless Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo) shows that he's more than a bad-ass looking nemesis but also a natural born leader and a caring father-figure. And then there's the city where without any dialogues, we get a glimpse on Mayan society. Even without knowing anything about the civilization, I could tell from the hair-styles, the make-ups and the scarifications, the upper classes from the lower. A bunch of women waving their fans and having weird mounted hair-dos left me with the impression that they were bourgeois. Still, the 'society' is more brutal judging by the way they ask their God to end the drought, going for it all 'Temple of Doom' way. Well, what do you expect from a Gibson movie?The sacrifice marks a pivotal moment in Jaguar Paw's journey before the chase starts, a few steps away from the altar, he says he's not going to die, believing in a sort of mystical predestination, and a miracle makes it happen. When he's given a chance to escape from his enemies the chase that follows becomes the real test of his predestination, in a more Darwinian sense, confronting him to obstacles as animals, waterfalls, or moving sands as if even nature had something to say.
 And one by one, the pursuers fall while an infectious fear fills their heart... the great thing about the chase besides the fact that without any CGI, it's more heart-pounding than any space battle, superhero fight or car chase put together, it's that it's not as one-directional as it looks, the villains are literally running after death and without spoiling the ending, the survivors end up facing a not too promising sight. While Paw runs toward life, incarnated by his pregnant wife, trapped in a hole with their first-born son. ""Apocalypto"" is a chase between people running after their end whether you take it at an individual or eschatological level and a man who pursues life, whether his own or a whole culture's life, the choice he makes at the end is the right one and we know it.For its use of an authentic language like for ""Passion of the Christ"", convincing make-up, locations, practical effects, even animatronics, emphasize the immersion. There's no movie done recently that matches the level of cinematic perfection as ""Apocalypto"" and this is why it was endorsed by many celebrities and not the least: Scorsese, Tarantino, Spike Lee... but where was the Academy?While the film got three nominations, it didn't earn Gibson one for director... that's how politics can sadly cloud judgments because if disliking a person is one thing but anyone with a semblance of cinematic taste should adore ""Apocalypto"".",Apocalypto
40,MOscarbradley,(Bloody) offensive,3,6 February 2008,"Banal and irredeemably brutal. What is it with Mel Gibson anyway? Less offensive, certainly, than ""The Passion of the Christ"", (I can't see too many Mayans registering their protest), this is, nevertheless, a pretentious, crude movie. It's well-made and the central section, (the slaughter at the temple), is very well directed, (Gibson knows how to marshall a crowd), and, although conventional, the lengthy chase sequence that takes up the film's second half is reasonably exciting.But it's the brutality and excessive blood-letting that relegates it to the third-rate. Gibson seems to relish sadism so what little skill he might have as a film-maker is dissipated. And the script is so trite that the choice of filming it in Yucatec, (for 'authenticity' one presumes), is somewhat lost. This is no more authentic than any other piece of Hollywood hokum on the subject and rather than look like native Peruvians the cast seem to hail from South Central LA. Pretty pictures, yes, with a leading man who is more photogenic than he ought to be, but ultimately too nasty to merit serious consideration.",Apocalypto
41,dromasca,"lots of blood, too little soul",6,8 June 2007,"If one tries to ignore Mel Gibson for his off-screen adventures and positions on all sort of political or spiritual matters, what is left is one of the most skilled directors and efficient producers in Hollywood. Gibson knows how to pick his subjects from history, and how to project them into his own world which seems to be built upon a mix of morals, conservative politics and violence. The message that he seems to repeat is that small cultures were and are under permanent danger of being crashed by evil empires, and his stories are speaking about the desperate fight, death and redemption of the righteous in a very personal and most violent style. One can agree or disagree, but it usually works well.'Apocalypto' tries to bring to screen to the smallest detail the disappeared world of the pre-Columbian Maya empire we know little about. It does so with a very careful construction of sets, elaborated costumes, spectacular landscapes and excellent actors directing. Actors work is really special here, each character has a life of its own, language is not at all of barrier, and even the mannerism of some of the 'primitives' acting seems pragmatically in tune with work of the great early American directors.And yet, the ultimate feeling is not so satisfactory. Maybe the Hollywood action movies style is too much emphasized on the expense of the authenticity. Or maybe the final 'surprize' is too expected. Or maybe it is the endless violence that dominates so much the movie and occupies so many minutes out of the total duration of the film, that at the end the risk is that it will be the violence that we shall remember and not too much more.",Apocalypto

And to my surprise it was no where near as gory as Braveheart or Passion of the Christ. I was expecting a lot more graphic violence with lots of blood but it really isn't there. That doesn't mean it's for kids, but don't let the violence prevent you from seeing this.The story is simply. A young husband and farther, Jaguar Paw, is captured by the Mayans along with the rest of his tribe. He is able to hide his family in a well and they are trapped there. They are taken to the Mayan city where there is drought and disease. They are there to be human sacrifices to appease their gods. Here is where the worst of the violence takes place with hearts ripped out and bodies thrown down stairs. Jaguar Paw is saved by chance and then manages to escape while his captures have fun trying to kill him.The rest of the movie is him outwitting his pursuers as he makes his way back to his wife. One moment of unbelievability is him out running a jaguar for some distance. That just isn't possible.But the story is great and the subtitles are not annoying.

The Mayan tribe depicted in this movie have been kidnapped for slaves and sacrifices. Jaguar Paw, son of the leader, will do anything to escape and save his family.The actors in this movie are relatively unknown. They did a somewhat decent job. Rudy Youngblood was the best because he played Jaguar Paw.The scenery and cinematography are absolutely astonishing.

I do not think movies get any better than this.I did note that the cynics said this film reflects Gibson' penchant for violence...? Give me a break! There is little known about the Mayans -- thanks to the Christian friar who became their friend and then decided the world would be better off if he burned 99.9% of their books -- not to mention the core paradox THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD 1000s of BOOKS READY FOR BURNING? -- but their artwork clearly shows that, whatever their mysterious origins, by the end of their empire they had devolved toward an addiction to human sacrifice.(Much like other more recent empires I could name ... but again I digress).Given what he had to work with -- a mysterious people with a lost history -- Gibson not only created a glorious film but also a really neat revenge tale as well.Highest rating.

46,CuriosityKilledShawn,Mel Gibson and the Temple of Doom,6,12 January 2007,"Take Gibson's ego. Add an several tablespoons of Aztec. Mix with 2 parts Indiana Jones and 1 part Predator. Blend for 139 minutes and you get Apocalypto. Is that even a real word? As hyped-up as it is, it's really nothing you ain't seen before. Jaguar-Paw and his tribe-folk live in a quaint corner of the Rainforest. One day some evil er...people turn up for some good old rape and pillage. Whoever is not slain is taken captive and led on a long journey to some Aztec city where they are either sold as slaves or sacrificed atop massive pyramids for the viewing pleasure of the friendly locals and the satisfaction of the Gods.Jaguar-Paw just happens to be part of a silly prophecy uttered by a dying girl and he will bring death, vengeance blah blah blah to the baddies. This scene really does belong in another movie altogether. But sure enough, just as Jaguar-Paw is about to have his heart ripped-out Mola Ram style there is an eclipse. The Aztecs believe that their God's blood-lust has been quenched so they let him go. Kinda.Jaguar Paw mutilates the Head Honcho Evil Dude's son as he begins his escape back to the destroyed village. His pregnant wife and kid are hiding at the bottom of a pit and he promised to get back to them. But Head Honcho and his bunch of psychos don't take too kindly to losing one of their own so the hunt begins.At this point the movie is basically, in many ways, the last act of Predator, only without a 7-foot tall Rastafarian or Arnie shouting 'GET TO DA CHOPPA!' Jaguar Paw sets several traps for the hunters and they all die one-by-one in various gory ways. You'll find something VERY familiar about all of this.It's an entertaining, if thoroughly pointless film that makes no particular statement whatsoever. Mel clearly exaggerates Aztec history to the point of the film becoming some kind of bizarre science-fiction fantasy. I really don't know where the inspiration for this film came from but if he wanted to make a timeless epic then shooting in 1.85:1 HD was a mistake. I doubt Laurence of Arabia or even his own Braveheart, as period pieces, would have been so fondly cherished if they have been shot this way.I don't see any Oscars in Apocalypto's future, but at least Mel has stayed away from offending any contemporary religions this time.",Apocalypto

Decade later he made hideous The Passion of the Christ, but improvement in directing and production is huge. And two years later we get Apocalypto that overcomes both predecessors beyond comparison.

49,tabuno,An Amazing Humanistic Story of Ancient Mayan Culture,9,22 January 2019,"16 December 2006. Mel Gibson has created a fascinating and compelling vision of life in the Mayan forest, a heart-pounding but intimate and personally vivid image and sensory delight of human interaction, of human cruelty, and dramatic human realism. This serious piece of cinematic history is vast in its scope but also focused on the personal trauma of the meaning of family. Mr. Gibson was wise to avoid the use of known actors in order that the primary attention would be on the events and personal behavior and communication that emotes a truly captivating drama. One of the best movies of the year, Gibson's film captures the essence of story-teller at its best, particularly in its recasting a story telling scene onto the large screen. Except for a few unbelievable situations or occurrences such as tracking in a forest and the confluence of almost unimaginable events, the screenplay and its performance are brilliant.

50,ironhorse_iv,"Apocalypto is worth sacrificing time to go see, even if this movie is highly historical inaccurate. It was still a unique watch.",8,17 December 2016,"Made before actor/director Mel Gibson's career went downhill after his post-2007 anti-Semitism and racism rants became public and set in pre-Columbian Yucatan and Guatemala around the year 1511, 'Apocalypto' features a world in which, the Mayan civilization was in a horrific state of depravity, scourged with drought, famine, and diseases. In response to all this, the priests are demanding more human sacrifices in order to please the Gods, and save their civilization. It's here, where tribesman, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) finds himself, one of those men, chosen to be killed for the Gods. In order to avoid his fate, Jaguar must escape his capturers, and rescue his family, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and their young son, whom he hid from the marauders in an empty well. Without spoiling the movie, too much, one thing, that the movie got right is the essentially the meaning behind the opening quote of the movie; the Mayan civilization was killing itself long before the Spanish conquistadors came by. Even if that quote from historian/writer Will Durant was meant for the Roman Empire, not Mesoamerica. The film really does capture the theory that environmental degradation which led to famine and eventually social unrest, led to Classic Maya civilization collapse which most historians agree that the director/writer Mel Gibson got right. However, Gibson still got a few things wrong. While, it was true that some Mayan cities still existed on the apex of the Spaniard arrived, in truth, most of Mayan civilization collapse happened some 600 years earlier. Also, the imagery of smallpox, playing a part of the collapse is highly fictional. Anybody with a history or science book, knows that there is no credible descriptions of smallpox-like disease in the Americas before the westward exploration by Europeans in the 15th century AD. While, I champion that Gibson hired a cast of Indigenous Mexican and Native American as the Mayans, and filmed them, speaking entirely in the Yucatec Mayan language. He still got them, wrong. For example, it's very rare that Jaguar's tribe, would still be a hunter/gatherer primitive society who lives in their own detach world, within the Mayan Empire at that time period. I'm not saying, it's not possible, but it would be extremely rare for an isolate group like that to live in region where known cities are few miles away from each other, and where agriculture had been the dominant form of subsistence for thousands of years. Not only that, but they would had look more civilize with brightly colored, yarn-based, textiles that are woven into capes, shirts, blouses, huipiles and dresses, rather than looking like caveman islanders in loincloth. Despite that, Gibson and his crew got the tattoos, scarification, and earlobe extensions to all of the on-screen actors, very accurate to the time period. Most of the make-up work were amazing. Added to that, the acting was very good. The cinematography from Dean Semler was equally as great. Every camera shot was astonishing to see. Even the music by composer James Horner made me, feel like I was honorably there in that era. The city sets were also remarkable, since Gibson rely on visual sets, than relying on computer-generated images. It look very real. However, the sheer scale of the human sacrifices by the city folks, plus the practice of raiding smaller villages and settlements in order to capture slaves and sacrifices' victims. It more reminiscent, the Aztecs than the Mayans at the time. It didn't look historical accurate. While, this sadistic portrayal of the Mayans might anger some historians. I do understand, what Gibson was going for. It's not a movie about the best years of Mayan enlightened age. It's a film that portray them in their worst. It is no differ than other civilization in the brick of collapse. While, the sacrifice scenes were hard to watch for some people. I found it, to be very effective. It was very intense. I also found the violent action chase scenes in this film to be, very thrilling to watch. Great work from everybody that did the gore effects in this film. Even if, they goof a bit, like having the main character, somehow being able to run and heal, despite getting an arrow through his abdomen. The movie had to be brutal with its violent imagery, because how metaphoric, the material is. Gibson wrote the script as if to make the unknown alien-like world of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, felt more real and relatable to modern society. It's supposed to represent the uneasy feelings of today Americans, felt where any minute, violence, widespread environmental degradation, excessive consumption and political corruption can destroy you and your family, out of existing. No wonder, why the 2012 Mayan Doomsday Calendar and portrayal of the Christians Book of Revelation was so popular, during the time-line, when this movie is made. The film overtones is supposed to be dogmatic, destruction and pessimistic. It explains, why so many people went to see this movie. Yet, I like to think, there were some that were looking for a more positive physical or spiritual transformation message with the metaphors of Christianity that Gibson is trying to say, with the arrival of the Conquistadors and the breaking of the drought with the Mayans believers, even if both were a bit divine judgment. It's the idea that rebirth is possible. Overall: In the end, that positive message of hope is the strongest thing that 'Apocalypto' can bring to the table. Not it's Doomsday calendar. Highly recommended seeing.",Apocalypto
51,nairtejas,The Life We Never Lived. ♦ 77%,8,15 August 2013,"Mel Gibson has tried and succeeded in unleashing the meaning of culture & the different facets of life altogether.It chiefly talks about the way life works on some parts of the world as we are hooked on to texting that person we met in a coffee shop. The setup of Maya civilization is terrific. With not so gigantic budget, the makers have created a dent in the epic/adventure genre. Cinematography isn't that great but the screenplay is fine. Music & score is relevant & I am impressed with the character building. Of course the Mayan civilization is pure genius, the depiction is immense colorful & genuine.The performance is very good played by totally determined chaps. Although, this is not for everyone and the large amount of violence involved may shoo away some people in the initial minutes.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for classic cinema lovers. 7.7 out of 10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

52,slightlymad22,Blew Me Away,8,8 February 2017,"Apocalypto (2006)Plot In A Paragraph: As the Mayan kingdom faces its decline, the rulers insist the key to prosperity is to build more temples and offer human sacrifices. Jaguar Paw, a young man set for sacrifice, flees to avoid his fate.Apocalypto is a victory for Gibson, who was still unpopular with some in the summer of 2006!! I'm sure you all remember the details.  DUI.  Hate-filled rant.  ""Sugar t*ts"" etc and just your typical celebrity melt-down in general. Gibson did the usual Hollywood thing, he apologised and his publicist released statements promising Mel would go to rehab etc!! Apocalypto is one hell of a movie. Again, I'd much rather watch something like this, than another Fast & Furious or Transformers movie. All of the action I'd first rate, and during the last hour it just never lets up. It's possibly the longest, most intense chase in movie history. This was only my second time watching the movie, and I think it loses something not seeing it on the big screen. People can say what they want about him, but the man can direct a quality movie. As with his last two directing efforts, Gibson isn't shy in showing us brutal violence. The fact that people put aside their feelings on Gibson, Andre movie, a general aversion to subtitles to go see this movie at the cinema is why I consider this a victory for Gibson. Some speculated that Gibson's career was over. His scandals were still fresh in everyone's mind, when this movie was released. It was a violent movie in a foreign language about an ancient Mayan civilization.  A tough movie to sell without the scandal.  Many expected audiences to stay away in droves, And yet, audiences still showed up.  It seemed Gibson was being given a second chance by audiences.",Apocalypto
53,paulclaassen,"Very well made film, but low rating due to it being a difficult film to watch that left me feeling sick.",3,25 June 2019,"'Apocalypto' is a very depressing film. With all the brutality and torture, this was not a pleasant watch. The inhumane way people were being treated was disgusting, as well as the graphic animal killings. Mel Gibson doesn't spare us any of the details. This is therefore a very real depiction of what actually happened so many years ago.I actually watched a Mayan documentary to authenticate the Mayan brutality, and it is indeed very realistic. I believe Gibson wanted to bring across the reality of the situation. He succeeded to such an extent that the film left me feeling sick at times.The film's final moments were very good, as the film switched genre to become a vengeance thriller. Rudy Youngblood was very good as the hero, Jaguar Paw. He did an incredible job and I enjoyed the character development.However, there's only a few films I wish I'd not have seen.

54,Dr_Coulardeau,Mel Gibson crosses the Book of Revelation with Abel and Cain,10,14 January 2007,"Superb and breathtaking. Let's be clear. First of all 75% of all Maya inscriptions we know have not yet been deciphered and all we have on these Indians is one thousandth of what we would need to know just a little bit about the way these Indians lived, what's more thought. The vanity of those who say some details are wrong is absurd, especially since the cinema is not a tool to tell the truth but the art of complete illusion. A false detail can only be the drop that will make the bitter-minded overflow and the straw that will break the backs of the growling grouchers. So let me not be avaricious about this film. It reaches some extraordinary magnitude and magnificence. The pictures are among the most beautiful you can imagine, be they of the forest, or of the crossing of the river, or of the waterfalls on the same river, or of the Maya city and its pyramid temples, or of the costumes of their priests, or of the gladiator games for final cynegetic execution. The action itself is so well built that we get involved in it so intensely that we are in the body of the hunted one, without remission, without any relapse. And yet a long slow phase enables the viewer to contemplate the simple life spiritually full with tales and legends in a village in the midst of the rain forest. It is not an anthropological film, but at this level it is a film that wants to introduce us into a completely unknown setting and it succeeds marvellously, be it the physical setting or be it the spiritual and mental setting. The way Gibson uses the face expressivity of his actors, all of them amateurs though, to tell more than half of the psychological and emotional density and even passions of his characters and situations is outstanding. Some say the story is held up with pieces of strings like an eclipse that comes just when necessary. But we mustn't forget that life is only held up by such pieces of string and that simple events like a train that does not run may change the destiny of thousands of people. Life is nothing but the result of haphazard and unforeseeable whims from our environment. Some also protest against this « hollywoodian » film without telling us what it means. The film was entirely shot in Mexico exclusively using non-professional actors from an ethnic group so far never seen on the silver screen before, entirely in their language, the modern form of Maya, and entirely subtitled. These are elements that can be considered as perfectly anti-hollywoodian. If it is the spectacular show that is at stake, then many other films, like Besson's Purple Rivers, are nothing but hollywoodian films. And then what ? The most serious critics say that Mel Gibson is pondering on the fate of civilizations when they reach their final phase of self-destruction. It's both proper viewing and false understanding. It is the minimum discourse that we can see in these absurd human sacrifices to make an eclipse come and go or to palliate several years of bad crops with self mutilation, cannibal self sacrifice, suicidal self-centered morbidity. It is in a way the official method to adjust the population to the means available for survival set in some grandiose and dramatic organization of the elimination of a fringe of overpopulation. And the whole process is supposed to be bringing the most intense pleasure to the participants. We can then compare this with all the executions of human beings in humanity still practiced here and there. The death penalty aims in the same way at purifying society through some ignominious and horrifying practice, rite or crime. Long live war, preemptive or not ! But we would miss, if we stopped there, the great loop of symbolical and parabolical meaning that starts at the very beginning with the purchasing of the right to cross the forest with the exchange of three fish against one tapir leg, then the pregnant woman who must run away from killers and be saved from a flood, to finally end with the reunification of the primary family and its two sons who go back into the forest to start all over again from scratch while another ferocious band of invaders is arriving who will be just as blood-thirsty as the local one for unacceptable reasons that have been explained and exposed in many books of the time. Adam and Eve leave with Abel and Cain to reinvent life. But the human curse is looming high in the two brothers and the myth they are referring to. Here Mel Gibson tells us humanity is nothing but a long history of horrors that constantly repeats itself. Only the forms and the dressings may change.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Apocalypto

MILLION DOLLAR BABY, for instance, actually had me laughing out loud.) How many actors, given their druthers, would insist on subtitles? (Eastwood followed suit with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, but that's another review...)

56,johnnyboyz,"Mad as you like; unlike anything you've seen before and a sort of pinnacle in exploitation genre film making hybridised with something more, Apocalypto is a blast.",8,10 February 2013,"The Mel Gibson bandwagon of pain, misery and torture rolls on with Apocalypto; a quite stunning two hour plus quasi-exploitation film in a language close-to-all but dead springing surprises and taking you places few films that you've previously seen will have done. What with his semi-directorial input on 1999's production dogged Payback and, by comparison, his Oscar winning efforts for 1995's Braveheart; Gibson has shifted from putting himself through wringers of strife, sadism and oppression and decided to transpire it unto others: but where does one go from Jesus Christ in 2004's The Passion of the Christ? Why, to the ancient pre-colonial South American cultures of the Mayans, of course. In the nicest possible way, film is bonkers; a jungle-set, ancient civilisation depicting two and a half hour mean machine of chase, adventure, peril and aggressive plot twists forcing your complete and undivided attention as it goes to places you've already reassured yourself they'll not dare tread anywhere near in the first place, before going beyond them further-still.First and foremost, I would disagree with those who criticise the film for being vacant or empty; those who might pull the film up for coming across as too exploitative or violent for the sake of violence. I always got the sense that this was a piece of cinema; a piece of film making first and foremost, something with a craft to it - a series of deft poetic touches applied to a narrative that has before been told but in a setting rarely before depicted. Take the scene much nearer the end when a trap in the jungle has been sprung; the little trigger item flies up into the air, falls to the ground into some dirt with a muddy splash and all to a sort of balletic slow motion as some kind of chanting native to these parts of the world doubles up as the musical overture to the thing being set off, impaling its prey and leaving the instigator there to admire their work. There's a sort of poetry to the whole thing; a sense of grace and timing in the editing and use of sound, something which elevates it a bit above what people a keen to dismiss it as.The film follows Rudy Youngblood's Mayan tribesperson Jaguar Paw, a young and handsome man who cuts a different figure to most others in his village with his leaner figure and unabashed attitude. He has a wife and a child, with another one on the way and is part of a small community of those whom descend from generations of Mayan people always occupying this very specific jungle stretch. It is Jaguar and his fellow tribesmen who open the film with a dramatic hunting sequence wherein a wild animal falls afoul of their tried and tested techniques designed to gore and incapacitate prey. Thereafter, they feast on their kill with an immediate effect; devouring the vital organs and convincing the fall-guy of the party to gorge on the animals testicles. When he does so, it tastes gross, and ends up being the one part of it you don't want to eat: but with everything else being shared around, was he to even know? Were indeed we? It is from this opening Gibson drops us into this universe where, quite literally, anything goes whereas all is both what it often seems as well as being capable of being the polar opposite.Teeing things up for the near future, the group meet a gang of battered refugees who speak of a recent attack on their settlement by outsiders; an attack that has left their numbers few and their present state homeless. This trouble eventually arrives at Jaguar Paw's community, a chaotic and unsettling sequence initiating the film proper and the misadventure our lead will find themselves undertaking. The film is so much of so many things, and yet like nothing that has preceded it with half the thrill in enjoying all of this content meld together and work. The mountainous death march back to the aggressors own settlement that plays out calls to mind the leaner, meaner Westerns of yerster-year. Its final act again calls upon elements from source texts of old, predominantly that of 1980s action films wherein the lead's body would be subjected to a harsh and unabashed testing against the elements as they prove themselves to a loved one or family member, often as they strive to rescue them against overwhelming numbers.For all its material and the territory it covers, the film is surprisingly subtle. Its depiction of these people who liquidate Jaguar Paw's village as those with their own city-like settlement, and of being more advanced in the field of modernity, offers both us and the lead character a fleeting moment away from all the mayhem to pause and reflect: they possess skills in silk production; their cooking and cuisine techniques dwarf our own characters' primal hunt/feast mentality whilst they even seem to actually launder their clothing. The film hits the marks on mostly every level; emotionally, we're involved and care for these characters while the piece has a charged visceral quality throughout, the kind that is rare in modern action films.",Apocalypto
57,filipemanuelneto,"I wasn't a fan, but I recognize that it's a great movie.",9,24 October 2019,"I just saw this movie and, honestly, I'm not sure what to think. It didn't particularly captivate me, but I recognize the quality of what I just saw.The film addresses the theme of the end of Mayan civilization, and is effective in the way it does. The film takes realism and historical credibility seriously, and that was a plus. The use of an Amerindian-sounding language - which I do not know if exists or was created for the film - fits that gamble. It is not a movie for all tastes - and I am the living proof of it, as I did not particularly like it - nor for any audience, as it exhibits a lot of tribal nudity, violent murder, blood and violence. It had to be, if they wanted to show the Maya as they really were: a cruel people, who appeased their gods through the systematic and violent killing of entire populations of neighboring tribes.Mel Gibson is a good actor and, with time and accumulated experience, has become a good director. In this movie, he used everything he learned and, in fact, offers us an exceptional spectacle. I don't know if it will be worth talking about the actors, because no known name appears on the poster (the bet on realism has reached that point). Rudy Youngblood is the name of the actor who plays the main character, Jaguar's Paw, but we don't see this movie for the quality of the cast. Cinematography is amazing, it makes excellent use of the colors (the truly green woods, the colorful body paintings and tattoos), keeps up a good pace even in pursuit and high tension scenes. The soundtrack is equally excellent and uses very well the sounds we are used to associating with the South American tribal universe.Do I really need to say that this movie should absolutely not be seen by children or impressionable people? I don't think so, do you? Although I don't feel much about this movie, it is definitely a great movie and deserves to be seen at least once in a lifetime.",Apocalypto
58,TheMovieDiorama,Apocalypto may lack an involving narrative but impresses with technical astuteness.,7,24 February 2018,"Not often I watch a film that utilises an uncommon language...in fact this is probably the first. The dialogue extensively consists of Yucatan Maya and is used brilliantly to recreate a once great civilisation. It depicts the journey of a Mesoamerican hunter named Jaguar Paw whose entire tribe is mercilessly slaughtered and captured. They traverse the rural jungle and become prisoners to an almost civilised Mayan city who's culture and ideologies consist of ritual sacrifices. You see that 18 rating on the cover? Yeah, justified. This is relentlessly savage. I'm no expert on Mayan civilisation but the primal depiction and bloody savagery was completely believable. There's one scene that consists of beheading prisoners and letting the heads roll down the stairs of a colossal temple. Beautifully disgusting. There's only one director crazy enough to pull off this, Mel Gibson. Say what you want, there is no denying that he can direct the heck out of a film. His artistic integrity and attention to detail is one that allows films like this and 'Passion of the Christ' to be aimed towards mainstream audiences. The indigenous cast was revelatory and all of them took to their roles whilst preventing it from looking like a cosplay. The makeup and costumes oozed authenticity, some of those ear and nose piercings were eye watering! The chase sequences were adrenaline fuelled and well executed also. The major problem is the story, it's far too basic. It started off well, establishing character hierarchy within the tribe and how they interact with each other. Then Gibson chooses to focus on the savagery at an expense of losing the character focus. The third act literally consists of running with minimal dialogue, it's a tonal shift that didn't work. Think of it as 'Home Alone' but in a 16th Century jungle. Having said that, all the technical aspects outweigh the weak narrative to create a visceral artistic vision that is not for the faint hearted. Too many cut out hearts in one film...",Apocalypto
59,Tweetienator,Brilliant,9,9 March 2021,"Like The Passion of the Christ (2004), Apocalypto is a fantastic and unique movie and proof that Mel Gibson is besides a good actor also a very capable director. I might add, that both belong to my top 100 list for sure. Yes, Braveheart already was a very good movie, but with his interpretation of the passion of Christ and with his story about the Mayan kingdom, he topped that pretty good one easy. The Passion and Apocalypto belong in my opinion to the best of the best movies made after 2k. Gibson more or less tells us an old story, that of fight of survival and of revenge, but set in an most impressive setting and production and told with a very natural pace and direction. Apocalypto is top edge cinema, and only because the story told is a little to conventional at its core, I rate 9 and not 10.",Apocalypto

The story is refreshing. The casting of the actors is nicely put together. However, there are many continuity errors and they use deus ex machina too much to make things happen. I can let a few of them slide, just because it would be difficult to make things happen with out it, but they are face-palm scenes.I won't bother nitpicking anything else, but the one item which really bothers me is that this is supposed to take place in the 12th century. At that time the gods of the era were different. While they got one of the god names right, the era was wrong.I also didn't care for the eclipse scene. It moves along too fast. Total eclipses from start to finish take more time than this one did, plus, there were no eclipses in the 12 century over Mexico. There was one near Arizona and Mexico, but it is in the wrong location.Sigh.

63,jzappa,Simply Exploitation,8,18 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is directed with intense realism. Its extended scenes of horrific, primal violence, consisting mostly of brute force and barehanded or large-wooden-club-sporting savagery, are what make the film a stunner. Apocalypto isn't just a violent movie. It is violence. That's what the movie is about. Gibson gives no real insight into the Mayan civilization at all except for its barbaric violence. The violence is what drives the story. The hunt at the beginning is an explicit and unbearable portrayal of a tribe's nonchalance towards violence, then the rape and pillaging of their land raises the blunt and extensive violence to a higher level, and as the story progresses, the violence becomes a different sort, a more ritualistic and otherworldly attitude behind it. It gets fairly interesting, yes, but on the level that an R-rated movie was when you were a child and your parents didn't let you see it. You wanted to see it because the ominous violence that is apparently too violent to watch is alluring on a basic animal level.What I thought was criminal was the aforementioned animal violence. I am a hard-core animal lover, and I support all movements in animal rights and justice. Your typical human view towards animals in general is horrible. The fact that humans see themselves as so far above other animals, even such deep and emotionally receptive ones, makes them possibly one of the least noble types of animals. The fact that Gibson, as it seems with every film he directs, sees animals as things you can just shoot or torture or mistreat in any way without feeling for it, is pathetic. There is a hunt that I've mentioned at the beginning that petrifies me at the explicit showcasing of the animal's helpless screams of fright and pain before its gory, humiliating, and very unpleasant demise. There are several animals in the film that die savage, brutal deaths. If you're going to stop reading this review because you feel you can't trust the opinion of someone so biased towards animals, or someone you view as a sob sister or an overzealous activist type, go ahead and keep your mind from being open. I'm just going to keep on writing about the rest of my feelings towards the film. I guess you close-minded, proud, muscle-flexers will just have to miss out on my beautiful semantic grace.The story itself is an action story, something Gibson would've starred in earlier in his career, only it's shot in Mexico rather than a backlot, and it is given a flimsy disguise as a study of the Mayan culture by having each actor speak in Mayan tongues.",Apocalypto
64,FiendishDramaturgy,"Historically Flawed, But Wonderfully Done.",8,16 April 2008,"Historically, there are myriad inaccuracies, but who cares? Apocalypto is a ""guy"" movie, with savagery from start to finish. Found therein are a plethora of chases, escapes, challenges, crude humor, the arts of manhood and war, intrigues, sacrifices, natives, epic deaths, near naked women, honor, principles, valor, true love, and, severed-head bowling.Gibson may be one confused, lost, little man, but Apocalypto never fails to entertain. There are few slow moments, with action or distraction with every step. The film is shot closely, saving the epic style for the last 1/3 of the work, which made it all the more enjoyable, to me. It does not take itself too seriously, yet doesn't go so far as to wink at us, either. The subject matter is VERY serious, while the film itself somehow manages to impart some level of entertainment even while it shocks us by giving us what we expect from this particular civilization.All in all? It's a good Friday/Saturday night movie, but the gals may not like it. It is very bloody, though not nearly as bloody as Sweeny Todd.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Apocalypto
65,Chris Knipp,"More violence, greater speed, a relieving detachment",8,12 December 2006,"Apocalypto is the final entry in Gibson's declared ""Ordeal"" trilogy  Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ being the first two. But does anyone seriously think he's going to switch to romantic comedy? He clearly revels in gore, and he is a master showman in its exploitation.Apocalypto's dialogue is in a version of Yucatec, the Maya language, but spoken by Americans and Mexicans, stiltedly, slowly. Despite elaborate temples, terrifying bloodthirsty rituals, naked crowds of painted bodies (some corpse-like, à la Apocalypse Now's final Mistah Kurtz Heart of Darkness sequence), men draped in feathers and bones with ornate, threatening coiffures and bristling with piercings, naked muscle and nasty looks, it doesn't feel authentic. This is due most of all to the use of a mixture of non-Mayan actors in the leads, as well as the focus only on the most aspects of Maya culture, which aren't rendered quite accurately. There were no mass killings of captives or mass graves, according to historians; nor are captive slaves known to have been used as laborers or sacrificial victims. It is also inaccurate to imply that the civilization of the Maya was in major decline right when the Spanish arrived in the sixteenth century; the greatest decline occurred centuries earlier. One doesn't want to think about how the Maya people of today will greet this purely sadistic version of their ancestors, who had one of the most highly developed of stone age cultures.But that doesn't keep Gibson's story from being involving. Eventually in the rush of violent action, you forget this is a somewhat dubious (and perhaps to real descendants of the culture referred to, offensive) fabrication. In some sense that doesn't matter, because what feels authentic ultimately is the gore. When the high priest cuts the heart out of a sacrificial victim, it seems like a reasonable facsimile.The film-making craft is good enough so you feel like you're up there, panting with exhaustion and dizzy with terror. The teeming crowd, the bound and scarred captives, their sweat and their fear and their heavy, terrified breathing, seem pretty real.Then comes the sudden and brief solar eclipse that scares the hierophants so they stop the sacrifices  a narrative device said to be nicked from a Tintin episode  and this leads to a private Roman coliseum-like event. The captives, though not to be sacrificed, are still to be got rid of, by having them run toward the forest while dodging spears and arrows. Faster and craftier and stronger-willed than the others, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the hero, begins a long flight pursued by the evil slave drivers.This chase au naturel  no Mini-Coopers, no helicopters, only snakes, panthers, hornet nests, inky black swamps, breathtaking waterfalls, and body-piercing arrows and spears  staged at breathtaking speed and seamlessly edited, takes on a pure kinetic energy. There is no point in this prolonged flight and pursuit sequence, but it's the part of the movie that is least distracting and most successful. As actioner stuff, it's superb, a triumph of simple but highly accomplished film-making. It has such energy and sweep the violence is absorbed into it.Gibson's violence is the primitive kind  were Auschwitz, Dresden, or Hiroshima less sadistic? If this is human nature, shouldn't we look at it up close? I find myself defending Gibson's use of it because I saw beauty in this exhilarating flight, perhaps since I have always loved running, and have been a longtime runner myself. In a sense JP, AKA, Rudy, is running away from all the nauseating violence, as we would surely like to do. The sequence captures the pure joy of escape from all personal problems and social pressures a distance runner momentarily feels, the sense of freedom and invincibility, the natural high. I would not defend the violence of The Passion of the Christ. In his previous ""Ordeals"" Gibson was evoking some sort of personal Celtic roots, and delving into some sadistic version of his neo-con Christianity. Here the action is at a further remove from him and from me. Surely the Maya at point of decline are used only as a pretext. And that seems wrong, but it displaces our discomfort.Youngblood is lithe as a jaguar, but as important, he has a pure, innocent face with wide-open, eager eyes. He's a kind of Noble Savage, ready for the ""new beginning"" (the meaning of 'apocalypto' in Greek) he speaks to his wife of after he rescues her.Gibson's finale has what could be interpreted as a subconscious note of obvious racism: Jaguar's pursuers drop him at the seaside when the sight the Conquistadors' waiting ships, as if to say the big guys have arrived  our little stuff doesn't matter any more. This is a dramatic moment, but as mentioned, it is ahistorical. No persons of Maya descent were used for main roles, I understand. Youngblood is an American of Indian, Hispanic, and African-American heritage; his original family name was Gonzalez. The early scenes in Apocalypto are terrible. The actors are too big, they aren't Maya, they're too different from each other. Jaguar Paw's wife (Dalia Hernandez) looks Spanish. The sexual teasing of the soon-to-be captured forest hunter tribesmen is excruciatingly crude and corny at the same time. It's really embarrassing. It's only when the violence begins that Gibson is in his element and the movie becomes bearable, at first hard to watch (the captures, the trek to the Maya capital, the sacrifices, the sadistic glee of the leading slaver), and then compelling (the chase, which is like a native American marathon). Then one's left flat, with a portentous moment for which one was unprepared, like the end of an episode of Planet of the Apes.",Apocalypto

The next day, the hunters village is attacked, and their huts set on fire. He escapes with his pregnant wife and son during the murderous rampage. On the journey he encounters victims of the plague, and a dying little girl predicts a solar eclipse which will begin the end times. Slave laborers work in lime quarries and women are sold off for sex. Human sacrifices are common and the bloody violence is over the top; Mr. Gibson has an extremely sadistic streak. Highly symbolic, with snakes, jaguars, and the eclipse of the sun, make Apocalypto a feast for the eyes. Mel is a racist ass**** in real life, but he is a talented director.",Apocalypto
67,thinker1691,""" Beware; The Jaguar Man brings you to your death """,8,15 July 2007,"For the most part, the people of Central America have only a handful of motion pictures created with them in mind. However, when one does arrive, attention should be given. This film, "" Apocalypto "" is perhaps one of the best I've ever seen. The Director, brilliant film star in his own right, has written, directed and produced what may become a milestone for the film industry. The story is taken from the ladder part of the 15th century and is set in a provincial part of what will later be called, Guatemala. Here a small, friendly tribe of indigenous Indians, are invaded by their war-like brethren from an area near Tenochtitlan in the North. Unlike them, the invaders are brutal headhunters who seek to enslave most of their captives and offer the rest as blood sacrifices to their Sun God. One of the many prisoners taken in the raid, is called Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) it is he who becomes the focus of the horrendous expedition to the city of stone. What terrifying experiences our hero and his people are confronted with is the stuff of historical Codices, later found by scholars. The film's core is a combination of familiar themes, namely, ' The Naked Prey, 'The Runing Man,' and 'Marathon Man.' Nevertheless, it's overall content is educationally pleasing to historians and history teachers alike. Coversely, it's dramatic entertainment is superb! ****",Apocalypto
68,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,30 November 2020,"Let's be honest, almost all of the 1 star reviews are because of how the Mayan's are depicted and stem from a lack of historical knoweldge.There seems to be the misconception that the Mayans were peaceful and didn't sacrifice humans... which reminds me of when my wife and I went to visit her family in Guatemala where the high point was really watching the American tourists swim in pools of water that probably had the bodies of thousands of sacrificial victims at the bottom... mostly 14 year-old boys.Yeah, no way I would get in that water, but then I know what's beneath it.Apocaypto is kind of about that... but it doesn't really convey the fact that, like the rest of Central and South America the sacrifice was to prevent the end of the world... and this kind of makes it about drought (which hit about the time they made contact with the west)And it really doesn't convey the culture very well... but it does seem to zero in on the point that it wasn't their own people they were sacrificing, it was the people removed from the cities, the people that fell under the Mayan Empire, but weren't exactly a part of it...... which is what the Aztecs did too.But, who cares, in the end it's a brutal fight for survival, and it's an entertaining one.",Apocalypto
69,freemantle_uk,Gibson adds the Mayans to his list of hate,7,14 May 2008,"Apocalypto is Mel Gibson's best directed film, but considering I hated Braveheart and the Passion of the Christ, it's not saying much from me.Apocalypto is film based on the decline of the Mayan empire in the 16th Century. The film starts showing the life of people in a small village in the jungle, showing the men hunting and the women taking care of the village and the children. However, the village is destroyed after a raid by warriors who kill and kidnap most of the villagers. The people who are kidnapped are forced on a gruelling march to the main city. Once they arrive at the city the villagers discovery that it was suffering from famine and disease. Many people were dead or dying. The city's elders try to solve the crisis by doing a number of public sacrifices. However, one of the villages, Jaguarpaw, was able to escape and goes back to the village to save his wife and child. But he is also being chased by the warriors.Apocalypto is typical of Gibson's work, it is very violence, but he able to tone it down a little since the over the top violence in Passion of the Christ. The history that it is based on is very dubious. The story itself is simple but is based on a controversial theory about the fall of the Mayans. The film is not a masterpiece, but it's alright.I personally think those that Mel Gibson has a list of groups he wants to insult. He properly went that the English, the British as a whole, the Jews, ooo the Mayans. I wouldn't be surprised that his next film project would either be a bio-pic of Hitler in a sympathetic light or Stalin the Musical.",Apocalypto
70,Polaris_DiB,American Extreme,7,20 December 2007,"So, to use a colloquial my friends have picked up recently, ""I'm not gonna lie,"" but I'm liking Mel Gibson's new emphasis on the hyper-violence and gore, even though I like it more in theory than what it often turns into. To be quite direct, I view ""The Passion of the Christ"" as a fascinating exercise in horror cinema, featuring as it does torture, gore, creepy children, demons jumping out of shadows, Satanic inclinations...""Apocalypto"" follows up directly to ""Passion"" in many ways, some less obvious than others. There's the violence, the use of dead languages, the focus on human suffering and literally Apocalyptic futures... there's also the anachronistic scatological humor, a surprising ecological message, and lesser stated emphases on mob-mentality like spectatorship of ritual, violence, and violent ritual. These are not confined to the two movies, either... take the time to watch ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"" (the latter not directed by Mel, but produced by him), and you'll see a lot of the same techniques.However, there is something to be said in questioning the worth of some of the things Gibson does. Many people attribute it to his Catholicism, many to him being crazy, but the man likes piling suffering up on his characters to a point at which eventually it even becomes dull. I remember watching ""The Passion of the Christ"" and thinking that it could have used one less moment of Jesus collapsing under the cross--Apocalypto could almost be called ""Mayan rennt"", as Gibson never lets the main character stop for a breath without making something else cause him more suffering. This movie honestly does serve a lot of the same techniques as ""Run, Lola, Run,"" in that it's basically an experiment in the many different ways in editing together someone running for his life through a jungle.By the time Jaguar Paw finally is allowed to stop, face his competitors, and fight back, relief is felt in the fact that finally something less trial-and-suffering based is occurring and the character finally has some room in the story to move around and make decisions. Unfortunately, this moment occurs roughly in the last eighth of the movie, and doesn't really last that long. Instead, Gibson is much more interested in building incredibly intricate and full historical set-pieces so that he can cut out more hearts than the priest in the Temple of Doom could ever imagine... and then some.I find it fascinating, but then again I have a particular sense of humour where I watch blood spray from a head-wound and think that Gibson has finally found his money shot. I couldn't honestly say what other people see in this--at least ""Passion"" had the excuse of being a religious creation (arguable to some, but the movie sold tickets in bulk to church groups everywhere), and I guess I admit that this is an almost pure form of action/adventure story, but the mood of it all is so outside what typically people find acceptable that I'm having a hard time seeing why they have the patience for this, but I can't convince them to watch a good Korean horror film once in a while ""because it has subtitles."" Anyway, I eagerly await what fleshy still-beating dish Gibson is going to serve us next, but I also recognize that there's only so far he can take it before I think people will get a little tired of the whole conceit.--PolarisDiB",Apocalypto
71,dfranzen70,"Not quite epicular, but grand",7,27 June 2007,"In Mel Gibson's searing look at familial love and the declining dominance of Mayan civilizations, a hunter-gatherer tribe is raided in the middle of the night by a warrior tribe, and its surviving males are taken to the Mayan city to be sacrificed to the gods as a way to end drought. One of the men, Jaguar Paw, must escape and make his way back to his pregnant, trapped wife and their young son.In all honesty, if Mel Gibson's name hadn't been attached to this movie, if there hadn't been so much attention paid to the film because of its violence level, its big budget, its on-location shooting, and its reliance on the ancient Mayan language, this might have been another largely forgotten film set in a foreign land during an indeterminate time period.The violence is very brutal and jarring (114 on-screen deaths), but that's as it should be. Gibson doesn't want us to view the tribulations of this particular tribe as disinterested souls watching a Hollywood blockbuster, he wants us to understand how perilous every aspect of their lives was, how strong they needed to be, both physically and mentally, and how important one's family and friends can be.The beginning scenes had me a little skeptical, because the comedy was a little broad. How broad, you ask? The tribesmen make mother-in-law jokes. No, I'm serious. There's a nagging old hag who keeps haranguing her son in law about making a grandbaby for her, and he's impotent. Oh, and there's a bit about someone getting tricked into rubbing a painful ointment onto his private parts. You know, intellectual humor.But that quickly dissipates, as the tattooed, bejeweled, and totally armed-and-dangerous warriors attack, beating, slaying, and torturing the members and putting the entire hamlet to the torch. Jaguar Paw, who'd dreamed of the attack, awakens just as the intruders arrive and is able to stow his wife and child at the bottom of a pit. This safety is somewhat short lived, however, when one of the warriors notices the rope that was to allow them to escape the pit - and cuts it off.Don't watch this if you can't stand women in peril, or if you can't stand watching people sacrificed to the gods. Come to think of it, the woman-in-peril bit is just a mask - turns out that Jaguar Paw's wife, Seven, is extremely tough, inside and out, and her resilience and fortitude give her and her child a fighting chance.The focus is on Jaguar Paw, though, and how he gains almost superhuman abilities as he dodges headhunters and wild animals in his quest to return to his loved ones. That might sound implausible, but as most parents know that when your child's health is in jeopardy, it's possible to do things you never thought you could do.I don't see this as quite the epic that Gibson was going for, but his directorial touches lend quite a bit of panache and anxiety to the proceedings. Some of the action shots of Jaguar Paw running through his beloved forest, pursued by bad men, are seamless, jaw-dropping views, allowing us to figure out Jaguar Paw's on-the-fly plans right after he does. Gibson's style, along with the cinematography of Dean Selmer and the performance by Rudy Youngblood keep this movie afloat; the conclusion, while lacking the intensity of the rest of the movie, is satisfying.",Apocalypto
72,kevin_robbins,This is a brilliant picture that is a must see,10,8 November 2021,"Apocalypto (2006) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a Central American tribe during the time of the Aztecs. One inauspicious day they come across another wandering tribe fleeing deeper into the forest. Why have they come now and what are they fleeing from? This movie is directed by Mel Gibson (Braveheart) and stars Gerardo Taracena (Man on Fire), Raoul Max Trujillo (The New World), Rudy Youngblood (Attrition) and Jonathan Brewer (Hyde-Park Hudson). The storyline for this is so unique, intricate and well told. I loved the boar hunt opening and the dynamics within the village. Each character's depth and dynamics are well established and the dialogue is a healthy mix of comedy and intensity. The circumstances are unbelievably good and the build up to the point of the story followed by the escape is action packed and unpredictable. The fight scenes are excellent, savage and gory. There are some unforgettable all times great scenes from the temple, the Jaguar, the waterfall and I could go on and on. This is a brilliant picture that is a must see and an easy 10/10.",Apocalypto
73,MBunge,Don't expect more than a Mayan action flick,7,9 March 2011,"The only thing wrong with Apocalypto is expectation. If you look at it as a foreign language movie from a South American filmmaker, it'll seem marvelous. If you think of it as the movie that followed an Academy Award winning director's most provocative work ever, you'll find it a bit disappointing. If you think of it as being from the mind of Mel Gibson, you probably won't bother with it.Set in the dying days of the Mayan civilization, give or take a few historical inaccuracies, this story is about a young hunter named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood). As his jungle tribe is assaulted by Mayan raiders, Jaguar Paw barely manages to hide his wife and child in a deep pit before he and all the other men and women of the village are taken prisoner. They are trekked across the rain forest with another captive tribe until they reach a Mayan city. Jaguar Paw must survive human sacrifice, becoming target practice for the Mayan raiders and one of the longest foot chases in movie history to return home and rescue his wife and child, who became trapped in the pit as it filled with water.I say expectation is the only thing wrong with Apocalypto because in almost every respect, this is quite a good film. The acting, writing and direction are top notch. Emotionally, it's exciting, terrifying and touching. Even thought all the dialog is spoken in Mayan or some other ancient South American dialect, it doesn't create any barrier to getting involved in this story.As fine a work as it is, Apocalypto is nothing more than a basic adventure story. It's like The Outlaw Josey Wales or some other Western-style tale of survival and revenge, except all the characters are really, really tan and wearing loin cloths. If a thousand years ago there had been a Mayan version of Hollywood, this is exactly the sort of summer action movie it would have turned out. Unfortunately, when you're watching the film, you can't escape the sense it should be more than that.The only thing this movie has to say about the Mayans is that they wore a cloak of civilization over a primitive and savage heart. This story is full of brutality and violence and Man's indifference to the suffering of his fellow Man. But though you can clearly see signs throughout the movie that Mayan society is falling apart, absolutely nothing is said about why that's happening. The Mayans are shown to be much more culturally and technologically advanced that Jaguar Paw's jungle folk, but they're beset by famine and plague. There's never any effort, though, to explain or explore if the Mayans are declining due to luck, fate or bad decisions.None of that would ordinarily be a problem but after Mel Gibson makes The Passion of the Christ, you can't help but expect him to do something more than just make a really good action flick about ancient South Americans. If you're going to go to all of the trouble to make a movie about the Mayans, to the extent you do it in the native languages, why bother with all of that for a story about a guy who turns into a jungle hybrid of Chuck Norris and MacGuyver?I'd definitely encourage you to rent Apocalypto, just don't expect anything deep, profound or enlightening.",Apocalypto
74,Chris_Docker,At once brilliant and narrow-minded,4,7 January 2007,"What can you say about a film that has so many hallmarks of greatness but is so lacking in judgement? Since the early days of film, when DW Griffith made Birth of a Nation, that dilemma has haunted cinema-goers and critics alike. Griffith's film told the story the beginnings of the United States of America, a momentous piece of history, technically the most ambitious film ever made at that time, and also pioneering so many cinematic techniques as to revolutionise the industry. It had one flaw. The director's narrowness of vision. Griffith related the entire genesis through a lens of racial hatred, projecting his own idea that blacks were the root of all evil, and also promoting the Klu Klux Klan.Mel Gibson's groundbreaking movie is neither as great nor as sickening as Griffith's masterpiece, but it similarly projects small-mindedness onto a breathtaking palette. True to his penchant for proving you can make a blockbuster using subtitles, Gibson has followed his Passion of the Christ with this film set in ancient Mayan culture and in original language. Filmed largely in the jungle and using a mostly indigenous and inexperienced cast, to pull off a major film under such conditions in no small feat.Jungle Paw is a young tribal warrior, a member of a community in the Central American jungle. The film follows a fairly standard three-act story that has been a mainstay of Westerns, Spy stories and Alien adventures: hero gets captured, has a terrible time in an enemy camp, and then escapes to larger-than-life adventure to get back to loving, sexy wife. In Hollywood tradition, Apocalypto is action-driven, and wastes no time lingering on the beauties of the forest.What is worrying, and makes it gripping if not exactly entertaining, is the extended, gratuitous violence almost from beginning to end. In Braveheart, the violence was excused by a stirring tale that won the hearts of every nation except perhaps the English; in Passion of the Christ it might just be excused by those that embraced Gibson's view of Christianity. But in Apocalypto it serves no purpose other than to shock and sensationalise, and with the deliberate intent to demonise the Mayan people. Never mind achievements like urban planning, writing, mathematics, astronomy and art, we are constantly reminded that these are savages whose brutality is their eventual downfall.Could it be that we are back in a very early period? Apparently not, for all the messing with chronology, the Spanish arrive and so clearly place the story in the 16th century. The film would have us believe that Mayan culture was self-imploding - convenient, as the film doesn't mention that the invaders brought diseases which wiped out ninety percent of remaining Mayans. But then, Behold! For hidden in the credits is The Key to It All! The film is dedicated 'to Abel'! The whole of Mayan civilisation has been neatly extrapolated from a Biblical story and what we really need to do is get back to the Garden (along with Jaguar's family - who aren't warmongering - just stupid).For most people, Apocalypto is a thrilling enough, exotic enough, and gut-churningly visceral enough not to ask fine questions about offensive racial stereotyping. It will grab too many headlines for many people to worry about how it sets us back light years in terms of cultural sensitivity or understanding different world views. Some people may well question the addiction to prolonged violence and torture that seems to be the main goal of the film. Some may even wonder if it is an expression of Gibson's seemingly troubled persona. Others will just say to hell with it and hand out an award.",Apocalypto

76,Cristi_Ciopron,"A gruesome, chilling triptych",9,23 February 2009,"Content—wise, Gibson's hit has three parts:--the first one resembles, after the prologue, a Way of the Cross; the second is the peak of the evil, cruelty and violence; the third one is Rambo romance. And they are pretty distinct; I liked best the 2nd one—the events in the city. There Gibson makes the evilness tangible.There is a tangible and chilling sense of the characters approaching the core of the evil, the summit of all evil. Gibson, our Bosch and Grünewald, handles amazingly this road, and with a richness of telling, significant details that boost the story and give it an unbelievable compactness.Where did this director so extremely able of noticing and depicting things stay hidden for so long? Where did he learn his trade? Gibson scores again as master of the portrayal—physical as well as moral—and more notably moral. Also he deepens a peculiar atmosphere of violence and savagery and cruelty, in the line of the realist icons made five centuries ago.Gibson might be our Bosch, our Grűnewald, the explorer and exposer of the cruelty, evil and violence.Now that a pattern is discernible in the movies directed by Gibson, we could say that he not only chooses the means according to the subjects, but also picks certain subjects to fit his means—as the Way of the Cross comes back in this movie, as a pattern, it seems that Gibson is mostly attracted by some traits—like the physical abuse, etc., therefore intelligently choosing subjects to whom these traits fit. In the mutual interdependence between shape and content, or means and subject, it looks like the shape gets the first word and decides upon the content. But Gibson takes his movies way beyond exploitation, of course; striking depictions of evil, they also feature a sharp emotional intensity, a rawness of the emotions that surprises positively. It seems plausible that a certain penchant for the representation of gory violence determines the content of Gibson's movies; it is simultaneously true that they are on another level than that of the exploitation.",Apocalypto
77,Kdosda_Hegen,Hardcore.,9,21 May 2020,"Absolutely terrifying experience. One of the most gruesome films I've seen.It is a film about ""hunt or be hunted"", but it is done in probably the most hardcore and brutal way. It is so cruel that I was shocked. This film hit me very strong on the emotional levels, for the most part it was hard to watch. This film deeply explores the themes of hatred, revenge, natural selection, primal fear, being behind enemy lines, environmental usage, endless cycles of violence, religion, symbolism (literraly) and a lot more. There is countless symbolism usages both obvious and very subtle, this film does ""show, don't tell"" a lot. Also, not only the message is deep, but the execution on technical levels is also very impressive. Cinematography is spectacular and so are the action scenes.As amazing as this film is, I have a few nitpicks, like, it would be better without any humor in the beginning, it felt like sitcom quality jokes. Also ending is quite underwhelming, I don't think that being ambiguous works the best for this film.",Apocalypto

79,TdSmth5,Fascinating,9,11 December 2006,"Some of the reviews out there by the ""critics"" are surprising. A violent blood orgy? Non-stop action? It's none of these. Apocalypto is a drama with some great action. Is there blood and violence? Sure and unfortunately some of it involves animals. But Gibson always aims at realism in his movies. So a movie about aborigenes will obviously be violent. This movie isn't sanitized for a PG rating. People are dirty, brutal, and violent. They were back then and are still now. But the violence here is nothing compared to movies like Hostel, Saw, Michael Bay horror movies. It's not a non-stop action chase movie either. That's only the last third of the movie or so. Most importantly, Gibson transports us to the fascinating world of these people and presents us astonishing sights. As is typical for a Gibson film, the story centers on one man's life and struggles with injustice as he is separated from his family. Some of the scenes are remarkable. There is one gorgeous jaguar chase scene wherein the majesty of that animal will leave you breathless- that scene is worth the price of admission alone. Kudos go to the casting, costumes, effects, and actors. The Mayan high class world is utterly interesting as we meet oracles, priests, princesses- all actors and actresses with unforgettable faces. A culture at it's zenith but in some trouble as well but paranoid and attempting to recover its stability with blood and violence. The parallels to the current US empire are transparent. This movie is Gibson's statement on the post 9/11 era, where hubris and paranoia collude, where appearances of superiority betray a rotten core, and where zeal has deafened those in power to hear the warnings of an obvious impending doom. Apocalypto is the kind of movie that you won't easily forget.",Apocalypto
80,fertilecelluloid,Bloody exploitation on a grand scale and budget,8,9 December 2006,"This is a beautifully shot, adroitly directed, bloody, gory, rousing adventure epic set just before the end of the Mayan civilization when the first European boats started to arrive. For historians, it's probably of some use. For lovers of on-screen action and mayhem well cooked, it delivers the goods in spades. We get a nasty jaguar attack in which a man's face is ripped off; we get arrows shot through the backs of heads so they can burst through mouths Argento-style; we get severed heads rolled down the steps of a giant temple; we get implied rape; we get half a dozen death-defying leaps from a mammoth waterfall; we get a Mayan with gaping stomach predicting doom in a dream sequence; we get chase scenes filled with flying arrows and poison darts; we get blood spurting Baby Cart-style from a semi-scalped head; we get a pregnant native girl, a baby ripped brutally from its mother, an underwater birth, numerous stabbings, human sacrifice and some of the best head clubbings I've seen for quite a while. At times some sequences are a little protracted, but, when all is said and done, Melvin Gibson has crafted an exciting two hours plus of pure adventure that is not afraid to ladle on the grue.

81,aharmas,It's The End of the World,10,11 December 2006,"Gibson's epic has been criticized for its violence... necessary as it might be. It doesn't need to show the heights of culture and the cultural achievements of the Mayans. It's set in a time when things were at their worst, and it reflects how that once marvelous and mythical empire was about to be destroyed.The film contains several grand sequences, and they're all about how a single man gets involved in the political and religious decadence that now afflicts the empire. He manages to survive several ordeals and the impending threat of his own sacrifice to the very unhappy gods of his people. Eventually he travels back to his own territory, and the conflict takes on an interesting spin.The production values in the movie are top notch, with superb camera-work and a very effective score that for a change does not call attention to itself. The film has several scenes that are innovative and refreshing, reflective of a director that is willing to push himself extra hard to come up with a very kinetic project. There is not a single boring moment in this film, as the conflict is introduced, developed and eventual reaches its resolution.The film is an outstanding piece of work, showing us hints of what our world looked like before ""civilized"" Europeans came and instituted their own brand of savagery. It's an exercise in creative criticism, showing us how we are willing to reach both incredible heights and the lowest of the worst.",Apocalypto

Raiding parties are sent out into the surrounding jungle to capture men to sacrifice. One of those parties come to Jaguar Paw's village. The village is burnt and it's people marched of to the temples. Suddenly everything is a struggle to survive.Comments: This is not a nice movie. It is not very entertaining either. But that does not mean it is bad. Actually it is the other way around. It is an honest and brutal depiction of what humans can do to each other. What violence and cruelty can do and what conviction and love can make you accomplish.It gave me an uneasy feeling, mostly because that it didn't shy away from any uncomfortable scenes. Blood and death is present in abundance. But that also give the movie its honesty.The result is that it is not very nice to watch. This is not a movie that you watch to become happy, or enjoy at least. But it is very interesting and captivating none the less. It is not hard to keep watching for it's entire length. It is definitely worth to see, it is well done and tells a good tale. But choose your moment well, because this is not for everyone or anytime.6/10",Apocalypto
83,Jonny_Numb,"Lots of heart, but no pulse",4,28 December 2006,"It is odd how directors who employ aesthetic overstatement think that, by virtue of said overstatement, they are giving the viewer much more than they bargained for. In the case of Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto""--an excess of frenetic action, little plot, and even less insight--we get the equivalent of a repeated beating over the head with a blunt instrument (both literally and figuratively). It is a crass, stereotypical vision of tribal society dressed up with pseudo-philosophical posturing (omens, eclipses, and caves filling with rain thrown in like afterthoughts to the bloody onslaught)--imagine your typical Michael Bay actioner wrung through a historical filter, and you have ""Apocalypto."" While the film's excesses (which, in all honesty, aren't as excessive as most viewers are making them out to be) seem appropriate/indicative of the tribal culture at the time, Gibson appears to have a veiled motive in this, as he lavishes loving attention on mutilation and physical suffering (of both animal and man). Spielberg mined shock value out of having a man's heart torn out in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom""; in ""Apocalypto,"" hearts are cut out, severed heads are knocked down steep stairs, tapir testicles are consumed, and much more! As the film progresses, dragging out its conclusion to a nearly insufferable degree, the violence becomes absurdly comic (culminating in blood spraying rhythmically out of a head wound)...and by the time the Conquistadores wash ashore, the film has succumbed to self-parody and pretentiousness. Additionally, the characters are ill-defined and the tribal culture presented in a stereotypical manner: the 'good' tribesmen have tasteful jewelry, good oral hygiene, and minimal tattoos; the 'bad' tribesmen have excessive, tacky jewelry, poor oral hygiene, scary tattoos, and huge gauges through their noses and ears. In an ironic moment of unintended dual symbolism, our hero emerges from quicksand, doused in dark mud and bearing an uncanny resemblance to a blackface performer from the early 20th century. Gibson ultimately turns a potentially interesting subject into nothing more than a cultural freak show where depth of character and plot is nothing compared to showing a still-beating heart cut out of its owner's chest.",Apocalypto
84,ShootingShark,Exciting But Formulaic Adventure Of Mayan Warrior's Race Against Time,5,9 July 2007,"Jaguar Paw is a Mayan tribesman in Central America whose village is attacked by a band of ruthless Holcane warriors. Jaguar Paw hides his wife and son, but is marched off to be sacrificed to appease the gods. Can he escape from his captors and reunite his family ?This is an ambitious, exciting, entertaining but for me also a slightly flawed movie. There aren't any films I know of that deal with the Mayan civilisation, so from that viewpoint it's got a great original punch, underlined by the cast of likable unknowns, the authentic Mexican locations (notably Veracruz and Oaxaca) and the Yucatec Mayan dialogue. It's a very physical film, particularly the final third, and there's a pumping viscerality to the action which is very effective. However, the story is so simple there's very little scope for character or subtext; Jaguar Paw is marched passed lots of Aztec culture, but we never really get to see much of it, or to explore anything other than the most primal and violent rituals. And whilst it's exciting, the action itself is pretty hokey - the gauntlet run, poison darts, quicksand, waterfall jumps and booby-traps are all familiar from a dozen Tarzan stories. There are similar films (Aguirre: Der Zorn Gottes, The Emerald Forest, The Last Of The Mohicans) which are just as eye-popping but also take the time to explore their savage cultures with more insight and subtlety. That said, it's still a very original picture and the cast all come off well, especially Taracena as the thoroughly nasty Middle-Eye, as sneaky and beady-eyed a villain as you could hope for. The best ingredient is Dean Semler's fantastic photography, which is arresting, fluid and elegant - he's probably the best cameraman Australia has ever produced. Don't miss his other movies, particularly Mad Max 2, which he made with Gibson twenty-five years earlier. Also featuring a nice jungle-drums score by James Horner, this is a captivating adventure, but also something of a missed opportunity.",Apocalypto

If you are a fan of Beowulf, 300, or The Lord of the Rings, then this movie should definitely be on your list of must-sees.The cinematography was awesome, and the sound was definitely a huge factor in my enjoyment of the film.An awesome story, and, despite some crude attempts at humor in the beginning, one that had me as excited as Braveheart.Not looking for any messages here (anti-organized religion?), just enjoying Jaguar Paw's(Rudy Youngblood) big adventure. And, how about his wife (Dalia Hernández)? What a trooper!",Apocalypto
86,davidmvining,Mel Gibson is a crazy person,10,8 December 2020,"Mel Gibson decided to make an action movie in Mayan America, in Mayan. He really is a crazy person, and he's the exact kind of crazy person who should be getting tens of millions of dollars to make movies, because he took one of the weirdest ideas for a relatively large budgeted action movie and made it work pretty much flawlessly. He understands character, escalating tension, theme, and the mechanics of action filmmaking so well that he can seemingly do this in any environment and setting.Jaguar Paw is a young hunter in a small village in Mayan America before the arrival of Europeans. His father, Flint Sky, is a steadying hand that explains the movie's core concept, that fear is a disease. Brought on by the arrival of a terrified group from a foreign tribe passing through their forest for safety, from what they don't say, the advice ends up weaving through the rest of the movie rather elegantly. The opening scenes are mostly about building a sense of character around the archetypal hero and those around him, creating a strong sense of community in this small village. The movie takes its time to show us little moments like the mother-in-law to Blunted, who demands a grandchild, pushing him into his hut with his wife and the effects of a prank that Flint Sky plays on Blunted in his quest for children. There's time with an old storyteller and the easy feeling of calm that rests over the village in normal times.Those times, of course, are not meant to last, and the reigning Mayan king's soldiers, led by Zero Wolf, arrive for captives. The attack on the village is filled with brutality, and it often becomes hard to watch when matched with Gibson's affinity for film gore. Hunters die defending their families. Women are carried off-screen for rapes. Children are left crying helplessly as they watch their entire world burn before them, and it's all just the start. Jaguar Paw manages to get his wife and young son into a hole by the village, but he's captured before he can do anything else. Zero Wolf, along with his soldiers including his son Cut Rock, lead the captives away from their village, tied together, over mountains, across rivers, and through a deforested area until they finally reach the city. The steady build of terror around these sights, matched by a well-executed soundtrack including an ominous score from James Horner, escalates until they reach the collection of pyramids at the city's center. The entire journey is about fear, calling back to Flint Sky's words to his son. Fear builds within everyone as they face physical challenges, brutality, and finally strange new sights with little to no explanation. This is where the choice to set the story in such an unfamiliar world to most viewers really pays off because the new world ends up feeling as strange to the audience as to Jaguar Paw, allowing us to share in the base emotion.The ritual sacrifice at the movie's center is actually quite interesting. Based on looks that the priest and the nearby king share, it's obvious that they know that what they're doing will never appease Kukulkan, their god. Whether they believe in the god at all is up for grabs, but they've obviously timed the sacrifices with the solar eclipse they know is coming, using it to try and placate their screaming people below, providing some way to explain away the crop failures and disease that are undermining the society. The ruling elite have no real answers, so they descend into ceremony and fear for their people, to keep those people in line and themselves in power. And, absolutely none of it is said explicitly. It's done through subtle looks from some characters we've never seen before. This is really the joy of cinematic storytelling. You can get so much from so little.So, Jaguar Paw is fortunate enough to be the one on the pedestal when the moon hides the sun, sparing his life, but the bloodletting was never for Kukulkan. Their lives were never important one way or the other to the ruling class, so what do they do with them when their role in the ruse is done? Dispose of them, of course. Jaguar Paw manages to get away, killing Cut Rock in the process, and the final chase is on. Zero Wolf has every motivation to pursue Jaguar Paw for days back to Jaguar Paw's forest. As Zero Wolf and his group of hunters gives chase, the hunters get picked off one by one by the forest, starting with an attack by actual jaguar. Fear grips them as they get closer to Jaguar Paw's forest where he has the knowledge of the land and the advantage. The action is dynamic and exciting while also clear and easy to understand. The best bit is probably when Jaguar Paw does a large circle from a single spot to get behind the approaching hunters and hit one with some poison darts.Apocalypto is a journey into another world filled with strange sights and sounds. It's so far removed from most people's experiences that it's almost like it's set on a different planet, but that's wholly to the movie's advantage. The film leans strongly into that strangeness while telling a very clear story of there and back again with a central character who has a clear motivation for getting back to help the woman and child he left in a hole with no way out to protect them. The antagonists have motives that are just as clear and understandable. The simple nature of the story is partially key in the telling of a tale in a place so far removed from what the audience knows, and, more importantly, Gibson keeps the intensity and interest up for a whole 140 minutes. Apocalypto is just a great action film and a great time at the movies.",Apocalypto
87,Amyth47,"A superbly thrilling, immersive movie experience.",9,30 December 2018,"My Rating : 9/10'Apocalypto' is probably one of the most underrated movies of the past decade. One of the most incredible action movies ever - it is an absolutely immersive movie experience: the language, the costumes, production design, the introduction scene, the lack of recognisable faces - we feel immediately transported into Pre-Colombian Central America and we believe we are there - which is honestly a rarity for a period piece.The acting is top notch and the lack of recognisable faces makes it that much real and interesting. Once the action begins and it takes a while to do so as there's ample character and world building which is very much required before we as viewers become invested, there is really just a giant chase sequence similar to Mad Max: Fury Road, it doesn't stop and it keeps you at the edge of your seat until the very end, and I don't think there is any film that does action and character arc quite like this.The camera work, the editing, the rhythm and sound design all converge together to make you feel every little detail as if you were there, and I found my heart beating faster until the very end. Mel Gibson delivers and how!",Apocalypto
88,justin-fencsak,great film about a piece of history,8,13 May 2020,It's much better than The passion of the Christ and is more like Braveheart as well as The Patriot and telling about culture and the civilizations. that were in it. Be prepared to read a lot of subtitles as you did with Passion. The violence in this movie are more natural in tone and more realistic than Passion and it's long enough to waste your time enjoying this film which can be seen for free on Amazon Prime and I saw this movie before on bluray from netflix. The way it was shot and mixed are pretty good for a Mel Gibson movie. Not recommended for kids.,Apocalypto
89,Rob_Taylor,An excellent movie.,8,12 September 2007,"After all the recent furore surrounding Mel Gibson, I have to say I was prepared for the worst when I sat down to watch this film. However, I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by how the movie turned out.There is no pandering to the audience. If you want to enjoy this movie, you have to make the effort to.Firstly, you have to enjoy subtitles. There is no English spoken in the film at all. It is all pure Mayan. I'm sure there is a dubbed version, but I can't help but think it would lessen the impact the film makes to watch it.Secondly, it's a little gruesome in places. It could have been much worse had they decided to glory in the gore but, instead, they treated the bloodshed as exactly what it was in those times.....a routine part of Mayan culture. As a result, it never looks out of place or gratuitous. In short, it furthers the story, rather than dominates it.The story isn't so much about one man's struggle to save his family as it is about fathers' obligations to their children. The main character, Jaguar Paw, having been captured by the more advanced Temple-building Mayans, is desperate to escape in order to save his wife and child from drowning in a pit, where he hid them earlier. His own father, slain by his captors, also tried to protect him. Finally there is the leader of raiding party, whose son is along on the trip as some kind of ""rite-of-passage"", terribly proud of his son's rise to manhood. So it is that the story focuses on these father-son relationships as the main theme of the movie - the driving force, if you will.The movie is beautifully shot and the decadence of the more ""civilised"" Mayan culture is well-captured in the cinematography. Having started the movie with the simple forest-dwelling folk, the more familiar (to Western minds, anyway) culture of the sacrifice-oriented Mayans is as shocking and incomprehensible to the viewer as it is to the unfortunate captives witnessing it for the first time.It's hard to pick any major faults with this film. Indeed, as far as I was concerned there are only minor ones. The film may be a trifle long, but in thinking about it, I would find it hard to say where they could cut anything out. Either way, I'm talking only ten or fifteen minutes here, so it's hardly a big issue. Also, the decadent nature of the temple-builders was a tad overdone....but just a little. Again, though that was the way it seemed to me, I couldn't tell you where they could have improved it.All in all, this is one of the best films I've watched this year (which, admittedly, isn't saying a lot) and I just wish more movies were made like this, that don't pander to the studio-perceived audience demographic.Well worth watching.",Apocalypto
90,screenman,Bouncing Heads,8,21 April 2011,"I've grown a little cold towards Mel Gibson. His 'Patriot', 'Braveheart', and 'Galipoli' have a barely-disguised anti-British seam running through them. That said; all of his movies are at least vigorous, there's just a great deal of blood and guts in them. 'Apocalypto' seems to be very much his baby. The name of Gibson features several times amongst the credits. But the man does like to paint a BIG picture. Most of his movies are epic in scale, and it seems a bit unfair to knock 'em just on the grounds of historical inaccuracy. Most movies are entertainment, not academic presentations.With this in mind, 'Apocalypto' delivers a violent, gory and visceral experience. It is not for the gastrically-challenged. But there's plenty more going for it too. Filming is absolutely sumptuous. I didn't think there was that much rain-forest left. Camera-work is exciting, with a nice mix of types, and styles, making full use of furious conflict and forest stillness. The sound track is right on the money. Most of the characters are unknown to me, but I still found myself empathising with their various plights - no mean feat when the entire script was 'native' with subtitles beneath. Of course, there was daft stuff - like the total solar eclipse that went from first incursion to Bailey's Beads in the space of about one minute and the human hearts that were neatly removed from their sacrificial victims in even less time - and still beating!The collapse of the great indigenous civilisations of central and south America are a much-neglected subject in cinema, and though Gibson's effort sometimes has a hint of campiness in the violence and blood-letting department, it's a very brave and involving effort even so. It certainly kept me watching. I felt that the earlier 'The Mission' was a more mature effort, but that may just be down to its A-list stars and Morricone's magnum-opus score.Gibson was its director, and like all others takes huge liberties with history. But viewed without prejudice as an interesting piece of artistic entertainment, it's both a technical tour-de-force with an involving storyline. whether or not the violence is excessive is much a matter of taste.",Apocalypto
91,brando647,Mel Gibson's Best Film Yet,9,10 December 2007,"My only regret in watching this movie for the first time was that I was unfortunate enough to have missed it in theaters. I imagine this must have made for a great movie-going experience on the big screen. I have been a fan of Mel Gibson's work for years and I was blown away by his latest piece of work. The movie is set in an ancient Mayan civilization and the dialogue is all in the Mayan language. It follows Jaguar Paw (played by a fantastic Rudy Youngblood) as his village is raided and taken captive to be used as slaves and human sacrifices. It's a very simple story that provides one man's view of life in a long extinct society.I don't know where to begin about this movie. There's a lot to love about it and very little to hate. I would have to say the most impressive aspect of the movie is the look. This film is absolutely gorgeous: from the beautiful jungles of Mexico to the villages and temples of the Mayans. This is probably one of the most visually stunning movies of 2006. In addition, the costuming is awesome and provides that extra feeling of authenticity. Mel Gibson's film throws you right into that time period and makes you feel as if you're right there, in the middle of the action. The cast consists of unknowns and newcomers, with only a couple experienced actors, and they pulled off this challenge superbly. The highlights of the film's performances come from Rudy Youngblood (a relative newcomer as our protagonist), Gerardo Taracena, and Raoul Trujillo. These men are fantastic at expressing without the need for words, using only their body language.A lot of people have criticized this film for its violent content. While it does have its fair share of blood and violence, I don't feel that it goes over-the-top. The violence may be graphic, but it gives the movie it's primal tone. I would not recommend watching this movie if you are sensitive to violence, though I feel you would be missing out on a great experience.Although, if you're one who hates subtitles (""I don't wanna have to READ my movie""), you might just want to move along...",Apocalypto
92,bob-rutzel-1,Pure Excellence,10,28 July 2007,"Pure Excellence A native tribe is overrun by invading Mayan warriors.I avoided this movie for some time because I was told it was all in sub-titles. But, I was convinced to give it a try and am glad of it. The sub-titles are short and easy to read and you don't miss anything. This is some movie.Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the man knows how to shoot a movie. I am very surprised he didn't get a nomination for Best Director. Very surprised. The camera work in this movie is nothing short of outstanding. The movie did get nominations for Achievement in Makeup and for Sound Mixing. And, yes am also surprised it didn't get nominated for Best Picture.The acting performances rival anything you have ever seen anywhere and I have no idea who the actors are. I recognize Rudy Youngblood as Jaguar Paw because this is basically his story being captured and trying to escape.The movie is a little long and many early scenes could have been cut out or cut down some. For a movie this long, some humor sprinkled in might have lessened the time, but the humorous attempts were too early in the movie and really weren't all that humorous anyway and were just there to show horsing around by the warriors of the tribe before they were invaded. After that it was all business.The chase scenes were truly exciting. Those cameramen really earned their pay for those scenes.Only one thing bothered me somewhat. As Jaguar Paw is being chased by the Mayans, he falls into quicksand. Okay, he gets out and you would think the Mayans would fall into the quicksand too as they are really hot and close on his heels. But, there are no scenes of the Mayans falling into the quicksand. I thought that strange.they were right behind him..they didn't know the lay of the landhmmmm..Anyway, this is an excellent movie and don't let the idea of sub-titles keep you away. Yes, there is some gore and this is not for kids.Although this wasn't nominated for Best Picture, I would have had a hard time picking between Blood Diamond and Apocalypto.

The main guy, Jaguar Paw was sure a good runner! I mean heck, there was a time where he was running for literally about 23 hours or so. I was amazed. There was good cinematography and the main bad guy was so evil that he brought back memories of Magua from Last of the Mohicans. Yes, Mel Gibson directed it. There is really no anti Jewish message in this film. I am now very interested in that culture. Some folks think that this movie is about how the Mayan civilization was wiped out. It is not. It does have some gross head rolling (literally) scenes where they sacrifice dudes from that pyramid thing we see on the History Channel. I suggest seeing this. Great movie. Lots of good violence.",Apocalypto
96,sme_no_densetsu,A pretty good action flick but nothing more,7,21 May 2008,"In the dying days of the Mayan empire a village of men and women are set upon by a horde of warriors seeking fresh sacrifices to slake the thirst of the gods. One of the captives, Jaguar Paw, leaves behind his pregnant wife and child temporarily safe (though essentially trapped) at the bottom of a pit. Undaunted, he plots to escape his captors and return to their aid.The actors in this film are all relatively unknown and likely to stay that way. Rudy Youngblood, as Jaguar Paw, has the most screen time but I do not feel that he has enough presence to carry the film.That being said, the emphasis of the film is unmistakably on adrenaline pumping action. Jaguar Paw's escape and pursuit is basically an extended chase sequence. It moves at such a breathless pace that you can't help but get caught up in the excitement.However, it is when the film tries to go beyond action that it falters. There's sophomoric humour, nonsense about omens and little depth despite the vague ideas about the end of an era. Mel Gibson's direction follows the action admirably and captures some striking imagery now and then but is not especially remarkable.Had the film expanded upon the fate of the Mayan empire it might have attained greatness. As it is, this film is a commendable action flick with little of any deeper significance.",Apocalypto

This film shouldn't have worked, even as you watch it. It seems so chaotic and messy there's no reason why it should work. A film that tells the tale of the beginning of the fall of the Mayan civilization appears interesting but hardly entertaining. Gibson meshes in elements of family, the supernatural, weird humor, Hollywood style action sequences. horror movie grotesquery, real video, history and religious and poltiical symbolism. And it works. How? you may ask. I'm not really sure . I'm still in awe. At it's heart it's the story of a young man trying to get back to his pregnant wife and child before they die. After being captured by fierce Mayan warriors and many of his friends being brutally sacraficed he escapes and they go on the hunt for him. The film is absolutely thrilling and enthralling. The performances from the newcomers are engaging and award worthy. The cinematography is crisp and creative. The direction is near flawless. Despite every controversy surrounding this film. It remains untarnished and stands as a shining example of cinematic masterwork. I laughed, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat and I felt. I took something away from this film.

99,dunmore_ego,An Epic Fable in a Jugular Vein.,8,3 January 2007,"*Mel Gibson's Apocalypto* is a bone axe to the cervical vertebrae at the base of the skull; jungle-wild beauty juxtaposed with bestial brutality, exceptionally well-executed.Emphasis on executed.Though an ominous quote by Will Durant opens the film (""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within""), writer-director Mel Gibson (with co-writer Farhad Safinia) offers no reasons for the fall of the Mayan civilization bleeding for his salacious cameras, instead flying off the axe-handle in another direction entirely, focusing his fable on the gruesome interplay of individual Mayan villagers; his star warrior a Lethal Weapon, his principal antagonists stepping straight from the glistening man-butt highways of Mad Max, and his gleeful bloodletting approaching levels only a hellish Holy Bible could match.*Apocalypto* opens with a jungle hunt (olive-sinewed Mayan warriors bring down a wild tapir in nothing but bare feet, bone axes and breechclouts, mocking us mollycoddled modern pansies with their bronzed machismo), a practical joke (as they tease a fellow warrior), and a forewarning of evil (a disheveled, fleeing tribe comes upon them, bringing fear in their wake). Gibson's writing and directorial finesse has never been more evident, this smooth-paced opening jolting with adrenalin, calming with camaraderie and then alarming with portent.Is the ""evil"" that of the Spaniards bringing their anointed death in the name of Christ, or the coming of Quetzalcoatl, or the Harmonic Convergences of José Arguelles? Will we learn of Mayan creation  the Popol Vuh  to better understand Mayan destruction?...No. About the only philosophizing Gibson does is via tribe patriarch, Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead, resembling Russell Means as Chingachgook from *Last of the Mohicans,* 1992), who counsels his son, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood, the Lethal Weapon) on casting out fear from his being.Come dawn, viciously tattooed and body-pierced Holcane warriors (Mad Max redux) decimate Flint Sky's village, executing him sadistically and heart-wrenchingly in front of Jaguar Paw, and taking Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers captive.The Holcane, led by Zero Wolf (the intimidating Raoul Trujillo, whose sincere ferocity conjures another character from *Mohicans*  Wes Studi's Magua) trek their captives to a Mayan city where the women are sold and the men are painted blue in preparation for sacrifice (what is it with Gibson and blue body-paint?). Atop a great step pyramid, the Mayan royalty have attained such a casual attitude toward excessive human sacrifice (to ostensibly stave off a drought) that the royal youngsters watch and yawn as blood-deranged priests carve out the still-beating hearts of young men, lop off their heads and toss bodies and heads down the steps for mothers at the base to anoint their babies with the blood. (Even the flesh-gargling god of the Old Testament might have interjected, ""Dudes, dial it down to a 7!"") The high priest proclaims, ""We are a people of destiny!"" which slaps us into realizing that the ancient Mayan sacrifices were not too different from our current human sacrifices, when offering up our youngest and sturdiest warriors to unnecessary wars under the high priestage of deranged leaders.Up to this point, the opening quote was still badgering for relevancy - might the Mayan fall be attributed to this sacrificial attrition? - but upon Jaguar Paw's escape from decapitation (through luck of a solar eclipse, and ensuing perfunctory carnage) the movie becomes a simplistic, visceral chase sequence, all primeval agility and dynamite man-muscle. Think *Chato's Land* meets *First Blood.* Jaguar Paw runs to rescue his very pregnant wife and infant son he hid down a well during the Holcane raid; Zero Wolf runs on the diesel of vengeance for his own son, whom Jaguar Paw killed.And as we watch these sinfully fit, jungle-fevered specimens of manhood sprint full tilt day and night through unforgiving foliage with wounds, in bare feet, with no sustenance, carrying heavy battle weapons, we realize how far into the feminine our ""civilization"" has shunted Man. As Pacino says in *Donnie Brasco*, ""These are men are men."" Millennia before corporations and business suits lost Man his powerful physique; before nutritional supplements and Viagra lost Man his vitality; before the shriking of feminists, bull-dykes and women voters lost Man his will to live, this was what Man was. Vital, virile, violent.Gibson's films find their focus - all three epics, all three bloodbaths, all three in foreign languages (*Apocalypto* in Yucatecan Maya, *Passion of the Christ* in Aramaic and *Braveheart* in some kind of Unintelligible Scottish). *Apocalypto*'s cast so casually perform the Mayan tongue and behave so naturally before the cameras that one would never guess that 99-percent of them have only one major motion picture to their credit - this one.After the stunning scenes of virginal jungles, pyramid cityscapes, hand-to-hand combat, the poignancy of village children tearfully following their captive parents until the river blocks them; after humanizing the Holcanes to show the father-son relationship that engines the Zero Wolf-Jaguar Paw vendetta - we are removed from the moment when one of Zero Wolf's warriors is killed by a jaguar puppet.Not only that, this killing is a prophecy. En route to the Mayan city, a young leper girl foretells of the eclipse and of a ""man who runs with the jaguar"" who will topple the Mayan power structure. Prophecy  one way to ruin a movie which would have done perfectly well without it.*Apocalypto* doesn't make good on its premise of apocalypse (a ""lifting of the veil,"" a great disaster, a prophetic revelation), instead providing a thunderous shot of adrenalin to remind us of our warrior past, our masculine legacy, our man-thighed lust.In this age of Oprah and Rosie and the Lifetime Channel and The View, Man could always do with the reminder.(Movie Maniaca, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",Apocalypto
100,chrichtonsworld,Not an epic just an action movie with a simple story,4,12 March 2007,"Braveheart, Mad Max trilogy and the Lethal Weapon series were all Mel Gibson movies I liked. They all had in common that they were unpretentious. Somehow Mel Gibson got very religious and embarked himself upon a crusade. To make movies that contain some kind of message. Passion of Christ is one example of this crusade. After reading several reviews on IMDb, I really had high hopes for Apacalypto. It started out great, but when the aggressors (Mayans) come into the picture it is nothing but torture, blood and be headings. The second hour the movie becomes interesting, because then it shows what this movie is really about. It is all about the action and the adventure. The hunted becomes the hunter. The beautifully filmed action scenes made me forget about the first hour and a half. All what has happened to the main character should be seen as one big prologue to the last half hour. I could talk about the historical inaccuracies, but what is the point. This is not about truth or facts it is about adventure. Although I do need to add that Gibson really got his facts wrong. I think he either got confused or he simply thought it was all the same but at one point he is having The Mayans perform an Aztec ritual. That is just preposterous. I read that Mel Gibson said that he had a message concerning to this movie. So what is the message Mel? That Mayan people were cruel and ignorant or that the jungle is a very dangerous place. Or there is no place like home. Come on there is no message. And don't pretend there is. There is nothing to be learned from this movie because it gives a very limited view on cultural and historical aspects. As a whole experience this movie is very disappointing! It is a long time ago that I have watched this film and had written the review but I can still remember the anguish I felt after having seen it. It's one that angers you so much because some people will actually believe that all of what occurs is based on true historic stories. Especially since he let his actors speak the Yucatec Maya language. Somehow that makes it all seem authentic. But trust me this is not the case. In the end it does not matter that much since basically this is all just context to provide some thrilling action. In that respect this film won't be a total waste of time. However you won't be able to shake the feeling you have been conned. Watch at your own risk.",Apocalypto

102,xredgarnetx,Very good chase movie,10,15 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's APOCALYPTO is a surprisingly hearty adventure yarn, with the gimmick of being spoken in a foreign tongue and using subtitles. A young Indian lad named Jaguar's Paw must grow up in a big hurry when his tribe is captured by another tribe and those who are not killed outright are either sold at auction or sacrificed on a stone altar to a bloodthirsty god. The story borrows heavily from Cornel Wilde's THE NAKED PREY, the greatest chase movie ever made, A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT, for a sequence involving a solar eclipse, and LORD OF THE FLIES, for a mind-blowing finale. The extended hunt that takes up the last third of this very long movie (2.5 hours) is breathtakingly filmed and wonderfully realized as the young Jaguar's Paw turns from the hunted into the hunter. The only thing bogging the movie down is a subplot involving the lad's pregnant wife and young son trapped in a well. Torrential rain, wild beasts and rapacious Indians threaten their existence, but this subplot takes one too many trips to that particular well and we lose interest. Otherwise, what we have is a robust piece of digital film-making, and APOCALYPTO comes highly recommended, even when it clearly damns western civilization in the form of a decadent city built in the middle of the South American jungle. Gibson's distaste for the world in which he lives comes through loud and clear in this particular segment. We forgive him his liberal leanings, as this exciting movie flies by in the blink of an eye and leaves one wishing for more. The actor playing Jaguar's Paw, Rudy Gonzalez (billed here as Rudy Youngblood), is simply amazing in the lead role. The hoops Gibson has Gonzalez jumping through must have cost the kid dearly during the shoot, although some sequences are CGI or otherwise optically created. Don't let the talk about the film's gore level put you off, by the way. It is far less gory than, say, TURISTAS. Gibson knows what to show and what not to show.",Apocalypto
103,Maciste_Brother,Simplistic and amateurish. How was this released to theaters?,1,20 October 2007,"It's amazing that APOCALYPTO was released on the big screen. This is direct to home video stuff. The film has no story to speak of, the acting is amateurish, the direction is sloppy and it's basically a glorified exploitation film that, remarkably, doesn't even deliver on its exploitive elements (is the director a fan of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST?). The main problem of this problematic production is the execution. It's totally unconvincing. The director thinks that having the dialogue spoken in a native tongue will make this ultra kitschy thing look more authentic. It doesn't and it just shows how shallow this production really is. Heck, Peplums of the 1960s look more convincing than this.The acting is directly from the Ahnuld Schwarzenegger school of dramatic acting: look menacingly with your eyes with a sideway glance. Ugh. Glad to know Mayans behaved like meatheads back then. Don't expect to see any of these ""actors"" in any other movies. APOCALYPTO is also borderline racist, showing Mayans as a bunch of savages who crave nothing but killing. In fact, the flimsy story is propelled either by amazing coincidences (eclipse; it rains just at the right dramatic moment; Spaniards appear on the same day, etc) or by the stupid action/decisions made by the few main characters: we watch Mayans warriors running after a young man who escaped death at the sacrificial altar when an eclipse occurred just as he was about to be beheaded (major eye rolling). That's the whole story. The whole chase scene is basically ""Rambo in the Jungle"". Most of the movie was shot on HD video, which gives an added cheap feel to the already amateurish film, certainly during the chase scene. The moment when the jaguar jumps on a warrior and rips his face off is so unconvincing that I thought for a moment there that this was a comedy. The jaguar's head is basically a hand puppet. For a blood-soaked film, you'd think they would have spent a little more money on the gore effects. Where's Tom Savini when you need him?And then there's the ending, which is so pat and unrealistic that I cringed.After watching APOCALYPTO, I wondered: all this effort for what? What a waste of time and energy.",Apocalypto
104,mstomaso,The opinion of a professional archaeologist,8,5 September 2008,"I've been a professional archaeologist for 21 yrs. And despite having only worked on a few projects involving the Maya, I am well aware of the vast cinematic license used in Apocalypto - as well as the many aspects of Mayan life that the film's creators got right. My purpose however, is not to discuss ANY of this. Rather, I want to appreciate the film for exactly what it is - an entertaining and heroic story set in ancient Mesoamerica with the usual Mel Gibson attention to atmospheric use of details. The actors speak Mayan, but this is not The Passion of Kukulcan. The script nicely shows the range of customs and culture that actually thrived in Post-Classic Mayan times, and for once, depicts Native Americans as people with senses of humor! The costuming and sets are amazing and the warfare is honestly and brutally depicted.Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is the son of a chief in a small Mayan lowlands forest village during Post-Classic collapse. These Maya may well be ancestors of the contemporary Lacandon. Refugees have been seen in the forest and foreshadow a coming disaster. That shadow is a merciless battalion of mercenaries working for the patron god of a nearby urban center. They are seeking slaves and sacrificial victims. What can Jaguar Paw do to protect his young child, his pregnant wife, and his beloved village?Unlike some of Gibson's recent films, Apocalypto is a fairly straightforward adventure story with a lot of brutal action. It also hints at subtle but intelligent critique of religious fanaticism, elitism and classism, and displays a great respect (though not exaggerated, worshipful or patronizing) for the living culture it loosely portrays.Acting: ADirecting: ACinematography: A+Sets: ACostumes: A+Story: BScript: BHistorical Accuracy: C- (but who cares?)Worth seeing for adventure fans, and fans of ancient warfare films. But turn to Archaeology Magazine or Latin American Antiquity if you're too concerned with facts to enjoy prehistoric fiction.",Apocalypto
105,blott2319-1,Flawed but still thrilling,8,17 April 2021,"It seems like Mel Gibson has some themes in most of the movie that he directs and one of those things that was quite evident in Apocalypto is his fascination with bloody violence. I can take a lot, but this movie dips its toes into the torture porn category to a degree that I found unpleasant. Perhaps more frustrating is the fact that these extremes of violence felt like an unnecessary addition to a movie that I enjoyed a great deal. The adventure of this innocent Mayan tribe as they are thrust into a dark and dismal future was heartbreaking to watch. I found myself wishing the entire movie was centered on a whole group of these men rather than just one because I wanted them all to escape safely, particularly because they took the time to establish this close bond they all shared.That's not to say that I failed to enjoy the journey of Jaguar Paw. His fight to survive was thrilling and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. I also appreciated how well Apocalypto handled the setup and payoff of certain plot points. Most of the things that come into play in the climax were established early, and that made it all click as a narrative story. However, there was one deus ex machina that arrived at the 11th hour which I found off-putting (even though I saw it coming.) This movie didn't need that extra element to the plot, and I felt it made the ending somewhat less satisfying. It's a shame because without that one note that fell flat at the end, and the excessive gore, Apocalypto was a genuinely great action thriller. I was literally on the edge of my seat in some scenes, and could not look away, which is why I ranked it well even if it was flawed.",Apocalypto
106,sarastro7,"Decent action movie, but nothing more",7,31 January 2007,"Apocalypto? This movie made no statement whatsoever about just why the Maya realm was declining. OK, so there was a drought and they thought it would appease the gods to have some human sacrifice. So? So, that's the premise for a fairly good action movie about a guy heroically leading some bad guys on a merry chase in order to save his family. Something we've seen many times before, only here it was set in the Mayan culture, and perhaps with a bit better acting than we are used to from action movies. But that's all it was: Generic if well-produced action fare, complete with sadistic bad guys. Oh, and some mumbojumbo about a prophecy and a jaguar-human, but that was quickly forgotten and came to nothing. Decent enough movie, but with no big statements and no particular over-arching vision. Your average, well-produced Saturday night popcorn movie. Watch, munch, forget.I rate it a 7 out of 10. 6 for the story and an extra notch for the actors.",Apocalypto
107,ElijahCSkuggs,"Fantastic, Brutal, Emotional Film",10,8 December 2006,"Mel Gibson has done it again. The dude seriously knows how to make a movie. Apocalypto is the best time I've had at the theaters this year. I enjoyed it more than Flags, Borat, Departed, Feast, Texas....all of em. Some more than others obviously. Apocalypto is another awesome piece of work that Gibson has been apart of. EDIT: I know from this paragraph alone, I've had three people disagree with my comment.Apocalypto is about Jaguar Paw and his tribe who are enslaved and forced to be sacrificed by the invading Mayans who believe it's a necessity to sacrifice humans (or warriors I believe they say) so their civilization may again prosper. Horrible and unbelievable events occur to make one of the most exciting and emotionally charged flicks I've seen in a long time.The movie contains almost all unknown actors and they all do a very nice job delivering their parts. I have to give a nod to the leader/father of the invading Mayans, he was great. Apocalypto is a violent, heartwarming, intense, beautiful, brutal and amazing flick that should be checked out by all movie lovers. I could go on and on about it, about how people are saying it's too violent, or it's not historically correct or about Mel Gibson being ""nuts"" these days, but I'm not, I'm writing this to tell you that it's a great film. I would like to mention that it has one of the best chase scenes I've ever seen in a movie.If you like emotionally charged movies like Braveheart, City of God, Amores Perros, Passion of the Christ, Saving Private Ryan, there's a good chance you're going to really enjoy Apocalypto. Keep up the good work Mel. 9.5 outta 10",Apocalypto
108,Andy-296,Great adventure film,8,3 February 2007,"This movie has been heavily criticized by many (at least, where I live) but this is actually a great adventure film. The second half of the movie, as the hero is chased through the jungle by a group of Mayas, is terrific and breathtaking film-making, the best thing that Gibson has ever made. Of course, if cinematic violence is not your cup of tea, you might be better off skipping this film. Now, in terms of history, there are several inaccuracies that are obvious to even those of us not heavily versed on the Mayas. Though recent archaeological findings has made obvious in recent years that the Mayas practiced (as many societies throughout history) human sacrifices, the way they are portrayed here seem more related to the Aztecs. Another obvious mistake is having the Spaniards appear at the end: the Mayas had already left the cities by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century (for what reason, is the major mystery of the Mayas), and were living in rural villages.",Apocalypto
109,marcin_kukuczka,A unique journey into a twilight of mysterious world and into a new beginning,10,1 January 2007,"To start with, I must say one thing which concerns this review. If you expect to find some discussion of Mel Gibson's personal viewpoints here, don't bother yourself and stop to read it. You won't have it since it is not Mel's minor ""excesses"" that I consider of utmost interest but his latest movie. I have always been aware that Gibson is a wonderful filmmaker with unlimited flair for history, action, drama, and profoundity and he has not disappointed me. After his masterpiece of religious epic, THE PASSION, comes his masterpiece of mystery, APOCALYPTO. There are many arguments that strongly support the movie's strong points, yet, I would like to concentrate on three aspects that, in my opinion, make APOCALYPTO a unique unforgettable experience.First, it is the technical point: cinematography. The movie is an absolutely overwhelming picture throughout. When I saw it carefully for the second time in the theater and analyzed shot by shot in detail, I realized that I was watching an icon of screen harmony. The cinematography made me stunned by magnificence and the power of visual masterwork. At most of the scenes, I just stared at the screen being involved in total admiration as if I was seeing high art that magnifies the vision. This, of course, goes in pairs with picturesque locations the film was shot in and the fabulous retrospection of the Maya civilization. The waterfall sequence is just breathtaking. However, the magnificence of the forgotten past reaches its climax at the moment of the entrance into Maya metropolis with markets, temples and crowds of mysterious (for Europeans) people. Consider these wonderful faces! Some of them look so authentic and so amazing that you feel you are there, hundreds of years back. UNFORGETTABLE! Second, it is the cast and their performances: not famous people, no ultra stars but people who act like real professionals. Even the ancient language (here Gibson faces the linguistic experience again) is not that necessary since all is expressed by faces. This way of acting clearly resembles the beginnings of cinema and silents where face was the one and only conveyor of message. I loved Rudy Youngblood in the main role, he is absolutely terrific at expressing every single feeling. Others are also memorable, including Dalia Hernandez as beautiful Seven and the villains: Raoul Trujillo as Zero Wolf and Gerardo Taracena as cruel Middle Eye. And that little girl the hostages meet on their way (Maria Isidra Hoil)...it's extraordinary what she did. Fear spreads everywhere and she does a perfect job as a 7 year-old actress. The fact they are all Mexican people and not famous adds the feeling of authenticity to the entire movie and accurately serves its purpose.Third, it is the reference to modern times and the universal content. We see the contrast between the idyllic nature of the village and the twilight of the Maya Empire which is spoiled by wealth, greed and vanity. The high priest (Fernando Hernandez) tells the people they are the descendants of the sun, the beloved nation and orders them to rejoice. However, what rules in their world is the corruption, brutality and unrestrained desire to gain more and more. Yet, there are goodies who want to live a normal life. Except for the main characters, remember the old guy in the village who tells a profound tale about human-nature relations? Or can you skip the moment when a group of children cry out to a mother taken in hostage ""They are from now on with us! We'll take care of them!""? The moment when the hostages leave the burnt villages and the picture focuses on the poor kids automatically makes eyes tearful. What is there that the goodies experience? suffering... Nevertheless, they don't give in to fight for their freedom and dignity. That is what APOCALYPTO is about: not only a spectacle but also a universal story about human desire to start a new happy life, a new beginning. Yet, this aspect can be analyzed when you watch the film deeply reflecting on its content. The ""apocalypto - a new beginning"" or ""unveiling"" appears to be symbolized at the end by a newborn baby and Jaguar Paw saying that they will start a new life...Some people complain about predictable plot and extreme violence. Yes, the action is predictable; yet, it does keep viewers' attention from the very beginning to the very end. While we have action (particularly chase), we also have interesting insights into jungle's reality. As for violence, it is the only aspect about which I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, the film IS brutal, sometimes too brutal to be seen by delicate viewers. On the other hand, brutality, though realistic, has its reasonable limits. The human sacrifices, for instance, are not that horrifying as I had expected them to be before seeing the film.Summing it up, we would be terribly unjust to judge Mel in terms of one aspect, like violence, not seeing plenty of virtues in his movies. You may think of him as you like, that is your personal opinion. One fact, however, is certain and you have to admit it if you are an objective, constructive critic: he is a terrific filmmaker, the one of very few directors who can really make something people have never experienced before. As an epic fan, I consider APOCALYPTO one of the most original and stunning pictures I have seen.",Apocalypto
110,gftbiloxi,The Passion of the Maya,5,3 February 2008,"As more than one commentator has noted, in terms of plot APOCALYPTO seems to draw from the 1966 THE NAKED PREY, the 1932 THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, and the numerous films both have influenced over the years. In this particular instance the story focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), whose presumably peaceful village is destroyed by Mayans intent upon obtaining human sacrifice to appease their bloodthirsty gods. After a harrowing march to the Mayan city, Jaguar Paw escapes death--and the city, with a furious party of Myan warriors in hot pursuit.Not surprisingly, there is considerable bleed-over from Mel Gibson's 2004 THE PASSION OF THE Christ into the 2006 APOCALYPTO. The two have often been compared in terms of violence, but the connection goes quite a bit deeper this; it is embedded in the subtext of the film itself. A forced march while tied to long poles; a prayer uttered by a woman that sounds suspiciously like a Mayan-language Hail Mary; a prophesy that warns about a man ""reborn from mud and earth"" who will ""end your world;"" and enough arrow and javelin wounds to slay Saint Sebastian himself several times over. The ending is a bit of a quandary, certainly more open to interpretation than that of THE PASSION--but striking the same tone and tying all the subtextual imagery directly to the Roman Catholic Church. And we need hardly mention the title of the film itself, a reference to the vision of St. John the Divine.It is also worth noting that, like THE PASSION, APOCALYPTO has a none too subtle point: the Mayans, at least as Gibson presents them (the film is riddled with historical inaccuracy, but I'll leave that argument to the scholars), are a corrupt society en route to self-destruction: they have stripped the land of its resources and their civilization has become unsustainable. Given Gibson's own well-known religious sentiments, there is a certain irony in that the Mayans are driven into this by blindly-followed religious motives. In any case, we are clearly intended to read the overall film as commentary of sorts on contemporary society's rape of the planet.Although I would give the dubious prize of ""most violent"" to THE PASSION, there is plenty to go around in APOCALYPTO--and, as in THE PASSION, it is not always of a viable nature. I find it hard to believe that Jaguar Paw's tribe hunted with the horrifically lethal trap shown here; the Mayans were not as blood-thirsty as portrayed here (Gibson seems to have confused them with the Aztecs), and lot many of the rituals, weapons, and the game of ""run for your life"" itself, are highly speculative at best. Even so, I cannot actually say that the violence or its graphic nature are implausible within the context of the film.What IS completely implausible is the amount of physical damage Jaguar Paw sustains without being mortally wounded. He is dragged along in bondage, half hung by accident, escapes sacrifice by a fraction of a second, is shot through with an arrow, and all the rest--but like the old Timex Watch slogan, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking, seeming to run without pause for forty-eight hours, vaulting down a waterfall, and even getting clipped a time or two more, most often with scarcely a pause to wince. But Gibson is fair about it: he endows Jaguar Paw's pursuers with the same absurdly improbable endurance and strength.Although it has its flaws--and what film doesn't?--the truly great thing about APOCALYPTO is the technical brilliance and artistic eye that Gibson and his team bring to the project. It's visually dazzling, and Gibson and cinematographer Dean Semler have knack for selecting one knock-out camera set up after another. Everything from cast to costumes is truly amazing, and the film moves with tremendous speed. One thing it isn't is dull.But it is extremely troubling. In addition to THE PASSION, one might also compare it to the notorious 1979 CALIGULA, a film which so mingled sex and violence that both could be considered equally pornographic. Although there's no visual sex at all--it is a subject Gibson tends to shy away from--APOCALYPTO has much the same effect. The violence is essentially pornographic in nature, teasing us, leading us on to increasingly intense climaxes of blood and gore. One has to wonder at the motives here, particularly when the producer-director-writer is so clearly trying to make a ""save the world"" statement; it seems to me that Gibson's visions are less a solution than part of the problem itself--and doesn't mind, as many scholars have noted, twisting historical fact in the process. It would seem that Gibson is determined to have a personal martyrdom by cinematic proxy. It's all very problematic.The DVD quality is very fine and offers a commentary track by Gibson, et al and a making-of featurette. Three stars for technical brilliance.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Apocalypto

113,fwomp,"Love Him Or Hate Him, Gibson Knows Cinema",10,24 May 2007,"Love him or loathe him, Mel Gibson can make some damn good movies. BRAVEHEART was wonderfully brutal, which Gibson produced, directed and starred in. Now fully behind the camera in his latest two feature films, THE PASSION OF THE Christ and now APOCALYPTO, Gibson proves he's got both vision and talent (now if he could only keep his personal life out of the tabloids!) Because of Mel's idiotic comments of late, many have seen fit (perhaps rightfully so) to boycott his films. I know I avoided seeing this one until it came out on DVD, a mini-boycott on my part for Mr. Gibson's poor politics and social skills. But the visuals on the trailers kept beckoning me to check out Apocalypto, and so I finally broke down and rented it.It is noteworthy here to say that Mel, regardless of subject matter, can pull viewers into a story. Although The Passion had its anti-Jewish components, it was sumptuously filmed and very well executed. If we're here to talk about films and not the man behind the film, then it's fair to say that Apocalypto is a rousing success.The sets, the dress, the make-up, the incredible story, and the action, all make this film a glue-yourself-to-the-screen experience. Not once did I pull my eyes from the movie, fearing that I might miss this beautiful shot or that amazing character.The story is about Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the future leader of a small band of people that live on the outskirts of the great Mayan culture. He has an ideal life, a loving wife, a tough son, and another kid ""in the oven."" He and his fellow townsfolk hunt the local forest for food and live in harmony with their environment. Until one day he and his tribe are ripped apart by beastly slave-gatherers. Realizing that he must hide his pregnant wife and son, Jaguar Paw lowers them into a deep pit for safe keeping during the slave runners attack. Caught, bound, and forced to march miles, Jaguar Paw and his tribesmen are brought to a great Mayan temple where they are to be sacrificed. But as Jaguar Paw's turn comes, a solar eclipse occurs and Jaguar and his remaining band are spared a barbarous beheading.But it ain't over yet.Taken to an open stadium, he and his surviving tribesfolk are told to run toward a field of corn as spears, rocks and other projectiles are hurled at them. At the end of the path, too, is a ""finisher"", the son of the head slave trader who kills off any of those who are wounded. Jaguar Paw, desperate to get back to his wife and child, kills the young finisher and escapes into the jungle. But the king of the slave-gatherers wants Jaguar Paw's blood for killing his son. And thus starts an adrenaline pumping chase through the thick jungle, over massive waterfalls, and deep into Jaguar Paw's country. Not only is Jaguar Paw running from the slave men, he's also running toward his beloved wife and kid in a race to save them before they either starve to death, get injured, or are drowned by flash-flood rains.It is amazing that none of the main actors, supporting actors, or extras have any previous film history (at least not any significant history, really), yet they all played their parts perfectly. Much praise MUST (reluctantly or not) go toward Mr. Gibson for his amazing job directing this genre-busting thrill ride. Not only is it a pseudo-historical piece, but it also has heavy elements of romance, drama, comedy, and action/adventure. Rolling all of those concepts into one film is often impossible, but Apocalypto isn't forced nor overly drawn. It completely lures you in, including the Mayan language which is spoken throughout the entire production (with English subtitles).The make-up consisted of nearly 70 artists who had to re-tattoo each of the 700 main and extra characters daily, a monumental task. And costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY) is to be commended for her outstanding head-dresses and eye to detail (I feel she was cheated out of an Academy Award nomination due to this film's affiliation with Mr. Gibson).So if you're thinking about watching this but don't like Mel Gibson's personally, I totally understand. But you might try it anyway. It is one fantastic piece of cinema.",Apocalypto
114,TOMASBBloodhound,Original and exciting.,9,1 July 2007,"Since there are so few films dealing with the pre-colonized Americas, this was a welcome effort from Mel Gibson and his team. Apocalypto is the story of a young hunter taken from his ravaged village by a posse of Mayan bounty hunters to a city to be sacrificed. Pretty much everyone in the village is either slaughtered or taken prisoner except the young hero's pregnant wife and small child. Will he ever get away and see them again??? Finding out is quite a memorable experience.The charismatic Rudy Youngblood makes an impressive debut as Jaguar Paw who is perhaps the most able-bodied hunter in the village. The villagers we are introduced to seem to be doing okay, though others in the area are clearly suffering from disease. This was a time when Mayan civilization was on the way down. Mayan leaders had begun turning to human sacrifice to appease the gods and hopefully restore prosperity and health to all. People like Jaguar Paw and his village in the rain forest are likely considered expendable to the urban Mayans we see during the middle of the film. Gibson paints quite a bleak and chaotic picture of city life in a Mayan Kingdom.Through events you will have to witness for yourself, Jaguar Paw is able to avoid the executioner's knife. Trouble is, the band of bounty hunters who captured him have other deadly games in mind. The third act of the film details their pursuit of Jaguar Paw through the rain forest where he is clearly a more deadly adversary. The film contains numerous acts of violence and a plethora of painful injuries suffered by most of the cast. Anyone who has seen Braveheart, We Were Soldiers, or Passion of the Christ should already realize that graphic violence is a part of pretty much every film Gibson either directs or stars in now days.Since Gibson was making a film about a little-known people and using their native language, many people expected this film to tank at the box office. Gibson also had much publicized personal difficulties last summer while this film was in post-production. Perhaps that drunken outburst he had with the police was good for generating a little interest. Some people probably went to see the film hoping to hate it, but most certainly walked out thinking that they'd seen something special. This film did in fact recover it's cost and then some at the box office.Apocalypto was shot with digital cameras, and it looks terrific. Not only the shots of the rain forest, but those in the city look beautiful as well. You have to see some of these costumes to believe them. Production was delayed for months due to significant rainfall in southern Mexico, and Gibson actually donated a good chunk of change to several local communities that were affected. Gibson also used direct descendants of these forest-dwelling people as supporting actors. Some live in actual subsistence communities like that of Jaguar Paw to this day.The film is beautiful, exciting, and even educational to some degree. But in the end, it's still just a movie. Not overtly pretentious or preachy. Just a violent exploration of life before Europeans arrived on the scene. Give it a look. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Apocalypto

Don't let the reports of on screen gore or boycotts of Gibson's work keep you away. You'd only be cheating yourself.I love movies, so I see a lot of movies, so ... I sometimes become very bored with movies.Watching this movie was like diving into cool ocean waves. It was bracing and invigorating. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. I didn't just care about the characters, I loved the characters. I laughed and I cried - really.I felt like I was in a completely different world. Gibson's use of Native American actors, speaking a Native American language, was brilliant. I was immersed in something I'd read about -- Mayan civilization -- but had never imagined this fully.I realized, as I was watching this movie, that the controversy around Gibson's drunken, anti-Semitic tirade, has obscured the fact that this may be the first movie that makes use of all Native American actors, speaking a Native American language, that may reach a mass audience. (2001's ""Atanarjuat,"" ""The Fast Runner,"" was not geared toward mass audiences, and relatively few people saw it.) The Native American actors here are stunning.Rudy Youngblood, as Jaguar Paw, the lead character, is a STAR. A star. He commands the screen. I loved him. I wanted what he wanted; I thought what he thought. I was completely involved with his character.Morris Birdyellowhead, as Jaguar Paw's father, is on screen very briefly, but he conveys nobility and wisdom, as well as a mischievous sense of humor.A guy who can't get his wife pregnant...his mother-in-law...a sadistic slave driver...a raiding party's leader...upper class women and a fat kid who gather on a religious altar...every actor is stunning. I believed them all, felt their humanity.It's especially fabulous how Gibson does all this without much dialogue at all. I wonder if Gibson has studied silent film. ""Apocalypto,"" like ""Passion of the Christ,"" relies heavily on many of the same devices used in silent film. Character is communicated via facial expressions and actions rather than lengthy speeches. This further immerses the viewer in the film.Is the film violent? Is the Pope Catholic? I despise violence in pop culture. I don't watch ""The Sopranos"" or any number of any other violent ""entertainments."" Though I wanted to give it a chance, I was prepared to walk out of this movie, if I had to.""Apocalypto""'s violence did not cause me to walk out of the theater. Why? It was, for want of a better word, ""biological."" Gibson's camera records what human sacrifice, something we've all read about, and perhaps seen, depicted in Mayan murals and bas reliefs, actually looked like.""Apocalypto""'s violence reminded me of living in a Third World village, where meat for sale is displayed on walkways. You see the animal's head, eyes, tongue, organs, all splayed out. The violence in ""Apocalypto"" was not like the violence in ""The Sopranos."" We are not asked to admire and identify with those committing violent acts. We have invested in the characters being sacrificed, and we are invited to realize what a true horror human sacrifice was -- not to romanticize it, as people who claim to be modern-day ""Druids"" or ""Pagans"" do. Hey, you want to be a Pagan? Well, here's what it looked like, buddy.Yes, Gibson made anti-Semitic comments while drunk. Yes, people must protest anti-Semitism. So, do that. Protest anti-Semitism. But don't cheat yourself of this movie. If we never saw films by flawed people, we'd never see Roman-rapist-Polanski's ""The Pianist,"" or Alfred-sex pervert-and-misogynist-Hitchcock's work.",Apocalypto

The movie is intense, dramatic at parts, but it shows us that freedom is one of the most important things of ours lives, and we must fight for it until our last breath (we had already seen it in Braveheart"").The plot is based essentially in two main issues: the fight for freedom of ""Jaguar Paw"" (the main character) representing his people that were destroyed/made slaves for rituals by the Mayan empire, and prophecy of declination of that empire. In the movie we don't see the empire's destruction, but we see its cause: the arrival of the Spaniards! (The synopsis refers the Mayan civilization, but I don't remember any reference to it in the movie and, besides, if we talk about historic accuracy, the Mayan empire had already disappeared before the Spanish arrival, so I suppose the civilization portrayed in this movie is the Aztec and not the Mayan)It's a very good movie, with great performances, great production and a great soundtrack (which has fantastic sounds of the jungle and a few tracks with a great tribal ambiance).",Apocalypto
118,EijnarAmadeus,"Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee-",9,2 April 2009,"Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto' is a wild thing that shows Gibson at his very best as a filmmaker. Eleven years earlier he grabbed Oscars for his Scottish highland-tale 'Braveheart', nine years after he shackled film studios and was accused for antisemitism by adapting the last hours of Jesus in 'The Passion of the Christ'. Clearly, Gibson had returned to directing with a new heart. His latest to date, 2006's 'Apocalypto', tells the descending story of the Mayan kingdom facing decline, and we go along for something that's entirely Gibson working on instinct and facing great challenges to rise above them. This is his adaptation of the Maya civilization, and for 140 minutes it's a primal fear sort of thing - shot in crystal-clear HQ we run through the jungle and face up with the rawness of human nature. This is a mean son-of-a-gun, the bone-breaking and blood gushing comes thick and heavy, and with a crew of unknown actors Gibson cooks up a boiling tension and creates a whirlwind of thrills. Historical accuracy aside, 'Apocalypto' goes off into high speed and keeps it up for the entire run.",Apocalypto

It's supposed to be an adventure, action and drama, but that's not how I experienced it.The movie should portray the Mayan people and their culture. The Mayan were a 'civilized' nation, having created great building feats and amenities long before the roman empire was able to do the same.Well, this movie has nothing to do with this. What you get is endless savagery, with primitive people running around in the bush doing ferocious killings of other people. Mel Gibson should know better and the purpose of this movie is beyond me.

122,oneloveall,A bloody epic that falls short of brilliance but remains an awesome action film,7,11 May 2007,"Offering little of it's suggestive title to the forefront, Apocalypto instead serves up one of last year's most fearsome action extravaganzas, filtered of course through Mel Gibson's keen though insatiably violent hand. As detractors lined up to bash the hot-head's latest directorial outing, even his most repugnant of anti-semitic statements, shown lashing out at a business that has helped him thrive, could not derail another assured release from an assured filmmaker. The director of The Passion of The Chirst and Braveheart has certainly found his niche messing around with historical fiction. Taking many cues from what has made his previous films so successful, Gibson shines when it comes to mixing all elements a historical action-drama would require into becoming the most respectful, compelling, appealing, and marketable whole possible.It may be tough to translate a foreign language, brutally savage period piece into a viable marketing phenomenon, but as box office history has shown, Gibson is Hollywood's cash funnel For history. Exhibiting equal part fascination with Mayan history and Mayan bloodshed, no man is more credible at making gratuitous violence somehow seem credible. The exquisite production has obviously been well researched, and a level of authenticity will somehow justify all the excessive and graphic violence when portraying the brutal culture of the Mayan regime near it's fall. While it seems apparent that Gibson, as usual, will exploit his subjects to incite the largest amount of physical discomfort through some masochistic sequencing, but Apocalypto more then ever warrants much of the on-screen bloodshed to be witnessed. How Gibson has decided to portray this culture will remain debatable; some have accused him of stereotyping the ancient culture as a group of frothing savages, but one thing remains certain: the intense and realistic violence used to drive the film along will certainly complement every aspect of the story Gibson has crafted out of his research.At concluding, this mesmerizing ode and warning to a lost civilization is short of any far-reaching implications a subtext may hint at. Nevertheless, Apocalypto remains a startling action adventure throughout it's near 2 1/2 hour run time. With Gibson's continued commitment to fund these historical projects, and bring them to life in a way that compliments everything we have factually accounted for, a heavy focus on the carnage which consumed much of this empire makes a perfect framing for another entertaining historical odyssey.",Apocalypto
123,jdkraus,"Mel delivers again, or does he?",7,16 December 2006,"I have to admit that I'm a Mel Gibson fan and i love his movies. His best by far was Braveheart and the Passion of the Christ (both among my favorites), and he's behind the camera. hearing this coming out, I just had to see it for my own eyes on the big screen.The film is a simple story about a man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) who lives in a village with a perfect life. The first twenty minutes are filled with developing characters and earthy humor. But when bloodthirsty Mayan warrior raid the place, hell breaks loose. Jaguar is taken captive along with others and is sent to be sacrificed for the sake of the Mayan Gods, in which the people believe they have caused a famine, diseasing them. But before he was held captive, he hid his pregnant wife and son in a cave.This is the first hour of the film, and it is simply magnificent. Mel Gibson captures some amazing footage of the jungles and lands they travel and the culture in which has been nearly forgotten, which all pulls me into the film, making it feel realistic like Braveheart did. But then something happened in the film that pulled me away from the film.This vision, culture, and beauty is disrupted into a sudden action flick when Jaguar Paw escapes. Fro there on, the next hour of the film is nothing more than a chase of Jaguar Paw running in a situation of man vs. man, and man vs. nature, in order to save himself and his family. That just dragged on and on, seemingly without an end. So the film goes from art value to an action flick? That's the major flaw that turns a great epic film like this into another Patriot film. i was disappointed.Now, I'm not trying to ruin anyone's viewpoint for those who haven't seen it, but give it a shot, it is a decent film that has some value to it. Despite the fact that Mel threw in some old clichés and a few corny elements. But I have to note like so many others who saw this film, it is loaded with brutal violence throughout. It's not as bad as The Passion, but was a tad worse than Braveheart in a few scenes.For instance, there's a sacrifice scene on one of worshiping temples that involves men getting their hearts cut out, which is very similar to Spielberg's The Temple of Doom, and then their heads are chopped off, and thrown down a flight stairs, bobbling down like bouncing balls. There's other scenes like this that made me cringe, but it's not over the top gore like in most horror films nowadays. I'm not denying the violence, but it's over exaggerated by most critic reviews, simply ignore them.The violence is depicted realistically, unlike Kill Bill or Sin City which is stylized. The violence is not only graphic, but it is emotionally moving, and very Shakespearean styled, meaning a lot of tragedy. Mel, once again is not afraid to bloody messes, and slow deaths.As I said, it contains value. There's great cinematography, which captures the whole mood of the film, as well as blended colors, making everything bright with color. There's also the score by James Horner that is heart-pounding. The make-up job was superb and realistic (should win the Oscar for), the costumes and set-decoration are grand, and the use of sound mixing was highly creative, pulling you into the atmosphere of the film, particularly with characters' breathing as they fight for their survival. The film may be subtitled, but there's not a lot of dialog, the film is mainly expressed through images, like Mel's Passion of the Christ, and they're easy to keep up with.It is a decent film and might receive some recognition in the Oscars. It's not the best thing I've seen, nor is it a disaster, and don't expect much history in it either, for the story is not about the invasion of the Spanish.My rating *** out of ****",Apocalypto
124,FloatingOpera7,The Decline Of A Society: Mel Gibson's Take On Mayan Ruin,5,31 December 2006,"Apocalypto (2006): Rudy Youngblood, Morris Birdyellowhead, Jonathan Brewer, Dalia Hernandez, Carlos Emilio Baez, Israel Contreras, Israel Rios, Ramirez Amilcar, Maria Isabel Diaz, Espiridion Acosta Cache, Mayra Serbulo, Iazua Lario, Hiram Soto, Raul Trujillo, Gerardo Taracena, Ariel Galvan, Richard Can, Bernardo Ruiz, Carlos Ramos, Fernando Hernandez, Maria Isidra Hoil, Abel Woolrich, Antonio Monroy, Rafael Velez, Diana Botello.....Director Mel Gibson, Screenplay Farhad Safinia.Mel Gibson's ""Passion Of The Christ"" (2004) was his debut film as director and with the less controversial/less talked about ""Apocalypto"", currently playing in theaters, he has once again directed a film that, although takes on a different subject matter, is marked with Mel Gibson's signature of excessive violence, blood, torture and physical pain, usually endured by a strong male hero who metaphorically dies and is reborn, who journeys from tragedy to triumph. Surely, there are better ways of expressing this very Hemingway theme but Mel Gibson has made a film that is not historical nor does it offer a fascinating new theory about Mayan civilization and their decline/disappearance. Therefore, I can only give this film a generous but low 5 rating. Clearly, Mel Gibson makes films for money only. This film does not satisfy the curiosity of history lovers who are interested in this period in history, the time of Spanish conquest in Maya/Aztec Mexico/Central America. Other films about this period have proved more accurate to history. The story of Apocalypto is entertaining and targets a demographic of young audiences who in the past have enjoyed Braveheart, The Patriot and other Mel Gibson films which, although dressed up as historical films, are nevertheless works of the mainstream action genre. Heres' the story: Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a family man and native of a poor and small community nestled in the jungle of Mexico/Guatemala. He lives there with his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and their small son. The peaceful village is soon disrupted by a barbaric attack from outsiders. They slaughter some of the villagers and the survivors, Jaguar Paw included, are taken as captives to the main city (presumably the great city of Pelenque or Tenochitlan). Jaguar's pregnant wife and child are left alone deep under a hole in the ground, facing bad weather and animal predators. Jaguar sees the horrors of this supposedly civilized place. To appease the populace who are in despair over the plague of illness, famine and drought in the land, the priests and king offer human sacrifices (the captives)to their gods on the high-rise temples. Some of this is true to history as it's a well-known fact the Aztecs and Mayans conducted human sacrifices but it appears that Mel Gibson has twisted several truths as well. The kings, queens and even their royal children were obligated to give up their own blood, even if not in total sacrifice and some evidence suggests that not every captive was treated as viciously as portrayed in the film. Rather than focusing on the irony of a civilization that was advanced for its time and yet superstitious and violent, Gibson merely uses this mysterious, thought-provoking time as the basis for a drama about a young man proving his manhood and saving his family. The ending offers no real resolution and the arrival of the Spanish is simply a hint at a new beginning. The Mayans were not totally destroyed by the Spanish as many lived to carry on some of the religious ideas and rituals that Mayas still hold sacred today. So, if you want to see a Mel Gibson film about male pride won through overcoming bloody trials, this one's for you.",Apocalypto
125,anselmdaniel,The exciting chases,8,9 February 2019,"This review contains spoilers.Apocalypto is an adventure movie that is directed by Mel Gibson. The movie is written by Mel Gibson and Farhad Satinia. The movie stars Rudy Youngblood as Jaguar Paw, a young hunter. The movie is about the end of the Majan civilization as a young man must escape from raiders.Apocalypto is an exciting adventure movie. The movie is incredibly fast-paced in its execution and story. There is a lot of gore and shock in this movie. The movie does depict human sacrifices as a component of Mayan civilization. At the movie's heart is its focus on Jaguar Paw and his family. The movie carries these characters throughout its 138 minute running time. These scenes form the entire makeup of the movie.The actual movie is a long chase. From the beginning until the end, Jaguar Paw is either running or chasing something. Mel Gibson does do a good job with presenting the action in an exciting way. Most of the scenes have the same structure, but they are filmed in a way that makes the entire movie feel fresh. The visuals in this movie are gorgeous. All of the visual flare contribute to the movie feeling new in 2006 with so fews historical movies. There are no severe problems in the movie visually.The problems that the movie does have lie in the narrative. The plot of this movie is incredibly basic. The movie is one massive chase scene. There is not much development of character that happens in the 138 minute running time. Normally, this is a problem in the movie. This is not a problem here as the rest of the movie is so well-done that I not see plot being a problem.I would recommend 'Apocalypto'. The movie has a solid adventure that is exciting to follow. The movie is impressively shot and staged.Grade: B",Apocalypto
126,moviesleuth2,Complete savagery,5,15 January 2008,"If you can imagine what ""The Passion of the Christ"" would be like as an action film, and instead of Jesus and his followers you would have the Mayans, that's basically what ""Apocolypto"" is like. Except that whereas the former film is powerful and moving, the latter is simply an assault on the viewer.""Apocolypto"" is simply an excuse for Mel Gibson to show viewers how disturbing of a movie he can make. In that respect, he succeeds. But I found myself asking, ""What is the point?"" There's really no plot to speak of, except that a guy named Jaguar Paw is taken as a human sacrifice after his village was attacked and destroyed. At the last minute it is decided that he doesn't need to be sacrificed, and he and the others who were taken are forced to attempt to run away. Both of these situations have casualties before our lone hero, probably because Gibson wants to heighten the suspense. But there isn't any suspense because we want Jaguar Paw to escape only because as humans we don't like to see people mercilessly killed (especially if they're the hero) without reason, not because we are given a reason to care about him.Again. there is really no point to this movie. No plot, the characters aren't developed, and what storyline trajectory there is uses the deaths of his pursuers as the major plot points (most of them receive their own gruesome death).Oh, wait, there is another plot point that I almost forgot. Jaguar Paw has a pregnant wife and young son that he has hidden in a well when the village was attacked and he wants to get back to them so they can live happily ever after (we hope...) but they also suffer from so little development that they suffer the same fate as the other characters.As if it weren't bad enough, the film quality is pretty poor. The film is grainy and feels unprofessional. There was a lot of advertising of the grand scope of the city, but the scenes in the city take up about ten minutes of the screen time. To be fair, some of those visuals are pretty impressive, if completely false (To my knowledge, no city exists that ever looked like that). These are small enough to be nitpicking, but the film itself doesn't live up to any other standards. It's just 2+ hours of senseless violence. In fact, there's so much violence, all of which is mercilessly brutal, that it's only because of the MPAA's corrupt nature that it was not awarded an NC-17. Even still, I was shocked and horrified that nothing had to be cut to avoid the rating.I've heard people talk that the ending ruined the movie because it has a pro-Christian slant to it. While that may be the case (given Gibson's much publicized beliefs), the ending isn't ruinous (at least in and of itself, though one may be able to assume that this was Gibson's intent). However, I find it more likely that the movie itself represents the ""savagery"" of religions other than Christianity and how Christianity ""saved"" everyone from a lifestyle of torture and brutality. I don't necessarily believe this, but it seems a more plausible accusation.My rating: Rated NC-17 for Pervasive Strong Brutal Violence and Gore.",Apocalypto
127,dinky-4,Flawed but fabulous,8,30 November 2006,"The first 95 minutes or so -- up to the eclipse -- is possibly the best movie to date in 2006. It's a voyage of discovery through a virgin world of alien but understandable sensations and it culminates in an arrival at a city of pyramids which constitutes one of the recent cinema's great set pieces. Bizarre, spectacular, hypnotic, fully realized -- like landing on an alien planet of savage, fascinating beauty. After the eclipse, however, the movie settles into a conventional ""chase"" mode which, though interesting, can't compare to the first 95 minutes. The ending disappoints in that it introduces an outside element to this previously enclosed world, and the ending can't resolve the movie's basic dilemma: how can it be both the story of a civilization's decline and also the story of a man's personal triumph.The subtitles actually help in that lines which might have sounded silly or stilted when spoken in English somehow ""work"" when condensed to printed form. (Though one subtitle stumbles with a piece of discordant slang.) These subtitles also help create a distance between the modern audience and the lost world of the past being shown on the screen. And words, either spoken or subtitled, often aren't needed here because the cast has great faces and can use these faces to convey both information and emotion.Though not a fan of ""The Passion of the Christ"" and though feeling that ""Braveheart"" was overrated, it's thumbs up for Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto.""(If only we could get rid of that ungrammatical ad-line: ""No one can outrun their destiny."")",Apocalypto

The blood drip is spotted as a stain three minutes later than the cliché, the villains follow the hero over the thundering watercliche, and for the pumping heart...Gibson, ever the auteur, unveils what it would be like for us lucky filmgoers, after our hearts are torn out *and* our heads cut off.

Gibson did refer to one of his actors as ""Frank"" because he looks just like Frank Sinatra, and the lead is called a good kid. It must have pained Gibson to avoid casting himself as the lead, and he went against the grain not to cast some blond white kid who had shipwrecked and been raised by the Mayans. Gutsy move...however just in case all of the foreign dialect confounds a prisoner of this film, look for the native with the least amount of scarification and face-paint, that's your hero.What's the greater tragedy, the loss of an entire civilization, or this cinematic re-making of it as a action-adventure theme park?",Apocalypto
129,rajdoctor,Apocalypto,6,14 January 2007,"Apocalypto Mel Gibson has carved his niche in making gut wrenching movies  starting with Brave-heart, followed by Passion of Christ and lastly the trilogy Apocalypto. He will surely go down the cinema history as a director who made good movie with excess amount of violence embedded in the script.Apocalypto is a movie with a simple story line. A peaceful tribe in Mandarin is attacked by another tribe and most of the men are captured and taken for sacrificial ceremony. Our hero hides his pregnant wife in a well with his son, and he manages to run away and get back to his family. In the end the advent of Europeans is shown coming to Mandarin land; a man carrying cross signifies shows signs of conversion and peace.In the process of this thin story line, we experience violence that may be depicting the age  a good excuse for the director to justify his first love. The violence heightens to unbearable pitch during the sacrificial ceremony  when the hearts of captured salves are taken out and head cut from the body.There is no reason to show so much violence  except due to director's wishes. The same story line could have been narrated in a different way. But movie making is taking audiences to areas they have never seen and experienced before.Apart from that fact  the movie is a well made movie, with brilliant make-up, costume, acting, direction, photography, and graphic display of action sequences.If you like Mel Gibson type of movie you will love it. And if you are expecting anything else in this movie, you will be wrong. It is violence, violence and more violence. That is Mel Gibson style for us.I am interested to see what he makes next  because he has reached an epitome of depicting violence on screen, and can he get away with his style and first love for his next movie? Or is he still like a caged prisoner who does not know how to break the bars and move to be world class? Let's keep our fingers crossed and wait.(6.5 stars)",Apocalypto
130,WriterDave,Mel's Black and White World: IN COLOR!,8,9 December 2006,"Mel Gibson was most definitely ""off the wagon"" during the making of his insanely entertaining Mayan epic ""Apocalypto."" Sometimes you need a slightly crazy director to make a truly engaging action film.Mel Gibson lives in a black and white world where the lines between good and evil are as clear as night and day. Glossing over the finer points and historical accuracies that a more conscientious director may have reveled in, Gibson presents a simple story of one brave hunter from a small village trying to survive in a big bad world of decadent, superstitious, and villainous urban dwellers who have ravaged his home and carted him off for human sacrifice. His young pregnant wife and son are left behind in hiding and waiting his return lest they starve to death. Our hero is clearly the most athletic and handsome man in his village, his wife the most beautiful and attractive woman, and his son the cutest kid. It makes them immediately endearing to the audience. It's simplistic and manipulative, but as it was in ""Braveheart"" routing for the pretty people is easy to do and we the audience love to do it. Gibson also does a nice job of setting up the characters showing his usual juvenile macho sense of humor in some male bonding scenes that involve the graphic killing of a tapir. The acting, all amateurs, is surprisingly good and a big plus for the film.Of course, what people come to see is the barbarism and violence that has become the signature of a Gibson production. The film bleeds from head to toe with a tense, white-knuckle, visceral, gritty feel and gore that would make our modern grind-house directors green with envy. Gibson taps again into his obsession with the basest of human vices and the most primordial acts of an unforgiving natural world and dwells on it here in a way that can almost be described as beautiful. In addition to the prerequisite human sacrifice scenes (full of de-heartings and be-headings), there's an absolutely fantastic jaguar attack to the face, a skull cracking and skin ripping battle to the death, a hornet attack, a human birth underwater, and the best snake bite staging I've seen in years. Combine that with fantastically paced foot chase scenes and a gritty earthy feel to the set designs, costumes, and makeup and you get a top notch period piece action adventure film.Gibson only vaguely alludes to the greatness of the actual Mayan civilization. He does show rather accurately the building of their mythic temples and sprawling and complex urban buildings, though he focuses on the fact it was slave labor that was used. When we get a brief glimpse of the Catholic Spaniards landing ashore near the end of this gut-wrenching experience, it almost comes as a relief to know that this culture is about to come to a tragic end. Sure, it spawned a heroic man with a pretty family for us to route for, but for the most part Gibson shows the majority of Mayans as insane as he his. It's a crazy mixed up world Gibson lives in, but when he taps into that primitive desire to see things in black and white with no moral ambiguity, it's quite a colorful event to watch in awe, even if the brightest color he shows us is blood red.",Apocalypto
131,LoneWolfAndCub,"Amazing; an incredible, exhilarating adventure",9,18 January 2007,"Apocalypto is an awesome and highly exciting movie that manages to blend two different types of movie into one.The first 90 or so minutes are pure brilliance. It is the historical part of the movie as we journey through the Mayan way of life and it is beautifully done. We start off by being introduced to one tribe who are civilised and live in harmony with each other. That is until their village is attacked by a much more barbaric tribe, their woman raped and everyone left taken away to be sacrificed. It is quite a sad scene and quite hard to watch, although not all of it is shown on-screen.When one of the captured, Jaguar Paw, escapes the movie immediately changes into an action-adventure chase movie and although it's not as good as the first part it is still an exciting part.To the violence, what a controversial part of the movie. Knowing it was Mel Gibson directing I knew there would be graphic violence and after hearing stuff like ""graphically depraved"" and ""absolutely disgusting"" I was prepared for the worst. Surprisingly it really wasn't that bad. Sure, it was violent but there wasn't a lot of it and it wasn't depraved, it added to the feel of the movie. People tend to overreact to stuff like that.The music was beautiful and the movie looked perfect, it was stunning to watch.

132,Antagonisten,Better than i expected,7,4 August 2007,"I didn't know what to expect when i popped this movie into the DVD-player. Mel Gibson seems to have become somewhat mentally unstable after his Jesus-movie, so i wasn't sure he could direct something coherent.Thankfully enough this movie is not filled to the brim with religious references and arguments. Rather it's a pretty straight-forward adventure/action movie. It's very gory at times, almost excessively so, but it's got a pace that many other recent action movies should envy. One of my usual complaints about action movies these days are the fact that many of them lack a pulse-raiser. The best example of movies that have this is James Camerons action-epics. When watching ""Aliens"" or ""Terminator 2"" i'm always on the edge of my seat. It's almost difficult to sit down because your pulse and body tell you that you need to run. Mel Gibson has actually created something of the same effect here. The main character Jaguar Paw is running and fighting with barely enough pause for us to come up for air.Gibson has indeed crafted a hard-hitting action movie. The story itself, and the characters, are not really very interesting in their own right. But the benefit of keeping the pace high is that the viewer doesn't have time to reflect on that. So in this mix of fights, human sacrifices and solar eclipses, i allow most of it to pass through even though the plausibility-level is dangerously low many times.I guess you could call me pleasantly surprised after watching this. After the trite and uninteresting ""The Passion"", it's good to see that Mel Gibson can create a true no-brainer in a way that's not very common today. It shows, if nothing else, that Gibson is still a competent film-maker. This movie keeps your pulse up far enough to forget about stories and the plausibility of events or historical accuracy. This is one of the better action movies this year.",Apocalypto

Make-up, Hair, Costumes, Sets, Special Effects and Camera Work are all the things that keep this film from being unwatchable.It's lack of story and no plot drag it down so badly.

Jokes are made, life is good, even though the first small droplet of fear has made its way into the bloodstream of the proud warriors.Telling more of what happens doesn't do the film any good - it is a rolling adventure telling the story of a dying race and that information should be enough. Spoken in the language of the Mayans it is (for most) impossible to follow without a subtitle, but the added effect is great - it wouldn't be half as strong when everyone would speak for instance English. It is a very graphical film, in the sense of the camera doesn't pan away for the most gruesome action. It is also highly realistic, it is impossible not to feel the fear the characters are going through.I found it most convincing, apart from a few short scenes, and can just imagine the film was made in the way life was back then and there. It is also a film that is made for the big screen - I don't think it will do very well on a normal TV screen, it just doesn't feel as strong then. But only time can tell for sure.8 out of 10 civilizations coming to an end",Apocalypto
135,phenomynouss,Please win the Oscar... this was a masterpiece,10,10 December 2006,"What a show this movie was.... it thrusts us into the spirit of the Ancient Maya, and restrains nothing in its telling of the tale, which is quite simple in itself.A young man, Jaguar Paw, with a pregnant wife and a young son, goes hunting Tapir for food in the forest, when they come across a horde of people passing through. They tell him their village was ravaged, and while the others listen and simply move on to the village resuming their lives, the encounter with these people haunts Jaguar Paw.Rightfully so, as a mere day later, the same people come and ravage his village. They attack the men, kill those who resist, and enslave all save the children, who they simply leave behind to follow their parents in tears until they cannot follow any longer.Along the way, a diseased young girl tells of a prophecy, in which a man of the Jaguar will bring about the doom of those slavers who listen to her, and all sorts of other omens such as ""He who runs with the Jaguar"".Enslaved, they are taken to a great city made of stone, where one by one the women are sold into slavery, and the men are taken to the top of a great temple to be sacrificed to the Gods, as these people fear that their Gods are displeased, and their end approaches.Just as Jaguar Paw is to be sacrificed, a solar eclipse takes place which the High Priest interprets as the Gods' satisfaction, and lets Jaguar Paw live.The slavers then take the remaining captives to an empty arena-like field, and release the captives two at a time, telling them to try to run away into the forests, while they shoot at them from behind with slings, arrows, and javelin, and with the son of the Chief acting as ""Finisher"" to kill the men as they attempt to crawl away, dying from their wounds.Jaguar Paw is shot through the side by an arrow, and just as he is to be killed, his friend (who had been shot down earlier) attacks the Chief's son, and Jaguar Paw is able to break off the arrowhead and kill him with it, before running off into the jungle. The chief and his men chase him.They chase Jaguar Paw all throughout the jungles, and as they do, all of the diseased girl's prophecies come true. Jaguar Paw is being chased by a Jaguar whose cub he accidentally encountered and disrupted, and as one of the men catches up to Jaguar Paw, he is attacked and killed by the cat.Jaguar Paw is running back to his village, as he has left his wife and child inside a deep stony cave in the ground to save them as the villagers are enslaved.One by one, he devises traps and weapons to kill his enemies, before he can rescue his wife. It begins to rain, and the hole is filling with water.Jaguar Paw kills all but two of the men, but is saved when he flees to the beach, and the two pursuers are frozen in their places, astonished at the sight of men in gigantic ships approaching the beach.Jaguar Paw is able to flee and rescue his wife and child, where they retreat into the forest to find a new beginning...The plight of Jaguar Paw was very deeply human, and the acting was richly superb with light, but not sparse dialogue, and a gamut of emotions being run through all the characters, whose facial expressions and cries of anguish, pain, joy, or pleasure tell more than any amount of dialogue ever could. Along with the beautifully realistic jungle setting and cinematography, this is simply put, a masterpiece. My only fear is that this movie might not win Best Oscar, losing instead to that pretentious ""art"" film Babel, the way Brokeback Mountain and/or Walk the Line and others lost to Crash.",Apocalypto
136,MichaelMargetis,Mel Gibson's Finest Achievement,10,18 November 2007,"Jaguar Paw: I am Jaguar Paw! This is my forest! My sons and their sons will hunt here after I am gone! Say what you want about Mel Gibson -- he's an anti-semite, a misogynist, a racist, a cruel man, a religious fanatic, an asshole, etc. One thing you can not call him is a bad untalented filmmaker. In fact you can't even call him a mediocre one. The man is a genius! A film-making genius! Those of you who think I'm insensitive for saying this seeing as though the actor turned director's anti-semetic public behavior, I say I'm not insensitive, I'm objective! Stalin was a terrible man, but if for some reason he made the movie 'Pulp Fiction', I'd admire him as a filmmaker. There I said it! I'd admire Stalin if he made 'Pulp Fiction'. Well, I'd admire his talent, not his personal life. This is important in reviewing a movie, not to be subjective. I was 100% objective while screening 'Apocalypto' and I have to say it was not only of the most enjoyable and enthralling movie experiences of my life, but it's also one of the only films I reward my rare '5-star' rating to. This is Mel Gibson's masterpiece, and all I will tell you about the film is that it's about the Mayan civilization. THAT'S IT! You have to go see it for yourself.OOPS, and also addressing the VIOLENCE controversy of 'Apocalypto'. This is blown totally out of proportion. Yes, 'Apocalypto' is a very bloody movie but certainly not worse than a lot of the films that are released like Kill Bill, Gladiator, GoodFellas, Natural Born Killers or the infamous Passion of the Christ (another Gibson film). 'Apocalypto' is just getting slammed for it's violence because of the vendettas the press has with Gibson. Anything to put the man down, even if it means unfairly criticizing a monumental piece of film-making. Also, in 'Apocalypto's' defense, the violence in this movie is not mean-spirited like in mafia shoot 'em up movies. It's used here in this society as a form of survival, and without the heavy amount of violence, 'Apocalypto' would lose one pre-eminent aspect that makes it so brilliant -- REALISM. It was a violent time back in those cultures -- YOU THINK AN ENTIRE CULTURE LIKE THAT GOT OVERTHROWN BY PEOPLE SAYING 'PLEASE' AND 'THANK YOU'?! F_CK NO! People took things by force.In conclusion, 'Apocalypto' is an excellent film, but not the best film of the year. In my mind 2006 is without question the best year for movies in 20 years, and 'Babel', 'The Departed' and 'Flags of Our Fathers' all are a tiny bit superior to Gibson's 'Apocalypto'. Like I said before, it's Mel Gibson's masterpiece. Grade: A",Apocalypto
137,mukava991,powerful but implausible,6,16 July 2007,"Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is the result of gazillions of dollars and years of toil spent purportedly to tell an allegorical story about a society in decline - in this case, the Maya in the 16th century. As in ""The Passion of the Christ,"" the actors speak the historically correct language of the characters they play; subtitles effectively convey the meaning of the brief verbal exchanges. This technique enhances the illusion of witnessing a distant time and place. The minutiae of daily life, whether in the tribal village or the urban center, are represented with painstaking realism and detail.The narrative itself is comic-book simple: A young jungle tribesman, Jaguar Paw, is taken captive by intruders from another tribe, marched along with other captives through the jungle to a city to be sacrificed to bloodthirsty gods but escapes under deus-ex-machina circumstances, with his captors on his heels. However, there are some improbabilities in the scenario. First, the march through the jungle apparently takes about a day, but the captives react to the city as if they had traveled hundreds of miles to an unknown land. The Mayan obsession with astronomy, at the core of their civilization, is not explored - it just sits there as A Fact. Even though they could chart celestial movements centuries before or after they occurred, Gibson's Maya priests apparently had no idea that a total solar eclipse (lasting, it seems, less than a minute from start to finish!) would occur precisely as they were about to sacrifice the protagonist to their gods. The simplemindedness of this concept brings to mind the 1947 comedy "" Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,"" wherein Bing Crosby travels back in time to medieval England and just as he is about to be dispatched by King Arthur's executioners he is able to distract them by predicting an imminent solar eclipse that just happens to be taking place on that very day; this he knows because he also just happened to surreptitiously consult an astronomical almanac that he happens to have left in his pocket prior to his time traveling. The Mayas' desperate, bloody human sacrifices were integrally connected to their terror of something going wrong in the surrounding cosmos resulting in destruction of their civilization. Gibson distorts this curious central component of the ritual, rendering it commonplace. They could just as well have been sacrificing in hope of a generous rainy season.There are striking sequences, some very engaging performances, crisp, to-the-point dialogue and dazzling cinematography. There is even humor - sometimes at the level of the Three Stooges (it's no mere coincidence that Gibson produced a TV movie about that slap happy trio). But Gibson knows that there will always be an audience for the cheap thrills of extreme violence and nail-biting chases; they require no thought, no participation by the audience. They are ""entertaining"" in the way a chocolate fudge-butterscotch-caramel-marshmallow-brownie sundae with flaming sugar cubes and whipped cream is delicious. But try eating them one after another for two and a half hours. After a while the ceaseless action sequences become laughable. It is said that life was indeed brutal in those days. Yes, but no human being could survive the type of continuous abuses suffered by the protagonist in this film. No matter what Gibson says, life isn't now and never was just a series of climaxes a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" By marrying the serial adventure genre to the historical epic, Gibson gives birth to..... an action-chase movie set against the backdrop of an ancient exotic civilization. It could just as well have been set against any backdrop at all.But there is an elemental power to much of Gibson's film-making. One only wishes he could someday harness his talents and passions to a more substantial concept.",Apocalypto
138,loganx-2,"Anti-Semite -Yes, Good Filmmaker....",8,9 July 2007,"I was really surprised. I liked it. It was a really good action film, I've heard it's all grossly inaccurate, but the theme of the story is about aggressive civilizations being eventually dominated by more aggressive civilizations, on macro and micro levels. There's stuff about greed, nature, and fear mongering, but it's all sub-text, on the surface it's just an adventure story, and minimizing the historical scale of the film to a single point of view works much the same way it does in Children Of Men, and how it does not in Marie Antionette. Regardless of Mel Gibson's personal idiocy, the fact is this film is works on several levels. This isn't the passion of Christ and this isn't Braveheart, this isn't a South American history lesson, it's just an allegory, and an increasingly important one, in the ever more globalized world we live in.",Apocalypto

In fact, I couldn't tell you if all of the characters were Mayan or if other tribal peoples were represented as well. What I CAN tell you is that the movie is visually stunning and entertaining. I don't believe the gore was overdone or gratuitous. Much of the second half of the movie did remind me of the classic ""The Naked Prey,"" but I enjoyed that movie as well, and it's about due for a remake anyway.Don't rent Apocalypto if you expect to be educated, but do rent it if you want to be entertained. Mel Gibson's movies are the product of passion, and it always shows. I'm looking forward to the next one.",Apocalypto
140,ClaytonDavis,Even better than Braveheart,10,14 December 2006,"Apocalypto Apocalypto is Mel Gibson's greatest achievement since Braveheart. As a matter of fact, it's his greatest of achievement of his career. The foreign language film spoken in the Mayan dialect is pitch perfect from its opening sequence to its gut wrenching climax. Besides the beautiful yet insanely tragic story being told its best qualities lie in its technical works.The film tells the story of a Mayan tribe headed by the swift and wise, Flint Sky whom get overtaken by a Maya kingdom who feel they must offer more temples and human sacrifices to gain prosperity with the Gods. When dozens upon dozens of women, children, and men are killed and taken, Flint Sky's courageous son Jaguar Paw places his pregnant wife and son in deep hole to keep the safe from the bloody battle that was occurring. When Jaguar Paw is captured with the rest of his people, his wife and son are left in a helpless state without food and water and with Jaguar Paw helpless himself and slated for human sacrifice he is more relentless and determined to get back to his family. When Jaguar Paw escapes and has a ""platoon"" to say the least gunning for him we are locked into an action-filled and heartbreaking film experience. The way the film is shot, as if it were a documentary about wild men in the wilderness hunting prey on a Discovery Channel special following ""Shark Week"" is the definitely the most potent and surprisingly eye catching aspect of the film.Despite Gibson's recent outbursts of Anti-Semitics which of course is unacceptable, we cannot deny his artistic eye and his eagerness to awe the viewer to breathless moments. Rudy Youngblood who plays the powerful Jaguar Paw puts in a fine performance and among the top breakthrough performances of the year. Along with Youngblood, Morris Birdyellowhead who plays the wise Flint Sky gives a wonderful supporting turn. With all the action and drama-full moments, we even get some interesting and much needed comic relief in the film.Oscar consideration would warrant Gibson and his film among the final five of the year but honestly, that is not happening. It can find its way in the categories of Makeup, Cinematography, Score, and Film Editing. I cannot wait for Gibson's next project, whatever that may be.Grade: ****/****",Apocalypto
141,Flagrant-Baronessa,Mad Max in the jungle,6,11 February 2007,"Allow me to be perfectly frank and explain the film in the way that I interpreted it. Mel Gibson has no interest whatsoever in the Mayan culture. He does not want to explore their ways on film. He never gets down to explore the nature of violence between them. He wants to explore the violence of nature amongst them. Here is a director who is altogether mesmerized by bloodlust as seen in all of his previous directorial efforts, and it aptly translates into the gruesome gore seen in ""Apocalypto"". Over and over again.In one of the first scenes of the film, a band of Mayan hunters track down and kill a tapir in the lush Yucutan jungle. When they sit down to feast on the prey, some of the guys convince a fellow hunter called Blunted to eat the animal's testicles to cure his infertility. Soon they all crack up and confess they were pulling his leg. Next comes a penis joke. Mel Gibson uses this type of locker-room humour to ground the otherwise alien Mayan culture and make us nod with recognition, clumsily telling us that ""they are just like you and me"". That is by far the most advanced anthropological angle taken in ""Apocalypto"" and it shows the laziness with which Gibson and Safinia approached the story.The remaining depiction is of the decline of the Mayan empire due to internal rivalry between tribes, as told in the prelude by a Will Durant quote: ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" No satisfactory explanation as to why or how this happens is ever offered, for Gibson is too preoccupied with brainless bloodshed, other than the leering faces of the caricatures of villains in foreign tribes who go to great lengths to punish warriors and sacrifice humans for their gods.One of these is young family man Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) who is captured and brought to a warring city, ready to be made a human sacrifice in one of their temples. By what can only be described as a fluke and apt physique, he manages to flee and sets off into the jungle to save his pregnant wife and his son who hid themselves in a well near their home-town and cannot climb up again  and it's starting to rain. Inexplicably, the evil villains chase Jaguar Paw through the whole jungle, over waterfalls, across mudpits, etc.Mel Gibson may be a crazed redneck, but when he finally divorces his highbrow introspective style from adrenaline-pumping cat-and-mouse action in the jungle, ""Apocalypto"" receives a well-deserved kick up the arse and switches to heartstopping manhunt mode. It becomes ""Predator"" or ""Mad Max"" in the Yucutan jungle, and is fully passable because of it. You could make a good case for the exploitation and over-dosage of blood & gore in the film and at the risk of sounding un-PC, this film made me pretty disgusted with Mayans. At one point, ""Apocalypto"" is almost disturbingly violent, brutal, gory and bloodthirsty for no other reason than to instill the ""bad guy"" image in our evil-laughing villains.On the action side of the spectrum, ""Apocalypto"" succeeds very well. There is the usual no character development, only here is stretches across 2+ hours. The lead character is your usual gazes-in-disbelief protagonist, but it's all so lowbrow you cannot help but appreciate it. If you do not mind a bit of gaping wounds, internal organs being ripped out, piercing in the most random and painful places, human sacrifices, animals fights, gushing streams of blood, open arteries, bony freaks of nature, face-munching by panthers, gutting of animals, gruesome bloodbaths, torture games, rotting corpses, self-mutilation and last but not least, death by killer bees, this film may be for you.My one regret with the film is that is cannot decide if it wants to opt for and clumsily pends between both: 1) hard-boiled action with superb crisp direction and exotic sets or 2) high-brow cultural/religious exploration of a civilization with lead-footed direction. Needless to say, ""Apocalypto"" fares infinitely better when Mel Gibson stick to the former approach, something that is true of all his films.6 out of 10",Apocalypto
142,rdoyle29,An incredible action epic,8,28 October 2017,"Jaguar Paw's (Rudy Youngblood) life as a hunter is shattered when a group of warrior's invade his village and kill and/or kidnap everyone. He manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son, but he is abducted and taken to the Mayan capital. The capital has been stricken with famine and disease, so the high priests are sacrificing hundreds of men to appease their sun god. Jaguar Paw manages to escape, but is pursued through the jungle by a group of warriors as he tries to return to his wife. This is a very effective action film. It's a long film, but it never really feels it. A lot of the criticism focuses on the pretty graphic violence. Yes, it's quite graphic, but it doesn't feel gratuitous. It's a film about the end of a way of life, and as such, a certain amount of horrific spectacle feels appropriate. I think some folks find it difficult to separate their feelings about Gibson from their feelings about his films. I'm not fond of the main either, and I do think his obsession with graphic violence is coming from an ugly place, but that doesn't make it inappropriate in all cases.",Apocalypto
143,socrates99,I couldn't believe two hours had gone by that quickly,9,8 December 2006,"Having some Mexican-Indian blood in me, I've always been interested in what I could read about the Aztecs and Mayans and others. But never did I achieve as elaborate a vision in my head, try as I might, as Mel Gibson has with the beautiful Apocalypto. Is it accurate? I've more than just strong doubts in at least one case, but like all good fiction, it probably tells more truth, despite its inaccuracies, than a dozen scholarly tomes. The movie is engrossing and, even more difficult, plausible and quite evocative. I would have bet any amount of money that this movie was impossible to make. And though some have complained that the film's ending involves an historical inaccuracy, I think there was more than enough reason to put it in.There's a strong story that reminded me of other Third World folklore I've read, only better. In a lot of ways these people could have been North American Indians, but somehow that's not much of a criticism. And Gibson's recent PR problems only highlighted, for me, how it took an Australian-reared actor to make an exciting film about natives before Columbus. Clearly Hollywood is incapable of even conceiving of such a movie, much less bringing it brilliantly to life. Hollywood has an agenda and very narrow perspectives. It's agenda has no room for illuminating the humanity of non-Westerners, and there's too much relying on the same old set of sensibilities and intuition. I think if Hollywood is up in arms it ought to be because Gibson is making them look inept.But as to this particular subject matter, there's no doubt in my mind that what fascinates most Anglos about the Aztecs and the Maya is the idea of human sacrifice. Gibson depicts the ritual as having an element of frenzy to it, and he may be right, but what is more convincing to me, at least, is his idea of what a village raid must have been like. His point by point reconstruction is pretty compelling, and I'm quite sure he could make some early American military raids on Indian villages so vivid and unforgettable that grown men would cry. I only hope he does, but as to this film, I would have depicted the human sacrifice with a nod toward a notion most Anglos find completely foreign, namely that these people understood that gain often entails pain, and they were willing to pay the price. Was it really so unreasonable that these people thought God might want them to create pain, and not just endure it, to gain His favor given that life entails so much struggle anyway? That willingness to endure pain clearly survives today, not the desire to create it in others, and that's the only point I would have added to this wonderful film.",Apocalypto

There was very little plot to speak of, and the second half of the film is about a guy being chased in the forest.I don't mind seeing graphic violence if there's a point to it (like in ""Passion of the Christ""), but here it was completely gratuitous and completely pointless...i.e., violence for violence sake.",Apocalypto

The amazing thing about this one is that he actually managed to get Americans to read subtitles. That is a feat, but it does not make a film profound. In its own genre, I give it a mediocre rating. Everyone knows how it will end up by halfway through. The condensed anthropology and history are rather comic-book in nature. It's amazing that several hundred years could be so easily condensed into a week. This is how the masses like their history.

148,dilbertsuperman,Zionist Pieces of Crap are trying to suppress this incredible movie.,9,26 January 2007,"Mel said some things that were anti-semitic when he was drunk and under duress. Ever since then there has been a coordinated media campaign by Zionist journalists to desperately attempt to convince the nation that they should not watch this movie because it sucks. What an obvious McCarthy era style censorship by the elite.Well- don't believe the zion hype of the big five that own all of your media. Mel delivers the goods in this movie. Think of ""last of the mohicans"" on crack. The violence is brutal but there is SO MUCH MORE to this movie, it has very tender moments incredible scenery and costuming and great acting as well.The scenery is stunning so get out and see this on the big screen- but I will warn you- this is a visual visceral movie- this is a sensory experience- it is not a complicated plot with characters you necessarily understand.The richness of the visuals of the various tribal peculiarities in relation to dress and piercings and war paint is just incredible. Of course, I had to wonder if the costumes and styles of hair etc were all 100% accurate or if they just kind of jumbled together 50 different tribes and picked the most dramatic stuff from each one.Weapons were authentic the atl atl was used and the good ol mayan club as well as the obsidian knives. This movie accurately captures the feeling of being in the jungle and also the warrior spirit.If you are a suburban mother you won't get this movie at all. If you like watching fights and action- you will fully understand the primal surge this movie can give you.Some moments in the movie lag a bit and there was a scene with a cat that I found the special effects rather lacking to the point of comedy- you will know it when you see it.The city was well done but there were so many other details they could have thrown in there as plot twists but I guess they crammed as much as they could in- their culture is richer probably than ours could ever be.THE PLOT: a tribe is attacked by another tribe and the drama of ripping families apart and being taken off as slaves ensues. The lead does a great acting job in this- all of the acting is solid. This movie has no English dialog- it is all subtitles but you get used to it quick and that was a good choice by mel- it keeps the vibe very primal and tribal.",Apocalypto
149,nobbytatoes,an action film lies at its heart,6,19 January 2007,"When holding Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ and Braveheart side by side, a question comes to mind; Is Mel Gibson a vampire? He likes blood, Passion has it free flowing, but beside his pasty complexion on his mug shots, maybe he isn't one. But Gibson could be called an emotional vampire, with these three films sucking every emotion out till there's nothing but depressing emotions to go with the depressing state of affairs found in his films.Apocalypto starts at the decline of the Mayan civilisation. Disease and famine are hitting hard, with the rulers demanding more human sacrifices to appease their Gods. Their hunters pillage surrounding villages to capture the inhabitants to be use for the sacrifice; their heart ripped from the body and head decapitated. From one of the villages, Jaguar Paw is captured along with his friends and family. To escape from being sacrificed, Jaguar Paw flees, though in hot pursuit.Apocalypto can easily be split into two sections. To start off, opening part runs as a some what comedy. The village Mayan's play practical jokes on each other and shows Juguar Paw as the family man with expecting wife and young son. Used as an easement to the second part, this start is off and doesn't click. Sexual jokes and the mother badgering her son in law to produce a grand child miss their marks, adding to the facade of what Apocalypto really is. Even during the pillage of the village the action doesn't hold the emotional detrimental effects wanted. On the arrival at the stone temple city Mayan's, we hit the bridge to the second part, the mood changes to a deeply ethereal atmosphere. Dread fills the captives, as their fate is shown off in the distance as heads roll down from the temples. The mood is suffocating and taunt and quite a visceral moment.Hitting the second part, this is when all the gears synchronize and reveal what this film really is, an action film. On Juguar Paw's escape and pursuit of his captors, Apocalypto becomes a chase film, and this is what it's most effective as. The drama missing a lot of resonance, besides the time of the sacrifices, and the wonderful cinematography taking over from the story at times, the second part works so well due to the exceptionally stage set pieces. A draw back is that the chase suffers from predictability, as people are picked off one by one and a race against time for Juguar Paw to save his wife, but is easily forgone due to Gibson's craft as a film maker and the fast pace and unrelenting pursuit Juguar Paw suffers. The violence is also used to a visceral extent. The gore and blood isn't as high as people hyped too. Yes blood is splattered freely and Gibson doesn't turn from the gore, but there's restraint, from the all out gore fest of Passion.The drama aspect of Apocalypto lacks the emotional impact and the comparison between the decline of the Mayan civilisation and modern day society may not make a mark on many; it's there to dig out, but behind everything, lies the heart of a well staged action film.",Apocalypto
150,Scars_Remain,Not the Greatest but Still Pretty Good,8,8 September 2008,"Now I had heard that this movie was not only a candidate for the greatest movie of all time but also the most gory. It doesn't even come close to either of those feats as there are plenty of flaws and the gore is so held back. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy this film thoroughly. It's a very well done and thought out film with very good action and suspense.Mel Gibson is a good director, he may be insane in real life but no one can deny that he knows how to make a film(I feel like that episode of South Park right now). The acting is great and Rudy Youngblood gives a phenomenal performance. I was also very impressed to read that some of the parts were done by locals who had never acted in their lives.The story is good and really follows through. I honestly think it could have been a good amount shorter though. It seems like so much time was wasted in running and just scenes being dragged out when they didn't need to be. I felt like the point was established long before many of the scenes let up. Other than that, I thought the story was well done.Some of the shots in this one are breathtaking with the amazing visuals and landscapes. The sets are also incredible. I thought the violence was decent but nothing we haven't seen in a lot of major Hollywood releases.

151,OttoVonB,One of the best B-movies ever!,9,23 January 2007,"Let's address the main complaint surrounding this film so we can get it out of the way: ""Apocalypto"" should really be called ""Jaguar Paw's Worst Day Ever"". That would be more on the mark, because Gibson's epic gives little explanation to why this civilization crumbled and focuses on an outsider's discovery of it at its most corrupt. Then, there is the trademark Gibson violence. In fact, ""Apocalypto"" is tamer than the ""Passion"" and its violence is far more appropriate.Jaguar Paw and his peaceful tribe of hunters live their life in the American jungle, before a Mayan war party crashes in, destroys the village and captures most of its inhabitants. From the off-set, Gibson handles his cast well, applying the ancient language with the same success as in ""The Passion"". Thankfully, the characters aren't burdened by their religious weight and significance, and the hole cast feels more alive. During the raid, Jaguar Paw successfully hides his pregnant wife and young son in a cave before being caught. What follows is with little doubt the worst day anyone ever had, from a long, perverse slave walk to the Mayan capital, to a humiliating slave market to the nightmarish executions. This nightmarish trip through Mayan corruption takes an unexpected turn when Jaguar Paw's head is on the chopping block, only for his life to be saved by a flamboyant Deus ex-machina plot development. The Mayans then choose to ""let remaining the prisoners go"" (i.e.: releasing them and killing them as they run off), in one of the film's best scenes. What follows, as Jaguar Paw escapes this trial, is an intense, long, violent man-hunt.On to the finer aspects. Yes Mr Gibson likes his violence, so we should thank God he is so good at portraying it. He also likes his plot simple and to the point, in the pure adventure style, which doesn't hurt. The film allows itself a few subtexts (deliberate religious manipulation of the masses, the corrupting nature of revenge), but the most telling motif in Gibson's growing filmography is the primal importance of family. What keeps people human is their devotion to loved ones, a touching and refreshingly apolitical theme for the new century. Gibson's use of long-gone languages and casts of unknowns again gives his film a sense of authenticity that will probably lead to a surge of interest in this old civilization. How can you fault a man who sends people to their books, eager for knowledge? At heart, ""Apocalypto"" is a bombastic adventure film, great on the action, beautiful and grotesque at the same time, occasionally trashy (with a few outlandish moments, such as a hilarious birth scene), but boasting a proud, unique identity.Definitely worth seeing!",Apocalypto
152,gary-444,Exciting jungle tale,8,8 August 2014,"This is an extraordinarily ambitious work whose successful delivery is entirely the result of the will , determination, and vision of Director Mel Gibson. A story of Mayans, set in a South American jungle, with unknown actors and sub titles is not one which would routinely attract a big budget, but Gibson's powers of persuasion must be considerable, and are vindicated.In the 1950's and 1960's Tarzan and jungle films set in Africa were very popular with audiences drawn to the exotic locations, wild animals, primitive lifestyles and unusual practises. Gibson draws on these themes then adds a simple but effective tale of bravery and jeopardy.Jaguar Paw, superbly played by Rudy Youngblood, is a young man whose village is raided by a rival tribe. His father is killed in front of him whilst the village is razed and slaughtered, he is captured along with a handful of others, but not before he is able to hide his pregnant wife and child down a sinkhole from which escape unaided appears impossible.The reason why prisoners have been taken is they are to be sacrificed to the gods setting the scene for a grandstand killing. Jaguar Paw however manages to escape, desperate to rescue his family as it starts to rain, threatening them with drowning.Casual, brutal, violence litters this film, but so does excitement and drama. From the start, the injustices of the attack need to be righted, and Jaguar Paw's heroism needs to be rewarded. Death is never far away. Danger is always imminent. If Quentin Tarrantino had directed Avatar, it might have looked like this. Apocalypto is superb, violent, majestic, disturbing and compelling.",Apocalypto

Contrary to the Establishment view that the Christian world ruined pure pastoral Indians in their primordial splendor, the Indigenes practised some rituals which might have made war criminals blush. Yet thereby they were destroying themselves. That seems to be the point of Mel's movie and a point well taken.I cannot agree with The Establishment that Christianity was a negative influence in North America.Much of the criticism of The Establishment is that Mel's histories: Braveheart, The Patriot, The Passion are too bloody for their tastes.I can't understand their anti - sanguinary feeling. They themselves blithely commence and cheer on wars, albeit without the awe and spectacle of ritualized mass murder, in blissful denial of all the suffering they cause.I gave the movie a ""6.""

155,Meven_Stoffat,"Action Packed, Flawless, and Adrenaline filled",10,21 April 2007,"Little said, I had almost no expectations when going to see Apocalypto in the theater. I knew it was going to be a movie about the Mayan civilization's decline from what I had seen in the trailers. And what I got was an action packed adventure from the mind of Mel Gibson (Director of ""The Passion of the Christ"").Apocalypto begins with a group of Mayan hunters chasing after a boar in the forest. They luckily kill the boar, and each person is given a part of the Boar to eat. As a prank, one is given the testicles (ew). He eats the testicles and nearly pukes. Then we see a group of Mayans come in and warn them about what is to come. After that, we see inside the life of Jaguar Paw. He is a man with a wife and kid. His wife is pregnant, and she has a kid. The next day, an Evil Mayan Army comes in and chooses men for sacrifice while their wives are raped. The people chosen for Sacrifice are led to the Mayan temples, where people's heads are chopped off and the bodies sent down the stairways, and the hearts are cut out and burnt. Somehow, Jaguar Paw is set free because of an eclipse, and after a deadly test, runs for his life. Then that marks the entry into the action packed second half.Jaguar Paw runs in the forest from the Mayans in order to get back to his pregnant wife and son hiding in a hole, and he manages to escape the Mayans, no matter what. There is a scene where he hides in a tree...only to find a Jaguar behind him. Now how do you say ""Holy Crap"" in Maya? Jaguar Paw grows stealth and skills, and as the time nears that he gets back to his wife and son, he must defeat the Mayans.This is a totally awesome action ride. The effects and action are done, and the chases rock. The Chases are all done on foot, and are the best chase scenes I ever saw.However, this is NOT for the squeamish. But otherwise, prepare to have your adrenaline pumping in this 2 hour action ride.",Apocalypto
156,pkpera,Was whole movie about that W. Durant is wrong ?,9,25 April 2021,"Here are some my thoughts, some 14 years after first watching this, in theater, and that's right place for visual masterpiece like this. Well, today little less true thanx to progress and lower prices of home video, and today's 'apocalypse' covid.Great approach - native language, not engaging some blonde 45 years old to play Indian (remember Nevada Smith ?), but real - dare to say ancestors ... And yes, this is mostly action movie, lot of blood, violence. But behind it is story of family. Culture, civilization ..Climax is one of bests ever made in any movie.And that's what made me thinking about some things, over years, in fact.So, movie starts with quote of W. Durant. What is interesting, and I did not see that someone mentioned it: it was printed with some shadow like, shifted copy of it below. And yes, there were things shown about internal degradation of Mayan civilization, especially in cities. What made lot of people to move to better place (remember New York, seventies, eighties) .And we are at the end scenes, where something new for people on that continent approaches. The big question is: was fall of Mayan civilization (and others on continent) result of ""destroying itself from within"", or better said, had it some relevant influence in oncoming apocalypse - for them, possible mostly because something loud, what one of approaching people held with his hand ?And to add, something on same base, larger, more loud had crucial role in final conquering of Constantinopolis .",Apocalypto
157,ExpendableMan,Nothing but a disappointment,3,29 May 2007,"Set entirely in the jungles of South America, the most notable thing about Apocalypto is the setting. American film makers haven't exactly been making regular excursions into the rain-forest to document the history of the people, so to see an expensive Hollywood film, directed by a troubled star cum Christian fundamentalist, filled with a cast of unknowns who don't speak a single word of English and detailing the collapse of the proud Mayan civilisation should be enough to prick up the ears of any regular cinema goer. Shame then that Apocalypto is nowhere near as good as it should have been. Promising to be an epic but never fulfilling its potential, all it really amounts to is a gory action film. It might be better than The Passion of the Christ, but that's not saying much and there is a distinct feeling that this was a wasted opportunity.The story opens with a group of tribesmen hunting in the forest, including the main character Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood). Jaguar and his mates are members of a very happy community; an idyllic little village where children frolic without a care, women clean houses with utter contentment etched on their faces and the men laugh and enjoy life together while, uh...mercilessly bullying one of their mates. From the get go, you can see the intention was to humanise an essentially primitive people, but instead it winds up being relentlessly corny. Everything is so perfect in this corner of the world that you half expect someone to turn around and mention how awful it would be if a troupe of heavily armed mercenaries turned up to ruin everything.Faster than you can say ""Quetzalcoatl,"" everything has gone to hell. Half the village gets murdered, the women raped, the adults enslaved and the children left to fend in the wilderness for themselves. Leaving his heavily pregnant wife and son hidden in a pit, Jaguar Paw and co get marched off by the mercenaries to the aforementioned Mayan city, where they are set to be sacrificed in a decidedly messy style to the Gods in order to stop whatever it is that is causing the Empire to collapse. After a painfully long set up though, it turns out that we're not in for a story that takes in years of slavery, escape, revolution and redemption but a chase film. Yes, that's it. Jaguar Paw manages to give his captors the slip and runs off into the jungle, with the mercenaries chasing after him.It's an incredibly frustrating change of pace and while there is admittedly, fun to be had watching the pursuers find ever more interesting ways to die, there's a very strong feeling that Gibson couldn't work out what to do with everyone once he got them to the top of the sacrificial pyramid. His love of gore overshadows everything as well and like the Passion before it, Apocalypto is splattered with crimson. By the finish, it's practically dripping off the camera lens. It might be fun in a guilty pleasure sort of way, but it has more in common with exploitation cinema than perhaps they'd like to admit.Shame really, because the Mayan civilisation promised a rich period of history that has otherwise been unexplored on film. That total may have increased by one, but all Apocalypto can tell us about an entire race of people whose civilisation existed for centuries is that they like to dismember people and bounce severed heads down flights of stairs like basketballs. And just to add icing to the cake, the pregnancy angle illustrates aptly how distorted Gibson's perception of the world is. How? Well, he seems to think that when a baby in the womb kicks the mother, her stomach bulges out like John Hurt, only without the blood flying everywhere and a horrendous alien monster emerging. Avoid.",Apocalypto
158,christian94,Minimalist animalism,7,22 January 2007,"Mel Gibson gave us three period epic films. Nothing was too big for the fierce field battles of 13th century Scotland in the cornerstone Braveheart. Nothing was too gruesome for the torture Christ had to endure in the 1st century A.D. in the controversial The Passion of Christ. Nothing was too unimportant to be incorporating in this simple adventure tale set in 16th century Mayan civilization. Yet as simple as the story may be, the accuracy of detail steaming both from obvious research and palpable love Mel exhibits for his work and the underlying ethereal sense, realization and questioning about human society, human civilization, human nature and human's place in nature is quite on point and reach deeper level of introspection than his previous work. The movie is flawed mostly in the way that an action/adventure movie is trapped by the need to exaggerate good & evil, keep the narrative propelled by more or less contrived plot twists and focus more on form than content. However, when looking at the underlying themes and going as far as exploring the basis of dogma as an effective population-controlling mechanism and contrasting different level of societal progression with ethical & pragmatic considerations for both the individuals and the society as a whole, this movie raises the right questions and the adventure becomes a facade for deeper exploration of the well-created world.Go see this movie not for the thrill of a chase in the Mayan jungle or the gore of decapitated tribesmen, but as an explorer into another time and another world. A world frighteningly not too dissimilar to the world we know...",Apocalypto
159,Jacques98,"So much for realism, so much for life. (Or: there was a reason this was in the drama section of Blockbuster.)",1,15 October 2008,"Though I somewhat like Mel Gibson as an actor, everything he directs, maybe with the exception of The Passion, is just ridiculously predictable and entirely pointless. Not to mention historically inaccurate and boring. Apocalypto is a slight advancement for him as a director, but, really, that amounts to nothing because he simply cannot write a script that isn't a wholesale cliché within a cliché. That problem is the major problem with Apocalyptowho would have guessed? Let me put it this way: there are thousands of movies out there with the man-must-save-family plot line. After watching any more than two of those movies, you realize they're all the exact same as one another. Same flat men characters. Same helpless wives. Same little kid who is just there as a prop to make all the parents get emotional at the thought of their own child being in that situation. Every man-must-save-family movie is exactly like the others, and Apocalypto does nothing whatsoever to set itself apart from that generalization I just made. At all. Jaguar Paw is exactly like every other cliché father in every other movie. For once, can't a father just say ""Oh well"" when his family is kidnapped and just go become a potted plants salesman instead of becoming some sort of cliché superhero? I can guarantee that is more realistic of what a lot of fathers would do in that situation.Second major problem was with the directing. This movie reminded me so much of Napoleon Dynamite, it's almost as if Mel used the same script but used Mayans and added a man-must-save-family plot. Why does it remind me so much of Napoleon Dynamite? Because the majority of the screen time is just characters staring at each other with dumb looks on their faces. Characters take almost a full minute to reply to each others dialogue. If they cut out every awkward staring scene, the movie would literally be an hour shorter. I don't know if it's the actor's faults, or if Mel Gibson literally told them all ""Okay, guys, stare at each other like dumb animals before saying your lines!"" every take.I think that pretty much says what I'm going to say about the pacing of this film. It's insanely slow. Anyone who is calling this an action movie, let alone ""the perfect action movie"", have never seen a true action movie or a true thriller. No, this is a drama, through and through. The last half hour has a long chase scene, but it is just the same trees and close-up of Jaguar Paw re-looping over and over again, as if you're fooled into thinking something is actually happening. All I can say to people who compare this to 300 is: ""Huh . . .?"" That brings me to the level of violence that it seems everyone is complaining about. Did I watch the same movie? I thought this could have easily gotten a PG-13, considering that the three Lord of the Rings movies are just as violent as this, but got a PG-13 rating. If you think Apocalypto even is half as violent as the R-rated cuts of Saw III or Hostel: Part II (both of which I thought were tame in the first place), you need your head examined. There is a little blood in the end, and maybe a few PG-13-ish beating scenes, and that's about it. A lot of the major injuries don't even bleed! I member Mel commenting on the violence calling it ""brutal like real life"", but, seriously, come on now. Is he joking? The camera cut away every time someone was PUNCHED, much less decapitated. There was nothing more graphic about any of the violence in Apocalypto than Pirates of the Caribbean (PG-13). Also, I for one am sick of the cliché attempted rapes scenes that happen in every movie like this, and then people say it was so ""disgusting"". If a director is going to put rape in his movie, he should put it in full, graphic detail. That's slightly disturbing. Some guy pushing a woman and laughing (and implying rape) isn't disturbing in the least. When a director like Mel Gibson calls his movie disturbing, I hold him to it. The only single thing that is disturbing about Apocalypto are all the naked men butts. Now THAT is gross. The violence, on the other hand, was just cute at worst.In the end, do you remember those documentaries you had to watch in middle school about the Mayans? This isn't any more interesting or action-packed than those. While movies like 300 take history and put it in the form of a slightly mature fantasy with actual action, Apocalypto just repeats boring scenes you've seen a thousand times.0/10",Apocalypto
160,stormhawk2021,Excellent mayan drama,10,25 May 2017,"If the attraction of films is immersion into another reality, this bad boy fills the bill and then some, on steroids. We go to the heart of the South American jungle at the start of the decline of the Mayan civilization, just before the arrival of invading Europeans, and Mel Gibson's evocation of the times puts to shame nearly every historical epic before, very nearly the history lesson of teachers' dreams, and then there's the story of a simple family man trying to survive in a violent world. Gibson may well be the D.W. Griffith of his time, emboding sensational film making and bad politics simultaneously ... but so what? Hollywood needs to forgive him. I have.Although slow and sometimes difficult to understand, this is truly a visual masterpiece with so many brilliant performances it's hard to choose who to credit first. A fantastic voyage of a story which integrates you with these people and allows you to feel part of the gang; but then that's all spoiled by the ending which confuses my sense of time. At first it seems to be of the Mayan era but then the ships come along with a completely different period of clothing. I'm not sure if this was intentional to show that such barbarism was still in full swing in 'modern' times or to just be annoying. Good film though.",Apocalypto

And there's scenes and lines blatantly stolen from other movies, but it's in context and it works. As with all big budget films one will need to overlook a few silly lines and impossible scenarios. This is no exception. Visually striking , uncompormisingly vicious and relentlessly exciting, this movie will transport you to a vibrant, colorful landscape inhabited by people that quite frankly frighten and enlighten but never fail to entertain. Powerful and moving. Some choppy editing in scenes which I wasn't sure worked effectively. It didn't work for me anyway. The music and costumes were immaculate. No weak link in the entire cast except maybe the young boy, son of our lead character. I give it a 7.5. Some of the scenes were way too long and drawn out to make a very simple point, and I felt that was needless padding although easily brushed off. Some of the timing and coincidences were a bit eye rolling. You'll never see a more rapid eclipse in your life. Yet still an absorbing and fascinating glimpse into another time.

Apocalypto is a beautiful and graphic account of Jaguar Paw's dangerous journey across the lands of bloodthirsty Mayans as he is to be sacrificed to the Gods; but he escapes and the breathless chase begins as Jaguar runs from vicious Mayans to save his pregnant wife and child.

163,ikanboy,Spell binding and masterful movie!,9,8 December 2006,"After ""The Passion,"" I knew Mel Gibson was a maker of movies that could inspire, but that could also bog down in pointless repetitive messaging. This time around he manages to inspire and awe, while leaving the messaging to a short pointed scene - basically: ""watch out Honkie is coming"" - and manage to imbue that scene with the profound menace of it's accuracy.The movie takes place in some South American Jungle in the late 1400's. The people are primitive and basic and quite uncomplicated in their ability to merge gracefully in with their surroundings. Then along comes civilization, no not that one, the one before that one, and all the native innocence gets a rude and bloody awakening.Our hero - Jaguar Paw - manages to save his wife and son, before being captured. His captors are intent only on one thing, to take their prizes back to the Capital for the latest round of mass sacrifices.At some point our hero escapes and makes his way back to save his family pursued by a determined crew of assassins. Anybody whose seen: ""Naked Prey"" will be beholden to Mel for bringing back the chase scene in all of it's basic mano a mano intensity and heroics.What makes this movie stand out above the herd, though, is in it's insistence in mixing in pulsating action scenes with incredible sets and costumes, and as importantly as all of these, in it's insistence in keeping out any faces that might seem familiar. Yet the faces are soon etched for us by their superb acting. None of the main characters seem new to the craft, they are so well poised, and their mannerisms indelibly identify them as separate characters.The actors all speak in a native language, but the sub titles are not intrusive - unless you are illiterate or in remedial English - and at times unnecessary, as the story explains itself. Gibson makes the most of the sub titles to use pithy language, and the most of his actors use of the measured crackle of their language.Gibson has now shown himself to be in the same league as that other great Actor/Director, Clint Eastwood. His choices are extraordinary in their ability to keep the pace going while not detracting from one's attention to the screen. His recreation of the Incan (Mayan?) city will go down in movie making history as one of the great set pieces of all time.It is a bloody movie, and violent, and brutal, but it could not be otherwise. Unlike ""The Passion"" Gibson does not dwell on it, or rub it in, and allows it to be part of the scenery. Hey it's a jungle out there!",Apocalypto
164,Jay_Exiomo,Stunning realization of a vision,8,31 January 2007,"""Apocalypto"" is an example of how great a filmmaker Mel Gibson is - never mind the personal wrongdoings - as his latest film is a vision realized with stunning results.While the film's not devoid of the director's panache for violence, it manages to be more than just a drawn-out gore fest. Here, it's an adventure story stripped to the most cardinal level where the stunning production design of the Mesoamerican period, Dean Semler's cinematography and James Horner's score are enough to move the narrative forward without much help from the minimal screenplay.During the final days of the Mayan civilization, a young hunter named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), along with some other members of his village, is captured by an army of slave traders. They are brought atop a Mayan pyramid to be sacrificed to the gods with the captors hoping that their victims' blood would alleviate them of a plague that has them suffering. In some twists of fate, Jaguar Paw escapes and what ensues is a desperate race as he tries to return home to his family whom he managed to hide from the hunters, as well as evade the dangers that chase him, including his captors who now holds a vendetta against him.There is much realism throughout and Gibson succeeds in transporting the audience to a different world. The chase scene is one of the most fun I had in the movies for a while now. The cast, composed mostly of unknown actors, do a great job embracing their roles with substance. Youngblood, for instance, provides a lifelike vigor to his character while also delivering a believable emotional depth.It's not perfect, though. There are times when Gibson fails to recognize the value of restraint; the extreme violence gets the better of the end product and dampens the overall effect. But all things considered, it's a quibble that barely mars a well-directed film which only Gibson could've pulled off.",Apocalypto

The movie is simultaneously unusual and usual: The story about man's will to survive despite the odds (watch ""Crank"", made the same year, and you'll see the other extreme example; or ""Avatar"", for that matter), but placed in Mayan time. Gibson tries to be ""realistic"" with costumes, language and scenery, but since no one from that time lived to tell, it really doesn't matter. The movie is visually attractive and the actors performed almost perfectly (considering the circumstances; thus five stars). Mr. Gibson is also far better director than actor (none of which stands out by any standards). But that's it. A postcard from ""ancient"" Mexico. The verdict: Worth a look if you don't expect anything (and certainly not the Spanish Inquisition, which nobody expects) and do not take this seriously (as a ""document from Mayan era"").",Apocalypto
166,shadowman123,Amazing and interesting.,8,9 April 2007,"This for me has got to me Mel Gibson's finest directorial effort to date. From the guy who gave us The Passion Of The Chirst gives us Apocalyto! Set within the decline of the Mayan world , it tells the story of a young native who risks life and limb to save what he holds near and dear to him. From the trailers one is intrigued and thats what has really wanted me to go and check it out further, Mel Gibson does a masterful job of doing research on the life , times and languages of the Mayan culture (how historically accurate it actually is, that is debatable). The acting , make-up , scenery was brilliant and extra kudos for the actors for making the interaction seem so dame real! Anybody who has seen Passion of The Chirst will tell you that Gibson has a small penchant for blood and this is no exception here as we are shown blood by the loads and no holds barred violence. Rahat Fateh Ali Khan (family member of the great late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan) lends his voice for a chilling a haunting score. My only complaint was that it was a little over 2 hours long so it does require a clear, rigid mind if you are going to watch it however the film moves at such a fast pace your mind won't really wonder very far at all. To conclude Apocalypto may at the end of the day may just be another action movie , but having said it is an action movie which is like no other and shall leave you feeling intrigued , something that action movies hardly ever do for me.

167,Michael Fargo,"Boy, and I thought ""Hannibal"" was excessive....",4,12 December 2006,"Watching this film, I kept waiting for King Kong to arrive. This isn't a serious exploration of the Maya or much of anything. It's a raw horror/chase film and an amalgam of Mel's movies: ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Passion of the Christ,"" and particularly the ""Mad Max"" enterprise (plus a whole lot of other people's films). I don't dislike Mel Gibson. I just think he's confused his movie star persona (and taken the financial rewards) to give an intellectual gloss to his career. He's not a director. He imitates directors. ""Braveheart"" was a plagiarism of Branaugh's ""Henry V"" (with the addition of butt cheeks). Mel's obsession with that part of the male anatomy is on grand display here in ""Apocalypto."" I had hopes with Gibson's ""Patriot"" that some balance of the sadism that so appeals to Mel Gibson would be tempered and resolved. That hope was wrecked with ""Passion of the Christ."" It's fine for someone to take their earnings (or raise investment) and work out personal demons through directing films. I don't think it's okay for critics or the public to reward that as ""art.""

168,Ziya90,"Gibson, Run!",8,24 December 2009,"I have read a few thoughts and I will give some examples from those which are ridiculous, exaggerating and the most important malicious. ''Gibson forgot everything and now he gets Maya people kill each other. Why?'' Does this make any sense? Then? He had wanted to make a movie about Maya civilization and did. That's all. ''Gibson shows us Maya people as a barbarian civilization.'' A typical slander. Apocalypto was about savage tribes, wasn't it? Weren't they a barbarian civilization? ''Villagers are good, but the people who lived in the center are evil.'' What does it mean? All Maya people were angels, there was no fight, there was no struggle, there was no sacrifice rite, nobody died, nobody got hurt, always they lived in peace. Is this those people want to see? This would be to distort the facts. If they try to mean that the movie takes side with villagers, cannot be objective, well, is it important? or was Gibson really wrong, were the people lived in the center really innocent? ''The sacrificial rite is shown from the eyes of victims. This is a tradition.'' The most bizarre part. They try to say that Gibson takes sides with the victims, does not look at the rite from the eyes of the evil tribe and it is wrong. Sacrificing is a right attitude? According to them it is. ''Gibson is a director who is obsessed with characters suffer and try to confess their sins and who is obsessed with bloody adventures. He is also a deep catholic who is obsessed with Jesus.'' Ohh, No! Watch Braveheart as an epic, war movie. Watch Apocalypto as an adventure. Almost every director has some characteristics and there is nothing wrong with it. Their cinema feeds on it. It is like John Woo likes pigeons. Gibson likes characters who suffer and try to shrive? So what? He makes too bloody, violent movies? Then, why those people love George Romero's extremely hard zombie movies or Tarantino or Saw series? ''Apocalypto is obscure about being homophobic and being homo-erotic and Apocalypto consists of pornographic violence. I hate this term; pornographic violence, because I know that mostly it is used to slander! They were savage tribes who lived in an ancient age. Would have been better, if they had worn suit? If you get half naked men fight, then, your movie becomes an example of pornographic violence. Too many half naked men, testosterone, pornographic violence, pornographic violence. And is this something wrong too? In addition, Apocalypto is neither homophobic nor homo-erotic. There is not any kind of relationship between Gibson's movie and those terms at all. ''Apocalypto is Gibson's new violence fantasy, he does not use violence in order to stress any point, so it is unbearable."" Really? It is not a fantasy, he had wanted to make an adventure movie about Maya people and he did it, that's all. And for example Martin Scorsese does very violent movies, so it means that he is unbearable too? Gibson had had to put some violent, bloody material, otherwise, it would have seemed odd. What does Gibson try to tell us by using violence? He tells us Maya civilization, not enough? Gibson worked a lot for the language of the movie, it was translated. Who did appreciate him? Nobody. Apocalypto is an excellent adventure movie and in this sub genre, it is my favorite. Cinemaography, set designs are great, but the important thing is that the script is very well written, even if the movie is not deep.",Apocalypto
169,galensaysyes,The Uxmal Stoneaxe Massacre (but that's not a bad thing),10,23 April 2008,"And not only axe. The movie also offers death by spear, knife, arrow, bola, poison dart, spike, rock (bashing head against), jaguar tooth, and snake venom, as well as near-drowning (once by water, once by quicksand) and mutilation (the cutting out of hearts, the lopping off of heads). In other words, it's a survival horror movie, disguised as history to escape calumny. What it mainly is, however, is a blood-and-thunder adventure disguised as history, aimed at 14-year-old boys of a romantic and violent tendency (R rating notwithstanding). This is nothing against it: when a good movie happens along it usually is for 14-year-olds; and this one is extremely well done in that capacity. Having the dialogue in Mayan is a drag: it's too much like a homework assignment having to read subtitles all the way through. But of course this is a necessary part of the disguise. The movie has little plot, and needs little. Mostly it's a kind of sports spectacular featuring a series of bloody ordeals: a hunt, a battle, a march, a ceremony with human sacrifices, a game where the players end up dead, a chase, assorted revenge killings, and finally a providential escape (for the moment, but with a foretaste of all-encompassing destruction to follow). I suspect some of the details are historically doubtful; just by looking up the Maya in an encyclopedia, I find that the ending is impossible by a few centuries; the Maya are shown as practically Neandertal, yet as having a society of some complexity; and so on. Of course I could ascertain the facts by doing some reading; but what 14-year-old would want to do that? Mel Gibson, who began his career as a fair to middling director, has improved with each movie and here displays terrific flair and inventiveness in creating an original, involving, unified but ever-varying work of popular art, halfway between a tapestry and a comic strip. I believe no other contemporary director could have done what he has here. However, I submit he's now at a point where he's ready to move on to some subject that doesn't involve eternal bashing, beating and belaboring. In his own private life he has so often incurred belaborings for various incorrectnesses in his films, one sees that he has the courage (or tactlessness), as well as the skill, to express his own point of view. It is only a question, therefore, whether he has, &c. One hopes to see the proof of it on screen, one of these centuries.",Apocalypto
170,son_of_cheese_messiah,Stunning and absorbing,9,20 April 2011,"The first half of this film, in which a local tribe is rounded up by a cruel empire, is among the best things I've seen in a long time. It is a tribute to the director that the subtitles, something which I normally find annoying, pass almost unnoticed and the viewer is swept along by the stunning succession of imagery even as he is appalled by the brutality. I did not find this brutality gratuitous. The tribe is led, bound, across a beautiful but deadly landscape to an unknown destination. This is compellingly handled, although the appearance of the prophet girl (or the continued shots of the wife and son down the well) is perhaps a forewarning of conventionality to come. The arrival at the capital, with its mixture of a fair-like atmosphere and ritual sacrifice is equally convincing and visually stunning. Had the second half of this continued as the first, I would have no doubt this film would be a masterpiece. However, at the appearance of the eclipse, the film mutates into something more routine and ""Hollywoodian"". The prolonged chase through the forest, although implausible, is well done in its own way, but it is something we have all seen before: a virtually superhuman hero being pursued by hardly less superhuman chasers. Everything then proceeds to a rather predictable climax, a shame after the amazing first half.",Apocalypto
171,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: The Art of Violence,8,14 September 2013,"I respect director Mel Gibson way more than the actor Mel Gibson. He is different from the crowd. In Apocalypto, he uses a simple tale of human fighting spirit and sets the background in small tribe of dark forests. What sets the movie apart is the artistic way the most violent and gruesome scenes are filmed. Here the graphic nature of violent scenes is not repelling rather it intensifies the dangerous atmosphere of forest and its stone age civilizations. From start to finish there are sweeping visuals, haunting back-ground score, highly detailed scenes and some very good acting. The pacing is slow so that you can absorb every detail with patience. The chilling climax is like icing on the cake. This is one of those rare movies where violence is inspiring rather disturbing. Highly recommended for great movies' seekers.",Apocalypto
172,seawalker,Good film,7,7 May 2007,"I come to praise Mel Gibson, not to bury him. In recent times he may have turned out to be a bit of a nobber, but he has put together a good film in ""Apocalypto"".Yes, ""Apocalypto"" is extremely violent and bloodthirsty, and has pretensions towards art by shooting all of the dialogue in authentic Maya, when really shooting the dialogue in English wouldn't have made a lot of difference to the reality of the film, but it is also a beautifully constructed and exhilarating action film. The film is visceral, fast and even funny. The whole chase sequence during the second half of the film is fantastic, with our hero using only his wits and cunning to take out the villains. And what villains... (Boo, hiss.) Perhaps ""Apocalypto"" is a little bit long, and (vague spoilers ahead) the whole wife-in-peril and the arrival of the future at the end is a bit conveniently plotty, but on balance it is not a bad film to start the year with.You'll like it. Forget that Gibson's an idiot. Go to see ""Apocalypto"" and enjoy, but beware, it is violent.",Apocalypto
173,Rathko,Aesthetics over Storytelling,6,14 December 2006,"'Apocolypto' is a disappointing experience. The vast majority of the film is little more than people running for their lives through dense jungle. The narrative is incredibly simple and linear, with no real plot turns or meaningful developments. There's little suspense or real tension, despite the non-stop action of the second half. As in 'Passion of the Christ', the antagonists are painted in broad strokes of caricatured leering, cackling evil. The Nazis that Indiana Jones fought had more subtlety and depth than the average Gibson villain. The much talked about violence is really not that bad. It's certainly nowhere near the excruciating levels of 'Passion' or even some of the more recent 'hard-R' horror movies. I can only imagine that the critics have never seen an R-rated movie before.On the plus side, the very brief depiction of the Mayan city looks spectacular and paints a rich urban society of politics, fashion, and religion that is tragically never explored. I was far more interested to know about the lives of the royal family, the priests and acolytes, the middle class and the peasantry, the mineworkers and the diseased, than in those of the enslaved tribespeople. Production design, costume design and make-up are all top notch and make you wonder why Hollywood has never made an attempt to depict such a well-known and visually impressive society before.Whenever you have a privileged white westerner making a film about another culture there will always be the feint whiff of racism. If the portrayal is positive, he is accused of liberal cowardice. If the portrayal is negative, he's accused of deeply ingrained xenophobia. Either way, the viewer can't avoid associations with cultural imperialism and is forced to consider whether this story is really ours to be telling. The problem is that such concerns are only ever raised when the culture being exploited for our entertainment has cultural relevance for 21st century American minorities. We ask questions of Zwick's vision of West Africa in 'Blood Diamond', but are happy to accept Scott's vision of ancient Rome in 'Gladiator'. It's okay for Gibson to create cultural caricatures and saintly martyrs out of the Scots in 'Braveheart', but when he deals with the Mayan culture of Central America, he's criticized. The only difference, of course, is that the Scots are not a politically charged minority in contemporary America and Latinos are. 'Apocolypto's closing images of Spanish ships and arriving Conquistadors, complete with Jesuit missionary, can be read one of two ways. Either they are intended to remind the audience that however savage the Maya could be, they had nothing on the Europeans to follow. Or else, we are invited to see the Europeans as the saviors of these barbaric and heathen savages. I'd like to think that Gibson intended the former reading, but in light of the controversy surrounding him, cannot be so sure that he does not intend the latter.A visually stunning movie that, like so many 'cultural epics', favors aesthetics over solid storytelling, and suffers for it.",Apocalypto
174,stimpy_tr,The problem with Apocalypto,7,3 October 2020,"The film supposedly represents the lives of natives of Maya civilization. However, the problem is that they were depicted to be too savage and barbarians. I don't quite agree with that. A civilization that lasted more than 1000 years cannot survive merely by way of scavanging and looting. This is the viewpoint of the white man on natives of American continent.Another issue is a technical one. That they speak a native language is a positive aspect, however everyone is syllabicating their own language. Otherwise, the film is worth watching once although not perfect.",Apocalypto

178,imbluzclooby,"Typical and Over the Top, Mel Gibson fanfare!",8,17 December 2006,"I have absolutely nothing against Mel Gibson personally. I will take this film for what it is and what it's not. My praises go toward his obviously zealous fascination with barbarism and nail-biting suspense. He accomplishes what exciting movie making is all about which is to entertain, excite and make us laugh and cringe. Stunning scenery,lavish costumes, makeup and sets are all part of the milieu which comprise a big budget film. However, my complaint is that Mel is attempting to expound his pseudo-intellectual ideas of history by depicting a civilization that has long been dead. For this attempt, Mel falls flat on his face. I have read too many comments and reviews that give this film any credibility to being historically accurate. No, the Conquistadors never saw Mayans since they had been dissolved for centuries by the time Spanish explorers ventured through the Andes. The Europeans didn't disembark from their ships until around 1500 A.D. anyway. No, there is no historical evidence of all the excessive tattooing, piercings, and symbolic scars of such tribes in Mexico. Gibson obviously took artistic license with all of the ornate body art. What we have here is style over substance. Forget that this movie is enthralling from an action standpoint. Look at its content. We have a setting where primitive people could have been like. They engage in barbaric hunting, personal joking at the expense of one of their tribesmen and his impotence. Funny, Ha Ha. Gibson wants to add some crude Hollywood humor. That's all fine. Then their village is pillaged by hostile attackers. There is fighting and bloodshed on both sides. The survivors are then hog-tied and taken away. Here is your typical Mel Gibson premise and the plight of ""Good Versus Evil"" as we have seen in all of his other films like Braveheart, The Patriot, The Passion, etc. etc. This is basically just a story of a man who has been wronged, Jaguar Paw, well played by the chiseled and gorgeous Rudy Youngblood. His family is endangered. He's taken prisoner along with his clan and along the arduous trek they get pummelled, tortured and humiliated. Jaguar Paw eventually escapes, fulfills a prophecy told by a native girl, dashes through the jungle in a cat and mouse chase against time from the villains, seeks revenge and proves his fearlessness and manhood to the world. This is so typical of Mel Gibson that it painfully mirrors all of his other work. His obsession with violence and masculinity seem to be overly eminent to the point of deterring our interest in a society that could have been portrayed in a more interesting light. Instead Gibson pitches to the lowest common denominator by turning this into a fictitious romp of Rambo during the Maya era, with hints of Braveheart bravado and spewing every possible violently graphic image to the point of absurdity. I will only merit this film on its aesthetic qualities. It's pretty to watch and exciting at times. Rudy Youngblood is refreshing eye candy. He negates the stereotypical Hollywood hunk with his dark and ethnic beauty. The acting is also very good. But this is just a movie. Don't expect to get the real story on the Mayans or Aztecs. Go see this if you want to see swashbuckling adventure and copious bloodshed.",Apocalypto
179,spencergrande6,"Intense and Febrile, Nothing Quite Like It",8,4 January 2017,"Mel Gibson can direct some real intensity, even through ham-handed moments that would derail lesser films. This film is intense and febrile, using the Gibson-classic near Martyrdom of a main character's suffering to build to an enlightenment. It works, even when his wife is giving birth in a rapidly filling well and he's being saved by a little kid's prophecies and sudden eclipses in the sky (I thought the Mayans could predict these with precision?) that is admittedly awe-inspiring.There's no need to reiterate in too much detail (it's been done to death) how impressive this film was to make. Shot on location, using the Maya language with a bunch of local, non-professional actors, elaborately re-created sets and mostly stunning camera work.Though I will say some of the digital hand-held photography hasn't held up, like most digital from that time, and looks ""digitized"" and lacking in detail and clarity. Some shots are still amazing (I think some of this was shot on film and I read briefly about some crane they used for overhead shots) but others are bafflingly video-like. It creates a disconnect at times.",Apocalypto
180,LaxFan94,Too gory for an historical account..,7,4 September 2007,"I liked this film because of how accurately the Mayans were portrayed and everything. However there were 2 main problems with it. Firstly, this was way too gory and overemphasized too much on their sacrificial practices rather than focusing more on their everyday life. I think that Mr. Gibson thought that audiences would have wanted to see more blood and guts than anything else. Now although the Mayan sacrificial practices were a normal occurrence, there was way too much focus on that.The other problem with this one was that Mr. Gibson and all the other directors and producers chose to have the Mayans fight amongst each other! I think it would have been a whole lot better if the film had the first Spanish conquistadors meet the Mayans for the first time. Now THAT would have been a lot more interesting scenario because the wars that the Mayans and Spaniards had were a lot more intense. The Mayans hated the Spaniards a lot more than they hated each other... trust me on that one.When the Spanish first came onto Mayan soil, they immediately thought that they were gods who their Priests predicted they would appear. The Elders were right when they foresaw the Spaniards' arrival, but what they didn't know was that they were human just anyone else. As a result of this misunderstanding, the Mayans became too overwhelmed by the Spaniards ability to overpower them in all aspects. The Mayans didn't find out that they were just humans until it was too late. By that time, every Mayan temple and city were burned to the ground. :( But.... ANYWAY.... that's a different topic altogether. I chose the vote of 7 for this film for the above reasons.",Apocalypto
181,oshram-3,Visually stunning treat,8,19 December 2006,"Apocalypto follows the story of a young hunter named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his travails as his village is invaded by an Aztec raiding party. He and his mates are captured and taken to the Aztec capital, where the real battle to stay alive begins. There's actually not that much plot  Gibson takes his time establishing the world setting and letting us get to know Jaguar Paw and his family. As soon as that's comfortably accomplished, bam, here come the Aztecs, accurately, as history informs us, portrayed as a pretty rough bunch of guys (the casting of the leader of the war-band is just tremendous; the actor just exudes arrogance, experience, and power). We linger for a while on the road to the Aztec capital, a lengthy and unpleasant experience for Jaguar Paw and his pals, but all this slow pacing pays off terrifically when we reach the city. Up until now, it's been all rivers and jungle, but when you step into the Aztec city it's a whole different world, and brilliantly, little of it is explained. Given that the Aztecs had very different aesthetic ideals than we do, a lot of Aztec culture just comes off as weird and lurid. It should  that's the whole point here, and the fact that none of it is explained makes it even more terrifying.The performances are all strong throughout the film. It hits all the right notes  we find it very easy to like Jaguar Paw, and his nemesis, Zero Wolf, is a cocky, arrogant jerk; you're pleased and relieved when their showdown comes. For the most part, though, Apocalypto is interested less in straightforward drama than it is in submersing you in another world, one we don't often see, and there it succeeds marvelously. It should be noted that that world is cruel, violent, and bloody, but then the world of the Aztecs was all those things. There are a few nitpicky details that sort of get washed over  how can Jaguar Paw return so quickly to his village when it took so long to get to the capital on the way in?  but these are minor concerns overall, and easily overlooked amidst all the spectacle. Apocalypto probably isn't for everyone  it gets a little rough in spots  but it is a visual treat, and the story satisfies well enough. If you have any interest you'd probably better go while it's on the big screen, as this would lose something on the smaller home screen.",Apocalypto

Anyone leaving a bad review about accuracy is just trying to feel smart by actually comparing a piece of cinematic art to a real Mayan tribe.

183,skymovies,"Eat your heart out, Rambo",9,7 January 2007,"Everyone's favourite booze-soaked anti-Semite is back with a cracking combination of First Blood, Braveheart and National Geographic. Like him or not, there's no denying that Mel Gibson knows how to put a movie together.First he fought until he was blue in the face as William Wallace, the Scottish hero who stuck it to the evil English in Braveheart. Then he had the son of God suffering for all our sins at the hands of Jews and Romans alike in Passion Of The Christ. Dusting off the tried-and-trusted template once again, Gibbo now throws another underdog into a world of massacred family members, violent persecution and strange tongues.Looking like international soccer ace Ronaldinho, jungle tribesman Jaguar Paw shows similarly singular skills to squirrel away his pregnant wife and child before eluding sacrifice and dodging his sadistic Mayan captors.It's a spectacularly grisly adventure through which Paw must survive relentless torrents of blood, mud, dust and rain with nothing more than instinct and determination.Thought has gone into this. Gibson takes pains to give clear personalities to what could have been disposable cyphers and allows audiences the odd breather from the savage grandeur with pleasing smaller moments.The fear and confusion of the captives is effectively conveyed in marvellously staged crowd scenes, POV shots of Paw's flight cleverly mirror the earlier hunting of a tapir, and there is a beautiful overhead shot of the chase through a cornfield.Having created a world where actions speak louder than words, it would be nice to see Mel taking a leaf out of his own book.",Apocalypto
184,craig-hopton,An historical thriller with lots (and lots) of gore,7,19 March 2013,"This movie is relentless. It just doesn't stop. The drama, and most of all the gore, just keeps on coming. The two hours fly by.I guess the intention with all the blood and guts was to not shy away from the brutal realities of the Mayan civilisation, but it becomes rather gratuitous and desensitising. By the time people were having their hearts cut out I barely flinched. It's a major fault and actually a bit a shame, because otherwise this is an excellent movie.The central idea - that Mayan civilisation is brutal but watch out because worse (the conquistadors) is coming - is well made. There's an epic quality to the scenes in the Mayan city that is the equal of the great epic movies of old. The use of unknown, authentic actors and the Mayan language was a brave but inspired decision and also works brilliantly.It's thrilling to watch and overall, this movie is undoubtedly a success. But a little more subtlety would go a long way.",Apocalypto
185,nturner,Enthralling Character Study,10,8 November 2008,"I didn't think I was going to like Apocalypto but instead of finding a film filled with senseless blood and gore, I found it to be an enthralling character study of an intelligent and courageous young man with a single thought and quest - to reunite with and save the lives of his family.Mel Gibson gets a lot of bad press, and he does appear to be somewhat of a kook who seems to be getting worse and worse as the years progress, but he certainly is good at creating films that appeal to one's heartstrings and sense of right and wrong. Just think - either through his acting talent, his directing talent, or both - he has given us Tim, Gallipoli, The Year of Living Dangerously, The Bounty, The River, Hamlet, The Man Without a Face, Braveheart, Ransom, The Patriot, We Were Soldiers, The Passion of the Christ, and now Apocalypto.Keep in mind that Apocalypto is a work of fiction - highly implausible and fanciful fiction at that. As far as I know, it never professed to be a documentary about the lives of Central American natives. It is a character driven action film, and a very good one at that. Yes there is blood and gore but no more than is seen in any action film now-a-days. Obviously, this film is not everyone's cup of tea, but for me, it was two hours and twenty minutes of solid, edge-of-seat ""mindless"" entertainment.In the film, Jaguar Paw is the son of a respected village elder whom we assume is destined to, someday, be the leader of the village. He enjoys hunting and joking with the other young men of the village and is singularly devoted to his wife and son and is blessed with another child on the way. The lives of the entire village are torn asunder when they are attacked by a warrior tribe. Many are murdered outright and the rest are taken captive. During the fray, Jaguar Paw is able to hide his wife and child from the invaders. They are forced to march to a jungle city where the women are sold as slaves and the men are to be sacrificed to the gods in order to end a period of disease and drought. Through a series of totally improbable events, Jaguar Paw is able to escape and sets out to return to his village and save his wife and child. He is pursued by the fiercest warriors of the tribe whom he outsmarts and kills in various skillful ways. It's sort of like Die Hard in the jungle. How he finally escapes the last of his pursuers is so absurd that it is just plain out laughable, but so what - this is a fictional action flick created for pure gut-level enjoyment.Rudy Youngblood plays Jaguar Paw, and he is an incredible young actor. I predict that we haven't seen the last of him. He has a great face and uses it expertly in this film to convey a full range of emotions. Because the dialog in the film is totally Mayan, spoken lines are kept to a minimum. Youngblood heads up a film full of actors entertaining us with facial expressions and actions rather than through a preponderance of dialog. Add extraordinary scenery, elaborate sets, and an unbelievable number of different costumes and you have a film that gives you some good, solid entertainment.",Apocalypto
186,billion_mucks,Inside the Aztec Jungle,9,5 November 2007,"Mel Gibson third attempt on directing, brings us a fantastic piece of art. ""Apocalpyto"" greatest feature is to present the Aztec society in a very realistic way and introducing them as human beings and individuals that move for needs and not as a historical society, but as a group of people that laugh, cry, fight for their families. ""Apocalpyto"" gets off the books. In its dire passion, Gibson makes it all to the top: amateur actors with Indian blood that talk ancient, dead languages, marvelous settings that are the result of extensive works and a great art direction, not missing any single detail and reviving a succulent and visually stunning empire. For moments, it appears like we are watching a documentary, its such the effect of the film. But the greatest characteristic of the movie is the jungle: so vast and powerful, we can almost smell it, or feel the thorned trees that make the natural settings. The atmosphere is simply outstanding, making the movie a visual Colosseum. The raw nature of this film make it so artistic and direct, I recommend you not to miss it if you do appreciate cinema at its best expression, or If you are studying cinema so much better.

188,cofemug,Snuff: The Sequel,3,22 February 2007,"Apocalypto (2006) dir: Mel Gibson Two Hours and Twenty Minutes of what could have been exquisitely filmed chasing and torture murdered by a director who wants to be the next Oliver Stone and mixing media like it was cake, and adding in clichés like they were nothing.Apocalypto is Mel Gibson's homage to the action genre, and human torture. That is humans torturing other humans, killing animals, insects, etc etc. And its all supposed to be oh so tribal. Yet, as many of us realize long before the first frame, this was written by a White European descendant.Mel glibly opens the film with the quote, ""'A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.' - Ariel Durant"" which notifies us that something is about to happen. Then, we merrily watch the all too European happiness of the supposedly native Mexican tribal culture. Only to have them be taken as captives by the Mayans as part of the eclipse ritual.But, some stupid 10 year old girl who has ""The Sickness"" has an apocalyptic warning about jaguars, eclipses, and Colonel Kurtz. So, then we get to watch beheadings for the purpose of ritual, until the eclipse is over after which the rest of the captives are killed for sport. Except for one, Jaguar Paw, who gets chased through the forest.Did I mention that Jaguar Paw also left his almost-due wife and first-born son down a pit during the attack. This sets up the ticking clock for the third act when it downpours hard enough to fill the pit to make them drown. And the wife also induces labor on herself because she was trying to get out. Also, don't pregnant women know how to float? And shouldn't children learn how to float or swim if they know how to talk? Seriously...this is not new-fangled information.But, seriously, how dumb are these natives? No climbing rocks while pregnant. You just got a dead animal to eat, you can survive for a bit longer in the pit. Or, duck if a spear is chucked straight at you. Or dodge. Something. Don't be dumb.So, besides all this are the stupid call outs to other FAMOUS movies from before. The Fugitive's waterfall dive is merely one example of how exasperated I became with this movie.To me, the biggest tragedy is Gibson's use of HDDV stock. He mixed in DV with some 35mm and some 16mm. And, it was extremely distracting. I HATE DV on the big screen. HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT. I can tell the digital artifacts within two frames. I wanted the lush colors of The Thin Red Line. I wanted the gorgeous shots of 2001. I wanted something visual. Not washed out greens and whites. BOOOO.The movie has the finale of bringing in the Europeans. Hence, his glib opening comment and stating that we were going to conquer this group anyways because they destroyed themselves. They were weak, we were superior. We justifiably won by destroying a rotten civilization. Such a moral person, that Mr. Gibson is, isn't he? But, the movie does move along. And, even though you don't care after the first act is over (or at least I didn't), there are still some points of interest along the way making it momentarily fun and it keeps the movie rolling along.C-",Apocalypto
189,teh_mode,"It may be the end of civilisation as we know it, but boy is it thrilling!",8,15 January 2007,"In Apocalypto, it may be the end of civilisation, as we knew it. But at least Mel Gibson is still alive and kicking. Whatever one might make of Mighty Mel's recent ""sugartits"" mishap, there is no doubt in my mind that he is rapidly becoming one of Hollywood's most important directors. From the torturous nature, both on the characters and the audience, in his last film The Passion Of The Christ (2003) comes an even more sadistic, albeit rapidly more enjoyable, tale of animal slicing, spear piercing, testicle eating and throat cutting. And that's just the first 20 minutes. Has the former lethal weapon lost his mind? And if so, is that really a bad thing? The opening of Apocalypto gives you a pretty solid idea of the tone most of the film will operate at  an incredibly shaky camera is following a galloping wild bore through the Mesoamerican jungles when, all of a sudden, a band of wandering nomads trap the poor beast and eat its insides raw, whilst cracking jokes about testicle eating. It is interesting just how many Americanisms Mel manages to fit into this picture. At one point he even squeezes a Midnight Cowboy reference into the dialogue at which everyone in my screening simultaneously laughed. But then  of course they would joke around, it is probably an ignorant western perception that wandering nomads or remote villagers would have been slightly immature when they wanted to be, or even had mother-in-law issues. The story centres on a young hunter named Jaguar Paw (Youngblood). Already caring for one child, his wife is expecting another any day soon. Unfortunately for him, his peaceful settlement is to be ravaged by a hoard of murderous slave traders from the city. Placing his wife and son in confinement, Jaguar Paw is then captured and taken with the few other survivors to be sacrificed by the cities bloodthirsty leaders. By a twist of fate (and a couple of Deus Ex devices) Jaguar Paw manages to evade his ultimate destiny to rescue his wife and child before it's too late. As he sprints off into the jungle, his captures, lead by the skull-clad Zero Wolf (Trujillo). For the next two thirds of the film  Apocalypto becomes pure chase movie, with everything from killer bees, to waterfall jumps coming between our hero.Historical inaccuracy taints almost every Hollywood production these days, but I am willing to give a film a pass if the poetic license really adds a positive to the proceedings. After reading some historians complain about what the film contains, it is really only a few nitty-gritty details that get in the way of the overall authenticity that Gibson has tried to instill in his film, such as Mayans not using daggers, or them having an understanding of astrology. Few should be bothered by this, as for the most part, Apocalypto exists as pure thrill-seeking entertainment. It is gory in the extreme, and 20 years ago would almost definitely have been banned under the video nasties act. But one of the great triumphs of Gibson's film is that you really feel the violence. When characters get speared, you get speared too. When a jaguar shreds a hunter's head to a gory bump in the jungle pathway, it caused a whole host of cinema-goers to simultaneously cover their eyes in trembling repulsion. Gibson does not relent with the violence - he wants you to suffer like the victims of the film.Where the movie exists more as a tale of Mayan destruction, however, is where the film fails to provide proper answers for its audience. At one point we see a young girl, suffering from smallpox, attempt to approach the passing slaves and headhunters before being repeatedly pushed back by one of them with a stick. We know that diseases such as smallpox contributed to the decline of almost every major civilisation both in North and South America, but this was a disease carried over by the west. In Apocalypto, the conquistadors don't come-a-knocking until the film has reached its twilight. Furthermore  once the chase begins, the question of how this civilisation ceased to be becomes obtuse. We get glimpses of disease, colonisation, inner-fighting and weakening crops, but at heart this becomes an old fashion action chase, brilliantly melding the brutal and beautiful. Perhaps there is another story to b told about the colonialist effects on this civilisation, but when movies are as violently exhilarating as Apocalypto, you can forgive its shortcomings.",Apocalypto
190,pritol,Absorbing and immersive experience,8,14 August 2020,"It's taken me years to get round to seeing this, and in no way was I disappointed. Whilst there is some poetic license in talking about the collapse of Mayan civilisation, but setting it in a time period when the Inca were around, and showing some Aztec behaviours during some of the key sacrifice scenes are involved, it in no way detracts from the film.What I quite liked about it, was rather than take a viewpoint from the centre of Mayan civilisation it takes it from the viewpoint of a Mayan family who live in a quiet jungle village.It's a film of two halves, with the first setting the scene around Mayan life, and focusing a fair bit on how brutal life was back then. The second is a much more thrilling lead up to the end when the main character is trying to save his family and himself.It might not get all the details right, but this is a wonderfully immersive experience, well worth the ride.",Apocalypto
191,scobbah,Mel and his staff have done a good job here,7,9 June 2007,"First, I must admit that I have yet not seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of The Christ, hence I cannot point out any similarities or differences between that one and Apocalypto. Indeed I was expecting a bit of gore due to several other comments I have read, but I cannot really say there was too much of it. Yes, there was a heavy dose of violence but since it was depicted in a very artistic style the violence never really felt exaggerated like it would earn the flick comments such as 'too much gore'.As for the flick itself, executing it in Mayan language contributed a lot to the overall feeling of authenticity (even though one ought to question whether the flick really gives a fair view of the Mayan culture). The actors did a great job on their part, no question about that. I rarely find myself connecting with the hero or heroine in Hollywood flicks these days as they tend to be so exaggerated and cliché that I quickly lose interest in them. Mel and his staff have done a good job here though, having Rudy Youngblood playing Jaguar Paw was a very good decision indeed.To put it short as regards the scenery, it was simply amazing.7/10 - well worth a view",Apocalypto
192,macpet49-1,Extinction Has a Purpose,4,27 March 2009,"Mel, Mel, Mel, what were you thinking? Nice camera work. The rest is like a bad dream. What a horrid little culture the Mayan culture was. Thank god they're gone! Mel seems to have a need to show us the worst parts of humanity in all it's pain and gory. But then again, Mel's a bit of a psycho. He's one nervous dude (Ever see him on a talk show sit still for a mere second?)and that mind of his as close to paranoia as I ever wish to get. I think he was propositioned by an older man as a child and never got over it. So many closets in his life.

This movie has more gore, mutilations and torture than most horror flicks. If you thought Savning Private Ryan was too intense, get ready to see something more extreme. Too bad because sometimes it distracts you from the plot and the action, which is quite good. Mel is very talented enhancing the drama of every scene. Something I remember well from Braveheart. The story itself is very simple, but it works quite well. Despite the mindless violence, is still one of the best movies of 2006.",Apocalypto

Why does he insist on showing so much of the same sadistic violence over and over again in his films? The violence here is relentless, and for the most part it's pointless and gratuitous. He is obsessed with using the film medium to spread a violent, demented ideology, and as much credit as I can give to the films design and young actors, I just can't get over the giant dark stain that is Mel Gibson. His extreme religious views and public stupidity just overshadow (for me) what is otherwise a totally decent film.. Forgive me, but I feel like Alex in A Clockwork Orange when I pay ten dollars to see a film which presents me with so much ultraviolence and I am then forced to choose between sitting there to make my ten dollars feel well spent, or walk out in disgust. Total crock, thanks Mel. Next time I'll just shoot myself in the face.",Apocalypto
195,samseescinema,A personification of Mel Gibson in movie form...which isn't so bad,8,1 December 2006,"Apocalypto reviewed by Sam OsbornI've never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Mel Gibson. But if I had, I think I'd see Apocalypto as a filmic manifestation of himself: passionate, intense, and just a little absurd. You can tell how Gibson approaches his films, Apocalypto in particular. He charges at them like a ticked-off Toro in the bullfighter's ring. He immerses himself completely in the story's culture, going to painstaking lengths to bury us in details even when the story's as shallow as a Honduran puddle in the dry season. But I admire a filmmaker like him. There's a kind of purity in his style that insists upon long, epic, immersive pictures. Not to mention they're more violent than Mad Max on amphetamines. Like the upcoming Children of Men, Apocalypto drops us by the collar into a civilization not our own and doesn't bother with exposition. But since the men are thongs and the women are topless, it doesn't take long for us to figure out we're in the midst of Mayan rule. Our hero is Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a wily young man whose father has shown him the ways of the forest and the skills of the hunter. His wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and their son, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez), live humbly in the village with all the rest, working and listening to the prophetic tales of the elders. This fine, happy life collapses though, as the Mayan kingdom begins ravaging its own villages for sacrifice to the gods. Take my explanation with a grain of salt however, because none of this clearly explained in the film; it's just what we manage to extrapolate from the man painted in orange lopping off heads. Anyway, while Jaguar Paw's village is being razed, he manages to lower his wife and son into a deep, unexplained hole, hiding them from the massacre. And even as he's being strung to the rest of the village's survivors and led to the acropolis for sacrifice, Jaguar Paw must plan his escape so he can rescue his family from certain death at the hands of a rainstorm. Like his other films, Apocalypto is a simple contraption. Its surrounding details, as thick as they might be, still betray the simplicity of its story. And at its heart, Apocalypto is little more than a rowdy chase film. A good 90 minutes of it finds Jaguar Paw sprinting barefoot through the forest with a band of hunters closing in behind him. And so it's not hard to understand Touchstone's original July release slating for the film, as it probably will appeal to young men as much as to the Academy. But as Braveheart and Passion of the Christ have proved, simplicity isn't a problem for Mr. Gibson. Either is violence, apparently. Braveheart shocked us early on with a swift beheading, and Jesus took lashings so brutal that Roger Ebert named Passion of the Christ the most violent film he had ever seen. So for Apocalypto, which pulls focus on one of the most vicious civilizations in history, violence is an obvious requisite. But, as usual with Gibson's work, the indulgence with violence brims upon excessive. It's not that I believe Mr. Gibson to be a sadist; but rather I think he has no other way as a director to channel his audience's emotions. It seems to be a weakness of his; one that puts characters second fiddle to blood and guts. Granted, in Apocalypto, a certain level of brutality is absolutely required for us to believe in Gibson's Mayan world. But there are times when the film just revels in the bloodshed.If nothing else though, Apocalypto is earnest. From the visualsby Dancing with Wolves veteran Dean Semlerto the decision to use a nearly dead language, and to the casting of all no-name natives, Gibson has lunged at this picture with all his might. And for the most part, it works. But somewhere along the 150 minute freight train of a picture, we may have picked up a few splinters.Samuel Osborn",Apocalypto
196,JamesRutland,see the only first 30 minutes,1,20 January 2009,"the first 30 minutes of the movie are natural, fine and human one... after the escape the movie becomes ridiculous with a succession of incredible strange over-human circumstances which end with the appearance of the European landing saving the hero from sure destiny of death... 1) the hero runs with a deep wound by arrow for almost 2 days; 2) the hero is faster than a panther; 3) the enemies die killed by animals appearing as ghosts; 4) the hero suddenly discovers to be a Rambo in his jungle; 5) the hero becomes invulnerable. One of the worst movie I ever seen, so incredible stupid despite of the beautiful natural places. The only good thing is the actors performance. I hope for negative vote... -2. It could be an awesome movie but custom must be amazed above all reality. There is not a story but only emotional sensations. The movie ends after 30 minutes.",Apocalypto
197,eastbergholt2002,Enjoyable!,9,1 July 2007,"Apocalypto is an exciting chase movie with plenty of blood and gore. The film is set in the days before the Spanish replace the Maya as rulers of Central America. The actors speak in Yucatec Mayan, with English subtitles. Most big budget action movies focus on visuals and don't have a lot of dialog. So the absence of conversation doesn't create a major problem.Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a loving husband and father who lives a simple, idyllic life in the forest with his tribe. They have lived as hunter-gatherers for generations until the Maya arrive looking for candidates for human sacrifice. Jaguar Paw is alerted by a barking dog and manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son in an underground cave. He then tries to help the other villagers before they are over-powered and taken to a Mayan city. Mel prefers his bad guys to be evil and sadistic, so the Maya are portrayed as decadent and superstitious with no respect for human life. Their religion and behavior seem insane and the villagers and their way of life are depicted as unfortunate victims. After reaching the Maya city, Jaguar Paw manages to escape and is chased back to his village. He somehow manages to pick off his pursuers one-by-one. The film looks beautiful and the unknown cast are totally convincing. The movie introduces you to a strange and fascinating world and keeps you engrossed. Mel likes to make movies which portray empires as wicked and immoral. Usually he's accusing Rome or Britain. But for Americans it's probably safer to view the film as an action movie rather than look for metaphors. Mel's direction is faultless and the film is very entertaining.",Apocalypto

199,fearfulofspiders,Just Too Improbable at Times...,6,3 September 2008,"Okay, Jaguar Paw could really teach Morpheus and Neo how to dodge and fight. This guy manages to escape the paths of so many arrows and spears, it's a wonder Gibson didn't go back and rework some of this before post. When he is hit, he walks away fine and dandy -- sure, with a limp -- but the endurance in this ""protagonist"" would rival some of the Olympians today.The writing is okay, yet this is just one ugly film in terms of nudity and gore. There's one Mayan savage that says the F-bomb, which caught me off guard and made me question the integrity of the picture. While the writing may be accurate to the time period and the Mayans themselves, it actually made me happy we wiped them out with smallpox. These guys are portrayed as brutal beings with no sense of respect or social order unless it is to please their gods. Honestly, I salute the illnesses of the 1500s for managing to end any more of their hateful worshiping.There is too much gore in this film. It was so predictable whenever someone was about to be sacrificed or hit with a dart. Once again, the Jaguar Paw proves that this film is too improbable at times, as he manages to escape with his life just as an Eclipse so happens to pass by.The music by James Horner sounds very similar to his earlier work, but at times can be pretty good.Overall, this film is just too over-the-top. From the sheer luck the main character has, to the predictable end. Only worth a viewing if you're a fan of Gibson or are not easily angered at the actions portrayed by the Mayans.",Apocalypto
200,MovieZoo,Apocalypto - my faith in good movies lives,8,8 December 2006,"Apocalypto is strangely satisfying. All the blood and guts, or other body parts, I expected to see was almost as I expected. It was definitely not a slasher movie style, but was a true representation of a life style that actually existed. While the brutality is something I am sure existed, I could only guess the societal commentary was somewhat accurate. It is hard to say deaths were tasteful, but again, we are watching an interpretation of history according to an excellent movie maker. I do believe Mel tried to be accurate and he definitely used his literary license to add some ""Mel"" moments in dialogue and action to great effect.The movie starts by introducing one tribe that learned about life in its own way while another lived a little differently. The first two tribes are separated by their survival skills in that one lives by hunting, while the other, survives by fishing. The simplistic life seems to show us the happy side of life. When the two discover each other, they are slightly cautious, but see they are not much different from each other as they share a love of life and family. While these two have found similarities, the second has experienced something the other is not familiar with - a third tribe with a taste of blood, power and exploitation. Of course, the three tribes soon have a meeting of anything but minds.When the lives of the first two tribes are shattered by an already self-destructive tribe, we get more blood and hatred than any civilization should spend. The third tribe shows the other two how powerful and enlightened they are by depriving the strangers of life and blood in front of those who want to believe their civilization is graced by the gods - the same gods created by cruel, self absorbed men and women.All blood aside, this was a spellbinding movie that traps your attention and imagination feeding the audience with emotion, sympathy and awe.I loved it, but again, bloody movies automatically lose a point with me and another point is lost because I was not too crazy for the last minute, although the overall ending was quite fitting. 8 of 10 from me.",Apocalypto

The performances are good, the plot is interesting and entertaining, the chase and fight sequences are great, the shots are beautiful and one of the final scenes in the beach is very good.

203,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,Awful Historical Film,5,4 August 2019,"Okay...Mel Gibson's ""historical"" epic film ""Apocalypto"" is not a good movie. The movie is incredibly inaccurate to history, to the point that it's fiction, and the point that it is completely clear that writers of the film did not enough research into the film. Let me explain...Now, the idea for this film is actually a decent one. The story of the end of the Mayan Classic Era. It's an idea that hadn't been done before, and an interesting premise for a historical film. And I also find it refreshing that the film is in the Mayan language. However, the execution is most certainly not good.But (you may ask), what's my gripe. Well, the story of the film rarely follows what actually happened, and the writing in that department is so inconsistent that it boggles the mind beyond any possible measure. Okay, so in some areas it follows history, like when it shows how the Mayan leaders could predict the Solar Eclipses, and they used that to put themselves on par with the Gods in the minds of the average folk. But other times, the film gets things wrong. Such as, the Mayans apparent sacrifices, by taring out human hearts, which is not something they did. Those were the Aztecs (entirely different people). So that leaves me with one question - What historical period are they trying to adapt?And not only that, the ending is even dumber. Ending with the Spanish coming over to enslave them. Even though they were enslaved by the Spanish 100 years after the movie's supposed setting and time period. And it just doesn't make sense.Along with that, you have the average bad movie stuff, such as characters I don't care about. and while the film is indeed visually stunning, it doesn't make up for the narrative holes.Now, you may question if I like Gibson's other historical dramas. Well, the rest are a mixed bag for me. ""Braveheart"" was only okay; ""The Patriot"" was garbage; ""The Passion of the Christ"" was decent; and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was amazing. But I think this film is easily the worse of his historical films. It's a really missed opportunity. This movie could have been amazing, but sadly...it wasn't.",Apocalypto
204,DrTuvok,All the negative reviews say the same thing,10,23 August 2020,"I don't think a lot of the negative reviewers on this site even watched the movie because they all have the same criticisms parroted from the hypocritical critics. Here are the criticisms and a response to them:Mel Gibson is such a terrible person!What does that even have to do with the movie? It's still a good movie, and besides, it's not like any Hollywood directors are even good people anyway, a lot of them (*James Gunn*) are perverted. Compared to these types Mel Gibson isn't even that bad, and he is undeniably more talented than most.It's not an accurate depiction of the Mayans!How would anybody alive now even know exactly how the Mayans lived? Has anyone banging in stuff on a keyboard online now lived with them? I didn't think so. And if someone is such a Mayan expert, maybe they should try making a movie themselves. Or they should go to the History Channel instead of to the movies, because what movies really are 100% accurate? Apocalypto is exciting and immersive, two things which it probably would lose if it tried to be 'historically accurate'.Mel Gibson is trying to depict the Mayans as savages!I hate to break it to you, but if you actually believe that the Mayans lived in some kind of ethnic utopia with no brutality and no fear you are not only absurdly naive but you are also stupid. Humans are the same all over the world and have always been the same; and to deny the Mayans simple, primal concepts such as fear and violence would be to deny them their humanity. There has NEVER been any kind of widespread hippie utopia at ANY time or place in history, despite what the fans of Disney's Pocahontas try to tell you. Anyway. Maybe the Mayans were savages, but that doesn't mean that all the rest of us, even alive today, are not.",Apocalypto
205,stevetseitz,Jarring and otherworldly,10,26 December 2006,"With ""Braveheart"", ""The Passion of The Christ"" and ""Apocalypto"" Mel Gibson seems intent on focusing his artistic abilities by bringing us stories which center around the frailty of the human body and the fortitude of the human soul.After seeing ""Apocalypto"", I think I can understand a bit more about what makes Gibson tick as an auteur. He wants to wake the modern day audience up out of their spoon-fed stupor and re-introduce us to the world as it really is.Most modern day humans have no clue what it is to deal with nature and find our own food. In fact, if we can't get a toasty hot Krispy Kreme when and where we want it we get rather perturbed.In Apocalypto, we see first hand the effort and skill that goes into hunting and surviving in an unforgiving jungle. This is no idyllic Disney fantasy as in Pocahontas. This is a harsh unforgiving world where animals that can kill may be around the next tree and quicksand-like bogs might swallow you whole if you don't watch your step. And, as if this set of obstacles wasn't enough, Gibson introduces the antagonists in the form of warriors from a decaying totalitarian society. This makes an already tough existence almost unbearable.Our hero, Jaguar Paw, is a natural survivor and easy to like. He cares for his family and friends and provides for the tribe with his hunting and fierce combat skills. His ordeal is extreme and we watch through his eyes as his journey takes him from a natural state of balance, living in the jungle with his wife and child to a world where entire fields have become mass graves, where people toil without any connection to the natural world and where corrupt and power hungry leaders have taken what Jaguar Paw holds most dear,life, and made it worthless.This is a social commentary indeed, but it's not nearly the granola enviro-dweeb propaganda that some critics have made it out to be.Gibson's commentary here echoes his work in ""Braveheart"" and ""Passion"" by affirming the importance of free will and the essential goodness of man in a natural state.There may be an allegorical statement in the film regarding Gibson's father who has been villainized and attacked by the media for ,shall we say, ""controversial"" views and statements regarding the holocaust. Gibson has a particularly unsavory character execute Jaguar Paw's father right before his eyes. It is certainly possible that Gibson feels that a man he has great respect for has had his character assassinated right before his eyes.",Apocalypto
206,Cocacolaguy912-2,Fantastic...amazing.,10,19 December 2006,"Apocalypto...Mel Gibson. I will get straight to the point...no matter what you think about Mel Gibson, you can not deny he is a hell of a good filmmaker. Braveheart and now this. The man knows how to entertain.Apocalypto is certainly frightening...and definitely not for the weak minded, hearted...or stomach. It is gore galore, it is all out, and it is completely awesome. The acting - by a first timer - is comparable to that of actors who have been acting all their lives. The acting was wonderful.However, the thing that really just shined for me was the cinematography. It may be the best I have ever seen, and I am not even kidding. If this film does not win the Oscar for best cinematography I will be unhappy.Apocalypto may seem a little superhuman and over-the-top at times, but if you can just sort of ignore that small flaw and enjoy everything else about it, it is hands down one of, if not the best movie of 2006.Mel Gibson is certainly a very disturbed man...but, and I know many will disagree, I am willing to put behind his outbursts, accept his apology, and enjoy his stunning films.10/10.",Apocalypto

I don't want to say too much more: but if you like historical novels, historical romances, that kind of thing, you'll very probably like this movie.The script was clean and convincing; the cinematography was splendid and lush; the casting and acting were both superb. Rudy Youngblood, as Panther Paw, was exceptionally convincing; but really the acting was really, really fine from start to finish.My feelings during this movie combined an almost constant adrenaline rush along with a sort of yearning and hope for the young Panther Paw and his family.

209,Michael Kenmore,Best picture of 2006. Mr Gibson have proved his mastery in film-making.,10,24 December 2006,"As a fan of significant historical fiction films (my interest is in Mesoamerica & U.S. History which fascinates me all the time - especially the greedy & brutally genocidal Spanish Conquest and fiercely rousing iconic figures Andrew Jackson & Theodore Roosevelt), I was reserved before I went to see Apocalypto with my father two days after my 28th birthday as a ""belated"" gift to myself in regularly going to the movies on my annual birthday.It isn't easy choosing which movies to see because the holiday season is always crowded with choices. I thought about seeing Happy Feet (directed by Mel's ""mentor"" George Miller, the Australian genius behind the Mad Max franchise that gave Mel the career & capital as the world's most famous living actor) or Rocky Balboa before deciding on Apocalypto due to fairly positive word of mouth.My father, a WWII US-Japan conflict history buff, wanted to see Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jimo"" but it isn't playing anywhere in Utah on my short vacation this weekend. So we settled on Apocalypto despite its reputation for grisly scenes of violence & gore.As it turns out, my choice is wise. This movie is a masterpiece, and I mean that; I do not throw the word around lightly.It goes to show that Mel have a very confident & deft hand in quality film-making after gaining experience working on three previous films and his working with incredibly talented and highly skilled crew and cast to produce this film have reached a new level in achieving the visually, aurally and aesthetically astonishing historical fiction inspired by the chain of true events concerning the (fundamentally insane) culture revolving around the revulsion of human sacrifice rituals and the eventual fall of the bloodily corrupt & soullessly immoral Empire.I admit to not liking Braveheart (for its exaggerated historical inaccuracies, unintentionally humorous logical flubs & some melted cheese, even though I've seen the movie more than 10 times when I was a naive teenager) and The Passion of the Christ (awfully treacly slo-mo scenes & excessive graphic violence as the sort of numbing & unmoving ""Fangoria"" spectacle instead of inspiring genuine horror) but as they would say, ""all is forgiven,"" now that I have experienced this movie in the trance of being transported to another entirely alien world in the time machine made possible by the pure magic of film, as Apocalypto demonstrates with resounding success in inspiring genuine audience reactions varying from hilarious bawdy humor to throat-lumping sorrow to awe-inspiring horror to relaxing satisfaction and conclude with the end credit roll.This is the most expressive film I've seen in a long time, and it does just that with concise points in comprehension of facial and body language. Even more, this is minimalist at its finest in Avant-garde film-making besides the noble work of another fine movie director Terrence Malick (regretfully I still have not seen The New World at this time of submission, though the first three films are quite astonishing in haunting dream-like cinematography, philosophical minimalism & emotional depth). Mel have almost ditched his penchant for prolonged ""cheesy"" slo-mo and substituted that with ""step-print"" cinematic choice style that is incredibly effective in conveying horror, fear and tense action.Panavision Genesis digital cinematography, costume design, production design and make-up and deceptively subtle visual effect shots combined with Mr. Gibson's skills in directing the cast mostly composed of unknown and inexperienced actors have made it one of the most astonishing and visually lush films I've ever seen. Apocalypto now have the honor of sharing the impossible-to-produce-yet-achieved-against-the-odds realm with Lawrence of Arabia, The Wages of Fear, Intolerance, Walt Disney's Pinocchio, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and so many others.I do mean in the preceding paragraph above with utmost seriousness.I give my highest praise for Mel Gibson and the cast & crew for their grand work. Mr. Gibson is now the finest living filmmaker alongside Clint Eastwood, George Miller (last great film Babe: Pig in the City, that is), Quentin Tarantino, Brad Bird, Terrence Malick and ""I'm retired but won't admit it; wait till you see my next feature film in 2009"" James Cameron for perfecting his shot in the grandest esthetical sense in terms of organic master film-making on the fourth try that blow the audience patron's mobile electronics & media infotainment oversatured mind when he/she least expect it.Mr. Gibson deserves the allocade which I sincerely hope will be gracefully appreciated with good humor and wonderfully inspiring humility per his Traditonalist Catholic upbringing.Here come the Oscars on the march, Mel.

210,das417,Enduring Trials Of An Ancient People,9,23 December 2006,"Apocalypto is the story of an ancient people struggling to preserve their ways against forces from within.... And from without.Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young Mayan and the son of the village chief Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), finds his world consumed by fire and blood after a raiding party lead by slavers attacks his village. He watches his friends and father murdered and others, including himself, forced into slavery after being overtaken. Only the quick action of lowering his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and young son into a small cave saves them though they will face trials of their own. From there, he is thrust into a bloody world of human sacrifice, greed, and terror where he must use all of his skill to survive. Not only to for his own sake, but he must also struggle to rescue his family before they are lost as well.There are two parts to this movie with the first being that of Jaguar Paw's village life which we see as peaceful and isolated. The second is that of a world being torn apart through famine, disease, and death as Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers are taken to be living sacrifices for the Mayan god. Many could argue that this is Gibson's way of showing that when societies fall apart from within (as the quote from Durant explained in the beginning of the movie), they turn upon themselves. This is the case with the Mayans as we see them turn not only upon themselves, but also towards a madness that consumes them. Political correctness aside, there is no excuse for a society to turn upon its own weakest and sacrifice them for any religious belief. One could argue that the Europeans, who did butcher and murder thousands of the native peoples without excuse, were really no better than those they destroyed.Europeans due make an appearance at the end of the movie where we see Jaguar Paw and several of his chasers stop and stare with amazement at the sight of three Spanish ships off the coast. As a landing party approaches the shore, we are left with another sign that when society is weak it cannot stand up to outside forces. It is debatable if the Mayans and other peoples could have stood up to the Spanish if they were not falling apart or divided, however it didn't help. At their weakest time the Spanish arrived and were able to defeat them without much difficulty. There was much controversy over the movie for several reasons. The issue of blood, which many pointed out and even editors wrote of before the movie was released, gained attention. To be honest I didn't think it was that bloody even though there were times I had to cringe at the sites of sacrifice. Gibson should be honored for his use of the violence because all of it fit into the story because it did serve to show the moral of his story. This wasn't typical violence for the sake of showing people killed just for entertainment.The cast of Apocalypto deserves credit for their abilities. Gibson shows that by using ancient languages, and in this case the people themselves who spoke it, a good movie can be made that entertains and tells history. Let us hope that he makes more movies that can match Apocalpto in their drama and moral lessons. 9/10",Apocalypto
211,brettchatz-1,Film Review: The Apocalypto,6,6 February 2007,"The hunted becomes the hunter Mel Gibson's magic continues unabated  this time behind the scenes as the director and producer of this Mayan epic.Jaguar Paw, a villager from an ancient people faces his toughest challenge when his community is invaded by marauding warriors from the Mayan Kingdom.The film is set against the backdrop of spectacular panoramas and densely forested locales. The authenticity is further alluded to with strict attention to detail and the assumed dialect of the tribes.Apocalypto portrays, in graphic detail, the savagery of a people sworn to serve their deity. Their bloodthirsty conduct is fuelled by a voracious need to satiate the sun God's hunger with human blood.Eviscerations and beheadings upon specially constructed sacrificial alters are the norm in a society at its moral nadir.When the savages overrun a peace loving village and its tribesmen are enslaved, all hell begins to break loose.Jaguar Paw faces his inner-demons as he engages a barbaric enemy in a torturous game of death.He must first escape his fate as a sacrificial lamb and embrace his destiny as ruler of his people.While his very existence hangs in the balance, he must find his way to his beloved wife and child, to reclaim the forest that belongs to him.The action is relentless and the story is chilling.Apocalypto is not for the feint hearted but it is a bold effort by Gibson and deserving of its accolades.",Apocalypto
212,mcsheehey,An Absolute Masterpiece,9,5 May 2007,"""Apocalypto"" does something that films these days rarely do. It takes a cast of complete unknowns, throws them into super-expensive surroundings, and makes a great film. The cast is brilliant. Rudy Youngblood gives an especially fantastic performance as Jaguar Paw, the film's protagonist. Still, the acting is not the best thing about this film.The action in this movie is amazing. There are be-headings, animal attacks, waterfall free-falls, and intense warrior battles. The film grips you tightly and never lets go. The scenes are very intense, but amazingly brilliant. There's never a dull moment in the plot, and the screenplay is brilliantly written. It all leads up to a not-so-great ending, but is still a phenomenal picture.",Apocalypto
213,toll-8,A fantastic look into an old civilisation,7,20 March 2012,"Mel Gibson has lead a somewhat controversial career. He is a talented actor no doubt about it, but his private life and his religion have spilled into his public image and he has been a mess in front of the paparazzi several times. His directing career is also marred with controversy, especially with The Passion Of The Christ, which had faithful followers leaving cinemas in disgust. It can be said that he does touch some issues that most would not dare to. With Apocalypto he has touched on a subject matter unseen before on cinema screens, and he has also shown that no matter the controversy he is very talented. Apocalypto is a story within the Mayan culture. The Mayan's have been mentioned before in films but they have never been the soul subject. Here we see a peaceful tribe within the Mayans. Members spend their days hunting boar, setting traps and making babies, as well as mocking each other. The tribe is a peaceful community that lives in wooden huts. One day whilst out hunting, a separate tribe crosses them, stating that they are relocating. Many of their community are bloodied and seem to be desperately running. The other members, a young Mayan called Jaguar Paw (Youngblood) and his friends, warn the opposing tribe to not cross again as they don't want the trouble. Little are they aware that the following morning their peaceful tribe is disrupted by Mayan rebels, who murder, kidnap, and rape members of the tribe. These rebels search the jungle for captures that they take to the almighty leader in a Mayan City, where the women are sold as slaves and the men are sacrificed for the greater good. The Chief believes God is punishing them by plaguing their crops and the only way to repay him is to sacrifice members of their kind. As the Mayan rebels attack, Jaguar Paw manages to escape with his pregnant wife and son, who he lowers into a deep hole with the promise that he will return for them after he has helped his fellow tribe. Unfortunately he is defeated and taken captive with the rest of his tribe and lead across the jungle to the Mayan City. Once there Jaguar Paw witness' his tribe being sacrificed but is saved when a total eclipse is said to be a sign of God. Instead of being used as sacrifices, the captives are lead out to be target practice, but Jaguar Paw manages to evade the rebels, killing the leader's son in the process. Being the target of the rebel's vengeful rage he disappears into the jungle, leading them to his parts where only he can fight back and free his family from the deep hole he left them in.The story is intriguing. It is interesting to see a story from an angle we haven't seen before. The Mayan culture is really brought to life by Gibson, albeit I don't know how they lived and looked, but he has managed to show us a believable resemblance. They run around with little clothing, large piercings split through their noses, ear lobes, and lips and hunt for food with wooden spears and bear traps. Gibson manages to show all this using relatively unknowns in the roles, and each one of them nails their character perfectly. To be honest it wasn't like I was watching people acting like Mayans, I believed they actually were.The film does have many violent scenes in it. Most noticeably in the final forty five minutes which is a constant adrenaline rush as we follow Jaguar Paw's run from his captives with them in hot pursuit. Spears and arrows land in torsos, but the blood isn't over the top and outrageous but subtle and believable. Also in the opening scenes we see violence, with the rebels attacking the village, but most of the graphic scenes are hinted at off camera.Apocalypto asks many questions. It shows that genocide took place well before we existed, and shows how they would do all they can to continue their civilisation. The ending shows the Spanish Armada approaching and the Mayans ask the question of do they run to man or do they continue the way they know. They know how to fight and Gibson shows their struggle with passion and emotion.It really is a solid film. It is highly enjoyable and shows a civilisation unknown to us. The acting is strong and the direction is brilliant. Despite at times where there were a few slow moments, at two hours twenty minutes there could have been cuts, it is still a solid film and one that I do recommend. It is nothing like I was expecting and shows many themes that we should acknowledge; civilisations destructs from within, so why fight each other? Strong film, strong message.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Apocalypto
214,pied,Beautifully Done,10,6 October 2007,"I thought I would be grossed out by the violence in this film. However, it is so artistically done, I forgot to be horrified and just went along for the ride. And it is a ride!The Mayan civilization is collapsing; its people kept pacified by human sacrifices and bloodThis is basically a chase movie about a man who wants to save his family and survive. He is a savage and primitive but you can sense his essential decency.This movie held me on the edge of my seat from its beginning until the missionaries arrived.",Apocalypto
215,Artemis-9,Almost a 10,9,7 January 2007,"For me, Jaguar Paw (Youngblood), the predictable single hero, runs too much and is much favoured by Destiny for this to be the Perfect Film of the Year. As it is, it's still a powerful human tale of great simplicity, that went to extreme, minute historical detail, to bring us back five centuries and watch - in suspense and awe - how a great civilization that was able to predict the succession of the eclipses of the Sun, came to an end, amidst an incompetent ruling class, submerged to the wit of indisputable religious leaders, all acclaimed by a population that lived out of exploring forced labour, kept entertained and high on drugs and rhythmic chants. No - we're not speaking of present day's politics... Though we could be. All the horrors committed among American natives did happen, and that's historical proof they could meet an apocalyptic end by themselves. Destiny wanted it otherwise. The ships' sails (last scene) brought indeed the apocalyptic end by a greed for gold and power even greater than the worst specimen of the natives had shown us. Despite all the enhancements that digital video and hi-fi sound is able to, I advise you to watch this film in a good theatre house. This is a masterpiece for sound (yes, you can hear flies fly in the background), and picture, taken by great cameramen that place you in the very middle of a natural forest. My advice to parents: if your sons and daughters are able to stomach graphic violence and a birth, and if you can have a long talk with them just after leaving the cinema, this can be a powerful way to convey high standards of humanity to them, and explain them what death, life, and love are all about. You can not say the same for the last 300 movies you've seen together with them on your living room, ha?",Apocalypto
216,ssto,what an amazing movie,10,9 June 2007,"Mel Gibson did it again! this movie is amazing and simply shows what a creative person can do when it is independent of studio requirements, producer demands and bored audience...shot beautifully, with authentic characters the movie tells a simple, yet touching story of love, honor, family, duty and self dignity - but it doesn't use any big, flashing words for us to understand easily - its all in the action, in the eyes of the characters it starts with the everyday life of a simple tribe, living free in somewhere in the jungle, but destiny has other plans for them...basically its the story of a young man, trying to stay alive and save his family, but we get a beautifully mastered glimpse at the life of the great culture of the Mayans, like a trip through time...its just EXCELLENT ! congratulations to Mel Gibson for making this movie 10/10peace and love",Apocalypto
217,reverendtom,wow!,8,10 December 2006,"Mel Gibson is completely and totally insane, and the movie world is benefitting from it. To say this movie is crazy is an understatement. Its also really, really awesome. Not quite as violent as the reviews would have you believe, but still full of shocking scenes. Its a story that has never been given justice in cinema, the ancient Mayans. Leave it up to crazy Mel to give us a Mayan opus. The movie is wild and action packed from beginning to end, and it reaches a fever pitch of insanity in the last half hour. You literally cannot believe what you are seeing on the screen. Its like ""what next, Mel?"" He threw everything and the kitchen sink into this movie. If you are interested in the ancient Mayans, or just want to see a kick ass action movie, go see it!",Apocalypto
218,the_Poppuns,Perfect,10,8 December 2006,"In a normal year Mel would win Best Director for this movie. You really have to really know what you're doing to make a movie like Apocalypto. I'm sure a lot of people aren't going to see this movie for the same wrong reasons that he won't win (or probably even be nominated) but this movie was fantastic. My blood is still pumping from watching it. It's basically a story of one group of Mayans who are living a relatively peaceful life until another group with more sinister intentions shows up. Once that happens and that's pretty early in the film you follow Jaquar Paw, played by Rudy Youngblood, on a heart-pounding quest for survival.Let me say right away this movie is violent. I didn't really like The Passion of the Christ because I thought that that film focused too much on the violent aspects of those events and skimmed over everything else. However in this story I think the violence is just right. Which is to say, there is a lot of it. Well maybe it's more of a quality over quantity issue because when it is violent it is with gusto. There is a scene with what I thought was a panther, but is I guess is a jaguar, maybe that's the same thing I'm not an animal person. Anyway that scene is a lot to take, but it's quick. So if you're at all squeamish and you intend to see this movie, I'd say go, but know that that's a good time for a potty break. There's no real need to review the acting. The actors all did a great job but it's so much about just enduring and making it out of a seemingly impossible situation that there wasn't a lot of time for intense monologues. And in that way people who enjoy movies like The Fugitive or Speed should enjoy it for the action alone. But beyond that it's a very well made film. We don't actually know what happened back then but this is just as likely as anything else. As I was sitting there I thought to myself this could have easily been another Cleopatra. I mean it's one of those ""cast of thousands"" movies that people don't make anymore or they if they do they usually make it solely in a computer. Mr. Gibson really goes out on a limb to make a gigantic spectacle of movie that should impress any movie buff. I tend to think that anyone who dismisses it out of hand probably reviewed it in their head before they even saw it. I definitely think it's worth everyone's money, the only caveat is the violence. It could have gotten more than an R, in my opinion. But apart from that I can't think of anything anyone could complain about. I was really blown away by it and as much as I love the Departed, and I do, I have to admit that from what I've seen so far this year, Apocalypto is the most deserving of Best Picture.",Apocalypto
219,moimoichan6,What if... Disney makes a gore movie,6,29 January 2007,"After his gore version of the Bible, Mel Gibson continues his cinematographic exploration of forgotten languages, with ""Apocalypto"", the first movie entirely in Mayan. But no mistakes here, the fascination of the actor for old dialects only hides esthetic's concerns, and doesn't have any realistic purpose, for the movie is an absolute fantasy and doesn't have any historical exactitude. Mel Gibson prefers here beautiful frames and metaphors to historical facts, and only wants to make a nice adventure movie, in a Disney's style - with a young warrior, who overcomes his fears and become a adult after a series of challenge. You won't find any reflection about the fall of the Mayan empire here, nor any lesson about their way of life, but a fun adventure movie, with big action scenes in the jungle, fearless Mayan hunters and ""Hokuto no Ken-like"" villain Mayan warriors (this movie still wears the mark of ""Mad Max"").But if the movie is a classical Disney adventure movie, sometimes a little childly (see the eclipse scene, for instance, directly inspired by the one in the comic : ""Tintin et le temple du soleil""), it's still rather bloody and even a little gory, but not to much, don't worry. The blood scenes are ""for all audience"", because these kind of violence is far from or reality : of course, when a Jaguar eats the all head of one of the bad Mayan warrior, its a little bloody, but it doesn't happen often in everyday life. That's why I think this movie is highly enjoyable by kids and teenagers, who can watch this movie like the new ""Jurassic Parc"", for instance.Indeed, that's exactly the kind of movie I would have love when I was 13 years old, but which seems a little puerile to me now. Of course, the utilization of the Mayan culture as a metaphor for our occidental world is interesting, but Gibson - and that's certainly for the best - doesn't really fill it and rapidly prefers to create a fantastic and decadent atmosphere rather than deliver a message about the rotten roots of our civilization.So, if you like the beautiful poster of the movie, and want to see a good adventure movie, with a lot of running in the forest and a Jaguar eating people's faces, you'd like the movie. And if you're wondering if you shall let your 13 years old son watch this movie because of its violence, don't believe the hype, he'll enjoy it more than you...",Apocalypto
220,bilahn,A new low in immorality,4,10 December 2006,"After The Passion, I didn't think it was possible for Gibson, or anyone else, to sink any lower. The Passion for me, was worse than a gratuitous slasher movie like Saw, because it had pretensions of seriousness, wedding violence to religious faith, using cinematic technique that was almost breathtaking in its achievement.Apolcalypto is more violent and shocking than the Passion and the filmaking is of amazing finesse (hence my four stars rather than the zero it deserves). Yes the atmosphere is frequently thrilling and there are moments of brilliance like I have rarely seen. Gibson is one of the most amazing directors living today.But at what moral price? There was much more to the Mayans than their well known brutality. This movie is racist and false.I am not sure what the ending means but could it be the ""salvation"" of Christianity? Or of the beneficent entrance of the white man to tame the savage? What chutzpah. One might think it means that things are about to get even worse, but coming from Mel, I find that unlikely.The Mafia were brutal too, but the violence in The Godfather is judicious and more than adequate to make the point. What is the point in reveling pornographically on the violence in the most lurid sensational way imaginable? Braveheart was far better than Apocalypto, because while the violence was still more than necessary, it was relatively judiciously employed and in the context of an important story. I actually saw that movie on TV stripped of the worst violence and it was very powerful. Do that with The Passion or Apocalypto and there is basically no movie left.Let's not kid ourselves - pretensions of historical importance and a ""message"" are nothing but a smokescreen for what this movie is: A Horror Movie. And one that makes ""Saw"" look like Sesame Street. People are going to see this movie to see the violence. Yes, the movie is brilliant and gripping in many ways. All the more reason to condemn Mr. Gibson for using his formidable talent for bad purposes.Movies like this are part of the problem, the glorification of violence as entertainment, and this case, with the veneer of seriousness.Predictably, those who were bludgeoned into religious rapture by The Passion are singing the praises of Apolcalypto for its triumph of ""family values"". I find this sickening beyond belief. And how fascinating that Mr. Gibson has managed to make ultra violence noble, uplifting, and suitable for the entire family. Shame on him for subjecting people to things they would never choose to see otherwise. If people want to learn important lessons of history, there are many many better movies to chose from. Shame on every critic who has given this movie a ""100"" because of its undoubted merits, without understanding its racism, inaccuracy and moral vacuousness.I reluctantly give Apocalypto 4 stars for movie making merits. It really deserves a zero, and I think people should really consider whether they want to take money from their pockets to support this. I know I am ashamed I did.",Apocalypto
221,tenthousandtattoos,Faint shadows of greatness lost in obscurity and pointlessness,3,17 July 2007,"Normally I don't comment on films that leave me hitting the STOP button at midnight on a worknight and going ""I can't believe I stayed up for that crap!"" but I felt compelled to give a review on this for anyone, like me, who is very interested in the mysterious Mayan culture, and fascinated by these warrior-hunter-gatherers and the ways in which they carved out a majestic existence among the fog-shrouded mountains and jungle valleys of the Americas. Because, I warn you now, STEER CLEAR of this. This film will do absolutely NOTHING to enlighten you about this ancient civilization. You will learn nothing of their ways, their familial interactions, their customs (aside from the fact they tattooed and pierced themselves and hunted wild animals...gee what startling revelations), or traditions. You would be much better off reading about this stuff on the 'net or better still, get a book. Believe me, the real history (what scant little of it there is) is far more interesting than this film.Okay, let's break down some plot, what little of it there is: Jaguar Paw's (Rudy Youngblood) village is attacked one dawn by a marauding band from a much larger tribe (who are semi-civilised in that they are constructing those famous Mayan temples). He manages to secrete his family away down a hole to the rear of the village out of sight. So we know he's gonna come back for them. The evil tribe kidnap most of the good tribe, killing some, and lead them for days through the jungle to their temple, where they are to be sacrificed in the name of the Sun God. Our man Jag manages to slip the noose, so to speak, and runs off into the jungle beginning an almost 1 hour chase scene through thick jungle, during which Jag outsmarts his pursuers and kills em all, and rescues his wife and children. Oh yeah and in passing we see some tallships, supposedly signalling the beginning of the end for our Mayan friends. But Jag et al live happyuntil their civilisation dies out I guessThe end.I'm not sure I ""got"" this movie and I'm pretty damn certain that if I didn't, I don't want to. I guess you could say the theme of it is that the more ""civilized"" tribe ended up being the more brutal, while the guys eking out existence in the deep jungle ended up being the more humane. I personally think this message could have been SLAMMED home a lot better with a story about the conquistadors and the brutality they wrought on these indigenous people (because if you don't know already, the Spanish invaders made the tribal bad guys in this film look like angels of mercy).I just couldn't see the point of this film. Character-wise it had nothing. Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is the best of a bad lot. He's charismatic and has strong eyes. Okay the other charactersI wasn't introduced to the women of the tribe for long enough for me to care one way or another what happened to them. The men? They were crass weirdos who seem to REALLY enjoy joking about each other's sexual prowess (or lack thereof) andwait for itthere are TWO, count em, TWO testicle jokes within the first 20 minutes of this film. Scenery wise there were a few nice establishing shots of foggy jungle and maybe a sunset or sunrise here and there, but on the whole I was extremely unimpressed. The cinematography in at least a dozen other, less expensive movies was leagues ahead of this. There was a great POV shot from the eyes of a severed head as it rolled along the ground, and a nice tracking helo shot over a waterfall, but that's about it. Music was some equally unimpressive pan-pipe stuff with some tribal drums.Gotta give it to the Production Design though I must admit. The Mayan temple scenes are very well done, and ALL costuming and make-up looks spectacularjust a shame it couldn't have been a better movie though.Finally, two gripes: the Mayans are depicted as very bloodthirsty, and very stupid. It's not really fair. In this film it is (not subtly) alluded to that this big tribe has sacrificed THOUSANDS of people, and they are stupid enough to leave a massive pile of unburied corpses RIGHT OUTSIDE their city. People were smarter than that.Another thing  a beautiful black jaguar is killed in this film, when they could have easily just had it run off into the jungle. No. We are treated to a frenzy of ugly tribesmen stabbing and bashing mercilessly at this majestic beast until it's dead. Thanks Mel. That one scene alone will ensure I NEVER watch this film again. In fact, I'm sorry I saw it once.Go on, click ""No"" to finding this comment useful...you know you want to!",Apocalypto
222,MovieGuyFunTime,Stunning Acheivement with Unique Story,10,9 June 2021,"Apocalypto tells an enthralling and heart-felt story through incredible visuals, brilliant actors, amazing sets, breathtaking action and little dialog.The film speaks to the evils of tyranny over a brain-washed population (the Mayan) who regularly make human sacrifices to appease their sun god. This keeps the order- at least for as long as they have humans to sacrifice. The evils of man perpetrated against man are tragic yet timeless. Indeed this scenario played out all over the world in all civilizations at one time or another. The Mayan, however, perfected the spectacle of the human slaughter perhaps only to the same level as the Romans in their arenas of death.With such insanity and brutality as a way of life, it signifies the apex of Mayan society as this spectacle of slaughter (which keeps the population in line) is the only way for the powerful to stay in power. The madness goes against the natural order and cannot last. The weakened civilization will collapse under its own debauchery or from some outside force which will hasten its fall.There is a reason the Mayan civilization is no more and it isn't because of one man, which is what most history books will claim.",Apocalypto
223,jake-179,"PREDATOR, but this it is in the South American Rain Forrest!",7,25 December 2006,"This movie was about a bunch of people in the FORREST! (Not to be confused with Forrest Gump.) As my friend DJ pointed out, Apocolypto was really good at RUNNING! Apocolypto ran for most of the movie without ever getting tired! He ran AS FAST AS HE COULD without even taking a breath for a FULL TWO DAYS! It seemed like this movie was just another rip off of PREDATOR. Yes, you read that right. Apocolypto is running from bad guys and fights them the same way ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER fought the Alien in PREDATOR! Apocolypto even uses the same SPIKE trap thing to kill the GUY! I was shocked that Apocolypto didn't start yelling, ""I'm here! Come on! Do it! Kill me now! I'm waiting."" Just like Arnold! But Arnold is WAY more built than Apocolypto ever hoped of being. But then again, there are no body building gyms in the FORREST! They should have put Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of Apocolypto instead of the guy with the REALLY BAD TEETH! EVERYBODY in this movie needed BRACES like CRAZY! Also, I didn't see any real problem with the RAIN! Why was Apocolypto so worried about the rain? Obviously, he thought his girl and child would DROWN...why didn't they FLOAT? If the rain water fills up the hole they were hiding in, they could just FLOAT to the top! I think he just wanted it to NOT rain so he could take credit for saving them from the hole! That way his girl (with bad teeth) would want to have sex with him again! Not to give anything away, but I thought it was weird at the end when the Pirates of the Caribbean saved Apocolypto from the bad guys. All in all, I would have liked this movie better if the actors had BRACES! I liked the pyramid, though. But the pyramids of Egypt are surrounded by SAND, NOT RAIN FORREST! Hello MEL Gibson! Do your HOMEWORK! If you watch ANY History Channel documentary on the Pyramids, they ALWAYS show them in the DESERT, not the rain forest.

224,writerasfilmcritic,A Very Disappointing Effort From a Talented Director,4,29 December 2006,"Favorably impressed with ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion of the Christ,"" I took in ""Apocalypto."" At first, nothing much happened save for the hunting down of a poor scared peccary by some primitive, jungle dwelling Indians, after which their subsequent lame attempts at sexual humor fell absolutely flat. Soon enough, it became apparent that this flick was not going to be worth the money I'd spent on the two discount tickets. After the vile and barbaric ""Mayans"" suddenly appeared, killing anyone who resisted and taking the rest prisoner, I quickly lost interest in anything save for how the lead character (""the kid"") was going to avenge his dad's summary execution at the hands of the cruelest and most evil one among them. Mel Gibson obviously wanted to paint a very unappealing picture of the gaudily scarred, tattooed, and pierced vermin he called ""Mayans,"" but as others have pointed out, the actual Mayans reportedly had developed a fairly high level of civilization in the Yucatan Peninsula which historians have compared favorably to the Egyptian culture in the Nile River Valley. By most accounts, the Mayans did not conduct human sacrifice to any appreciable degree and were more or less defunct by the time the Spaniards landed in Mexico, the first Europeans on the scene. Their ruthless leader, Cortez, conquered weak, less organized tribes than the dominant Aztecs of Central Mexico, and using them as conscripts, built his limited corps of ""marines"" into a substantial army, finally toppling the Aztec Empire, which was led by Montezuma, hence the phrase ""Montezuma's revenge."" The Aztecs had been subjugating the same weaker tribes and conducting human sacrifices, perhaps even mass sacrifices on occasion, which I recall were known as ""Autos de Fe."" Of course, you cannot say that Gibson was really depicting the Aztecs because they built their civilization in Central Mexico around present day Mexico City, not in the Yucatan Peninsula where the Mayans had reigned centuries before.Aside from all that confusion, the movie was illogical and, for me at least, rather boring. An inordinate amount of time was spent watching as the prisoners were marched through the jungle to the Mayan city and its sacrificial altar, where without any further ado, they had their hearts cut out and their heads cut off. Strictly as entertainment, that part of the movie was probably the best because it was so gruesome, what with the sight of heads bouncing down the steps of the pyramid to the bloodthirsty crowds below. However, when an extremely convenient eclipse interrupted the gory show (a trick that's been overused in Hollywood), saving our erstwhile hero just before his untimely end, the remaining prisoners were made to run a gauntlet, supposedly to earn their freedom or die trying. Even the head Mayan warrior joined in this sport, although otherwise he was presented as having some vague standards of honorable, if brutal conduct. The kid was the only one to escape the gauntlet, but instead of allowing him the freedom he'd rightly earned, the Mayan thugs took after him because he killed ""the finisher,"" who just happened to be the head warrior's beloved son. For the rest of the movie, they all ran barefoot through the jungle at breakneck speed for miles on end, never making a misstep and never getting out of breath. Wounds that should have killed or seriously handicapped the kid he merely shrugged off. A thunderous waterfall that should have killed them all took but one life and the chase was resumed. Using one trick or another, the kid finally began to realize that he must become the hunter and started to kill off his pursuers one by one. At the conclusion of this ""epic,"" the white man arrived to rid Meso-America of the Mayan scum, which of course is completely at odds with history. I must have been looking the other way because I didn't see any particularly wonderful shots of the jungle. The basic theme was man's inhumanity to man, the strong survive, and the weak meet their fate. I suggest you wait for the DVD but don't expect too much. Better luck next time, Mel.",Apocalypto

226,starlit-sky,Good vs Bad - set in the Mayan civilization,7,15 January 2007,"Mel Gibson's movie is not really about the Mayan civilization. The Mayan civilization (or the Aztecs) provide only a setting to the story which is really about one man's trying to escape from his captors. A tribe in the forest is attacked by another tribe that kills and captures their victims. And yes, there is a lot of violence. It seems Mel Gibson makes the violence done by men onto other men the central theme of his movies. In many ways, this movie reminded me of the Braveheart (or produced the same kind of feelings as did the Braveheart). There is even one scene where someone gets killed exactly the same way as in the Braveheart. In some other ways, it reminded me of Rambo-The First Blood where Rambo runs into the forest and challenges his chasers.The hero of our story is brought to the Aztec city and he has no clue what future holds for him there. Pretty soon we find out the horrible plans set out for him by his captors. The violence in the Aztec city is just (especially at the sacrifice altar) incredible. Mel Gibson did a really nice job of creating the atmosphere none of us today can even imagine. I have watched so many horror films, and even I was disturbed by what went on the top of that pyramid. But what really impressed me was the costumes and the make-up (this movie should definitely be at least nominated for best costume and best make-up).Overall, this is a story of chase, a man trying to outrun his chasers and one that keeps the audience interested. But other than that, it is not very original. Most of the time, you can pretty much guess what is going to happen next. I give it a 7 out of 10.",Apocalypto
227,seveb-25179,Stranger Than Fiction,8,23 September 2018,"Who needs Sci-Fi when we have history?
Years before James Cameron fabricated a culture of primitive blue men fighting a technologically superior one in Avatar, Mel Gibson had already given us a culture of primitive blue men having their hearts cut out on the altar of a technologically more advanced one, plucked straight out of our own planets history.
Are the Navi really any more alien or colourful than those the pre Columbian natives of the Yucatan?Director Marc Forster declared that he wanted ""Quantum Of Solace"" to be, as he put it, ""Like a bullet fired from a gun.""
Mel shows him how it's done and ""Apocalypto"" is ""Like an arrow shot from a bow"".
A wonderfully crafted film by the most influential action director of his generation.I hope Mel gets back on track and is able get to work on another project like this soon.",Apocalypto
228,lizziebeth-1,"A real education for everyone unaware of Mayan history, and a striking lesson in humility for everyone else. Spoilers.",10,19 April 2008,"A brilliant semi-surprise: the trailers actually undersold it a little. Apocalypto(2007) is very ambitious, beginning with historian William Durant's quote about self-destructive civilisations. Richly informed by dead-on cross-cultural perspectives, it has a full story arc for its real subject: Mayan civilisation. Kevin Reynolds' Easter Island movie performed a similar function 13yrs before, but Rapa Nui(1994) was far less well resesarched, or realised.   Writer/director Mel Gibson and co-writer/co-producer Farhad Savinia are so good together that they rival Ridley Scott, and easily surpass Roland Emmerich's ripoff 10,000BC(2008) with its ""poorer-screenplay-beefed-up-by-mastodons"". Actually, if Hollywood wanted to compare practical vs CG sets, here is the clear winner.   It was the same with Peter Berg's hit The Kingdom(2008). CGI, even when cheap, should be used only as an adjunct to reality.....not its replacement. Gibson too has shot practical sets/effects, albeit from every angle, allowing him to cut them together in such kinetic fashion. He then honed them to perfection with hundreds of tiny--TINY--digital effects.Additionally, Gibson proves powerfully adept at both scene construction and casting (his distinctive Maya are all memorable). He's like Clint Eastwood now, garnering industry respect as a director.  Apocalypto has been dubbed a ""make-up-and-hair movie"" with its hundreds of extras all fully dressed. Dean Semler's cinematography has the film's intricate yet grimy Mayan fashions virtually roar off the screen with their vibrant colors and heretofore unseen detail. But Apocalypto is so much more than that. It's nothing short of a university education-cum white-knuckle thrill-ride, as the hero is forced to run for his life.   The tapir hunt taught us (for later) that rainforests hold many man-made traps, and that the repugnant Mayan tradition of bloodletting and sacrificing human hearts stems from routine tribal traditions of doling-out the best carcass-portions to the ""most deserving"" from the hunt.   Realistic indigenous Everyman Jaguar_Paw(Rudy Youngblood) gradually becomes remarkable through exceptional circumstances, as the massive individual differences between one Maya and another are revealed. Eventually Jaguar_Paw's fate reminds us of Dutch(Schwartzenegger) in the original Predator(1987)--except that his predating ""aliens"" are also Maya.   This clash of cultures is the film's central theme; clearly blissful ignorance can turn to mortal peril on a dime. The hero's emergence into mature wisdom about his lack of preparedness for the big wide world feels like wisdom to us, too, since we identify with him.   The not-well-explained fear-ridden tribal encounter was conveying that (contagious) fear is the enemy, because man's ill-treatment of their own is just cultural inadequacy towards biology. This gets tragically cemented by religions borne of additional political ignorance of a nation's role in the unexplored world. In a vacuum, the tendency is to self-aggrandise, so we often get the leaders--and religions--we deserve.The film is by design often a silent, visual communicator; cinematography alone carries much of the meaning the audience needs to get the story. For such a film to work at a length of just over 2hrs is quite extraordinary.   Events unfold at a clipping pace. Before we realise which way the story's headed, the sleeping village is razed and the wise chief wantonly assassinated/murdered. The method is chillingly authentic, hinting at the Maya's grizzly religious practices.Gibson interweaves the prisoners' trek to the temple with National Geographic archaeologist Richard.D.Hansen's real explanation for the failed crops and famine, which the obsessed Maya were supposedly trying to reverse with sacrifices. We see the city surrounds deforested, causing some diseases directly, in addition to subsequent diseases of malnutrition, as the clay runoff killed the swamp soil they relied on in the cities. The crammed city's shanty-towns would further exacerbate sickness with lack of hygiene--routinely found in present-day tenements too.   Hansen's conclusions revealed that lime-dust settled in the Mayan workers' lungs, making them cough up blood, just so the nobility could have their conspicuously consumptive plaster.As the prisoners are herded through the fabulous temple markets, we witness the unconcern of Mayan nobility (the word ""jaded"" heralds from this very context). They trade in ""slaves"" and eagerly enjoy their ritualised murder for the sake of maintaining their own sense of superiority. Historians now point out that Mayan ""warfare"" actually consisted of such predation upon neighbouring cities/villages merely for deadly ""sacrificial"" domination and humiliation.  Consequently I loved Gibson's treatment of the over-ambitious mother-in-law: once she and her village are enslaved, her mistreatment of her son-in-law Blunted(Jonathan Brewer, a Cree Indian cast as an odd-looking Mayan) finally stops, as the tables turn. She can only trail him to his ritualised sacrifice in the vain hope that either can save the other. She's finally ashamed of her past petty cruelties, her tribal ambitions nuked.   Once we finally set eyes on him, Gibson allows the murderous High Priest(Fernando Hernandez) to visibly whip up the crowd, his demagoguery actively modelled on the pernicious co-architect of World War.II, Benito Mussolini--whom Hernandez personally resembles.   The solar eclipse is a relief from the almost unbearable stress of witnessing the impending gutting of the mortally terrified prisoners. The High Priest intentionally misrepresents them as ""Warriors, unafraid and willing""! Aside his even more psychotic-looking King(Rafael Velez), the High Priest assures the masses--suspiciously presagely--that the eclipse will pass, because the celestial light-show is reliably well-known. It's a giggle watching their astronomer act possessed; even the director refers to his actor's performance as ""Papa Smurf"", because it's all an act: the Mayan elite are disingenuous with their followers, but are lethally psychotic with BELIEF in their own pre-eminence.   The similarities with today's sect-leaders and serial killers/Islamist Jihadis make the centuries between us just melt away. ""Let us learn the lessons of history"", Gibson seems to be saying with his latest film. Apocalypto is an education for everyone unaware of Mayan history, and a striking lesson in humility for everyone else.(10/10)",Apocalypto
229,kaaber-2,"Exciting, but hardly political",5,24 December 2006,"I had heard afore hand that Gibson's Apocalypto was supposed to comment on Iraq, but had a distinct feeling, when watching the film, that a very exciting plot had been added a minute touch of politics, and only in the High Priest's talk on the altar about the great Maya people and their (he almost said it) manifest destiny, that required blood every now and then to appease their god. IMO, one may as well try to find Iraq allusions in ""Happy Feet"". If we are trying to find allusions, US may as well be represented by the Conquistadors, arriving in the last moments of the film - and, in the context of this film, they arrive to put an end to the gruesome and gory Maya culture. The plot of the film is very small and simple, with hardly any subplots, but it is engaging. We have an out-and-out spotless hero in Jaguar Paw who strives to get back to his wife and kid whom he left in a hole in the ground when his village was raided by the Mayas. The pre-raid village is peaceful and ""people in the Happy Valley""-like, a terrestrial paradise that can hardly be representative of Saddam Iraq. The chase sequence that takes up one third of the film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, and is only flawed by that ancient movie cliché that we cut from a shot where the pursuers are three steps behind the hero, to a shot where the hero evidently has time to stop for a pensive close-up while pondering what to do next, whereas the pursuers are suddenly half a mile behind him - did they stop for lunch? But all in all, Eucalyptus or whatever the inscrutable title, is certainly watchable, and has reminiscences of Boorman's Emerald Forest (as well as Roots and First Blood) - but it is certainly entertaining.",Apocalypto
230,tonyjackie,OK but not great,7,22 February 2007,"This is the latest non-English speaking movie from Mel Gibson and although it's well directed and the cinematography is excellent,I think it's his least effective movie so far in his directorial role.It isn't a bad film at all,but for some reason it failed to connect with me in a way that I could care about the characters or what happened to them.The fact that the movie uses sub-titles isn't a problem at all.In fact it would have looked stupid if the actor's had spoken in English.I found the story to be a little on the thin side and toward's the end of the movie it seemed to almost develop into a sort of 'Rambo' story.So what don't I like particularly?Not much,the film is OK.Maybe there is too much slow motion at times and maybe the story is a bit far fetched.There is no doubt that Mel Gibson is a fine film maker.I just happen to prefer 'Braveheart' and 'The Passion of the Christ'.",Apocalypto
231,pninson,"Entertaining, but a bit silly",7,2 June 2007,"If there's a profound moral message embedded in Apocalypto, I can't make it out. Most of the movie is a long chase scene, with plucky Jaguar Paw picking off his pursuers, either through coincidence (a jaguar or a snake) or through snazzy feats of forest knowledge (using a frog's skin to poison darts).Apocalypto dazzles with its meticulous costume, makeup, cinematography and set decoration. The scenes in the Mayan city are almost as good as the work of Fellini (who had to work without computers). The action rarely flags, and it's a furious dash to the finish.However, the story relies so much on coincidence (a solar eclipse rescues our hero, from certain death), that by the end of the movie, when Jaguar Paw's wife is not only threatened with drowning in a well, but goes into labor at the same time, it's impossible to take this any more seriously than you would Armaggedon or The Rock.It's fun, but like too many modern movies, it relies on style rather than substance. Hopefully someday filmmakers will realize that real historical events can produce good stories, instead of just making up action pictures to fit their own version of events. As long as films like 300 and Apocalypto are raking in the cash, this is unlikely to happen.",Apocalypto

This film was a rush from start to finish, the adrenaline and frenzy of it kept me engaged throughout the duration, and it just didn't let up.The toughness of this film only adds to its realism and it's definitely not for the squeamish, think ""Passion of the Christ"" times ten and you'll get the idea. The performances (Entirely in Mayan) are first-rate on all counts as we empathize with our stories hero, Jaguar Paw and loathe his enemies who hunt him to no end.

If he was a David Cronenberg type of filmmaker, then that might give him some subversive cinema verite credibility. But Gibson makes films where a character yells ""I'm walking here"" to a fallen tree within half an hour of a heart-wrenching village massacre. Gibson has never been one for subtlety, which is perhaps why this is the third movie he's directed that features a man being tortured to death. But anyway... the plot... After Almost Jaguar's village is attacked by a gang of murderous Mayamen, he is taken to a Mayatropolis where the locals are loco and the beautiful pyramids are only slightly stained with blood. But Jag doesn't have much time to admire the apochitecture, he's gotta get home. But before he makes a run for it, he foolishly ruins a game of kill-the- captive when his lack of sportsmanship spells the death of an evil chief's son. The chief decides that Jag is a jag-off and he hunts him down with the intention of wearing his skin while he watches. Yuk! But this is Jag's jungle!

Nothing in this movie was new, Eclipses, human sacrifice, no the heart-cutting isn't really shown, the taking of slaves, even the Mayan city is just dull and beige. And yes, everything is in Mayan.

Basically a re-make of The Naked Prey (1966) starring Cornel Wilde. Having said that, it was an enjoyable action adventure, and slightly different from your usual Hollywood action flick of today. Gruesome realistic graphic violence lends realism, as Mel Gibson transports you back in time to the Yucatan jungles of the middle ages. The movie also has early on, a wicked sense of Mel Gibson's off color humor. I would recommend seeing this movie,however, if you are squeamish, there is quite an amount of graphic violence.

238,bondgirl6781,Adrenaline Pumping Action Film With A Message About New Beginnings,9,9 December 2006,"There has been speculation as to whether or not people would be interested in seeing a film about the Mayan civilization and it's decline. Would there be a story? Would there be violence? More importantly, would people see the film despite Mel Gibson's drunk antics from months back? I, speaking for myself and those who do not judge and are open-minded, say YES to all of the above. ""Apocalypto"" tells the story of the Mayans: their culture and their decline. Jaguar Paw is a young hunter in a small village with his beautiful, pregnant wife and young son when an army of city Mayans invade his village capturing and killing other members of the village. The captives females would be sold to slavery while the captive males would be served for sacrifice to appease the ""gods."" Jaguar Paw has no intention of dying and escapes: running through the jungles to return to his wife and son who are hidden in a cave with no way of getting out. Can Jaguar Paw escape the blood-thirsty Mayan warriors alive and rescue his family? The message of the film is pretty clear: the decline of a civilization as many before and the rise of new one. Mel Gibson's film is talking about us. Casting a group of absolute unknowns and accurate portrayals of the Mayan civilization is astonishing and beautifully realized in this tale that is both action-packed without cars exploding and guns and beautifully filmed. The film's star, Rudy Youngblood as Jaguar Paw, gives a star-making performance as a young man whose only means of survival is getting back to his wife and children. It is without a question an awesome film, but not for the faint of heart because of the strong violence and gore. But then again, Apocalypto is no more violent than ""Saw"" or ""Sin City."" It is worth it and Mel Gibson proves that he is a filmmaker and he will never stop being a filmmaker. I hope not either.",Apocalypto

When the captives enter the ""big city"" the natives covered in white, the extravagance , slavery , worship of violence and desperation are shown so subtly yet so powerfully . This part of the movie is by far the strongest. I love the overall theme of being your own worst enemy , fear eating you from the inside out and dedication to save and protect the ones we love .
The ending sealed the deal for me on liking this movie .

240,LBytes,"Great action, costumes and location shooting",9,21 June 2009,"The filmmakers spent a lot of time & money making Apocalypto look authentic. Although the end result is something of a mishmash of New World cultures and periods, Apocalypto is visually one of the most fascinating movies released lately. From the the beginning depiction of the life of a hunter-gatherer tribe to the eye-popping scenes at the Mayan city, you'd have to be dead not to be enthralled by it all. More than anything, however, Apocalypto is an action movie, and there's plenty of it. From start to finish you will be on the edge of your seat. No doubt others have noticed the similarity of the chase sequence to that in the classic 'Naked Prey', but that's not a bad thing. I had the most difficulty with the arrival of the Europeans during the time of the Mayans. That along with the bloodthirsty nature of the natives' ceremony seemed more in the realm of the Aztec.

241,HiddenVoice,Thrilling!But left me wanting for more and a little unsatisfied.But Gibson is an ingenious filmmaker and this is a terrific action-adventure film.,7,13 March 2007,"""A Great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within"" Mel Gibson's sometimes fascinating and sometimes disappointingly old-fashioned begins with the above quotation.But be aware,it has nothing to do with the film whatsoever.It sure might have some exciting and breath-stopping chases with first-rate Cinematography.It might mesmerize you with its visuals and its setting.But overall,it is still a Hollywood-ish film,directed with unconventional vision.Instead of giving us a film about the descent of the great Mayan civilization,it shifts its focus to a full-fledged Rambo in the jungle action-adventure thriller,reminiscent of First Blood.And,if Gibson wanted,he could've made a brilliant epic about the Mayan World and added some adrenaline rushed action and still retained its focus on the important story.But Gibson is too concerned in making loads of moolahs.Since,he knows that this film is not gonna be another PASSION OF THE Christ,he felt the urge to add something that will bring his audience towards his flick. From the trailers and all,I was really,really excited about this film.I was expecting a thought provoking and in dept depiction of the Mayan civilization's great fall.But of course,this is Hollywood,and it is only a rarity that would happen.But that is not to say this film won't entertain.Oh,it sure will.But I expected a lot more.The story begins as group of men and women live peacefully in a small village.We are introduced to their lives and we share a few laughs and joys in their lives,so that you feel for these people.But soon after,their small village get stormed by ruthless,savage Mayans,according to Gibson.He depicts Mayans as brutal animals.Our hero,Jaguar Paw,along with his people, are taken by the armed men from their village,while the rest of his people are either killed or raped,leaving children alive.Jaguar Paw manages to hide his wife and kid before the armed men capture them.He and his fellow men are then dragged through the jungle towards the heart of the Mayan city, where the sacrifices are already underway.Where you'll see heads roll,hearts come out,and a lot more.But none of that is as violent as stated.All the controversy and hype about its violence leaves you further disappointed,as there isn't much.It's just more realistically shown.Then as when it's time for Jaguar,he is spared as the solar eclipse interrupts and it is considered that God is satisfied.But as he is sent along with others to be disposed,he manages to escape and from there on,chases ensues and the entire story takes a big shift.And then it's all about running,lots of running,to save his family.Until the Spanish arrive.Gibson is a gifted director.And the way he directs this film,you have to praise him for it.Only,if he could have a better plot.The flaws lie in the tame script(But,no one would care about what the characters have to say) and its plot.It's a weak plot for such a big setting.His depiction of the Mayan World is unclear.But like PASSION,Gibson just transports us back to that period.He just have this way to hypnotize us and just take control of our imagination.And it is best experienced on the big screen.For that,I admire him.But his film's plot is really wobbly.He has a way to hold our attention for as long as he wants.And for this film,he holds our attention and imagination for most of the film.But his narrative is weak and flawed.The film's other strength is film's striking visuals.That's another of Gibson's strength,just as it was in PASSION.And I was surprised this film didn't receive any nominations for its Cinematography.The foot chases were marvellously shot and puts you on the edge of your seat.They were long and intense.It's got an excellent production design.It's bizarre at times and at the same time so unique in its execution.Authentic,realistic and mind-blowing.And at times,it looks like an artistic action film.The film is flawed,uneven and shifts to a totally simple plot outline.The first half of the film was striking,as we are taken into the Mayan Society and its stunning detail spent on its sets and costumes and its world.But then the second half's all out chases and thrills just turns it into an old-fashioned action-adventure film packed into a new cloth.The performances by the actors,largely unknowns,were convincing.And Rudy Youngblood fits perfectly into the lead role,showing great love for his wife and children and you sense the rush that he feels to return to them.And the other actors make it real enough to allow us to feel like we are at that period.Though,the Hero and his wife and a few other actors came close to leaving an emotional impact.But nevertheless,the film definitely leaves an impact.The violence is fairly realistically shown and I didn't felt like it was ""the most violent film ever"".It's nothing compared to other more violent movies.Heck,Flags of Our Fathers/Robocop had more graphic scenes of violence.All those claims were crap.I'd be damned if I weren't hooked into this film.And Gibson's film-making is the reason why you still enjoy this film.But only if it had a stronger plot,I would've considered it one of the most fascinating films ever made.But he is just trying to make a new kind of action film.One set in a time where many will find odd for an action film to be set.The only kinds of films set in ancient times that people are familiar with are those swords and sandals epics.But this one is different and set in a different place.So,it makes it stand out thrill-ride.Where PASSION was a passionate and emotional depiction of Jesus' last 12 hours, APOCALYPTO is a chase filled action-adventure that leaves you stunned by its execution.It's simple and straight to the point and devoid of political,social and current-situation-of-our-society commentaries.Gibson might be a prejudiced idiot as a person,and a big A--hole,not to mention,a total maniac.But he is an ingenious filmmaker.Give this film a look and you will be thrilled as you won't ""see"" anything like this in a long time to come.And I look forward to Gibson's next venture.",Apocalypto

244,LadyLiberty,Apocalypto Exceeds Expectations  and then some!,8,10 December 2006,"The plot of Apocalypto is a relatively simple one. A young forest-dwelling Mayan man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is living happily as a hunter with his pretty and pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and their young son. Jaguar Paw's father, Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead) is a tribal leader and a hunter himself. The day-to-day existence of the group isn't easy, but the rain forest provides well enough that there's time for practical jokes and storytelling.All of that changes when a group of men led by the terrifying Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo) invades the village and takes many of the adults captive. Jaguar Paw's wife escapes their predations only because he manages to hide her and their child in a deep natural well. Unfortunately, Jaguar Paw himself isn't so lucky and he's taken away along with the rest of the prisoners.After a long trek through the wilderness, the prisoners and their guards arrive at last at their destination: a Mayan city that's suffering from disease, crop failure, and even worse. It's not long before the prisoners learn that most of them have been brought to the city as sacrifices to appease the gods. Jaguar Paw, meanwhile, focuses on nothing but that he must escape to return to his village and rescue his wife.Jaguar Paw refuses to believe that his wife may be dead already, or that he himself might die. But even if he can manage an unlikely escape, he'll still have to get through Zero Wolf and his ruthless warriors, and past jungle hazards that even a man familiar with the forest might find deadly.That's really all that there is to Apocalypto. And yet there's much, much more.The actors cast in Apocalypto are almost all unknowns. All of them speak their lines in authentic Mayan; many didn't even know English. Despite what might be considered drawbacks  at least by some directors  the casting was such that each and every character is eminently believable, and using the Mayan language only made them more so.Dalia Hernandez, a college student studying dance, is just terrific despite having never acted before. Raoul Trujillo is terrifying, a fact that relies more on his telling expressions and body language than anything else he does or even some of the blood-curdling commands he gives. Rudy Youngblood, who has only had minimal exposure before capturing the lead here, is just fantastic. You can actually see the young man grow up and harden over the course of the film, and that takes real talent to convey something so subtle.The sets are spectacular in no small part because filming was done on location. In various interviews, you'll hear Mel Gibson talk of high temperatures, big bugs, and rainy seasons. But that in no way detracts from the awesome splendor of the jungle. With a brilliant cinematographer (Dean Semler) to capture the views, the film is visually breathtaking. Special effects and computers bring us much of the Mayan city, but it's often hard to tell what's real and what isn't because it's integrated so well.Although the plot is deceptively simple, the framework for the story is much less so. Apocalypto takes place as the Mayan civilization is undergoing a downturn. In fact, the movie opens with a Will Durant quote: ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" Though nothing is later in-your-face obvious, if you look, the signs of destruction are everywhere and that, too, is a part of the story. Once you see that, of course, it's impossible not to draw parallels with the world today.Mel Gibson co-wrote and directed Apocalypto, and he did both brilliantly. Despite being relegated to his characters expressing themselves via English subtitles, it's impossible not to get to know these people and to feel for them. Without cars or explosions, there are never-the-less chase scenes that rival the best and most suspenseful ever shown on screen. Say whatever else you will about Mel Gibson (I'm frankly of the opinion that we've all said something stupid at one time or another when we've had too much to drink), you can't take one thing away from him: The man is a genius behind the camera.I don't know how strong anti-Gibson sentiment in Hollywood remains today, but if Apocalypto is considered on its merits alone, it's going to be winning some awards. Certainly, it should be singled out for cinematography. Gibson deserves some real directorial recognition for this one as well. I also wouldn't quibble if Rudy Youngblood got some notice here.Apocalypto is over two hours long, and I'm not a fan of subtitles, yet the movie flew by. I was fascinated from the opening scenes to the end, and enthralled throughout whether I was horrified, appalled, amused, touched, or on the edge of my seat (in fact, I was all of these things at various times, and more than once). I had relatively high expectations for Apocalypto, and I have to give all due credit where credit is due: the film exceeded my expectations and then some, and I recommend it accordingly.POLITICAL NOTES: Gibson's point here is that it's true that the Spaniards brought down the Mayan civilization, but that they could probably not have done so if the civilization hadn't already been dramatically weakened by its own excesses. Even if you choose to be blind where the lack of environmental concern or the population issues are concerned, I suspect you can't ignore that parallel!FAMILY SUITABILITY: Apocalypto is rated R for ""sequences of graphic violence and disturbing images."" Let's be honest, here: hunting isn't bloodless, and human sacrifice is appalling. When both are presented in some detail, there's something to make everybody queasy. Still, the history and the point are stunningly and excitingly offered, and those of age 16 or so and up should be able to appreciate the whole package.",Apocalypto
245,terraplane,White man speak with forked tongue,1,15 February 2010,"First, this movie has nothing whatsoever to do with the Maya. Second, it has nothing whatsoever to do with history. Third, it has nothing whatsoever to do with entertainment.So all in all, it's a loser.And no wonder, seeing as it was made by the arch history re-writer of Hollywood.We all know Mel is a Christian, (although judging from the rather un-Christian events of his recent past, he might just find St. Peter slamming the pearly gates in his face when his creator decides to call his number)and it comes as no surprise to find uncle Mel showing us the error of the savage's ways and Christian salvation at hand in the final scenes.But I digress.Now, I don't know about you, but I like my movies to have either a story, a point to make, have good photography (as opposed to just looking nice) and be well acted. In short, a reason to exist. This piece of junk has none of these things.So what have we got?A sort of jungly slasher chase movie with added subtitles to make it look quasi-intellectual. How did this risible artifact of Gibson's febrile intellect ever get made, I hear you ask. The answer is Icon films. Owned by Gibson and Bruce Davey, and responsible for such gems of modern cinema as The passion of the Christ, this is the only way such a mess of a movie could ever see the light of day.It purports to tell the story of the end of the Maya civilisation, or some such nonsense, depicting the Maya as a bloodthirsty, murderous bunch of jungle dwelling psychos who apparently sacrificed thousands of young men to satisfy their Gods.Which is all very interesting, except they weren't and they didn't. But let us not quibble over mere details like truth. Gibson already has a criminal record in this area. Remember the travesty that was Braveheart.It wouldn't have been so bad if the storyline and the action held up to scrutiny, but it doesn't. I don't care how long you've lived in the jungle, you can't run for a whole day at full speed through the tropical rain forest in bare feet after an arrow has passed through your body. It's just plain stupid and an insult the audience's intelligence. Unless you're the kind of person that thinks Die Hard is a documentary. And that's the next thing. The photography is shocking. Parts of it look like a cheap TV movie shot on video while other parts look like out-takes from The Mission. Which is not surprising given that it was shot on a mixture of film stock and HD video.I can't quibble with the acting, inasmuch as most of the cast have never acted in a movie before.And so we get subtitles which have two functions. First, few, if any, of the cast probably speak English and second, it gives senor Gibson a chance to try and kid us that they are actually speaking ancient Mayan. Which they ain't. Furthermore, the subtitles themselves are farcical. The ""translation"", if you will, is no more than an attempt to ""Americanize"" the script with daft phraseology that is totally at odds with the people supposedly speaking it. Shakespeare it ain't.Watch it if you must but don't be taken in by the notion that this is anything more than another attempt by Mel Gibson to take your money under false pretences. As the original title said: Mel Gibson's Apocalypto.If he carries on like this, the apocalypse will come sooner than he thinks.",Apocalypto
246,yevonwm,A very powerful mantra,7,2 June 2007,"Considering how bad this movie could have been, its 10/10 but in fairness and rated against other movies its 7/10. There are no religious incantations - no controversial opinions of the bible, indeed it is just a straight up mel Gibson stab at a movie that will get him in the Hollywood history books and he did a pretty good job. The movie could easily have been confused for a TV documentary on ancient American-Indian history, not to make it seem bad but to give you a rough idea of what to expect. The plot is amazing, the twists are real and Gibson is not afraid to play with our hopes and fears for the protagonist. He's stayed true to exactly what have happened if this scenario had existing in real life and the story is believable enough to make you think twice about how you're running your own life. Definitely worth a bash - even worth the £4 I paid to rent it hehe.",Apocalypto
247,Baldrick44,Amazing,10,8 February 2007,"I have to confess that this is the first Mel Gibson flick I have seen ( I have seen ones he has starred in but not one where he is a director ). This is in no way due to a personal grudge I have against him, it's just that none of his other films seemed to be ones that I was fussed seeing at the time. However this one I did want to see, although perhaps mainly just to see if I could get through it after all the things I had heard.Apocalypto centers around the Mayan civilisation in Central America, whose nation by the time the story was set, had gone into decline due to overpopulation and overharvestation. The consequence of this is that people from the villagers are brought forth to the major centers to be sacrificed. The protagonist, Jaguar Paw, is such a captive, and finds himself in the situation of having to escape to find his pregnant wife and his child.There have been many complaints about the gore and blood in this film, but it is actually not too bad. Clearly Mr Gibson may have had to cut some imagery that would have been worse, but most of it mas been seen before, in one movie or another ( it is also worth noting that much of what happens here has been done to orcs in LOTR ). In fact, it is not much worse than Gladiator, with perhaps a little Temple of Doom thrown in.The Mayans have complained about the image that this portrays them as, and there is some merit to this in that Gibson paints the Mayans more as a loose confederation of villages rather than a full blown civilisation. However, he must be applauded at stages for managing to give a small glimpse of what this civilisation's structures must have been like in all their glory.Apocalypto is an amazing movie, with a wonderful last 45 minutes to cap it all off. The soundtrack is great, and the acting is good, with Raoul Trujillo the standout. It's not for everyone's taste, but if you can handle it, go see it.",Apocalypto
248,editor-299,"Gibson's Mayan tribute well-intended, but long-winded",7,5 December 2006,"Trying to overcome the bad publicity of his recent drunken, anti-Semitic rant, director Mel Gibson forges ahead with his tribute to the Mayan Indians during the 16th century. Facing a drought, famine and other outward signs of a declining civilization, the urban-dwelling tribes ravage the forest to capture prisoners for human sacrifices (heart removal, beheadings, you know, the usual).One of the leaders of a peaceful group, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), secrets his wife and small son in a well while his people are overwhelmed by the warriors and carried off to the city. Once there, however, Paw begins to fulfill a prophecy given by a girl with smallpox. While he's on the sacrificial platform, a convenient total eclipse of the sun occurs.He and other captives are spared this death, but turned over to the warriors, who make them run a gauntlet, of sorts. Of course, Paw gets away, but is soon pursued by a half-dozen battle-hardened braves.Meanwhile, Paw's wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and son are still trapped in the well, which is flooding in a rainstorm. Paw now turns into a Mayan 007, overcoming not only the enemy tribesmen, but the elements, as well.""Apocalypto"" is a very well-made film, and Gibson is certainly a competent director. Beware, though, because it is subtitled, so one will have to read the entire two and -a-half hours of dialogue (just like Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ""). Gibson's respect for this long-dead culture is evident, and he shows much respect for the natives who aboded here long before European explorers arrived.Lensing by Dean Semler (""Waterworld,"" ""Dragonfly,"" ""The Alamo"") is superb, the James Horner soundtrack is appropriately muted and the overall vibe of the movie is dark and foreboding, with plenty of blood and gore for those teenager boys out there.That also brings up a small problem I had. Now, it may seem easy to talk about ripping someone's heart out, but I would imagine that when it really comes down to it, a lot of effort is required. But imagine it really going down.In this picture, an incision is made and soon the organ is produced  still beating. No breaking or sawing of ribs or anything (not that I wanted to see this). Plus, in these scenes, there are about five sacrifices, more than enough to get the director's point across. Don't get me started about the heads being rolled perfectly all the way down a thin row of steps, either.Still, an overall good film which should make critics happy and will no doubt end up with some award nominations (even Gibson's tirades has been forgiven by then). The length is a tad bit long for my tastes, however. About 20 minutes could have been trimmed with little or no effect on the storyline.Whether the movie draws many to the box office remains in doubt, however. A subtitled niche film like ""Passion"" earned millions because many Christians went to see it; I cannot image a great ground-swelling of hidden Mayans clamoring to see this one.",Apocalypto

The reason being is the masterful film-making style of director Mel Gibson and cinematographer Dean Semler. Mel decides to give us a slice of life of Mayan culture by telling the gruesome tale of one particular family who lives a life based in the ways of the jungle struggling to survive in the midst of being over run by a brutal urban style tribe who's out to capture slaves and humans to sacrifice to their god to win favor.

251,jbirks106,"Brilliant, surreal visual storytelling",10,7 November 2014,"""Apocalypto"" is possibly the most visually stunning movie I've ever seen. A film with little dialog (subtitled no less) and no actors I've ever heard of, would seem inaccessible, and some scenes are so relentlessly gory that one wonders how Gibson got away with an R rating. This is nobody's idea of a great date movie, unless the evening began with a dinner of tapir testicles. Yet ""Apocalypto"" is one beautiful movie. Cinematographer Dean Semler, whose credits include ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Waterworld"", creates images so breathtaking that you almost forget you're watching a Hollywood feature and not a National Geographic documentary. Not since Werner Herzog's masterpieces ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Aguirre, Wrath of God"" have the jungles of central and South America been captured so vividly. Every scene, every shot, contains such rich detail that you scarcely want to blink lest you miss something wonderful.Unlike Herzog's films, in which natives are narrative outsiders, ""Apocalypto"" takes us into their world, dropping us as it were into the drama, horror and even comedy of daily life in 16th century Mesoamerica. We come to know the impotent man and his verbally abusive mother-in-law, the protagonist Jaguar Paw and his father, Flint Sky, and come to care deeply about their plight. Gibson has been criticized for his sensationalized depictions of senseless cruelty and barbarism. I don't think so. He's giving us an unflinching view of how cultures lived, and died. And if you think the Maya were cruel, you haven't read the Old Testament lately. The final scene, in which Jaguar Paw and his family behold a flotilla of European ships, is a poignant one. Have we just seen the Apocalypse, or is it just beginning?",Apocalypto
252,sullibrandon,A Disappointing and Clichéd Bloodbath,5,23 December 2006,"Featuring amazing performances by unknowns, breathtaking cinematography, and a captivating story relating to the demise of the Mayan people, Apocalypto is one word: disappointing. The movie falls apart at the halfway point, beginning with a massive cliché and unraveling into a string of senseless violence and further disgusting clichés.The movie opens with a remote tribe in the jungle on the hunt for a tapir. After a few minutes of quick, fast-paced chase, they finally catch it, and we see them bonding around the carcass. They journey back to their families and their home, and the next day their entire village is destroyed as everyone but the strongest warrior men are raped and murdered. It is a scene where all the blood and gore serve a definite purpose - to emphasize the tragedy. It does not feel extraneous - thought it is definitely not for those with weak stomachs. The tribe has been captured by the Mayans, a bloodthirsty warrior race who has kidnapped them for the purpose of sacrificing them to their gods so that the disease afflicting their crops may be lifted. They journey back to the Mayan city, along the way encountering a young sickly girl who ominously calls a prophecy after them.Once they reach the Mayan City, at the very apex of the story, everything, this fascinatingly crafted story, this beautiful, yet grotesque action adventure, everything, falls apart. Up until this point, everything was amazingly well done. Mel Gibson had made this long dead civilization come alive. The cinematography in the jungles was brilliant, the acting was first rate, and the violence served a very definite purpose and was not at all superfluous. Unfortunately, the cliché destroys everything. Once the cliché happened, I sat, stunned, in my seat, for a full ten seconds, unable to move. I kept on saying to myself, ""No, no, no, no."" It didn't work. The cliché ran its course as I writhed in agony, and even, honestly, shed a few tears. Such a beautiful work of art was being ripped apart at the seams as I watched. It might have been okay if it was just a normal cliché, but it is one of the cheapest clichés I've ever seen in films.It wouldn't end there, though. Determined to not let this one moment spoil the entire movie, I braced myself for the second half, hoping that it would redeem itself. No such luck. For the first ten or so minutes, the action was very good, but I was just still too distracted by the horrible cliché to care. I recovered, though, in time to see three different clichés, one right after the other. Bam, bam, bam. My hopes slowly dwindled away into nothingness. It was over. The violence was being used for the purposes of titillation. The supposedly breath-taking scenes had dissolved into nothing more than a clichéd jungle chase. There was lots of good gore, well done action, all that jazz, but it didn't matter. For the first half of the movie the gore served a purpose - now it was for none other than to excite. It all came to a head one moment at the very end where I literally laughed out loud at the sheer ludicrosity of the moment. How the mighty had fallen.The middle of the movie, where the cliché occurred, literally made me cry several tears. It had been going so perfectly - every moment had been crafted to perfection. If it hadn't been for the cliché, I might have even loved the second half - but the glaring error in the middle only made me notice the dozen or so other errors in the latter half. The cinematography and music continues to be amazingly well done, but the weakness in the story and the violence just destroys everything. Apocalypto may be worth a rental down the road, just for the exquisite first half, but it is definitely not worth a movie ticket. I'm giving it a 5/10 because half of it was good, and the second half wasn't bad enough to completely overshadow the first half. It is amazing, though, how one moment can ruin an entire movie. Why, Mel Gibson? Why?",Apocalypto
253,jordache-wee,Mel Gibson is a Brilliant Director but his Personal Life is Another Story..,9,22 January 2014,"Set in early 16th century, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his father Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), with their tribesmen encounter a group traumatized refugees while hunting for food. One of the group's leader told Flint Sky that their lands were ravaged, and asks for permission to pass through the jungle. When Jaguar Paw and his tribesmen return home, Flint Sky tells his son not to let the refugee's fear infect him.The next morning, after Jaguar Paw wakes from a nightmare with the vision of the refugee leader, he sees warriors entering the village and setting the huts on fire. Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), attacks villagers. Jaguar Paw slips out with his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernández) and his little son Turtles Run, lowering them by vine into a deep vertical cave, tying the vine off so they could climb out later.Jaguar Paw kills the raider and returns to help the village. But was captured and brought forth to his father by Middle Eye (Gerardo Taracena), whom Jaguar Paw almost killed, slits Flint Sky's throat while the bound Jaguar Paw can only watch in horror.In the city's outskirts, the female captives are sold as slaves and the males are escorted to the top of a step pyramid. The high priest sacrifices several captives, including Jaguar Paw's friend Curl Nose (Amílcar Ramírez), by cutting out their beating hearts before beheading them.When Jaguar Paw is about to be sacrificed, a solar eclipse (also prophesied by the girl) occurs. The high priest looks at the king and the two share a knowing smile while the people below panic at the phenomenon. The priest declares that the sun god Kukulkan, is satisfied with the sacrifices. He asks Kukulkan to let light return to the world and the eclipse passes. The crowd cheers in amazement and the priest orders that the remaining captives be led away and disposed of.Zero Wolf takes the captives to a open space. The captives are released in pairs and are forced to run the length of the open space within the open space, offering Zero Wolf's men some target practice, with a cynical promise of freedom if they can reach the end of the field alive. However, Zero Wolf's son, Cut Rock, is sent to the end of the field to eliminate any survivors. The raiders target the runners with javelins, arrows, and large stones.The first pair are Jaguar Paw's last living friends, Smoke Frog (Israel Contreras) and Blunted (Jonathan Brewer). Smoke Frog is struck by a heavy stone, then finished off by Cut Rock while Blunted is impaled through the stomach by a javelin.Jaguar Paw is shot through the stomach by an arrow. As Cut Rock approaches to finish Jaguar Paw, the not-quite-dead Blunted trips Cut Rock to buy Jaguar Paw time. Cut Rock gets up and savagely kills Blunted and turns to finish off Jaguar Paw, but is slit through the neck with an arrowhead from the arrowhead Jaguar Paw retrieved from his wounded stomach. In no time, he flees into the field and tries to run as fast as he can for his freedom.Jaguar Paw runs through a withered field and an open mass grave before finally reaching the jungle. The enraged Zero Wolf and his men pursue Jaguar Paw into the jungle and back toward Jaguar Paw's home.Along the way, one of the raiders is killed by a black jaguar angered by Jaguar Paw. Another raider is killed when a venomous snake bites his neck. Eventually, after running all night, Jaguar Paw finds himself caught between a high waterfall and his hunters and is forced to jump. He survives the fall and declares from the riverbank below that the raiders are now in his fatherlands.Zero Wolf commands that he and his men jump the falls as well. While most make it alive, one smashes his head on the rocks below and is killed. The remaining men swim to the shore and carries on their pursuit, but Jaguar Paw is prepared and camouflaged in mud, kills one raider with poison darts.He then confronts Middle Eye and bludgeons him to death with Mayan war club. It begins raining heavily which starts to flood the cave where Jaguar Paw's wife and son are trapped. He rushes to save his family, Jaguar Paw is confronted by Zero Wolf and shot again with an arrow. As Zero Wolf advances to finish Jaguar Paw he is impaled and killed by a trap for hunting tapir.Following Zero Wolf's death, the two remaining raiders chase Jaguar Paw to the beach where they encounter Spanish galleons, anchored off the coast, with soldiers making their way ashore. The amazement of the raiders allows Jaguar Paw to flee. He returns into the forest to pull his wife and son out of the flooded pit where they are hiding, and where Seven has just given birth to a healthy second son. Jaguar Paw tells his family to return with him to the forest. They head into the jungle in search of a new beginning.--This film explores the Mayan tribesmen and its civilization. Director Mel Gibson takes us on a journey to visit the culture and the language (Yucatec Maya). This is an artistic and historic film.And you wonder about the thousand steps at the Mayan Temple was actually a place to conduct a sacrificial ritual to appease the sun god by ripping your beating heart out and then beheading you to have your head rolling down the steps before the people below use you as their trophy.",Apocalypto

The film is 138 minutes and it needs every minute to tell Gibson's tale of the eventual fall of the Mayan empire... as it were! Now, don't read more into what the last paragraph is meaning; this is a chase movie and a survival story to the extreme degree! I was enjoying the process, but several times I remember thinking so myself, ""What is Mel trying to tell me here?"" His whole meaning comes together at the end, you hafta stay until the end to see his meaning! Simply put, people are fighting, dying and hurting one another for what they think is pleasing to their god and real trouble might arrive where you least expect it! Liberties are taken with time lines and some religious beliefs, but the spirit of what Gibson was trying to tell us is spot on! It's an exciting ride and very violent... not for the squeamish and faint hearted at all! Probably Gibson's best work as a story teller and with direction! A lot can be said about a movie that doesn't speak one word I can understand and hold my attention throughout it's complete run!

I think it's time people FORGIVE & FORGET the controversies involving Mel Gibson, and start to realize the talent he has! I watched this film, with not reading one summary or article about it, not knowing WHAT expect - it all came out fresh, original, and... just downright INTENSE! The direction, the acting, characters, the costumes, the tone, the thrills, suspense, the realism - much more engaging & creative than the overrated piece of Scorsese trash, ""The Departed"" was, or even the boring ""No Country For Old Men."" Scenes involving the occult human sacrifice scene though really showed how quite demonic or possessed these people looked (almost like the indigenous people in Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"". Some watching this movie may make the joke that Gibson likes to take blood baths, but hey, it's Hollywood's fault with the negative influence, not Mel's. To me, this flick reminded me of ""The Jungle Book"" (1994) when Mowgli tries escaping the bad guys, as one by one, they die in the jungle - and that's what also happens in this. This film really makes you root for the main characters, has a story that's unique & gripping, and the film all-round worked as a whole! I would've never guessed in a thousand years Gibson had directed this if his name didn't appear in the credits; or I probably wouldn't have even believed anyone if they told me it was Gibson's film!Bravo, Gibson!

257,IRateFilms,Gibson brings forth a Masterpiece,9,10 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's latest film can be surmised in two words, masterful storytelling. Although Gibson has been very controversial in his life away from the cinema, it is clear that this publicly proclaimed mad man does not have any problems behind the camera. Apocalypto, which tells the story of an ancient Mayan tribe, and their plight with another, more aggressive tribe, is Gibson's most perfect film to date. Since the film is spoken entirely in Mayan, and stars first time actors, it is a tad bit isolating, but the familiarity of the story, coupled with the much needed violence, paints one of the most realistic films since The Passion of the Christ. It is unfortunate that only one man can construct such films, and even more unfortunate is that many people will try and shun this film due to his behavior.Apocalypto was shot entirely on HD, and then blown-up to film, which never takes away from the picture. Gibson's fluid directing is only one piece of this puzzle, along with the costumes, make-up and convincing performances, it is without a doubt that this jungle premised adventure should be a milestone in film. Despite its lack of mainstream appeasement, this film is, at heart, a violent dish of revenge, and its rampages of violent sacrifices and blood are never exaggerated or portrayed without merit. The real honor should be put to the production of this film. The camera glides through the roughest of terrain, rain or shine, without a hint of amateur throughout. Shot in rain forests and jungles throughout central and south America, one cannot tell that this beautiful epic was shot on its high definition format, making Apocalypto the most gorgeously rendered film on the previously mentioned format.This is as intellectual and visual of an experience as it is visceral, and because of this heightens all senses during its two hour -plus stay. Gibson brings something to the screen that is unlike anything brought before, and despite his private life, he should be commended more just this. It is a shame that this artist spends more time in the headlines of the local tabloids, than he does behind the camera. Apocalypto will be a definitely be in a lot of people's top ten this year, not excluding my own.",Apocalypto

The abduction of our hero is stunningly realised, as is the city where he is taken to be sacrificed.However, after that it all goes a bit wrong and the whole thing descends into a scarcely believable chase movie clearly influenced by Richard Donner and other pupils of the mindless, flashy action genre.Overall, a massive disappointment.

In the great tradition of Braveheart and Passion of the Christ, Gibson outdoes himself with Apocalypto and creates a completely believable world during the Mayan times. Watching this movie, I felt like watching a documentary on the people who lived during those times. Whether it is true to the facts doesn't matter anymore.The actor playing Jaguar was brilliant in acting without words (half of the movie doesn't involve dialog), and overall the movie was like an adventure for the movie-goers to experience. There really isn't much plot involved with the movie, but the chase scenes are wonderfully intense and well filmed.

This film solidifies director Mel Gibson's visual flare and ability to transport us to times deep into the past, beyond most people's imagination. However, I had story issues as far as our hero and his journey of survival.I thought the ironies in the film made it too easy for the hero. People (mostly resentful critics) complain that there was a lot left out about the Mayans and their advanced civilization as opposed to the savages they were depicted as in this film. I couldn't care less about that because lots of the savagery in the film was accurate is regard to sacrificing (do the research), and also that stuff has nothing to do with our hero and his survival. The film could've benefited from more complications for the hero, without all the gore and violence. More inner conflicts could've eaten at his heart as he battles against more personal conflicts besides the warriors who wants his head and the survival of his family.Overall, it had me glued to the screen and at the edge of my seat for the whole two hours and twenty minutes. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to identify with the hero, seeing that most films made nowadays about ancient history fail to make an audience care about the characters. That wasn't the case with this film. It was entertaining and the ending was interesting enough for a sequel. Out of four stars (****), I'm stuck between 2 and a half (**1/2) and three stars (***). If you can tolerate lots of gore, violence and close ups of human organs, while reading subtitles then this film is worth checking out.",Apocalypto
264,The_Defiant1,Interesting throughout...,7,10 December 2006,"Lured a bit by the setting, I was open minded and curious. The movie progresses slowly as we get a glimpse of Mayan life in the jungle. We are introduced to the characters and their personalities. As the story unfolds we are subjected to more and more gruesome acts and violence. The movie has more blood and gore than a slasher film. Regardless, it was easy to feel empathy towards the characters. Midway through the movie the story starts to define itself and it becomes easier to get a little excited about what's happening.Be prepared to sit through subtitles. In some places it was hard to keep up with reading the subtitles. None of the plot was lost, but a little of the depth might get lost if you can't keep up.",Apocalypto
265,petsteph1,A great great movie!,9,23 March 2007,"I watched two movies back to back - Apocalypto and 300 - and was totally impressed by Apocalypto and hated 300. That put me at odds with the critics, but then the critics are one man's opinion at best and political creatures at worst and who can really tell the difference? Apocalypto is an adventure story with an upbeat ending. It is much more than that because it includes the toughest woman I've ever seen on a movie and celebrates the endurance and persistence of a human being in a way that moved me to tears. It's not a movie for kids but definitely a movie for adults with a sense of history and a liking for a thrilling ride. I gave it a 9 because absolutes are unobtainable, but Mel Gibson has done us all a service by making it and I thank him for the pleasure of watching it. The story is simple: Mayan culture at its height sends out a team to get new sacrificial victims. They overrun a village and take the men and some of the women. The hero of the story is one of the captives, and he -- well it has an upbeat ending which is perfectly synchronous with everything you are wishing for and hoping for - and fearing in an historical sense. I didn't find a fault with any part of it (unlike the critics who were really just out to bash Mel): the photography and graphics are perfect, the non-star cast is totally convincing,the plot and pacing are always slightly ahead of your anticipation. This is a movie you have to be willing to enjoy, and experience, because it is not simply eye-candy but a statement about the innate wisdom and determination of the individual. See it!",Apocalypto
266,missmarmite,"Very strong cast, but sadly not much of a story",7,9 June 2007,"As soon as Apocalypto was out on DVD I rented it because after having seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ a few weeks ago for Easter on TV I was curious what this film was going to be like. Passion was a disaster of a film, stupid blood shedding and nothing but. No good actors, no story whatsoever, no detectable direction - just hearing spoken Latin in normal dialogues was what made me stay through the film. I was amazed how much I understood when subtitles were missing out on short sentences from time to time. Having learned Latin in school wasn't so bad after all! But the rest of the film was just looking like the extract of a sick mind. Sorry.So, now Apocalypto. After just a few moments I was surprised that it was good what I was watching. It didn't look so much like a feature film but like a documentary. The actors didn't act, they were. Which is a quality in an actor you often don't even find in the great ones. But here, faces you've never seen before, you completely believed every bit of what you saw. Laughter, jokes, bitterness, timidness, joy, everything was the real thing. Normally you get this in European independent films only. But this here was a major production from Hollywood. Or not.Congratulations to all members of the cast, you will hopefully get lots of good parts in the future, especially Rudy Youngblood and Jonathan Brewer. They can show lots of known actors how to act. The supporting cast was great, down to the smallest part. And certainly people from the departments for make-up, hair and costume did an absolutely fantastic and stunning job. I don't say too much in saying you've never seen things like these before in a film like they created.I just wish - and that's why this film gets only seven out of ten points - there would have been a script which had been treated with the same care as everything else. There was almost no story. A man gets separated from his family, is brought to another place, can flee and gets back to his family. Is that really all you can come up with if you think of the Mayas? If you put up such an effort why use such a bleak storyline? This weak story took much of the characters' depth away which is a pity as the actors filled them with so much life. What would they have been able to do if the story had been greater? One can only imagine.I'm curious what Mel Gibson's next film project might be. He doesn't seem to be a bad director. He just shouldn't participate in writing the script, rather concentrate on directing. He could make really good films, I believe. Thrillers, action films, mysterious stuff. Just concentrate on directing. Let somebody write a terrific story and then make a great film out of it! Within those limits... yeah!",Apocalypto

268,yddsp@aol.com,More fiction than fact???,9,28 November 2007,"I posit this commentary without first reading any other reviews on this forum. This is my own perspective from a logical yet visceral level. I have read (at other venues) somewhat derogatory, detracting reviews suggesting an ulterior motive in the vision Mr. Gibson was trying to exhibit and I find all of them less than accurate or even relevant, Me thinks there must have been some hidden agenda, ill will, or perhaps even downright discrimination toward this brilliant, gifted visionary and raconteur.Granted, there are scenes of ultra-graphic violence and gore, but if one must preserve a semblance of honesty without ""sugar-coating"" its subject, this story begged to be told exactly as it was told. How any one of this film's detractors could deign to presume certain events depicted as being overly dramatized for mere shock value and by that being its only goal, is tantamount to the doling out of ""sour grapes"" the way I see it. We all know (vis-a-vis historical documentation) some of the atrocities perpetrated on a people, e.g., our own native American denizens, throughout history, so to postulate as to the extent of the inhumanity in the film's depiction of sacrifices as being more fiction than fact, is to be completely ignorant of historical fact and counter indicative to any and all records discovered and subsequently handed-down through their origins derived from antiquity.This film is a staggering account of man's injustice to man for the sake of some pseudo, hyper-exaggerated ""higher purpose"", and one can see the similitude in correlation with modern-day society's infrastructure. It is a typical ""cat and mouse"" tale of the mundane existence and events which depict, albeit with stark realism, the trials and tribulations of a society on the verge, its struggles and consequently the advent of its eventual demise. Mel Gibson and company did a fine job in the telling of this tale of struggle for survival and all of its woe. It's almost like a character study of sorts only at a more superficial level, but that's alright, you will immediately relate to and sympathize (even empathize) with the main characters and find yourself rooting for the underdog understandably. In many respects, this story poses a sobering, symbolistic parallel to modern-day society's ""middle class"", its inadvertent(?) devaluation, proclivity toward its declination and invariably, its inevitable and ultimate extinction. Excellent job Messrs Mel & company!! 10 of 10",Apocalypto

The lack of a solid story, real drama, however, is taking away a lot of the actual selling-point of this film: the philosophical ideas on the rise and fall of cultures and the underlying reasons for that.
Now it's a lot of action sequences (and by god, they are executed brilliantly) and there is left only a presumption, a glimpse, of the masterpiece it could have been; being a film where superb action-drama would have gone hand in hand with an unusual and daring idea on the necessity of the fall of cultures.Nevertheless.. what a treat!",Apocalypto

274,cardinalbunal,Almost.,10,16 December 2006,"What can I say? Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with furious passion. You may as well call him a madman, because I guess he is... APOCALYPTO exercises the same effusive and perfectly crafted cinematics that we've seen in BRAVEHEART, and moreso in THE PASSION. I was surprised to see it open in a rather comic mood, showcasing the day to day life of the tribe and some hilarious socializing mishaps of one of the characters.As the peril begins, your sympathies are immediately pointed towards Jaguar Paw, who would then run for his life in the chase scene that dominates all towards the end. Rudy Youngblood especially is adept in making his fear contagious, but of course there is his inevitable character arc of resolve and retaliation. Some interesting imagery, from the eclipse, to Mel's trademark POV shots and other beautiful cinematographical treats are instore. I also liked the acting of the pregnant wife's part. Watch out for the surprise in the end....I wished Mel would make more movies like this - at least those that are daring and that defy the Hollywood convention YET maintain the sheer commercial and entertaining value that Hollywood is always supposed to have. You can always reconcile Art and something with Appeal to the masses. The movie's final scene closes with a note of delight and optimism.

275,georgebush,How dare Mel do this.,1,14 December 2006,"How dare Mel Gibson make a movie like this. He has no right to do this. He is insane. Enough is enough. I have had it with Mel Gibson. He should know that the purpose of making films is to promote tolerance. He did not have the required agenda to attack western civilization while pretending that all other civilizations are perfect. Wow. He actually told the truth. How dare he? He has turned his back on socialist film making. This film is about individuality even in tribal cultures. Each person has their own personality and dreams. These people are real and the audience cares about them.These characters are treated as real people and not just an example of some tribe. It is a story of intense survival or death. It is a non stop action film in which we care about he fate of each character including the lead roles. My 12 year old who usually loves Shirley Temple movies really wanted to see it. I let her, although I had her turn her head away about ten times. She loved it and really cared about the people in the film. Even the bad guys had strong personalities, though ruthless. This was not a travel story designed to give us lessons on Mayan and tribal cultures in old Mexico. This was a great story. The Mayans and tribes were back drops to the story. Yes the Mayans were ruthless and cruel. But the Indian tribes the Mayans encountered were portrayed in a very positive way. It was the powerful Mayan tribal civilization against small tribes in the jungle. There is drama there in the powerful against the less powerful. This could have been ancient Rome against smaller societies as in Gladiator or Spartacus. Enslavement, executions and unfairness were seen clearly in this film. This was good against evil. Also the people in this film were also intense serious people in stark contrast to some in our current soft spoiled and judgmental society. Certain people in this film almost felt like family members.The drama and adventure is also great. The graphic violence does not seem gratuitous. It seems relevant and part of the film. In the end it almost felt as if this film was a metaphor for childhood adventure that finally comes to an end at the end but leaves great hope. Any showing of Christianity is vague and distant and the film makes no reference to whether or not it is a good development. Gibson seems neutral and is just showing a new chapter. You will no what i mean if you saw it.I believe the left wing, socialist, communist types hate this film because it portrays tribal people as real people and not just as an oppressed faceless class. It is the socialist left that are the real racists in this country because they see people as part of a group and not as individuals. They condescend and patronize and are total fools. This is a great film that offends only those who live in a silly politically correct world. I hope Gibson makes another film about a family trying to escape from Aztecs who are going to kill and sacrifice a baby. It would not be against Aztecs but only against the powerful in Aztec society who want to harm innocent Aztecs. I hope that the dumb readers can get that. Above all this great film, Apocalypto, is an adventure and a serious human drama. It will also make you feel like a kid again. Gibson you blew it. You did not teach us tolerance and political correctness.",Apocalypto
276,Jakethemuss,Gripping and powerful,8,1 February 2008,"I'm not too sure of the films Gibson stars in, but when hes behind the camera he is very gifted, as Apocalypto proves. Similar to Gibson's previous work, this film is brutal and bloody, with almost every kill showed upfront and direct. So bearing that in mind, if you are not comfy with seeing a Jaguar savage a man's face then perhaps this film is best avoided. If you are okay with blood and violence, then watch on! It is set during the Mayan civilisation in the jungles of Central America. It focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a hunter and family man who like the rest of his tribe, lives in peace and relative safety. The film takes a fairly sharp turn however, when a more developed and much more ruthless tribe pay Jaguar Paw and co and rather unexpected early morning visit, and they're not there on a social call! Without giving too much away, a series of events happens which result in Jaguar desperately running for not just his own life but that of his family. The latter part of the film is effectively a frantic and exciting chase sequence in which the increasingly brilliant Jaguar Paw survives the odds and defies those who wish to bring him down.The camera work itself deserves praise, as the shots do a great job of capturing the essence of the action and combat. Be it slow-mo weapon swings, panicky up close face shots as young Jaguar Paw hurtles through the jungle or wide shots of a cheering crowd baying for blood. It is also clear that a huge amount of effort and research has gone into re-creating the feel of the era; costume, body markings, weaponry, piercings give the film an authentic feel. This is a film that has you captured from very early on, and keeps you watching until the end. A superb spectacle with re watch value.",Apocalypto

It's magical to have a movie that relies so little on dialogue, it could have relied even less.Unfortunately the movie suffers from a few plot and character development gaps that don't allow it to become what it should have been. For instance in the chase during the end, the chasers somehow magically all have torches which A, didn't delay them and we have no idea where they came from, then suddenly it becomes morning, implying the chase lasted all night, yet nobody seems tired.There are characters which are completely left out, for instance the mother in law of one of the guys, we see her being healthy and free, and yet never plays a role in the movie again.The antagonists all seem two dimensional, they only vary by their anger, no sense of feeling or loss, even at a loss of a family member.Similarly for the protagonist, he has a sort of binary character development, fear/not fear, there is no sense of where the development came from, just one moment he is one way, and suddenly he stops, and he is another way.Anyway this movie is surely innovative, it's a great setup, looks cheap to make and is very easy to watch, it just wasn't the best execution.",Apocalypto
279,polar24,"Pleasure for the eyes, but leave your brain at the door.",5,23 January 2007,"Mel Gibson is currently earning a reputation in Hollywood as one of the bad boys. His violent and explicit films aside; despite his outspoken views on society it seems that even bad publicity means big business for him.His latest, Apocalypto, apparently tells the story about the decline of the Mayan kingdom and the struggle for power between the tribes. There are plenty of ferocious native jungles to roam around and some cascading rivers and falls to feast your eyes on. You can smell the dew and rotting of the jungle on the natives over each scene aptly photographed throughout the film.The best part of the film comes from the make-up splattered on the villagers and their various face-paint and head masks. They are inventive shocking, and barbaric and it is a great pleasure to be in the company of many authentic Mexicans who inhabit their ancestral roles and give full credit to their adorning garments. In fact I couldn't have imagined the film without authentic country men and women playing these roles.But I had some huge problems with the film. I was expecting to learn a little more about this ancient kingdom, the people, their culture and customs. In the end all I got was a bunch of bloodied Indians, as a result I didn't care much for them or their exotic villages. You never really get to hear any of them speak except to rant out trite American musings such as ""I am the warrior, Hear me roar!"" or ""I WILL avenge my father"" which as far as film dialogue goes is accustomed more to Star Wars action movies.In addition, the film is heavily gory and violent. So much, so that it becomes ridiculous, unbelievable and gratuitous. It seems liked Mel just wanted to ""shock"" the audience as much as possible and each time, there was no substance, subtlety or meaning in the violence. From the screams and squirms within in the audience it sounded as if they had also had enough. In the end, I felt like he just exploited the Mayan people just to show us more gore and blood only to satisfy action movie devotees. It would have been nice to know more about these mysterious and exotic people and allow for even a meager amount of character development.Gibson's direction was adequate and at times he does some nice things playing with the sunlight and the jungle, however for the most part it was mediocre, predictable and superfluous. He should have done much better considering the story he had to work with. I was nauseous from this tasteless and superficial action-movie by the end.From Mad Max to Lethal Weapon, Braveheart to The Passion of the Christ; Gibson is increasingly becoming more explicit and violent in his take on important cultures and people. If only he took the time to listen to these people's stories instead of simplifying everything to blood and gore it would make a much more stimulating film.",Apocalypto
280,Solipsisticblog,Brutal adventure tale is one of the year's best films,10,11 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's cautionary tale cum action flick is an unrelentingly violent, mesmerizing achievement. Yes, Gibson's drunken hateful remarks and arrest for DUI were events deserving of scorn, but this movie should be viewed on its own merits. Gibson doesn't entirely succeed on selling the message of the movie--when a society begins to exploit others and the environment it is planting the seeds of its destruction--but as an adventure story, it is among cinema's best.The film succeeds wildly in transporting us to a different world. It tells the story of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his nightmarish journey back home after being captured by vicious Mayan raiders. Given how alien so much of the environment and customs seem, the use of the Yucatec language, and the magnificent, terrifying Mayan city, the film plays more like a sci-fi or fantasy film than period piece. There is nothing stiff about this dip into history. (There is some heated dispute among scholars and peoples of the Yucatan as to the film's accuracy.) Some will balk at the film's violence and understandably so. This is the most brutal movie to play in shopping malls since ""Saving Private Ryan."" (This movie is yet another recent example of a violent movie that deserves an NC-17.) Is it too much? I will leave it to you decide, but I do think Gibson uses the violence well. It raises the stakes of Jaguar Paw's struggle. He is caught in a brutal conflict with high stakes. The steady display of viscera adds realism and terror. This makes us acutely aware of the horror and impending doom.SPOILERS The first two thirds of the movie are fascinating and gripping. Gibson transports us completely to another world and then establishes a growing and oppressive sense of doom as Jaguar Paw's world is progressively shattered by the Mayan raiders. The second act of the movie is its most thrilling as Jaguar Paw becomes a participant in horrifying religious rituals and then seizes on an opportunity for escape. The third act is the film's most conventional as Jaguar Paw becomes the hunter. This film features a baptism scene much like ""The Descent"" and ""Predator"" when the prey emerges from a baptism of grime to become the hunter. This final third is good fun, but it finally shows us Gibson's hand. He's more interested in presenting a thrilling tale than making a profound statement. SPOILERS END So be it. I haven't seen all this year's Oscar hopefuls, but its not likely that any other film this year will be such a confident display of a director at the top of his craft. This film is drawing some negative reviews, but most of these reviews are largely focused on Gibson the man and not Gibson the director. I think the two can be separated--I still go see Roman Polanski movies. Film lovers will not want to miss this mesmerizing, brutal adventure tale. If this film was created by a director with little to no name recognition, it would be heralded by critics around the world as a masterful achievement.",Apocalypto

You see how people of that time lived, loved, joked, hunted, related, and died. You are taken along for their hunts, their fights and even to an Mayan temple for sacrifices in a scene that can only be described as mind-blowing! I cannot stress how well-done this film was. I felt like a kid again watching this film, because it has such an escapist feel to it. Yes, it is violent, so was the world, in particular, Mayan society at that time.

But the violence is necessary time, place,and plot wise.* The story involves a Mayan raid to obtain slaves for human sacrifice. The first third of the film portrayed the violence, pain and suffering inherent in a slave trade. As one of European descent I sat there wondering How can these Mayans be so barbaric and cruel to each other. Then I remembered that Europeans were just as cruel during the African slave trade, the conquest of the Americas, Nazi Germany, and many other times.I enjoyed the middle third, in the Mayan city. I am a big fan of the crowds, costumes, hair do's, dances and other pageantry.**** I felt that the ending was a cop out. Having the European ships show up and overawe the hero's final two pursuers. I suppose there was a time crunch - our hero's having to kill three pursuers in time to rescue his wife and son from drowning in a well like pit during a rain storm. Reducing the pursuers to two or one and having the hero defeat them would have been much more satisfying than the ending used.This movie showed both the dark side and the light side of Mayan civilization - great cruelty but also great humanity and courage.",Apocalypto
284,pogostiks,adolescent but gorgeous,6,10 October 2007,"I wouldn't call Mel Gibson intelligent, but he is certainly crafty. He knows how to make films that will sell well. He gets every Christian imaginable to come to see his Passion of the Christ - and even gets the Jews to come to see whether it is as anti-Semitic as some have said. Here, in Apocalypto, Gibson has decided to make a film which will appeal to that most important of demographics - the teenage male. As such, it needs two basic things. A juvenile attraction to everything sexual - especially the male genitalia - and, of course, violence and gore.Something else about the film - which could also be said about the Passion of the Christ - is that it is highly homo-erotic. Underneath all his machismo, I wonder if Gibson even realizes this fact. The main leads are, almost to a man, stunningly gorgeous and sensual. And of course, given the fact that they are almost completely nude makes this film a gay man's dream come true.That said, I think that the film has to be divided into two parts. First comes the peaceful everyday life of the Mayan villagers - which I must say came across to me as so completely juvenile in its attempt at humour that I wonder how Gibson can hold his head up in public, never mind be a father to children. Eating tapir testicles, making jokes about a man's concerns about not being able to father children - and giving the same man a supposed cream to help him which in fact burns his genitals (and his wife's mouth)...get it? har har...)is adolescent in the extreme. The second part is made up principally of blood and gore, as people are sacrificed with their hearts ripped out, their heads severed - and during a chase scene just about every manner imaginable is used to kill the trackers of our hero. So - sex , blood and gore. What more do you need to get those young kids to come into the theatre?I have given this film a vote of 6 out of 10. If I am less than happy with the facilities of the script, I have to admit two basic things about Apocalypto in general. It is cinematographically gorgeous... it is a visual cornucopia that fascinates from beginning to end. Secondly, it has some of the most striking make-up and costumes to have ever been put on film; head-dresses, tattoos, body ""armour"" and jewellery, piercings, hairstyles - the imaginative delights never seem to stop. To hell with the story - I could watch those beautiful and expressive faces and body trappings for hours and never be bored.So the film gets a six - for the visuals despite the pathological subtext.",Apocalypto

This Apocalypto thing however isn't nothing of the sort, and at the end of the movie we can't even understand why it is named Apocalypto.It fails to teach us anything other than there was violence in an ancient civilization; it tries to portray one of the most advanced civilizations in its time as just barbaric and sadistic; it fails to explain to us why things happened the way it did; and last but not the least the myriad of secondary stories are left incomplete and it is our job to figure it out (if we bother).This was a missed opportunity to make something about a rich civilization that deserved to be portrayed in all its magnificence... As it is, this movie could have been done about any other civilization in the world as it just portrays the worst aspect of them all - violence.Violence for the sake of violence doesn't make a good story let alone a good movie about it. This is definitely not worth watching; just a waste of time...",Apocalypto
286,david-2829,"Bad-ass! There's simply no better word to describe this heart-pounding, gruesome action adventure.",9,29 December 2010,"Rarely have I felt such fear and menace from a ""bad guy"" and conversely had such hope for the hero.Mel Gibson has a flair for battle, whether he's in front of the lens or behind it. I don't like his personal views and actions, but it's hard to deny that Apocalypto is a masterpiece of cinema. It has such realism all the way through, from the casting of mostly unknown actors to the on-location sets to the hard core tribal warfare.One of the most riveting scenes at the center of the movie is the sacrificial dais, and the sweeping panorama of what seems like a sea of people. Truly remarkable and overwhelming.This is definitely a man's movie, hitting that same nerve as other testosterone-filled flicks like 300, Braveheart, Terminator 2. But an action movie doesn't hold my interest unless it is backed up by a good story and most of all believability. Nobody wants to see a wimpy villain or a pushover hero... and I hate it when all looks lost until some ""magic button"" emotion turns on in the hero. (You know exactly what I'm talking about). The good news - Apocalypto rises to all these challenges and delivers the goods on every point. Don't miss it!",Apocalypto
287,GSmith9072,To love or not to love,7,18 December 2006,"Apocalypto thrives on its' original premise; it uses a subject that has never been so thoughtfully transferred to a riveting adventure flick on the big screen. During the decline of a Mayan Kingdom, ritual sacrifices are carried out in an attempt of appeasing the gods. The whole thing obviously isn't a pretty picture. The film even opens with the graphic evisceration of a tapir, and that's scene that leads to the only comic relief in the entire film. From the start you know what you are in for. There are a few things that people may choose to condemn the film for. The problem lies in the fact that a prominent civilization is possibly being imposed upon mainly for ritual sacrifices that may or may not have occurred. Being the first film of its' kind, is it fair for the film to emphasize the violence to this degree? Graphic violence is many times necessary for realism in movies, but sometimes the violence got a little over the top and bordered on exploitation. In addition, the story is overtly simplistic and a tad predictable. With that being said, should it really matter? It is important to put this film in the genre of ""chase movie"", and with that it succeeds brilliantly. The set designs and well-researched Mayan attire are nothing short of awe-inspiring. The same goes for the spectacular cinematography. The film has emerged from a director who severely knows the camera. If you look past the blood (and there is a lot), the film is also exceedingly beautiful. The natural images intertwined with the beautiful set designs created some staggering imagery. The conclusion was adequate and made for a powerful and expressive scene. And so I must conclude that in this sense the film works in an unconventional kind of way. It is marvelous to look at (for those with strong stomachs any way) and it a stunning accomplishment in film-making techniques. The deciding factor on whether one enjoys the film will depend on one's expectations of the film or how in depth one feels it should go in the exploration of the culture. It's a love it or hate it movie that's hard to disregard.",Apocalypto
288,dtrani,Excellent! Raw-feeling!,9,2 September 2020,"Mel Gibson and his team outdid themselves here. It seems that no matter what he is looking to tell (faith-based film, historical film, etc.), he always knows exactly how to tell the story in a real way. He is known for not sugar-coating anything in his movies and this film has many jaw-dropping moments.
Aside from how raw and graphic it can be, the film gives you a great sense of how it might have been in that time period and brings the environment to life. Although the overall outline of the film is very simple, Mel Gibson makes every shot, scene and setting engaging and worth while.
Although the cinematography from The Passion of the Christ (Gibson's previous film) had many more ""wow"" moments, Apocalypto is not far from it. The only real problem I found in it, was how each shot sometimes had a different shutter speed (meaning that some shots had soft movements and some shots look more choppy). I really enjoyed the choppy look many of the shots had but was always taken out when I saw a super soft-looking shot. This could easily be of preference to the filmmakers but I didn't like it personally. But of course, this isn't nearly as bothersome to crush this film.Mel Gibson is one of those directors that could care less about what you think about his film. I admire the fact that when he makes a film, he makes it in the way he feels fit, and not whether the audience would like it or not. I respect this film a lot and never found a dull moment. Exhilarating and amazing!",Apocalypto
289,Macabro,Simply Brilliant Mel Gibson should now try doing a horror film,10,3 October 2007,"Apocalypto is one of those films that captures the audience since the very first minutes of the film. It is a great story taken to the screen from the mind of a revolutionary director. Mel Gibson captured the essence of the Maya Civilization, the language, the costumes it gave a different perspective of what the Mayas were and that there were others in the jungle that did not follow or believe the Maya beliefs. Personally, I found this gratifying and open minded since I never really thought about it. As passionate as I am about ancient civilizations, the focus always is in their religion and culture and not so much in their surroundings.Anyhow, everything in Apocalypto was done masterfully. It is clear that the people involved in this film spent lots of time researching the Mayas to make this epic film. As it is also clear that Gibson, is not afraid to show blood and violence in his movies. We have seen it in Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ and now Apocalypto. What's next? I think he should definitely make a horror film since he clearly has a taste for showing blood and difficult situations in his films and succeeds at it... transmitting his vision no matter what.",Apocalypto
290,mitchryder1953,Historically incorrect,8,27 September 2021,I think it supposed to be the Aztecs not the Mayans. Mayans were long gone before the Europeans came to America. Mayans civilization ended around 900 A. D. Long before the Europeans came.,Apocalypto
291,carolethecatlover,"So different, yet so human, could be science fiction.",10,23 January 2007,"It is rare to see such a different story, so far off to the left field, that it leaves you stunned. But on reflection, it is a regular story, with a reluctant hero, propelled into an adventure he does not want, forced to travel, it has chase scenes, a love interest, shapeshifters, but this is different, unexpected, violent (but a car wreck, a staple of modern films, is violent, and much more likely to kill you than an arrow.) This is a film about a time and place so far from us that it might happen on another planet. The speed, the forest is so cunningly filmed that you feel that you are there in the humid canopy, the smell of the green and the fear that follows you.....human. Quite frankly, this is one of the most original films I have seen in years, (Orlando was the last I would so categorize) It belongs to no genre. Much has been said that it is in an unknown language with subtitles. This has no relevance. It could have been a speech free film and I would have still felt the emotions and the fear. Makes Alien a movie for wimps! One of the best this year.",Apocalypto
292,lucasaq-1,A bloody no-holds-bar thriller.,8,22 January 2007,"Last year Terrence Malick's ""The New World"" integrated the sounds of the jungle into the film with amazing cinematography, Mel Gibson has taken it a step further and created a thriller around the jungle. While The New World went on far too long and wandered, Gibson has kept this film a trim two hours, and a little more and has the story to sustain. But this is where the comparison ends because Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is a completely different animal than Malick's tame New World. As I said, ""Apocalypto"" is a thriller and it is a bloody no-holds-bar thriller. With not a single actor you will recognize, Gibson manages to flesh out characters and setup a gripping story.The film begins with a boar bolting out of the brush that the film had zoomed in on where before was only the still stir of the busy jungle, now there is intense noise as the boar crashes through the jungle. As we soon discover, this is a hunt and the boar never really stands a chance as it is herded in the direction the hunters wanted and skewered on stick of spikes. And make no mistake it doesn't imply that it gets hit it shows it get hit. This is the first show of bloody violence, but far from the last and far from the most graphic. From there we are introduced to the hunters who are lead by Jaguar Paw and his father. Jaguar divides up the boar's vitals to each member of the gang before giving the testicles to one of the biggest of the group. It is then that we discover that they practice some sort of fertility ritual and they goad him into eating it because he can't get his wife pregnant. It is quite disgusting really to watch him take the first bite, but it quickly changes when the hunters bust up laughing. It is then that we discover that it was an elaborate joke. They don't do anything like that. This is the first of two major jokes to the related subject which loose up the audience before turning deadly serious. I thought it was a brilliant stroke to have so moments to ease the tension.The gist of the story is that a small village, Jaguar Paw's village is attacked and savaged by Mayan invaders who take them captive. That is except for Jaguar Paw's wife and son whom he managed to save in pit. They are then marched off to the Mayan city where they are to be sacrificed. While I do not want to ruin what happens after that, I will suffice to say that it is one man's struggle to be reunited with his family and calm his own fear which is instilled at the beginning.The film is tightly focused with the middle being the only slightly straying part as we are introduced to the Mayan society, based around bloody sacrifices. I felt it attempted to capture too much of this blood shedding. Gibson features multiple body dismemberment during this sequence. But that is a minor quibble with this otherwise very intense film which really never slows down from the boar's abrupt appearance until the ending shot.Gibson's vision is unrelenting but justified in the context and it is filmed exquisitely in the jungles. Gibson's recreation of the Mayan society is a thing to behold although not for the weak of stomach. My stomach still hasn't settled since I left the theater. The most intense experience I have had a theater in a long time. Maybe not one of my favorites of the year, but I don't deny the quality.",Apocalypto
293,blubb06,An essential antidote to 'feel good'-history,9,26 August 2007,"Mel Gibson has been called an Anglophobic (""Braveheart""), anti-Semite (""The Passion"") and racist (after this one), besides ""a disgrace to the United States"" (where he was born). He's the son of a so-called Holocaust denier and a devout Catholic who has allegedly expressed views that his film-making is partly directed by God. According to Wikipedia, he is also a known prankster who likes to gift-wrap a dead rat.All of the above serve to illuminate why his movies are so controversial - and watchable. It takes a rebel to make those films. And a good director with a self-serving, uncompromising moral view to counter the politically-correct, but nevertheless slanted whitewash - by omission - we usually see. I didn't like ""Braveheart"" (for artistic reasons), but I'd want him to make a film about the Spanish Inquisition or a remake of ""1492"" (to be prepared, read ""Lies my Teacher told me"" by James W. Loewen).""Apocalypto"" is another mythical-historic epic about basic good and evil where the innocent get drenched in blood. All of Gibson's films have been criticized for historical inaccuracies, always with political overtones. But yes, the English did rule Ireland and Scotland with an iron fist for hundreds of years, both Jews and Romans wanted Jesus gone (or so I was taught in school), and human sacrifice was indeed practiced widely in South- and Mesoamerica by Incas (Mexica) and Aztecs, as numerous archaeological findings show ... I wouldn't pin it especially on the Maya.The spoken Mayan language (Yucatec), the actors and the incredible detail is what gives ""Apocalypto"" its air of authenticity and positively distinguishes it from ""Hollywood"" cinema in the bad sense, where foreigners still speak in broken English rather than in subtitles. The story is less complex than it sounds: Jaguar Paw, a forest hunter and his entire tribe are enslaved by a band of fearsome warriors. The women are sold as slaves while the men are destined to be sacrificed to the god Kukulkan in order to make the land fertile again and defeat the terrible plague that ravages these people - or if you prefer, because they've developed the habit. On their way they meet an infected child that prophesies the following: the sun will disappear, all warriors will be killed by 'a man who runs with the jaguar', and ultimately their whole civilization will fall... well, I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't read a history book lately.The violence and gore are not simply ""sensationalistic"", but essential to the story. Those people believed in blood as the essence of fertility. I recommend the BBC's ""Ancient Apocalypse"" or ""Blood and flowers: In search of the Aztecs"" as entertaining background info; drought was a problem in food-cultivation and may even have led to the Maya Collapse, hundreds of years before the Spaniards arrived. The blood-letting of the band leader and the reckless way the fictional Maya behave towards their own lives is also concurrent with the alleged Maya belief that life was just a dream. They were renowned as great lovers of poetry - or so we're told.Revulsion towards their savage sacrificial practices today is exactly what the ancient Europeans must have felt. It gave them a good reason (and native support) to mount the moral high horse and exterminate or enslave most natives within 50 years, another rich field of sorrow that has never been explored by a major movie (""1492"" is hero worship and a whitewash of Columbus). I'm rather glad that Gibson precluded all comparison by omitting the Conquista - this is a native story with native characters and themes.A definite must-see and talk-about!",Apocalypto
294,dcorr123,A visually stunning picture of the Mayan world,9,15 December 2006,"I divide this movie into three segments. The first presents a vivid picture of ordinary pre-conquest Maya. Although it's relatively short, it packs quite lot of, surprisingly accurate, *information* on their culture in that time; much more accurately than 13th century Scotland is presented in Braveheart! The society and the individuals presented are believable and engaging. The second segment we are now exposed to a much less engaging aspect of Mayan culture. It provides, never-the-less, in my opinion, some of the most stunning visuals in the history of motion pictures. In doing so, it also continues the presentation of a lot of cultural *information*. The scale of sacrifice looks more Aztec than Mayan though and I would expect the use of cenotes (limestone sink-holes) for disposing of bodies).The third segment replaces that fascinating, surreal and horrifying world with a heart pounding, non-stop chase, recalling Cornell Wilde's *The Naked Run*. While I also like that movie, and the pursuit is almost the whole movie, I tend to agree with those, that the chase (in Apocalypto) could have been shorter and was, at times, a bit unbelievable. Nothing individually that couldn't happen, but Of course, like so many movies, what we are presented with is a skewed view of a culture. In reality, most days of, probably most whole years of, an average Maya's life would have been like that presented in the first half hour. Movies that concentrate on the day-to-day doings of a society, e.g. farming, don't generally play too well, although I would recommend *Hadaka no shima* to anyone. Regarding the arrival of the Spanish, some reviewers are stating that is erroneous history, that the Mayan civilization came to and end centuries before. That is incorrect. Only the Southern Lowland centers of the so-called *Classic* era collapsed. Highland Maya and Northern Lowland centers continued to flourish in the *Post-Classic* era until and after the arrival of the Spanish. The Spanish, under Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba, first contacted the Maya in Yucatan in 1517. Their description of a Maya city that they dubbed El Gran Cairo, led to Cortez's expedition of 1519 that eventually conquered the Aztecs, although his first landing was in Tabasco where he fought an indecisive battle with the Chontal Maya. The last Maya kingdom to be conquered, the Itza in northern Guatemala, fell in 1697, 180 years later!Regarding the little girl's rash: I'm of the impression that is supposed to be smallpox, which would be appropriate with both her predictions and the movie's ending, however it actually looks a lot more like leprosy. The pustules formed by smallpox are smaller, rounder and much more abundant.",Apocalypto
295,oaksong,Go Tarzan....at least there was a monkey,6,10 December 2006,"Having watched quite a few Johnny Weismuller Tarzan films in my early years, I have to say this beats the heck out of them. It's got phenomenal color and beautiful jungle locations, and that's about the extent of the veracity, after you get past the original village scenes. The only thing missing was our hero swinging from vines from tree to tree.Makeup was superb, the costumes were excellent, the acting was really quite good for a B movie, but, in the end, that's what it is, a glorified, over-the-top B movie. It would have been a double feature back in the day.Is it tremendously entertaining? You betcha! Is it anywhere near Oscar worthy? Not a chance. Should it be seen on the big screen? Absolutely! The special affects are quite seamless and the camera work is truly amazing. It's a shame that there's no story, at least not one that's particularly compelling. It's got all the oomph of the ball rolling after Indiana Jones, on and on and on...and that's pretty much the story line.So, if you're looking for a Saturday afternoon film that will get your Adrenalin pumping, I can highly recommend it, but even Pirates of the Caribean has more complexity in its story line.Cheers.",Apocalypto
296,JolinKnight,That's Mayan!,8,26 September 2013,"I'm lazy and easily forgetting things. So coincidently I never checked the exact year of Mayan civilization. Initially I thought Mayan should be a civilization before Rome or something earlier than that. When I saw the expedition heading to the land, I was thinking you must be kidding, as the earliest continents exploring is in around 15th or 16th centre I can't remember. But I want to say here is how can Mayan civilization still there in the 15th centre. What a careless director, not even check book, at least wikipedia can save your pride. Then you know I did checked Wiki and it was close that I make any review about this. If I did that's really shamed.About the movie, it uses Mayan language through the whole movie. That is amazing, because I was doubting the Mayan language has already extinguished early ago. It's really cool when seeing them hunting. They move fast, never get tired, no protection like shoes or close for running in the forest. They are really good at playing cold weapons. Many times the fighting and preying make me exited. The only thing shocked me is the killing, balling the human heads from the tall building, that's really suck. I can't help myself to swear, how stupid it is. Here I finally knew why Mayan vanished, it's really stupid...... What they did is obey ethic and the natural regulation, so that's the reason. Also I likely saw some idea about criticising on the western expedition, the movie wants to express that the western civilization is as same as Mayan. For example, Mayans prey the other tribes and slaughter them. However the European are exactly same, as they came to South American leading to the final vanishing of Mayan. So what I say is this movie asks us to preserve the culture diversity, at present, it's the thing.In conclusion, a good movie, nothing boring, nothing get it down, hope you guys enjoy.",Apocalypto
297,StrayFeral,Portrait of an ancient world,10,18 December 2006,"First of all I need to point out - the teaser was misleading, the trailer also does not really leads the viewer to what this movie is about. The poster does not help either. My impression was, this movie is some sci-fi/fantasy about Maya, probably something not close, but similar to ""Stargate"". The poster even made me think of ""Alien vs. Predator"".Well, wrong. The movie is portraying the ancient world of Mesoamerican people, as well as tracking the end of the ancient civilizations, through the story of Jaguar's Paw - a captured warrior in a rescue to his family.Few things to point out about this movie: -This is action story narrated in good way -Very good music -Very good photography -Wonderful recreation of the ancient life -Not so bloody as described, but not for kids Now few details.Note: Previously, about this movie I wrote ""Not historically precise"", but now take my words back, since I learned, that both Mayas, Aztecs and Incas were conquered by the Spanish conquistadors. First of all, regardless of what the trailer make you think of, this is a pure action movie. The story is mostly around the main character, than around the Mayas themselves. What about the Mayas? Gibson did great job of showing spectacular images of ancient life. Especially the human sacrifice. The humor was very good too. But I was disappointed, since expected to see more of the cultural and probably spiritual life of these people. One impression I got is Gibson was inspired in some way by ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" (1991) or similar movie. My opinion anyway.I have just deleted big passages of my previous posting, since the movie's historical precision is kinda questionable, so better just sit back and enjoy the movie.Something I hardly could not notice, was Gibson was inspired by ""Dune"" (1984). Why? There is a moment in ""Apocalypto"", where a little girl is saying a prophecy, just and exactly like Alia in ""Dune"". Even the camera angle and girl's look were the same. Since I do not want my review to contain spoilers, would just say that what Gibson showed, applies in my opinion, half to Amazon tribes, half to Aztecs. I know, most people do not care, so I say:-Go see the movie, it's a good one.",Apocalypto
298,Clothes-Off,Enough gore to please the most ardent slasher-movie fans.,3,12 June 2007,"It was very difficult for me to sit through the entire film, but when I give a film a shot, I stick with it unless it is terminally boring--which this one wasn't (hence the 4/10 rating). The acting was solid, as was the cinematography.That's it for the positives.Other than that, this film reminded me of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World in that its positives didn't make up for its weaknesses by any stretch. But where MaC:TFSotW was simply dull and overly long, this film is a downright turnoff.Some may say the ultraviolent imagery was performed in the name of ""realism"" but to me the purpose seemed more titillation, and gratuitous at that. Beyond this, it seems to lack any message despite a quote at the beginning which falsely suggests a theme might emerge in the film.I was just about done with Gibson, but I agreed to watch this with someone else and kept an open mind. Why he feels the need to consistently put such carnage on display I don't know; but this time I'm done for sure.",Apocalypto
299,Rick NYC-2,A Brilliant Message About Civilization,10,8 December 2006,"Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but he knows how to make an authentically real statement about the human condition. The movie is about civilization and how smaller is better. There are some rain-forest dwelling American natives, somewhere in America where there are jaguars and monkeys. Then there are some ""civilized"" natives, with a huge society of nobles, serfs, slaves and sacrificial victims who get their hearts torn out and heads chopped off on top of a pyramid, for the appeasement of their gods and for the sake of controlling and entertaining the ""citizens."" Our noble small villagers of the forest are ultimately hunted down and enslaved by the more organized, and totally vicious, pyramid builders. This is a story of how one of these villagers deals with the horrific trials that his captors heap upon him. The whole movie is in an ancient native language, subtitled in English, and it lends an air of excruciating authenticity to the happenings. One gets the feeling of being a time traveler, as this 500-year-old world seems so real, with every detail of weaponry, cookware, clothing, jewelry, labor practices, buildings, village characters, and sacrificial ceremonies so obviously researched that it made me feel uncomfortably like I was involved in it all. We are constantly getting the crowd's point of view of all the empire's activities and abuse of its captives and underlings. There is a lot to look at here, from God's beautiful nature to man's nightmarish creations, so it deserves to be seen on a big screen.",Apocalypto

The acting is outstanding esp from the young lead actor and the relentless leader of the men who attacked his village.
THis is a visually stunning movie ( on many occassions my mouth was open in awe). i have no idea of the historical or anthroplogical accuracy. For me, at least, the whole effect was a riveting the runtime seemed to fly, there were no points where the narrative lagged,no scene was superfluous. the scene where the captives enter the temple complex was both stunning and terrifying to watch. another scene about 3 mins from the end when 3 men are standing in the rain brought tears to my eyes because it referenced a pivitol point in the history of the Americas that lead to an orgy of inhumane violence far in excess of anything the Mayans had experienced.watch this movie, give it your full attention , yes it is bloody but not excessively or gratuitously, it is essential to the story.",Apocalypto

Personally, not a fan of Mel Gibson but he really knows how to hire the right people to create his vision and that is admirable. One of the beautiful scenes in any movie is when they enter the Azteca City and the colors of greens & blues. The Aztec king and his wives were just fantastic. Simple gorgeous! I remember seeing the making of and Mel hired a team Mexican Historian women Artists who recreated much of the set designs & costumes.",Apocalypto
302,secretagent_007,A Welcome Apocalypse,8,25 January 2008,"I must say that this movie looks AMAZING in HD. I rented the Blu-Ray disc from Netflix and my TV became a window into the past (even though three pixels are dead and Sharp refuses to exchange it for a screen w/o flaws). The details of the jungle are incredible and the colors, from blue skies and bloody reds, are so vivid you might as well be there. If you haven't yet picked up an HDTV, I recommend you do so. Moving on Apocalypto is Mel Gibson's follow-up to The Passion of the Christ and a return to form for him. I've really liked his direction in the past, but his work on Passion came off like the world's most expensive experimental film. I've seen other movies with Biblical origins and liked them, but that one truly rubbed me the wrong way. (And let's not get into the alleged anti-Semitism that later seemed to be confirmed by his infamous drunken rant against Jews.) Much like Passion, this movie is filmed entirely in a foreign language which gives the film great authenticity. A movie like Troy may be an epic adventure movie, but a cast speaking English reveals it to be a silly costume drama. Through the dialogue, the costumes, the set design, the real jungle, and a surprising amount of hand-held camera work, the drama has a documentary feel to it, like we're seeing things through a time machine.It's an action movie at its core, a genre in which Mel has some expertise - from Mad Max to The Patriot. The fight scenes are well-constructed and intense (meaning gory as what all), the chase sequences are swift and breathtaking (if a bit long), and the characters are well drawn and memorable. Gibson has not ignored subtext in his film though, like many action epics are wont to do. The film begins with the massacre of a village by royal warriors who have come to take slaves (or sacrifices). Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) manages to save his pregnant wife and son by hiding them in a well before he is captured and marched away to have his heart cut out and head lopped off. As he is led away he must figure out how to get back to his family and save them from the well which could (meaning it definitely will) fill up with rainwater. But that's not all, folks! Gibson also intends this portrait of Mayan life to represent the end of that great civilization. There's a scene where Jaguar Paw, fleeing his enemies, reaches the ocean and can go no further. The ones hunting him catch up and also stop - several European ships are just offshore and Spaniards are headed for land. From earlier scenes, we've learned that this was a culture plagues by failing crops, rampant disease, a violent and corrupt government, and a populace that craved public sacrifices to satisfy the Mayan gods that caused all this mayhem. According to this film, it was all falling apart already, the Conquistadors were just a final blow to put the Mayans out of their misery. The message calls for us to return to a simpler, more peaceful state. Kind of a funny thing to find in a movie with so many seriously gruesome deaths. Whatever Mel Gibson has done to earn my ire in the past, he's redeemed himself with this movie. Not only is it very entertaining on a basic level, there's enough going on beneath that to make one consider its implications. We want you back, Mel!http://www.movieswithmark.com",Apocalypto
303,bLuR-7,A brilliant spectacle,10,17 October 2007,"In recent years, a plethora of screen actors have managed to successfully make the transition to becoming film directors, often choosing politically-charged message films to help them cement their status as truly respected 'cinema artistes'. However, as far as controversies go, none of these new directors could possibly hold a candle to the contentiousness surrounding the works of Mel Gibson. His Oscar-winning turn as actor/director in 1995's Braveheart prove that despite the 'vanity project' feel of his film, he was a formidable filmmaker who had more than proved his mettle. Nearly a decade later, he gave us a film that was drenched in enough of his obsessive fervour to rival the torrents of blood on screen - The Passion of the Christ. Criticised for its anti-Semitic tinge, relentless gore and sheer sensationalism, Passion surpassed all expectations to become the highest grossing R-rated film (as well as the highest grossing subtitled film) in US box office history, certainly no mean feat.Undeterred by his critics, Gibson went on to direct another subtitled film (proving that he was unmindful of his films' box office potential) about the decline of the Mayan empire. Just like his previous works, Apocalypto was an exercise in bloodletting, often juxtaposing unflinchingly violent sequences with scenes of exceptionally beautiful catharsis. The crisp digital video services the film well, creating a sense of stark realism that's befitting for a film set in the lush rainforests of pre-Columbian Central America. The film also creates a sense of vicarious thrill by using sharp editing to create some truly exhilarating foot-chases.The one thing that flaws Apocalypto in the end is its desire to overachieve. Its heedless ambition far exceeds its reach, and in the end the film is nothing more than one man's account of his pursuit to reach his family. It fails to analyse the reasons involved behind the fall of the empire, a topic it tauntingly hints at with the citation it quotes just prior to the opening credits. Still, Apocalypto manages to give us a fascinating look inside a civilisation now lost to the ravages of time, conquerors and self-destructive abandon.

304,atliel,Decay of our civilization,8,16 December 2006,"The film itself is a simple exercise in the ""hero's journey"" type of story-telling where the main character doesn't really transform in any way meaningful from start to finish. In other words his goal is to survive and rescue his family but in the end his character isn't any different from the one we witnessed at the start of the film. Instead the journey allows us to witness the transformation of a society. We go from humble village to a horrifying city but both belong to the same group of people, the Mayans. There was a saying (I'm para-phrasing) that all good things from the country end up in the city. But if that's the case here and if the city is a reflection of the kind of people that live in it then the Mayans as a people are coming to an end.It goes without saying that most people will rate this film based on Mel Gibson's performance as a person rather than as an artist. In that case it's unfair in that it is possible to separate the two, one's personal life and their work. However, Mel Gibson is really trying to make a critical commentary about our own civilization crumbling by focusing on an ancient one as an example. This is where I can agree with most people about their feelings toward Mel. If he wants to lecture people about the decay of our society he needs to work on his own problems first, otherwise, he comes off as hypocritical. Regardless, as annoying as it is to agree with him, he still makes a good point and he does it by making a historical piece relevant to today's world.The point is I enjoyed the film because it is a good story; it's beautifully shot, well acted, and yes well directed. As a matter of fact when we arrive at the Mayan city you can't help but feel astounded at the detail of the production design that went into constructing what ultimately turns out to be a nightmare of a city. Unfortunately, we all know this film would have gotten better treatment had it been made by someone else. I don't know who gets screwed over more, Mel Gibson's wallet or people whose minds were made up before seeing the film and even worse those, who refuse to see it because of Mel.",Apocalypto
305,zaisjr,Absolutely amazing!!!,9,21 January 2010,"I didn't see this movie in the theater because people told me it was full of gore and horrific violence. I have been studying the Mayans for years, even went to Central America and hung out with present day Mayans. So I was afraid that this movie would corrupt all that we know about the Mayans. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised when I rented the movie.I won't spoil anything for you. This movie did an awesome job of playing on the stereotypes and misconceptions of the Mayan people. The beginning hunt was a prime example. Surprisingly, Mel did a good job of depicting the Mayans, their customs, their history, and their struggles.This movie showed us once again that Mel Gibson knows plot structure better than anyone. Once again Mel has presented us with strong characters. It's one of those movies where you root for the good guys and keep hoping the bad guys get what they deserve. This movie has some of the best antagonists I've seen in a movie recently. It's easy to see that this movie was carefully made and well thought out.If you're sick of the crap that Hollywood puts out consistently, then you'll find this movie refreshing. Sure, it is violent. But not any more violent than any other violent movie. Enjoy!",Apocalypto
306,lambchopnixon,"Penis jokes, skulls crushed.",1,14 June 2010,"A film of a primitive jungle tribe that is attacked and enslaved, which one escapes from, to get back to woman and child left in a safe place. There you have it, the entire plot, a framework which begins with genital joke after genital joke to show us their lives. It begins as nothing more than a normal, bad and crudely written jock-flick, with dumb jokes about penises and balls. Nothing anyone but dummies would want to see, but hey, this is in the jungle, and these are fascinating 'original' people. Well, not here, here it's dumb. The rest is the most stomach turning brutality. When some speak of Reservoir Dogs as brutal, that cartoon violence is nothing, compared to the smashing of bone and slicing of flesh here. Reservoir Dogs was stylized, but this is bloodthirsty. When people would say that, well, yes, that's how they live, I'd say nonsense, anthropologically, that's nonsense, and this is just an excuse for the bloodthirsty-minded. The rest of the film is the people left getting taken away, and one guy running back. There's really nothing more to it. There's no brains involved here, or needed. If the crack of skulls, the ripping of knife-severed flesh does it for you, then good, as that's all there is here.",Apocalypto
307,ilikepuppies,"""Give Me Back My Son!!!""",3,9 June 2007,"I'd like to say up front that I came to this having very minimal opinion of Mel as a filmmaker, or an actor for that matter. The former because I had only seen one of his offerings long ago (""Braveheart"") and the latter because his acting creates no impression, whether good or bad.As the film began for this impartial viewer, I immediately realized that this is not going to be coming from a particularly intelligent source, judging by the vacuous opening quote shown in script: ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" -W. Durant The use of this quote also hints that the war-popularization machine is cranking.So in the first few moments I was taken from no expectations to low expectations.On to the body of the film, where it is obvious within the first few shots that Mel is simply emulating the greats (or at least the ones he considers great.) In our very first shot, he enters us into this world Malick-style, that of sweeping through nature's inherent peace. Then on to Kubrick's ""2001,"" with the shot of the bone flying through the air (and again later with the eclipse.) Then he reminds us how graphic was the climactic slaughter scene in ""Apocalypse Now."" (Hence, ""Apocalypto."") And on.I must just say something about that scene. See, the problem is that Mel actually thinks that he can capture the power which Coppola harnessed by simply replacing an ox (?) with a pig. Not so, evidently.Gibson goes on to quote others throughout. Kurosawa, Herzog, even Stallone. But none as much as Costner, as the film settles in firmly to Dances With Wolves mode. In fact Gibson and Costner are very similar in that neither has any real vision but are steadfast in their quest for Academy Awards above all else. I predict a couple ""Waterworld"" style bombs for Mel in the near future.So here are the Gibson Formal Rules for Attempted Oscar Glory:*-Subtitles are an absolute must, for at least a portion of the film.-Nudity, check.-""Realistic"" brutality is good for at least a few nominations.-Must include the emotional trigger of family dishonor at the hands of an enemy people.-It's very important to overlay a story of personal struggle on top of a larger clash, one of historic proportions.So as we can see, Mel finally reveals that his favorite filmmaker is actually himself, as we have all the hallmarks of a Gibson movie intact. In fact he is still also in love with his own 80s action persona, as the film deteriorates into a straight-up eye-roller, in the form of the cliché of that era. You know, every one of those 80s action flicks simply had to finally include a showdown between alpha-tough-guys, a la Arnie, Sly and Chuck. And Mel.The editing is particularly bad, especially during the cat chase sequence which lasted far too long and was poorly paced. The slow-motion used in said fight scene was terribly hackneyed. Melodrama galore.Hard for this viewer to believe there was no controversy surrounding this film, given the well-publicized exposure of his anti-Semitic rants. Could have been spun.*Even with limited exposure to Mel I know these rules because they are relentlessly marketed at the public in the promotions of all his films.",Apocalypto
308,cribyn44,Brilliant and Edge-of-the-Seat-Gripping !,10,10 January 2007,"I deliberately avoided reading all reviews of Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" because I didn't want to know beforehand what it was about and how the film turned out. I am so glad that I approached this film in that way since everything in it - the story, the acting, and the elements of spectacle halfway through - was a complete and utter, and very pleasing, surprise.I agree entirely with all the other positive comments about this film, and especially the breath-taking reconstructions of the Mayan city and the blood sacrificial ceremonies. That section of the film really blew your mind! My wife (who comes from South America) and I also agreed about the totally positive use of actors who weren't the usual ""whites"" dressed up as ""natives"" but looked the genuine article. And, as with Gibson's use of Aramaic in ""The Passion of the Christ"", what really grabbed one in the film was the innovative use of the Mayan language throughout.However, the point at which I almost jumped off my seat to applaud the total brilliance of the shots were the very final scenes....which I shan't mention here in case I spoil the film for other viewers. For me, they were an absolute masterstroke by Mel Gibson which sent you out of the cinema thinking more deeply about what you had just seen.We should like to see the film again, soon, in a cinema before it comes out on DVD - a definite buy for us! - except that here in the United Kingdom the enjoyment of films in cinemas is always spoilt by those people who crinkle and crackle their popcorn bags non-stop throughout a film. In London, there are only about one or two cinemas which don't allow that thundering nuisance in their auditoria.",Apocalypto
309,wuxmup,"In the grand tradition of ""Passion"" and ""Caligula""",2,30 June 2007,"A tough film to review because it's qualities are so wildly uneven. Cinematography: state-of-the-art, beautifully done.Costumes and make-up: like nothing you've seen in a movie.Casting: excellent.SFX: technically great.Direction: fine.Performances: mostly limited to three facial expressions - ""My God, I'm gonna die!"" ""He He! You're gonna die!"" and ""Kill someone already!""Characterization: noble, innocent victims of rape, torture, and murder; sadistic rapists, torturers, and murderers; cynical priests and rulers; zombie-like crowds.Plot: kill, rape, torture, then torture, kill, torture, and chase, die, kill, kill, etc.Dialogue: first half elementary; second half minimal.Historical accuracy: Hollywood-level; the sadists seem to be Aztecs, but everybody speaks Mayan; visuals look like a hodgepodge of Mesoamerican art.Should appeal strongly to: fans of action, bloody murder, calculated cruelty, and death; (there's some smallpox too, and something called ""laughing sickness,"" previously reported only from Papua-New Guinea); the rapes are off-camera, so there's no sex here to disconcert parents.Let's get real. This movie functions as pure spectacle. Its primary ingredients are extreme violence (yes, it could be worse), brutal sadism, and running through the jungle. Viewers who give ten stars are entranced by technical proficiency and sensational sights. They must also be so desensitized to brutal film sadism that it doesn't affect them - or else they really love seeing hearts cut realistically from chests, people slowly murdered while their kids watch, slow semi-strangulation, you know, that kind of thing. In Gibson's ""Braveheart,"" you had some slaughtering, hanging, and disemboweling in addition to standard battle scenes. In Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" you had an innocent Man lynched, tortured, and crucified in excruciating detail. In Gibson's ""Apocalypto,"" you have what's described above, plus extreme tattooings and body-piercings, some of which may not be physiologically possible. If ""Apocalypto"" is your meat, your idea of a great movie, go for it. I pity those close to you and I tremble for my country. On the other hand, if Gibson's human-sacrifice theory of mass entertainment disturbs you deeply or just makes you sick, stay as far away from him and his films as you possibly can.",Apocalypto
310,clearthinkernow,entire movie in foreign language,6,24 April 2014,"A movie which forces you to read English translation throughout will always be considerably downgraded by me. If your attention is taken up with trying to find out what the characters are saying, then you can't see the action much. Either my eyes are on the bottom of the screen with the subtitles or they can watch the entire screen but they cannot do both. Could have been a much better movie if I could have watched it. Might just as well read a transcript and forget about the visual altogether.

312,colinbarnard-1,Six Point Nine for Good Intentions,7,9 December 2006,"I'm writing this literally 30 minutes after leaving the theatre. So, what you are about to read is more visceral than necessarily thoughtful (but I will try!).There ain't much of a plot in Mel's latest opus. The film is a Mel-described ""chase film"", so I imagine that plot isn't the main thrust. The exposition of the Mayan culture lasts about 30 minutes and is rather cursory and superficial. It is obvious, though, that Mel has read Jared Diamond's ""Collapse"".The film's redemption is the unity of vision that Mel brings to the screen. This is a film that was not made for commerce, as a primary concern. Mel's humanism shines through in this movie: this is NOT the work of a racist! To film an entirely indigenous American cast in an indigenous American language is the mark of profound respect.On a technical note, the film was shot with the Panavision Genesis digital system. The picture quality and framing of the shots are quite spectacular: my hat's off to the D.P.I was in Veracruz Mexico in May of this year when Mel was filming ""Apocalypto"" on the outskirts. I actually SCUBA dived one day with one of the lighting gaffers. He related to me that Mel was held in high regard by all the crew, who profoundly respected the authenticity that he brought to the production. I was also told about his loyalty and his generosity of spirit. Whatever offensive words Mel uttered in the summer should not dissuade the public from seeing his latest film. Whether it is a good film or not, it is an important one.",Apocalypto
313,ProfessorFate,Insert Superlatives Here,9,1 June 2007,"Let me begin by saying I am no fan of Mel Gibson. Actually I am a former fan turned bitter critic. I love his early work as an actor in ""Mad Max"", ""Gallipoli"", and especially ""The Year of Living Dangerously"", but was greatly disappointed by the crap that follow: ""Bird on a Wire"", ""Air America"", ""Maverick"", the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, etc. I thought he showed some ambition by playing ""Hamlet"", but it seemed more like a desperate attempt by a ""movie star"" to prove to everybody he could ""do serious work"". Then came ""Braveheart"", which I think is fairly entertaining but obviously a rip-off, sort of ""Spartacus Goes to England"". Of course Gibson won lots of big awards for that film and became the darling of Hollywood, while I stewed about his renewed popularity. Then came more crap like ""Conspiracy Theory"", ""What Women Want"", ""The Patriot"". He became an actor that I actively avoided at the box office. His anti-Semetic rantings and recent DUI arrest just confirmed what a ""tosser"" he really was. ""See, I told you so.""Then I saw the trailers for ""Apocalypto"". Against my better judgment I bought a ticket, fully prepared to be duped by Gibson once again.Mel, if you're reading this, all is forgiven.""Apocalypto"" is one of the most exciting, suspenseful, and original films I've ever seen. Who'd have thought that a film about Mayan Indians, without a word of English in it, could be so satisfying? The simplicity of the plot, the lushness of the cinematography, the immediacy of the conflict, the brutal honesty of the violence, the dogged determination of the main character, the manic pacing and editing, the thrilling discovery of worlds we've never seen before, all combine to make this a fantastic film. Yes it's violent and bloody, but the violence is appropriate to the subject matter and it's certainly no worse than most of the artless schlock unleashed upon us every Halloween.Move over Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson is ready to challenge you for the title of best actor-turned-director.

314,samuraifa451,Mel Gibson has a brutal but exciting adventure film,7,4 December 2007,"It's a shame that Mel Gibson had to act so dumbly prior to this film's release because it's actually pretty good and would've made so much more had he not said what he said. The storyline is disturbing, intense, and fun. Several scenes will have you literally on the edge of your seat cheering on our hero: Jaguar's Paw, who's desperately trying to escape from vicious Mayans who want to use him for ritual sacrifice and get to his trapped wife and son. First, I give viewers fair warning if you are queasy via gore, do not even try to watch this movie. It's starts off with Mayans hunting a Tapir and only gets worse from there. Nevertheless, if you're willing to try and sit through this gory film the rewards are excellent. Action sequences are well shot and the storyline is always exciting. The only problem with this film is once our hero begins to battle his foes in the jungle it kind of seems like its nothing more than a Rambo knock-off although it's extremely well-done. If you're in for adventure, and gore doesn't scare you, look no further than Apocalypto.",Apocalypto
315,bigkingtut2000,A great story that a Mayan historian would appreciate!,9,25 May 2007,"Mel Gibson is fast becoming one of the great cinematic storytellers of our generation. In Apocalypto he recreated a jungle Mayan tribe. With an exquisite eye for detail and a fantastic camera work. We go hunting with our idyllic tribe and meet the various hunters and their families. One hunter, Jaguar's Paw, has a spiritualness about him, its this inner-sense that will later save his life. Gibson's tribe is pillaged by Mayan's from the city on a slaver/sacrifice raid. Jaguar Paw is the first to sense something was wrong. He saves his own family but goes back to help his family and friends. In that effort he is captured. Gibson takes us through the jungle to a huge Mayan city. Where we come upon limestone mines. The Mayans used limestone to path their streets and to use on their great buildings. At first, we think our tribe is going to be used for slave labor. But, no, the actual mining for limestone has corrupted the soil and the Mayan city is starving. Our tribe is brought to a sacrificial temple where they are offered to the gods as sacrifice to get their crops to grow. There are graphic scenes of organs being pulled from bodies and beheadings. But, in the true Mayan and Aztec societies, these rituals could have been even more barbaric. So, Gibson could have went even further and been historically accurate but, he didn't, and we got the message. When our friend, Jaguar's Paw, is brought to the sacrificial altar a total solar eclipse happens and our tribe is seemingly spared from the altar. Only to be used as target practice for the Mayan warriors. This too, is another historically correct sequence, where warriors honed their craft on captured Indians. Our surviving tribe members are told that if they get past the cornfield at the end of the stadium, they are only moments from the jungle and their freedom. Reminiscent of the great Cornell Wilde's Naked Prey. I strongly recommend you watch this film. It's an amazing story told by Gibson with a surprise ending in keeping with our historical theme!",Apocalypto

I caught up with the film again recently and am now compelled to write a brief review having read some of the conkers that have been written about it elsewhere!I find it strange that there are those who will lambaste this film purely because they do not like Gibson's politics or religious views...bizarre...the man, as a film maker is an outstanding talent, a visionary story teller par excellence.The film is not a joyful ride..but it is a ride...a rush from start to finish depicting his vision of what these now long gone 'civilisations' meant on a day by day basis. There is for sure what we would now call barbarism but surely this is just showing us, the modern watcher, how life was so cheap and the taking of it so matter of fact.There is conflict, baddies...a love interest and a resolution as well as a thrilling and gripping chase full of drama and jeopardy in which the 'hero' of the piece of course triumphs in the end.A thoroughly entertaining piece of work from Mel Gibson, possibly his finest as a director, the man deserves huge respect for his films and I give him mine wholeheartedly as he has made the transition from Hollywood heart throb to serious film maker.Top notch stuff!",Apocalypto

Yes, Apocalypto is creative and different, and yes, I have never seen major movie about the pre- Columbian Central America. Unfortunately, this is not a insightful exploration about village life or about the brutal wars that occurred. Neither is it a movie about how all people throughout time are the same in some universal way. The real message of the movie is to give an evil depiction of pre-Columbian life to justify the brutal colonization of central America by the Spanish. Apocalypto has a ton of brutality without any levity in the latter two hours. This is not similar to the violence of Kill Bill, which was highly stylized and spaced out. In a good movie the violence would be in the service of a bigger message, but there isn't one here.I did not enjoy the movie, and it was not worthwhile.

There's a diminishing sense of purpose or resolve for his characters in his directorial output, a psychological disconnect, a lack of empathy where suffering is a goal unto itself. Everybody just needs to get punished in his movies, it seems.Possibly for the crime of being human. You know;-Original sin. The younger or more innocent the victim, the harsher the torture. Human degradation meticulously recorded and cataloged. With the now trademark scenes of slow torture in pretty locales. He seems more and more to forget to actually tell a story. Let alone let justice be served. Compared to other directors focusing on ethics like for instance Clint Eastwood, where you get a sense of purpose and justice through it all, Gibson comes off like like an old fire and brimstone preacher. Without the redemption part. Don't get surprised if his next project is a 3 hour+ epic retelling of Noa's Ark. Then he can actually (slowly)kill off almost everyone on this whole godforsaken planet. The first 20 minutes of the movie would be old N stoically hammering away in the rain.Token intro done with and the fun-fest starts: People of all creed and race; slowly flailing men,women and children coughing,crying in the rain and drowning, pleading to no avail.Pan and scan, the whole world. Drowning. -Mothers giving birth whilst drowning; going under, newborn bobbing up to the surface, -a glint of hope; getting dragged down after the mother by the umbilical-cord. Camera following down in the churning waters cataloging every dying spasm of the baby. And so on for three hours-. The last 40 seconds will show a small plant sticking out of the water.

Is worth watching in a sense but after watching not wroth believing.This film is not a matter of strict believing because it gives a presupposed human nature as adopted to Maya culture from my point of view. Which is Gibson's view. The strict differentiation was made over the bad and the good in the film and also the Maya beliefs as well.These made me think that from these perspectives the philosophy of the film is missing. Yes, it is an action film. But the capture scenes are so long that it in a sense bores as well.",Apocalypto

Perhaps, the best thing was the return to making a making with very little CGI. The costumes and scenery displayed great details and realism. The movie gives you a feeling that you are there in the story. This can be bad news, because it is true for the more gritty, disturbing and gruesome scene, where the savagery of the Mayan Natives are viewed. And it does not hold back. Nit picking, I probably would not have called it Apocalypto, which to me is a much broader term, where this was a story about a tribe/individual. I understand that underlying themes are broader, but the main heart of the film is smaller. My guess is that this is why it was not as accepted as well as it could have been. The name Apocalypto sets certain expectations on the storyline that were not met.Overall awesome movie.",Apocalypto

A survivor leaves behind his past and his future as he is dragged to his sacrifice. In an attempt to show the machine underlying sacrificial practise, we have a naive observer with a band of brothers who are witness. Very simple motifs are applied, from hunter/ prey to loss/redemption. At the beginning, the naive observer is threatened by fear. At the end, the naive observer has matured, to be replaced with the wise man who simply negotiates five hundred years of pitfalls.But this movie is about Gibson's politics. Not the movie itself, but the perception of the movie. The Shakespearian storyline, brilliant cinematography (thanks Mr Semmler), unique casting and natural language would earn critical praise with another producer. Instead, lies are being substituted for criticism, which works in news media when reporting on a conservative president, but which just looks small minded and mean in the face of such art.",Apocalypto

I thought Daniel Craig went through hell in one sequence in Casino Royale... this kid had the snot beat out of him for the entire shoot.

323,kevino-4,Somewhere between....,7,8 January 2008,"a six and a seven for me. There are many pluses, the story of chase and vengeance makes for exciting theatre, the characters are drawn well, and the film is beautifully shot. Special effects, as in the animals, injuries, bodies, etc., are pretty much flawless. And the director made you care what happened to the lead characters. The first half moves along pretty well, and with some convenient plot contrivances, so does the second half. A negative was continuity. There is a scene where the hero is being chased by a jaguar, shown running a few feet behind him. For the convenience of the shot the chase lasts a minute or so, where in reality it would last a few seconds, if that. There are several shots where men are running twenty feet behind the injured hero and they don't get him. Again, in real life they generally do. Reality gets strained in other ways. There is a scene where our hero is standing a hundred yards or so from the bottom of a wide eighty foot drop waterfall, yelling up at men standing at the top some feet beyond the beginning of the falls, and the men can apparently not only hear his voice but make out his words. If you've ever been in a bathroom with water is running in the shower you know how difficult that can make hearing a few feet away. And in that same shot his injured torso is healed. A crucial scene displays a full eclipse of the sun taking place in entirety within three or four minutes. All of these mean you have to cooperate with the film to stay in it. I think that's taking the requirement to suspend belief a bit too far. With all that, it is great spectacle. Prepare for a large dose of violence, blood and anguish, with a happy if fantastically coincidental ending.",Apocalypto
324,Attila_the_gorilla,The most important movie ever made. Full stop.,10,11 October 2007,"Again, I'm gonna have trouble getting 10 lines together, but I needed to review this one. My favourite movie for sure, nothing has ever come close. I'm personally into indigenous living and especially self-sufficient living.The movie is about a small tribe of jungle dwellers in the age of Mayan domination. These people are not part of the 'great' Mayan civilization, they live in isolated freedom. They are self-sufficient jungle-dwellers who take everything they need from the forest, build their own shelter, hunt and forage. This true freedom gets destroyed by the dominating city state, whose servants go to the jungle to collect jungle dwellers to sacrifice to the gods and for slavery.This story is not gonna give you a history lesson on the 'great technological advancements and accomplishments' of the dominating city states. But it sure is a perfectly correct insight into the conflict between, on the one hand, domination, controlled 'empires' and mass ignorance, and on the other hand, autonomous, self-sufficient living off the land.The main character's quest is to save himself from execution and reunite with his young family, but the way I saw it was more than that. A deep, ever relevant conflict between the two worlds and ways of life. And this movie's deeply caring desire to tackle this most important topic of all would almost be enough to call it one of the best ever. But it's also very well presented, thrilling and visually stunning, with an intense yet comfortable attention to detail.The only thing I didn't like was that for some strange reason all these wilderness people were perfectly clean shaven, straight out of a Gillette advert. This may be historically correct, though I struggle to believe that these natural people would find a reason to shave. Other than this minor flaw, I found nothing wrong with the movie. Mel Gibson has done it again.",Apocalypto
325,lourensini,"Different from every movie you have ever seen,",8,8 March 2012,"I hardly rate a movie 9. Simply because they usually doesn't leave any impression of originality. But Apocalypto did.The actors aren't famous, and I hardly believe you will recognize any of them from another performance, but they can make you believe in they role with a great naturally. And since we don't get much idea about Maian accent, this characteristic gets even better.Watch a movie about an extinct crowd in a extinct language makes it even more realistic, and that is like if we could watch Spartacus on Greek (not extinct language, but you can have an idea) and besides that , Apocalyto's anthropology history class sometimes look like a BBC documentary, but I must say this could deeper.Even the characters hardly have a name, and they all look the same, they're personalities can be distinguished, what makes us understand whats going on the movie and who's doing what. That said, we can also note that ain't much characters to divide our attention with, and this is a well balanced thing, because they're faces are quite the same, whats is mostly because of they're Warrior Make up.Appocalypto doesn't impressive by it's soundtrack, I just think it could be better explored. An impressive soundtrack would make this movie unforgettable (more than it already is). Perhaps just by making a more constantly soundtrack and given it volume in the fight scenes.Movie photography is made to look like a real vision, but this could also be changed (notice the word I'm using is ""changed"", and not ""improved"") just by giving it more aggressive green and red colors, just like what was done with blue.

I was reminded of ""Last of the Mohicans"" - as with that film I quickly connected with the main characters and felt part of their world due to excellent casting and character development. The filming and action scenes (especially the editing) looked like ""The Seven Samuri"" in many places. Using unknown actors was a stroke of genius and added to the immersion. Many critics talked of the excess gore/blood - but I don't agree. It is violent and there there is blood but again it was similar to the violence/blood in ""last of the Mohicans,"" necessary but not overdone. I am not sure if this is a message film but without a doubt it is entertaining.SPOILER ALERT The most difficult scene to sit thru was the wife at the end, but the actress really delivered her performance if you know what I mean.",Apocalypto

I wanted this movie to last 10 hours :) Choosing Mayan language is just brilliant, actors, costumes and make-up is nothing short of amazing. Yeah, it has gory scenes, but nothing even remotely crappy and boring like the ""saw"" and it's retarded series had, so i don't see any reason for people comparing them. Unfortunately while stunning visuals mesmerizes you, story fails to deliver the full blow, if Gibson spent some more time polishing it, it would probably be one of the greatest movies of all time.

The only reason I was able to finish this blood fest is because at least the violence in this mess wasn't perpetrated against Christ. But it was still a non-stop succession of murder. I didn't turn it off because I was with friends and sat through it for their sake.But it wasn't just murder and bludgeoning; there is a lot of running in this movie. Those folks in South America sure can run. They can run for miles. Through trees, mud, quicksand and even after being speared and pierced through and through with an arrow. By the time you fished this movie you will be worn out just from watching all this running. Not only that, you will be so desensitized to violence that you will be able to watch be-headings on the Internet while eating a sandwich.What did we do to make Hollywood think this is what we want?",Apocalypto
329,grindhouse74,A Great Rumble In The Jungle,10,7 November 2007,"In the past Mel Gibson has done some entertaining films from his Mad Max and Lethal Weapon franchise to Payback and The Patriot, but as a director he has excelled from films like Braveheart to The Pasion Of The Christ And now Apocalypto and what a great movie it is.In the twilight of the Mayan culture, Jaguar Paw and some of his village natives is captured and taken to the mysterious Mayan city, where he faces a disturbing and untimely end. Driven by the love of his family, he makes a frantic escape through the jungle to be reunited with his family and to save his life, while he is being pursued by his brutal captors, this is were the film kicks up a gear.What Mel Gibson has done, is transport the viewer back to that time and era, and created a thrill ride of intense action and some brutal set pieces. When it comes to the chase and some expected violent confrontations, Mel Gibson knows exactly what he's doing, as he has shown with Braveheart and The Pasion Of The Christ, he does not hold back. The decision to use the native language of ""Yucatec Maya"" is brave, but it works. A solid film that works on so many levels, worth checking out, you'll be glad you did.",Apocalypto
330,jsmog,Pretty but rather unbelievable,5,18 March 2012,"I was surprised at the number of strong reviews for this film...it contains two errors that rendered it ridiculous for me.First of all, the film is full of ""deus ex machina"" moments, like most adventure movies, where the hero is saved in the nick of time, but I've always found them ridiculous and uncomfortable. I like seeing people get by on their wits and skills, not some silly coincidence. And two of them in this film are doozies.First, the hero is about to be sacrificed when he is saved by an eclipse of the sun, which terrifies the Mayans. This is an old yarn in European-meets-savage stories going back hundreds of years. It is especially galling when used against the Mayans, who at their peak could have predicted an eclipse better than any European culture.Second, the hero is again saved when his last two pursuers are stunned into silence, and let him go (even though he has killed several of their friends) by the sight of Spanish ships on the horizon. The Spanish did not arrive in Mesoamerica until several hundred years after the Mayan empires where memories, and they did not explore the Yucatan until many years after they had successfully conquered the Aztecs.The film is fascinating to look at, but these kinds of errors (and many others which seem to conflate the Mayans with the later Aztec Empire) make it a one-screening film for me. A more interesting film along similar lines is the Mexican ""Cabeza de Vaca"", which strives to tell a true story with some accuracy about the Mesoamericans.",Apocalypto

It's an attitude, a pervasive contrivance and adherence to trivial convention that kills any sense of credulity about the film. Well this film doesn't have that, in fact what it has instead is a whole lot of novel thinking about the way its narrative develops and how it is conveyed.That's not so say the film doesn't have its touch stones, for instance the Tapir scene early in the film, acknowledges well trodden proverbial ground as does one of the major plot points of the film. Thing is though, these incidents are woven into the narrative as a means to connect with the audience not tagged on cos the writers ran out of ideas.The other thing this film has is immersion, it's remains believable throughout, whatever is happening on screen.

335,mjscarface,"Thrilling and bloody, but with lots of 'heart'(!)",8,28 April 2007,"Apocalypto is a film that succeeds in it's first 10 minutes. With an opening sequence not unlike 'Last of the Mohicans', we are quickly introduced to a group of Mayan hunters who, after catching their prey, enjoy a good laugh and a bit of banter. It becomes clear from the off that we are going to like these characters and will be rooting for them from here on in.Because Gibson takes the time to sketch out a whole village of likable and believable characters, the ensuing carnage is given more substance. When his village is ravaged by another tribe, a man named Jaguar Paw hides his family in a deep cave and is captured. After some stirring fight scenes, the surviving villagers are led through the jungle and arrive at an awesome city with huge stone monuments and temples. But the grandeur of the city quickly turns into horror as Jaguar Paw and his fellow men are to be sacrificed. Seizing an opportunity, he makes an escape and becomes the hunted.The film is certainly entertaining, although some scenes outstay their welcome and could have done with cutting down. But on the whole, the journey from A to B (and back to A) went by fairly quickly. The outbursts of violence are certainly graphic and its obvious that Gibson is a bit of a gore-hound, but thats OK with me. I liked the lead character despite a surprising lack of dialogue he seemed to be given. Also, his father and fellow tribesman Blunted were both very engaging, humorous and moving. But my favourite character and real villain of the piece was Middle Eye who took way too much pleasure in violence and came across like a weasel-faced bastard child of Magua (from Mohicans) and was a delightfully hateful character.As I mentioned, the film opens very well and the ending has a nice touch to it, without giving anything away. Overall, I was impressed by the film and would certainly see it again on DVD!",Apocalypto

I was probably around 10 years old when she allowed me watch this film and despite not picking up on a lot of the story I always had the image of a man's headless body tumbling down the side of a funny looking pyramid and I think that scene alone made me fall in love with this movie.That being said I think that aside from my personal bias, I think this film was really well done telling a story about a man who is fighting for his family which I think everyone can relate to. Shot in a way that really keeps the audiences attention keeping your heart pumping as if it was you who was running for your life. I am not really sure how the filmmakers are able to accomplish this but I found it to be quite affective.So I gave this movie an 8/10 because I think that this was a captivating movie that help my attention every second of the film.So to state it bluntly I absolutely loved watching this film, and I find that with each viewing I fall in love with it over and over again. I think this movie is a great representation of how brutal the world was and despite a lot of the world becoming more civil, the same religious restrictions and beliefs are still harming todays society. Now I know that there are no longer true sacrifices where hearts are literally cut out of ones chest, it is still relevant that people of different faiths still have a disconnect and I love how ironically the director that is responsible for this movie is also known for having extreme religious beliefs and has a record of saying some controversial things.",Apocalypto

Although Mel Gibson has been surrounded by controversy regarding recent racist comments that should not hinder anyones desire to see this movie. Finally Mel Gibson makes a movie with a happy ending. The film starts out in a quiet village in pre-colonial Mexico. A group of hunters are out in the woods stalking prey when they run across a band of refugees. Not too far behind are Mayan warriors in search of captives for human sacrifices in order to please their gods. Jagwar Paw and several of his comrades are taken prisoner and brought to the Mayan capitol of Chichen Itza to be sacrificed. Due to divine intervention Paw manages to escape sacrifice only to be hunted by Mayan soldiers for the deaths he caused during his daring escape. Also his wife and young child are trapped in a well back in his home village.

""Apocalypto"" is a tour de force, a rousing action epic that's also a commentary of the decline of modern Western civilization. It's a unique experience, there's no other film like it, and Gibson's direction is assured, confident and powerful. Because of Gibson's behavior, I boycotted the film upon its initial release but was stunned after word of mouth wore me down and it showed up on one of the pay cable channels. The first time I saw it I was figuratively blown away, and repeated viewings have only deepened my admiration. A one-of-a-kind movie from a singularly talented filmmaker.

Then again, I still think take out the religious affiliations, ""The Passion"" is a glorified snuff film. Prob because I've seen those kinds of movies before and can actually compare them. The basic premise tribe A captures tortures kills tribe B. It is as black and white as all of Mel's movies. I.e. it shows an innocent family life, and then an invading force made of purely evil two dimensional characters. If you want to see some mindless, but somewhat fun action and brutality and you don't mind disturbing images.. this movie may work for you.

Speaking of history, the Mayan and the landing of the first Europeans were actually hundreds of years of apart, whereas this historically shockingly plot places them together, not to mention their proximity was vastly geographically distorted. Maybe I've been spoiled by the gore porn of all the Saw-type movies, but the action sequences done in this film were kind of awful.

I was apprehensive going in...in fact I must admit I tuned out after 15 minutes my first time, but when I stuck it out the second time, I was blown away. I think this is one of the best movies of a notoriously weak movie decade (V for Vendetta, The Hurt Locker and Children of Men are other candidates) and is definitely the most original.The film is set in Mexico during the Mayan civilization and early on a Mayan camp is attacked by another tribe and Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and others are taken prisoner and are to be sacrificed to the gods. The scene at the temple where the sacrifices occur is fascinating and is cut short by a solar eclipse. Apparently the gods are appeased and a few Mayans are spared, including Jaguar Paw.It seems being spared from sacrifice in those days wasn't necessarily such a good thing because what they have the rest of the prisoners do instead hardly seems better, but at least there is a slight chance for survival. If there is a chance for survival, Jaguar Paw's the kind of warrior who is going to find it, and this is where the movie really accelerates and becomes an exhilarating run through the jungle with Jaguar Paw being chased by a group of his captors.I've spared you from much of the detail so that, in case you haven't seen this movie, you will enjoy it all the more. Jaguar Paw is very resourceful to say the least and by the time this chase is over you will be drained. It's awesome...hats off to Mel Gibson for giving us this fresh, original film. You can see elements of ""Braveheart"" and ""Passion of the Christ"" in this film, however for a purely mesmerizing and unique entertainment experience, I think Apocalypto may be the best of them all.",Apocalypto
344,hereontheoutside,he tried so hard to make it tolerable for the audience that you almost want to tolerate it,6,26 June 2007,"What appears to be Braveheart in Mexico, with a stuffed jaguar, turns to be a much smaller, more fragile film. Mel Gibson seems to have, at least initially, found a story that takes a major period of Latin history and made a small, intriguing film. That's how I felt after the first half hour. Then he brings in elements of Predator, Evil Dead and the plot-negating ending of an M. Night Shamalyan film. There is a real lack of consistency in the film. I could say many blanket statements that would need an amendment at the end so I could maintain my dignity. An example may illuminate the watery oil consistency of the film. I say: the film is beautifully shot, except for that part where the main character is hunted through the woods like Predator, when Gibson tries to get stylized, hip and fresh and comes off like an old man consulting a manual on how to raise the tension in a film. Or I could say: The acting is pretty good for non-actors, except for the part with the fake jaguar, which, I hate to include any disclosure of events from the film, but the jaguar attack is like something from Army of Darkness, It is clearly a doll and not a jaguar and the camera just keeps lingering over the lifeless eye of the jaguar. My ten-year- old brother shot an attack sequence a lot like that on my parents VHS camcorder. He held the leg of the doll that wasn't on screen and shook it over his friends face. Basically what happens in Apocalypto. The film loses all humanistic qualities by the end. Everything redeemable about the film is thrown out the window as the film descends into the classic world of camp films. In a few years, when film snobs decide to get over Mel Gibson's anti-Semitism and watch this, it could easily be a campy midnight classic. The film ultimately fails, while keeping you on the edge of your seat wondering when it will whirlpool into crap. Keep waiting, it will.www.mplsreview.blogspot.com",Apocalypto
345,schaefer.oliver,Good film hampered by the use of an ancient language and the use of subtitles,7,21 December 2006,"First, it was another good film directed by Mel Gibson. Second, what the hell are the critics writing about excessive violence and lots of gore? This wasn't anywhere near the level of violence in Braveheart used and it wasn't even as gratuitously bloody as Gibson Passion of the Christ. Third, for me after Passion of the Christ it's the second time Mel Gibson made the wrong decision regarding the use of an ancient language. I can understand that decision from an artistic point of view, but for me, it distances myself from the movie and it's protagonists. I watched both films with great anticipation but the use of subtitles and ancient language barred me from feeling involved or developing anything like compassion for anyone on the screen. In both cases it was like watching a kind of documentary. It's just distracting from what goes on above the screen. I'm totally OK with subtitles in a film like maybe Dances with wolves, where there's an English speaking man who can't understand the native Americans, but in a movie where everyone speaks the same language, except the audience, where's the point? The movie looks great. Fantastic locations and production design, great photography and editing. Especially Dean Semler's camera is fantastic. The mostly unknown cast does a great job, especially Rudy Youngblood, who may be someone to watch for in the future. So I hope, that Mel Gibson makes his next movie something I can understand without subtitles, so I can become more involved.",Apocalypto

Apocalypto is unlike anything I've seen before in terms of subject matter. It's also a nail-biter and a popcorn movie with archetypal and somewhat clichéd themes. Yet it doesn't let up for a minute and is extremely well-done. One thought kept running frantically through my mind--Mel is NOT well. Wow. This film will delight the sadists among us. It's beyond visceral. Mel certainly makes a damn good action flick, however. The cinematography is gorgeous and gripping, and the ornamentation and decoration on the actors are engrossing and visually surreal. I kept thinking about some of the Cantina characters in Star Wars when I was watching the frightening scenes where Jaguar Paw and crew are walking single file through the crowd in the city. If you love great action movies and sci-fi, this one is for you. It's not a sci-fi flick, but it often seems like one!

The kids were tremendous, especially the 'sickness' kid who spoke of the Omen, in the middle of the hot desolated place, halfway towards the stone city or the empire.Mel Gibson (Producer, Director, Writer (written by) of Apocalypto) has definitely written, directed and produced one of the best movies of the year.

I can hardly do a summary for his cinematic career 'cause his works are really hard to categorize and may I say --- ""in a mess"". However, he always managed to surprise me. However controversial his films may be, they have reasons which I'm willing to accept.This film is a milestone to be recorded in cinematic history for its ancient theme, unprecedented language, insufferable contents and all other pleasant enough aspects of film-making.Living in this modern world, we hardly bother to ask what we are and where we're from. We know Darwin's theory. We know life changes and is not easy. But we never know in detail what happened to our ancestors as individuals. We just sum them up into a few paragraphs on some history book.This film is about Maya, yet it also applies to every other ancient civilization. It threw me into the ancient jungle and carried me on this incredible journey of knives and arrows, ignorance and intelligence, death and birth, love and hatred...Despite all the blood and tension, I have to admit the primitive did a good job to carry on the human evolution --- at least, we are here with flesh and blood.I had this imagery that if the whole evolution thing is a huge army and all humans are just allocated at random by God into some squads categorized by eras, and I ask myself, ""If my soul happened to be allocated into the Mayan 'Squad', would I survive and had a life in peace and love?""It's a rather frustrating question since I'll never know the answer. Well, most possibly the answer is negative...Anyway, we don't necessarily need the answer, but we do need the consciousness and introspection because when we project ourselves against the primitive background, we can always discover new things in our body and soul.In that case, this film itself is an apocalypto lest we forget how different yet common we are compared to our ancestors.",Apocalypto

It's far too simplistic to act as your typical epic since the entire plot could be explained about as quickly as any of the 'Texas Chainsaw' flicks, but it's also far more entertaining and doesn't try to over-step itself, meaning it knows its just a movie and acts as so throughout. For instance, although the people in this film may have been born and raised in the jungle, their physical durability and resilience is more than a little incredible, and the screenplay also gives new meaning to the word 'coincidence' on at least two occasions that come to mind. Also, in addition to APOCALYPTO'S implausibility, Jaguar Poo...or whatever his name is, isn't someone I related to very much, and would have liked to have cared more about him and his freaky cave family. ~ Basically, it's obvious Gibson didn't have 'greatness' in mind by any means. Yet, he did accomplish more than just gore and entertainment value; from beginning to end this film is very well shot, and Gibson showcases his immense talent behind the camera by effectively tackling the challenge of the film's setting, paying attention to detail and not selling out by dubbing in English or anything like that .

The rest of the movie is about a young man who escapes being sacrificed and has to eliminate the soldiers hunting him.This movie is packed with gorgeous cinematography and the acting is superb, but the scene with the solar eclipse was inaccurate and I don't think someone could run at full speed through a jungle all night without resting, but this is still a very intense and breathtaking experience.",Apocalypto

There seems to have been much comment on the historical accuracy of the movie, but this movie is more about high-octane adventure than historical documentary. Despite inaccuracies, the movie is a fascinating insight into what we know of this ancient culture.Some scenes are quite gory but not gratuitous, with the most heinous, such as rape, occurring off screen. The locations, costumes and props are wonderful, and the action is great from start to finish. There are several extended chase sequence, most notably the forty minute final chase, which are intense and brilliantly put together.

Also here in France , stupids and untrue reviews in official movies magazines , what is all this ?It seems they try to attack Mel Gibson instead to review a movie for some reasons maybe because he makes goods movies making Hollywood productions looks stupid and lame , maybe because he has made a Christian movie about Jesus, maybe because his private life , maybe because all this we see personal attacks disguised under fakes movies reviews WHAT A SHAME , fortunately we have IMDb to have some good , clear and honest movies reviews.I never say that before but if you want to travel in an other dimension and in an other time , go to watch this movie , it is just the best around .",Apocalypto
355,mrsOGB,Great movie.,10,1 November 2012,"I really enjoyed this movie. I don't know how accurate this movie is and I really don't care. It has a good story line, characters that you care about and great action sequences. Who cares if they use some modern words? I'm sure that even back then the meaning behind it was understood. Say what you want about Mel, he is a great director. I don't agree with his rantings and ravings, but he does put out some great movies. This is definitely a movie I would watch more than a couple of times. It's no Braveheart, but still good. There were a lot of cool scenes and it was interesting to see some of the past come to life. This is the kind of movie you need patience for.",Apocalypto
356,pantera1,Apocalypto then,9,30 January 2007,"""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.""  W. Durant No one can accuse Mel G of taking the easy way out; in his personal or directorial life. In his personal life he's known as an alcoholic who likes to jump off the wagon and into his SUV once too often, with various choice epithets and slurs along the way. He's graduated from acting pretty boy charmer roles into more meaty, personal choices in his acting, producing and finally directing ones.His directorial debut was with THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE (8/10); an uneasy film about a relationship between a disfigured man and a boy with uncomfortable undertones.His next was the anti-British diatribe BRAVEHEART(6/10) with non-optional torture scenes . Which was just the prelude to THE PASSION OF THE Christ; A cinematographically gorgeous film which I just couldn't watch.Well, if you're at all squeamish, give APOCALYPTO a miss. While not as constantly graphic as POTC, it still hits pretty hard. These stunt boys deserved their pay.It's basically the story of various tribes with their various cultures and sub-cultures; the initial hunter-gatherer tribe which lives within the confines of it's family unit and the larger more industrialized city based ""civilized"" one, with the lack of personal interactions and cohesiveness leading to a new Sodom and Gomorrah.It's filmed in a mixture of high definition digital video and film, giving an uneasy mix of the two at times. The Video is used in a lot of the fight/action scenes for a greater sense of immediacy. (Apart from some of Soderbergh's follies, the highest profile film to use High definition video recently was COLLATERAL (9/10).It works on many levels; as a tale of differences and changes in societies, an adventure story, a story of love and determination. Sure, there are some nit-picking historical inaccuracies but take it as artistic license.Filmed in a Mayan dialect with English subtitles, it brings a lot of humanity to peoples that we wouldn't ordinarily watch. It makes us care. And the magic is he brings humanity and an understanding to both main protagonists. After an initial, necessary , slower introduction, it picks up pace and never lets up. The acting is superb; with none of the actors being even close to a household name in the English speaking film world.it is a travesty that it wasn't nominated in the best foreign language Oscar category, but I guess the main backing was from within the US, thus disqualifying it.But I'm sure it Mayan win a couple of other awards",Apocalypto
357,folkie-imdb,Could have been great,4,20 April 2007,"This movie could have been great. It takes itself very, very seriously, yet it's somewhat less realistic than Raiders of the Lost Arc. It's beautifully photographed, the sets and costumes are amazing, the action is well choreographed, the film is well paced and yet...this film really didn't work for me because the main character suddenly becomes superhuman. Mel Gibson just went a little too far, too often. In a film like ""300"", which I really enjoyed, the characters are fairly superhuman too, but not so much as the lead character in Apocalypto. And in ""300"", the filmmakers don't try to flip back and forth between down to earth, normal life, and superhuman exploits. If you want to stay serious, you must stay on theme. In ""First Blood"", also very serious, the hero's exploits are impressive and improbable, but still believable. I didn't believe what the hero in this show was getting away with, nor did I believe in his pursuers.",Apocalypto
358,Dragon_Eye_Morrison,Oh Mel...,4,21 October 2011,"If ""The Passion"" was a display of the symptoms of a serious mental illness, Apocalypto reflects Mel's juvenile hollow side as a director. It's really hard to tell what this movie is suppose to be: an action movie, a history lesson or some kind of spiritual journey of sorts? It fails at any of them, as an action movie is dumb and full of lame clichés, as a ""history lesson"" the less we talk about it the better, as a ""spiritual"" journey, i don't think the term even applies. Finally, is not an engaging movie, it takes itself way too seriously, when it's almost impossible to take anything seriously here. Just like the Passion it will numb your senses instead of stimulating them in any way possible. From it's one dimensional characters to the constant use of predictable action clichés.A pointless movie on all fronts, better just watch the history channel to see the goofy guy with the goofy hair talking about how everything has no logic explanation, therefore, aliens!",Apocalypto
359,xander34,Gibson Strikes Back,8,11 December 2006,"It's safe to say that only Mel Gibson could have made Apocalypto. No other director would have been able to gather enough funding to produce a film with mostly non-actors in a Mayan dialect. Yet for Gibson, this isn't a problem. He has enough money to make whatever he desires after the great commercial success of The Passion of The Christ, and he's probably the most bankable director out there. Because Gibson directed it, people are interested. If another director made Apocalypto, it wouldn't even get a major theatrical release.The resulting film ends up breaking new cinematic ground, mostly due to the risks Gibson took. Like with Paul Greengrass's United 93, the unknown cast helps transport the viewer into the ancient Mayan world that is Apocalypto. Most of the acting in the film isn't perfect, however the use of an arcane language masks most of this. The only standout of the cast is Rudy Youngblood, who plays the main character, Jaguar Paw.Gibson also takes risks in his visual choices, including shooting the film entirely on a high definition camera. The decision to shoot on this digital format was not one of frugality. Gibson had the time and money to shoot on film, which creates softer, more elegant pictures. However, it becomes apparent that Gibson wanted to recreate the atmosphere of the Mayan kingdom in a realistic way. Apocalypto's Academy Award winning director of photography, Dean Semler (Dances with Wolves), made high definition completely emulate film in this summer's blockbuster Click. Yet strangely, the look of Apocalypto is a far cry from the appearance of celluloid. The motion of the camera feels more like a documentary than a film, and the colors look uncorrected and truer to life. Frequent movie-goers will notice this jarring difference on the big screen at first, but it really does add a unique look to the movie, and is fairly easy to get used to.After a relatively slow yet surprisingly comedic first act, the pacing of Apocalypto accelerates so quickly that the movie feels a half an hour shorter than it actually is (the actual running time is 138 minutes). The last act is basically an extended chase scene containing Jaguar Paw trying to escape his impending sacrifice by the hands of the brutal Mayan Kingdom. In addition, reports of the array of violence are not entirely true. There is some violence, but the sadistic nature of the violence shown will make the faint of heart squirm. Summaries of Apocalypto mention the film is about the decline of the Mayan civilization. This is entirely misleading. There are a few scattered references and metaphors to the kingdom's demise, but the real story ends up being more intimate than that. It essentially becomes a man fleeing his fate of death to save himself and his family.Apocalypto is a daring, creative cinematic achievement, as well as an audience pleasing thriller by one of Hollywood's most controversial filmmakers.",Apocalypto

363,brad_and_ethan,Better than The Patriot or The Passion...,7,28 January 2007,"Mel Gibson has finally made something fairly admirable. Whereas in The Passion, where all the violence went for naught and was incredibly gratuitous, here it is put into a much better context. The scenes in the Mayan city, with the leaders taking advantage of the solar eclipse via bloodletting - are very sobering. Now you know how Americans got duped into invading Iraq, i.e., smoke and mirrors. The Mayans did foretell their own demise, so the film has a nice coda with the coming of the Spanish ships. There isn't anything terribly deep here. The film doesn't really delve into Mayan culture, philosophy, or their incredibly prophetic calendar. What it does offer is basically a chase movie with high production values. The only thing that really bothered me was the little girl and her prophecies. Are we led to believe that this was the village shaman, and by her illness she's able to foretell everything? Oh well, nothing's perfect...",Apocalypto
364,noloxtreme,Another World we knew nothing About.,10,17 June 2007,"This movie left me amazed. In my opinion it is one of the best films of all time. Some reviewers here have criticized the film for being historically inaccurate. To those reviewers I say, if you don't like the film, why don't you watch another film about the 15th century Mayans................. Oh wait, I remember. There aren't any. You'll find many films about England, and France, and Austria. And some other Eurocentric Epic, but hardly anything about any other Civilization in the world, and for them to knock a Director that actually had a little vision, to make a movie about another part of the world is disappointing. Its easy to get on the Mel Gibson hate bandwagon.But, back to the film.Visually stunning. I felt like I was part of the adventure, incredibly stunning camera work. The acting? The actors weren't acting as Mayans, they became Mayans. Every single performance was convincing.The Violence? First of All, I couldn't finish watching Sin City simply because it glorified senseless violence and I hate senseless violence, and yet its on the top 100 list-go figure. This is not the case with Apocalypto, the movie is about people that were abducted to be SACRIFICED, gee, I guess there won't be blood, or violence. I happen to think it was used appropriately.//SPOILERS Purpose of Film? Someone said this film is meaningless. This is not accurate. Opening quote: ""Before a civilization is destroyed without, its destroyed within"". The Film is about a Society that has become Depraved. A society that had become so corrupt, and insensitive, human life become worthless. Historically inaccurate? I think not, Aztecs, Canaanites, Carthagians,etc, etc. Again, something Never explored in films.Finally, Hope. Never giving up.End of Old era, New Beginnings.All in All, this Film is groundbreaking. People are always complaining about Hollywood being predictable. When a movie breaking new ground appears, its booed off the stage.;-)",Apocalypto
365,Matchstick,Rudy Youngblood sells this movie.,8,10 December 2006,"Yep. Just saw it tonight and I'll tell you what; despite the Polish dude next to me translating ad naseum every word to his girlfriend, it was a great flick.I like this kid Rudy Youngblood. He's a virtual unknown but he plays it well. Hell, I like him better that Andrew Wyeth or Socrates. I want him to either run the U.N. or become a commander of a U.S. Aircraft Carrier. Seriously though, he play the part well, and though it's not very heady in the speech department, he holds his own in expressions and physical feats. Gibson....hey look, I'm not an anti-semite and I could care less for what he said when he was drunk...I've said crazy meaningless and hateful stuff when I was drunk, who cares. People are too PC these days; it's sickening anyway, give the cat a break, he made a great movie here, give him his propers. This is the kind of movie Hollywood should be making more of. You know what though, the violence is over-rated. It's not too bad. If you kind of like the violence angle, the best comes when the 60 minute chase scene comes up and our boy Rudy gets into the thick of the jungle. He starts to go Rambo on the hunting tribe's asses when he is in his neck of the forest and it starts to be a combo of ""First Blood"" and Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" (no pun, but that was kind of clever lol). Like I said, I personally, I think the gore and violence is overrated, but I wouldn't take my kid to see this. Gosh no. Visually, it's stunning. This must have been a fantastically hard movie to make from the set designers perspective. Mel made a very good movie and it's no dud, absolutely worth a view!",Apocalypto

The film is engaging, you get interested from the begining to the end, because the story but even more because the powerful visuals, depiction of the characters and use of the camera.There are three segments in the film. First, the village and main character are portrayed in a hunt scene. Even with the joy and family comfort of the scenes, blood appears. I got surprised by the scene after the couple that was trying to ""conceive"" a child. They have been deceived with some leaves that they should use to improve the chances of pregnancy, the guy had to rub them into his sexual organs, and in reality the leaves sparked a hot or spicy feeling. The guy leaves the hut trying to put his sexual organs in water, but the girl tried to refresh her mouth.Second segment is the invasion by the Mayans, how they are guided to the Mayan city and the sacrifices there.Third and last part of the movie, is the run away of the main character and final fight with the persecutors.",Apocalypto
367,deletewindowson,Terrifying Look At State Terrorism,1,14 January 2013,"SPOILER ALERT! Don't Read This! It seems that all ancient agricultural societies went through a period of state terrorism. Usually this is expressed as religious ritual involving human sacrifice, torture, and slaughter of lower classes. Actually of course from a political perspective it is always the actions of a tiny parasitic aristocratic minority extracting surplus and maintaining power by terrorizing the people below them in the social pyramid. Okay, that being said, this flick demonstrates that in some rather grotesque and frightening ways. The Bad Guys here are truly horrible and evil.. and look it! The Good Guy, young Jaguar Paw, is the Noble Savage persecuted by the ""civilization"" next door from whence issue the state terrorists who prey upon the forest dwellers. He gets away. Thank god because I'm so fed up with nihilistic films where everyone dies in the end and evil triumphs. However, this is the spoiler part: Jag's wife and son are down in a hole. Jag is being chased by a gang of killers. He's got to save his wife and son from drowning in the hole. He ""takes out"" ie kills all but two of the Bad Guys who are chasing him. However he gets shot in the chest with an arrow.. which he manfully breaks off. Meanwhile, down in the hole, neck deep in water with her young son on her shoulders, and precariously perched on a small rock to keep her head above the water, Mrs Paw gives birth to an infant! Jag shows up. I'm wondering how is he going to get his wife, his son, and a newborn infant out of this deep hole (at least 20 feet deep and rapidly filling with water!) when he is--or should be--on the verge of death with an arrow embedded in his chest? CUT! What? Yeah, cut. Next scene shows the little family--Dad somehow recovered and somehow having gotten his brood out of the hole--pausing before heading off to safety in the jungle. HOW DID THEY GET OUT OF THE HOLE? HOW DID HE RECOVER FROM AN ARROW IN HIS CHEST? Ha ha! No answer to that. Gibson thinks we are so stupid we won't wonder about it. Just.. magic I guess.

After the fiasco of a Religious Snuff Film that is his ""The Passion,"" Apocalypto is a very captivating and unavoidable seriously glorious film! From beginning to end the film is really quite watchable and never even once lets up on its relentless and quite emotional pace! There were a few scenes that i found a bit predictable, but on the whole it brings a fresh and vibrant, if pretty violent, tone to this story of passion and redemption! There are many parallel lines to be drawn between the modern morally and emotionally bankrupt society that we all find ourselves in, and the single minded and ruthless theocracy of the Mayan age, but this movie doesn't spend any time preaching... just showing! I personally was always rooting for the lead character of the story, and and as far as i am concerned, quite rightly so! He is young, but not fool-hardy. Emotional, but not irrational, Down to earth, but quite willing to change with the circumstances! And let there be no doubt, the world around him, and the society in which he lives is changing... in many big ways!

372,Author_Poet_Aberjhani,The Triumph of Apocalypto,10,20 January 2008,"The ancient civilization of the Mayans as presented in Mel Gibson's APOCALYPTO, from mountainous pyramids to detailed ceremonial masks and a field of headless bodies, comes across as so fantastically authentic that it feels like you're watching a reality TV show from 12 centuries ago. This otherworldly realism, if one can describe it as such, comes from more than just the fine-line details cultivated throughout this triumphant film. It also comes from the kind of simple and more extraordinary contrasts that make real life in any era what it is. In this case, the contrasts are between the more urbanized Mayans and the easy-going forest people-- in more modern terms kind of like city folks and country folks. The use of contrast also works with scenes of gentle humor set against scenes of heart-pounding action, leaving no time or space for dull moments.Gibson's gift as a filmmaker (and writer) seems to be an uncanny ability to demonstrate profound spiritual principles through entertaining dramatic action. It is something he does extremely well in ""Apocalypto"" as the young hero of the film, Jaguar Paw, is forced to abandon his expectant wife and toddler son in an attempt to fight off Mayan invaders. Failing in that attempt, Jaguar Paw is forced to confront his own fears and physical weaknesses before he can claim the inner strength and renewal of self needed for a chance at victory. He seems to personify the old saying, ""There's no rest for the weary."" After surviving getting shot through by arrows, he finds himself literally on the run, moving as hard, fast, and painfully determined as he can through crops, dead bodies, jungles, waterfalls, trees, and tar pits. Newcomer Rudy Youngblood tackles the role of Jaguar Paw with real heart and it's impossible not to cheer him on in one scene after another. Likewise when it comes to Dalia Hernandez as his wife Seven. What she does as she holds one baby on her shoulders while bringing another into the world is something that would cause most men to faint just thinking about it.Along with ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion of Christ,"" ""Apocalypto"" places Gibson among those movie makers who effectively employ film to deliver exceptional entertainment while simultaneously exploring the intriguing profundities of history. In the course of doing so, he manages to communicate quite a lot about the cultural traditions and spiritual beliefs that have brought humanity this far along its collective journey. ""Apocalypto"" in particular also says a lot about what makes us tick, and endure, as individuals.by Author-Poet Aberjhani, author of ""The Bridge of Silver Wings""",Apocalypto
373,nicolovvassil,Do some research before writing a negative review!,7,14 March 2008,"I liked the movie and before writing a review I read only negative comments on IMDb to see why people hated the film.Most of them claim that the movie is historically incorrect,based on false facts.Here are two arguments of the haters of the movie:1.The Mayans didn't make human sacrifices and didn't rip off the hearts of the victims.That is something the Aztecs did.2.The Spaniards arrived 500 years later.OK, I didn't know if that was true so I decided to take 20-30 min. of my time and do some research on the internet.And guess what!!It turns out that Mel Gibson did his homework right and those who write the hate it reviews didn't!The Mayans DID make human sacrifices, they DID rip off the hearts of their victims, they were no better than the Aztecs. They began with human sacrificing about 300 A.D.This is a fact known since 1973(the year scientists managed to encrypt the Mayan hieroglyphs).Besides:who sais that the bad guys in the film are too Mayans?!!They may be Aztecs or Toltecs!The Aztecs were at that time at the peak of their civilization, their territories went deep into the south.""The Spaniards arrived 500 years later"" You really don't know when the movie takes place until the end when the conquistadors show up.Then we see, aha: the year is 1511 + something.Is this possible?Why not?The end of the great Mayan civilization was about 900 A.D. After that we have the post classic period until 1511 (the year of the arrival of Cortes).Gibson doesn't claim that the occurrence's in the film take place in the early Mayan history.To all the haters of the film who have a problem with not presenting the great achievements of that culture(mathematics, astrology an so on):That was BEFORE the happenings in the movie!And besides, that was not the story of the movie.Not showing the greatness of the culture doesn't mean that Gibson denies it! ""The Mayans were presented as savages"" - that is because they were(check out their rituals), or what is your definition of a savage?There is another moment in the film:the bad guy threatens Jaguar Paw he would skin him alive and then wear his skin.I first thought, well that was original of Gibson, but then I found out on the internet that skinning your enemies and wearing their skin was an ACTUAL RITUAL of the Mayans.Yes they were savages, and I don't care how many Mexicans(who think they are the legacy of the Mayans, which they are not) feel offended by this movie.Another point is the gore in the film.After reading some reviews I noticed that people who liked ""The passion of the Christ"" have a problem with the gore in this movie...Excuse me!?!!So you don't have problems watching the Romans beat the crap out of Jesus but mind some Mayan heads being cut off!My recommendation to all who want to write a negative review: make some research before doing so!That is the only way to find out how much truth there is in this film!I, for example found also out that they were using exact the same type of weapons at that time, like knifes made of obsidian. I would also recommend to see this film along with another great film:The Mission(1986).If you liked ""Apocalypto"" and want to see a true story about what happened next, you should see ""The Mission"".If you saw ""Apocalypto"" and hated it, ""The Mission"" will make you fell better. Yes, I agree that Mr. Gibson is a Christian fanatic, but unlike many others I wouldn't interpret the ending as pro-Christian.Why?Because there was a priest on a boat?The film is not perfect though.Mr. Gibson, if you want to make a realistic movie, you have to stick to this idea the whole way:No human is faster than a puma!There were hundreds of beheaded bodies in that pit, that was too much to be believed!The little girl having the plague(!!!where did that come from?) and making prophecies was also unbelievable.But this is still a movie! And in my opinion it deserves 7 stars for being good but not special.",Apocalypto
374,vmarthirial,Primitive entertainment,8,10 December 2006,"Just saw the film and it was a very well executed narrative of a snapshot of pre-Columbian native life and struggle in Mezoamerica, nothing else. Although dealing with a population of rather scant complexity, Mr. Giibson is able to give a meaningful depth to the characters, without loosing the primitivism of their life. I liked that, it cut off any romanticism or imposed modernism for sake of cinematic embellishment.The plot is simple, predictable and in times tedious, but the abundance of gore, rainforest persecutions and wild attacks (by animals and warriors alike) keeps the film at good pace. The script is very tight, fast and well executed, leaving no loose ends and even a very interesting mixing of events at the end.I heard many things about the propensity of Mr. Gibson to expose the viewer to grotesque trauma shots with microscopic detail. Such device offers, in this environment, story and times, a unique appeal that will not be repulsive (as in the Passion of the Christ) because here, both enemy and victim belong to the same circle of life, death, survival and dominion, carefully balanced by the director and masterfully played by the actors.Highly recommended if you are interested in seeing the primitive aspect of beings without antiseptic story-telling.",Apocalypto

Seek not for that which you cannot fathom and you will be content to live a life ruled by what surrounds you. Asking answers to a question you do not understand is the way that leads ever downward, and is how this story begins and ends.Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his father Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead) have lived in this forest and have hunted in this forest for generations and hope to for generations to come. The small village they belong to has nothing to want for and they want for nothing. Both father and son manage the tribe and its warriors with a sense of humor that masks a calm demeanor and a slow fire.The film begins with Jaguar Paws village being attacked by religious fanatics and fire. Led by an emotionless warrior, Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), the arriving force believes that they must capture as many people as necessary to appease the vengeful gods that they worship.Jaguar Paw and his village are taken on a journey across the forest and to the base of zealotry to confront their fate. At the pinnacle of conflict destiny intervenes and releases Jaguar Paw from purported death.With fate on his side he turns the tide of control decidedly. Taking those that would oppress him and leading them into his own territory. Trickery, revenge, and confidence give Jaguar Paw what he needs to reclaim his independence. Those that thought to take it from him learn this lesson slowly but surely.Apocalypto is not so much about the story that it unfolds but rather the emotion that is evoked from the incredible cast it showcases. Its lack of a stimulating plot does not detract from the film in fact I believe that it helps the film understand itself better. The imagery and characters involved all add to the powerful themes of family, honor and fearlessness the movie exudes.Ignore that which you fear so that you might attain that which is unattainable.",Apocalypto
376,robertmike57,"This Movie is ""Die Hard"" of the Mayans",4,7 August 2007,"Or should I say ""Aztecs"", as there was no Mayan civilization in 1520, as we are shown at the end of the movie with Spanish conquistadors coming ashore.I believe Gibson's first priority was making a commerically successful movie, certainly a challenge given the subject matter of Mayans in pre Columbia America. The problem I have with the movie claiming to give a historically accurate representation, but delivering a story with a 2006 plot and characters.""Super cool"" weapons are contrived and used in a manner you would not see them used in pre Columbian America. The DVD extra shows how proud the technical people were of the craft of making their awesome arrows, maces, etc. That is made abundantly clear at the start as a super cool weapon REALLY kills a Tapir at the beginning of the movie. So much for the realism that was supposed to be presented.21st century western civilization views and action are merely projected onto 16th century native Americans. The movie starts off with: 1. Peaceful village is raided and destroyed by bad guys. 2. Bad guys ritualistically slaughter villagers in their city 3. A villager escapes and is pursued by a huge gang of bad guys who have a staggering array of weapons. The bad guys are killed off in different and colorful ways throughout the rest of the movie while trying to kill the escaped villager who is also trying to save his family. All of which is done is a sprint and quick swim in a ""jungle"" that must be more like a woods with little a svegetation. In other words, its the same story as Die Hard. A story of trying to depict a mindset of people from that place and time is simply not here. If you expect nothing more than a mindless comic book style action movie , then the Mayan language is a distraction and not needed for showing an exotic locale.

This movie really engulfed me in its world, took me back years when my imagination was vivid when i read about ancient civilizations in South America. It depicts what might have been, could have been based on current psychological assessments of man. It relates to current politics and wars in away that it captures the essence of it and simple basics of it. Its a story that is meant to present a perspective and i think it has brilliantly done so, novel in every way, and i don't care about the controversy behind it or its creator.

378,Sophoclaw,Very revealing about the authors devils.,1,8 August 2010,"Perhaps no intentionally, the story has attributes to the glorifying of non conceptual and unhistorical events in the past. The plot feels empty because there is absolutely no development for the events one is looking at the screen. The necessary processes that a good story has are unfortunately missing. We can see that something very dramatic is happening because of the expression and movement of the actors, but it is very difficult to have any identification with them in a manuscript without background, especially in a film that is depicting events from the past and from a culture that is relatively unknown for the majority of the film goers. The film takes for granted in an unusually remarkable way the stories told by the conquerors and colonizers of the ethnic Americans. One can only wonder how a film made by a non colonizer and non catholic would be. Certainly much more truthful and not so biased. To conclude: the film is boring because it is a complete invention from start to end and has nothing to do with Native America. Better and more exciting films about America will come.",Apocalypto
379,Intacto,Cracking Adventure Film !,8,9 January 2007,"Cracking good film, I was expecting from its overtly Pretentious title, A film with wider issues with a resonance and philosophical slant on the demise of Mayan Civilisation,, But this was simply a bold, and frenetic Boys Own' adventure about a warrior called Jaguar Paw . ( Was it just me or does he have a a striking resemblance to Ronaldino) , being chased through the Jungle by some seriously scary blokes with bad teeth , to save his Wife and kids !!!! Sheer Escapism with touches of Predator, The fugitive, Deliverance, Conan the Barbarian, Tarzan, The Mission, Gladiator and the National Geographic Channel. Forget those prudes who have slated the violence,, why don't you go and watch ' Miss Potter ' instead , I found the violence most involving and no less gratuitous than from your average episode of Taggert.. Knowing Gibson was at the helm is enough to create excitement and trepidation of impending doom and his graphic realisation never disappointed !!!!

I think that what the film is doing, is to present those societies violent enough to impress us (the modern viewers).I think that for the big majority is obvious that the film is not based on true facts, but also I think that it doesn't trying to represent those people as savages. What it tries to do is to present them as more... interesting.This movie doesn't have any racial motivation. This conclusion is just an unreasonable ""conspiracy theory"".",Apocalypto

Fairly basic in plot - lots of running through the forest and being chased - though it seemed to end at the right moment. Interesting take on Mayan civilisation from within. See it in the cinema for its interesting photography. Be prepared for subtitles.One minor sub-plot involving a 'prophecy' slightly annoyed me - it seemed too supernatural for the story.

382,strumdatjag,"Surprise! Mel's Stunning, Exciting Adventure",9,10 December 2006,"In 1915, D.W. Griffith became the controversial filmmaker of his day with the release of ""The Birth of a Nation"" (10/10, despite its offensive plot where the Klan were portrayed as heroes). Griffith pumped all of his profits from that film into one of the great epic films of all time ""Intolerance"" (10/10). Griffith took a risk in doing something new, intertwining multiple stories into one film. Now, I won't say that Mel Gibson has created a ""classic"" equal to ""Intolerance"". However, ""Apocalyto"" is a tremendous, visually stunning cinematic achievement. Mel took a tremendous risk in creating this gripping, adventure story about Central American Indians. There is no target audience I can think of. Cinematically, it's done with a Hollywood flair for suspense. The acting neophytes in cast succeed with the help of great camera-work (and great direction and coaching from Mel). Getting these non-actors to be this good is n achievement in itself. At times, Mel does give in to his curious obsession with ultraviolent torture and mayhem. Yet, it is not as inappropriate as the overlong torture-fest at the end of ""Braveheart (9/10) or nearly throughout the gorefilled entirety of ""The Passion of the Drunk-drivin' Antisemitic"" (5/10). Don't let your biases regarding Mel keep you away. This isn't an all-time classic, but it is certainly one of the best movies that I have seen this mostly lackluster year (2006). I know, Mel thinks there's some big meaning behind this story - some supposed parallel to what he sees as today's decadent culture. Yet, if you go looking for some great philosophical meaning, I suspect you'll be disappointed. If you want an exhilarating, suspenseful, well-crafted ride to somewhere cinematically new, go see this!!!!! See it on the biggest screen you can find.",Apocalypto
383,philipbyrner,An absolute Cracker to the highest degree,10,8 January 2007,"I judge films on entertainment quality and with this in mind i would class this film as one of the most entertaining films of this generation. Its an edge of the seat film from start to finish. This film not only toys with everybody's emotions who see it but also gets inside even the most unadventurous people to such an extent the hairs on the back of your neck will stand up. Mel Gibson has just proved that he is one of the best directors around. The only comparable director at the moment is Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg is lagging behind in todays era. He has had his moments with some brilliant films but lets face it now we know thats there's competition out there. But anyway this review is about this film so ill talk about it. I want to talk about it without spoiling it so ill keep this short and sweet. The main great points about this film are as follows. - The actors and there acting. These are not known actors which i think should be the sign of a good film. How can a film be believable if Tom Cruise is a lead actor, for example. Tom cruise in mission impossible, how can he be a secret agent if he's already the last samarai? This shows intelligence in a film where the director doesn't need known actors to boost tickets, scripts and story lines should boost tickets. - The storyline. This film didn't focus on the actual events of the Mayan civilization being wiped out but more to the point of tribes within the Mayan civilization fighting and taking over other tribes within. This story happens just before the race of people were apparently wiped out by outsiders. The idea of this was brilliant and Mel didn't want to get into the exact history of what happened, if he did then he could highlight faults and that wouldn't be good.All in all this is definitely a cinema film, such an adrenalin rush from start to finish that i would recommend viewing to everyone. Even my girlfriend loved it and she normally only likes chick flicks.",Apocalypto

(mind you that i have watched it only once).Mel had put a great effort into creating a real world, he virtually built the civilization all over again. perfection in this movie reached the smallest of things, including beautifully detailed tattoos and accessories.the cast did a great job, very convincing, especially when they don't talk !! what annoyed me most was reading the subtitles instead of purely enjoying the scenery. and i must say, there were some times were i wondered why am i watching this movie.finally, the movie is perfect in every way. it has a very good message, and absolutely worth watching in the cinema. i hope a very good blue ray of this movie will be available by mid next year.",Apocalypto

I was so happy to discover that the villains were in fact the Aztecs, and I was glad that they didn't hold back on there monstorous way of life. The Mayans were interesting enough, all though I personally don't like the piercings they have on various parts of there body. The movie sort of tricks you into who the main character is, even if you read the synopsis you still might think it could be debatable. The action is great, the scenery is amazing and the ending is satisfying , all though I thought there'd be a little more to it. It's sort of similar to 10,000 BC, so if you liked that then this might appeal to you as well.",Apocalypto
386,brentsoffcenter,Another fine Gibson film based on historical events,8,9 December 2006,"Almost everything about this film was excellent. The direction, the story, the believability, the research behind the story, the photographic composition and general cinematography were all absolutely excellent. Gibson continues to be a top notch director, especially in terms of the realism of human behavior under vicious and savage circumstances. Although part of a familiar formula, and used several times in past Gibson efforts, this film adds a new dimension in drama, based on the social behaviors of a more ancient and distant civilization. If there was any flaw at all, it would simply be in the unavoidable context of predictability and the preconditioning of the audience for the inevitable tragic story to follow.The fellowship and kinship of the village; the kidding and practical joking among the village's band of hunters; the playing on the warm fuzzy humanity of the children and parents of the village, and so on, are all part of an introduction to wring out emotions of compassion and sympathy for the small village's people. What was about to happen was somewhat predictable. But then, that predictability is probably unavoidable. There are just so many story formulas available.In addition to being a gripping adventure, the story was also a good depiction and illustration of the social upheaval in a period of the history of the Mayan culture. This is not to say that it was depicted with one hundred percent historical accuracy. This was a movie based on fact; it was not a documentary, nor was it intended as one.It should also be pointed out, because of who the director of this film is, that there is a great deal of negative publicity and review written about it. Much of this negativism sounds more like jealousy, revenge, sour grapes, and pettiness, than it does about film analysis. In looking at many of the reviews, it seems that most of the negative criticism of this film has come from one sector: one proportionally small, but very loud, section of one cultural community. Yes, the movie did contain the inevitable violence, no question about it. And yes, Mr. Gibson has a flair for leaving nothing to the imagination in terms of depicting what gruesome acts and savagery are committed by man against man. But these scenes were necessary in order to tell the story accurately.Did we hear as loud a criticism about violence and gore regarding ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Flags Of Our Fathers"", or the recent ""Departed""? Although these are a few examples of movies that contained even more graphic violence and realism, we did not. And the reason we haven't heard unwarranted criticism about these, and others, is simply that the directors of those examples are not as controversial. In other words, Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood did not blunder into political incorrectness while talking with a police officer. And if they ever had accidentally said something carelessly, the media wasn't around at the time to exploit the mistake.All said and done, this was a superb film. It is one that will be counted as one of Mel Gibson's finest efforts, and also as one of the better movies in the history of film making.",Apocalypto

The mystical element could really have been dropped all together from my point of view.The chase through the jungle makes me think of free-running in it's ""native"" environment. Excellently shot, the story really gets behind and in the characters (I'm a big fan of Mel Gibson's willingness to go the whole way with his vision and not hold back).

It was far too violent. We get it already. I was still OK. BIG SPOILER!!!Towards the end of the movie, the wife of Jaguar Paw (Jaguar Paw? Yeah, that's Mayan.) is dumped in a cave.

To depict the Mayan Civilization as the driving factor of the story, I felt, was inappropriate. I would have thought the Mayan were more civilized, larger and advanced. Thus, as I watched the movie, it became more and more incredulous. Ultimately, I resigned to the fact that the movie was just out to get our ticket fare. Fortunately it gets less gore towards the end and looked more like a John Woo's movie. The very last piece about the crusaders was also another irrelevant piece.",Apocalypto

391,keith-73,A stunning achievement-- highly recommend this movie!,9,17 December 2006,"I rated this film a 9. Nothing is a 10, nothing is a 1, and 9's as high as I can go with any film. Unlike the overblown FX / CGI extravaganzas of LORD OF THE RINGS or the STAR WARS films (9 films I have never written a user comment for), Mel Gibson's stunning achievement with APOCALYPTO is virtually beyond compare.It crafts a story so simple as to be almost Homeric in it's telling. It is said that many ""native"" people use a vivid and compelling ""oral history"", stories that are passed down from one generation to another, very much like the character in this film, Old Story Teller. That is the feel and texture of this movie.Set during the final days of the great Mayan empire, starting out in the vast jungles, we meet a group of villagers who live in a world of tranquil serenity. This is not a Hollywood version, where everyone seems to have good teeth, sleep well, shave often and have plenty of makeup for the babes. These are ""natives"" and Gibson doesn't shy back from the warts and all feel of the place.But they are a simple people (not simple minded) with simple needs. Enter the bad guys-- in this case a raiding party of Mayan's (we find this out later) who capture as many able bodied villagers as they can, killing only those they have to, even to the point of abandoning the kids under 12, since they have no value at the slave market back at the main city.Our hero has hidden his pregnant woman and their son down a dry well (or some sort of hole in the ground) promising to return-- only to be captured and imprisoned with the others.The trek out of the village to the big city is spectacular! The scope of the film broadens to epic proportions, as visual as the old Biblical flicks of the 50's and 60's. Gibson has out done the PASSION OF THE Christ scope here-- truly, a cast of thousands! And not Orks or Robots or Clones! These are people-- period dress, caste system, beggars and prostitutes, kings and queens, slave dealers, lepers-- an incredible film-- and all seen through the eyes of our hero! I highly recommend this film! This is not as bloody or as gory as the critics would have you believe! It is grisly-- that's a fact! But the context of the blood letting is all in the story-- in fact, I'd say this: in my opinion, there is not one drop of gratuitous blood in this whole movie.Also, and bet your bottom dollar on this-- thank God for Mel Gibson and his independent streak! Hollywood would never have made this movie! The first thing you notice is the good guys and the bad guys, the women and the kids-- an not one single homage to old school Hollywood with the slick productions values, perfect makeup and big busted ""white girls"" playing the Mayan queen or princess or some such hooey! You can taste the attention to detail here! Throwaway scenes that must have cost millions of dollars to recreate-- and they get 30 or 50 seconds of screen time! This truly makes me anticipate the next Mel Gibson film. He has reached a level of story telling here that has no equal. A perfect example of what a true artist can do when he (or she) doesn't have to kiss the a** of the studio exec's! APOCALYPTO-- 9 out of 10-- an excellent film!",Apocalypto

I mean Jaguar pawn lives a bucolic life in a community in the outskirts of a Hollywood made Mayan civilization, he and his entire village is wiped out by slave hunters, but leaves behind trapped his pregnant wife and his son, They travel through the jungle they find a prophet with smallpox (that comes a few centuries later with Spaniards) they arrive in a Mayan city where they are to be offered as sacrifices to Kukulkan to ease the drought (wrong deity) but he is spared because of an eclipse (Mayans and Aztecs were able to predict them) then they decide to get rid of them using the as target practice ( I believe Nazis did that on WWII) the in the most pure Rambo- Predator style Jaguar paw avoid spears, arrows, jaguars (that is a panther, jaguars are smaller)and all sorts of obstacles followed by the slave hunters that must have been using a GPS tracker or something like that the end is predictable.",Apocalypto
393,fredman5555,"Was there a ""real"" point to this film?",6,8 December 2006,"""Apocalypto"" is an... interesting... movie to say the least! I just finished watching it a little over three hours ago, and I'm still not sure what I thought.On the one hand, it had non-stop action, but at the same time, it left one wondering what the action was all about. It's not necessarily the kind of action to which we can relate. Of course, the scenery was gorgeous, but the plot line took eons to reveal itself.The thing is, I feel Mel Gibson's become a bit flaky in more recent days. It seems his last few films have had to become crusades of some sort. Unto itself, that's not all bad. The trouble is, these crusades take on his contorted version of reality, and in this particular ""reality,"" we would be led to believe Mayan civilization ultimately fell due to corruptness and an extreme lack of morality.While it is true that I have seen a small grouping of similar, cataclysmic reviews making points parallel to those implied in this film, I have read far more Mayan scholars and seen far more archaeological evidence such as bones and settlement remains that contradict this viewpoint. For example, some of these other pieces show how many Mayan citizens from the lowly peasants up to the important priests were anemic and likely died from complications of anemia.Expansion and erosion remains show rapid growth had occurred in latter years with over-farming and subsequent erosion as the result. These are recognized huge problems from the times not long before the grand-scale downfalls.Admittedly, these elements don't make a very interesting movie, and Apocalypto WAS interesting; however, I see it as irresponsible to imply otherwise and to additionally imply, through this movie, that our civilization might just be on the same downward path for the same reasons. Perhaps I missed the mark, but I believe the film's late credit reference to, ""In Memory of Abel,"" was a reference to a certain Christian biblical story where a personal downfall came about through a similar lack of morals (a lack directly seen and implied in Apocalypto).Watch this movie for entertainment value or, better yet, spend your time on something else!",Apocalypto

397,LesHalles,I hope this is the worst review of all. :),1,26 March 2007,"As an action film, it was simplistic and predictable.As cinematography, the glorious rain-forest never looked so boring.For entertainment, I would look elsewhere.But the reason I hope this is the worst review of all is that I believe the message the film programs into the minds of viewers is a slander to the Native Americans, and a deceptive version of history destructive to world peace.The Mayans are portrayed as savages and their priests as hypocritical mass murderers, deceiving the people for power. The exaggerated caricature of the Mayan priests is absurd propaganda. The idea that human sacrifice was a means to control the population is, as far as I know, pure speculation, and it doesn't make much sense. A scapegoat has to be portrayed as a villain, and the humans sacrificed were considered sacred offerings if not divine themselves.The truth is that the Mayans never sacrificed humans on the scale of the Aztecs, which seem to be the model for the film. There is rich evidence of a powerful, peaceful spiritual religious tradition in Mesoamerica. The pre-Columbian Mexican religions had ideals of worship and love for the God who had created the world and provided for humanity. They had a rich artistic, literary, spiritual, architectural, and scientific traditions. Their culture was not inferior to that of Europe, except for technology, particularly military technology. As Prof. Jared Diamon points out in his brilliant ""Guns, Germs and Steel"", the reason the Mesomericans fell to the European invaders was not because their society was corrupt, as Gibson states, but because of specific geographic and ecological handicaps beyond their control.At the time of the Spanish conquest, Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, was one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the world including Europe, according to the conquistadors themselves as well as modern archaeologists.Even the ruined remains of the Mayan temples today are much more impressive and beautiful than the crude, small, primitive buildings of Gibson's misleading sets. When I first saw Tenochtitlan and the many other astounding architectural accomplishments of Mesoamerica, I realized I had been mislead in my education into considering Native American civilization as inferior. These buildings were as advanced and beautiful in their unique way as those of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. I felt then that the Europeans had razed them to the ground not to save the souls of the natives, but to eradicate a challenge to European supremacy. The present lack of appreciation of Mesoamerican culture as compared to ancient Greek or Egyptian culture is, I think, partly Eurocentrism and partly racist.At least Gibson's propaganda is free of biological racism. One other good point is that the dialog is in, I am told, passable Mayan, with subtitles. This encourages survival of the Mayan language. The world is facing a crisis of language extinction (another Jared Diamond theme). True, Gibson was arrested for drunk driving and ranted against the Jews as the cause of wars, which causes doubt that his bigotry is purely the result of religious dogma rather than displaced anger. But there is no hint in this film that the Mayans are inherently inferior or evil.Gibson has the same illness as the European invaders, who destroyed the beautiful cities and temples of the non-Christian natives out of bigotry and religious intolerance. Nothing could be allowed to challenge European-Christian supremacy four centuries ago.Gibson has destroyed Mexican culture for a second time in his film.Spoiler: At the end of the film, a European ship is shown landing with a Catholic priest, and the Mayans say they need a ""new beginning"". The film is saying, as it says in the opening credits, that pre-Columbian civilizations were corrupt and evil, and the European invasion, and conversion to Christianity, saved the natives from themselves.End of spoiler.The fact is that the European invasion killed an estimated 100 million natives. In comparison the Mayan and even the Aztec human sacrifices were negligible homicides. The Europeans destroyed the native cultures and religions beyond recovery. The Europeans enslaved the natives to work in their mines and plantations, and stole their lands and resources. To this day in many places the descendants of Europeans oppress the natives and control the lands.Gibson subscribes to schismatic, right-wing Traditional Roman Catholic views. Some such sects reject the present Roman Catholic church as heretical, and all reject Vatican II, the reform that brought the Church into the modern world by repudiating religious intolerance and antisemitism. He funded construction of the Tradionilist ""Holy Family Chapel"" Roman Catholic church in Agoura, California, which is schismatic from the Vatican. Gibson, in a few rare candid interviews, defends the brutal Inquisition. He is also associated with holocaust deniers, those who deny the reality of Hitler's genocide against Jews and Gypsies in spite of the overwhelming physical evidence and testimony. His documented beliefs are relevant to this review because this film amounts to the justification of another genocide, that of the Europeans against the American natives.Gibson is entitled to his religious beliefs and to make films that communicate his world-view. That is exactly why a strong negative review like this is necessary. Millions who see this film will not know it is a completely falsified version of history, and that they are being injected with bigotry and intolerance under the guise of entertainment.",Apocalypto

399,wda779,One of the biggest Oscar snubs of all time,10,6 August 2009,"I'm not here to debate whether Mel Gibson is a good person or not. I am here to discuss his work. As an artist and as a film maker Mr. Gibson has to be given the credit he deserves. Apocalypto is a poetic and unrelenting historical epic that deserved at least a Best Picture or Best Director nomination. How the academy could reward Scorsese for doing a mediocre film about a tired and overdone genre (The Departed) is beyond me. Apocalypto is the only film of its' kind ever made. The only thing the academy could hold against Apocalypto is that there are a lot of action and chase scenes. Yet, Gladiator won best picture six years earlier and contained much of the same. If the academy was punishing Mel for his ridiculous antics and anti-semitic tirades I can't blame them, but why punish all the actors, set designers, writers, costume designers and cinematographers who brought the Civilization of the Maya to life before our very eyes? This film, while touching many genres-historical, action, family drama, revenge fantasy, love story, political thriller and social commentary-is top notch on every level of production. Special mention should be made of the films' mind-blowing sets and costumes. The re- creation of the Mayan sacrificial temples and the scenes where we witness a massive public ritual are absolutely unforgettable. Relying on real sets and using minimal CGI, Apocolypto achieves its' mission-which is to fully immerse us in the pre-Columbian world of the Americas. The cast of Apocalypto-from top to bottom does outstanding work. Particularly Rudy Youngblood, the main character, and Raoul Trujillo, the absolutely terrifying Mayan war party Commander (and one of the great all-time screen villains). But it is important to realize that this is an ensemble piece, and the entire cast deserves immense credit.This is one of the best films ever made quite simply.

He has managed with Apocalytpo to again successfully introduce us to his vision of another time and place while projecting values that he holds as indispensable to humanity for all time --- namely courage, loyalty and self-reliance. The action takes place in MezoAmerica at about the time of the arrival of the Spaniards. The imminent decline of Mayan civilization is causing turmoil throughout the region. Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood)is witness to the destruction of his village (and his entire world) as he is thrown into slavery. The last half of the movie chronicles his attempt to get back to his pregnant wife and son. Be forewarned that there is considerable blood and lingering scenes of torture - these things have a place also in Gibson's vision -but who is to say that they are overdone? The actual reality was probably as bad or worse. Say what you want about Mel but he is bound to be heard -- one way or the other. Based on comments that he has made about the movie and also a quote from Will Durant shown at the beginning of the film.... regarding the collapse of civilizations coming from within.....It seems Gibson is intent is delivering a very effective, cautionary fable related to the current state of Western society.",Apocalypto
401,geebeegb1,Not what I expected.,5,9 December 2006,"I have been waiting for the release of this movie and was excited about seeing it. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.I was expecting to see a representation of the Mayan culture as a tribute to the advanced culture they must have been based on the ruins left behind. Instead they were shown to be a blood-thirsty, primitive society that were scared of a solar eclipse. This type of people could never have been organized enough to create the fantastic cities found in the Yucatan. The Mayans were quite advanced in astronomy and would have known the eclipse was coming. In addition, the time ""spent"" with the Mayans was minimal in the realm of things. Since the portrayal of them was incorrect, I am not too upset with the short time spent in the city but the trailers are misleading. This is not really about the end of a civilization - it merely takes place at that time.Now, if this ""movie about the Mayans"" intention is to include the tribal people as Mayans, I would then have to question whether the tribes in the forest were Mayans at all. My understanding is the Mayans were the city dwellers of that particular time in history. The people living in the forests were certainly native Mexicans but I question whether calling them Mayans is appropriate.So I am still wondering how the movie can really be called a movie about the Mayans when it contains so little about them.Also, Mel does seem to have the Mayans and Aztecs confused in some respects. Some of the scenes were taken right out of the book ""Aztec"". The sacrifices on the pyramid, the march of the captives to the city to be killed, etc. I agree with those who feel Mel Gibson is confusing the two cultures. Cortez and his group destroyed the Aztec civilization NOT the Mayan. The great Mayan cities were abandoned long before Cortez showed up although the descendants of the city dwellers were the first people Cortez encountered in Mexico. From a historical perspective, this movie just does not work.I came away from the movie trying to determine the point. I thought the movie was going to speculate on the unfortunate early demise of a glorious and advanced culture and honor that era. Instead I am left with a feeling of ""who cares"".I give the movie a 5 because there were some really good scenes and the acting was great given the script. The use of the Mayan language was impressive (assuming it was really the Mayan language - not sure we actually know that). I just think something was lost in the translation.",Apocalypto

I bought the DVD when it was on sale, and watched it. ""Apocalypto"" subtended my expectations, and even exceeded them.I have never actually liked prehistorical movies (if you don't count ""Jurassic Park"") but films which include human hunt for example is a different thing. The movie gives a whole new dimension to the line ""Payback's a Bitch, Ain't it?"" and I found myself repeating it in my mind many times during the second half of the film.People who don't like gore didn't seem to like this movie very much either, but hey, that's the way it was back in those days, get over it. Constant survival between the Mayan tribes was rolling every minute, and the weakest ones were sacrificed to the Gods. I have always been a fan of horror movies, so blood and gore didn't bother me at all.What did bother me was the birth scene near the end. It was baldly ridiculous, and looked like a scene from a terrible comedy movie. Other than that, I have no complains.The ending was also surprising and interesting, when the Spanish boats ran ashore.My opinion: Interesting movie with well done scenes that included entertaining action and still focusing on the subject, ""Apocalypto"". 8 out of 10 stars.",Apocalypto
405,Mandemus,Striking parallels to Planet of the Apes (1968),7,29 April 2008,"CAUTION!!! Spoilers. Please do not read until you have seen the film !While watching this film, I was struck by several similarities in plot and scenes that closely paralleled Planet of the Apes (1968). So much so, that I wonder how the similarities could not have been intended.The general scenarios bear some things in common:* Edenic tribe living a simple existence is hunted and captured by a more technologically advanced society located in a bizarre, otherworldly city * Captives are used for vivisection, torture, and target practice * One man escapes from the city and is pursued by soldiers * Film climax ends with an apocalyptic (or post-apocalyptic) revelationVisually, both films feature the city's army hunting captives through a corn field. Both films emphasize the captives' sense of bewilderment in the city, as well as their awe and disgust for what they see. Both films have the captives either as mute (POTA) or as virtually speechless once reaching the city (Apoc). The final sequence of both films features a man on his knees on a beach, awestruck by a hulking image of earth-shattering proportions. The image before the man represents the end of everything he has known in the past.For me, the similarities between Gibson's Apocalypto and Planet of the Apes are just too great not to have been, at least in part, a nod to the great ""fantaisie sociale"" by Pierre Boulle.",Apocalypto
406,juliano66,Solid film--Timely theme,8,27 December 2006,"I enjoyed Gibson's, ""Apocalypo"" on a purely visceral level, which is the way I prefer to experience movies on the big screen. The wonderful faces and natural acting talent of the cast we're worth the price of admission alone and the cinematography and scenery we're uniformly breathtaking. I think the historical and astrological inaccuracies to be forgivable as artistic license, though just barely. That being said, I had no real problems with this movie, I think there was an aspect of Meso-American civilization that was accurately depicted in this film--indeed the bad vibes still exist at many of the ancient sites alluded to in the film--human sacrifice was practiced in the extreme and the priest class of some of those pre-Columbian civilizations had descended into decadence much like in other ancient cultures, Rome, Egypt, etc. To this day, Cortez is both dually remembered as both a killer and a liberator. I think Gibson's film makes for both interesting and controversial viewing--something we need in this age of push-button murderers and evil, decadent rulers who wear thousand-dollar suits instead of feathers and demon masks, but practice the same deceptions and atrocities as of old -except on an exponentially larger playing field. This was the main message of this movie as far as I'm concerned. Good work, Mel.",Apocalypto

The first half of the movie is great character development about a man trying to save his family. The second half is all chase scenes.Pop some popcorn and open the bottle of scotch.

I mean, I understand that they don't agree with the Mayan depiction in the movie. But come-on! In movies, you don't have to be always correct in every aspect, especially when the ancient civilizations are involved. OK! It's true that there are many historical inaccuracies there, but there they are in almost all the Epic movies, each taking those to different levels to create and deliver the project.This movie is not even about Maya. The basic theme is 'Prey becomes the Hunter as a consequence of Cruelty'. And it is indeed taken with great care and is delivered in a marvelous way. I'm sure that even the people who gave the movie such low ratings also enjoyed the movie (many of them has accepted in their reviews as well). So why not admit it. It's indeed a great movie.Mel Gibson is indeed better then many great directors. Almost all of his movies have delivered the full entertainment in great ways. OK! Some of those might have infuriated some audience, but none of those movies committed any of the directional mistakes. I want to see more of his movies.9/10. Well!

411,twofold420,a bit too far-fetched,6,8 May 2007,"Although I enjoyed watching yet another historically inaccurate film from Mel Gibson (the first being 'Braveheart'), I found this one too far-fetched.not only does the hero escape a human sacrifice because of the unlikely event of a solar eclipse, but he also outruns a jaguar, survives jumping down a waterfall, making it out of quicksand, and somehow saving his wife, son, and newborn baby boy from drowning to death---in just two days. yeah right!! I criticized 'Forrest Gump' for the same reasons. At least this didn't win best picture though.Anyway, as I said, I did enjoy the film though, mostly due to the excellent cinematography (that should have been considered for an Oscar, but of course wasn't) and sound achievements. Hollywood hates Mel Gibson. Probably because he's the only person who has the balls to make a movie like this.

412,pylgrym,Providence Rules!,9,8 December 2006,"WOW. As a Bible-believing, born-again, fundamentalist, Vietnam and Desert Storm veteran who voted for John Kerry, I found this movie a royal freak-out! It's Mel's movie and he 'drama' well does what he pleases! I did not see ""The Passion"", as I am not of Mr. Gibson's persuasion that the person of God may be represented - but This.... Not coincidentally, but providentially (yes, I am a Calvinist too), I was studying the doctrine of Divine Providence during Thanksgiving week and it astounds me that Mr. Gibson has crafted a cinematic wonder right up there with Cornel Wilde's ""The Naked Prey"". Providence means that God not only made the world, but He controls every aspect of it - right down to the hairs on your head. God's attributes of holiness, wisdom and power are seen in His dealings with men and creatures. It is a great comfort to me to know that in every circumstance my Heavenly Father is working purposefully to accomplish His will. Throughout history (HIS story) it is clear that there is a tremendous plan at work. The screenplay of ""Apocalypto""with it's attendant imagery justifies the Almighty. It drives right along with inexorable fury, fierceness, humor, horror, tenderness, disgust, and sheer wonder. I loved the ultimate irony of the ending; as we fast-forward to today, we see quite clearly that Mr. Gibson's religion has done next to nothing to advance the poor folks south of the Rio Grande. Why do they all want to come here? Providentially, it's a religious thing! Good thing that God controls even the most minute details of His creation. The pit by the village, for example, is a cistern. The weather has been dry in our story. The rains prayed against by the protagonist, Jaguar Paw, came anyway but saved his wife and children. That Mr. Gibson used his art and craft and some very talented people to bring his vision to life on the Big Screen in such minute, incredible detail is commendable. It is all part of the Divine Plan: a movie about the past for today with eternal consquences.' I just thought of a story that has not yet been told on film - at least not fully treated with the care it deserves. Perhaps the subject matter again is too violent, too horrific, to un-PC to have been done before... Mr. Gibson, will you please consider doing your version of the Bible story of Elijah the prophet?

Everything about the movie brings some good to the table, and some bad. Bad elements do stick out the most in a way, and consistently at times throughout the film as well. For example, director Mel Gibson's overly brutal depiction of the Maya people is a little bit of a pro because it makes the characters gritty, which suits the overcast of intensity, but it's more of a con than a pro because it's to a point of such sadistic ridiculousness that we hear a native say ""what the f***"" in his language, which is at the peak of the level of how ultimately awkward and bothersome it is at too many times. In an overall sense however, this film is a raw and intense chase film that generates basic thrills, but is also a bit unique because of its relentlessly blood-thirsty rush of adrenaline, and is put together in an admittedly interesting, but nonetheless troublesome and questionable approach.",Apocalypto

Say what you want about Gibson but you cannot deny his attention to detail and ability to convey tension and atmosphere.one of the most respectable features of this picture is it's ability to tell a story through fantastic performances. It was brave for Gibson to cast almost entirely unknown actors, but thanks to rigorous casting, he managed to cast exceptional actors, who looked the part and could do the story justice. The dialogue is actually very minimal but it works.Each member of the cast is given specific hair and makeup, another impressive detail of this film. And there was clearly a decent amount of research that went into creating the films setting, dialogue, performance and overall narrative. Maybe it isn't entirely historically accurate, but the fascination that many of us have towards such ancient civilisations(such as the Maya civilisation) allows us to imagine what it would have been like.This is definitely one of the most gripping movies I have seen, I really cannot find much (if anything) to criticise it on. For those studying history, and in particular ancient civilisations, it may be possible to extract criticisms in the script and overall look of the movie. For the average viewer, it provides an entertaining and at times 'scary' experience.I could go on and on, but I will restrain myself from praising this movie anymore.. just please watch it.",Apocalypto

All of the Actors blew me away-- how in the heck did Mel find such a cast. Every actor put so much soul in the subtlest facial suggestion. They were so realistic, so like people we know that inevitably the viewers care very much for them. Long after the movie ended, I kept thinking of these people. The real people like them and what they went through in that lush and dangerous terrain-- their laughter, their warmth, and their culture long time ago.I was on edge the entire time watching this film. The movie is fast-paced -- I could feel my heart beat thumping along many times. This is one of the most beautiful stories ever to be made on screen.

416,belzebuebchen,South Park was right!,4,24 December 2006,"It's is hard to watch Mel Gibsons Apocalypto without thinking of the antisemitic comments he made last summer. And if this was a debut film it would be interesting and consequently realistic. But after seeing his portrayal of Jews in ""The Passion of Christ"" ""Gibbos"" work has to be handled more carefully.Here it feels like he wants to show us, that the Maya where a civilization to which the landing of Columbus was the best that could happen to them. They live in crappy huts and have bad teeth. And those are the ""good"" ones. The other Mayas just search the country for people as human sacrifices.The other thing I don't get is why Gibson shot his film on video? Is this Dogma now? Or has he had so many tickets from drunk driving that he couldn't afford celluloid? While the hand camera-style is functional in present time films to make them look ""closer"" (because we all have made videos like that in our life's) a film that takes place more that 500 years ago with a camera aesthetic that look like danish art doesn't really work.Mel Gibson used to be such a nice and maybe conservative actor, who starred in great films like the Mad Max - trilogy or the Lethal Weapon - series. I don't know what hit him that he's so much into these religious and cultural topics know.

That being said, I did see Apocalypto BECAUSE of those last two items, plus the story of the Mayans has always intrigued me and I wanted to see how Mel pulled this one off... For those of you who aren't used to reading subtitles and following a movie at the same time, this movie may initially seem like more of a chore then a pleasure. Since I ALWAYS have the subtitles on my TV, I'm used to it and wasn't hindered by that aspect at all; From the start, it is graphic, but also moves along nicely so if your eyes forget to read, you can definitely ""get"" what's going on; Basically, native people are brutally raped, killed, kidnapped; After the surprise, early morning attack on the remote village, the men and women that are still alive are forced to walk through the jungle and dangerous rivers ending up at their final destination: The Mayan Empire! The big Kahuna's are doing lots of be-headings and pulling hearts out of bodies in order to appease their gods; There's much going on: one of the warriors hid his pregnant wife and young son before he was taken...and he's on a mission to get back home; along the way, he's really p'd off one of the Mayan warriors and this lends itself to an interesting subplot (the are many of them!). Just as they're about to be sacrificed on top of a huge Pyramid with heads and hearts and bodies already rolling down hundreds of steps, there is a solar eclipse which stops the slaughter because apparently their god is now pleased; so what to do with the ""extra"" male slaves? It's decided by the warriors that they'll use them for ""target"" practice; some live, some die before the one that really counts (Jaguar Paw)is injured but manages to kill the son of the head warrior and all hell breaks loose (again!); I'm going to stop there because there were just so many things going on that I could probably do a 30 page dissertation. Just know this: The photography, acting, makeup, plot...all fits like a kid glove! OK, Mel, you're about to win countless awards from the Academy this year and they're richly deserved. You've redeemed yourself from your digression...at least for me; I'll probably see it again...this time with my son and a few of his buddies...They should see how real movies should be made!

Full marks to Mel for using 'dead' (actually near-dead) tongues in this and ""The Passion of the Christ"". This also was not original as the Latin film ""Sebastiane"" and Gaelic revival films out of Ireland and Scotland show.

There is no question that Apocalypto is lavishly produced with amazing make-up and costumes, and the acting is first-rate. But like several of Mel's other projects, the main point here is the violence and the gore. The story is so-so, and much of it is borrowed. Fully a third of Apocalypto is drawn straight from ""The Naked Prey"" starring Cornel Wilde from 1965. The rest is plain violence and hokey native wisdom, like, don't give in to fear.

I liked Caddyshack by the way.If you like The Fugitive meets Lord of the Flies meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but with a completely linear plot and no real dialogue, you might like Apocalypto. Likewise if you are entertained by the plot imagination of Power Ranger's episodes you might be entertained by Apocalypto.Ranks among the most over-rated movies of recent times, along with No Country for Old Men.If you are looking for a good under-rated film check out Jennifer 8; note the scenes with Andy Garcia and John Malcovich.

422,NoLittleLamb,An Artistic portrayal of those in the beginning.,6,24 May 2007,"So let's all just take a moment to forget that that strange, strange man Mel Gibson directed this movie and let's just look at it as a movie shall we...Ready? Okay.In a film where the actors are not particularly famous I feel there is even more of a chance for the audience to become connected to the film, where as when one is constantly referring to the main character as ""Keanu Reeves"" instead of Bill, or Neo, a certain believability is lost. That was on thing that benefited this film. With a very ethnic feel, the film was suspenseful and lively but it really didn't strike me as an awesome piece of cinema.I found the beginning rather slow paced, and the ending too fast in comparison. I found the ""jungle running"" very repetitive and thought that the bad guys would have probably given up a long time ago. Although perhaps I am underestimating the Mayans in their thirst for revenge. I found the violence a bit overdone, but nothing we haven't seen before or won't see again. While the beginning was slow, I don't think it took enough time for us to really care about the characters before we were already forced to fear for them.In the above statement, I am however only assuming they were Mayan because it was never specifically mentioned in the story line. The only reason we knew was because sometimes in the subtitles it would say ""Yelling in Mayan"" or something like that. If it would have been in English (as many films set in foreign places often are) there would have been nothing in the dialogue to let us know who these people really were, other than jungle natives. But perhaps they planned it that way.A lot of this film was rather unrealistic, I'm not sure that those are the kind of huts the Mayans really lived in, or that's really what they would have killed for food, but it's unrealistic ness was done in a very artistic way, which made it overallan okay movie. I did find myself really concerned about the family in the well and hoping they make it out okay, but the ultimate end of the movie was totally unexpected (and not in a good way) and seemed very deus ex machina, something totally unrelated that they just conjured up to end the movie.I do recommend you see this film if only to expand, in some ways, your cultural and cinematic horizons. Don't look at it for history project research of course, but watch it to get a better understanding of who was living here before us as well as to expand your list of ""not in English films"", they really can be quite good.",Apocalypto
423,ldoig,Very impressive,9,7 January 2007,"Like many, I find what I have been hearing about Mel Gibson's views rather depressing but I felt it wouldn't be right or fair to judge the film because of him as a person. It's interesting that of the 6 or 7 reviews of this film I had read prior to seeing the film were mostly incredibly negative and I'm now more inclined to think those reviews were biased by the critics personal feelings (of which I do in large agree with, but...)and not on the achievements of the film itself.I have to say I found the film a wonderful, enjoyable experience that I can't recommend enough to anyone who is vaguely interested in seeing it, either because of the controversy of Mr Gibson or because you are curious about past South American civilisations. While it probably takes artistic liberties with the real history it nonetheless gives an excellent flavour of the past (and pardon, but more ""primitive"" societies)and is bluntly honest in its depiction not just of violence but of how communities such as this must have cohabited. I'm also very impressed, along with many with the fact that it actually uses the ancient Mayan language. I think this is something many are growing to like about his films.I do agree with a few other comments on this site, I personally dislike the sadistic nature of many films these days, for example those such as the Saw trilogy, but in this case I can tolerate the gore and cruelty because it has a firm grounding in reality. To deny this sort of real violence would do the film and history an injustice. Because of this, I can't say the violence was gratuitous per se; though I did giggle at one point at the end as it was very ""Gibson'esque"" in the way the blood spurting out of a mans head was done - and I need to stress I am not a man who does gore particularly.Give it a whirl and see what you think, for the fact that I'm writing this comment, when I rarely bother is indication that at least something inspired me to write it in the first place.",Apocalypto

425,phj-2,Gibsons World,8,30 January 2007,"You usually have a notion of what you are going to see when you see a Gibson-movie. Whatever you should think of him, or his agenda, he is a master of effective film-making. I think the reason so many critics hate him is that he wants to show you ALL,he doesn't like hinting. He paints with a broad brush on a very wide canvas, leaving little to the imagination, and this is considered inelegant and even vulgar by the so-called intellectual critic corps. In Braveheart, he mastered this to the full. Passion of Christ was also sharing the same well-crafted efficiency, but for many reasons this movie did not appeal to me. In Apocalypto, we are taken to a lost realm. As peaceful villagers are attacked by marauding warriors, and are led to their doom in the capitol, we are served a classic drama/action epic. First of all, the imagery,photography and costumes are fantastic, and in this, plus the fact that all speak native Maya language, Gibson accomplishes to take us away to a different world, even a dreamworld. This is however a world filled with as much horror as splendor. As mentioned, Gibson doesn't like hinting. This results in buckets of blood,as our protagonists meet their fate in the most horrible ways. As our men are taken to the city to be sacrificed, to the roar of thousands of bloodthirsty onlookers, it resembles an 80s- exploitation movie, only with a much higher budget. This is in many ways the key scene of the movie. It's awe-inspiring and grotesque at the same time. This excess is the only objection I have to the movie. If Gibson could limit himself a little bit, it would be to the benefit of the movie, and to the claim of the Mayan ancestors for that matter. There are no proof that Mayans practiced human sacrifices anywhere near the industrial level Gibson shows us, and also in a filmic sense, it's a bit too much to take. However, Gibson loves BIG drama, and there are no limits to the lengths he'll go, and in this movie he has obviously sacrificed historical accuracy to make a full-blooded, effective action.-movie. The Mayans are BAD and the villagers(who also in fact are Maya) are GOOD. The Mayans are relentless,decadent and have seemingly no regard for human life or no fear of death or pain. Raoul Trujillo is great as the imposing Mayan war chief. Rudy Youngblood in the lead is also very good. The last hour of the movie is a breathtaking action spectacle, as the first chases the latter.If we choose to view Gibsons motive as to make a bloody, intense action-movie in a different setting, he has almost hit the jackpot. One can also argue, and seek deeper motives, and then it all becomes more problematic. If this is meant to be accurate, the depiction of the Maya can be interpreted as biased, or even racist. Is the there a profound morale that the arrival of the white man saved these ""savages"" from themselves? Maybe. However, I choose to place myself in the first category. I see this as Gibson himself proclaims; a brutal action movie in an exotic setting. And I am very entertained.",Apocalypto
426,laserdude,Directorial comments from a non-director. It's crap.,1,24 December 2006,"A couple of years back, I had the pleasure of seeing a movie called ""The Island"" being filmed in the metro Detroit area. If anyone has had that kind of experience, you know that it takes several hours just to set up a scene...then film it...check back on what was filmed and decide from there if you keep what you have filmed, film more if it doesn't meet your desired vision and then go on to the next scene you have planned to film.Seeing ""Apocalypto"" with this kind of knowledge makes this movie even more disturbing. For any one scene on the screen (1 to 5 minutes) involves hours of filming. My question to the director is why? How sick can one person be to immerse themselves into such levels of gore and say you are making a good film? I understand about freedom of speech, but there is also the responsibility as a story teller not to sicken your audience. It shows a lack of respect for your audience when you are unable to tell a story intelligently without the use of such self-destructive images as was used in this film.I understand why so many people have praised this film. Many of us are video game addicted. And Apocalypto has many qualities that are akin to the video game. It's fast moving. It's colorful. It uses images that stings the senses into believing we are watching something exciting. And it has the ""easy"" story line. That there is a good guy against a bad guy.But let us be honest. It is a sick movie. And it is curiously insulting to watch film about a people we, the general public, knows nothing about. Since when did Mel become the great provider of the truth? Yes,the movie is wonderfully filmed. But does that make it a good movie? A person taking a crap in the toilet, filmed in beautiful soundings with dynamic colors and a terrific sound track and with exciting music...is still that. A person taking a crap.My challenge to Mel and to any other director out there today is this. Instead of taking so much time and money to make toilet films, place your energy into something we can feel truly excited about. There are millions of wonderful stories out there about people who have done incredible things. Do we really need films about how ugly the human race can be? What about the potential of humans to create miracles, build a life of beauty, stand together in peace, and explore the vast unknown wonders of this universe? We don't need more war stories...cop stories...some teenager trying to get laid stories...nor another ""white guy"" making up non-sense about a people he knows nothing about.We are in the 21st century. Isn't it time for 21st century story telling. And not the same rehash of film done over and over and over again?",Apocalypto
427,Souvik,"Fantastically & Brilliantly made, but not one of Gibson's bests",8,11 June 2007,"This movie is a jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring tale of an Indian youth named 'Jaguar Paw' and portrays his life and battle to save himself and his family from the 'evil' Mayan warriors who invade his village and destroy it. The film depicts the events par-excellence and is brilliant in its story telling. However, do not expect Passion of Christ or Braveheart here. The story is much weaker than these two earlier Gibson ventures and does not really meet quite upto the same standards. Yougbloud is brilliant as the lead though everyone is overshadowed by Raoul Trujillo in his role as Zero Wolf, the main 'villain' in this movie. He was absolutely fantastic. A loving father at one end and a ruthless commander on the other. He was just brilliant. Definitely a must-watch.",Apocalypto
428,jeffcour,Stunning and spectacular!,10,25 May 2007,"This is an amazing work of art, a thrilling epic masterpiece that you cannot tear your eyes away from. It is so engrossing, so enveloping, you will feel as if you've stepped out of your normal life into the ancient Mayan world. Mind the R rating, these were brutal times, the film is NOT for young children, there are bloody moments.But appreciate the film for its depth. It lavishes great lengths of time on the tenderness and familial aspects of the Mexican Indian village culture, the joys and sorrows of their everyday lives, the thrill of their hunts, the cruelty of nature and finally the conquering Maya.Mel Gibson is a man of great talent, and with Apocalypto he has created an exciting, mind-boggling and realistic film with a fanatic attention to detail unmatched by anything you have ever seen. Everything you see was made by hand. NOTHING was CGI. ALL the sets, hand-made, life size. The Mayan temples, the villages, 700 extras, ALL real. An incredible amount of work went into this film, and it richly deserves to be seen and appreciated as the masterpiece it is. And don't miss the ""making of"" featurette ""Becoming Mayan."" Outstanding work of art!",Apocalypto

430,ccrivelli2005,Not Your Typical Mayan Family Drama,10,15 January 2007,"A family drama like no other. Two hours plus that rush at the speed of light. This is cinema. I'm sorry but it is. Don't look for inner meanings. This is the work of one of the greatest artists of our time. Yes, I'm talking about Mel Gibson. And as most of the great artists, he's bound to be controversial, erratic and infuriating sometimes but, thank God he exists. He's always going to surprise us for better or worse in sickness and in health. There are no intellectual under pinnings here. This is an adventure flick that takes us to places we've never been before. It entertains and moves and startles. Masterfully shot at a breathless pace that never, ever, lets go. And then, of course, the acting - if you can call it that. The most remarkable performances by an ensemble cast of unknowns. Gloroious faces that speak louder than words. Well, as you may have guessed. I'm overwhelmed by the experience. Thank you Mel, thank you very much.",Apocalypto
431,foxc-2,olde time Western in Central America,4,15 December 2006,"For costume and make-up design 10/10. For the movie as a whole...nice but not great.Plot is minimal and recognizable and predictable. The ""set"" pieces looked very staged and the characterizations, such as they could be, given the highly adorned physiques, rather 'stock' and one-dimensional. Nods to reality such as gapped, stained teeth, soiled garb and appropriate detailings of filth and grime, are spoiled by numerous gaffs: white, pearly teeth flashing winning smiles,and an overall laundered and fresh look to clothing worn continually in a terrestrial, semi-tropical environment. Add those jarring moments to plot twists that are contrived and obvious and you have a gorgeously photographed, visually stunning fantasy that tries to continue in the spirit of people who can envision these very foreign times and places.Unfortunately it's just not that good. I found it boring in parts...to the point of almost falling asleep. The chase sequences are often like the interminable rides of cowboy and calf, sheriff and outlaw, not to mention the bloody cattle drives that went on forever...no better for their foreign locale and time-warp but just the same. We know what's going to happen even if we don't know how.Unfortunately for ""Apocalypto"", Gibson never proves us wrong.",Apocalypto

433,Andy4444,Sucks to be blue!,8,10 December 2006,"Having seen previous Gibson creations, I was expecting a predictable and slightly cheesy revenge flick about a guy who goes on a killing spree to avenge or save his family, a la Patriot and Braveheart. Not that that's a bad thing, those were entertaining films, but this is a cut above. The expected over-dramatizing was missing, but there's good humor, the characters are believable, and even the bad guys have sympathetic personalities.The main character had only one other work to his credit, and most of the cast have no acting history, whatsoever, and perhaps that is the reason they seem so believable. The acting is good, the pacing is good, the sense of increasing dread as the characters approach the Mayan city, the music, and of course, the action. It's all done very well.Yes, it's gory, but after reading all the slam reviews I expected more gore than I saw. If you could sit through Braveheart this is a piece of cake.Gibson is, of course, a lately controversial figure, and that has unfortunately colored the view of his films, but whatever you may have heard, this film comes off as being, if anything, anti-religious. The superstitions of the ""civilized"" American Indians drives them to acts of stunning and sickening aggression towards their wood-dwelling cousins, and as the film draws near a close, you get the sense that the approaching Spanish missionaries won't be any more civilized. The main character is portrayed as a man of courage and common sense who tries to escape with his family from dangerously irrational nonsense of both American and European religion. For a staunchly Catholic man like Gibson to apparently have a mind open enough for this idea, my hat's off to him.BTW, don't let anyone smear blue finger paint on you. Ever.",Apocalypto
434,dada_neso,One more great artwork from Gibson!!!,10,25 December 2006,"Mel Gibson has done the impossible. He has created a tale of the Maya's people in different dimension. As an historical observation, the film is brilliant, depicting the violence in most of the movie. Finally, as a work of art, this film is unparalleled. This film will rock your world, and that's an understatement. One of the most beautiful films I have seen. This was a film I needed to see. It took me two viewings to really get a grip on it, so intense were the emotions it provoked in me. Even now, weeks later, re-examining it in detail is still deeply affecting. Its dialogue is entirely in Mayan language with English subtitles, a remarkably bold decision by Gibson, and one that pays dividends. On one level it unites an international cast, sparing us any clashing accents, and gives the film a greater sense of authenticity. On another, it forced Gibson and his team into a very visual form of storytelling; even amongst the carnage there are shots of aching beauty. Must see!",Apocalypto
435,nateroofams,Best movie of '07...if not all time.,10,29 January 2007,"The only reason this movie was not more popular is due to the fact Mel Gibson was involved. If his name wasn't controversial this would have exploded in the box office. From start to finish this brilliant masterpiece is full of pulsating action that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand. The brilliant directing and acting really gets the viewer involved. A few parts are graphic, but relevant to the story line. I applaud Mel for his contributions to this timeless piece of art. I pity those of you who did not see this movie in the theater for the sounds and pictures were so impressive. I can't wait to own this masterpiece for future viewings.",Apocalypto
436,caspare,"""My son... don't be afraid.""",10,28 December 2006,"This movie really is wonderful. Thanks, Mel. I have to say that I read critics before and they have been disgusting. As it seems, there is a specific group of people who are ideologically unfit to judge Mel's work with fairness I believe the movie has lots to say but the basic message for me was ""Don't be afraid."" This message should be targeted right at the heart of Americans who are, according to Michael Morre's ""Bowling for Columbine"", the Nation with the highest fear factor, leaving far behind every other civilized nation in the ""murders per inhabitant ratio"" and being ready to follow their ""leaders"" in whatever bloody war they ask them to fight. In beautiful pictures it shows that fear doesn't count. ""Fear is a sickness"", as Flint Sky rightly says. With fear, you either get slaughtered, or, you slaughter others. Without fear, you do what's necessary to protect yourself, your family and your hunting grounds. And that's it. Then you have always a new beginning. Fear never has done anything to improve a bad situation. Without fear, you are free. So I think Mel wants to say that American can only be truly free if they stop being so afraid. If fear is a sickness, longing for security is a sickness too, because it does not exist and will only poison your heart. That's what I thought when I watched this great movie.",Apocalypto

Get out the popcornIt's quite disturbing in some places too, and the gore only really adds to the feast. You really get to dislike some of the characters in it too, which I think is quite difficult in a film. And where did they get all those actors from. Are they real pierced parts they're wearing or what!?I can easily endorse this one and I'm a hard fan to please where films are concerned.

438,gaiadam933,A Tarzan's film spoken in Maya,3,8 September 2012,"This grotesque reconstruction by Mel Gibson of Maya civilization's decadence, exploits the modern technical devices of the cinema to tell a coarse story, terribly ingenuous,disquietingly perverse, and with a presumptuous attempt to be epic. The picture can only be arranged into the forgotten series of Tarzan's adventures,from which inherits the colonialist ideology of the author,the flat dimensions of the characters and the most conventional scenes of fight between the goods and the bads. It is added to this an unbearable exhibition of cruelty,killing and blood overflowing incessantly. The scenes of the pregnant woman and her little child in the pit and what is said at the end of the picture in front of the caravels are not the unique ones that could not be taken seriously. Also unbelievable up to the absurd is the long running of the wounded hero through the forest. We can accept incredible actions in some artistic genres, but here they wake up just laughter or indignation. Apocalypto is very expensive fiasco that could have been avoided.",Apocalypto
439,Polanski_Fan,"Not as good as ""Fast Runner""",7,8 December 2006,"There is only one other movie I've ever seen that could vaguely be in the same genre as Apocalypto. That would be ""Fast Runner,"" a low-tech revenge epic spoken entirely in Inuit, filmed in video, and released to critical acclaim and popular indifference several years ago.Apocalypto is incredibly violent, has dubious historical politics, and is over-long, but for a brutal, ""blunt force"" action movie, it is quite good. At times it feels like it should be a cartoon, or a graphic novel, or a sci-fi movie; you don't know much about the protagonist; the scene in the Mayan capital is too short and not expansive enough; there are some laugh-out-loud dumb parts--still, it is effective and probably would have been more effective WITHOUT subtitles. That's right. None of the dialog in this film is important. You could (more or less) correctly guess at all the crucial bits.I was entertained. Definitely not a classic like ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" or as good at capturing the epic feel as ""Fast Runner,"" but hey...for 99% of viewers, this will be a film experience like no other.",Apocalypto

Everything from amazing camera work, breathtaking visuals and superb wardrobe (kidding! ;) unless you consider ancient g string type things a work of art of course...there were chances for wardrobe in the 'city' to excel themselves which they did but I am not qualified to comment on authenticity, or of course on the authenticity of the scars, tribal markings etc etc but everything looked brilliant and so true to life.

442,batocicero,"A visual feast, and a film with more layers than previously thought.",10,7 December 2009,"What most people probably say first about Apocalypto (if it's not about the bloodshed) is just how gorgeous the photography is. I've seen few films that numbed me with such a breathtaking location as this one has. Heck, I wish I could go visit the place at least once, and sit down next to that beautiful waterfall and maybe even meditate right in the spot, or have a picnic (of course, being respectful to nature and leaving no litter ;)).However, I believe there is more to Apocalypto than natural beauties and dead bodies everywhere. It is about a civilization, for one. I know many feel the film depicts the Mayans as savage and cruel, that the Mayan city is anachronistic and that Gibson should have included more about the Mayan's scientific achievements. But this is not meant to be a documentary. I have never seen a Mesoamerican city or people as convincing as in this film before. I totally bought it. It just blew my mind.Aside of that, I believe there is a hidden message for anyone. Some can interpret it as being about overcoming seemingly impossible challenges, some others about change and chaos, some about rebirth. I just like to see it as a depiction of what life may bring us, of just how unpredictable everything is and how virtually nothing is meant to last forever. That's the message Apocalypto has for me, because I like change, because I like revolution and progress (I'm not even talking about the Spaniards, but more about Jaguar Paw's destiny; he had to adapt to the circumstances).I believe this movie deserves more praise than it has received. I also fail to see why some people are ""offended"" by it. Hell, I'm Mexican myself, and I'm not offended in the least. At least, someone took the Mayans to the big screen and created this masterpiece. It was about time someone would use such a great culture for a film. I'm so tired of films about Ancient Egypt, it's way overused. The Mayans were a culture as impressive and advanced as the Egyptians, why shouldn't they feature in a film as well? 10/10.",Apocalypto

You slide up to become better acquainted, and the first impression is wonderful. Making an evening of this, you find that the beauty is as superficial as anyone else in the room, and not the dream you wished for.That gleaming sight married with the average is this movie. It really has the looks. The special effects are convincing enough. The scenery might just be enough of a reason to watch this film. However, the biggest miss was the story following along the formulaic path that Hollywood has already set in stone.The character building in the beginning backfired on me. The main character didn't come of as a friendly prankster, but rather like a school yard bully. After we find out the purpose of his 'quest', we see his actions become defensive as he runs from his newly found troubles. These troubles wind up being the whole purpose of the story.As others have commented, the beginning bests the end. That leaves many feeling good overall rather than great. I did enjoyed the film for what it was. I admit, the criticism I offer doesn't balance enough positive against the negative. Let me point plainly in saying: It's a good action fantasy film which pits the bad guys versus the good guys (yet again) -- but in a visually appealing way.Of the hundreds of films I own, this one will never make it to my collection.

One after the other his knocks are perfect .. be it Brave Heart, Passion Of The Christ and now the Apocalypto, every delivery is spot-on .. of course with a lot of gore .. Now coming to this movie ..I wouldn't say that its the years best (No way close to 'The Departed'or 'Babel'), but definitely worth a watch. It has a very simple plot ..a native forest hunter captured by a group of members, the so-called messengers of a new upcoming civilization ..escapes from their claws and comes back to save his pregnant wife and son .. Having a simple plot, the only way for the director to impress the audience is with the story narration and yes Mel has done it in style. The starting an hour or so, upto the eclipse is terrific and the movie fades away a bit in the second half; but the wonderfully picturised, all-gore chasing sequences make the second half worth watching .. Maybe this is not the best kind of movie you could go out with your family in this festive season, because of the violence it unleashes .. but of course we need these kind of movies at least once in a while :) Thanks to Mel ! Also this could have been a bit more appealing if the director had concentrated on the essence of the second half rather than totally depending on the CG invaded current version ..

449,sonofgodtrujesus,Bad Things Happens To All People,10,2 January 2007,"Mel Gibson is a paranoid, delusional, anti-Semite; so are we to judge him as such, and not go see his movie because the proceeds from his film could possibly go to fund white supremacy groups and organizations all over the world, possibly giving Mel the opportunity of living out his fantasy as the next totalitarian racist dictator, forcing us all to watch his movies? These are the questions that I had to seriously contemplate before dropping my hard earned cash down on this film. But then it hit me that I had already seen Braveheart 20 times, and own it on DVD. And I've seen the Passion of The Christ 1000 times and own it on DVD, thus the damage had already been done. I'd already been an ignorant accomplice, funding my own systematic eradication from existence, giving loads of cash to his very entertaining pied piper. Looking at the Passion of the Christ though, I'd have to say that Mel was pretty accurate in his depiction of the last days of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. In fact, in the end of Mel's film Jesus rose from the dead, giving all true Christians a sigh of relief. This is the chief reason why I went to see Apacalypto. If Mel Gibson believes that Jesus Christ rose from the dead then their is no way that he can be anti- Semitic; right? After hearing all the things in the media about Mel's drunken tumultuous tirade, I went into this film with my racist cap on, looking and searching for anything remotely discriminating; and I can honestly say that I found nothing offensive. In fact I found a picture that made me feel like a kid dropped off at the movies, on the weekend, with my best friends, viewing a kick ass film, that we would spend the rest of the week talking about. The film used in Apacalypto kind of reminded me of Michael Mann's Miami Vice or Collateral, a sort of filtered video film; which I must say, I love to watch. The acting is flawless and their are times that you feel as though you're watching the discovery channel rediscover some lost Mayan tribe.

I felt like I was 10 years old again watching a cheesy Tarzan movie at the Saturday afternoon matinée, but this adventure film was far better. Great production values, first rate scenery, and elegant direction made this B thriller a bit more than it could have been. Forget about learning anything about Pre-Columbian history. This movie is just not very accurate even though it tries just hard enough that it acquires a veneer of respectability. If you want history, watch the History Channel. If you want a fun run through the jungle, with good guys and bad guys, lots of action, and pretty scenery this movie is for you. The blood and gore is there, but the reviews seem to overstate it.

454,booyatom,We forgive you Gibson!,8,8 December 2006,"Apocalypto doesn't explain why the great Mayan civilization self-destructed. There are already too many theories out there attempting to make sense of its downfall. So, instead, director Mel Gibson offers us a thriller, the kind that has rarely been seen before.I did not see The Passion of the Christ, but I heard that it was rather controversial. Here, with Apocalypto, Gibson in no way tries to convince us of his own views as to the downfall of the Mayans. To be sure, it is happening during the events in the film, but the story has little to do with the politics and the economics of the kingdom. All that is nothing but the background of the story.Jaguar Paw (that's right, his name's Jaguar Paw) lives in a tribe deep in the Mexican forests with his father, friends, wife and son. His wife is expecting. He hunts by day and comes to his family in time for supper and nighttime activities like dancing and story-telling. Hence, very early, Gibson shows us that these people are jokers, some are comical, they are wise and loyal; they are not savages.One day, Jaguar Paw's tribe is attacked and the men and women are captured, leaving their children to fend for themselves. There is quite a heart-wrenching scene when the adults are slowly being dragged away from the village as the children watch, crying. They are then taken to their captors' headquarters, the enormous Maya City, which surrounds a towering temple. Atop this structure, human sacrifices are made to please the Gods.JP manages to escape this undesirable death due to his physical strength and will to find his family where he hid them back home.And so ensues a great thrill ride through the Mexican jungle. Quick sand, enormous hornets an angry jaguar and the likes are all in the mix as JP races to his trapped family.Gibson wrote the script of Apocalypto. I can say with confidence that he did quite a good job. Nothing is overlooked. At the beginning, we see that JP's wife is going to give birth. Later, this comes back as a device which Gibson uses to fuel his thriller. Also, JP has a recurring opponent in the blood-thirsty Hanging Moss (that's right, you heard me, the guy's name is Hanging Moss!). This is never forgotten and their rivalry (and hatred) only grow as it progresses to an inevitable end.Also, the decline of the Maya is always a surrounding element. Crops are dry and food is becoming scarce in the Kingdom. Their conclusion is that the Gods are angry. It is for this reason that human sacrifices are increased. This is also be the reason for JP's village being ransacked.The photography is beautiful and at times breathtaking. It is also sometimes cringe-inducing during the violent scenes. But, to reassure the squeamish, the violent parts are rarely without meaning. In other words, when someone dies, we have already been introduced to the character, and so, it either comes as a shock, if the character is a good guy, or as a delight if the character is an bad guy, when he/she dies and therefore the gore is more acceptable. For example, when JP kills his enemies, instead of cringing, we see it as one less enemy chasing him. Nevertheless, some of the violence is gratuitous and unnecessary, like for example, during the human sacrifices, Mel makes the scene go on for a little too long. Apocalypto remains, until I see Passion, one of the most violent movies I've ever seen.Mel Gibson gives us a great triller under never-before-seen circumstances. It is captivating and exciting, and personally, I learned a lot watching it.",Apocalypto
455,carlostallman,The Artist As A Tough/Rough Man,10,16 January 2007,"One of the roughest, toughest art films I've ever seen. Remarkable, sensational. Non a mean task to put aside all the gossip surrounding the man behind this miracle and look at ""Apocalypto"" for what it is : a startling piece of art done by one of the most startling artists of our time. But I was able to do exactly that and sit there open mouthed, totally transported to the world Mel Gibson had in store for me. I don't want to get into any spoilers but let me tell you there are, at least, 4 moments - not merely technical but emotional - that are a first for the movies. There is violence in the film yes, but not nearly as much as in ""Casino Royale"" and definitely more justified. I'll take my wife next time, she stayed home, brainwashed by the avalanche of misinformation claiming it was one of the most violent films ever made. I know my wife well enough to know she will love ""Apocalypto""",Apocalypto
456,peterwink,"Fast and furious from start to finish, an excellent watch",9,18 August 2007,"I watched this film a couple of nights ago with fairly low expectations, well how wrong can you be. This film had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The characters are well defined, and the mysticism that was present throughout added to rather than dominated the film. To anyone out there who is in 2 minds whether this production is worth 2 hours of your time, stop dithering sit down and prepare yourself for the ride!!! The beauty but underlying menace of the rain forest was graphic as was the relationship between man and nature. The plot although superficially simple explored many facets of the nature of man from the best, caring and looking after others to absolute cruelty, it also contained a personal tale of actualisation. In all Mel a very good effort, nay excellent A++, this is one I will watch and watch!",Apocalypto
457,rockchester,Historical perspective,9,20 October 2011,"Regardless how flawed the world may see Mel Gibson as, he's a first rate filmmaker. If you haven't seen this movie yet, make sure you are prepared to sit at watch it for a couple of hours because it is so riveting that you don't want to get up even with a pause button.Like Barbara Tuckman's book ""A Distant Mirror"", Apocalypto reflects the parallels between modern civilization and one in decline in the distant past. Where as Tuckman shows us the similarities between our modern era and 12th century Europe, Gibson gives us a stunning view of a superpower slowly destroying itself from within while neatly allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks, as it were, and see our own reflection.Apocalypto is considered rather violent by our present-day pacified society but it's not gratuitous violence; rather, it depicts a society and a time at least a thousand years ago that had no delusions or affectations of being non-savage as ours does today. You may not want the kids to see this one. At least, not with you and not for a few years.That said, the hero is a member of a tribe that is far enough from the Mayan civilization not to be influenced by them but close enough for its warriors to come along and capture them and either sell them or use them as human sacrifices in their rituals.Historically, we don't really know why the Mayan civilization collapsed. As the film's opening William Durant quote ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" suggests, it may simply have exploited its natural resources to exhaustion and destroyed itself or endured an extended period of drought. Again, we don't really know. Even those modern-day ancestors of the Mayans have no way of knowing for sure.It is also largely regarded as fact that the Mayans practiced human sacrifice as part of their worship of the heavens. It was a very advanced society for its time; it had a written language, studied mathematics and astronomy, for example, and despite how barbaric we see them as today, they had a lot going for them as far as civilizations go.The film starts as the Mayans are somewhere in decline (presumably sometime during the 8th or 9th century) and just before the Spanish Conquistadors arrived at southern Mexico. That, of course, is theatrical license, it's not established fact that Spain's forces arrived at that moment in time but it gives Jaguar Paw a way to finally escape capture by the remains of the warrior band who pursued him.",Apocalypto
458,wanbliwinyan,Forget the negative Mel Gibson Media and. . .,10,10 December 2006,"Forget the negative media garbage about if people will see this movie. Think for yourself, go see it. If you like Mel Gibson movies, you will throughly enjoy this one. He is still at the top of his game. His sensitive treatment of Native Peoples was ever evident. As a Native American, I felt he treated the People with total respect and honor and most of all truth. I love the unknown actors, you weren't clouded by whether or not, you thought, ""big star name,"" was doing a good job in the movie. I loved the subtitles, it gave a even more realistic touch to the movie to hear the characters speak in their native language. The cinematography was outstanding. I wanted to walk into the screen and be there. At times I felt like I was there. When Jaguar Paw was running from the Mayan soldiers, I literally had to tell myself to ""breathe."" Extremely intense scenes. I'd give this movie a hundred stars if that was a option. Sincerely, Linda Hayes Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek Nations",Apocalypto

The Maya survive to this day and were still making sacrifices upon arrival of the Spanish, but the few pyramid sites that were inhabited were occupied by people living in ruins of a civilization hundreds of years dead. What bothered me though was the timely arrival of the Spaniards. Couldn't a meteor strike have more credibly conked out the last two pursuers? OK, I know, it is just a movie. I wish IMDb had more information about locations, they never get enough credit. I understand this film was shot near Catemaco, Veracruz and believe the waterfall is near San Andres Tuxla.

The actors portray a stunning, yet disturbing account of life in Maya. There are no excuses for the portrayal of the gruesome methods used in those days and Mel is honest in his demonstration. Because of this your eyes won't deviate from the screen.It begins with a life in the wild, bloody scene that immediately introduces the viewer to the intense and graphic content contained in the film. Giving the viewer a chance to leave, if they're squeamish.The one grip I have with this film is, I can't help but wonder why these people were shown in a biased sense. Referring to there famous sacrificial and bloody thirsty side. The Mayan's were a beautiful and highly intelligent (advanced even) people.I say if your intending to watch this movie, don't watch it through the eyes of western society.

463,john.schneider,Nothing But Ugliness and Bloodletting,2,9 December 2006,"I wish the reviews had indicated what one might expect from this film. I won't give away any spoilers as there is little in this film to spoil. It is virtually just a bloodbath from beginning to end with very little of a substantive plot to separate each killing.Sure there is a plot, but the gore, violence, brutality, evil, wholesale slaughter, and torture pretty much cancels it out.I expected so much more from Mel Gibson, as I've enjoyed and appreciated his other films. Even The Passion of the Christ, which I think it fair to say overstated the brutality of the scourging of Jesus that final night, has so much more than just depicting the bloodletting. But at least the whole point of the Passion was that He shed his blood for us. But Apocalypto is NOTHING but gore, showing mankind being cruel out of enjoyment.The cinematography is lush and gorgeous being filmed on location. But when the focus of that cinematography killing and torture, it becomes repulsive and ugly.One last thing concerning an astronomical event depicted, I really wouldn't consider it a spoiler. . . . but a total solar eclipse is followed by mere hours by a full moon! Any grade school child could tell you this is not only impossible, but it is stupid to even suggest it, much less put it in a Hollywood movie! This film is a major disappointment. Be warned before you buy a ticket.",Apocalypto
464,graffixalley,Stunning movie experience,9,11 December 2006,"I went to see this movie because I studied the Mayan culture quite a bit in college and was curious to see what would make it to the screen. For the most part, I was not disappointed. The camera work was absolutely breathtaking and the dialog was minimal, so I didn't have to read subtitles constantly while the action was going on around me. The jungle and city scenes reminded me of the actual places I visited in the Yucatan peninsula and further south. What was really amazing was the actors use of the Mayan language. While I am no expert, the rhythm of the speech sounded pretty close to what I remember from my travels. Kudos to both the actors and the dialog coaches! The only big problem was the historical accuracy. From the theories that I learned (20 years ago, BTW), the Mayan city scenes were most likely separated by several hundred years from the 'ending' of the movie. Still, I gave this a high rating because it just works as a very exciting movie. I would recommend this to anyone who can watch a movie with subtitles.",Apocalypto
465,dibyajyotisarma,Magnificently savage,7,9 March 2007,"What's wrong with Mel Gibson's tale of apocalypse of the Maya civilisation? As the film ends you're thoroughly dissatisfied. Yet, it's difficult to pinpoint what went wrong. A tale of degradation of a society on the verge of self-destruction, the film has an epic sweep which Gibson handles with all his mastery. If nothing else, you have to admire the director's eye for details. Even a fleeing one second shot is filled with telling details. Add to that breathtaking photography, and make-up and costume that brings to life an era already forgotten, and Yucatan language to add to the authenticity, and you expect a winner. And the winner the film is, except that Gibson chose to tell a story as short as the loincloth his actors wore. It begins with a philosophical quote and ends up being a 'primitive thriller,' a Fast and Furious on foot. This is where the problem lies. The decline and fall of Maya Civilisation you expect to see is nowhere. The story is this. The empire is affected by the famine. The land needs blood. So the warriors of the city raid villages in the jungle and take the men as sacrifice. Among them is our hero Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), who in the meantime hide his pregnant wife and young son in a well. Now he must outwit his captors and escape and, he does. That's the story. Where Gibson has nothing must to tell, he fills the scene with details, and raw graphic violence. If the city scenes, with the human head falling down the stairs, give you a sense of claustrophobia, or the chase scenes make you sit on the edge of your sit, consider the film as successful. Finally, what the film wants to convey? Read it as an allegory of our time if you will. But it is worth a watch, for the sheer recreation of the age which even history is not very sure about (never mind to the fact that critics are crying hoarse that the film is ahistorical.) One word of caution: this film is not for faint-hearts and certainly, certainly not for children.",Apocalypto

These are the things that will run through your mind as you become engulfed by this film. You will be there. The ugly will make you sick, ready to vomit, (for me, to the point I had to turn away). I wished it to stop, and I have a strong stomach for films. The evil will make you hate the ones causing it, or perhaps you yourself are evil ... then you will take their side and enjoy. The good will make you breathe harder, it will make you stronger. You will cringe as they cringe. You will run as they run. You will become this movie and it will not leave you so easily. This movie makes me think about the end. It makes me realize how good we have it here in this nation. It reinforces how people are so arrogant ... they have no idea how bad it can get. It can happen again. I believe that. The next time you see someone in need of a hand, hold yours out to help. We will all die one day. Maybe all that matters is what you do while your here.

468,turbo_torben,Escape from Eldorado,9,4 December 2006,"One can easily smell trouble when Mel Gibson is releasing a new epic movie based on historical events. Braveheart formed quite a buzz, regarding the violent battles and the somewhat arrogant description of the English king (and his homosexual son). Passion of the Christ proved to be a little too explicit when describing the suffering of Christ.With Apocalypto more trouble is sure to arrive at the doorstep of Gibson's home. Of course there is the obvious political metaphor, comparing the Maya civilization with the United States. The Maya empire was destroyed from within, and according to the metaphor USA will do the same.The fear theme is primary: The priests are controlling their people with fear, and by doing so they can get away with barbaric actions. - USA's international politics are sure to be mentioned, when the debate will start to roll.But then again, it's also a movie, and should be reviewed as one. It is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. One should be warned though; considering Braveheart and Passion of the Christ, one can expect a very violent a ruthless movie. And it is! I wouldn't be surprised if some people will leave the cinema during this movie.It's a very tight and linear story, but that gives the plot a lot of strength. The atmosphere is remarkable. The spoken language is no problem what so ever, and after just a few minutes people will not be viewing a movie... They will be in it, holding their breath. It can be regarded as a 'clever' movie, or it can be regarded as an action packed roller-coaster, through the dark jungle.

It fits the story and is well within what is known from historical sources.Mel Gibson is a master at defining characters. You like his good guys and have no trouble cheering for them. They are sympathetic, believable and very human. His bad guys are brave, good warriors, loyal to their cause and believable in their roles. They are seeking ever more slaves and victims for sacrifice to their pagan Gods. They are easy to dislike, but still respectable as humans. The use of sub titles is excellent. By having the characters speak in their native tongue, it helps maintain the ""feel"" of the movie. You get so used to the subtitles, they do not interfere. The ending is a thoroughly fun twist.Seeing the movie and the Mayan way of life provides a visual perspective of how it was possible for Hernanado Cortez and his 500 Spaniards to conquer the Aztec Empire. It was actually Cortez, 500 Spaniards and his very loyal 200,000 Tlaxcalan warrior allies. The Aztec's religion was based on slavery and taking hostages from the lesser tribes to use for human sacrifice in their pagan religion. The Tlaxcalans and some others tribes decided it did not matter how bad Cortez was, he still had to be better than the Aztec. They blindly supported him and allowed for his victory. After seeing the bad guys in Apacalypto, the Tlaxcalan's choice of Cortez makes sense.Fun and entertaining while being a reasonably accurate historical lesson.",Apocalypto

474,mushbuster,Jaguar Paw's Great Adventure,10,11 December 2006,"The reviewers are trying to damn this movie with an untruthful and insincere mantra about its alleged excess of violence: ""brutally violent,"" ""over-the-top violence,"" ""unrelenting violence,"" ""ultraviolent,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes in the jungle,"" ""unpleasant, pointless, gruesome, and exploitative,"" ""pure, amoral sensationalism,"" ""blood and gore  so extreme that they provoke titters of ridicule,"" ""savage cruelty and sadistic barbarity,"" ""lunatic violence,"" ""feverish, mad violence."" You'd think from the reviews that you were going to see two hours of babies being fed through a wood chipper. One went as far as to claim that it made the Saw movies seem like Little Women or some such nonsense.It does no such thing. The Saw films were gratuitously and sadisticly violent; they set out to make audiences squirm and blanch at their sick, nihilistic machinations.Apocalypto, on the other hand, is the typical, essentially optimistic Disney story of a happy Indian youth ripped savagely from his rainforest life by ruthless marauders, after which he has to escape and fight his way back to his land and people. That's it.The violence arises from the fact that these particular marauders are bloodthirsty Mayan warriors harvesting neighboring tribes for their human sacrifices. Even then, much of the violence is Shakespearean and takes place just off-camera. For instance, you see women being carried off in the rape-and-pillage scene and you hear their cries but you don't see them being raped and murdered. Battles are staged much as they were in Braveheart. And yes, there's a beating heart lifted from a sacrificed man's chest by a blood-streaked Mayan shaman, but moviegoers saw the same thing in Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; it got a PG rating and we read no critical hysterics about ""lunatic violence."" On the whole, you'll see as much blood and gore on the average CSI episode.It probably should have been titled Jaguar Paw's Great Adventure. The glimpses Gibson provides of Mayan civilization are jaw-dropping. You won't ever see a more convincing cinematic evocation of another time and place in such scope and meticulous detail. Every face seems to have a complete history as Jaguar Paw is marched through the Mayan city. A well-to-do Mayan woman does nothing more than look at the prisoners from her doorway but the story her face tells is voluminous.The last part of the movie is a rousing chase akin to The Naked Prey, and again, no more bloody and violent then the film it resembles. Let's be plain here. What really has the critics'--especially those of the Eastern Elite variety--panties in a twist is the director, Mel Gibson. He said some things that upset them, plus (and most unforgivably) he's an outspoken and conservative Christian, so they're going to practice any sort of mendacity that will keep people from buying tickets to his film.

Very violent, but as always the violence has a wider purpose. Gibson has a vision that is sadly missing today by other directors! In Norway they had to increase the age limit for Apocalypto from 15 to 18 after pressure from tabloid newspapers looking for sensation headlines! The decision was based on lies that a lot of 12 year old were watching the movie together with their parents!

I don't remember a dull moment in the movie. And YES it is gory and violent. But in the end it's Gibson's style of portraying reality. His allegory has been successful in many ways. Firstly the sets are outstanding, the line, although few, are hard hitting, the performances are out of this world and the action is fantastic. It did receive negative reviews from many viewers who did not quite understand it, especially the one's who found 'baby' movies like Troy violent. The first half of the movie is really nice, you are submissive to the charms of the Mayans and their way of life. I felt part of the Mesoamerican world and you sympathize with every person killed. The second half just takes you to newer heights and makes you grab your seat tight. I can go on n on n on about this movie. But i'd just like to say that this is a brilliant movie and a fresh format of film-making. It's inventive camera-work and experimental screenplay just makes you long for more.

478,bowtiecinema,Extreme Pointless Violence proves that Mel Gibson has lost it!,2,8 December 2006,"Being not only a fan of Mel Gibson's directing, but also of his tremendous talent for acting, I feel completely validated in saying that with his most recent film, Apocalypto, he's let me down. In my opinion, Gibson has lost it. Both Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ were films of historical significance about events that were historically significant, but they never felt inappropriate or too much. Apocalypto is too much! Although it's about a historically significant time period and is probably a very accurate portrayal of the Mayan culture, the level of violence in this film is shocking. It's similar to the brutality of The Passion of the Christ, but without reason and any redeemable factors. The entire film made me cringe and wonder ""does an audience really need to see this?"" The intensity of this film is great and it's paced perfectly without any lulls, but when I go to see a movie I'd prefer not to be forced to look away from the screen to save my stomach. I find it interesting that a film this violent, done in the context of history, is acceptable, when really it is just like Hostel. Violence can be portrayed very shockingly without seeming like too much. Take for instance Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. In the shower scene the audience gets an impression of the violence without seeing a single knife blade entering the body of Marion Crane (that scene also give the impression of nudity without it really being there). In Apocalypto on the other hand, we see heads rolling down steps, decapitated bodies falling, hearts being cut out, Mayans being skewered in every way imaginable, throats being slit, head wounds squirting blood, etc. There isn't a single act of violence in this film that is tastefully shown and it's only considered a respectable film because it's by a seasoned director in the context of historical accuracy. At least you have to hand it too the special effects department. I really thought people were being tortured.",Apocalypto
479,Mi5-5,One of the Best Movies of the Year,9,16 December 2006,"This was a creative, original, entertaining motion picture that I initially didn't think I'd enjoy. Two and a half hours of reading subtitles is about my limit and I'd really like to see Mel Gibson do a movie in English for a change. Basically, if you had ""The Naked Prey"", ""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Rambo"", and ""Predator"" together in a tumbler and had the concoction ""shaken, not stirred"", then added a twist of Lamaze-style childbirth and a splash of human sacrifice, you would get ""Apocalypto"". The story is fresh, well-told, the acting incredibly good and the cinematography superb. My only concern is that this movie is certainly not for everyone, mainly because of the blood and gore and it's not very uplifting. There are more hearts torn from chests than in ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and more beheadings than in Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"". The good guys are easy to tell from the nasties, as they all have great teeth, while the bad guys all seem to be wearing bad braces.One of the best movies of the year!",Apocalypto
480,david-dtn,A Mayan Adventure with a message,9,6 February 2007,First of all id like to say I really liked this film. There may have been some contrived plot developments in order to keep the story moving but I think as a whole it turned out to be a very entertaining action adventure and an effective political/environmental allegory on civilisation and the consequences of power and excess.It was shot almost entirely on digital camera which is a bold step for a film of this nature. It gives it a unique feel and the cinematography and costumes are some of the best I've seen. Mel Gibson really did his homework here with even the language used by the natives delivered in an authentic ancient South American dialect.Much as been said about the historical inaccuracy of the natives and the time period in which the film was set and unfairly so in my opinion. It is not a documentary and its main emphasis is to entertain so obviously there needs to be some suspension of disbelief in order for it to work like most films in this genre. Some fine performances by all the cast with Rudy Youngblood giving an excellent performance as the main character (Jaguar Paw). Special mention to the invading Mayan tribe leader (Zero Wolf) who really makes his character believable as a nasty villain whose not to be messed with!,Apocalypto

Second, it has, bar none, the most exciting and exhilarating foot chase I've ever seen. Third, the characters are very memorable, their different personalities and motivations beautifully conveyed in the Mayan language.However the standout feature of the movie is it's ability to transport the viewer to an authentically-feeling representation of an exotic and grand ancient empire.

482,europolismovie,"""Never get on to the boat...""",9,7 June 2007,"Mel Gibson's public persona evokes nothing more or less than a portrait of buffoonery of late, what with his drink/driving/anti-Semitism/cop berating; not to mention his English bashing 'The Patriot' and 'Braveheart', (The battle of Stirling Bridge without a bridge! Oops.) But his biblical oeuvre 'Passion of the Christ' and now 'Apocalypto' implies a directing capability bordering on brilliance.Mayan civilisation on the eve of 'Hurricane Conquistador' is a society in decline after a thousand years of being one of the most advanced in the world. A Young tribesman, Jaguar Paw is captured, along with what remains of his village, after a vicious attack by an army of warriors from the big city and taken on a perilous journey for a date with unspeakable evil. What follows is a breathtaking action thriller that transports you into 15th century Mexico and a world of untold savagery.An air of mysticism permeates this tale but it never quite spills over into the realms of the supernatural making a couple of seemingly exasperating divine interventions borderline believable. All the dialogue is authentic Yacatec Mayan and the cast are predominantly indigenous to the Mesoamerica's giving the sensation of an authentic glimpse into the past.Apocalypto is the story of a culture in conflict with itself and thus rendered fair game for the destructive machinations of more powerful outsiders implying that progress and sophistication brings an inherent soullessness, corruption and ultimately self-annihilation. Sound familiar?",Apocalypto
483,mmckaibab,Blood Porn or . . . Mel's Got Issues,1,16 February 2007,"Mel Gibson really does need to get some help--both psychological and cinemagraphic. The first half of this thing is almost exclusively lovingly shot scenes of various pieces of graphic violence that most closely resemble a fetishistic porn film. The violence and gore goes WAY beyond making any sort of point and seem included because Gibson thinks his audience will get off on it. The second half of the film is nothing but a long series of rehashed clichés that were tired even as long ago as The Naked Prey. The lone hero, armed only with his wits and ridiculous luck, runs from a party of evil hunters and picks them off one-by-one only to survive and live happily ever after (which I suppose is a spoiler but anyone who didn't see this one coming needs to get out more often). Gibson's only change to this cliché-fest is his addition of a bizarre birthing pool and the arrival (in true deus ex machina form) of the Europeans.All of this might actually work had Gibson bothered developing any characters the audience could identify with or if he had actually followed up on the portentous (pretentious?) quote about the decay of civilizations that opens the film. But Gibson and his co-writer seem incapable of doing either so the surface-level depictions of the decaying (Mayan? Aztec? It's really not at all clear.) civilization and the hero's escape provide no emotional engagement at all.Finally, this thing makes me wonder anew about the ""average American parents"" that supposedly make up the MPAA's ratings board. I find it frightening that these folks are so afraid of simulated depictions of sexual penetration that they monitor those to the millisecond, yet they apparently think nothing about extended graphic scenes of violent penetrations (with arrows, spears, knives) and dismemberment. If ever a film deserved an NC-17 (or whatever they're calling it these days) for graphic depictions of violence, this one did.",Apocalypto
484,jon-fougner-966-434081,Reflections from YLS Capitalism + Film Seminar,4,1 February 2013,"IntroductionFrom writer-director-producer Mel Gibson's insanely bestial brain comes Apocalypto, set in the jungle as the neighboring Mayan kingdom crumbles. He opens the film with a ham-fisted quotation that great civilizations are destroyed from within, a caveat that would prove equally prophetic with regard to Gibson's own mind. Facially, the root of the collapse is an economic failure—the withering of Mayan agriculture—but the civilization's (and by extension, our protagonist's) vulnerability to such a shock rests in the imperfection of information characterizing the markets in which it traffics. Beset by an ignorance that must have felt native, so to speak, to Gibson himself, the film's subjects revert to the base layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs—sustenance, safety and, of particular note, family. The deadliest offspring of ignorance is fear, and it is only by fearlessly reclaiming terra firma for himself and his lineage that our hero Jaguar Paw can prevail. Never one to go easy on his protagonists, however, Gibson leaves Jaguar Paw and who's left of his nemeses at the mercy of the New Industry and New God of the White Man, who first steps ashore in the film's final frames.I. Imperfect InformationImperfect information is devastating to the efficient allocation of resources in Apocalypto's primitive capitalism. The film opens with a successful boar hunt by a well-coordinated team of a half dozen forest people. As the organs (the prizes!) are doled out according to favor or virtue—we're not quite sure which—the runt of the bunch is proffered the testicles and assured they will rid his impotence. But all they rid is his stomach, of its lunch. This gullible consumer and his virility take a one-two punch when a fellow hunter urges him to ""apply generously"" a poisonous plant to invigorate his nether-parts. The ensuing slapstick is hilariously embarrassing not only because it is groin humor but more so because it means laughter at ignorance—one of the harshest sorts. The ignorance and harshness continue, but not the laughter. A brutal frog march away lies yet another imperfect market for body parts—human ones. The buyers? Who else—the gods. The Mayans have been wrongheadedly sacrificing captives to the heavens in search of respite from their crop plague. Their latest offering is to be Jaguar Paw and his fellows, wrested from their village with all manner of Gibsonian sadism. In the nick of time, the nick of the blade is arrested by the apparent omen of a solar eclipse, and the market failure of this particular chopping block is cured as one ignorance defeats another. II. Estate Law in the JungleWith the value of goods (fleshly or otherwise) so ambiguous, family is coin of the realm. The indicia of fertility—wombs, breasts, penises, infants and mothers—are revered and their brutalization or sale is cringed at. An occasional tangible asset such as a knife is momentously granted by one generation to the next, true, but the real endowment bestowed upon one's progeny is the forest itself—and knowledge of it. Apocalypto's Gibsonian turn—that moment when his abused protagonist takes a deep breath and finds the fortitude to unleash hell on his oppressors—comes when Jaguar Paw calls up the waterfall to his pursuers, announcing that he owns the forest, just like his father before him. We've heard this trope before, but it is now that the audience enjoys its first assurance that his forebears' bequest has been honored by the Mother Nature and that his inherited knowledge of Her will carry the day. And it does. From mud, to bees, to a poisonous frog, Jaguar Paw's preternatural intuitions for tapping the commons in a sustainable way (the frog hops off after he draws its poison, for example) win him a fate happier than that of the boar hunted in the film's first scene.ConclusionBut not much happier. All the while, the Europeans have been divvying up labor, among shipbuilding, proselytizing, and (we assume) weapons crafting. The result is an armada making landfall on Jaguar Paw's beach, and making his epic struggle with his would-be executors seem a trifle. These new guests, we fear, may care even less for our hero's life—let alone his scheme of real and personal property.",Apocalypto
485,bamcubz,Agreed,10,15 September 2007,"Makes you forget its in another language, you just get so absorbed in it. Even the brutality of it so raw and in your face. Yet still able to show you love between a man and a wife, or a mother and child; compassion - even when it involves your mother-in-law; pranks - adults never loose their sense of humor. Its a timeless piece set in an ancient world, so not only are you given a history lesson, it works in showing you that the same emotions apply in today's time. Mel Gibson did a wonderful job with the story, the actors/actresses, costumes, it all just worked together perfectly.

486,arlmovies,Hollywood Movie with Mayan Background,7,10 December 2006,"I just got back from watching the movie I have looked forward to all year. I admit to having high expectations of this film, perhaps too high of expectations, because they weren't met. I looked forward to this movie, because for the most part, Hollywood doesn't seem to want to do any movie on the Aztecs or the Mayans, or anything like that even though it's a very fascinating subject, with an even more fascinating culture and a rich history. I think that's why the movie didn't work for me, I wanted to see the culture, the history, everything that makes this extinct group of people so interesting. I'm not saying the movie is bad, because it is an okay movie, it just doesn't answer any of my questions about the Mayan Civilization. But if a person doesn't know anything about them, then the movie will shock them. A Mel Gibson signature is once again pointed out on how much beatings the human body can take, and I'm not sure all the violence was necessary. But for anyone who feels like seeing movie that is semi different, then watch this one, because it has all the right elements, it just didn't work for me. Antony",Apocalypto
487,rterrell2,Great Flick,8,8 December 2006,"Just as films go, this is a winner. I loved it start to finish. I am a big Mel Gibson fan. Yes he has done some dumb things but I think it's possible to separate career of someone away from their personal life. But anyway on to my humble opinion on his film. This film is never boring and those who hate reading their movies might want to stay away. But if you want to be put into a world of the past and feel like you live there. This film is for you. I think a lot of people are confused about what this movie is. It is not an accurate telling of the end of the Mayans, but an adventure in their world. I recommend this film to anyone who loves well created worlds because Gibson does that and then some. Also the characters are great and I found myself not feeling in anyway alienated by their ways. They are people,not savages,well at least not all off them. The action is well done on top of awesome sets and amazing makeup and wardrobes. put your feelings for Gibson aside and check this out.",Apocalypto

This movie has the perfect elements of the genre of action and adventure and also is one of the most violent movies that I've seen it. Apocalypto contains the best and long extended foot-chase in cinema history, fifty minutes of pure action. What Mel Gibson has directed here is like an ultra violent yet very entertaining action/adventure film. Curiously though the movie has not known actors, the movie can be awesome. Apocalypto is the first movie that show how the Mayans were marvelous, is more tan a movie, is an experience. A truly classic.",Apocalypto

A couple of hours of a guy being tortured, everybody spoke an ancient language which hardly anybody knows nowadays, and it was saying ""Oh hurray Christianity!"", even though it didn't really teach us anything about Christianity except that Jesus suffered a lot of pain.What is Apocalypto? A couple of hours of a guy who's having a really bad day, everybody speaks an ancient language, and Christianity, can anybody guess? Yes Christianity is our hero, even though there wasn't anything about Christianity in the movie.The difference between Apocalypto and Passion of the Christ is that the guy actually fights back. Instead of just being tortured for a long time, this man is on a mission, and has to do some justified killing along the way.This movie was worthless. All there was to it were some fancy props, a lot of gory action scenes, and a message about how Christianity is a good thing. It had no plot, no meaning, and left me wondering ""why did I watch this movie?"".

490,tile46,Violence!!!,5,29 December 2006,"To start of I must stress that I love over the top gore. I love violence and action. Even I, on occasion, like a good old human sacrifice. So this movie was a real excitement for me. One of the most important things I ever learned about film was that things you don't show on screen are always scarier than what you do show, because your audience gets to imagine it in it's most frightening form, but showing it is awesome as well. Mel Gibson went out of his way to show you all the stuff you would rather not see. Within the first 25 minutes of this movie, someone eats raw pig balls and another guy holds his own still beating heart in front of him. It just gets bloodier and bloodier from then on.To address the issue that a lot of people brought up. This movie was not racist at all. This movie was about the Mayan upper class destroying them selves and the lower class with them. But, while the movie was for the most part a very accurate representation of the Mayans at the time there was one blaring flaw in it's accuracy and in it's message. In the end the main character is fleeing (because that's about all he ever does) when he comes to the shore to find a Spanish expeditionary force and conquistadors with bibles and crosses in hand. I though at once that Mel's crazy ""God"" obsession might just ruin a perfectly good gore fest. Luckily for me the movie ended soon after. But the after taste was sower. Now all I could think was ""The Spanish saved him?"" They, in a way, did. There arrival distracted the followers and all of a sudden, he was OK. Thanks buddies! But wait, in the beginning of this movie Mel posts a Will Durant quote about nations destroying themselves, well I've got bad news for Mel. The Spanish arrived 300 years after the Mayan empire fell and most likely, though they might have saved our beloved jaguar paw they probably would have killed him within 5 or so years. This is kind of like having a movie about a polish boy being picked on end with the Nazis coming in and saving him. The Spanish were responsible for possibly the largest genocide in human history. They killed 9 million natives in their conquest. In all the movie was enjoyable despite Mel's obvious craziness. I would suggest seeing it and just leaving before the end.",Apocalypto

492,RabidCerebral,excellent,9,10 December 2006,"I just watched Apalcalytpo tonight, and all i can say is wow, this is new breed of film, it has a whole new feeling that i have never really experienced in a movie. most movies we see regarding natives of any sort depict them as animals, much more unintelligent then the ""great white man"" but this movie showed they are people just like us who experience emotions and feelings, and that they know a lot more then us regarding where they live. the atmosphere in this movie is great i loved the kill or be killed theme it is non stop heart pounding action thought the entire movie and i never wanted the movie to end, i can rarely say that about a movie. the emotions and feeling aroused in this movie were very strong and vivid such as fear, love, agony etc. it was extremely interesting to see these totally different cultures, and see how they go about their lives, and how they act and the way they look. the tattoos and piercings were very beautiful in their own respect, it was very interesting and totally pleasing to the eye.i am very pleased that Mel Gibson made the movie subtitled it would of ruined it if it was in English or dubbed, in order to get everything out of the movie and get the overall feeling of legitimacy and atmosphere you have to have everything as realistic as possible including the native language.i am slightly disappointed to see Mel make the Mayans look to be the by far the underdog tribe when they really are in fact an extremely smart tribe. i mean they are masters of time after all, but there was reference to this with the Aztecs in the movie. i was also happy to see an eclipse added to this movie, considering that the Mayans and Aztecs find this of utmost importance, and also considering that they made a prediction that the earth would shift and move into higher consciouses in Dec 21st 2012 on a day with a eclipse. i find it amazing that they could foresee something like that 1000s of years ago, it has been backed up by our sciences as true.there is much speculation on how the movie is very gory, very disturbing and totally overdone and unnecessary. give me a freaking break people, this movie is not even close to the most goriest film ever made, and nothing is unnecessary it all builds atmosphere and emotion, if you cant handle this then i don't know what to say, you need to harden a bit its a violent world get used to it. i would recommend watching cannibal Holocaust before seeing this movie if you consider yourself bothered by gore and violence, it would get you used to anything and makes this movie seem just fine and more enjoyable.all in all I'm finding myself thinking a lot about this movie, it really is sticking in my mind, i cant explain it, its like nothing i have seen, it is a new level of film making, so go see it perhaps it is not for everyone, i mean i think it is gore everyone but I'm just saying that from the shocking things I've been hearing about how people hate this movie etc. all i can say is that i loved it and also that my 12 year old sister loved it, so if a 12 year old girl can handle this movie then you have absolutely no excuse like seriously all you people saying its too confusing and too gory need to open your minds and see something new and refreshing not the usually Hollywood prepackaged mush. Mel Gibson is a great director and i would say this is his best film, you can see a lot of his style in this movie, there are many similarities in this movie with brave heart and passion of Christ so if you liked those two then go see it, but if you haven't seen those two movies then well, go see it.and one more final note, for all of you boycotting the movie just because of what Mel Gibson said in his drunken escapade, get over it don't give up an excellent movie just because of the director, you still can hate him, but that doesn't mean you need to hate and for go a great movie.",Apocalypto

Although it does receive a high IMDB rating of 7.8, it most certainly should have been more well-received and better represented at the Academy Awards and all other awards for that year. I am NOT a Mel Gibson sympathizer and am not aligned with his political views or his anti-Semitic leanings, both of which I believe negatively impacted this movie's chances at the Academy Awards. This film should have been nominated for more than just the three nominal awards it did receive. In addition to those three, it most certainly should have been nominated for Best Movie, Best Director, and Best Editing while the omission of any acting nominations is also conspicuous. Raoul Trujillo, Gerardo Taracena, and Rudy Youngblood all gave absolutely top notch performances, most noticeably Trujillo and Taracena whose menacing and antagonistic characters were extremely believable and convincing.",Apocalypto

It is in a language almost forgotten, with unknown actors and with a history of America most would like to forget: The Mayans and northern conquerors showing their savagery and cannibal ways. Nevertheless, the movie still captures your imagination and heart. Wow! Anybody that has lived in, or read about North America (although many still wrongly place Mexico in Central or South America) will be touched by this film. Apocalypto is probably the best film ever made about our American civilizations excesses, and quite appropriately directed by one of the most gutsy creative actors / directors of all times: Mel Gibson. The movie is amazing from beginning to end. As far as I'm concerned, it is a masterwork, with outstanding visuals and historically entrenching experiences. Some would like to forget about the human sacrifices and the gore the Amerindians practiced, but the movie is a proper reminder of that past. You become one with the film, with the history, with the hero's aim of saving his family, and with all the action. It properly ends with the Spanish arrival to America.

496,XeniaisGod,I've got a sinking feeling that Mel Gibson likes to torture kittens in his spare time.,1,10 December 2006,"Why disguise a C-level slasher flick as an historical epic? If your true calling as a director is directing films that are thin on plot and gratuitously violent, why not just direct The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part Deux? This film was marketed as a lavish historical epic chronicling the last days of the Mayan civilization, and one would expect to see a film that had something to say about decadence and political corruption. Hardly a new theme, but if done properly it could have made for an entertaining film. Unfortunately Mel Gibson fails to execute even this minor task. As in Braveheart, which WAS an entertaining film, Gibson paints his characters in black or white. They are two-dimensional ""good guys"" or ""bad guys."" In Braveheart, the English and their Scottish co-conspirators are Eeeeeevil, as are the Mayan elite in Apocalypto who are practically drooling blood from their grinning mouths. This is called pulp, which when treated by someone with an ounce of wit (i.e. Tarantino), is fair game. However, Mel Gibson isn't witty but painfully earnest, and thus his violent formula is disturbing rather than entertaining. I won't even address this film's glaring historical inaccuracies, other than to say that Hollywood rarely delivers in this regard and one no longer expects it to.This convoluted, meandering film was either one of three things: 1. A failed epic in love with its own pornographic violence. There was no point to the violence as there was no point to the film. 2. A subversive propaganda tool which painted the Mayans as bloodthirsty savages whose own wrongdoing earned them their downfall. The final scene showed the arrival of the Europeans, which we know spelled a new world order for Mayans who had so suffered under their own leaders' excesses. 3. A film whose only point is to say that violence is pointless and inescapable. I say this in light of the final scene in which the two mains have escaped the ruin of the city, and instinctively also veer away from the approaching Europeans. They decide to ""go to the forest"" in hopes of living out their lives in peace, away from the destructiveness of all civilization. The point in this case, is very bleak, since we can assume that they won't be able to escape no matter how far they run, and will likely perish from smallpox or some other disease within a few years. Or they will escape and become the descendants of generations of Maya leading into today.But who knows what Mel Gibson is attempting to say with this picture? I certainly don't. I base my one-star rating on guesses 1. and 2. I suppose if his motivations are more in tune with 3., then we would have at least something of a theme, and as such my rating could go up to 5. or 6. But I really will never know because if he is in fact making a point such as the one I have guessed at in 3., he fails in his utter vagueness and leaves us with a film that is ultimately disappointing, if not entirely offensive!",Apocalypto
497,simonk_h,"Different, thus very good",9,16 January 2007,"If the Oscars are not as narrow-minded as I think they are, they will, at the very least, nominate this movie for it's costume design and make up. They were just phenomenal! It is difficult to praise Mel Gibson considering what a t*sser he seems to be but just because the man has personality problems doesn't mean he can't make great movies. If that were the case then we may as well discard most director's works. This is a wonderfully shot movie and thoroughly exciting. I don't think I have seen such great action pieces since 'Heat' and certainly the major set piece at the religious festival was incredible and brilliantly realised! If the Mayan descendants think that Gibson is presenting them as savages then they obviously didn't look too closely at this movie. All I saw was a very clever people who were miles ahead of those in others parts of the world and easily equally civilised to those in Europe at the time. Just because they didn't wear as many layers of clothing doesn't mean that they were retarded. Look at the temples in the city. Is that not an achievement above and beyond the turf huts that the Vikings and the Anglo-Saxons were living in in 900 a.d.? Of course the gore quota was pretty damn high, particularly when Jaguar Paw whacks his nemesis across the head and the wound has blood spraying out. Pretty disgusting! But that didn't get in the way of the acting which was excellent right across the board. Especially considering that they were unknowns and first-timers (reminded me of that Australian film 'The Magician'). The characters were fleshed out enough to make you care for what happened to them and the heartbreak that they go through. All in all, a great movie and a wonderful effort by Mel Gibson.

A couple of times I almost turned it off, it was so intense. But the beautiful characters and their journey sucked me it. It was obvious it was far more than than just a gory snuff flick so I persevered. And I was so rewarded. It was an amazing journey of brutality and survival and light historical contexts thrown in to make it all the more believable.
I had no idea it was a big budget film for quite a while, the actors and scenes are so believable in setting. It was like they had villagers help with a story. As the movie progressed and got more fantastic I was even more impressed and it became apparent it was more than just a local movie from a small group of people. Subtle nuances were great in the film. The attention to detail is exceptional.

502,CharlesAncelle,One of the most thrilling action movies ever made.,10,22 January 2016,"This may be a somewhat controversial statement, but I think Apocalypto is probably one of the most underrated movies of the past decade.I re-discovered it recently and I honestly think it is one of the most incredible action movies ever, and for several reasons: - First of all, it is an absolutely immersing experience: the language, the costumes and production design, the introduction scene, the lack of recognizable faces - we feel immediately transported into Pre-Colombian central America and we believe we are there, period, which is honestly a rarity for a period piece.The characters are instantly likable and I think the fact that again, there aren't any recognizable faces is really a plus in this case, and the acting is top notch.It takes a little while for the action to get started. Unlike most modern action films for which the action starts five to ten minutes into the film generally, this one takes its time to build character, take you into that foreign world. You travel with the protagonist and discover everything with him, which means that by the time the action really starts, you are completely invested in him, and the stakes have become much higher than usual.Once the action begins, which is really just a giant chase sequence similar to Mad Max: Fury Road, it doesn't stop, and it keeps you at the edge of your seat until the very end, and I don't think there is any film that does action quite like this. The camera work, the editing, the rhythm and sound design all converge together to make you feel every little detail as if you were there, and I found my heart beating faster until the very end.Now, is there a strong character arc in this film? No, but it doesn't matter, it's not what the film is about, it's not even about the downfall of civilization, it's just about a man trying to reunite with his wife and kid, and that's all it needs to be to make for an incredible and unique experience!",Apocalypto
503,slapmonkeyfilms,Disappointing preachy epic,3,10 December 2006,"Mel Gibson returns to the directors chair with this Mayan epic Apocalypto. And unfortunately he's still as preachy as ever. Not content with thrusting his views upon us as he did with his tale of Jesus in The Passion of the Christ, his follow up leaves you feeling like you've taken part in a repetitious sermon. The story follows a tribe of Aztecs as they are attacked in their forest home by a rival tribe, enslaved then taken to an Aztec city to be sold on or sacrificed. One of the captured, Jaguar Paw, manages to escape their clutches and then we get a 'race against time' as he charges through the forest seeking the wife and child he left behind. It's all interesting enough and flows along at a decent pace, the problem lies as i mentioned with the preachyness that flows through the film. His message of religion and how we should live our lives courses through the celluloid leaving a bitter taste. Also the treatment of the Mayans and their culture is just plain patronising, Gibson makes no attempt to display a point of view instead settling with painting a black and white good versus evil struggle. There is no blurring of boundaries with good old Mel around. To make matters worse the film seems to be made up of set pieces borrowed from other movies. You'll notice the dam jump from The Fugitive amongst many others. On the plus side the sumptuous locations are a delight to look at. But it's hard to get past the underlying message that ruined my enjoyment of what could have been an excellent film.",Apocalypto
504,falicethemalice,apocolypt no!,3,25 February 2008,"this film is garbage, no effort, creativity, or originality went into this film, sorry Mel but you have failed on so many levels. what does this film offer that no other does?... hmmm let's see absolutely nothing and I can't get my head around how this film got 7.9 stars out of ten, but then again I can't seem to get my head that far up my ass. The film has some mildly suspenseful scenes but that's not saying much. It's a formulaic film, all mel does is have the plot and backdrop take place in ancient times with the mayans. I must add that I did not want to watch this film my friend insisted. The main character Almost, is wanted dead by the bad guys(I forget their name) throughout most of the film he is chased by these men, while trying to get to his son and pregnant wife who are stuck in a hole. Overall this film is a waste of time, instead of making a film that makes you think, mel goes for the entertainment value and loses substance by doing so and creates a pretty predictable, bland film. I give 3/3 but that's just me",Apocalypto

Give me a break! If your going to claim the movie from the start is on the Maya actually do it on the Maya! Mel Gibson has gone beyond being a bigot in this movie. Shame on you Mel Gibson Stop pawning off false uneducated claims of history into your movies. I mean just look at the Patriot, and know you shouldn't touch this film with a ten foot pole. Run away from this farce of a movie, watch the first half if you must and then ask for a refund! 1/2 a star for the fact a movie on the Maya has finally been made!",Apocalypto
508,desalvo_j,Good film,7,10 June 2007,"This film had a lot of action and was very suspenseful. I would have to say that the film seemed to follow history accurately as far as Mayans being brutal; this film had a lot of violence, blood and gore. On the ""down side"" this films gritty scenes seemed to rehearsed and unrealistic. The scenes in the Mayan city had an air of Disney fakeness, I just wasn't convinced. But this was an overall good film. I would watch it again; it had a lot of by-the-seat-of-your-pants action and great hand-to-hand combat scenes. Mel Gibson did a great job on this film. I would highly recommend this film to adults, but due to the extreme violence would recommend caution for the younger viewers, sorry but this film is loaded to the hilt with blood and gore.",Apocalypto
509,missnavymoo2,Fantastic movie,10,12 May 2009,"I love this movie! Every time it's on, I watch it and I'm fixated and transformed. And though this may not have been Mel Gibson's intention, I want to learn more about the culture on which this is based. Why do I like this movie so much? It's imaginative, it's non-stop, it's realistic, it's believable and it tells a story. The protagonist, Jaguar Paw, is a real hero but he's not just a savage. Mr. Gibson does a magnificent job of showing this tribe of Mayans as all-too human -- from playing pranks on Blunt, the tribe member whose wife cannot conceive children to the raid on the village and the resultant march to slavery and certain death --- and it was all totally gripping. The little boy who plays Turtles Run was so cute and the woman who plays Blunt's mother-in-law was very funny. And I loved Flint Sky, Jaguar Paw's father. But the most credit must go to Rudy Youngblood, the young man who plays Jaguar Paw. I cheered him, I was scared for him and I praised him for his courage. I know Jaguar Paw is only a character but he seemed so real! Some of the scenes are incredibly violent and graphic but this was essential in order to understand fully what was happening to Jaguar Paw and his fellow captives. I see why Mel Gibson fell in love with Costa Rica (though I could never take the heat and humidity). The forests were incredibly lush, the animals were wonderful and the scenery of the raiders' village was overwhelming. I wish a book had been written about the making of this movie or, better yet, a post-movie book in the same vein as ""Fireproof"" and ""Facing the Giants."" Right now, Mr. Gibson is mired in a lot of personal trouble; I hope he sees this new review of ""Apocalypto"" and finds some relief from his troubles. I recommend this movie most highly! If there was a ""message"" in this movie, I didn't see it. I just think this movie is an enjoyable, wonderful picture. I watch movies to be entertained (and this one did it wonderfully). If I want a message, I'll go to Mass, I'll read the newspaper or I'll watch EWTN. Messages have their place but this wasn't it.",Apocalypto
510,r-j-b08,A poor movie from Gibson,6,3 November 2008,"This film is one of the most disappointing films I have seen yet. The gore is too frequent but yet, surprisingly quite soft (compared to say, Dawn of the-Dead or Freddy Versus Jason), although some bits do go into the extreme. It's story is very poor and cheesy, the camera style is a poor quality shake style and the characters are unimaginative. However, it is quite realistic in some aspects and the opening scenes are good until the raid, even though the jungle seems to be from an Indiana Jones movie. Overall I think you should go to this movie, but you may walk out disappointed. I gave it a 6 out of ten for reasons I have previously explained, plus for the fact that in some parts, it lacked the gore quantities, which I never thought I'd say for a Mel Gibson movie.",Apocalypto
511,rodduncan-1,Almost a really great movie,7,26 August 2008,"The man in the box office frowned as I offered my money. ""You do know it's not in English, don't you?"" Presumably he'd had complaints from customers thinking they were going into a standard Hollywood action thriller. But a film set just before the collapse of classical Mayan civilisation, directed by Mel Gibson, was always going to be subtitled.No one knows why the Mayan civilisation fell. The remnants of great cities, complete with vertiginous pyramids, were rediscovered by explorers hacking into the jungle during the last century. All seem to have been abandoned long before Europeans reached the Americas. Apocalypto opens in the forests of the Yucatan peninsular at some unspecified time in history. Our hero, Jaguar Paw, is one of a group of men hunting game. We see village life and the ominous image of refugees from some terrible event walking through in search of new lands to settle. The fall from grace comes swiftly. A raiding party destroys the village in an orgy of explicitly depicted violence. Those who are not killed are captured and bound, with the exception of our hero's pregnant wife and child, who he secretes in a deep pit  a place that will be both their hiding place and their grave - if he can't get back to rescue them in time. Jaguar Paw and his friends are then lead off towards a fate they don't know but which we can guess. For the Mayans apparently practised human sacrifice on an industrial scale. ""Come back to me,"" his wife pleads, which sets up all that follows.For me the high point of this movie was the journey towards the apex of a pyramid and an appointment with a razor-sharp ceremonial knife. We pass from their forest home through landscapes increasingly despoiled, past the pox ridden and a starving population. We feel the bewilderment of Jaguar Paw and his companions as they are dragged through environments as alien to us as they are to him. They reach the city with its crowds of tattooed, scarified and pierced men and women, up to the place of death where sit the corrupt and corpulent heads of a civilisation heading for its apocalypse. For that journey alone it was worth seeing this movie. Also for the fascinating array of faces, each beautifully individual and distinctly non-Hollywood. But what followed - a substantial chunk of the film  though gripping in action terms, felt wildly improbable. And the ending, which I won't give away here, seemed to me starkly anachronistic. I do admire Mel Gibson for producing movies that he wants to make rather than pursuing an ideal of middle-of-the-road commercialism. But ultimately Apocalypto left me with the sense of an opportunity missed. This could have been a great film.",Apocalypto
512,Hello-Beautiful,Visceral Gibson Goodness,7,22 March 2013,"This definitely has the very vivid & visceral taste of a true Mel Gibson film. As controversial as Gibson may be, his mastery of film-making exudes from Apocalypto. It feels so much like the Patriot, but has an ending that might satisfy some more.Besides the violence, the other Gibson-isms you have to look forward to with Apocalypto are the rich cinematography & his obvious deep family values. His films are always fueled by the emotion he wraps around the protagonist protecting his family. All the characters are characteristically loyal, passionate, traditional & protective of their way of life.The part of the film that might be overlooked that I really loved was the portrayal of the deep empowerment you see in the characters. While it may be more realistic to have a flawed main character, it is very satisfying to an idealist when you see (the rare) abounding love of the family, empowerment of a strong wife & protective nature of a husband.The key to the fascination of this film is that you take a deep look & feel invested into the tribe & characters for some time before you are unceremoniously, visually & emotionally assaulted right along with them by their assailants. To me, it felt like a small ending right in the middle of the movie.The CONs of Apocalypto are really a few predictable plot elements & the legitimacy of the history behind it.There is a bit of a question about whether this is about the Mayans really. It's true that the Spanish conquistadors first came in contact with Mayans, but the more brutal, less intellectual & short lived reign of the Aztecs seems to more accurately fit this movie's portrayal of the civilization.All in all, it's worth a one-time watch.",Apocalypto
513,piet-vandenbrande,Best movie of the year,10,12 March 2007,"This movie is excellent because of the photography, the storyline and its humanism. The relation between son and father is very well depicted and really moving. The battle scenes are great. The ritual for the killing is majestic! This is the first time I see a movie which is going so quickly, with its slow moments and with its accelerations. This is not really a horrific movie, the cruelty stays between the limits of human understanding. It is true that Maya's had also their offering rituals just like the Aztecs, but the Maya's took slaves for their offerings just as shown in the film. The costumes of the priests are really well done. so the movie is historically correct.",Apocalypto

515,differentbutsimple,What a load of Mayans,3,27 January 2007,"This film has come under quite a lot of criticism about the ""extreme"" violence shown in the film and its historical in-accuracy. I find myself feeling that I need to defend it on both these counts.Historically In-accurate True Or False?The main point that is brought up against the film is that Mayan civilisation collapsed around 900AD and therefore had not existed for around 700 years at the time the film was set (which would be quite a blunder!). This however is not correct (Well from what I can tell from Wikipedia ;) ). The Mayan civilisation is still around today - in some form. It underwent a collapse around 900AD moving from its most prosperous ""Classic"" period to its ""Post- Classic"" period which survived up until Westerner settlers invaded.What is wrong with this film is that the styles of buildings, rituals and historical details seem to be picked at random from different periods of Mayan civilisation. It appears that Mell Gibson has tried to compress the whole decline of the Mayan civilisation, all 700 or so years into about a week and a half!Extreme Violence Or A Night In With The TV?I'll say it from the off set this film does not live up to its reputation for ""extreme"" violence. Whilst it does contain a respectable amount of spurting blood but this is not much worse that something you would see on CSI or ER. The fighting is less stylised than most films, mostly involving picking up the nearest blunt weapon and bludgeoning someone with it, but most of the violence is inferred happening of camera. People have mentioned scenes of people being raped, this does not happen. I'm not suggesting this doesn't happen in the film but that it is never shown. They don't even put the sound of screaming in to tell you that it is happening it is entirely left up to your imagination.It is the sacrifices that most critics seem to be criticising. These are mostly shown from the point of view of the Mayan towns people standing at the bottom of the temple steps which is a long distance away from the sacrifices. The main exception to this is when a bloody heart that has been taken from one of the victims is held aloft which is shown close up, but I seem to remember this being done in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom which was a PG!What it does contain in abundance is brutality and savagery. It is impressed and re- impressed upon the viewer that the Mayan peoples were savage, both in appearance and their behaviour. They shown to be sadistic, killing for sport or getting pleasure out of the suffering of others. This does not happen in an isolated way it is the whole driving force of the film. From the murdering, raping (yes I know what I said...but my imagination definitely stretched as far as there being rapes) and pillaging carried out by the Mayan soldiers to the trance like ecstasy of the jeering crowds at the temple steps and the bloodthirsty hunt for the films hero, Jaguar Paw.Special consideration is given to the simple hunter / gatherer tribes men that are the focus of the films story. They are exempted from the cruelly that drives the men of the Mayan civilisation by living out a slightly oafish existence in balance with nature and the forest. It is these tribesmen that the film follows in particular Jaguar Paw who is the son of the village chief.Historical Nightmare Or Popcorn Classic?For all its faults its historical confusion it must be said that Apocolypto does look great from the wildness of the forests to the bleak landscapes of the limestone mines and Mayan temples. With that comes a fast paced action (chase) movie with a stroke of historical colour - inaccurate as it may be. This could be an enjoyable film if it weren't for one flaw in its production.That flaw is the constant contempt shown by the film makers for the people that are its subject. It seems to be an all out attack on the Mayan civilisation. The characters that are portrayed are not people but stereotypes of savages, and their mindless aggression eventually becomes comical. The climax of the film says it all where the Westerners arrive rowing ashore from their galleons in their clean white clothes, carrying crosses.",Apocalypto
516,petroname,Apocalypto is another masterpiece movie from Mel Gibson,9,27 December 2006,"Apocalypto is another masterpiece movie from Mel Gibson. The first great feeling I got right after the movie ended is: I have just participated in exciting, colorful, full of adventures journey in jungle. I was a fan of Gibson's movies, especially after his The Passion of the Christ. Right after I watched this movie I said to myself: I will not miss any new movie by Mel Gibson in the future. I like every aspect in this movie. The film is great from all prospective. I loved sound editing and music. The picture quality is always great throughout the entire movie. Cinematography is perfectly done. Gibson is known as perfectionist in movie making. He pays attention to every single detail. That's why he produces great movie products. The movie is shot in Mayan language with English subtitles. It may seem that it isn't convenient to read the subtitles during the entire movie. But this adds realism to the movie and makes you totally absorbed into the movie.To all critics of the movie regarding to historical mistakes etc I want to say that, folks, this is ENTERTAINING movie, not a documentary for learning about Mayan/Aztecs civilizations purposes.

517,magonzalez_co,An unsophisticated and one-dimensional representation of the Maya Empire,3,7 January 2007,"This film is an unsophisticated and one-dimensional representation of the Maya Empire. It definitely portrays the Mayas as humanoids driven exclusively by instinctual aggression, destroyers of earth and humanity, who needed to be saved by Europeans otherwise they would have shattered the entire universe. The film totally avoids showing any evidence of civilization in an empire which had written language, sophisticated knowledge of architecture, mathematics and astronomy; and with a rich cultural and social system. The story of the film, is chronological linear, and everything occurs within 48 hours.Nevertheless, it has to be admitted that Mel Gibson achieves to maintain the levels of tension of the audience throughout the entire movie. Doubtless it is a good chase action movie, in which Jaguar Paw is persecuted by fear, nightmares, Mayas, jaguars, arrows, and rain.If you are looking for a bloody action movie go to watch it, you won't be disappointed. But if you are interested in the Maya civilization, don't even bother!!",Apocalypto
518,blackdragoon_13,One of the greatest adventure films of all time!,10,5 February 2015,"Beautiful movie in so many ways. First of all, the subtle message about the collapse of civilization and what makes us go there: greed for power, corruption and, above all, fear. I liked the treatment of fear as a disease but also as something inherently human that we must overcome despite the circumstances. Secondly, the visuals are quite impressive, even if almost 10 years have transpired since the filming of this piece of art. The jungles, the ornaments, etc. Everything fits perfectly in place, even if it is a Little anachronistic or wrong in some way. But keep in mind that this movie was made by an Australian, it has to have little holes on the historical accuracies. Even with this, I think that Mel Gibson made a valiant effort: no one until him made a movie with original dialect, real mayan people and filming in the country where all the story takes place (not the region, but almost). I, as Mexican, feel that no one could have made better this movie. And for the people that complains that there is so much blood and savagery in the film, well, history is just like that and in this case it happened (but with the aztecs, the mayan were more peaceful and not so war oriented). Real life is a bloodbath in every civilization from the past, present and maybe the future. Personally, I gave it 10 and recommend it to anyone who wants to expend two hours of quality entertainment mixed up with an important message. Hope you will enjoy it, and sorry for my poor English.",Apocalypto
519,nik-naren,awful,1,12 May 2007,"After I saw commercial crucification of Jesus in "" Last temptation of Christ"", I could understand the range of Mel Gibson. This film is none different., It seems that this man has got the habit of making some people walk over a large distance, effective torture on them, making them carry some heavy load.This movie also we can see the scene, where the tribal are made to walk tied on a piece of wood.This movie is another example of cultural assassination. Gross violence is portrayed on the scene.one and half hours of the movie, is nothing but torture, proving a point to the world that,see this was how they were, before them the Europeans came to the continent. People call traantino a mad man, cause he shows violence on screen, but his ways of showing violence are subtle and innovative, you could never feel the pain.This man, Mel has crossed all possible limits, trust me.I refer to (again) Amen. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280653/, where they don't even show a single torture scene and still make us feel sad for the plight of the Jews, see schindlers list, see the movie, shooting dogs, Mr, Gibson, you are too out of the way Watch it if you got nothing else to do",Apocalypto
520,sarahalub,The essence of human instincts,8,14 January 2007,"2007 has found its film of the year in the first month, and if this is anything to go by then hopefully it's a sign of things to come (we pray). This film is, in the simplest form, brilliant. Moving,thought provoking, disturbing and certainly not for the faint hearted, Apocalpypto deals with the basic primal instincts of man, and does it with passion and sincerity. The violence of man in his natural habitat, survival instincts, human suffering and our relationship and connection to the world we live in are all issues which are raised and highlighted.In all fairness, the critique of the film's violence is by no means an exaggeration, its a violent film. However within its context, the violence is not unnecessary; we're dealing with tribes. Looking at it from a Eurocentric viewpoint, its not easy for our oh so 'civilised' society to watch such acts of brutality without being unnerved, and dismissing them as the subconscious workings of a crazy director. However not only are these 'sickening' acts absolutely essential to the context as a whole, but they are essential in helping us to identify and relate to the characters and the events that take place.Killings, torture, rape, and brutality are key to this film, but alongside this are themes such as humanity, brotherhood, family and loyalty. This is life we're dealing with, and more to the point, ancient cultures.So if you're expecting a mind numbing action movie with loads of SFX this is the wrong movie to be watching(try smokin aces instead). Like The Passion Of Christ Apocalypto is by no means an easy film to watch, In fact Gibson makes sure you suffer with the characters for the entire two and a half hours . Like The Passion, its also not the type of film that you can watch 5 times with the same vigour.The cinematography and feel of this film is astounding. The whole texture of Apocalypto is authentic, and strives to stay away from 'action movie' territory. A key part of what makes a good film good is how believable the characters are, and these characters were excellent.A highly moving and very memorable affair, Gibson has yet again outdone himself.",Apocalypto
521,sdsmith5141,great movie,9,22 December 2006,This movie was great at showing the brutality of Indian culture. It really gets you pulling for the Indian's survival and rescue of his wife and son. It got a little monotonous toward the middle of the movie when they were in the mayan city and they showed the human sacrifices. It showed them chopping off about five peoples heads off and it just seemed like they stressed this too much. I was thinking OK we know that you sacrifice humans and chop their heads off and then throw it down the long staircase so lets get moving to the next part. The animal traps they set up are completely cool and he uses them to his advantage after his escape. This movie ranks up with Braveheart.,Apocalypto

Mel Gibson sets the film during the last phase of the great Mayan civilization and you, as an audience are literally transported to the time and location. The story follows one person- a young man named Jaguar Paw who has his entire village razed to the ground by an enemy clan. He is taken as a prisoner and the entire film is an escape journey featuring some of the most raw and graphic images ever put on film. The filmmakers went so far as to even create a new language- now this is dedication. If you haven't seen Apocalypto you owe it to yourself to see it as soon as you can- this is art.",Apocalypto
523,Movienator,Common movie in an exotic costume,7,27 May 2007,"Coming into this movie, all one heard was comments about Mel Gibson's violence, religious biases, and quirky behavior. Throw in the fact that the movie is presented in a foreign dialect with subtitles and you go into the theater expecting an exotic film. The sets and the costuming, along with the abundance of minority facial types reinforced this expectation and by the end many people will have thought they've just been through a meaningful film experience. In actuality, however, stripped of it's over garments, this movie is your basic action adventure with scenery. We start off with a happy domestic scene in the jungles of a Central American forest. As with most happy domestic scenes, it serves to set up the coming Anschluss as the bad guys move in and disrupt the happy times. As we accompany the victims through the jungles, we see the Mayan empire in it's human sacrificial peak. While there are a few diverting elements, the plot is pretty much standard stuff with few if any surprising twists. Give it a 7 for a good flow and sets. It should keep you occupied on a rainy day.",Apocalypto
524,frobrousa,Ambivalent Feelings,6,8 December 2006,"I had intended to boycott Mel Gibson, not for his recent personal problems, but for his awful waste of celluloid, ""The Passion of the Christ"". That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen: no real plot, no real character development, just a two-hour, slow-motion unfolding of physical torture. However, I saw the ""20/20"" episode on ""Apocalypto"" and was intrigued, plus Gibson charmed me with his charisma, and it seemed he was wrestling with some heavy themes in his new movie.Like ""The Passion"", ""Apocalypto"" takes place within a time span of roughly 24 hours. I wonder if Gibson is capable of directing a movie that unfolds over a longer time span. Like ""The Passion"", this movie deals with a lot of torture and human suffering--the ability to rise above one's suffering with superhuman willpower--as does every movie Gibson has starred in. However, he portrays suffering in a manner that does not increase the audience's empathy with the characters. It's like the true star of the movie is pain itself. Adrenaline can help a person overcome some amount of injury, but it becomes absurd. This is easily the bloodiest movie I've seen all year, so don't bring the kids.I had expected a thoughtful thesis on the fall of the Mayan civilization; instead, the viewer is treated to a caricature of human depravity. The protagonist is marched through successive levels of hell: out of his Eden, he witnesses disease, deforestation, and famine. Comparing the deforestation of the jungle to the loss of natural habitat that eventually became our modern world (New York City), one Mayan soldier quotes Ratso Rizzo, ""I'm walking here!"" In spite of its faults, this movie was visually engaging. The jungle, the people, the costumes, and the Mayan city were filmed well. Also, I did enjoy the action, especially shots of the protagonist running through the rain forest. He does grow as a character, even if his journey is the frequently visited journey from boyhood to manhood, a la ""The Jungle Book"".I was never bored during ""Apocalypto"", but I was never challenged, either. A more compelling movie dealing with similar issues is probably John Boorman's ""The Emerald Forest"".",Apocalypto
525,wind_highlander,One of the best movies of the year???,3,16 January 2007,"I live in Mexico and I've traveled to Yucatan. I live in Mexico now for more than 20 years.This is not a movie about the Mayan culture. This Mad Max Reloaded.First of all let's read again the plot outline: ""As the Aztec kingdom faces its decline, the rulers insist the key to prosperity is to build more temples and offer human sacrifices. Jaguar Paw (Youngblood), a young man captured for sacrifice, flees to avoid his fate."" It says the story is about the ""Aztec kingdom"". Sorry, it's about the Mayan Empire.Secondly, the thesis that avoiding decline means more temples and human sacrifices is just that, a thesis. It is a good plot, nothing more. The Mayan culture is still alive today, as more that 60% of Yucatan's population is Mayan!! Gibson couldn't have picked a more simplistic approach. The reasons for the Mayan decline are been studied to this day and everything is just more or less reasonable speculation.Thirdly, I quote: ""If anything the strange language only adds to the tone of exotic strangeness that pervades this unusually good and thrilling movie."" Well, they speak one of the modern dialects of the area, and only two characters spell it correctly: the young girl of the prophecy and an old man. All the rest, Youngblood included, just seem to read it. Real Mayan people that saw the film were indignant. Why didn't he use real Mayan actors?Fourthly, the film portrays violence in an ""American"" way (I'm Chilean and therefore American too. But the word has been kidnapped). This kind of violence is typical of ""American"" films. Everything is set on fire, crashed, crushed and killed. It's called entertainment. This kind of violence has nothing to do with the way Mayans used violence. Generally speaking, they certainly didn't enjoy violence for violence's sake, as the one guy laughing at the prisoner hanging over a cliff tied to a stick.Fifthly, what so cool about a story about one big, long persecution? A fast paced Rambo movie, that's all. What has that to do with Mayan culture? Sixthly, the main actors and actresses just don't look Mayan. If there's something at all to be said about Mayans is that they LOOK Mayan!!! They are so typical, you can tell right away who's Mayan and who's not. These poor guys looked like Navajos and Chicanos, but not Mayan. I'm joking, but you get my meaning here.Seventh, I've got to quote again: ""Its portrayal of the Mayan culture -- including its strange dress, hair styles, costumes, tattoos, body piercing, and decorative scars, as well as its industry, class system, cities, warfare, weapons, myth, and religion -- provide a bizarre and fascinating anthropological backdrop [...]"" Well, precisely what's missing most is a) a portentous display of Mayan culture and b) a rightful portrait of Mayan achievements. Both are sorely lacking in this movie. This a portrait of modern American culture transposed to the Mayan environment. Mayans are just a stand in for modern fantasies of a pseudo-American director. Mexican critics have mostly rejected the movie for savaging the Mayan culture. There's not a rightful understanding of the past in this movie, just an extrapolation of modern behaviors and stereotypes and fantasies upon a foreign culture.Eighth, why are all the inhabitants of the city so dumbed? They looked as if absent. Eerie looks everywhere, as if people were mad or something. Has Gibson been in a Mexican market? Does he know, I mean, really KNOW how Mexicans walk and talk and laugh and dream and buy stuff and look and examine things and eat food and sweat and sleep and just pass by? It seems not. Because that's where the movie more resembled a set in a Mad Max movie. This people were not real!!!! This was not a Mayan city! This is impossible!!! I mean, does he know, by god's sake how Mayans feel??????????? Ninth, the plot itself, a very simple one at that, doesn't help to understand the Mayan culture. Its underlying message is just about the law of the fittest, nothing more.About being smarter, faster and more powerful and about getting revenge. This is Rambo, this is Schwarzenegger, this is Hollywood. Mayan life had nothing to do with it. Climb up one of those beautiful pyramids-temples, watch the carvings, let your eyes wander over the jungle, look down at the ceremonial spaces between the pyramids, take a look at those incredibly old trees, breath in the incredible beauty of all those places.... and you'll understand why I'm writing this. This is not Marlboro country by God's sake! There's such poetry in the air, such art and majesty... how could he not have gotten that? Tenth, while we're at the pyramids... when you are up there... the scenery doesn't look like that. It doesn't look at all like that...so odd, so opaque, so weird. And, by the way, what a strange melange of Aztec and Mayan rituals, Mr. Gibson! - - The plot outline and the comment that appear on the first page just display this same lack of knowledge and appreciation. But that's the kind of target it was created for. Sadly. Too bad the rest of the world must learn from this very poor example how Mayans supposedly lived around 500 years ago.",Apocalypto
526,Ricky_Bozarth,immediate controversy,9,12 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's APOCALYPTO is an outstanding film,a dazzling visual feast that accomplishes what most epics fail to do:it never loses sight or touch with all the characters involved. Personally,I loved the film. I loved it so much that even though I stupidly drank 2 cups of coffee before the film,and immediately needed to go after the opening credits,I endured the entire 2hrs45 min+ running time without a bathroom break. There was just too much happening. However,as with everything involving Mel Gibson,there will be controversy about this film. The three main controversies I see are: 1) The intense,mind pummeling violence(especially in the sacrifice scene,which probably had more blood & gore then all of H.G.Lewis' films combined. 2) The film opens with a quote by philosopher & historian Will Durant that pretty much sets the tone for the film.""All civilizations destroy themselves from the inside before they're destroyed from the outside."" He's talking about Mayan civilization to a modern American audience,so this has to be a comment about the USA today. 3) At the end of the film,I scoured the credits for the SPCA disclaimer "" No animals were harmed in the making of this motion picture."" I didn't see it. I don't think it was there. I definitely think some animals might have had an 'oopsy' on the set. Does anyone know anything about this?",Apocalypto
527,clonesheep,Very good film but short of perfect,8,18 December 2006,"This film takes the viewers to an adventure and it's an authentic and exciting one. The place was Pre-Columbus Central America, where the Mayas lived. There're good and bad Mayas. Our hero was a good one who tried his best to escape certain death to save his family. The cinematography is wonderful. The actions are first rate. There're no well-known actors in this film although Rudy Youngblood could become one. All cast members, save 2 or 3, were native Americans. It's in Mayan with English subtitle but all of these were well done.My only minor complaint is that there're places where the violence was over the top -- could be better leaving it to the viewer's imagination. This makes the film unsuitable for viewing by younger people, who otherwise would have enjoyed the rest of the adventure.",Apocalypto
528,hdoug,Great flick (and a defense to charges of racism),7,24 June 2007,"I watched the DVD knowing only vaguely that there are controversies regarding this film, but didn't know any of the particulars aside from the fact that it was gory. Well, it's a Mel Gibson movie after all, so that's a given.In short, Apocalypto is a beautiful, deeply moving presentation of a world that existed before Western contact, and was destroyed by it. After I watched the movie, I was dismayed to read reviews that charged it with being racist, that it depicted only the blood-thirsty brutality of Mayan savagery. But this is clearly not the case. The protagonist and his people demonstrate all the virtues that allow them to wear the ""white hats:"" they are intelligent, brave, loyal, and strong. They abide in a loving community and show great care and love of family and children. They're also a good looking bunch. The ""Black Hats"" are a dirty dozen if there ever were one -- the leader of the group reminded me of the Jack Palance character in Shane, but with a lot of human bone accouterments jangling about. And if you think this guy is bad, wait till you get to the big city and see what they're up to.But I digress. I'm trying to defend the film against the charge of racism. Okay. One characteristic of racism in films in that the depiction of the targeted race tends to be one- dimensional. Apocalypto is generously peopled with characters of great individual distinction, not cut-out characters. Another characteristic is that in a racist film is that it is we are to regard the targeted race with such disdain that we are not allowed to empathize with the villains or wear the villain's skin. But in Apocalypto we are as deeply engaged in Jaguar Paw's heroic quest as we are William Wallace's in Braveheart. Some reviewers have mistaken the arrival of the Spanish galleons as Gibson's intention to signify rescue and redemption from wanton bloodletting by Western ""civilization"" and Christianity, but this is getting things upside down. Don't we know by now that Cortes' arrival was the beginning of the brutal end of so many people and civilizations in America? If the ships were to signify rescue and redemption, Jaguar Paw would only have had to have been rescued right there on the beach. Great scene for a beach-side conversion, no? No. The film presents these dark ships as the foreboding vehicles of a continent-wide apocalypse.Okay, I do concede that if Apocalypto is primarily a movie ""about"" the Mayans, it fails because it is historically inaccurate. (The Mayans were gone long before Cortes' arrival -- it was the Aztecs that he managed to destroy.) But if it is, as I interpret it to be, about the many peoples, societies, and civilizations that were destroyed, that suffered an apocalyptic end on Western contact, then it puts faces in our historical picture where there have been only caricatures before.Update of 12/27/09: I was just reading through my reviews and have to update the fact that it took me a few days after posting the original for it to strike me that the film, while not racist, was sexist as heck. The women are not shown participating in any decision-making or the production or distribution of food or anything else. Their only real value is to serve as incubators for more Mayans. I apologize to my sisters for my blindness in this but ask them to take into consideration that I came back to correct myself without prompting or threats.",Apocalypto
529,TenLineReview,"10 lines about ""Apocalypto""",6,6 January 2008,"Some of the most beautiful costumes and makeup ever committed to celluloid cannot cover up the empty shell of storytelling.A flat, soulless endeavor that left me wishing Werner Herzog had $50M to make a film.There was something unexplainable and wrong with this picture... Something that left me kept me in an unsettled mood throughout.The violence was so over the top, it became humorous by film's end.I am unsure of the historical accuracy, but the interaction between the characters felt modern and forced.The heavy handed statement on human nature and colonialism was, though entirely relevant, a pollution cloud hanging low in the jungle.Needless to say, for all of the negatives, it sure was a nonstop action packed movie with flashy fight choreography and lots and lots of swooping crane shots (for those of you who rate a movie based on that sort of thing).Some of the imagery was stunning: The set design and casting made for a wonderfully authentic atmosphere, yet the Hollywood style over-lighting that Gibson is famous for added a level of cheapness and obviousness that ripped me straight out of the jungle and onto my couch.I would rather watch ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" and be soaked in the authenticity: It was obvious that ""Apocalypto"" was trying too hard to achieve such a standard.When all is said and done, I consider this film an action movie along the lines of ""True Lies"" or any ""Bourne"" film, and I appreciated it on that level only.",Apocalypto
530,Stevie-AL,An intense journey into the mayan world.,8,15 October 2014,"This is a movie about a brutal and cruel story set in pre-Columbian Central America with a truly beautiful cinematography.It must be said that even though you might not like Mel Gibson, he shows some serious skills as a director here. It would be very unfair to judge this movie negatively because he directed it.The first half of the film feels like it stays more on a macro level showing the civilization, culture, traditions, and offering a panorama of the mayan world in general without still being clear where the story is going or who is the main character. Then in the second half, it starts to become a one man army action movie, focusing only in one character. Though it depicts a lot of violence, it doesn't feel overblown or over the top (maybe except for a few moments towards the end). Also the movie seems to be pretty accurate from a historical point of view, however that remains questionable. The storyline might not be the best, but its good enough to keep your attention during the whole movie. The language spoken in the movie is the Yucatec Maya, the cast is made of unknown Native American actors with no experience at all and yet they make a brilliant performance. These are two choices that make this film feel more raw and realistic.Costumes, make up and art direction are superb. The visual side is what makes this movie exceptional. The use of color and light is breathtaking. It captures perfectly the feeling of the savage life and it succeeds to immerse the viewer in the world it portrays.Solid 8, a very intense experience.",Apocalypto
531,Eyke87,Grade A Gibson Gore-Fest!,8,8 February 2007,"Blustering along in the wake of his other blood-soaked efforts, Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson steps behind the camera once more to bring us his take on an ancient civilization in chaos in Apocalypto.Though not suited to all tastes, Gibson effectively takes us back to a world, untouched and untamed. Shot entirely on location amongst the rainforests of Central America, it would appear, from the outside that this was nothing more an art-house movie intended for a very select audience. Without any recognisable acting talent and shot completely in the ancient Mayan dialect of the early 16th century, it feels odd to proclaim Apocalypto to be as 'Hollywood' as you could possibly get.Strip away the 'arty' gloss and your left with a straight forward, action-adventure chase movie, full of all the typical clichés you would find in Speed or Die Hard. However, unlike these staples of the genre, Gibson piles on the gore in such a sadistic manner, you are left wondering if it is, at times, gore for gore's sake.Though not without its problems, the first hour does drag somewhat, Apocalypto offers up enough thrills and spills to satisfy both the action and horror buff in equal measure. Any film with a big jaguar mauling a bad guy to death can't be bad now can it?",Apocalypto
532,shawnkenessey,It was really NOT that violent...,10,4 January 2007,"As other reviewers have noted, every negative review of this movie includes a long diatribe about how violent it supposedly is... Let me tell you, it is violent, but I honestly thought there was more shock, and more gore in the Leonard DiCaprio flick ""Blood Diamonds"".But you see, we are preconditioned by Hollywood to be at ease with gun violence, where as cutting and stabbing is seen as *MORE* violent even though being shot is far more likely to induce *DEATH*.I honestly believe that there is a faction of folks out there who want this movie to fail because it was made by Mel Gibson. They hate Mel Gibson and want to see him fail. Personally I am an adult, and I have an adult mind. I am not going to stoop to the infantile behavior of berating a persons movie because I dislike the person. The movie is one thing and the person is one thing.I guess the heart of this movie is an action flick, but there is a lot more to it than that. It's a commentary. A lot of people miss out on symbolism in movies because they're so used to being spoon fed. But there is some great symbolism in this movie. And if you care to look it is there, and it's not hidden really, its right there in front of you, but it does require you think a bit to ""get it"".The thing to realize I believe is that this is NOT supposed to be a factual movie. It is only realistic to create a place and a time. The questions of whether the people, places, and things in this movie really existed together are moot. This isn't supposed to be some kind of documentary. First and foremost it is fiction. Mel Gibson makes it clear from the outset that this isn't about the Maya per-se but that everything is a vehicle for his commentary on society. So to judge this on its supposed historical inaccuracies completely misses the point. The reality portrayed here is just a vehicle for his ideas about our own society.That being said this isn't a particularly subtle movie in a lot of ways, and that lack of subtlety works against the moments where there is a great deal of subtlety and care. Overall the action is intense and every scene seems well thought out and executed. It's just that sometimes you are so shocked by the proceedings that some of what is going on isn't being processed completely. It really is top notch film making though. I give Mel Gibson the filmmaker all the credit in the world, he truly is talented... You can nitpick this or that aspect, the fight choreography isn't amazing, but the energy and intensity of the moment is there in every way.The violence is not as bad as I thought it would be. But it's intense. You see beating hearts held aloft as men are sacrificed on the temples. You see several decapitated heads rolling down the steps of the temple. You also see a jaguar eating a mans face, which was rather strange to be sure. Aside from those moments the violence is basically like anything you would see in any other movie about violent times and violent places.Everyone bitches about this movie but I swear to you that Saving Private Ryan had a more traumatic effect on my emotions through the use of violence than this movie did. And to me this movie is about zillion times better than Saving Private Ryan. But of course every sad sack commoner cries alligator tears whenever someone mentions the horrors of WW2...This is a violent world, these are violent times, deal with it. You know what, 3,000 American soldiers were blown to bits in Iraq. How many legs and arms have been lost? How much carnage has been wrought? And some actually have the gall to take offense to this simple MOVIE? I honestly am sickened by some of the people who take no responsibility for their world, you see this place is not such a heaven, and if you could know every part of it you would know that Apocalypto is not so violent after all... The violence some of you think only exists in movies is right here with us, everyday, in our cities, and in our wars. When you put the key in the starter of that SUV men are dying around the world so that the engine can *BURN*. Oh but I'm such a liberal whiner right? Anyway, this world often goes mad and Apocalypto is here to show us, with all the gory details.",Apocalypto
533,Bullus-1,"Good rolling yarn, but no masterpiece.",7,1 January 2007,"*Spoilers*Many commentators seem to be awarding Mel Gibson major points for redeeming himself with a cinematographic tour de force; myself, I set no store by drunken rants, they are all too common these days, let's set them aside and move on. Judged on it's own merits, Apocalypto is a well-photographed jungle romp with a cast of attractive villagers, whose characters are excellently developed as Garden of Eden innocents, ripe for plundering by decadent Mayans, but once the villagers are rounded up (in a gratuitously blood-spattered raid) and marched off to the local city, we seem to get into a whole string of ancient movie clichés: The city looks like a old set from Ben-Hur, populated by hundreds of mud-caked people right off the set of Coppola's Appocalyse Now. The sacrifice scene was straight out of King Solomon's Mine to the point where even I could see the only thing that was going to save our main man was what I hoarsely whispered to my movie-mate (""Eclipse!"") and when it came up on cue she squinted at me as if I was some kind of idiot savant. His escape through the cornfield via the sacrificial death pits was a mixture of Cornel Wilde in The Naked Prey and Haing Ngor in The Killing Fields. I couldn't believe the leap off the giant waterfall a la Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, neither could the movie buffs I was relating it to later on. When he finally decides that the jungle is his manor and whacks the main pursuer with the spiked wood trap, his angry mud-caked Rambo was so perfect that I sincerely hoped that seminal actor Stallone got a royalty. The final scene was a perfect retake of Lord of the Flies, as he was kneeling on the beach awaiting his inevitable execution I almost expected the arriving Europeans to say ""Hello boys, playing Cowboys and Indians are we?"" which is what I think the naval officer said in the original version.This particular fugitive was the recipient of the most unlikely good fortune, all the way from lunar celestial intervention, topographical advantage and being in the right place at the right time for conquistadorial intrusion. A major historical sweep this was not. Rather than defining the grand theme of Mayan evolution, Mel's film focuses on a fairly minor sidebar to the unfortunately bloodthirsty aspect of their culture, the sort of detailed approach to which he appears to be somewhat limited. If there's anything really good to come out of this movie, it's the fact that newbie actor Youngblood, despite his emergent career, has managed to star in just about every motion picture show that I have ever seen.",Apocalypto
534,anticaria,"visceral, stunning, relentless ...",9,13 December 2006,"this movie does have one of the most gripping plots in movie history, and the parallels to 'titanic' are dead on (more on this a bit later). to begin with, mel's way of 'humanizing' the tribesmen is hugely successful in getting us to relate to them and become emotionally invested in their ultimate plight for survival. no one is able to do this 'humanizing' business better than mel. this level of 'humanity' and 'vulnerability' is also of course dramatically crucial as the plot unfolds and we become swept into the pageantry of the sacrificial ritual and the cast of thousands in the 'stone-built' city. i thought the epic sweep and the visual richness of the story, as well as the visceral, in-your-face way we are forced to participate in it, are a stunning revelation. not since 'the mission,' have i been so visually 'gripped' by a movie. it literally left me breathless. all critical historical inaccuracies aside, i think we must keep in mind that this is a 'work of art,' one man's vision, and as such, the poetic license mel uses in amalgamating certain elements of mesoamerican history is fully justified. after all, this is a movie, not a documentary. movies are artistic works where historical accuracy rightly takes a back seat to the director's message,' and as long as the inaccuracies do not distort the basic premise, i see no problem with it. again, this is not hailed as the 'last word' on mayan civilization; it is merely, as i said, one man's interpretation of a fictitious period piece, and as always, with mel, a work's overall message becomes paramount, as it should be. beyond that, i would have to say this movie does have the same epic, and almost biblical qualities that 'the mission' and a more recent movie such as 'titanic' both had. all involving a group of unsuspecting participants inadvertently swept into a perilous journey, without the slightest clue as to the impeding doom that lay ahead. the actors' amazing talent was another huge revelation here, and in the end, it is the superlatively nuanced acting by this group of virtual unknowns that makes this movie so gripping and moving. it is a relentless action film to be sure, but it is also an extremely touching drama, and an epic pageant for the senses, ultimately becoming one of the most powerful morality tales in modern cinema. what else can a movie audience ask for?? i could see it over and over again. oh and did i forget to mention the unbelievably realistic production values??? thank you, mr. Gibson for giving us another rare treat for the senses. it deserves to be nominated for best picture and mel deserves a nod for best director, although it will more than likely be lucky to come away with a 'best cinematography' statuette. after all, such was the ultimate fate of 'the mission,' a superlative movie which deserved the best picture award and yet only nabbed best cinematography. what a shameful place Hollywood can be when it comes to actually recognizing and rewarding truly 'superlative' work.",Apocalypto

The acting, cinematography, costumes and overall attention to detail were first rate. I did find that I had to suspend belief during the prolonged ""chase"" sequence. Jaguar Paw certainly looked fit, but outrunning an actual jaguar with a gaping hole in his side from the arrow side seemed a tad unrealistic.The ending as well was a bit unclear. We are shown the Maya at or near their decline due to famine, drought, disease, whatever. To date, the real cause for this seemingly premature demise hasn't been discovered, but we do know that it happened well before the arrival of the Spanish. I wasn't expecting to see the conquistadores rowing to shore. The Maya were still a large presence in Mexico and much of Central America at that time, but I believe their great cities were already in ruins. Perhaps I'm being a little over critical, but I would have enjoyed it more with a different conclusion.",Apocalypto
537,dctomlinson,What a piece of garbage,1,10 December 2006,"Mel Gibson has shown his incompetence again. The Mayan Empire (actually a bunch of city states much like Greece), during the Classic Period (300-900 A.D.) was considered by many to be the peak of all of the Mexican cultures. Astronomy, language, religion, culture achieved their highest potential during this time, and had declined by 900 AD and disappeared entirely by 1200 AD. The achievements of the post-Classic period, 900-1521 A.D., were a far cry from the CLassic Period; the cities were in decay and the people scattered; nothing of the city life portrayed in the movie existed in 1519, when Cortes first entered the Yucatan peninsula. By the time of Cortes' first landing on San Juan de Ulúa island near the future city of Veracruz in 1518 (no other Spaniards had landed in Mexico other than a couple of shipwrecks in 1511 or so), the Mayan city states (no where near Veracruz, where Cortes landed) had long since disappeared. And the area around Veracruz was under Aztec control, not Mayan.The temple of Kulkulcan in Chichen Itza; which was in it's height from 800-1200 A.D. somewhat resembles the temple in the movie, but the sacrifices portrayed in the movie were more characteristic of the Aztec Empire (Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City). Though Mexican influence (earlier Teotehuican and Mixtec, and later Aztec) was felt in Chichen Itza in the Classic and Post Classic Period, it is unlikely that sacrifice on the Aztec scale ever occurred on the Yucatan peninsula.THis is misleading, and at it's worst, racist. If you are looking for an action movie, look no further. But if you are looking for an accurate examination of the Mayan civilization, keep looking.To the Christian zealots who say ""This is a film about the horrors of the Mesoamerican world and how the arrival of Europeans and the Christian faith that motivated them ultimately put an end to that paganistic hell on earth."", I say that the Spaniards and the Catholic church are responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths by starvation, disease and slavery. The Church enslaved millions of American natives to dig out gold and silver to send back to the Church. They destroyed literature and religion and science in the name of Catholicism. They decimated the New Worlds and destroyed civilizations greater than anything Europe has ever produced, in the name of the Christian faith. You people underline what it is that most people understand about zealots: they lie in the name of their cause. Any sacrifice by others is worth the good they reap in the name of their faith. They are hypocrites.",Apocalypto

However, where this movie falls short is in 2 very important departments, plot and originality.I won't spoil the plot (or lack thereof) but if you've seen the trailer you've seen the first hour of the movie. After that it becomes as dull and predictable as watching paint dry. You know whats going to happen long before it does, and when it does, it looks good, but it's still not very fulfilling.The hype overstates the violence, which really isn't that graphic nor prolific and what there is fits within the story, nothing is gratuitous, neither does it do anything for the plot.To sum it up, this is a glorified chase movie, unfortunately the chase doesn't begin until over an hour in and even then you know exactly how it will end.If you enjoy cinematography then this is a treat.

There was no reason to believe he shared the religious beliefs of his captors, as he had no apparent knowledge of their practice of sacrifice.Why would the captives be killed after they were spared sacrifice? There was clearly a need for slave laborers.How is it that the captors were capable of such amazing feats of archery/spear throwing/stone throwing? At the distances depicted in the gauntlet run, they would have been lucky to injure one of the runners, and if they had been able to, it would have been closer to the beginning of the run. There is simply no way the shots depicted could have occurred in reality unless they were pure luck. How is it that Jag Paw outran the big cat as long as he did? Why would he run directly at the captors? The thing ran along like a 20 year old Labrador! How were the captors able to keep up with jag paw? Several times they seemed completely inadequate as trackers. Pausing for long periods to examine the most obvious signs. If they continued on as long as they did when he was up the tree, how is it they were able to track AT NIGHT as closely as they did? Why did their unbelievable weaponry skills abandon them at such close range in the jungle? Are they only capable at 200 yards? How did he gain such a huge lead when he came to the waterfall? How is it that he was able to pause for 20 seconds for us to enjoy such a beautiful view? And why didn't they just shoot him? How did they hear him deliver his speech standing at the top of the very tall waterfall? Do you know how loud those things are? Why didn't anyone die or get injured just from contact with the water? There aren't many Golden Gate jumpers swimming away from their leap. Why did the bees/hornets/wasps move with the camera? The ""sinkhole"" the woman was in would have had to have been a part of an underground waterway, otherwise it would always be filled with water. It didn't seem to be collecting ground water from above, otherwise there would have been torrents of water coming down. It looked like it was just collecting rainwater from directly above. if that was the case, it should have been able to drain, instead if fill up. How did Jag Paw survive lethal wounds? We never saw him drink once with that blood loss! What is with Mel's fascination with the evisceration of human beings? It's dumbfounding to make the Conquistadors the saviors. Thank heavens for Christianity Mel! Was this supposed to be realistic? Why spend so much time making this film period specific if you are going to have little girls straight out of Dune with magical abilities? What's with the timing of the eclipse and the Conquistadors? Get real! Every one of these problems could have been corrected if the director had any concept of story,time or continuity.

This movie very inaccurately portrays Mayans as killing fellow Mayans to please their Gods and then cleverly tries to create a false equivalence between these ""top of the food chain Mayans"" with the European colonizers.

Rudy Youngblood won't be unknown for long, nor will the rest of this excellent cast after proving that you don't need the big name actors to get powerful performances. This film is so engrossing that at some point you don't even realize you are reading subtitles; and as for Gibson, you'll leave the theater knowing one thing for sure about him, he sure can direct.Apocalypto's story line is easy to follow. Mayan tribal hunters are captured by warriors and one of them, Jaguar Paw (Youngblood), escapes in a desperate attempt to rescue his pregnant wife and son back in the forest where they lived. Youngblood is well cast as this young warrior whose love, strength and determination move this fast-paced film along.

I would have enjoyed more of an in-depth study of actual Mayan culture, however, that would have been a different film. This film offers its audience a glimpse into a great civilization in its final days. It allows us to ask questions about who we are and where our civilization is headed.",Apocalypto
545,bigjonnyutah,"Okay, but less than stellar",5,26 May 2007,"**This Review Contains Spoilers**It was decent. Mel Gibson's directorial visuals, are always good, however this movie falls short in almost all of the other things that make a great movie. That is not to say that everything else sucked, they were just... well okay. The acting was better than I expected, that is to say that I thought that it was believable, however no one's performance really struck me as outstanding, or even particularly noteworthy, come to think of it. Violence? yeah, there is some.. And some scenes of this movie are kind of disturbing, (i.e. the mother giving birth). But nothing that is immensely horrific, there are several scenes of heavy ""bloodletting"", But you don't really see an awful lot of the really gruesome stuff. And yes this movie is socio-culturally inaccurate... Given the current archaeological evidence of the Mayan culture and civilization. But, What movie really and truly is? If anyone is looking for any kind of historical accuracy, they should NOT be looking for it in a movie theater (unless it's an IMAX presentation). There are a few things I would have left out, such as the scene with the Europeans boating onto shore, I found absolutely no point in even giving them the 5 or 6 minutes of screen time that they did have. It was okay but I'm glad I waited for it to come out on video before I watched it. If I had seen this movie in the theater I probably would have been more disappointed with it, simply because it wasn't worth an $8.50 ticket. But as it stands as a rental it wasn't half bad. Although admittedly it isn't really something I'd rush out to the movie store and buy, either.",Apocalypto
546,Lyserod,Apocalypto vs. The Other Conquest,7,11 December 2006,"For anybody who has seen both films it's hard not to compare Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" with Salvador Carrasco's ""The Other Conquest"".From the quote sited before ""Apocalypto"" starts (you can't conquer a people from the outside unless they destroy themselves from the inside), it sounds like this film is going to be more about inner conflicts rather than outer violence, but it doesn't turn out that way.They do a good job with the beginning, setting up the equilibrium state of the lives of the Indians. We see them hunting, teasing each other, playing games, their family lives are shown and we see how they listen to story-tellers in the evening (their version of TV.) This first part of the film accomplishes the task of setting up a lot of issues that a modern audience can identify with. Especially the pushy grandmother who desperately wants a grandchild and is literally pushing her daughter and her husband together, seems like something right out of Everybody Loves Raymond.After the first plot point where another tribe stricken with fear crosses their forest, we expect this approaching danger to be the Spaniards coming to conquer the land. At this point we do care enough about the characters to follow along and worry about where it is they are being taken and why. When they reach the temple where they are supposed to be sacrificed, it feels like a bit of a let down that this is where the story was going. This doesn't seem like the great danger that was awaiting them. Even the ceremony doesn't feel that ominous as everybody is excited about watching the heads fall and the surroundings are so impressive that your eye tends to focus on that rather than the blood.Later it turns out to be more of a chase movie, in a tropical setting, incorporating all the dangers of the jungle (wild pigs, swamps, monkeys, bees, snakes, jaguars, poisonous frogs, falling tree trunks and deadly waterfalls. The longer this part of the film drags on the more frustrating it becomes for the viewer as there now seems to be less time to deal with the really important issues.Some of the gory details of the killings and sacrificing also seem to take up too much of the movie's time and focus. Of course we do expect there to be a lot of bodily harm shown explicitly when we are dealing with a Mel Gibson movie, but the way the main character keeps on surviving and fighting through this whole ordeal seems a little unbelievable. After two hours of watching all this mutilation going on you start becoming numb to it.The difference in themes between these two movies is immense. The Other Conquest deals with force, dominance, imperialism, family, morals, religion etc. ""Apocalypto"" only touches briefly on these issues and then goes on to focus on a constant race to survive, literally ""cutting to the chase"" for the rest of the film. ""Apocalypto"" deals a lot less with religion in that we only hear some short one-liners where characters pray to their God for help, and we have the tribe who sacrifices humans for the God of the sun (but the details of their religious motivations are never explained.) Other than that, the only real indication of major conflicts in religious beliefs is the final arrival of the Europeans in boats with their friars holding big crosses up, almost as if they were weapons.I would be curious to know if Mel Gibson already saw The Other Conquest and deliberately chose not to delve into the subjects that that movie deals with just because it's already been done. Or maybe he's just afraid to get into religious themes again after he got burned on ""The Passion of the Christ."" This movie surely does not take the stance that Catholicism or Christianity is better than any other religion. In fact it represents the destructive threat that these friars pose by coming to this new land. It is possible to see this movie as counter-proof to the accusations that Mel Gibson elevates his own religion and has great hatred for any people who oppose it.One of the main similarities between the two films is the focus on an Indian character and how the viewer identifies with him and cares about what happens to him and everyone he cares about. There are many close-ups of the main character in both films where there isn't a word spoken and identification is made just from expression and conveying through emotion rather than dialog. This serves to make the audience feel even closer to the character despite the inherent language barrier. We need more movies with main characters like this: Characters who represent a race that has long been discriminated against and presented as something we couldn't understand or identify with.All in all I have to say that ""Apocalypto"" could serve as a great prelude to ""The Other Conquest"". It is definitely leaving us at a point where we know a lot of serious conflicts are coming. The final lines spoken are about the Indians seeking a new beginning in the forest, but we already know, by the presence of those big ships, that this new beginning is not going to be the one they were hoping for. If ""Apocalypto"" could just generate a large audience, there would definitely be a new curiosity about what happened to these Indians' way of life after the Spaniards, with their big crosses, arrived. This is a curiosity that ""The Other Conquest"" comes in to satisfy by showing both the conflicts and the consequences of this takeover. Now all we need is a movie about the initial physical conquest of the Indians for the trilogy to be complete.",Apocalypto

There is nothing I can remember about this movie other other than the disgusting scenes where ancient Mayan people kill one another for no apparent reason.Mel Gibson should be ashamed of himself for making such a retarded movie with lots of stupid violence. Yet another example of lots of Hollywood money gone to a total waste.

Look at the viewpoint of a head falling down from the pyramid.The original Maya language for me is a plus. These people never spoke English. Why would a film falsify their native language?

549,mr-siyi-deng,"Mel is either sadistic or masochistic, but I enjoyed this movie a lot.",10,23 January 2007,"Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is atrocious. Blood drips from every frame of this movie. Repeating scenes of evisceration made me want to vomit. I'm now convinced that Mel is either sadistic or masochistic: torturing is a prevalent scheme in all his movies: from Maveric to Braveheart, to the Patriot, to the Passion of the Christ. Now the confirmation of Apocalypto.But I enjoyed this movie. A lot. Mel is good at this trade. He knows the tricks to make a movie look realistic: within all the gore and fear stood something sincere, pure, naked, you simply can't deny it. Braveheart has by far the best medieval combat scenes which could not be surpassed by any other action picture, even if CGI is so ubiquitous and omnipotent today. And again The Patriot offerers the best depiction of American revolutionary warfare. The Passion of the Christ gives us a portrait of the crucification of Jesus Christ so vivid that no one will question how much he sacrificed after watching it (I remain an ostensibly atheist, nevertheless). Apocalypto retains the prestige. No single other film has shown us such an astounding replication of the lost jungle civilization. Admittedly, there are lots of inaccuracies in the depiction of Mayans. The fact is, what other film before Apocalypto, if any, faithfully conferred the images of the indigenous people? Indiana Jones? Tomb raiders? Mel is no saint: he cares about box office, he wants to make the show more interesting. The distortion he committed is no greater than many stereotypes people do. I forgive such rendering as long as it makes a movie enjoyable.Just looking at the cast is impressive enough: none in the list sounds even remotely familiar to anybody. All are native, genuine heirs of that lost culture. And Maya is spoken in the film, which makes it almost achieve the watching experience of some National Geographic commentaries. I always dream of a film with such kind of realism about the ancient china. Many ""epic"" movies made around these days are just fantasy exotic shows, comparing to the attempt made toward realism in Mel Gibson's movies.And after all, this movie is not all about cruelty. The love of life, of one's family distinguished from all dark humanities. That's the true Apoclypto.",Apocalypto

There's like ten different camera angles on each scene and they want to use them all, even if two guys are just standing talking. Not to mention all the stop and slow motion stuff..There too much of everything. Even an action movie needs fingertip feeling. It is a film about a primitive civilization, it should have been made with a feeling that resembles the Maya people, not the latest camera technique.",Apocalypto

It stinks!,1,8 June 2007,"Dear Mel,A picture usually says more than thousand words, and unfortunately, some people believe in what they see here. So before you make another attempt to display a part of ""Human History"", Please get your facts straight. This movie is a slap in the face for every half way educated Person in regards to Physics, Astronomy, Human Physiology, Mayan and Aztec Culture and History. I have been waiting for the DVD just to see the elaboration and comments in the special features; the how-to's and perhaps some Information about the idea and birth of this very typical Hollywood making. Well, instead of searching for a fitting jungle to make this movie, you should have searched in Libraries about the real history and time lines, a lunar eclipse in 3 minutes? The Spanish show up at the end of the movie? Please! Not to mention that our hero is bleeding for 2 days and still manages to out-pace and eliminate the bad guys - cute, but unreal. It's wrong, it's all wrong and there is no excuse for not making your homework if you attempt to capture history in some made up reality.In the end it is just another piece made in Hollywood, so people should not expect of anything being accurate or close to the truth, again, unfortunately. And since I never took Hollywood seriously by any account, it doesn't really matter. So what's new on the mountain?Sorry Mel, next time spend more funds on research and there might be a good chance to get a few things right.

Does that make any sense? Is she the daughter of a god, or what? Excessively Savage Mayans that may as well have been like that, why not? But then again, who says they were like that? Let's talk with a real Mayan about that. I've done, BTW, some Mayan research and never read something' about the blood thirst and cruelty.Then, besides all the mistakes, the way the movie develops is just really really boring.

Many hate reviews had a point to it and movie is excessively bloody. True, but the way I see it, Mel Gibson is trying to show us how he feels about media ganging up on him. I guess it is very, very difficult to be the target of major discreditation campaign. Movie has none existing storyline. True, question is whether or not you are going to like that. I liked it a lot. Movie keeps you on the edge of a seat by other means. Movie is not a documentary about Maya kingdom, true, and it is not pretending to be one. Spaniards at the end of the movie is totally out of place, true, and I can say that this is one thing that I did not like about the movie.

Sensual. Entertaining. Massive. Gut-wrenching. Suspenseful. Mystical. Frightening. Intricately detailed. Ingeniously written and directed. Brilliant. Exotic. Lush.This film knocked my socks off - a well-told, coming of age story about supporting family and community. We watched the DVD at home on our 37"" screen television, and still the picture was beautifully pristine - the panoramas, jungles, waterfall, city sets, costumes and makeup brought us right into the action. Normally I avoid movies that smear the screen with blood and gore. Not this time. It was essential for realism. We're going to look for this in the movie theater. It's so detail oriented I'd enjoy a re-viewing on the big screen.I can't imagine all the actors spoke Mayan as their native language, and probably most spoke some dialect of Spanish. I don't know how Mel Gibson learned enough Spanish to direct the native actors. Perhaps good storytelling is universal. He certainly succeeded. I never once wondered where the camera was or how a particular shot was captured, e.g., the jaguar.I particularly enjoyed the mystical aspects. We all have an inner voice. Had our hero listened to that inner voice perhaps his family and villagers could have avoided their plight.My husband NEVER, ever watches a movie with subtitles, but he didn't protest and never left the room once the film began. We both agree the Mayan language brought authenticity to the story.APOCALYPTO is intense, once seen it's hard to get out of your system.

The film follows the tale of a young hunter, Jaguar Paw, who is taken as prisoner after his village gets viciously attacked by a Mayan army. Paw is led back to the Mayan city to be sacrificed to the gods but manages to escape and flees back to his village where his pregnant wife and son await. When you get through the first hour of extreme violence and suffering set on a couple of truly breathtaking locations you will find the movie has ultimately been setting itself up for an outrageously thrilling chase scene that will leave viewers in awe. Once the chase gets going Apocalypto does not stop to breathe. The pace is second to none and Gibson shows of his directing prowess.It is best not to look for concealed depths or hidden messages and ignore any historical inaccuracies and see Apocalypto as simply great cinema.VerdictA strong action-adventure story packed with blood, guts and gore along the way makes Apocalypto worth the watch, even if only the once.

I spent money expecting to be entertained, not disturbed. There is no higher meaning in this movie except survival. It's like watching ""The running man"" with endless purposeless bloody chasing.Mel doesn't have any imagination in directing, he just basically dumped all the disgusting scenes in front of you so you'll feel disturbed.

Gibson was born to make Apocalypto. A cinematic feast with a simple storyline, lots of visuals and drama set in the mysterious and ancient Mayan civilization. Here Mayan culture and history are seared like a charred patty. For Gibson, all the veggies & condiments have already been served by National Geographic. Visually detailed, shocking and brutal sacrificial rituals are depicted and the term 'heads will roll' soars to new heights in Apocalypto. Dive deep into Gibson's REM stage slumber and you might envision his recurring nightmare of finding true Mayan names other than 'Jaguar Paw' and 'Turtles Run'. As with The Passion of the Christ and Braveheart, Gibson is once again blessed upon with a group of really exceptional crew and super talented actors.

I think there are laws against this. What I hate is the graphic details of the violence some of which I thought unnecessary and could have been edited to cut the length of the movie.I am most disappointed to recently learn that the empire in the movie committing mass human sacrifices were not the Aztecs which would have been more accurate but the Mayans. historical misrepresentation of Mayans.

Spaniards land.--and that's about it, except for the subplot with Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife and child, which goes like this: they're in a hole. They get out at the end.Seriously, I did not find enough story in this movie to fill 90 minutes, much less the 2 hours plus that it consumes. People who complain about how violent it is are probably doing so because of how long and drawn out the bloodletting scenes are. I've seen worse gore, but the scene of human sacrifice takes up ten minutes, where all we learn is, a human sacrifice is taking place. Seeing someone cut their finger would be off-putting if I had to stare at it for that long.That scene, and all the ones leading up to it, are so predictable that they could be compressed into ten or fifteen minutes total to get to the start of the story. The real story starts when Jaguar Paw is given a ""Most Dangerous Game"" chance at survival, but even then, there aren't really any plot twists. He gradually whittles down his pursuers as they chase him through his home forest. But even at this point, there are only so many frames I want to watch of the hero running away through trees and rivers.Someone (can't remember who) once said that action isn't just motion, but it seems that Mr. Gibson and Mr. Safinia don't understand that.

563,jozzev,The most disgusting movie I have ever seen,1,20 January 2007,"Apocalypto is the most disgusting movie that I have ever seen... It is racist to the bone and an absolute disgrace.I had been looking forward to this one ever since I heard a movie about the Ancient Maya was being made, and in their own language! What a missed opportunity! It's in Maya, but the WRONG Maya language! The language they speak in the movie is Yucatec Maya, which was not spoken in the region the movie is situated! (ehhm, mountains and near the sea??? Where the hell would that be in the Maya world?!?) But considering it was about a big city-state in the mountains and considering the style of the temples/buildings it much be the Palenque area. - were Yucatec Maya was never spoken...Mel Gibson is a total racist by making the film the way he did. He portrays them as blood-thirsty primitives, waiting for the Europeans to make their lives better. Those Europeans do arrive at the end of the movie, (I assume they represent the Spanish even though they look Anglo-Saxian), only they arrive 600 years too early!Furthermore, there is a sun eclipse which totally surprizes and therefore amazes the Maya priests - despite the fact that the Maya are known for their accuracy in terms of astronomy... they possessed a knowledge much beyond the level of Europe at that time (900 AD).This movie is pure speculation, based on nothing, and when it does pretend to be historically correct Gibson confuses practices of the Maya with those of the Mixtec and Aztec (captives, sacrifices, etc).I really wonder what this movie contributes...apart from further separation between people(s) and cultures. What a missed opportunity...",Apocalypto
564,TheZapRowsdower,And now for something completely different.,8,8 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's conduct as of late has been questionable to say the least. What with his drink-induced Anti-Semitic rant to his pledge to support Jewish actor Michael Richards, who had just finished an angry racial tirade (although Mel Gibson should be given credit for trying). We live in a world where everybody gets so angry. The Passion of the Christ opened to hostility because it was mistakenly taken for Anti-Semitism. This was about as absurd as German people getting riled up over Schindler's List, but I digress. Many people are still angry with Mel Gibson over his supporting an alleged racist, over his drunken Anti-Semitic remarks, some are still angry over his depiction of the Jews in the Passion. We all need to get over it. We need to forgive and forget, because our anger is affecting our opinions on his work.Imagine a world where the Pianist was never given a chance, because Roman Polanski is a fugitive from the United States, under statutory rape charges. Imagine a world where nobody watches Falling Down, because Joel Schumacher destroyed the Batman franchise. Is it really in our best interest to hold a grudge? Especially in Mel Gibson's case, which was something so incredibly trivial? Doesn't Apocalypto deserve a fair shot? Doesn't it deserve reviews that are better than ""mixed""? Well, yes.Apocalypto is unlike anything we had seen before. It's not just the fact that Mel Gibson filmed it in a dead tongue (which had been done before, BY Mel Gibson), but the fact that it explored a civilization that Hollywood hasn't taken the time to explore. It went into the life of a Mayan, and it threw him into what was basically the beginning of the end of their civilization.Jaguar Paw, a Mayan father played brilliantly by Rudy Youngblood, is taken away from his family to be sacrificed. He escapes a brutal sacrifice and begins his journey home - all the while being chased by his captors. We're talking one big, long chase scene. And it's awesome, to say the least. Don't want to give too much away, but there's plenty of bloodshed and a high body count.To perform in Maya must have been a difficult task for performers who were not Mayan. But they pulled it off, and they did it very well.Don't mean to use a stereotype, but the visuals are breathtaking. This is the best cinematography I have seen all year. The scenery was amazing, and the costumes and make-up were great. Mel Gibson has been compared to Cecil B. DeMille (in a negative context for some odd reason). DeMille has NEVER done anything like this before. I can see a few things, here and there, including a large cast and epic scenery, but this is a much different endeavor than, say, the Ten Commandments. In fact, this wasn't a religious film at all (and I've seen it referred to as such). This is more in the vein of Braveheart than the Passion.I'm hoping to see Apocalypto get its due at the Oscars this year. I can at the very least see one for Cinematography. I'd put it up for Best Picture... maybe not the win, but definitely a nomination. While I felt this was Mel Gibson's weakest film, I DID hold his other films in very high regard. The story wasn't all that deep, but Mel Gibson had a Hell of a way of telling it. I enthusiastically recommend this film. This is a definite must-see.",Apocalypto
565,shifty1032231,To A New Beginning,7,2 December 2006,"I've recently watched a free preview of Apocalypto at my college CU Boulder and the place was packed to see if Mel Gibson can top or sink after the Passion of the Christ. First off if your not considering to watch this movie after what Mel said when he got arrested will not do justice to this very well made film. The film is packed with chases, blood, gore, fluid camera movements, and pulsing music. The film is not perfect but satisfies the taste for great entertainment when most of our films now bore us with unoriginal clichés and ridiculous plot lines. This film is original and takes a sincere look at the Myan culture without reducing it to its primitive nature. Yes the sacrifices and violence could be stereotypical of all native cultures before the Europeans came in some eyes but the film has sincere moments at the village with the people interacting. Its when the village is raided and the villagers are captured as slaves when everything changes. The film revolves around a native hunter named Jaguar Paw who is at peace with his village. His wife is far along pregnant with a new son and the world is looking up for the village. The village, as I previously said, is raided. He becomes a slave after being caught but his wife and son are hidden away. The rest of the film revolves his journey back to them. The costumes, music, and art direction for the settings are stunning and worth the money. Mel Gibson uses the chase element to its max with the ferocity of the battle scenes in Braveheart. You will not be bored. The film has some unbelievable and cliché moments which serves the hero purpose back. The acting however is done well with the mostly newcomer Myan speaking in the native tongue. Have fun with the film, I did but I expected more to be shown of the culture than just a chase and blood gushing thrill ride. 7 out of 10",Apocalypto

The movie makes you stop and think and wonder about the ""lost civilizations."" This movie will surely run you through a plethora of emotions including anger, sadness, and joy. The cinematography is brilliant as well as the set design. All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie to someone interested in the lost civilizations and culture in general. The ending of the movie (not going to give that away) is definitely fitting. This movie is beautiful and, thank Heavens, did not include the typical Gibson-esquire plot line of an underlying love story but rather of honor.",Apocalypto
567,fredo70,The Greatest Mesoamerican Film Ever Made,9,10 January 2007,"It is a rare experience to visit the cinema and see something different. Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is a unique cinematic experience, taking a classic storyline and retelling it using a different culture, time, language and peoples.Gibson and Safina take great care during the opening sequences to set up the main characters, so that the audience empathises with them and can later root for them. The behaviour within the tribe at the beginning is recognisable to audiences from any culture focusing on horseplay, practical jokes and family tensions.Compared to other movies like ""The New World"" these Native Americans are not stereotypical noble new age savages, hippies prancing about worshipping trees, each cast member has their own discernible personality. The relationships within this group are believable and you grow to genuinely like the group. This is the reason why the film works.The casting is superb, how did Mel assemble so many fantastic faces. Again, physically each actor suited their part perfectly from the mean and sadistic guard through to the High Priest, looked like they had stepped off the pages of a Lost Civilisation book.There has been a lot of attention on the violence in this film. Most of the violence is inferred, off camera. There are depictions of wounds but this is showing the consequences of violence. However it is the use of sound that makes the audience wince, the cracking of bones and the sound of ripping skin was uncomfortable.The action scenes a deftly handled, building up a kinetic pace. The final act of the film is one long chase scene, which far from getting boring gets more exciting as the film progresses. This is like Rambo or Tarzan on steroids as the hero cunningly dispatches his pursuers using the law of the jungle.Apocalypto is unlike anything produced by an American studio. It is pure cinema, with sparse dialogue, and only sound,music and visuals driving the story. One can only hope that, Hollywood can take this film as an example, of what can be achieved on a low budget, with no stars, with an excellent concept and make more diverse movies, rather than the remakes, sequels or cookie cutter nonsense that you find at your local Odeon.",Apocalypto
568,bbone,Mel Gibson at it's best!,10,13 December 2007,"In a deep jungle is unfolding the deep civilization clash, as Aztecs brutally enslave the jungle Maya people. This movie dramatize the clash of civilizations as clash of good and evil in it's pure forms. The idea behind the scene is to show how absolute power corrupt absolutely. The ritual killings are just the pompous demonstration of power of the Aztec rulers. The movie Apocalypto dramatically show how much must many and many people suffer for the enjoyment of just a few. And it is not just a people, who suffer. Even the nature pay dearly for the never ending hunger for power of a few.One cannot help to see how this is still valid today, as the ritual killings and whips of guards are exchanged for money and police. In both cases we clearly witness the pompous demonstration of both money and police power everywhere. Yet the basic principle of civilization decline and end remain the same. We live only until we face greater evil, as was the cause of Aztec. They are about to get wiped out of the face of Earth by other, even greater monsters.Mel Gibson once again prove that he can make a excellent movie. Rudy Youngblood in the title role is excellent and his co-actors keep up with him as well. They make Hollywood look kinda lame :)",Apocalypto

Gibson's ability to mentally and visually stimulate an audience is ever present in this epic. Taking unknown people and molding them into the emotional characters they portrayed must have seemed an impossible task...but it worked! The acting was unbelievably realistic...the scenery was breathtaking...the pain and desperation was felt...the sub-titles were brief, descriptive and easy to follow. It was painful to see a culture dying from within. It should make all of us stop and remember where we've been and wonder where we're going.

The movie,I believe, was intended to surprise the viewers in the second half by disclosing the main plot. However, many viewers may leave their seats in sheer impatience. However, for those viewers, who glue themselves to their seats, and continue watching the movie - it won't disappoint you! Jaguar's escape is presented quite impressively, and for those who are content with such a short plot, this movie is great! Actually, I had expected much more from the Director Mel Gibson - a brilliant actor. If he had started building the character from the first half, audience would have got a chance to understand and enjoy the character more because honestly, I was under the delusion that Jaguar's father was the main character until he died!",Apocalypto

In Australia we have a foreign language free to air TV channel that shows lots of movies with subtitles - why doesn't the US produce more of these? They force you to focus on the visual and the mood, and it's here that another Aussie (Dean Semmler) excels. A beautifully shot movie but one with the standard Hollywood predictability of plot in places. A small price to pay for something quite different to the usual fare. And these 'natives' make most boring middle of the road $15m actors (think Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Julie Roberts etc etc) look nothing more than ham. Yes, the violent scenes are violent but those were savage tribal days of conquest. Let's face it, Passion of the Christ was a snuff movie. Apocalypto is great.

If a parent/teacher would take the time to preview the show and explain to their charge what they're about to witness, it would be a valuable experience for the youngster(s). Hey, crazy things happen every day in the real world, right? I would argue that the violence and nudity are absolutely crucial to accurately convey the authenticity of the period. Naturally, much in the way of costumes, makeup, etc. had to be created from archaeological examples. I believe this movie is edutainment in the purest sense: A fictional tale, which relates the utter brutality, beauty and social grace that were the Mayan people. The sets, costumes and camera work really shined through, especially in the cityscape scenes. I can't remember more vivid imagery!Mel Gibson took full advantage of an opportunity to bring this culture in the spotlight.

575,metatronica,Thank god for white people?,2,9 December 2006,"It's has if the Native Americans haven't suffered enough.Before I rip on this film, I'll make one apology. I thought the movie was about Aztecs (since they're the ones famous for sacrifices and warfare), but it's actually about Mayans. I didn't read any reviews or previews for this movie that stated so. Actually, one of the main events in the movie that threw me off was the lack of astronomical awareness. Mayans could predict eclipses.Aside from all that was anthropologically appalling, Apocalypto was a formulaic piece of crap. I had the entire plot planned out in my head by the first quarter of the movie. A man is wronged and his family put in danger. He goes and seeks revenge and in the end shows the world what he's made of. How many other movies follow that plot? Too many to count. Not to mention that all the characters were horribly two dimensional: the terrible and evil people vs. the happy people living in their happy village. I hate movies that has to obviously lay out whose side you're supposed to be on. It's as if the audience is too stupid to have a mind of their own.What killed me the most was the ending, which I guessed after reading the quote that appeared at the very beginning of the movie. Yes, let's look at these horribly savage people, brainless religious fanatics, hurt each other and live in such ""uncivilised"" and disturbing ways. Yes, let's ignore the Mayan's unique writing system and their innovations in math and astronomy. Instead, let us focus on just how terrible they really were.

576,r1msky,Incredible,10,19 October 2015,"This is one of the most amazing movies i ever watched. Mel Gibson managed to create a complete world in front of a camera. Time flew so fast watching it, i was upset when it ended. I am not sure about historical reliability and a lowdown of the film but everything was pretty much believable. The quality of filming, scenes, decorations, stage designs was awesome. The plot is really fascinating and breathtaking. One can feel that misery, anguish, anger and even shame of losing home and relatives. I was especially shocked during the scene when assailants take away the wife of a strapped native man for raping. He was unable to help her...damn i was so livid but lost at the same time. That was strong.Generally, the whole movie is full of very tough, emotional scenes, and i am telling you - this is a virtue. It leaves a message. Personally i realized how grateful we should be for what we have around us, i mean, civilization, basic human rights and safety. Yeah, after the film one will be assured that safety is above all!All emotional background is based around chasing. Chasing from primal fear, cruelty, horrible death. One can practically experience all of it watching Apocalypto. That's really something.So overall, if you're looking for a nice movie to have a family weekend that's hardly the best option. But i bet no one searching for a serious insightful cinema art will be disappointed.",Apocalypto
577,jius,An interesting idea but rather a little disappointing,5,16 January 2007,"An interesting film in that it is trying to go against the Hollywood grain, but the films downfall is the way in which it tries to be different. The film is a typical Mel Gibson film in that the core ""doctrine"" of the film is never accurate, even going back to Braveheart this is very evident in his films.In this film Gibson would have us believe that the Maya empire is collapsing and their crops are failing all as the Spanish are about to arrive. It's a shame that the Maya Empire collapsed in the 8th - 9th Century. So perhaps it is the fall of the Aztec empire then in the film...but then shouldn't they be speaking in Nahuatl? Rather confusing as to what is going on.This aside using Maya as the language was a good way to give the film a cultural flavour, but again its rather funny that despite there still being many Mayan language variations the different tribes could communicate with ease. I would have been nice if he had used real Maya people as the actors speaking Maya for real. It was funny to hear hits of US and Native American accents in the obvious non-speakers Maya. Perhaps the acting talent is not quite there in Mayan communities, but Gibson at least could have used Mexican main actors that would have looked more believable as Mayan's than using State-side actors.I guess if you take out all the Mel Gibson hype and some of the gore and action...this would have been one foreign language film that would have failed a lot less at the cinema. But a good indicator of a film's success is to go a few days later than its premier and see how many people are still going. I did and found the cinema about 1/12th full...if that, and with an average age of 40.Overall it was an interesting film...but you do feel a little disappointed after watching it and feels like it lacked just that little bit extra depth to it. But if you want to see a Pre-Hispanic Rambo jumping off cliffs and attacking his predators...then you will enjoy the final 1/2 hour or so.",Apocalypto

It was so outstandingly energizing that i can remember what i was wearing, the color of the sky and my family's attitude! Rarely can one say this about a movie.During the whole movie i was on the edge of my seat, my heart was pounding an i was sucked into the story. Nothing could distract me unless there was a fire! I can honestly say that i prefer this movie to having a one night relationship with a beautiful women.The actors were incredibly outstandingly godly! The decoration was incredible, the make up wowazyzing, the story was super insane! Everything was perfect!

579,Ce_Aqatl,Staggeringly humane,9,1 January 2007,"The critics' blindness and inability to give Gibson's films a fair judgment, continues to stupefy me. Although Apocalypto is replete with violent and disturbing scenes, the (admittedly excessive) blood and gore serves but one purpose - to highlight the cruelty and bloodlust that were the true cornerstone of most pre-Columbian civilizations. The New World is portrayed as a place where human life is valued only as a meal for bloodthirsty gods and where even truly noble and daring men, such as Jaguar Paw, have to literally cleave through their enemies to survive and protect their beloved ones. Of course, this vision of XVIth century Yucatán is extremely politically incorrect, and I wonder why Gibson hasn't already been sued by some 'Maya Pride' organization. Regardless, the film's message is that of a passionate humanism, a cry for change in a world where humans hunt humans. The arrival of Spaniards late in the movie symbolizes this change - which also meant the end of the world as Maya knew it. The behavior of conquistadores in Mexico was far from Christian (insert humane if you like) - but the sheer amount of cruelty in native society deprives it of all saving grace.",Apocalypto

This movie served to prove to my mind that Mel Gibson is ""Going Slightly Mad"" as Freddie Mercury coined.The story essentially is pretty weak and the whole movie is OTT with violence, I've never really been bothered with violence in a movie either way it rarely influenced my taste. This however is FAR too much with no need for half of it. The final straw was when Jaguars Paw's wife had the baby underwater, fair dues to the woman for it im sure but i find it quite hard to believe she balanced on a rock pushed out a baby while holding her eldest and being honest she barley flinched.The end of the movie was also completely unnecessary and served to sully the movie, Cortez had NO baring on the the movie but just for pure cheese sake he was included at the end.

Lifes of ordinary people are changed everyday. We might not be holding sacrifices anymore, but killing is still going on and on, in the name of freedom, peace and love!

It's not nearly as graphic as I thought it would be. At the same time, this is a brutal film.After watching the film, I'm not completely sure what Gibson is trying to say, but I'm sure of one thing, Gibson is definitely passionate and is definitely trying to express something, which is far more than I can say for almost any other directors in Hollywood at the moment.

Allow me to make it clear. First of all the trailer, title and every pre-comment of the movie was telling us that the movie is about the end of a civilization. I haven't seen anything like this in the movie. There was that one tribe attacks another and they make human sacrifices. So we're watching like half an hour at the beginning as they are captured, another half an hour while they are taken to the other tribe, then a another half an hour expecting for some kind of miracle to happen, and the last hour of running in the jungle. Second thing, if someone goes to watch the movie, who hasn't got the proper knowledge of American history, how should one know which civilization are we talking about in the movie? And then at the end Columbus or who comes on the shores and that's all, but what does this have to do whit the destruction of a civilization?

588,ruthie-30,History's first ever water-birth?,10,14 February 2010,"After reading the reviews on here, and in the TV listings, I was expecting far worse blood guts and gore than there was. As has been said, this is not nearly as gratuitous and sickening as some of those torture porn movies that I can't bear to watch. All the violence in this film was necessarily part of the story and the culture of the time, and anything more sanitised would have been like those old westerns where people fell down dead after being shot and not a drop of blood marred their pristine white suits.I thought Apocalypto was a splendid movie, and a very daring subject for Mel Gibson to tackle. Historical inaccuracies - as I am a Philistine when it comes to history, I had no idea of any mistakes made so they bothered me not at all. Anyway it was a piece of fiction, and showed one man's ability to triumph against all the odds.Of course Jaguar Paw was depicted as superhuman in his strength, endurance and sheer physical abilities, but as a soft hearted woman I feel sure that his powerful desire to be reunited with his wife and child who he had left down the waterless well, carried him onwards. When he jumped down that waterfall, the fact that his pursuers did the same, and some survived, lent credence to that amazing feat.The chase scenes were amazing although they did drag on a little, I found, but then again I have never been a fan of car chases or any kind of chases in movies. Re goofs; I did notice that the man who had his face bitten off by the Jaguar did seem to make a remarkable post mortem recovery, or maybe the undertakers had already been around to make him look half decent for his loved ones? The scene where Jaguar Paw's wife gave birth in the water filled hole has been derided on here, but for me, working in the field of childbirth education and support, it made me smile. Was this history's first ever instance of a fully fledged water-birth? Did Jaguar Paw's missus find the pain relief such that she recommended it to her friends afterwards (whatever friends were still alive after the carnage of the movie, anyway) thus setting in motion the trend that was to become the modern day birthing pool? I wonder if Mel Gibson has witnessed his wife giving birth in a pool and this gave him the idea?",Apocalypto

The violence is at all times necessary, not gratuitous, in telling this story of a civilization that has become famous for it's violent and decadent customs with the mass graves that have been unearthed in very recent years down in Mexico.

In spite of negative comments by friends & family, I thought the visuals would be worth the time & money. Well, maybe they are, if you're not too picky. It was a stunning-looking movie- for awhile. The plot - One Heroic Common Man Battles To Save His Family - was predictable, a Mel Gibson standard. The effects wore thin pretty quickly, I thought, through repetition. They could have called it ""Run Through the Jungle"". And were the bad guys supposed to be Mayans, or Aztecs? I've seen references to both in the studio flak, and the details of the sets and costuming mostly might have been either, though none too accurately portrayed for either. If I were Indian, I'd be po'd - there really is no generic before-Cortez Indian civilization. In fact, the research generally was poor. The Mayans and Aztecs knew how to predict eclipses for hundreds of years before the Spaniards arrived, but the plot-hinging eclipse seemed to have been a surprise. And poison frogs are smaller than a thumbnail and the poison requires preparation- you can't just jab a thorn into a frog and poke an enemy and watch him keel over.

However, Jaguar manages, before being also caught, to safe his pregnant wife and son in a deep hollow. Knowing that his family relies on him he has to face a race against time and other undesired encounters... Apocalypto and Mel Gibson have been heavily criticised since the film has been released. Maya-experts found mistakes reinforcing false clichés of the habits and customs of the ancient Mayas and Aztecs. For instance, the language that is spoken throughout the film is supposedly not quite the right. On the other hand, Mel Gibson evoked great furore remarking anti-Semitic comments that even led to boycotts in the USA. Though Mel Gibson's attitudes may be controversial he is definitely a gifted director who knows how to make a film. The atmosphere he creates seems so real through the use of the above mentioned ancient language and the extraordinary actors, only to give you a few examples.It makes you believe you are in the jungle from the very beginning.

This movie will teach you nothing new of Indian culture. What is even worse is that it strengthens Indian stereotypes (throwing Mayans, Aztecs etc all on 1 big pile of Indian).

Theme music can keep me pondering what the movies is saying. 2) lack of impressive fighting scene, may be too focused on natural. 3) there are some controversial issues of racism and misrepresentation of Mayan civilizationThis is kind of movie I like to watch more than once.",Apocalypto
598,Gonzo_Knight,An exercise in unrestrained hatred.,2,30 September 2010,"Some of the reviews that this ""work"" has been getting are a proof positive that by and large viewers, even those who seem passionate about what they are writing about are often unable to properly critique. What's missing is similar to what the people behind Apocalypto are missing - an understanding that an opinion without any real point of reference is becomes nothing but a vector without direction. It's got a magnitude but it's brainless.A lot of things make Apocalypto as wretched as it. Not only did it make me angry (I'll get to that in a moment) but it was embarrassingly poorly directed and written. The action sequences were shallow and predictable. The staging was as simple and pedestrian as can be and it's very sad that so many people are blind to this fact simply due to superior make-up. That'sthe only aspect of the production I can praise by itself but even there I didn't feel that it worked very well with the rest of the production.All of this can easily be forgiven and overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that all of this scenes were made for one purpose only: to manipulate the audience in feeling a certain way. and I wasn't having any of it. take for example the sequence with the pregnant woman falling in to a hole - it was tasteless and shallow.As a director Gibson has become incredibly one-note, constantly exploiting the same emotions of anger at seeing the honorable ""heroes"" being brutally assaulted and punished. Think about his filmography for a second. His own sense of taste.It's not just that Gibson makes movies for himself (almost all directors do that in one way or another), it's just that what he wants out of these movies is sick and appalling. His own range of fetishes is incredibly narrow and dare I say, based on every thing I've seen from him over the years reflects his own deeply rotten character.Remember the opening words in the beginning of the movie about how great civilizations end? Absolutely nothing in Apocalypto lived to those words and made any sort of a great point. Unlike other violent but ultimately important and enlightening war films Apocalypto is nothing but an exercise in cruelty and savagery.",Apocalypto

The acting, costumes, cinematography, make-up, direction, scenic beauty . . . the list goes on and on. It's one of those very rare cinematic experiences that comes around once every decade or so. This is the type of epic masterpiece that is best seen on the big screen. After I walked out of the film, I literally felt that I was still in the primitive world of the characters. The picture is very, very intense and realistic, and although it's violent, the violence is not exploitative. After a few days of thought I decided that it was even better than ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Braveheart,"" which are two masterpieces in their own right.",Apocalypto
600,manchez@sbcglobal.net,Survival can be thrilling in the Mayan jungle,9,14 December 2006,"I have never been a fan of Die Hard series because there are so many other movies where the hero avoids death to reach the end. With Mel Gibson at the helm, this project becomes another Die Hard in the Jungle, but set half a millennium ago in the Mayan jungle, full of magic and natural beauty. My favorite scene was when Jaguar Paw walks through the mud pit, black as the she jaguar of the earlier scene; as if transformed into a different being that is now invincible, baptized by the need to survive at all costs and to reach his overrun village. Still hoping to find his pregnant wife and son alive. So what if an eclipse happens in the same time-frame of a full moon(Mel couldn't resist the Director's Temptation of illuminating a dark sky with a moon when many stars would have given us a more accurate impression of the Maya's understanding and fascination with the constellations) or the rainwater fills the cenote with crystal clear water(not so easy to film underwater in muddy run-off). Certainly two arrows miss vital organs in his body to keep the movie from ending before its Hollywood conclusion. I hope more directors can give us a glimpse into the rest of the world without needing white heads to attract our interest. If the statement that other people have lived and continue to live interesting lives that can be made into exciting screenplays is the only worthy reason for Mel Gibson's enterprise, then it was worth the effort. The exposure to such a great number of new actors is whipped topping on a greatly entertaining movie that does not claim to be a historical piece. I could tell that Mel Gibson can train any actor to look directly at a camera, however pointless it may be. Don't wait for it on DVD, unless you own a movie theater with superb sound system.",Apocalypto

All native American actors in most of the film.I won't write much about the movie though I will say that it takes you somewhere else, to an ancient mindset. An odd and sometimes strange yet wonderful mindset of an ancient culture.There are characters that we can love, have concern for, see importance of family and of community and even humor. Also they hunt, they kill animals and live off the land.There are heartbreaking scenes and others that are truly inspiring.It seems that intelligent cultures have the tendency to control or dominate other cultures that are less advanced. This is present in this film.I would call Mel a mad genius. There is often a borderline between high intelligence and madness.A movie has not moved me as much as this film, in a long time.",Apocalypto

A compelling enough story, some dutiful acting by a cast of unknowns, and some gorgeous scenery; all of which is overtaken by some of the most graphic gore I've seen in a mainstream film. The violence, quite frankly, detracts from the film after a while. It's a case of: ""Enough already!"" There's a chase scene that runs, easily, three or four times as long as needed. Methinks this film tries a bit too hard to be controversial. Not Mr. Gibson's best effort.",Apocalypto
603,el_diablo_03,WooW!!! Everyone must see this!!,10,15 January 2007,"How wonderful is this piece of art!! People who appreciate cinematography and film making would consider this movie a piece of art... Calling it just a movie would degrade its value and beauty and would be comparable to the other cheap movies Hollywood make for money... Luckily enough, this piece of art is not one of those cheap movies and I guarantee you this: This movie is awesome!! To create an ancient civilization you always need to set back and define the elements that need to exist in the environment surrounding the culture Once all the elements are ready you begin bringing them into the screen by a storytelling mechanism From this point of view, Apocalypto has what it takes from showing everything that the 'Maya' culture was known of and how they used to make their living on. However, the movie doesn't concentrate on that alone. It is centric around one character in particular (i.e. Jaguar Paw) and how he tries his best to survive the brutal incidents that happened on his people.I don't know really if those killings and brutality that I saw in the movie is what the 'Maya' people used to do before their civilization was ended long time ago. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they really happened and at the same time I don't care!!! I don't know why people judge this movie by saying the 'Maya' civilization didn't have that much violence Who cares? The movie is great and I think that is more than enough and whether this brutality actually occurred or not is really disturbing the greatness of this movie so I say this: Look into this movie from an artistic eye and forget what people say about its morality because once you do that, you are going to enjoy it as much as I did.Mel Gibson really did a great job on this one The direction couldn't be more beautiful It really shows you what you need to see and nothing else The evolvement of the characters as they grow more hatred and vengeance towards each other can be a hard thing to show and point out. However, congratulations on this one Mel, you really did it!! I couldn't see anything more beautiful than the hatred that Jaguar Paw grew inside him, and little by little this hatred appears on the screen.The Last word: If you still didn't see this, then what are you waiting for? For the movie to be released on a DVD? Then I say no buddy, this is one of those movies that you must see on the big screen. If you like brutal movies and enjoy the killings, then this is definitely for you If you like to see a beautiful direction and cinematography with a simple story that describes everything, then you got it there: Apocalypto is the right choice!! I give this movie a 10/10 and goes to my top five movies for 2006.",Apocalypto

The use of real production elements vs. CGI really helps this film attain a level of authenticity that is becoming more and more rare in big budget films.Nonetheless, the film suffers from an overly simplistic story that cannot be engaging despite the gobs of violence and action that attempt to keep us involved (or disgusted).The fall of the Mayas is certainly an interesting, rarely dealt with cinematic topic, but Mel seems more interested in documenting the horrific violence of the culture than anything else. Why couldn't we have seen more of the city? Or the religious practices?

It's like he invented a time machine, went back to the days Mayan civilization and dropped off a handful of cameras. The entire movie is so engulfing and mesmerizing due to this ""lack of camera crew"", that you find yourself disgusted, appalled and intrigued for the entire duration. Can a civilization as advanced and cultural as the Mayan be SO cruel and savage? Be that the case or not, Mel Gibsons directing surely keeps your attention - on the big screen instead of pondering over such matters.It's not my most favorite film and have only watched it a couple of times (due to the above reasons), but it's certainly worth seeing.",Apocalypto

I was so engaged in this movie that the two hours this movie played for simply flew by. There were so many things that I liked about it. The pacing was simply perfect. There was never a point where this film dragged, and there was not a scene in this film that you could afford to miss. Also the acting was phenomenal. Great character development throughout the entire movie, which highlighted a surplus of memorable characters. On top of everything it had fantastic cinematography and production design, that captured the world it was trying to recreate. Overwhelmingly visual to the point where I feel that the subtitles weren't necessary. I could of watched this movie on mute and still of found it engaging. There aren't too many films out there that can pull that off. People who might not like this film are probably people who have a problem with excessive amounts of violence. I feel this movie is a perfect film for those who like escapism. It really pulls you into its world for two hours making your really feel like you are right there in the movie.I give this movie a nine out of ten.",Apocalypto
608,katfish38,"Clichéd, predictable and boring",1,30 December 2006,"This is easily one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory. Not only was it incredibly predictable, but it was ridiculously drawn out. OK, I get it, they're a close knit tribe living in Central America. How many minutes can you really devote to demonstrating camaraderie? I literally dozed off during the first 15 mins of the film. And how about the scene in which the Mayans destroy the village and enslave the inhabitants? - fighting, more fighting, even more fighting, main character passes out, wakes up, still fighting, more fighting. This movie could have been made in half the time and been much more entertaining.SPOILERS Now, onto the clichés. Hmmmm... the main character is running from his captors and is confronted by a massive waterfall, hmmm... wonder what he's going to do here, jump, perhaps? Wow, he jumped, shocking. And c'mon, the quicksand scene? What is this, Land of the Lost? Oh, now the main character is on his home turf and he's going to fight back!! Yawn. And the baby being born during the last crucial moments? Did the screenwriters just graduate from screen writing 101 and think that they can create a movie fraught with tension simply by piling up bad situations on top of one another? That leads me to the final, predictable conclusion, which had me laughing out loud in theater - the arrival of the Spaniards? That was it, I was laughing so hard, I got up and walked out before the credits rolled.Finally, there was something about the film which really made me not care about any of the characters. Oh, I know what was missing - chemistry. Yeah, that's it. The entire time I was watching this, I felt like everyone was just going through the motions and I could've cared less about who lived or died. It was just bland and contrived.I was really disappointed, because Mel Gibson directed one of my favorite films of all time in Braveheart, but this was simply unoriginal and way too drawn out.

609,coolbluesound,Mel Gibson's Bigotry Reaches Back in Time,4,27 December 2006,"Despite horrible directing in jungle scenes (which are about 80% of the movie), the story of this movie could have made it OK... If it wasn't for Mel Gibson's self-righteous point in his story, highlighted by the quote in the beginning by Durant: ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" Here, the subtle argument that may have been unnoticed by the oblivious audience is that the Mayan civilization's demise was brought on by their wicked pagan ways and their lack of human values.What Mel Gibson does not care to mention in the movie, however, is that whatever violence (and ""evil"" if you're into that sort of categorization) had common place in Mayan or any other native civilization, was completely outdone in multiples by Christian European colonists, who spared nobody in what might have been the biggest massacre that the world has ever seen, improperly labeled as ""The Conquest"".What is next I wonder? Is he going to claim that the Jews had it coming in the Holocaust because of their ""wickedness""? I'm giving this a 4 because of the performances and the talent that went into it, despite its horribly wrong message but I think anybody in their right mind should do better than I did and not financially support the rantings of a fundamentalist bigot.",Apocalypto
610,SnaggleSnark,Violent Colonialist Propaganda,1,29 November 2007,"This film is visually stunning, which in most films would be a good thing.However, unless you enjoy seeing the Mayan people, who cannot speak for themselves, being displayed without any regard for historical or cultural accuracy, in a deeply sadistic and violent way, this very very long film will appal and revolt you.The characters are largely simplistic and stereotypical, serving mainly to highlight the inherent messages of the film, which seem to be that non-western/white/Christian peoples are inherently barbaric and violent, and so deserve to die out leaving the land to the apparently noble and brave incoming Spanish conquerors.The narrative is not so much told, as being a non-stop portrayal of every type of violence possible, often shown in slow motion and close up just in case you wanted to especially savour the moment.It should be noted that every portrait reflects the artist as well as the subject - in this case, as pure fiction, this film alone is a very nasty portrait indeed of Mel Gibson's psyche.In short, unless you like being intellectually manipulated, and emotionally sickened, do not waste any time or money on this rubbish.",Apocalypto

It mixes Maya and Aztec and different historical episodes but that's artistic license. It is disgustingly hypocritical of Hollywood types who love movies celebrating sadism and cruelty to claim moral outrage when the violence here is motivated by the plot and based on actual events. In fact the worst violence is in the viewers heads they don't actually see as much as they think.

612,petercrooks24,Campy entertainment masked as mega epic,5,5 December 2006,"Went and watched Apocalypto with a lively Berkeley audience last night. I'm still a little baffled by this movie. I think it will make its budget back big time, as I can see this having big worldwide appeal, particularly in Latin countries--so to the director's credit, he knows how to entertain his audience, and provides plenty of action Gibson does action and carnage as well as almost anyone, and he can through evil creepies in there. Mel's fetish for torture and violence is well-fed here. A scene of human sacrifice atop an Aztec pyramid reminded me of my younger days, when I thought Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was actually pretty cool. But the grown up me watched Apocalypto thinking about how much I enjoyed Terrence Malick's The New World.The final half houra chase through the jungle plays like a Saturday afternoon serial. The logistics of the action were so far fetched that they felt like Lowest Common Denominator film-making, and made the entire film seem pretty lightweight.Overall, I kind of enjoyed it as a campy horror-action piece. But as a meditation on the clashes of culture with metaphors to our modern world, it was simply too formulaic in content.Also of note: When the directed by Mel Gibson credit showed at the end of the film the boo- hisses outweighed the cheers 2 to 1",Apocalypto

614,chefmoviebuff,Almost a Masterpiece,7,9 December 2006,"This is one unique film: The Passion of the Christ meets Braveheart. This is a film that does not flinch, that is relentless in it's storytelling, that is brutal, honest and beautiful. Mel Gibson has taken yet another enormous gamble and has proved he is, strangely enough, a brilliant filmmaker. To tell a tale in ancient maya with it's original language is a huge risk simply because it can go so wrong so easily.Yet, having said that, this is a film that has a major flaw: the script. The script feels dry and preachy. Which is too bad because each and every performance is brimming with passion.The story deals with a small village in the jungles of central America. They are brutally attacked by the Maya and are brought back to it's capital. It's amazing that this small village has never made contact with this immense civilization, yet, geographically aren't very far. It is at least one day distance from each other. On this historic day, our hero is then saved by an extremely rare occurrence: a solar eclipse. Then we learn that his partner gives birth a few hours later (in a way that is completely preposterous) and, of course, the climax is such a whopper that I couldn't help but roll my eyes.What I am trying to say is that it is clear to me that Mel certainly has something to say and will use extreme measures to make his point. What are the odds that each of these four major moments in this man's life all happened in less than 24 hours! How many times have you seen an eclipse? Had a child born underwater? Apparently encounter a huge civilization that your village has never seen before, yet they are very close proximity? And, this one day, come the Europeans. Come on Mel! Be a little realistic! This film could have been a masterpiece yet Mel decided to get too preachy and forgot the story he was trying to tell.",Apocalypto

Apcadopeto,1,27 December 2006,"The scenes in the forest with the Mayans hunting the hero Jaguar Paw seemed right out of Predator every scene was derived from a film in a different genre. Like the sick girl who gives the prophecy--Damien Omen 3? And then the Children of the Corn part. And those subtitles. I loved the ""he's f--ked"" after the hokey snake bite (Anaconda?). The bad guy characters all sounded like they had been dropped out Saving Private Ryan. People whoo like this movie mustbe completely ignorant of great cinema. How many people who lokke this filmhave seen Aguirre, Wrath of God? ANything by Eisnetseiin, tarkovsky,Pabst, Bunuel, Fellini? It's like they think the velvet Elvis painting they saw at a lfea market is a great work of art, having never been to a museum to see the work of the masters. The real problem with Apcadopeto is not the gore (compared to Saw or Hostel, there is relatively little, and little that is very graphic). the problem is that the film is BOOOORRRRING! It is so predictable. I actually said ""now he is Jaguar Paw"" when he got all black from the goo in the swamp, and then he actually said ""Now I'm Jaguar Paw."" I knew the Spanish ships were there at the beach before the film cut to them. It's all like ""duh!""The ""accuracy"" of the language was made even more ridiculous by the fact that the film conflates the Mayans who vanished before the Spanish arrived) and the Aztecs. And then there was the teeth whitening of Jaguar Paw and his wife that begins at the near sacrifice of Jaguar Paw. By the end of the film, their teeth are totally white, and her hair looks much nicer. I loved the baby floating device! Of course, she is not at all angry for leaving her and making her eat dead monkey for all those weeks (or how long was he gone, anyway?).I thought the moral supplied by the Will Durant quotation at the beginning of the film---how can we go to the forest for a new beginning when it is being despoiled?-- was also off because the new beginning is what the fearful tribe was seeking (and look where that got them) and because the sacrifices were totally modernized mass executions, one after the other, rather than ritual sacrifices--hence all that Holocaust imagery. The view of Mayans as decadent was totally ahistorical. Gibson seems more into the Mayan spectacle of violence than he is into forest hunting (except when the game is a human and the hunted becomes the hunter).I don't know if Gibson is just a lot dumber than I thought he was or if he is now going after the video game teen boy market that films like The 300 and Pathfinder are going after. Hence, he feels he has to spell everything out for the audience and make everything completely intelligible. In any case, Mel Gibon has dubbed himself Smell Gibson. This film stinks!",Apocalypto
616,Saw3624,"Good Film-making, Bad Film",4,9 December 2006,"When I saw the trailer for this film a while back, I was so excited for it. It looked like a movie based around the rise and fall of the Mayan Civilization. It looked like a very surreal, very artistic view on the matter.In the end, however, the full movie is just an action-fest.There is probably enough blood in this film to feed the world population of cannibals for an entire year (even though there are only 10 cannibals).Some elements of the film were artistic, though. Not enough artistry at all, however. When I say ""some"", I mean ""2 or 3"" instances of artistry.The only thing I really liked about this movie was the cinematography. The green color in the jungle was vibrant and lush. It was beautiful. The camera movements were very smooth, too. Also, some shots, whether being first-person perspective, or eagle-eye view, were fantastic. I can see a lot of though went into making this film. I feel that it is lacking two very big things, though: An original, and good, plot; and artistry.If Blood and gore is artistry, then we are living in a sick world. This is far from artistry, and not in a good way, either.One more thing I found appalling was the ending. It may be historically accurate, but in reality, you are watching this film and thinking there will be an ending to end all endings. This is far from it.A good thing about the movie, other than cinematography, was the score. The score for the film blended very well with what was happening on-screen. It is pretty fantastic, actually. Don't be surprised if this gets an Oscar nomination for 'Best Score', honestly. One more good thing about he movie was the fact that it is in all subtitles. This factor actually immerses you in the Mayan world. You get lost in it.Breakdown-Pros: -Great Cinematography -Great Score -SubtitlesCons: -Ending was very anti-climactic -WAY too violent, and WAY too bloody -No real artistryOverall:This is not a film for everybody. If you wanted action in the first place, definitely check it out.

A collection of cinematic and literary clichés (indestructible hero, community that pays no attention to warnings of danger, pregnant woman in peril, bad guys who think nothing of pissing off their gods, to name a few) from start to finish, it's literally the kind of movie where you can walk out after the first hour and pretty much predict what's going to happen between that point and the end.

618,dave1606,Pretty good,8,28 November 2006,"Tonight I went to an advance screening of Mel Gibson's new film Apocalypto. This is an interesting movie for many reasons, the first being its Mayan language. I am hearing that this is actually considered a foreign film by the Golden Globes because of it, regardless of the movie originating from America. This could be written off as a gimmick, but it is one of the film's strongest points, the movie looks, feels, and sounds(despite for a few lines that needed to be edited out) authentic.What this movie is is gory. It is one of the bloodiest movies I have seen and should be avoided if blood bothers you. Here is a great scenic moment from the film. If this sounds too much for you than stay away because yes, it gets much worse.The captives are brought in covered in blue paint. They look up at the top of a vast temple where an executioner is thanking the lords as he rips the hearts out and decapitates their fellow men. The heads roll down the long stair case followed soon after by their bodies. The heart is put on hot rocks and thousands up people cheer. There are hundreds of heads on steaks all around.......This is the first movie I have ever been to where people actually walked out of the theater.Getting back to the movie itself there are quite a few good qualities as well. The acting is superb all around, I actually cared about the main character and his family. The prophecy made by the sick girl is a clever piece of writing as well as the dream the main character has. The empire of the main tribe is quite amazing and will take your breath away in both its horror and its beauty.The early scenes of humor are very nice and help us appreciate the characters and a nice break from the extreme violence that follows. The movie looks amazing, the characters designs and costumes are well done as is the sets. Finally, superb direction by Mel Gibson make all of this work together quite well.My main problems with this movie are these: The movie is too long (2 and half hours) and includes some surprisingly campy scenes. The birth in the well did not work for me at all. The last chase sequence is far too long and could have been cut in half.Overall I was slightly disappointed by this film. I wanted more Mayan culture and less running through the forest. However, Mel Gibson had something else in mind and I applaud him for making the movie he wanted to make. Despite my problems the film is quite good if you can make it through the gore. I would be highly surprised if this did well at the box office due to the extreme gore, other language language(Americans don't like subtitles), long running time, and of course the now infamous name of Mel Gibson attached. However I enjoyed the movie and might want to see it again. If you can believe that.",Apocalypto

Graphic, but realistic how they worshiped and took hearts to feed the God. The actors, who I did not know, were fantastic....one stood out, Raoul Trujillo was so commanding a presence, I was sad to see him die. Actually, all the warriors were threatening on screen, but as the movie went on you could define the definite leader (Zero Wolf) and his small band of warriors/followers showed such loyalties (and at times perhaps some fear) to Zero Wolf, they didn't question any word. At first I found myself listening to dialect and reading the subtitles, yet after viewing for awhile it felt natural to show both. It made me think about the culture, showing the lives in a jungle along with family life and the beliefs of the culture. I will buy this movie when it comes out. It also had me thinking of taking another trip to Yucatan and Belize. I have to applaud the movie locations, cinematography, casting, and those associated with the making of this film.

I mean, human sacrifice did occur, but not to the extent that is shown in the film. Rolling heads were not so typical for the Maya culture. Palenque did exist as a sacrifice Temple and its remains are breathtaking, but the fabulous aspects of material culture that we see in the reliefs, paintings, and burial remains imitated for the film looked poorly conceived. The ""human-hunting"" scene was great! The eclipse scene was perfect,too. Bue I felt something was missing, and that is the great Maya civilization and a real tribute to it.",Apocalypto

I don't mind violence at all but i sometimes wonder gibsons' motive in his movies since all of them are quite gruesome. I know he is trying to portray the times but his films aren't even historically accurate. Cortez landed about 600 years after the mayans fell and in a different part of the world.

If you like comedies, there's a yuck a minute in this one. Otherwise, don't waste your time. A total insult to your intelligence. What's the deal with Hollywood movie makers? A well made movie about the Mayan civilization and/or it's demise should be a film maker's dream. Instead, we are asked to check our brains at the door and get bombarded with stupidity. One example: our hero is seen ""outrunning"" a jaguar, shortly after pulling a deeply embedded arrow out of his back. Unfortunately, there's lot's more like this.

624,kular7,Apocalypse all over again,8,20 June 2007,"This is a magnificent film, despite the warranted criticism of the Director's personal life and how the film was stifled and stalled by controversy unjustly so. Too bad because this story is epic and monumental, a clash of cultures, sophisticated but primitive civilization encroaches upon those who live by the reality of the self-sustaining jungle, immersed by the understanding of their nature.It wasn't so long ago that we existed in a world of distorted ritual and superstition, (we still do) where once we had alchemy we now have chemistry. Where once astrology held sway. Astronomy is now the herald of the day. The symbolism of this movie works on so many levels. How the increasingly impoverished Mayas used the science of the eclipse to eclipse the fact of their own empires demise. Using science and observable fact as a mask for sacrifice and superstition. Themes repellent and relevant for today and a warning to those who steal ritual from nature to use as a means of control and power through shock and awe and fear in this we are all diminished by this spectacle of grandeur.Then there is the Shaman's apprentice bound to his own domain and the world his culture created gaining power as the run goes on. Jaguar sacrifice, man becomes jaguar, and in his own element the hunt is on. The hunter becomes the hunted. The goal is born out from the will of the individual, the rescue and survival of his family and culture combined to himself, his own identity becomes the retreat into the wilderness as an answer to preservation.We are all striving to survive in these changing times what matters are the quality of our intentions and the nobility immersed in our deeds.One culture advances and the other retreats, or is it just the other way around? I guess the point is does the purity of 'Eden' reside in its simplicity and the idea of living within your means? No matter how flawed this may be.",Apocalypto

626,dacoroman,"Now and then - Mirror, mirror on the wall!",10,28 December 2009,"I will begin positioning myself on this planet. I'm Romanian, European. At school we didn't learn too much about America's Precolumbian history, so, besides documentaries on TV I didn't have other information in the area.Why am I telling this? it's just to set my opinion regarding this movie. I've seen this movie 3 times now. There are many comments regarding the historical accuracy, about the mixing of the cultures in the same story. I've even read opinions that says that Apocalypto it is a racist movie. I think that Apocalypto it's a mirror of our current society and I will prove it in the following sentences.The movie is open to many interpretations and it's opening the door for many debates. The first thing that hits the viewer is the violence, explicit, in your face, detailed. One of the reviewers said that if he wants to see violence he would look to Al Jazeera. Ironically, violence is one of the main characters in this movie, like in most of Gibson's movies (POC & Braveheart). Though is soaked in blood I cant see Apocalypto as a thriller of horror movie. Apocalypto's Violence is a meaningful one; it has its part. It is a ""modus vivendi"", a way of life. Violence, with more or less purpose, is attached to human civilization and accompanied us since the beginning of human as specie until now. Though we conquered the space and embraced peaceful religions we still tolerate and preach violence. Right at this moment, outside your house, in your own town violence is happening to a bigger or smaller scale. Right at this moment in the next room your child is playing a violent computer game. Right now there are wars on this planet and people are dying. Does the sacrifice has a meaning? Does the sacrifice in the movie had a real meaning? No, just a religious and mystical one. So from this perspective, Apocalypto paints in thick lines an ancient image of the present society. They were preaching violence then, we are preaching the violence now and we don't have to switch the TV to Al Jazeera.Many says that the movie doesn't have historical accuracy. It doesn't need historical accuracy. The movie is not a historical one. Actually, the movie is doing a great thing to history. It opens our eyes regarding something we've took for granted and sets us on research, at least this is what have done for me. I realized that I don't know many things about that part of the world in that period of time. Apocalypto just made me curious and opened my appetite for America's Precolumbian History. Once again Apocalypto it is not a historical movie and history is not its purpose. Establishing real facts, places, cultures, etc is the job of documentaries. This movie is fiction. The characters' nationality and their positioning in time was just to serve Gibson's purpose, to deliver a message regarding the decadence of the present society and to show that even we pretend ourselves civilized there is not difference between an Aztec/Mayan Politician and a politician today. Just take the Priest's speech and put it next to any present politician's speech ....anywhere on this planet. There is no difference. People of then as people of now needed bread and circus, and this is what they were getting and this is what we are getting. From this perspective it is a political movie. To support my idea just watch Gibson's interviews on youtube or the interview of Rudy Youngblood, also on youtube (the one where he stays in front of a Comanche flag - as I understood, sorry if I'm wrong). Rudy says: ""It is the way of life, that's the way they lived, [...] but in a sense it is kinda in your face 'Hey, wake up! this is what's going on now, why cant you see that?'"" And it is right in your face. The problem with the truth and self-image is that not many of us are capable of self-assessment and we have a distorted image of ourselves as individuals or as nation/culture. The image from the Apocalypto mirror is difficult to digest because it shakes common believes and we need a little bit of courage to look and to see ourselves as we really are.These has been said, I will end my comment toward Apocalypto acclaiming the actors' performances and all the other things that made this movie to be so great. For instance, I couldn't believe that this was Rudy's first movie. His performance was flawless. On the other hand I'm sad to see that this was the only movie for Dalia Hernandez (Seven). I really liked her beauty and sensibility, though you could see a lot of power inside her character. All the actors were great actually. The faces, the expressions are amazing. I just have in my eyes the face of the woman in the water looking back to her children, the face of the prophecy girl, the emperor stateliness, the priest's trickery smile... amazing. One of the best movies I ever seen. It's a movie to be seen again. I'm just anxious to see Gibson's next project.",Apocalypto

630,docshaman,Film Review of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto & Relevance to Sociology,8,8 May 2008,"This is an interesting commentary on contemporary social organization. The film is based on Mayan culture and shows a once advanced society in the throes of disorganization and fall. One can easily see analogies to Roman civilization, but more importantly one may see parallels to the current world situation, especially the West. The US evolved from strict religious values to a progressive society where anything goes. There are still some that cherish these values, but the media and those who control society seem to be on this similar road to destruction suggested by the film. The primitives in the forest are examples of our hunting and gathering roots. These are simple yet strong survivors that seem to be living a content existence. They show respect for the environment in which they live. There is a strong communal identity and the group is strongly knit together. This film relates to sociology directly in that it portrays a graphic example of a society, one from which our ancestors began the journey. The hunters and gatherers, and slash and burn horticulturists are shown in contrast to the more advanced Mayan society. There are no slaves among the hunters and gatherers, or social class distinctions, as found in the Mayan structure. This alone is a strong definition of the differences between two societies. The role of gender is also evident. The men are warrior/hunter types, and the women take care of the children and stay near the hearth. Whether women are subordinate or equal was not clear to me since each role is important in a society. Most viewers will only pick up on these distinctions in passing. They stream through the middle of the film and clear examples of how as one advances from primitive to advanced, class distinctions emerge. The main culprit, if you will, as the sociologist loudly proclaim, is the accumulation of surplus and those who control it. Scientific farming techniques, the irrigation system (which is shown in disrepair and polluted among the Mayans) combines to imply a civilization in decline. The last scene is only a prophecy of more horror as the Spaniards (most likely Cortez, or even Columbus, since the imagery and imputations are somewhat vague, but impressive none the less), are seen landing on the shores of the rain forest. We know what happened after that.There is a great deal of history jumbled up in this film and as far as I can determine (only those who lived through it could ever know for sure) the film represents an historical summary of what we have been told by those who are supposed to know. I thought it was an entertaining film for introduction to sociology classes to view, at least for its commentary on societies and their evolution. I leave the implications to the viewer.",Apocalypto
631,steelman-5,"Singular film, intimate portrayal, hidden agendas",9,11 December 2006,"The movie was singular, not like any other including the director's other works. It was an intimate portrayal of indigenous people, their daily lives as well as a tragic struggle thrust upon them. The portrayal was noble. Yes, the movie was bloody as were those times...for those who want a whitewashed view, find another movie spoken in Mayan...good luck with that! Curiously, if you read the negative reviews carefully, many but not all of them appear to be disingenuous attacks on the movie. It seems as though many of those reviewers simply have an agenda to disparage the movie and discourage as many people as possible from attending.

633,peterg2806,One of the worst films I have ever seen,1,27 January 2007,"In one word, Apocalypto was awful. Right from the beginning it was disappointing, and never got going in any way. Although the majority of reviewers acclaim the movie, I cannot help wondering whether I watched the same film as they did. It was too long, riddled with inaccuracies, and a plot which made ancient tribes of the region seem like monsters. The opening sequence, in which a man eats a wild pig's testicles, had me contemplating leaving through complete disgust, but I decided to stay in the hope that things would improve. It didn't - if anything it got worse. What I could not work out was why Jaguar Paw put his family into a well, when he could have just told them to run into the jungle. After the 'goodies' are captured, we are treated to about 30 minutes of watching people walking, and being degraded. This could have been compressed into about 5 minutes. The violence was just too much to stomach. I am not easily put off by blood and gore, but Mel Gibson took it many steps too far, with effects that wouldn't have been out of place in 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. The problem with Apocalypto is that it focused on the wrong things, and when the film ends, loose ends are not tied up. What happened to the rest of the tribe? What happened to Jaguar Paw and his family? What happened with the Spanish? This film is similar to Passion of the Christ. Gibson tried to be different, and to some it worked, and to others - including me - it was just a film I wish I hadn't wasted 2 hours of my life watching.

Imagine a movie where you cannot understand a single word of dialog but the film is clear. Many of my positive comments have already been covered in other reviews: Impressive cinematography, unobtrusive sound track that adds greatly to the film, wonderful acting, striking beauty, realistic and continual action, interesting treatment of anthropology suggesting that maybe we have not changed so much in the last several hundred years.Maybe a unique view is that as a biologist this film is worth seeing if only for the nature photography.

636,harkinsjamie,Brilliant Entertainment,8,20 June 2021,"This film took me by surprise. Mel Gibson showed with Braveheart that he can direct violence and action as well as almost anyone. Well, when you remove the overdone romance, and frankly ludicrous historical inaccuracies of that film, then transplant the whole thing to Amazon jungle a couple of hundred years later, you get Apocalypto.A story of tribal rivalry and human slavery, it's fabulously done from top to bottom. Some of the action/chase sequences are truly breathtaking, made all the more impressive by the fact that Gibson also does a terrific job of making sure you're emotionally invested in the characters. And with very little dialogue at that.It really is a wonderful adventure story, with a nice little contextual twist at the end to boot.Highly recommended.",Apocalypto

He is my personal hero, the way he recreated this civilization on film was breathtaking. Cause this is what the Maya people did, they did cut the hearts of their own unwilling people to show their appreciation to the gods. They were brutal and they were savages. And the message does represent what is happening in the world today. The beginning of this movie is funny and really makes you like the characters. You believe it, you recognize it. It doesn't feel like a movie, it feels like life. But it isn't all fun and games, yes this is a gory film. There are scenes where they cut out men's hearts and put it on a pillar as it slowly stops beating. The people cheer as the executioner decapitates the sacrifice and rolls his head down a gigantic aztec temple. But it is not truly gory, the idea is yes. This is a romantic action thriller that sumbits you to a world of adrenaline. Do yourself a favor and the box office and see this movie.",Apocalypto
638,zoda12321,a historically inaccurate masterpiece.,10,1 December 2007,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I knew I had to see it. After waiting a year for it to come out on DVD I finally rented it on my 22nd birthday. Having never seen a Mel Gibson movie and not knowing what to expect I was pleasantly surprised.This movie is truly a masterpiece. Every aspect is top notch. The characters, the duologue, the costumes, the camera work, the location, the music, all of it is beautiful and very well done.The accuracy of the film is so, a lot of work was done into making things look true to life, however this movie is fictional. There are changes made such as the colors of the pyramids and the incorporation of human sacrifices, which is more of an Aztec ritual and still unproven to have happened during the time of the Mayans. Unless you are watching this movie for a historical representation of the Mayans this should not be a problem. Most of us will be watching this movie as fiction. Even the eclipse is fictional, they don't happen that fast, but no one said this movie has to be accurate, 300 was much less accurate and it still got a lot of attention.It would be nice if this movie was completely accurate, but would it be as good a movie? Who knows. I personally love the take. Because of the additions to this movie there is an aspect of human truth that was included. This movie ends up representing the story of almost all Native American tribes and the story of many other people who's societies eventually haven fallen.While the movie had many great moments and some interesting foreshadowing (the campfire story, the creepy little girl) it was the final scene which blew me away. Regardless of Mel Gibson's beliefs and whatever his intended meaning was, the ending is very much tragic and subjective. The way it's presented is much more the product of the way this movie is shot. As a photographer it's very apparent that this movie uses it's camera work (as well as it's audio work) to place the viewer in the movie.From the start to the end you follow Jaguar Paw on his horrific struggle after having his ""world"" stolen away. Once you go through his struggle to return to his family and battle off his capturers you finally are shocked at the end moment where everything he has gone through and everything his enemies have gone through is shattered by the arrival of the Spanish settlers. I am a white male and I was terrified when it got to this scene, You really do lose yourself in it. This is the story of all people. The love of your family, of your home, your culture, the struggle to preserve this and the natural rise and a fall of all civilizations.So who knows about Mel Gibson and honestly, who cares? This film isn't about him. Take it as you will, but to me it is in no way justifying the Christians who arrive at the end.Just a note: While rituals and practices were not all the true to life the people in this movie actually speak Mayan and the Spanish did actually arrive around the fall of the Mayans. Europeans did arrive and conquer native people and the one scene at the end may be the most accurate representation of what that would be like. There doesn't need to be a brutal horrific slaughter of natives at the end of this movie, you already know that this means things are going to change.I love this movie.",Apocalypto
639,mxrcxdxs,<-historical and cultural implications of the film->,10,11 December 2006,"This film was shocking, original, and shows not only Mel Gibson's artistic ability as a director, but his brilliance in pandering to what an broad audience really wants out of a movie. At the same time, the film seems to be steeped in political controversy of having a racist and colonial agenda. Mel Gibson has proved himself to be quite culturally insensitive, and his deploring public have rushed to psychoanalyze 'Apocalypto' as synonymous with the director's disreputable behavior. Furthermore, I think it it dangerous to create an allegory about the decline of empires using a culture that was ultimately colonized by the West.However, Gibson (and Farhad Safinia) chose the Maya civilization, which mysteriously disappeared almost 300 years before the Spanish, who historically invaded the Aztec empire. The Spanish never actually had any contact with dissipated remnants of a once great Mayan civilization. This secures the film within the realm of historical fiction. Furthermore, I think the Postcolonial theorists, who presume the arrival of the West at the end of the film signifies some ultimate salvation, are too immersed in their own prejudices to honestly judge the film. By now, the colonization of indigenous Native Americans is almost unilaterally agreed as nothing but perhaps the greatest genocide in history, but don't hide behind utopian fantasies of passive precolombian culture. And yes, the costumes and locations are represented as exquisitely exotic, but the entire movie is about giving agency and humanity to a ""lost civilization."" And yes, the incredible sociological and technological advancements of the Mayans were downplayed in the film, but the movie had another message, namely that civilizations are by nature built upon the sweat, tears and blood of a slave underclass. Egyptians had Jews and many others, Romans had Greeks and plenty more, Post-Enlightenment Europe had Africa and South Asia. And in a more global community today, the United States has its thumb pressing upon the poor of most nations. And I wish obviously privileged people would stop their bloody battlecry for political correctness. Anyone enjoying the comforts and amenities of 'modern civilization' is participating in a colonizing, oppressive agenda. As for the film, Gibson stated that he meant it to be perceived as allegory for the futility of the Iraq war, which quite surprised me. Finally, the film is beautifully shot, and while quite gory (which again is I think a commentary on current violence), has brilliant pacing and incredible cinematography. Furthermore, I think that it would be hailed as a miracle of tolerance if anyone else besides Mel Gibson made a mainstream movie in an indigenous language using indegenous peoples. Finally, though its only supposed to be a chase movie, the film succeeds fantastically.",Apocalypto
640,sivex,excess,7,2 November 2007,"I think, like in almost all of Mel Gibson's movie, here are too much sensations.Mr. Gibson is too focused on showing let's say ""the roots"" of mankind; he presents eviscerations, eating fresh meat, a lot of blood to be ""as closer to how it was"". This is not the point...this should be only the support or in the movie is the main point.The costumes were very nice, but I was expected to see more deep things related to the Mayan culture. Anyway I did not want to see the movie, it was exactly as I expected...the same way like in ""Passion of Christ"". My vote 7/10.",Apocalypto
641,chencho,the damage has been done,1,29 January 2007,"This is not a hate-review. That said, and being a Mexican of little or none Mayan descent, I feel I have to explain why I see apocalypto as a poor movie. From IMDb posts and comments elsewhere you can see a lot of people feel angry and aggravated. It's comprehensible if you take your time to read a bit about Mayan culture, which is not only mispictured, but mistaken in several occasions for the Aztec culture. A lot of the movie is just historically impossible. Taking as an example ""Braveheart"", one could simply accept the errors and misconceptions which happen in both movies as an effort for thrusting visually or emotionally some takes just to make it a blockbuster film. But the truth is that in Apocalypto they just invented a family-hero story, with the Mayan decadent surroundings as a subplot. It is very disheartening to see the amount of racist, uninformed, furious, and just plain stupid discussions taking place over what could have been a great movie, if the makers only took some time to research. I thank Mel Gibson for using the actors and locations he did, and taking an interest on a culture that is seldom pictured or referenced by Hollywood. The thing is he missed the chance of portraying a magnificent culture, and turned into a mere fictional and historically misleading story. That mislead is damage already done. People are wondering about nonsense, and insulting each other for being stupid or illiterate, weather they like the film or htey hate it. I'll just write some of the errors: 1.-The Spaniards never arrived by ship to Mayan land -not a spoiler, don't worry. 2.-The mayans did perform human sacrifice, but no hearts nor heads were offered ""as a way to calm kukulkán (the sun god)"". The whole sacrifice scene is incorrect. It seems the ""advisors"" thought of Aztecs, which did take out human hearts of the captured warriors.(None of the main story elements are spoiled by saying this) 3.-The filthy huts, the clothing, the hunting, and almost every day to day reference of how people lived in those days are falling short of a lie. It is true the time frame is upon the decadent part of the Mayan empire, but sadly no mention of the bright parts of Mayan life are shown. Even the History channel knows about that part. 4.-(possible spoiler) The place in which the slaves are told to run and get hunted down in a cat&mouse fashion, resembles a lot to a ""ball game"" court, a game named in Maya ""pok-ta-pok"", which is a sacred practice and would have never been used in that way. If you believe it, people still play that game -some 500 years after the conquest, and say a 1500 years since it started. 5.-The Mayan pyramids never ever had wooden stairs nor woodwork beside them. That much I'm certain of. 6.- (possible spoiler) The steps had the purpose to be climbed over, not to serve as a bowling alley for human heads, as its shown on the movie. Again, bloody sacrifices were performed by the Aztecs in very particular times. 7.- (possible spoiler) The eclipse is shown as a coincidence, and a surprise to all but the ""grand-priest"". Such occasions would have been addressed in a very different manner, even in the worst times of Mayan rule.My words try not to enlighten, educate, tell-off, nor to insult no one. This is only a movie, yes, but think of all the people that take all they know of history from movies, and believe Spartacus is make-believe but rocky is alive and boxing again. Shalom",Apocalypto
642,archbishopshaggy,Incredibly disappointing,4,10 April 2007,"I don't even know where to begin on this movie. Having majored in anthropology in university and having taken most of my electives centered around Mesoamerican archaeology, I have a decent level of working knowledge about Mayan civilization and culture. There were tons of errors in this area, but most of the potential movie watchers really wouldn't care about this. However, I would still like to point out that from all the architecture, artworks, and from the actual type and amount of sacrifices being made, there is no way that this even comes close to being a true representation of 16th century Mayan civilization. Nearly everything represented would point to a much earlier time period, thus eliminating the possibility of the Spanish arriving. Now on to the main point, the story itself was nowhere near epic. For all the money, and effects and sets and costumes, the central story itself was not that great. It wasn't bad, just not so good. The combat and fighting displayed was sub par for a big budget historical thriller, especially with Gibson at the helm, and several parts were just not believable. Chief among these was the fact that even though the village was all of a few days walk from the massive temple complex, these villagers seemed to have no apparent idea that it existed. This of course just flies in the face of simple common sense, people that close would have full knowledge of this city and probably have constant contact with the people dwelling there. This proximity would also have categorized the villagers as being under the rule of this central power, and thus would not likely have been a target of their raids and prisoner captures. Mainly this movie was just a large disappointment, and was nowhere near what I would have expected from Mel Gibson, it was a sub-par effort by him, and the basic underlying plot was not well fleshed out, nor was there enough of it to justify a movie this long. Most of the time was spent to parade sets and costumes in front of the camera and try to wow audiences with them. If you are a stickler for historical accuracy, or at least want some degree of it and know something about the Maya, then give this movie a miss. If you want an epic story then give it a miss.

644,blandie-1,Gibson 101,10,4 June 2007,"This man has the sense to make movies which have never been made before. The way the story was told makes the movie seem to drag at first then it explodes into a statement of overcoming personal fears. His aspect of the viewer's angle is amazing. I think he has surpassed Brave Heart in the boldness of the tale. To use unknowns make the story seem like a glimpse of actual events. Mel's writing skills allow him to drown us in the feelings of the characters. I am not sure why he decided to leave the original language again (as he did in the Passion), but you forget that you are reading subtitles as you become Mayan for two short hours.",Apocalypto
645,tetanurae,"Very good in parts, and very very bad in parts",6,9 December 2006,"I saw Apocalypto yesterday afternoon because I was genuinely curious what the movie would be like. I left conflicted as the movie is really good and really bad at the same time.The Good: 1) Acting in general was quite good and it was exciting to see so many native actors.2) Costuming was also quite impressive, detailed, intricate, and diverse. It's honestly award-worthy.3) The scenes in and around Generic Mayan City were incredible, believable, and amazing. This is the first and only time I can say I've had a genuine feel for what a Pre-Columbian city in Central America would have actually been like, despite having visited some, seen tons of dioramas, and Discovery Channel CGI. If these were real sets (I imagine a lot of it was CGI), they deserve awards.The Bad: 1) No one in Jaguar Paw's village seemed to know anything about the fact there was a huge city full of hostile people less than two days walk from them. They seem genuinely shocked that they were being attacked and genuinely curious as to where they were going. This would be akin to people in Anaheim being unaware of the existence of Los Angeles....2) The scenes of human sacrifice seem to be much more in line with what actually happened in Aztec cities, not Mayan, and even then on these types of sacrifices happened on extremely rare occasions.3) The Maya were arguably the best astronomers in the pre-scientific world and would have known an eclipse was coming. It probably wouldn't have surprised the crowd and certainly wouldn't have surprised the priests.4) After Jaguar Paw escaped he ran, and ran, and ran, and ran without stopping for literally 36 hours. And he was shot with arrows. Twice! And he jumped off the top of a waterfall at least 50 feet high! If he's such an invincible superman, how the hell did he get captured in the first place? 5) The scenes of Seven and Turtle Run (Jaguar Paw's wife and child) trapped in the well are superfluous, and well... silly. Add to that the fact that a few hours of rain causes the well to fill up with 6 to 8 feet of water despite the fact that it was empty when they went down into it.6) The gore was overdone. I'm not saying this as a person who is afraid of blood (although if you are afraid of blood, do not see this movie), but someone who can see the line between necessary and excessive. Hunting, human sacrifice, and animal maulings are all real things that really are really bloody. But do we need to see a jaguar chew a man's face off? For three scenes? Does blood rhythmically squirting out of a wound really need to be seen? After the gore-fest we've endured Jaguar Paw finally kills his main tormentor with a blow to the head, but it just seemed cartoonish and over the top it caused the entire theater to erupt in laughter.7) AND THEN THE Spanish SHOW UP! Talk about anachronistic! The decline of the classical Maya civilization happened almost 600 years before the Spanish arrived in Maya lands, and the great cities with the stepped pyramids were abandoned and overgrown with jungle at that time. Shall we have Elizabeth I and Shakespeare talking on cell phones in movies from now on? I could live with this movie if it was about the decline of the Aztecs, and the last days of Tenochtitlan, as almost nothing would have to be changed, but forcing the Maya into this framework just sinks the movie.",Apocalypto
646,mircea_dragan,A movie in search of an audience,9,13 December 2006,"I liked this movie - the only reason I haven't given it 10/10 is that I felt the base line story was somehow cliché - (spoiler) young warrior avenging his pillaged village and family (end spoiler) - but the original setting and the numerous quirks in the script more than compensates for it. The directing is excellent, so is the acting , the soundtrack and the visuals. I cannot help but wonder, though, how many of the viewers actually 'connect' to this movie? Some of the previous comments stated the annoying giggling and background noises made by some of the members of the audience as detracting from the overall experience - I had the same fate myself and it does seem to be a trend - so one has to ask, apart form the history buffs and the philosophic-inclined ones who will watch the movie as a meditation over what gives really meaning to life (I consider myself both, and yeah, I do enjoy watching a mouth-smashin' mace as much as anyone :-))- who is going to *really* watch this movie and like it - and for what reasons , especially when thinking of the US-centered,popcorn and soda culture of today's western world.",Apocalypto
647,jpj-333,"Good, but totally misrepresented by the trailers.",5,7 January 2007,"I saw the trailer for this when I saw Casino Royal before Christmas. The trailer did a great job of promoting an exiting and intelligent looking film about the end of the Myan civilization. I couldn't wait to see it and was expecting an epic about social decline, religious extremism and fierce internal conflicts or battles with the Spanish invaders that wiped them out.Sadly the film has almost nothing to do with any of that, or indeed the end of the Myan civilization, and is actually a fairly simple adventure story based around 1 main characters journey back to his family.This in itself is fine but I am very angry that the film was promoted with the deliberate intention to mislead. The trailer I saw had no dialogue, but included captions such as ""As a civilization comes to an end"" and the movie itself begins with a quote about how a civilization must be undone from within before being undone from without"", all of which were intended to reinforce the idea that you were about to watch a film about the collapse or end of a civilization.It is all the more disappointing as the film is in fact good enough to stand on its own merits, as it is fast paced, gripping and exiting, rather than pretending to be about a much bigger story. Am I to blame for this misinterpretation? I think not. Even the name Apocalypto tends to conjure the notion of an apocalyptic type demise. This name was carefully chosen and is a brilliant title, if the movie bore any relation to it whatsoever.Now that you have been warned, feel free to go ahead and enjoy the movie anyway. I just feel sorry that I would have enjoyed it so much more if my expectations hadn't been shot to the moon before seeing it.",Apocalypto
648,brendangrehan,Great Movie,8,7 January 2007,"What a great movie. Why can't the critics give Mel Gibson a break. Yes the film is violent but the violence is no worse than in other action movies. Forget the critics go and see this movie, you won't be sorry. It has one of the finest chases ever in cinematic history and it worth the price of admission for that alone. Okay it doesn't start particularly well and after the first 10 minutes one might think to leave the cinema as its a fairly rough start. But the acting is very good and in the Mayan leader we have someone to take away Magua's crown (Wes Studi in Last of the Mohicans) as most evil screen Indian.He really looks the business in his headdress and his hand gestures. He looks like he would make a great wing-forward in rugby. So beat the critics and enjoy the movie.",Apocalypto
649,salvadorhgr,"Absurdly incoherent, made for ignorant people",2,9 March 2021,"The flick is as realistic as Avatar or Star Wars. Mel Gibson claimed they had archeological experts as consultants, however there are HUGE inconsistencies and fallacies, regarding...well, everything:
Mayans were fairly socially advanced, at least the way they dressed.They were advanced enough to predict eclipses.Mayan civilization and society collapsed 600 years before spanish conquerors arrived. Their cities were ceremonial places for the towns in which they remained, not as this piece of trash depicts.There were Mayan cities, towns and villages everywhere. This thing depicts totally isolated uncivilized tribes instead, like if they were amazonians (i.e. no agriculture, utterly primitive houses)Mayans sacrificed people, but not at the rate they described in this exaggerated bs, but mostly prisoners of inter-city wars, small groups from time to time.The animals, props, vestuary, are very inaccurate: a tapir making monster-pig noises, a couple of birds natives from China and Europe, very exaggerated makeup and vestuary (or lack of it in other cases).In general, I think Mel Gibson just hates latin people, and wanted to destroy the memory all and any piece of culture that has ever existed in latinamerica, because he is a fanatic.",Apocalypto

It's one of the most violent films I have ever seen. I am happy that I watched it at home, where I could have my lights on. It is a horrific reminder of the general evilness that resides in Man. I watch these films and become reminded of the horrors in Gaza, the Holocaust, Darfur, etc, because at the end of the day, people have been evil since the dawn of time. I wasn't familiar with the Mayan empire, and I would imagine that Mel has taken some liberties, but let's face it, the Aztecs were horrid, so it's possible that this has some truth. The cinematography in this film is amazing. And as someone who enjoys ""reading"" her movies, I found the dialogue accurate and the acting worthwhile.

652,zarplex2003,Great Film That's Really Worth Your Time (But Very Violent),8,11 September 2007,"As much as I hate to admit this about myself, I am a desensitized individual. This film was not as gory as I had imagined it to be, especially when you consider that I have already been exposed to Mel Gibson's The Passion. The infamous head rolling scene that you'll hear everyone talk about was actually filmed from a distance, so it's not like you see that much detail from all the rolling heads. One of the grossest scenes (in my opinion) is actually in the beginning of the film when a bunch of hunters kill a wild boar and start dismembering it in various regions along its body. I think if you can sit through this scene, you'll do just fine throughout the rest of the film. However, be warned that I didn't give complete detail about what is dismembered on this animal; I'll leave that to the imaginations of the readers of this comment. =) With that set aside, I really think this is one of the most creative, innovative, ingenious films done by Mel Gibson. If Mel Gibson is to ever read this comment, which I highly doubt, I must say, ""Great job Mel!"" I really feel he worked hard, thought hard, and was very passionate about this one. He introduced a new world that is completely unknown to me, alien even. However, what he was depicting was very real and definitely of this world. The historic accuracy of course remains questionable, but there is very little information left today that can tell us a whole lot about Mayan civilizations.In a nutshell, the storyline consists of a Mayan tribe that deals with what could've been very typical issues for their time. However, their lifestyles are dramatically changed when their town is ravaged by a group of Mayan warriors who wish to sell them off as slaves, have them ritualistically sacrificed, or do whatever else that they may deem as profitable or entertaining. The parallels that exist between the civilization that these warriors come from and Today's society are really cool. Within this civilization you see individuals obsessing over fashion, worshipping wealth, and performing acts of cruelty for trite and meaningless causes. The action in this movie is great as well as the acting, cinematography, and musical score. This highly unique movie will fill you with excitement and will leave you on the edge of your seat, but will do so in a way that is unexpected. For these reasons, I give this movie an eight out of ten. Mel Gibson should feel pretty proud about this work.",Apocalypto
653,Benny37,A Clever Metaphor for Our Present World,8,12 January 2007,"After coming home from seeing this film, I couldn't help but consider how relevant this film is to the world as it is today. Some might consider it a stretch, but i disagree when i suggest that the scene in which we see the human sacrifices, reminds me of the current US government, and their sacrifice of human life. Knowing little of the ""End of Days"" theory, discussed among evangelicals, It seems fitting that the ""uncivilised"" mayans, in this film also think that this is their doom time. Perhaps this is true, and the Chinese, will become the Spanish in the closing of the film.Other than that, I feel that Mel has given this film a great atmosphere, with some entertaining set pieces, and effects, which also left me wondering what was CG, and puppet or even live action, especially the Panther scene.",Apocalypto

I guess this movie will have a love-it-or-hate-it charisma to it (girls will probably hate it in greater numbers, I reckon), but for what it's worth, I absolutely loved this one. It grips firmly (''Speed'' - style in the jungle) from the very beginning to the end, the plot is straightforward but deep enough and devoid of too much cheesiness, the storytelling is neat, acting is great, scenography seems accurate and very convincing, and it even managed put my high levels of gore-resistance to test, since it seems Gibson perfected the use of some really nasty, Tarantino-is-nothing-compared-to-this gore in a wise and selective manner - only as a powerful enhancer of true context.

And just killing of everyone?Portraying the mayan's or aztecs as something out night of the living dead, or new england during the same period. And what was up with that plague.

I did not merely flinch - I literally squirmed for almost the entirety of this film.However, there is so much more to Apocalypto than a near-pathological level of violence.

658,awhoughton,"Strange, different, engrossing and interesting",10,12 December 2006,"This movie isn't really like anything coming out of the studios. All through it, though, you see the details and the touch of a great production and a great director. The actors, not encumbered by too many seminars or acting lessons, look and feel real. The scenery, sets, landscape and action are beautifully shot.The action keeps things moving and is compelling. The bad guys are horrible yet human beings also. There is a scene where the leader of the raiders on the village gives his son a knife to welcome him to manhood. You see the pride, and if not for the evil they just perpetrated on the village it would be a touching moment.Another side moment comes between a friend of the main character and his mother-in-law after the capture. No words are spoken, yet the images and the emotions tell it all.Underneath all of the action and the violence are the images of barbarity contrasted with the tender human moments of the main character and his family. The barbarity of the city dwellers and the overall rotting decadence of their society shows them on the brink of their own destruction. It's powerful without being preachy, and manages to walk a fine line of being able to present heavy concepts and the action that propels the movie.It's different and strange because it's not the kind of thing that anyone would see coming out of Hollywood these days. It's a mixture of many different concepts, ideas and motifs that somehow comes together into something special.Very recommended. The violence wasn't as much as some have said. Maybe my wife and I watch too much CSI, but it wasn't a distraction to the story and instead fit in well.",Apocalypto

I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action and picturesque cinematography, and who don't mind all out gore and allusions to rape. It is also unintentionally hilarious at times, particularly in one scene for its use of a horrendously fake animatronic jaguar. It honestly looks like a sock puppet with buttons for eyes and with strings moving its legs. Awful. I swear I could see its seams. So yeah, Gibson gets no points for that. And he gets no points for the 'prophetic diseased girl' character. Worst use of exposition character ever. Talk about deus ex machina. It was completely unnecessary and jolted the flow of the film.

Huh??? Why don't we just sit back and relax and enjoy the movie for what it is? A rush-based movie that tests the limit of our endurance and craving for blood, gore and unadulterated hand-to-hand combat of the purest kind? It has awesome visualisation, cinematography, costumes and some very good acting which is slightly handicapped by the actors having to emote out of a phrase book .but some of the effects of those are washed away by the question that you're faced with at the end of the movie.

The sets are hauntingly detailed, there are many memorable shots and set pieces that stick out in my mind even well after the film ended.

662,tjw387,One of the top films of the year. It has a lot of heart I think this movie will set in stone the talent that is Mel Gibson,10,10 December 2006,"Where to start, well first thing is this movie definitely isn't for everybody. It is brutally violent at parts with on screen be-headings and so on. If you were able to get through Mel Gibson's last film The Passion of The Christ then you should be able to get through this film just fine. The film itself is absolutely beautiful and every shot is breathtaking. It is without a doubt the most beautifully shot film to date. Mel Gibson really takes this film to the next level and proves himself as a phenomenal storyteller. The film is perfectly paced and adrenaline filled. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time never wavering for a second. The film drags you into an unknown world and is the reason I go to the movies in the first place. To escape somewhere and what Mel Gibson has achieved is the greatest action/adventure story this year.The film opens up to a hunt and starts out warmhearted and still very realistic as if it was documentary footage. Then the violence comes as the Mayan's look for men to sacrifice to their gods and for women to sell into slavery. The first half of the film is their journey to the Mayan kingdom and the when they arrive, and it is epic. The city comes alive and the temples are vivid and beautiful. Then the horror comes and you see that beyond the beauty is heads on pikes and pits of thousands of headless bodies. Some of the gore scenes in this film are far scarier then any horror film I've seen in recent memory.The acting in this film is superb. What makes this come as a surprise is that Mel Gibson cast all inexperienced and unknown actors in the roles, yet they are all very convincing. If you were worried about the subtitles don't be they are brief and well done. What really drives this film is the music. Apocalypto has by far the best soundtrack in years. It's riveting at its core and haunts you long after this film has passed. So to conclude if you have the time you must see this film. It is epic in every way possible, it is also an allegory for today's society, so don't miss out on Mel Gibson's Apocalypto.",Apocalypto
663,dcwidman,Technically excellent but been done before.,6,12 December 2006,"This isn't a bad movie at all. In fact, I enjoyed it. It just wasn't as original as I thought. I wanted to learn more about Mayan culture. As a result it was just parts of other movies set in Mayan days. For example, the opening hunting scene is similar to the opening hunting scene in The Last of the Mohicans. The second part is like Dances with Wolves when we learn that natives have emotions and feelings, where they laugh and joke, and where some experience sexual frustrations. The third part is like Tears of the Sun (and many other movies) where one dominant native tribe raids villages of more gentler tribes and then (much like the TV Mini series Roots) where natives are taken away as slaves leaving dead or dying family members behind. Our hero is saved just in the nick of time by a ""total eclipse of the sun."" How convenient. And, how often does that happen? In other words it is a ""plot contrivance,"" where something happens because if it didn't our hero would be dead and the movie would be over. And, the last part is (dare I say) like Rambo where bad guys are killed one by one by the good guy they are chasing in the forest/swamp etc. It is very well filmed, and the Mayan culture is interesting although I would have preferred to see more of it. Was there anything good about the city people? Did these people have any of the same feelings as the forest people? Or were they just ritualistic madmen? In the end, though, this is more a movie for Action Genre fans. And, because it is graphically violent it will (and probably should) exclude the faint of heart.",Apocalypto

Yes, I think we all knew how it would end for Jaguar Paw, but hey, not every movie needs constant plot changes to keep us on our feet. I also saw remarks about overdoing the gore. Not sure I agree there. I counted two sacrifices with the hearts ripped out. My wife pointed out the heads rolling down the stairs, but I seriously did not think r.

669,ewporter,Probably one of the ten best movies of the year,9,9 December 2006,"Apocalypto is probably one of the ten best movies of the year, a compelling action movie with not only adrenaline, but also brains and heart. Its portrayal of the Mayan culture -- including its strange dress, hair styles, costumes, tattoos, body piercing, and decorative scars, as well as its industry, class system, cities, warfare, weapons, myth, and religion -- provide a bizarre and fascinating anthropological backdrop for what is, at its heart, a solid, thrilling, fast paced old fashioned struggle between good guys and bad guys. The movie does have a lot of violence. But the violence is woven into a story with characters we care about. It is a realistic part of the culture being described. And it is not shown in a hyper gruesome manner, as is much of movie violence today. Thus, I found it much less offensive than many reviews had led me to believe I would. Unlike in some movies, I found the subtitles in Apocalypto so easy to read that most of time I forgot I was reading them. If anything the strange language only adds to the tone of exotic strangeness that pervades this unusually good and thrilling movie.",Apocalypto
670,krazyjovix,Wow.......Hats off to Mel Gibson & his Crew!!!! (Contains Spoiler),9,8 December 2006,"I just came from the theater watching this film. I thought it was very good. There are lot of confusions going around Apocalypto thread. Firstly, the whole movie is about the main character and him getting together with his wife. The movie is based on Mayan culture, however, it is just the essence of the movie. Some people also complain about too much chasing going on in the film and needs to be cut short. I did not think at all. It was very good and the camera did not shake too much and there were breath taking scene's. The movie is long however it did not bored me at all. The beginning of the movie was excellent where it starts of chasing a pig. Another thing I liked is when the village gets captured, Mel Gibson did not focus too much on rape scenes. Usually the directors go too much into those scenes and make it vulgar or think portraying it makes the movie more strong. This was excellent and the amount of violence you see in the movie is great as well.When you compare the violence, it is nothing. Yea there is blood, but it is nothing compare to Saving Private Ryan. There is no movie I saw that comes close to SPR. If you seen SPR or any other movie you think has more bloods and guts, you won't close your eyes at all. It all depends on your age wise and the amount of bloody movies you have watched in your life. As far as the sadness goes, I think Passion of The Crist had more tear jerking. This movie is a great adventure like movie where its about the main character and how he getting back to the family.I would recommend everyone to go watch it. Its a great film. It is in Mayan language and you watch it through subtitle. It will not bore you and the subtitle goes slow with words. The action scenes are very good and I like the fact Mel Gibson did not use very much CGI affects, sort of like Matrix or Crouching Tiger and made it look very original. I wanted the movie to go little bit more, but like I said, its all about the main character getting back to his family. So make yourself free today and get your big butt to the theater and watch it with a big giant soda of Pepsi. Oh, somehow the freaking theater screen looked small. I wonder if its available on IMAX type screen. I might watch this again if I find out some other theater screen is bigger than what I saw. Other than that, I am definitely and anxiously waiting for the DVD to release with special edition versions.",Apocalypto
671,suephx,Difficult for Mel to top this one,10,6 December 2006,"I saw APOCALYPTO last week at a screening in Tempe, AZ.Mel Gibson proves, once again, that he truly knows how to make a compelling motion picture.Please don't let the subtitles keep you from seeing this film.The pace is unrelenting - the visuals are staggering. The story works and Rudy Youngblood's performance is flawless. Dean Semler's camera provides breathtaking footage.I highly recommend APOCALYPTO - but be forewarned - the graphic violence and blood did make me turn away more than once.For this reason only - I think the movie might appeal to men more than to most women.",Apocalypto
672,dogaroomom,breathtakingly and bloody,7,11 December 2006,"It falters in a few places with some cheesy things that the audience laughs at (when laughter is not called for in the movie). Maybe it had to do with translation but I found some things just hard to swallow. I can't say more than that without spoilers. That being said, if you can get past them and the gore, this is a really good movie. It shows just how horrific humans can be to each other. Mel Gibson is a master at telling a story whether you agree with him or not. He took unknown actors and non-actors and put them in a place that is unforgiving of mistakes. Everyone in the film from Rudy Youngblood to the boy who plays his son, they all rise to the occasion.",Apocalypto
673,rcragun,gratuitous violence + ridiculously implausible storyline = bad movie,2,3 September 2007,"After Mel Gibson's ""The Massacre of the Jew"" came out I heard claims that he was a sadist masquerading as a screenwriter. Since I didn't take Massacre of the Jew seriously (it is, after all, the story of the killing of an alleged god - a myth like any Greek or Roman one), I didn't think Gibson really could be a sadist. Then I saw Apocalypto and realized the shoe fits - Gibson is a sadist.Apocalypto is the story of the ravaging of a small community of Native Americans by a larger community with the intent of appeasing the gods who have caused a plague in the land. One of those Native Americans escapes and takes a little vengeance, saving his wife and children in the process.Returning to the sadist idea for a minute, I think Apocalypto is a metaphor for Mel Gibson's struggle with sadism - he is sacrificing people, talent, and money to a ridiculous god - his thirst to see people suffer. In that sense, I truly hope that Apocalypto is Gibson's crowning achievement and he can move on to make movies with good stories.So, why do I hate this movie so? While it may have been the case that stuff like what is depicted in this movie happened (and, unfortunately, may continue to happen in parts of the world), I see no reason to glorify it. A band of slave hunters enters a village and massacres the people, taking all the fit ones to sale in the nearby city. In the process all of the slave hunters are depicted as evil, while all the villagers are good (typical black/white thinking, which is simplistic and naive). What's more, the main plot about the hero escaping to save his wife gets ridiculous beyond ridiculous when she gives birth in a flooding sinkhole with her 2 year-old son on her shoulders and catches the newborn baby with one hand while up to her neck in water. I kid you not.In short, gratuitous violence + ridiculously implausible storyline = bad movie. I actually began laughing 2/3 of the way through and couldn't stop it was so stupid. Gibson needs to satiate his sadism and get on with his life.",Apocalypto

Howevah...And man, it's weird! This VIDEO bore not the slightest resemblance to Passion or Braveheart in terms of (formerly) beautiful cinematography and good direction. Say what you want about Mel's disposition for portraying violence, he's a good director. And then there's this movie. Bizarre editing, schizoid story, wacky 'home-video' cinematography - I saw Dean Semler's name in the credits, but - am I missing something here? Thankfully, the cast, especially Youngblood and Trujillo, rocks, and makes the strangeness well worth watching.I need a beer.",Apocalypto
675,edbarbar,Includes Spoiling analysis,6,10 December 2006,"We've heard a lot about Mel Gibson's passion for violence, and this movie doesn't disappoint in that area. I view Mr. Gibson's fascination with violence as a way to probe the idea ""if your convictions can't withstand extreme physical pain, emotional pain, and fear, then they aren't significant convictions."" You will see a lot of that kind of thing in this movie.This movie also focuses on the use of brutality to control the masses. We have the priest knowing the eclipse will end, thereby coming up with words to appease the fearful masses. The arrival of Europeans (bringing along Christianity, of course), seems like a boon to the inhabitants, even though the hero does not embrace their presence.The violence has several phases. At the outset violence is used as a part of survival, by way of hunting animals. From there the hunters are hunted themselves. Finally, the hunted flips the tables and becomes the hunter. By the time the hunted becomes the hunter, everyone is so saturated it almost becomes comical, even as people die.Outside of that, the movie has a uniting message. The good villagers express many sentiments you might imagine in the modern friendships and relationships, including frat-boy pranks, and an imposing mother in law.Remaining stuff may spoil some cheesy gimmicks.There is a bunch of cheesy stuff, that doesn't hold up to much thought, and then some out and out silly things, including a rock left by the bad guys saves two lives, a ridiculous birth, and the continued belief that people haven't done the goes over the waterfall thing enough times or well enough or who knows what.",Apocalypto
676,acl06,Most thought-provoking movie I've ever seen,9,9 December 2006,"First off, the movie is a masterpiece. Accurate portrayal of a primitive but amazing society and the values that they had. It's absolutely break-taking scenery and direction by Mel Gibson. The movie may start slow but escalates quickly and ends on a note that makes you ponder the cultural differences of the medieval world. One theme that maybe subtle but is without a doubt intriguing is the evolution and progression of society as we know it. Throughout the entire movie it is virtually impossible for you to think of anything other than what is going on in the film. It grabs you and does now let you go through the entire ride. Also, it has such powerful cinematography and once its over leaves you imagining what happens next. I Love It! There has to be a sequel! The final scene is so well done and I think it is one of the best, if not the best, closing scenes in the history of film!!!",Apocalypto
677,thafreaker,One of the Best so Far,10,8 December 2006,"Directed by Mel Gibson, the follow up to ""Passion of the Christ"". Tells the story about the Mayans, during their last days before the Spanish conquistadors arrive. It focus on a village where a young warrior who, with his fellow friends and family have been captured by the Mayan ruler and are going to be presented to the gods as human scarifies. He must now find a way to escape and save the ones that he loves.It was a pretty good movie; it's made completely in the Mayan dialect (language). So there are subtitles all thru the movie. This is good because it makes you pay attention to the entire movie. If you have a chance this weekend I suggest that you give this movie a chance. It is a 2hr and 30min but its worth. It is rated R for some brutal scenes, and partial nudity. If you remember Passion, how bloody some scenes where expect the same for this one and even more.Im out as always,Wagner",Apocalypto

679,perseus9,Welcome to Mel's World,1,22 December 2006,"Well, here is a wonderful example of the arrogance of Mel Gibson. Using the final stages of the Mayan empire as a backdrop for another one of his tales of Christain salvation, he manages to use forced rape, mass executions, and as much sick violence as possible to portray those non-Christians as blood thirsty savages. Who cares if there is not one bit of fact to back up this story line? In fact, the only thing real about the movie is the use of ancient languages. That and the sumptuous setting and filming make you feel like you have entered a historically accurate world. But good ole Mel, crafty lil fellow that he is, has simply duped the viewer into getting a good dose of massive blood and guts and savage reality. Mass executions? Sorry - those never happened in the Maya lands, but they sure help drive home the point that those heathen were soulless savages. But disgusting, cruel violence sells movies these days, judging by the many folks who liked this movie.And what of Mel's wonderful Christian visitors? They didn't bring guns, distilled alcohol, and diseases. No mention of those minor items, just the good word and brotherly love, Mel style. Oh, what a perfect world Mel lives in.Too bad Mel couldn't have been a bit more accurate and balanced in his story telling - this could have been fantastic.",Apocalypto
680,wbkezw1,This film is simply without merit,4,20 August 2007,"I just can't find much to recommend about this movie. The plot is deplorably weak and predictable. Our hero is abducted, along with others, from his village in Mexico, and forced to march to another village, where he eventually escapes. Chased by his captors, he survives a series of contrived situations, manages to outwit and kill his pursuers one at a time, and finally arrives home just in time to save his wife and children. The first half of this two-plus hour film is taken up with the forced march, and is a real yawner. Once at their destination, there are some gruesome scenes of sacrifices, which at least arouse the viewer for the second half. Most chases in movies these days involve high-speed automobiles. This one involves men running through the jungle. Other than that, it's still just an hour long chase with no crumpled metal.The movie ends with a shot of Europeans and their ships arriving on the shore, and one can only pray that Gibson and company are not setting us up for a sequel.",Apocalypto
681,kvsmm,Characters - Maybe ? a spoiler,10,5 August 2007,"I never get to see a lot of movies until they come out on DVD, so this is a little late.I love history, and I think a lot of movies are guilty of making movies that are factually correct, but ignore the realities of daily life.I loved the 'story' of the family, and of the fathers burning need to help his wife and child. I think we forget that love has always existed, family has always been precious, and that we share much more with our distant ancestors than we know.Like the couple with fertility issues. The Bible speaks of couples who were 'barren', and I have no doubt that it was an issue in most civilizations. (Anyone remember Henry the 8th and his need for a male heir?)That was one of the things that made the people real, including being willing to do anything to correct the problem.The end was great. The two enemies lost the need to fight each other when they saw what was coming. Wonder what would have happens if those 'illegal aliens', the Europeans, had been turned back on that very day? Makes you think! As usual, Mel Gibson hit a home run. Makes me wonder how many negative comments from the Hollywood elite are just plain jealousy.",Apocalypto

Very well done and the music goes along perfectly with the culture and the events that take place. Very realistic for the most part, though some of it makes you question whether or not it is really do-able, but overall its very believable. It is not appropriate for families though, don't take your kids--not only are there scary parts, it is also extremely graphic at some parts-people getting their heads chopped off and their hearts ripped out at other times.",Apocalypto

This one was amazing as well. I watched it in the cinema but the positive impressions on me made all the plot and how strictly everything was connected. This movie last about two hours, but I wasn't bored at all. It past so quickly that I could watch another 30 minutes of it. Moreover I wasn't expecting the end when lights turn on and final inscription, or whatever English call it, appeared. I recommend this movie for everybody but kids. There is much blood and killing so it's just a subject for adults. I was expecting only some more about the Mayes so that's why I give the mark 9 for 10.",Apocalypto

685,smichae-1,Awesome movie,10,8 December 2006,"Well, about the only thing that I can think to say is that I guess that as long as Mel continues to make movies like Apocalypto, The Passions of Christ, Braveheart, etc., I guess that he can get away with a screw up like the traffic incident earlier this year without excessive damage to his brilliant career. This movie will undoubtedly receive multiple Academy nominations.....Producer, Director, Film.....make up... set and possibly BEST Actor. Almost overnight, Gibson, who wrote, directed, and produced this film, has created a new, previously unknown, star, Rudy Youngblood. Youngblood rides the crest of Gibson's paramount effort and gives what may be THE performance of his life. While Hollywood's genuine quality offerings, this fall have been sparse, I am certain that my reverence of this movie is not a reaction or by-product of the balance of the markets under performance but conversely, would be a standout in any years crop. I don't think that I can say much more about this movie without spoiling it for others other than to say GO SEE IT, IT IS GREAT!!!",Apocalypto
686,andrewpifer,"Thoughts, No Spoilers",10,30 December 2006,"Loved this movie. Went in sort of expecting Braveheart 2, and as far as bloodletting went, wasn't horribly surprised. What did surprise me was the amount of credibility the writing held, the amount of suspense that built and built to bursting, and the depth of feeling i had for the main characters, and for these people whose lives were at stake. i was held in sway from the first moments of the film, and within minutes did not care that i had to read the subtitles, it held for me the same captivation that the passion of the Christ held. i'm not religious, at least not anything specific (big believer in karma). but the realism evident in the languages that are foreign to my ears (latin Greek and Aramaic in passion, the Mayan language in Apocalypto) adds to the believability and power of the film. Go see this, and the cinematography alone will blow your mind. But so will the story. Worth my nine bucks.",Apocalypto

Anyway, I was surprised to find that this film was simply an action-adventure (albeit an amazingly well-produced and beautifully-filmed action-adventure) as opposed to a deep, mystical and revelatory experience with religious overtones. Given the name (Apocalypto) and the featured subjects (the Mayans, who figure so prominently in esoteric thought and New Age mysticism), I expected something completely different. A lot of us seem to be stretching our necks out pretty far to find an underlying theme examining the breakdown and decline of a civilization. Who says that the Mayan civilization only began to engage in human sacrifice as their end began to draw near? I think it is probably more likely that this had been an ongoing part of their spiritual life throughout their history. What shocks and appalls 21st-century audiences could well have been the norm for this culture. Also, I think that most everyone here is greatly overstating the violence and gore factor, I mean, has anyone watched Kill Bill lately...or Reservoir Dogs...or Saving Private Ryan? That being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed this film and it is truly a treasure in this age when the vast majority of our movies are comprised of unnecessary remakes.",Apocalypto

And no, I am not Jewish and would not boycott this film and be as ignorant as Mel was. I would appear to be just as prejudice as him. I went with an open mind and really enjoyed it. The intensity, gore, script, cinematography and music were all excellent. This to me, is his best film yet as a Director. Understand, this is an opinion and only an opinion.

I hate any movie that makes me read subtitles that are in white over white or light scenes that block out the sentences. I had to assume a lot of lines because I couldn't read the subtitles. I have seen several movies like this and I can never understand how the director's and producer's don't figure this out. Well this is one of those movies.If you want to go to the movie Theatre to read a movie then this will be perfect for you. If you want action, this movie has a lot of it. But it's predictable and quite frankly it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's extremely hard to understand why the action in this movie is happening. The story line is confusing. Different characters are put in situations that don't make sense. Characters live and die with no reconciliation in the script. There's no clear reason why one thing is happening in a certain way and there are a lot of open questions in the end.I found the movie to be totally a mess. It was almost like someone threw a lot of old lure South American jungle stories together and tried to make a movie out of it and tried to throw in a religious/spiritualistic concept to it.Thumbs down to this one!",Apocalypto
690,kruttikagarwal,return of the mondo,6,8 December 2006,"What strikes me most about this movie is the shear bravery of Mel Gibson to even think of this story telling to be a commercial Hollywood movie. The barbarism and rawness of ancient civilization showed might not as gory as late 70s Italian mondo films but definitely it has the will and purity of ancient mayan culture. Mel Gibson is not only brave but an awesome director to wrap this gory package in a pretty okay story line.I personally didn't find this movie an absolute mega hit or a piece of art but definitely it deserves an audience for the bravery shown by the Mel Gibson.I would not go in too much details of the story cos its very weak and nothing novel. I can sum it up by saying Apocalypto is result of a dream Mel Gibson had in which he saw Ruggero Deodato (director of cannibal holocaust) remaking Braveheart.I am personally a huge fan of mondo movies so I kinda appreciated this effort to bring the realism of ancient existence to audience in such a grand way.

You have to have a really strong stomach to stomach this inaccurate mess from Mel Gibson. It reminded me of his silly blue faces in Braveheart, much too late a period for the blue of the Pict warriors.I do and did appreciate the artistic direction, all that money that was spent must have gone for the terrific set of the ancient Mayan city because they didn't spend it on the actors and jungle. The acting was adequate from no names and certainly that wasn't a detractor. I've seen worse acting from Tom Cruise. An ambitious project all in Mayan, the subtitles weren't a detractor either.It's really a simple story, Family values conquers all, an exciting chase, run for your life similar to any chase be it the Fugitive or Apocolypto. So much was terribly improbable it asks the viewers to accept a lot. There were obvious metaphors to todays jaded world, and also to Nero's Rome. (Mel must have watched Fellini's Satyricon a few times in order to film the ancient city scene.)

This was not the case. However, the movie poses a very unique and interesting perspective on Mayan tribes and way of existence. The movie is action packed, gory, and at most cinematographically exciting, and this will certainly draw in the crowds. The movie was thought provoking, interesting and unique in the depictions of the way of life these people lead.

I was most surprised how the director's vision was NOT what I expected it to be: no preaching but rather a wonderfully told parable.For those of you who love reoccurring themes and symbols, this is a must see.

Mel Gibson is starting to have signature scenes and definitely signature ways to kill people off! Seems to me he's got a penchant for killing off meaningful characters' by having their throats slit to create emotional impact, and people's organs yanked out while they're still alive (think Braveheart). I don't think the movie is meant to reflect historic accuracy of any kind - but i do think it's meant to comment on how civilization cannibalizes others for resources driven by greed, and ""social progress"". It's a commentary on evolution and revolution. It's a great story though, and I think the main character of the movie must have had to run more than 100KM throughout the movie!

But when the villagers are attacked and then taken away to the Mayan world, there seems to be brutality and nothing but - I mean, how many rapes and guttings and beheadings do we really have to be subjecting to? Certainly it was a tough world then, but the story suffers as a result.

The action scenes were often filmed in dark jungle and you couldn't tell who was killing whom.The human sacrifice scenes and killing and selling of hostages were brutal,graphic and not very interesting to myself and those that saw the film. Parts of it(the escape by the ""hero"" seem to be plagiarized and copied from a film with Cornell Wilde in Africa made probably in the 60's and was more interesting and realistic.I'd forgotten the name, but it described how a group of white explorers were captured and tortured by some natives in the late 1800's,then the escape by the ""good guy.The scenery was different but the end results were somewhat similar.Hero lives, bad guys chasing him are killed, even though the odds were decidedly against him. Apocalypto had a wife and child as an aside that the ""hero"" saved at the end, and here, 2 of the ""bad guys"" stopped running after the ""good guy"" when they reached a beach and saw Spanish explorers coming toward land with their boats at anchor.-The end of the native civilization is upon them!",Apocalypto

Even if it did the Mayan people have not bad-mouthed this film for this reason so why are you? It is not Mayans who are the violent ones in this film, but it is the Aztecs, who were a violent people that made thousands of human sacrifices in the manner shown in the film. Also to those who claim that this film is overly bloody, that is incorrect as well.

And this totally works for me and in that way Gibson deserves respect. I mean he could go on making some romantic movies including some action bang bang good cops bad guys and stuff..and serve that unpleasant yet paralyzed viewers around the world and make huge money. But well he does spend a lot and make kind of movies that make the viewers see some new stuff.Passion of the Christ was a pretty violent movie but the point was not that in my opinion. The movie was using that ""violence element"" to force the person watching to consider how violent man can be when he wants (due to his needs)Well this movie is also pretty violent and i wouldn't let my kid to watch it if i had one. But to you all grown ups you should watch this movie again and again. I don't think that all those people who complain are disturbed with the blood. If so they should keep it away from that saw stuff or hostel or blah blah...This movie is disturbing not gory. You see a billion dead human bodies around without their heads and hearts sacrificed for no reason. This is not shown to you for sadistic reasons and you feel that during the movie. The nice blend of humor,love,revenge,different civilizations Great visual contacts with the viewer, amazing faces, stunning performances makes this movie unique for despite not being my type of stuff. i do think that you should give this movie a chance even though you're not a fan of Gibson or historical stuff or Maya's.Lets just confess that Gibson is a talented man and he keeps making better and better stuff by time.",Apocalypto

And what an interesting tour through a Mayan city through the eyes of the captive Jaguar Paw -- especially as he figures out what his captors intend to do with him. In my book, this film certainly has the ""visit ancient Rome"" film Gladiator beat -- there's more of a coherent story to this one. Most of the actors are new to American audiences, but all gave excellent performances, especially Rudy Youngblood as Jaguar Paw. I would certainly recommend this film -- except for those who are squeamish. No question that this is a bloody film, although in my opinion, the gore fits the story being told. Battle scenes and gory sacrifices abound, but they are germane to the narrative. I didn't find the language to be a problem at all -- you could probably understand the story perfectly well even if you didn't read the subtitles. I can't believe this concoction worked as well as it did, but it was Gibson's vehicle, so you have to give the man credit for sticking to his guns and doing a fabulous job.",Apocalypto

Technically speaking, (cinematography, editing, sound fx, score), this film is a present day masterpiece. Gibson truly takes you into his world, makes you care/empathize with the hero and his plight, pushes and pulls you like you're on a daunting roller-coaster ride. The performances (none of which are Hollywood trained actors, thankfully) are all solid, authentic and believable, especially the lead character, ""Jaguar Paw.""

703,keithtedder,Wow! Wow! and Wow!,10,10 June 2013,"I just saw this movie again for the sixth or seventh time, and I still cannot find a single flaw in this movie! Whether you like Mel Gibson or not, he knows how to direct a movie! Without going into it to much, I'm sure most people by now know its about the last era of the Mayan culture. Every scene is beautifully shot. All the actors are very believable, and what brutal violence that occurs seems to be warranted to keep the story moving along. The final 30 to 40 minutes is the best anticipated, edge of your seat, emotional, experience you ""should"" have watching a movie! I love movies from all genres, and have for 35 plus years. Apocalypto is now,and forever in my top ten!",Apocalypto

It may have historical inaccuracies but that's because it is meant to entertain you and not lull you.There is no such thing as an accurate historical account, so to all the history aficionados out there, you are merely adhering to one perspective of what happened, Mel Gibson gives you another.Even still, according to historian Mayans did make human sacrifices so please ignore those that say that they did not.",Apocalypto
705,petercrompton,Ending not too flash,7,3 July 2007,"That pretty much sums up the film. The ending isn't very well conceived. But the 2 hours before it are exhilarating and a great chase film.Many have missed the point that it is an action film and nit picked Gibson after his comments last year. Its about stereotype, your average cinema viewer knows there were sacrifices in the mayan civilisation, and thus this sets up a thrilling plot. There isn't much discussion on how or why in the film but that is because it maintains jaguar paws view the entire time. Jared Diamands view on the collapse of these empires has been controversial as well and it is easy to see it is a testy subject, but if an American film maker were to make a film on ""bloody mary"" and have gratuitous violence there would be no mistake that English folk would not get angry. i think the lesson learnt is don't make an historical film on smaller civilisations if you are a public racist. Ridley Scott can make any crap picture about rome or the crusades and make it as inaccurate as he wants and no one cares.i liked it, leave mel alone and see an action picture that actually delivers",Apocalypto
706,deniz-glass,Fantastic surprise!,9,10 December 2011,"Unfortunately I never went to the cinema to see this film and I wish I did! I hired the movie out without checking any trailers or reviews of the film and it blew me away! Whatever feelings people have about Gibson this guy can make films there is no doubting that.I have never sat through a subtitles in my life and yet this film not only had me sitting but also forgetting time altogether.To get a crew of unknowns together, tell'em to speak in a made up language and then create a masterpiece (yeah I said it!) is truly incredible.It's a top 5 movie for me. Don't ever stop directing films Mel!!",Apocalypto
707,sekihos,The best movie ever and ever!!!,10,30 November 2018,"Apocalypto is still one of the most underrated movies to this day, IMHO. If any other director had done it, it would have instantly been declared a masterpiece. But, because it was Mel Gibson, it hardly got any recognition at all, let alone the accolades it deserved.
This movie is The No.1",Apocalypto
708,pieopah-1,An Indian Fairytale for Adults,5,31 January 2007,"If you have liked Troy and Day After Tomorrow, you may like this movie too. Troy had heroism and good battle scenes, but lacked depth and varied from legend here and there. DAT was fun to watch, but needed you to throw away your brain. Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is similar in a way.There are lot of things done well in the movie, which elevate it from from usual blockbusters of the season. Settings are exotic, casts are all new, acting is excellent, visuals perfect and score and sounds stylish - and more important - not intrusive. The use of native language is a really nice touch and adds to an atmosphere.For an audience without any expectations the film should work pretty well as an action/romance flick with some violence.Those unlucky who expecting more would be disappointed. Leaving out a bit shallow plot (was OK for me), movie was incorrectly promoted, promising to experience fall of Maya civilization. Everyone hoping for an insight into a culture of great civilization should be prepared to relax more than usually.The movie is full of historical missteps, some of them made to relate to story and characters, some of them just due to creator's ignorance. Athrough I'm not history biased, and usually do not complain about it, much of the society facts, characters' relationships, family model and more just do not fit into the time-line and greatly reduce immersion in film.What the film feels like, is a glibness attempt to reuse successful scheme used in previous Mel Gibsons' projects. But knowing that this time it is much simpler movie, they needed something to cover up and attract wider audience -thus all that majestic topics, including promo tile and tag lines.What is really needed to enjoy the movie, is just approach it as another fantasy set in fictional time and space. Forget about Mayan, forget about declining civilization, and forget anything you will have learned at the time you leave the cinema.",Apocalypto
709,ahj2b,"The film is about Jaguar Paw. His village is ransacked by the evil Mayan conquerors. He is captured to be sacrificed. Blah, blah, blah. The summary is not important at all.",10,26 May 2007,"If you go in expecting a history lesson, you will be gravely disappointed. However, if you go in expecting mindless entertainment you should be thoroughly satisfied. This is definitely Mel Gibson's best film. I saw that someone was calling it a work of art. Not at all so. I repeat, if you want art look elsewhere. This film is an action/adventure that is certainly riveting, but there are definitely some laughable scenes (the little girl with the ""laughing disease"" is hysterically bad) but they only make the rest of the film easier to enjoy and easier to not take too seriously. Overall, I highly recommend it. Even for the pansies who usually get scared off by subtitles. It is not a dialogue driven narrative at all. In fact, the often humorously bad subtitle ""translations"" only make the movie more enjoyable. Great entertainment.",Apocalypto
710,shanawaz_82,Gibson's finest,10,19 May 2007,"This was by far, hands down the best movie Mel Gibson has made. After 'Passion of Christ' I was expecting another masterpiece, but Apocalypto has taken Mel Gibson even further towards one of the best film makers of our time. He is making one master piece after another and raising the bar for film makers world wide. The film will not let you leave your seat and will make you watch each frame from start to finish. The acting of all characters was flawless and so natural that you can actually feel fear, hate, and sorrow through their eyes. The locations and sets showed the detailed hard work gone behind each scene. All in all I think the movie was flawless and probably one of the finest films ever made. Story telling at its finest. 10/10",Apocalypto

It grabs you by the nuts and never lets go. A furious pace, outstanding performances, wonderful cinematography.There are critics of this movie who will use irrelevant historical inaccuracies to belittle it, as if their own favorite movies can be published in history journals.I have seen this movie over 5 times and I never get tired of it - it's that good.

He proved me wrong last night. APOCALYPTO is the best movie I have seen in about two years. In fact, it is unlike any other type of movie I have ever seen. Therefore, it really is hard movie to explain. It didn't feel like a movie, it felt like an adventure.The acting was surprisingly good. The sets were beautiful; the Mayan city was amazing. The cinematography was spectaculars. The story flowed very well and the script was awesome. (Also it's not as violent as I thought it would be - don't let people fool you.)",Apocalypto

I'll just say it's more of a 'guy' movie than expected. I think if you liked movies like brave heart and gladiator, you'll also like this movie... don't let the subtitle thing scare you... once they get to the bulk of the movie, there isn't much talking.. plus, it makes it more authentic... the story line is touching, the action is great, the acting (from non-actors) was the most amazing part.. all of them acted so well.. you would think they were all veterans... the main actor deserves some type of award... he said more with a stare or look than using a monologue... people should really check out this movie... forget the Mel Gibson controversy... that shouldn't affect your opinion of this movie... you should catch it for the great acting, fantastic story, realism..",Apocalypto
715,Normality,Great,8,27 December 2006,"First things first, I wasn't too convinced this movie would be worth watching, since I really didn't enjoy ""The Passion of Christ"". I think the mayan era is very interesting, and having the actors speak in actual ""mayan"" gives impressive credibility to each seen. I'd even say this movie is more like a heart-speeding documentary. I usually don't like heroes that much, but the young prince was engaging, meaning I ""wanted"" him to make it. Music-wise, the sounds are pretty repetitive but suit each seen (even though I would have preferred a bit more percussions). The only critic I find is why does the prince always run straight forward ? And how on earth do the ""badies"" manage to keep track of his direction while running ? Last thing : this movie is pretty violent ;)",Apocalypto
716,afcw1969,Loved the Forest Dwellers versus the blood-thirsty city dwellers,10,19 May 2007,"Hearing the film in a Native language other than English is a real treat and a film with all Natives is another, rather than a ""Western"" or even ""Eastern"" world film. More of these kinds of cultures films ought to be made based on real stories from their various histories. This film had a bit of similarity to The New World that featured Native Americans in a forest village. Apocalypto is the ultimate reality show or fear factor. It seems that The Mayans were similar in religious practices as were The Aztecs. They were highly advanced in their time calendars and astrology. They knew that eclipses of heavenly bodies were influential and indeed helped to change the course of events. It has a beautiful ending. I hope to join them in such paradise. Unfortunately The New World Order seen in both of these films has destroyed many such Shangri-las, meaning the forest cultures. The blood-thirsty warmongers are still bleeding the poor peaceful people who live on their own land and in their own forests.",Apocalypto

While the first time I saw it i thought it was acceptable/OK, the second time I found it absolutely boring and dull.The worst thing about Apocalypto is that it has no subject whatsoever. The whole movie can be summed up in the following sentence: ""They capture him, he escapes and runs back."" And that's it - a 2 hour and a half chase in the jungle. And it's quite a pity, because the movie could have truly been a masterpiece, regarding the complexity and the mystery around the Mayan civilization.The film should have focused more on the life in the major Mayan cities, perhaps with a little more drama, instead of presenting only 10 minutes of a Mayan city and two whole hours of violent hunting of simple tribesmen in the jungle.I can't say I totally disliked the movie, I found the scenery, the footages and the costumes to be very well realized, with a lot of attention to details. Also the music was very well done, it really gives you the chills during some scenes.Overall, it's a good action movie, OK at best, but definitely not a great movie.",Apocalypto
718,WJacksonville,Worth Checking Out At the Theater,9,10 December 2006,"Definitely worth checking out. It's not a deep message movie, it's just amazing to watch and a lot of good action to keep it going by really quickly.With the opening weekend being as good as it was, it shows that people want to see something different from what's been out there in a long time. It would be nice (but probably won't happen) if films like these woke Hollywood up to the fact that people in the U.S. do want to see something different rather than the same thing being pumped out week after week. Hopefully they won't decide to make copycats of this film, but be open to films that fall out of what they feel is the tried and true...remakes of films that were good enough in the original that they didn't need one. ""Wicker Man"" anyone????",Apocalypto
719,bugzlayer,Really Pretentious,5,15 January 2007,"Apocalypto It seemed like the greatest idea for a film that I had come across in the past years. Many of his other films had impressed me by their grandeur, and it seemed that he would once again deliver. The visuals were astonishing and the previews did not fail to stun me - it appeared that I could finally explore the decline of the Mayan empire on film, and in the original language as well...It promised so much, yet it was so poorly executed that its colourful facade left me indifferent and its morale wilted so rapidly after the first act that I couldn't wait for the sweet relief that was the ending.It was hard to look at the film objectively. I tried to not approach the film with Mel Gibson's controversial actions in mind, but the way that it was advertised as Mel Gibson's Apocalypto prevented me from doing so.Some argue that Gibson is an auteur. He is shocking, but he has is own style and his films are none the less beautiful. This applies to Apocalypto. The cinematography was breathtaking, the sets and costumes were very impressive. The whole feel of the movie was almost right. Because what lies behind this colourful facade appears wrong. Despite how good they look, the repetitive sequences of half naked men jumping over logs were unnecessary. The plot is also extremely simple. Decadent Mayans want to sacrifice a young hunter who must escape and save his wife an kid, both trapped in the bottom of a pit. The plot is so thin that it just seems like an weak excuse to show men getting decapitated after having their hearts torn out and. Yes, there is violence, and lots of it - another of Gibson's trademarks, is it not? Are we dealing with a metaphor? Yes, the decaying Mayan Empire could symbolise the U.S., or even the all of the 'Western' countries beating savagely on the underpriveledged and exploiting them. But how can this point be taken seriously when the film is so soul-less? Viewing the film only confirmed a dark expectation deep inside me: this movie is nothing other than a full-on multimillion dollar ego trip, a poor attempt to categorise Gibson as an auteur. Mel, you very well may be one, but try better next time... because your Apocalypto was really not that great.",Apocalypto
720,miteafrodite,Hysterical Historians,10,27 December 2006,"If only folks could set aside their soapbox on Mel's racist rant for just a moment and look at this film objectively...after all, he may be the director, but it WAS a collaborative effort of many many talented people (William Wallace may have been able to shoot fire bolts from his 'ars', but I doubt even Mel Gibson could pull a fully-completed blockbuster epic from his).That said, I have read soooo many tirades...um...reviews from historians and experts on Mayan culture just blasting Mel Gibson for his lack of authenticity, nitpicking on what he left out or got wrong so much that they overlook the things he may have actually got right. Yes, he blurred the line between Mayans, Toltecs, Aztecs, etc...and yes, he may have monkeyed with the historical timeline by a few centuries (okay...by millenia in some cases), but this film was not intended to give us an overall view of Mayan civilization from conception to demise anymore than ""Braveheart"" was an overall view of centuries of English/Scottish history. He took more than a few liberties with that film's historical content as well, but it was not meant to be History Channel fare...it was a Hollywood story of love, sacrifice, and inspiration. It was a visual feast, and even with its inaccuracies, is probably one of the most 'realistic' medieval films to date...and had some damned fine acting that could move you to both laughter and tears in the same scene. ""Apocalypto"" is just that. A story of love, sacrifice (um...I mean that figuratively), and inspiration on an epic scale....and did I mention a visual feast with damned fine acting? (The actors may be 'unknown' now, but they won't be for long!) I am so sick of reading reviews that point out Gibson's soooo-obvious racism towards indigenous peoples *************SPOILER ALERT********* by having ********* show up to supposedly save the savages from themselves. That is NOT what I got from that scene. The term 'apocalypto' is supposed to translate to 'new beginning' or 'revelation'...and Gibson says it himself in all his interviews that to have a new beginning to something you have to have an end to something else. I did not see, as some suggest, the portent of a mass (no pun intended) salvation of a bunch of noble savages, but rather, as the child prophet pointed out IN THE MOVIE (were you people even watching???), the end, the 'apocalypse', of their civilization. That no matter how things may have degenerated in their society, something WORSE was coming. Perhaps to be more accurate historically, the movie should have been about the Aztecs and not the Mayans, but I got the message just the same, the references to modern civilization's looming implosion/self-destruction. Historians may be disappointed by the cultural aspects the film left out, but the message in ""Apocalypto"" is not supposed to be how the Mayan culture prospered or how long it lasted, but how, like all other great and powerful civilizations (Europeans too), it eventually weakened and fell from within....and that has nothing to do with race. He could have made a film with the exact same message set in just about any ancient culture (even some more modern ones) that grew too big to support itself.Many of the experts that question the authenticity of Mel's Mayans even admit themselves that there is not much info beyond what took place in the recorded history of urban areas...so how can you say there weren't forest people who've never seen a Mayan city 'just 20 kilometers away' (when's the last time any of us walked 20 kilometers?)? I'm sure they'd be surprised at the cluelessness of people in this decade that don't know, even with cars and television, what lies 20 clicks from their doorstep (unobscured by giant trees).""Apocaplypto"" is a beautifully crafted film. Yes its violent, yes its gory, but that doesn't detract from the story it tells. And it doesn't make me believe ALL Mayans were bloodthirsty savages bent on slavery (which existed in many many cultures throughout history) and gratuitous human sacrifice (hey, as distasteful as you find it, you can't deny they practiced it, but at least they did it for what they thought was a good reason), or colors my perception of modern-day Mayans (modern-day Scandanavians don't throw trussed up victims into bogs to appease tree gods)...anymore than I think it glorifies or justifies the concept of colonialism. And just because every single actor in the film wasn't of pure Mayan descent with ancient Mayan physical characteristics doesn't mean that Mel Gibson, or anyone that appreciates this film, personally feels that Native Americans are 'interchangeable'. I, as an average moviegoer, personally find THAT insinuation offensive. Don't pay attention to the silly hype about racism, stereotyping, or Gibson's 'hidden agenda'. Appreciate this film for what it is. Like ""Braveheart"", its a beautiful yet realistic and gritty, exciting, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat 2-hour time trip with spectacular scenery and award winning performances...whether it wins any or not. Its not a history lesson or a documentary, folks...its a visually stunning Hollywood epic of love, sacrifice, and inspiration...with some damned fine acting (and directing).(Bottom line: I definitely got my $8 worth of entertainment. And I'd spend another $20 on the DVD.)",Apocalypto
721,ducky42378,A great movie! (A posting using correct English grammar and spelling),10,17 December 2006,"This movie is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is filled with wonderful cinematography, characters, actors, story lines, the list goes on. Although this movie is painfully accurate in some instances it was not meant to be a movie just about the ancient Mexican civilizations. This movie was meant to portray the strength that love builds between people. It was meant to show that for love this young man would do anything to get back to his wife and child. For love this man was willing to fight to the death to save his entire family and village. So that's it this movie is about LOVE and nothing else. Not everything that is about other civilizations is racist (which is a misnomer anyway).Once you can look past your own prejudice then you will be able to see clearly....movies are for entertainment.When you post a comment about a movie or its director it would probably be more powerful if you used correct English grammar, spelling and punctuation. It would be easier to understand and therefore get your point across much more clearly.",Apocalypto
722,Sixteenluckyhats,"Gibson butchers history, creates shallow blockbuster.",2,10 December 2006,"SPOILERS, LOTS AND LOTS OF SPOILERS.OK, first of all I must say this is an entertaining movie, if all you like is very well done violence and an epic chase scene that doesn't wear out it's welcome until it ends in a predictable manner (the pig was obvious foreshawdowing).However, if you actually care about plot, historical accuracy, and original characters like I do, this movie is not for you. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, around where all the prisoners are taken to the Mayan city, the plot completely falls apart. After this part nothing in the movie happens that isn't there purely for entertainment or dramatic effect. About the end, WHY IS CRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IN THIS MOVIE? The major Mayan civilization fell apart around 900 A.D., A GRAND HALF Millennium BEFORE HE ARRIVED IN America, it's obvious by the stereotypical beard and armor and the three ships that were clearly supposed to be the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria that this was supposed to be Columbus's first voyage, which didn't even land in Mexico, it landed in San Salvador. This complete butchering of history knocks this movie down a whole 3 points out of ten. I felt that all the character dialogue and behavior could have been taken out of any movie that had Native Americans in in in the last 20-30 years (do the translators even try to sound different?). Not all Native Americans lived the same way and even though both the Mayans and the other tribes featured in the movie lived near each other they probably didn't speak the same language or have such closely related wardrobes. Way to be authentic and creative Mel.In the end, while I appreciated the violence as much as any guy, this movie absolutely lacked any depth whatsoever. Apocalypto felt like Gibson just took Dances With Wolves and moved the setting to the end of the Mayan civilization, removed the plot, and let his special effects artists go wild in an apparently successful attempt at conning the American public into giving him another $300 million or so.",Apocalypto

Lots of violence though.. you've been warned. On one hand, it's your typical ""faith and love can overcome anything"" storyline, but I really loved peering into the Mayan world.

After reading so many good things, I was expecting Mel to actually pull this seemingly epic film off. What I was not expecting was to see not only one of this year's worst films, but one of the worst films in recent memory.The film that hung it's hat on being a look at the destruction of the mysterious Mayan civilization, doesn't even scratch the surface. Instead Mel, decides to spend most of the film following a cliché chase film plot. The movie begins with a long boring walk to an impressive recreation of the ancient city, only to top off with a lame chase. The film has several false leads and character flaws. The films characters are totally non engaging and believable. My biggest question was, why did Mel opt to use the ancient language of the Mayans, just to have them talk in modern day vernacular.In the end, this movie is all hype and no substance. Riding the wave of publicity from it's hate monger director. This film is a horrid mixture of Braveheart and The Passion. The biggest difference is that the characters are not engaging and sympathetic like Christ. Nor, is even on second of the action as amazing as that from Braveheart. The film is a total let down in all ways, and I am terribly disappointed in the amount of misleading reviews that will trick audiences into the theaters to support this disappointing film.",Apocalypto

731,ddennison-1,A Piece of Repugnant Trash to Watch Mostly in Fast-Forward,1,27 January 2007,"This movie is a monument to the depraved alcoholic, homophobic and anti-semitic mind of Mel Gibson. Combined with ""Passion of the Christ"", it's clear that his movies are nothing more than a vehicle to showcase long, unbelievably drawn out spectacles of violence, blood, brutality and barbarism. Gibson wouldn't be an alcoholic if he wasn't also disturbed otherwise, and these two films simply prove it, they lay his character bare.The temple scenes are indeed visually fascinating, but that's ALL that makes this movie interesting. And that's no great credit to Gibson, the actual temples themselves are the work of art -- he just reproduced them. It *is* interesting though, that no one else has tackled the subject of Mayan/Inca/Toltec/Aztec civilization.The first half of the movie is nothing but extremely tedious, desperately-in-need-of-editing scenes of people being dragged through the forest as captives. All the while staring at each other in some blank pointless stare that gets old very quickly.The ""script"" is vapid and shallow. OK, they've been captured. We get it. No need to show them for what seems to be eternity being dragged through one forest hazard after another.The last half of the movie is nothing but a bunch of stupid, boring and appallingly predictable chase-the-guy-through-the-forest scenes. That go on and on and on and on....There is almost nothing to this movie except the obvious theme of how Meso-Americans would capture other tribes and enslave and sacrifice them. But we know that. This movie simply films that idea for the purpose of creating a vehicle for blood and gore, without the slightest departure from pure superficiality. There is no in-depth exploration of the culture and why these supposed humans are doing this. The subject needed a great novel from an accomplished and talented writer. Instead we got a comic book written by a hack.",Apocalypto
732,Rajjpuut,Savagery beyond mere violence,10,10 March 2008,"""Apocalypto"" is a sensational action-packed and ultimately self-redeeming tour de force that keeps getting better and better as the show goes on. However, before piling up the praise, let me be critical of some details that made the movie less than absolutely perfect. Director Gibson had a big problem. The historical period he wished to treat was the time immediately following Columbus' expeditions into the new world.In Mexico at that time the Mayan Civilization had long been supplanted by the Aztecs and the remnants of the Mayans had reverted to the simple tribal cultures of previous centuries. The warrior-cultured Aztecs had basically stolen Mayan culture (mathematics, astronomy, agronomy, mining etc.) and raised it to an even more all-powerful and individual smothering nation-state. One thing, by the way, that may increase the viewer's understanding of the movie was that the Mayans as early as 800 A.D. and the Aztecs who replaced them had a far superior calendar to the European calendars. Their calendar was based upon a 52-year cycle in which the Earth was supposedly born and then ultimately dies out (hence the name Apocalypto)unless humanity and the high priesthood intervene. Anyway, Gibson who as in TPotC features English subtitles in Apocalypto had the problem of his actors communicating in two languages or even three (the wandering tribe)and settled on just having everything spoken in the Mayan dialect that supposedly the hero Jaguar Paw's tribe would have spoken. That tiny problem aside, the movie was outrageously powerful.""Apocalypto,"" like Gibson's previous hit ""The Passion of the Christ,"" was a historically based movie which takes violence to a new level. Indeed I would say that the naturalistic and utterly realistic violence of Apocalypto takes movie savagery to a level well beyond mere violence to that of factual incidence.In both cases as in the movie ""Braveheart,"" not an ounce of violence was gratuitous or outside the likely reality of the historical occasions. The main difference in The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto was that many, many more American and worldwide viewers are aware of the underlying story in TPotC than know even a single detail about the Aztec and Mayan civilizations. The scary thing is that a mere 500 years ago, people lived like that in the New World. The scarier thing is that in many parts of the world today, a different type of savagery (Darfur? Rawanda Afghanistan,Iraq) is as commonplace as it was then.The contrast between civilized people (civilized means citified if you'll look at your dictionary's etymology) and the natural tribal man's life was stark and critical of all civilizations including our own. The utter suspense of Apocalypto was a second-by-second roller coaster ride that's totally unforgettable. Gibson is a director of the first water and he's made a powerful movie that is a total viewing experience.",Apocalypto
733,kennyshernstein,Excellent movie!!!!,8,21 January 2007,"From the opening scenes I was transfixed on the screen , totally wrapped up in this truly mesmerizing movie. Gibson has created a piece of work here which pushes the boundaries of film making . The viewer from the beginning likes the main characters and is made to feel all their emotions through every scene of the movie by means of clever dialog and honest family values . I will not give anything away as that would definitely detract from your enjoyment of this movie . If you can , then see it before reading anything about it and I guarantee you will be swept along with the main character , Jaguar Paw ,for a wonderful cinematic experience . Thank you Mr. Gibson for this piece of work which breaks the mold for those run of the mill emotional dramas which usually pick up all the awards . My Oscar for film of the year goes to Mel Gibson and Apocalypto .",Apocalypto
734,RoboHoss,An excellent motion picture!,8,10 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is simply a well-crafted motion picture coupled with a truly engaging story. Though some scenes of violence were graphic I did not judge it to be on par with Gibson's previous features such as ""The Passion of the Christ"" or ""Braveheart"" - In fact, by today's horror genre standard, it struck me as positively tame. The cinematography (Dean Semler) was extremely vivid and absolutely gorgeous.I came away from ""Apocalypto"" with a very real sense that I had looked into the past and was given a practical taste of a different culture and way of life. In many ways, the film's story was universal and the physical expressiveness of the actors drew me in to such a degree that reading the sub-titles became a totally reflexive and autonomic function. This in-turn heightened the feeling of having an emotional rapport with many of the characters (especially the ""hero"", Jaguar Paw).",Apocalypto
735,red_juniorr,filled with symbolism Mel Gibson delivers an original and interesting film,9,14 February 2007,"Unlike the first review of this movie here, I believe Apocalypto contains a great deal of symbolism and messages. You just have to know a little bit of History to place the story into context: The end of the Mayan Civilization.Great cities were abandoned by then, population scattered.Governors and Kings became extremely corrupt and degenerate.Civil wars were constant and the craving for blood for the Gods was endless.The years of wise Mayan Scientists, Mathematicians,Philosophers and Astronomers were long gone.Mel Gibson manages to reflect that period of chaos and decay wonderfully.Mayans believed in cycles of life and the prophecies told them theirs was over.That is why the main character knows he has to start afresh in the end of the movie since the Mayan World changed for ever upon the arrival of the Spaniards from Europe. Additionally, make up, clothes, jewelry etc are fantastically accurate which makes this a unique film, the only one that shows the way the Mayas really were.And thank God Mel Gibson for not making another period movie using a dumb English accent!",Apocalypto
736,mk-10,"Nothing Special, Standard Mel",6,14 December 2006,"I figure ol' Mel dug out an old copy of ""Aztec"" or something and did a little rearranging and came up with this.As usual, it is not historically accurate. And you know all the end bits way before they happen. Was anyone surprised at how the the head baddie got his ? Or that Mel invented water birth ? Or that the Europeans would be landing ? Yes, it did keep moving along. And no, I did not thing the gore and violence were too much (seemed to be less bloody than 'Braveheart').I am glad I saw it at a discount matinée - I felt it was worth the cost, but probably would have felt cheated at a nighttime ($$$) showing. Not cheap, just want my money's worth.Worth seeing, but not worth seeing twice.",Apocalypto

Regardless of color, religion or education...this story's truths are undeniable. Love and hate are synonymous with humanity.During the movie I was left with a sense of ""Why do we humans feel it necessary to dominate and obliterate one another""? I laughed, feared and rejoiced with the characters.This film was a first for many of the actors, they did a wonderful job! I hope to see more, well researched ancient civilization films by Mr. Gibson.Good job Mel.",Apocalypto
738,adinas-2,Christianity promoting film?,1,20 October 2007,"If you ask me, the whole point of this movie was to show how barbarian the native Americans where and ""Thank god Christianity arrived to change them"". This is thrown in our faces when, towards the end of the movie, after seeing all the gruesome things the Native American are doing to each other, we suddenly see Spanish ships off the coast with boats filled with Cross bearing Europeans coming ashore. My immediate reaction was ""ah, Civilization!"" and I expect this is exactly what Christian promoting Gibson wanted the viewers to feel. Otherwise I found the movie a bit pointless. They capture him, he escapes, the end. Non of the characters seem to learn or evolve.",Apocalypto
739,typecase,Simply Breathtaking! One of the most amazing films I've ever seen,10,27 December 2006,"This movie left me breathless after I saw it. I can count on my hand the number of movies that have done that to me. It really shows how powerful a medium film can be. I didn't simply see this movie, I lived it! The movie wasn't perfect. It had a had a few plot points that were a bit unbelievable but the film is so immersing those missteps are easy to overlook. What makes this an even more impressive an achievement is that no one ever speaks English even once. Furthermore, the cast is made up of complete unknowns who are so amazing in their roles you never doubt for a moment the realism of every emotion. You also never once question any of the technical aspects of the film, which is perhaps a tribute to how good everything from the cinematography to the costumes and make-up is. This movie is a true achievement--a high point in modern cinema.",Apocalypto
740,lanowar-1,This movie is destined to be one of 'the greats'.,10,30 January 2007,"Before going to the movie I saw an interview with Mel Gibson in which he said for his movie Apocalypto he toned down the violence because, historically, it was much worse. For example they had four temples sacrificing humans, where the movie only had one.The story commences with a peaceful tribe living in harmony with each other in their forest lands. The audience is introduced to Jaguar Paw. This actor is destined for greatness - you will know why when you see the movie - his character is central to the power of the story and he is magnificent. Then there are the temple tribes who have a more sophisticated society with temples, crops and housing. As their crops fail, and their society decays they believe sacrificing humans to their God will turn their world around. Superstition is part of their culture and appears to be part of their downfall. Note the little girl with the plague -although she had only a minute in the film - she conveys to the audience how she suddenly grasps understanding of her enemy's weakness. From the moment the temple tribes capture the peaceful tribe the audience is thrown into a brutal and ancient world. Sure this frightening world was long long ago but the story is painted on the temple walls, and now translated to real life via the big screen movie Apocalypto. It's been said in extreme survival situations humans can awaken a reptilian part of the brain, and in this movie Mel Gibson depicts that the primeval and instinctive forces within was the only way to ensure life. It was a terrifying ride - but man -it was bloody brilliant. Don't miss it.",Apocalypto
741,schury62-1,The last bit's for a high score are missing!,7,24 January 2007,"Now I've been to see Apocalypto. (please have a look at the website, it's fabulous really don't know what to say but - Wuh! That much I will say. Don't go and watch it if you have bad nerves or are squeamish at all. I normally am, but I looked the other way when something like that happened! It's a though deal - that's for sure. When that's said, and it's the way it has to be, extremely well done. The acting is fabulous, and the scenery, costumes, make-up, effects - all is tip top. I will thought agree with another review of the film, when they say it dosen't deserve 6 stars (in Danish medias. Dorte and I agreed that 4 had to be it, and that's because the good Mr. Gibson tend to get stuck and dwell too much on the same things. Personllly, I think he had the same tendency in ""Braveheart (1995)"" that otherwise is a good film too. In that he just had the fighting scenes go on eternally, and you're just fed up in the end, and for my sake much of that could have been cut out. It's a bit the same here, but not only fighting scenes. You're taken to the climax and fall down with a bang, you sort of lacks the last bits and the afterplay - to stay with those metaphors! The Film is still in my system this morning. No doubt about the fact that it has had an very hight impact visually and with the sound track. There are some very powerful effects in use.It's just irritates me, that there are these historical i.e. inaccuracies. When you make a movie that without doubt has cost a small fortune to make, why not make the effort to get things right down in DETAILS. A lot of them are ""small stuff"", but things that to me is irritating to read about afterwards, and there's not reason for them, seen from the movie side of things - not in my opinion anyway. Just one example is smallpox that is mentioned in the film, and it didn't arrive until the 16th. century with the Spanish. They're also show coming there at the end of the film, and I was sitting there thinking that something was wrong .On the other hand I learned something on a key issue. I didn't think or thought that the Jaguar, can be black, but it can. I knew that the black panther actually is a leopard, (who still has it's spots). but the same can be true for the Jaguar - I've checked this morning. By the way our main character in the film is called ""Jaguar Paw"" (Rudy Youngblood). I also got wiser on the fact that it was actually more the Aztecs rather than the Maya that sacrificed people to the Sun God. But they did sacrifice prisoners the way it's shown. So two things mixed together. And why not do it right. The Mayan culture and history is so very interesting on it's own that there's no reason to change it.And a thing as to have a solar eclipse just before a full moon the same evening..how hard can it bee not to make mistakes like that - eclipses only come after a new moon! The Maya's had great astrological knowledge and when I was there we saw some fantastic examples of that, in the way they build their temples to make the sun hit special spots in certain time etc.",Apocalypto
742,lil_pink_lady1708,dreadful,1,12 March 2007,"I went to watch this film and found it absolutely awful! The gore and graphic violence in this film was just too much for me, it physically made me vomit. I feel that the film has no real outlined plot and strays from the pathetic so called plot that it does have. There is absolutely no closure towards the end of the film, in fact i feel that it has no end. It almost seems like they ran out of money to make an ending. I feel that the whole basis of the movie was to disgust the audience and to make anyone who could watch it fully or actually enjoyed it feel like a 'tougher' person. I feel that the only good thing about this film is that they did almost force the audience to sympathise with the characters. Being someone who highly dislikes others suffering, the film reduced me to tears. The gore is excessively overdone. I have also watched Passion of the Christ and feel that there was too much gore in that film also. Sometimes i think that maybe Mel Gibson wants to show the suffering of the characters in his films but i can't help myself from thinking that he might actually enjoy producing films which the audience can not stomach. This is a film i would never watch again or even think of watching again. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone and feel that it was a huge waste of my money and my time.",Apocalypto
743,awb03,"To all the Mel Gibson haters: Sorry, It's good!",8,15 December 2006,"The reviewers are trying to damn this movie with an untruthful and insincere mantra about its alleged excess of violence: ""brutally violent,"" ""over-the-top violence,"" ""unrelenting violence,"" ""ultraviolent,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes in the jungle,"" ""unpleasant, pointless, gruesome, and exploitative,"" ""pure, amoral sensationalism,"" ""blood and gore  so extreme that they provoke titters of ridicule,"" ""savage cruelty and sadistic barbarity,"" ""lunatic violence,"" ""feverish, mad violence."" You'd think from the reviews that you were going to see two hours of babies being fed through a wood chipper. One went as far as to claim that it made the Saw movies seem like Little Women or some such nonsense.It does no such thing. The Saw films were gratuitously and sadistically violent; they set out to make audiences squirm and blanch at their sick, nihilistic machinations.Apocalypto, on the other hand, is the typical, essentially optimistic Disney story of a happy Indian youth ripped savagely from his rain forest life by ruthless marauders, after which he has to escape and fight his way back to his land and people. That's it.The violence arises from the fact that these particular marauders are bloodthirsty Mayan warriors harvesting neighboring tribes for their human sacrifices. Even then, much of the violence is Shakespearean and takes place just off-camera. For instance, you see women being carried off in the rape-and-pillage scene and you hear their cries but you don't see them being raped and murdered. Battles are staged much as they were in Braveheart. And yes, there's a beating heart lifted from a sacrificed man's chest by a blood-streaked Mayan shaman, but moviegoers saw the same thing in Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; it got a PG rating and we read no critical hysterics about ""lunatic violence."" On the whole, you'll see as much blood and gore on the average CSI episode.It probably should have been titled Jaguar Paw's Great Adventure. The glimpses Gibson provides of Mayan civilization are jaw-dropping. You won't ever see a more convincing cinematic evocation of another time and place in such scope and meticulous detail. Every face seems to have a complete history as Jaguar Paw is marched through the Mayan city. A well-to-do Mayan woman does nothing more than look at the prisoners from her doorway but the story her face tells is voluminous.The last part of the movie is a rousing chase akin to The Naked Prey, and again, no more bloody and violent then the film it resembles.Let's be plain here. What really has the critics'--especially those of the Eastern Elite variety--panties in a twist is the director, Mel Gibson. He said some things that upset them, plus (and most unforgivably) he's an outspoken and conservative Christian, so they're going to practice any sort of mendacity that will keep people from buying tickets to his film.Don't buy the lies or you'll miss an amazing movie.",Apocalypto
744,utopia314,unforgettable...yes,9,5 January 2007,"You can count on Mel Gibson to give you a gripping movie experience. The recently much maligned director has again deviated from the normal Hollywood curve to produce something different and well worth watching. Apocalypto is a must-see in the theater adventure. There is blood, some gore, but casting that aside for the squeamish , there is an amazing two plus hours of real entertainment.

I don't get into the bull about purpose or absolute truth in movies..I mean they are movies for crying out loud and by definition they are not real...and so I was really able to enjoy myself with the suspense, great character development, and creative storyline. Rudy Youngblood did an excellent job as well as the rest of the cast. Mel Gibson's humor played in here and there in just the right places and yes, the scenes of the sacrifices were interesting. I do admit that I have a slight bias as a Chicana who is educated in Mexican History...which is why I was drawn to see it in the first place. But as someone who also loves to be entertained at the theater, this film had just the right tints of truth and fantasy to keep me thinking about it since I saw it two days ago. At this point, for me, what Mel Gibson said and what happened afterward with his profuse outpouring of apologies, is dust in the wind. He's a great filmmaker and as an avid moviegoer, that's enough for me to keep seeing his films on opening day.",Apocalypto

Most say that they do like this film or it was OK and then add things they didn't like about it.I personally loved it, and would not have made any changes to it, including subtitles, running time etc. One of my favourite scenes is the escape and chase back to the village. It is one of those films where you really feel involved. You want him to get revenge and you want him to get away, and those bad guys in the film really get to you. This is one of the few films I could watch more than once. I would describe it as a feel good film because it takes you through the motions and you want some sort of satisfaction at the end, which it delivers perfectly.",Apocalypto
747,alexestiu,fear - the sickness inside,9,9 January 2007,"I saw the movie, I agree it has many violence scenes, it's a movie not easy to watch at, for sure. But I take all of these as parts of a message, cause I take the movie as a message one. And the main theme of the movie, as I became aware of it, is the conquering of the own fears. Any civilization, as it reaches it's end, is more and more based on fear, fear of death, fear of suffering, of pain, of losing what's already been achieved. So is the Mayan civilization in the movie, and so is ours, the western one. If one had a deeper sight in the main elements that make our society work further, he would easily see that all of these are powered by fear, primal fear, fear of any kind of physical pain, fear of social disparagement, fear of insecurity of life..., fear of love and any other deeper feeling and thoughts. As the motto of the movie shows, destroying a civilization begins always from inside. So does destroying a human being as well... and it all starts with fear.For sure it's a movie worth seeing and thinking over. I sincerely congratulate Mel Gibson for his boldness, for putting his finger on the very soar spot of our whole western and modern being: fearing almost everything. If we don't fight this - the fear inside - than for nothing we fight ourselves and for nothing we consider ourselves educated, modern and independent. Fear has dwelled in us from the beginning of history and human times, and bearing it inside just only proves ourselves as being not at all further or different from what we call the barbarian or the savage people of the past. Maybe civilization has made some progress. But what about the human being? Conquering fear is just the first step.",Apocalypto

751,rrawling-2,A Mayan man tries to escape human sacrifice.,4,8 December 2006,"OK, so not only is this movie historically inaccurate, but it is also . The Maya were a very sophisticated people, not ""primitive"" and backward as portrayed by the movie. They were the Romans of mezo-America: magnificent art, architecture, religion, and education. A main theme in this movie is human sacrifice. The film portrays sarcifice as something negative, gruesome, and barabaric- none of which describe how human sacrifice really was to the Maya. To be sacrificed was an honor. In Mayan cosmogony, the Gods sacrificed themselves to create the fifth world: the world of the humans. For this, the Maya were indebted to the Gods and made sacrifices in return. In fact, the Maya didn't rip peoples hearts out as a sacrifice. More often, they would pull a rope with stingray spines in it through the tongue or phallus. They would let the blood drip onto paper inside a special bowl. After, the paper would be burned as an offering. The heart cutting out was more an Aztec and Tehuetehucan thing. In this ceremony, the heart was cut out and help up to the sun, still beating, as an offering to the sun god. The head was not cut off, as seen in the move; rather, the body eventually rolled down the temple steps, not thrown off. The Maya, Aztecs and Tehuetehucan belived the sun wouldn't rise if they didn't sacrifice. Also, they never painted people blue or sacrificed many people at once. It was more like once a day. Another mistake is the use of names like Jaguar Paw. The obsession with the Jaguar was an Olmec thing, which predated the Maya. Oh yeah, and the Maya wore clothes, not loin cloths. Yeah, this movie is so wrong, it makes me angry.",Apocalypto
752,cathalcom-1,blood death nonsense,1,21 March 2007,"visually excellent, but genuinely there is no story at all, simply a succession of gory acts of violence. and what bugged me the most (i write music) was how incredibly bad the soundtrack was. if you know your music, you don't need me to point this out, but just in case you don't know this, the entire soundtrack could have been compiled on a cheap midi-keyboard.i used to think Mel Gibson was kinda cool. now i really just think he's a moron. the plot's so silly that i can reproduce the entire content in bullet points: boar hunt, encounter with scared tribe, village storytelling, comedic village antics, village attack (very long and gory), transportation of villagers as slaves by the 'evil' other tribe, slave falls of cliff, arrival at big quarry, sacrifice to the gods (beheading), ridiculously sped-up solar eclipse to fit into the plot (?) line, saved by the solar eclipse, chance to escape, pursuit through the jungle for the rest of the whole movie. the pursuit is motivated by hero trying to save his wife who is drowning in a pit (altho he pauses at several points with the thousand yard stare, even tho he knows his wife's drowning), and 'just in the nick of time' arrival at the rain-filling well, to find that his wife has had several kids in the mean time who are floating around her, the whole group of which is then unexplainedly transported out of the well to safety, after which they walk off into the sunset. yes, it is that stupid.",Apocalypto

For the most part although I disagree with Mel Gibson's comments I don't hold it against his movie, so anyone who wants to dismiss my review as ""omg he just hates Mel Gibson"" should rethink that right now.Great movies like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction or even Pirates of the Caribean(sp) all share one quality, their immersive atmosphere. This atmosphere is the one thing I found missing in Apocalypto. Throughout the movie I never really felt compelled to care what happened to any of the characters. Honestly if every character in the entire movie died I probably wouldn't care. I never felt like I was part of their struggle. Like I had something to lose if they died.Aside from that aspect, and the gore looking pretty mediocre (there are parts where you can definitely tell it is fake, at least in my opinion) it's a decent movie I guess.Worth going to see if you have 2 1/2 hours to waste and like Mel Gibson's work.PS: Once again, I held nothing against this movie in terms of what the producer has said or made previously.

756,moviefanman3,Really entertaining film,9,18 December 2006,"Well, say what you want to about the man's verbal comments of late, thankfully his judgment and talent in producing and directing a film are still sound. Apocalypto was a refreshingly great film which serves to entertain the audience. It is based on a part of history that has previously been ignored by film making. Finally a film for the demographic of those people who have a bit of Mesoamerican heritage. The film is very well directed with beautiful cinematography. The actors put great passion in their roles which enders them to the audience. The costuming and sets are very well done . Historically the Mayan culture portrayed in the movie had long been on the wane at the time of the movie ( a historical event occurs in the film which dates the film) , and the Aztecs would have been the dominant culture,but the film still is superb considering that it is foremost a movie based on historical facts, and not a History Channel documentary. Great job Mel.",Apocalypto
757,livhampton,Young tribesman embarks upon a perilous journey to find his family,9,11 December 2006,"In my honest opinion as a viewer,Mel Gibson proves once again that he is a talented director.""Apocalyto"" stayed true to what it was meant to be-a historical epic.Yes it was violent,and though many people who do not care for graphic violence in movies may be turned off by the amount seen here,I did not mind it much at all.Every now and then a movie comes along that is filled with what may seem like over-the-top violence,yet it still conveys a clear and meaningful message.""Apocalypto"" is one of those movies.Personally,I still respect Mel Gibson as an actor and director,and even as a person despite his troubling remarks.",Apocalypto

Gibson's new heart-pounding thrill ride Apocalypto delivers all the gut-dropping violence that his aficionados crave, but leaves a perplexed aftertaste. Five minutes into the film there rings a unanimous sigh through the theater at the appearance of the subtitles. Gibson never falters with the accuracy of his film's dialects, nor does he with their body count. The first show of uncapped violence would leave the audience breathless, that is if it stopped. This bloodbath of bare skin and backless loin cloths continues for the next two hours. Apocalypto, a title which bears no overly apparent significance throughout the film, must be commended on its insight if nothing else. I walked out of the theater thinking ""huh, so that's what it was really like"", a reaction Gibson pleaded for with the screams of Jim Caviezel. I might mention that I also walked out of the theater feeling the need to shower. If its primitive booby traps, pagan rituals, and that ever so satisfying moment of revenge you seek, this Jungle Book on acid is for you.

760,roger_hs,Now results that Christians are the solution to every human problem.,1,13 December 2006,"After watching and crying with the passion of the Christ, I was ready and willing to spend my 6 dollars plus 10 in popcorn and Coke to enjoy 2 hours of big screen pleasure.Little did I know that after these 2 hours I wouldn't feel anything but hate towards Mr. Gibson and the whole production of Apocalypto.Don't get me wrong, if you watch this movie and consider it as what it is, a history irrelevant movie based on pure fiction hence mere entertainment, then by all means you will enjoy it. It is masterfully performed, directed, filmed. But the way Gibson presented a phenomenal culture and displayed it as nothing more than a bunch of ignorant, savage and degenerate culture is no less than infuriating.The Mayas, considered by many as one of the greatest cultures of human kind history. The single most influential culture of central America, which extended its reigns well past southern Mexico. This glorious culture was portrayed as a deeply decaying civilization in desperate need of an ""overhaul."" After a ""saddening"" account of a ravaged village of hunters by slave traders, Gibson provides a window into what, in his imagination, things might have been like.Lets not mention the deep knowledge of mathematics, astrology and other sciences that the Mayans mastered. Lets not mention that the Mayans disappeared without a trace. Lets not mention the complicated social structures and laws that the Mayans had. Finally, lets not mention anything good about the Mayans lets just act like a tabloid and sensationalize the absolutely incorrect notion that the Mayans were ungodly, unruly, savage, ignorant and everything bad in humans.And lets finish the movie by showing the knight in shining armor the ""Grand Conquistadors"" that arrived to the American ""savage"" cultures to Christianize them and save them from themselves while they pillaged, raped, robed and obliterated some of the biggest cultures that men didn't even got the chance to know in their full extent.Gibson, I am a Roman Catholic, I believe in Christ but you make me sick, you are no better than a tall hairdo waco tele evangelist that asks for money in return for miracles.This is the last time I pay for one of your movies.",Apocalypto
761,cychosis-1,This movie is outstanding!! Don't believe the Gibson-Haters!,10,17 December 2006,"This movie is far more than I ever expected, and it certainly wasn't as violent as people have been complaining about. Firstly, there is indeed some very graphic violent scenes, but the scenes certainly were not pornographic, and those images of violence were necessary in order to provide substance to the story. Secondly, there may indeed be some minor authenticity problems (such as architecture, time-line issues, etc.), but they are not glaring IMO and they certainly don't detract from the story or disrupt belief.The look and feel of the film is brilliant, and it truly makes you believe that this is a different time and place, as opposed to some Hollywood period piece with the flavor-of-the-month ""A"" list celebrity as the main attraction. If you are stupid, and you don't like reading, you may find the sub-titles annoying, but you should still enjoy the film. You can probably figure out what is going on, even without the sub-titles. That doesn't mean that the film is simple, but that the film has incredible non-stop action that will tell a story just as much as the sub-titles.And don't believe those idiot ""I hate the Jew-hater Mel Gibson"" crowd. I've read all kinds of reviews from a bunch of those idiots, and they are still upset over his beat-up Jesus movie. The drunk ""I hate Jews"" rant probably didn't help either. Still, they should judge the movie as opposed to the movie maker. Most of the negative reviews you will read are from dishonest folks that will complain about the film's violence, while seeming to forget how they loved ""Kill Bill.""",Apocalypto
762,dnjowett,Gibson's best so far,10,7 January 2007,"To be honest, Gibson has excelled himself. Personally, I was not too impressed with the native tongue used in The Passion, perhaps because I'm akin to atheism, but use of natural language in this film is brilliant. Everything about this film brings about feelings that say that this is indeed Gibson's finest work to date.Each face in the film is a story in itself, even if they have no audible lines in the film. Every tattoo, every barb, every necklace, every chain, are all different from person to person and the emotions shown are felt by the audience to the very core. The so called gore is justifiable with most fearful scenes containing sounds rather than pictures. A lot of the so-called abhorrence in my opinion may relate to the emotional disturbance at the beginning of the film.Gibson's latest hit, tells the story of a Mayan Forrest tribe which is set upon by a more 'mainstream' Mayan group who forces them into slavery. The Forrest tribe are taken to the main city where they are used as sacrifices for the Gods.The cinematography is brilliant, not to mention the music. For little known actors, the acting, not least of the main character is nothing short of superb. There is nothing predictable, accept maybe a 30 second stint toward the end, but even still, you are unsure of where the film will proceed even if you do predict correctly.I am absolutely appalled by the 'so-called' professional critics who are damning this movie to hell. They should be held for ransom and their bribe money for giving bad reviews given up for charity. This movie should be applauded, not abhorred.",Apocalypto
763,ericap-1,An incredible time machine,9,7 July 2007,"Watching this film I have been transported to a different time and culture. The story in itself was not that original, but the visual effects, make up, costumes and a very good shooting made me to forget everything out of the screen. The actors were not professional, sometimes for good (paw jaguar's wife, the prophecy girl), sometimes for wrong. The music was superb, and the jungle landscape,the cities and their temples were simply amazing. The final turn of the screw in the script (I will not reveal it) left me breathless. I hope the director-writer-producer, Mel Gibson, will go on filming such original and personal films, so far(for good) from the usual Hollywood-trend products we are doomed to ""enjoy"".",Apocalypto
764,kolja93,awful,1,22 March 2007,"I won't say anything about the story because there isn't one. It's basically one cheap shock effect after the other. Some critics said this movie was exciting but the only excitement is the kind of fear you get when you see something horrible about to happen. I don't need Hollywood to show me that violence is ugly, I can watch CNN or Aljazeera for that. Apart from that, it's historically inaccurate and if I were Mayan I'd be terribly insulted. Not that Hollywood would give a d*mn, apparently they feel free to take any culture they don't understand and hang a clichéd American story on it and then sell it. The message is pretty obvious: if you insist on being filthy pagans worshiping unclean gods we, as Christian Americans, have no other choice than to come to your country and CIVILISE you. I got the impression that mr Gibson tries to use violence to make the audience feel as if they're finally seeing something real, and that only he has the balls to show things the way they really are. And then he uses that emotional shock effect to hammer home the propaganda. But it's not real violence at all, it's cheap Hollywood gore. I think mr Gibson has something to prove, probably to the all seeing imaginary head monkey in the sky, and it shows in the unhealthy (really really unhealthy) fascination for pain. Yes that's what life is: opportunity after opportunity to experience pain, until the white man comes over with the cross to give you some more, and then you'll know your place in the pecking order. If you want to see pain and violence, go to chechnya or iraq (or a thousand other places), go prove you're a man! Do something worthwhile with the money wasted on this crap, get a foster child, send some money to amnesty international or whatever. Stop destroying culture!",Apocalypto
765,heystellaaaa,Shame on Gibson,1,15 January 2007,"I've been carefully reading the reviews on this movie, and I can't believe nor understand why so many people liked this festival of meaningless violence. First of all, the film amazingly lacks of historical reality. The Maya had cities with monumental architecture in the Classical Period (that is more or less from year 0 till 800-900 a.c.). Then they retreated to farming villages. So showing a city with ""pyramids"" together with the arrival of the conquerors is a total lie. Moreover, Gibson totally mixes imagery, traditions, gods, habits of many different pre-columbian groups and puts them together under the name of Maya. He used the model of El Tajin for the city, and of course El Tajin wasn't a Maya city! He depicts human sacrifice as a non-reasonable activity, when it made perfectly sense with their culture. I could go on forever with the obvious mistakes of the movie, but that would bore the non-scholar I guess. To continue with, the stereotype of the maya is completely false. This culture was one of the most advanced in their time, yet, they're depicted as illiterate savages, filthy, hungry for blood and suffering. It is funny how the city's dynamic (market, dancers, ceremonies, etc.) is shown more as a roman one than a pre-hispanic one. This is racist and also shows a profound and alarming ignorance. Apart from all this errors, I did not find the movie entertaining. It was boring from beginning to end, I've seen too many ""chase"" pictures before. The only good thing about this is that it brings the Maya to the front-pages, but good turns bad when it is awfully done. I hope Hollywood starts thinking about the consequences of these kind of films. Millions of dollars spent on production, not even a penny on research! A tip for Mel: if he wants to keep showing audiences violence, he doesn't need to travel to distant lands and times: all he has to do is look around, and, as an artist, fulfil his mission of trying to change what is wrong with our society. He should stop teaching hatred, ignorance and racism.",Apocalypto

767,paul-2878,Just enjoy the adventure,9,9 January 2007,"Why are some people so obsessed with historical accuracy or the deep messages the film is trying (or not) to portray? This is just a damn good adventure yarn and should not be treated as anything else.From the opening scene i was totally engrossed in the film. The fact that there were no major stars in the cast and also that it was subtitled instead of using accented English made it far more realistic, and the two hours or more simply flew by.The atmosphere builds and builds, and the last 40 minutes or so are breathtakingly relentless as the picture nears its climax. It would have been easy to tone down the violence and make this a 15, or even a 12, but somehow that would have detracted from the spectacle as a whole; having said that, it is nowhere near as violent or gruesome as some have made out and i would certainly not class it as gratuitous in any way - instead it just gives the viewer a rather more extreme take on the hero v villains scenario which is really the core of the entire adventure.Just go and enjoy Apocalypto for what it is. If you are looking for deep cultural enlightenment then you are wasting your time, but if you want good, honest, edge-of-the-seat entertainment with a decent spattering of blood and guts then it will be right up your street.",Apocalypto
768,zacknv,One of worst movies I've seen recently,2,1 February 2007,"OK, I gave this movie 2 for the effort. If the scenario wasn't as imaginative and the poster so interesting I would have probably given it a 0 (if I could).Fistly, it was full of inaccuracies. The Mayas were not proved to be into human sacrifices that much. The movie suggests that for the ""priests"" that were in charge of the sacrifices, this was a full-time job! Not to mention that by the time the Spaniards came to this area the Mayas were long gone! But I guess some Hollywood movies take it to themselves to rewrite history.Also, the movie is an insult to common sense. I mean who can run day and night and still have enough energy to fight? Who was this guy, Carl Lewis? And what about the guys who were chasing him. Not even a sign of fatigue or an impulse to give up? I wouldn't like to comment on the guy's luck, since it is far beyond any sense of proportion. If at the last scene aliens came and abducted his remaining pursuers I wouldn't be surprised at all after all we've seen him get away with! On the plus side, the movie is genuinely funny, if you see it as an imaginative comedy and not take anything it shows seriously. I reckon it is a good choice for 12-year-olds and for people who seek an alternative to cartoons.",Apocalypto

I thought to myself ""oh God!"" when I saw the ""civilized"" cross-carrying conquistadors. I heard people reject the film as being too violent. Please! History has been and is written in blood.

We endured 40 minutes of continuous senseless and extreme violence. The violence was towards men, as well as women and children. Much of it quite graphic. We could have taken about five minutes of it, if that was important to make a point in the story, but when graphic violence goes on and on just for the sake of violence, it turns into garbage. We sat there hoping and hoping that it was going to get better. After 40 minutes we couldn't take it anymore. We both walked out disgusted. Obviously we weren't the only ones feeling the same way. Right after we got up, another couple also got up, put their coats on and also walked out. If you like senseless violence with subtitles, this is the movie for you.

The fact that it had such a high budget makes it even more insulting. Anyone could have made a more coherent story, based on true facts, with the help of an elementary school text book. It was extremely disappointing to watch. The main flaws of this movie are: Lack of story. Historically, it is completely inaccurate. While the mayas were warriors, with a way of life that may seem barbaric to us, they were pretty advanced in various knowledge fields, such as astronomy and engineering. Besides, their lifestyle was defined by a complex set of believes, they were not cruel just for fun as they are depicted in the movie.

It has been quite awhile since I've seen a movie like this since ""The Naked Prey"" and I congratulate Mel on giving my imagination someplace to travel besides an office building,street corner,school house/yard, a lake or a desert. The movie unfortunately does not live up to it's title but it's pretty close. I understand it's just a movie and it's 'entertaiment' but it lacked something intellectual stimulating for me. Although he does let you know that even back then everyone wasn't sold on the idea of 'signs' and 'prophecy' but even that wasn't given much notice. Just a side note I suppose. A part from that it was a really enjoyable time. The second to the last line in the movie was just ridiculous.

But as i said if you don't mind so much violence, you may even cry and feel occasionally sentimental.

775,malcolm-jardine,A Wonderful Surprise,9,9 June 2007,"I delayed watching this movie for a long time given the bad reviews it has received and have just seen it on video. I wish now I had gone to see it at the cinema. The landscapes and the acting were simply breathtaking.The action is non-stop and although the film is over two hours in length it feels like much less. Yes, it is gory but the gore is realistic and serves a purpose. Too often the brutality of the past is sanitised in Hollywood movies. Watching this film made me think a great deal about the grim reality of bygone days and the price of war and empire building.What impressed me most about the film, however, was the quality of the acting and the characterisation. I had been led to believe by reviews that it would simply be a bloody chase movie but nothing could be further from the truth. I cared about the characters portrayed in this movie (I even found myself shouting out aloud at times!). I desperately wanted to know what happened to the kids in the forest, I felt bitterly for the big guy and his wife and mother in law, I found myself imagining the horror of the life awaiting the slaves in the hellish world they now found themselves in, I cursed jaguar Paw for so carelessly betraying his father and on and on. I even felt for the Mayan general whose son was killed by Jaguar paw and understood the motivations behind his relentless pursuit.It would have been all too easy for the Mayans to be simply portrayed as unfeeling monsters (as they first appear) but Gibson skilfully allows us to see them as human beings with strengths and weaknesses, the relations between the pursuing warriors and between the general and his son are particularly well--handled. I felt I knew them as individuals and this was achieved through minimal dialogue and action. I also sympathised with the desperation of the populace trapped in a terrible decline brought about by drought and disease.I have to give a special mention of the girl playing the child prophet. She was brilliant (and very sinister!) I have given the film 9 stars rather than 10 because I do think the plight of Jaguar Paw's wife and son was unnecessarily hammed up and also because there were too many historical inaccuracies for my liking (the condition of the Mayan city is more akin to the 9th/10th centuries than the 16th). Historical inaccuracies are a pet bug-bear of mine.",Apocalypto
776,moviemaster200300,The most intense movie of 2006!!!,10,22 June 2007,"Despite the fact that Mel Gibson is a not-so-great guy as a person, there's no denying that he's a master when it comes to film-making. This movie was not just fast paced and intense, it was visually stunning. The characters are all well developed so we actually care about them (and hate the bad guys). The acting was well done; there weren't any moments that had me rolling my eyes.The only turn-off would be the large amount of bloodshed throughout the movie. Although this doesn't bother me at all, there are a lot of people who will be nauseated by the violence. Among these scenes include people being sacrificed by having their hearts torn out, then being be-headed, and a person being completely torn apart by a Jaguar.The music fits the film extremely well. There's not much of a running theme. It's mostly underscoring; the type of music that keeps the film moving but doesn't completely stand out.There are many cool camera effects, especially the use of slow motion throughout the film. There are also many aerial camera angles, allowing us to see characters in pursuit of each other from the tree-tops.In a nutshell, this film is extremely intense, fast paced, and original. If you are looking for a film experience that you wont soon forget, I completely recommend it. If you have a weak stomach and don't enjoy being on the edge of your seat for 2 hours and 20 minutes, don't see this movie.",Apocalypto

I have also studied Aztec and Inca cultures. I don't know what culture this movie was about, but I can say for certain that it was not about any of the three I mentioned. This movie belongs in the Science Fiction section next to spaceballs. The opening scene, the Tapir chase, left me laughing so hard I almost cried. I have personally hunted and killed Tapirs, THEY DO NOT SQUEAL LIKE PIGS! I could go on and on about the inaccuracies of the animals and their sounds in this film, but the Indian culture itself is where Mel left all reality behind. The city scene looked like something out of a movie about ancient Egypt or Rome. Salve trade, open prostitution, butcher shops! FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! The Mayan, Aztec, and Inca cultures did not even have a an advanced numbering system, how much less a currency system with which to buy and sale. The only thing that did follow the Mayan culture was the tossing of the bodies down the stairs of the temple.The bottom line is that this movie was poorly researched and script was so predictable it was pitiful. All through the movie I unfailing predicted to my wife exactly what would happen in the next scene, so much so that she thought I had already seen the movie before.I was so disappointed after seeing this movie that I had to watch a B rated movie just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.

Yes visually great but some of the lines like ""He's F****d"". were inappropriate. This movie rates a 5 on 10 scale, and I liked it in parts. what a letdown.

It should not be marketed as an action movie, the only real action is near the end and rather lackluster. Second, the attempt at character development started out great, and fell out as soon as I realized that the main character was not the person i thought it was. The man who is the main character is about as interesting as waiting to get a tooth drilled. Also, since this movie went to great lengths to ensure that much of the scenery and props were period accurate, its a shame that the rest wasn't. Mel seems to have forgotten that most of the cultures of the region were farming in nature, and most got their captives from wars and mock wars. Instead, a very European concept of slavers is added. Normally, I wouldn't complain about such things, but if you are going to make a good deal of a movie accurate, you might as well go the whole way, (particularly in light of the fact that the ENTIRE movie is in subtitles. I get doing that with the Passion, but with something like this, not such a good idea). All in all, I don't regret watching it, but I'm glad it was at a friends and I didn't have to pay for it.

Because he is a fervent Christian (which is OK) but as a result he decided to twist history and show the Maya as a barbaric civilization (which is not OK). The massacre of the Maya by Cortez and his people (in the name of Christianity), becomes excusable after watching Apocalypto, makes Cortez look like a merciful savior that come to destroy nasty brutal Maya, beside its being a mean twist of history, MR. Gibson forgets that Cortez killed all not only Maya and the reason was not merciful but a one of greed.

783,jamang,give it a chance and be embraced,7,5 September 2009,"The movie starts fairly slow and you must give it a chance to embrace you, but it surely will. As all who have seen, i don' have to add more about how unbelievably authentic the film is - due to subtitle, native language, age and tools of the natives. The effects are directly adapted to their conditions and lift you tensely into its world, tightening your eagerness to see its outgo. Unfortunately the ending wasn't to my liking, as i think it was to simple. See for yourself. 7 Points my vote, with an appropriate ending maybe even 9...Ergo: Very well made and still mainly believable Mel Gibson did good work making what i guess he wanted it to be. A movie transcending its watcher into deep jungle, mischief, magic and hope with all it's effects. Moral is not one of them, but therefore nevertheless given in many short moments.",Apocalypto

Perhaps there are no two movies that address the human condition with the same insight and scope as these two films do. If you ever wonder what happens between the appearance of the monolith in 2001 and Pan Am docking with the space station, Apocalypto should answer many questions. For each piece of body-embedded jewelry, imagine an iThis or iThat. Think healthcare and war-in-iRaq. Consider the apes confronting the monolith, then the Mayan's confronting the Spanish ships.

Great actor play also-it makes you believe that this is actually happening, and the actors are real Mayas. And if somebody has something to say, about the movie, being too ""natural"" and too ""real"", I can tell that the life itself it is, so the movies should be, like this one!...Or else you wan't believe it!

786,sanjay-frasup,Never knew this side of the Mayans before.,8,13 May 2011,"Apocalypto is a historical adventure film which dwells into the lives of the Mayans and concentrates on the period of their decline. The plot revolves around a Mayan whose village is attacked by a group of tribal gangsters who deprive the village of its inhabitants and even killing a few of them, in short ravaging it. And then the plot thickens with his endeavors in the forest to escape the enemies and find his family.The movie is set in the forests of Mexico where this tribe of the Mayans(The Yucatan Mayans) originally belong to. The director, Mel Gibson, who is perhaps the only star quotient of the movie( he does no cameo), has taken care that the casting suits the theme of the movie and its background, with mostly Mexican and native Yucatan donning the roles.The movie, disgusting to start of with, depicts the ways of the Mayans in an unparliamentary way; as ruthless murderers, and people who believe in human sacrifice. The story takes into account the traditional elements like prophecies and stuff. Story is normal, but its the screenplay which scores for me. Racy fights, captivating surrounding and realistic characters make the movie a sure watch.The background music, although overshadowed by the pacey visuals, dwells well with the screenplay. The make up is a big plus for the movie creating the effect of the Mayan age, with all the rituals and stuff, given a boost.Overall the movie, without the presence of stellar actors impresses otherwise.",Apocalypto
787,counthenryviii,One of the Best Films of the Decade,10,13 August 2013,"People tend to give Mel Gibson a lot of shtick because of him being either anti-Semitic or just generally racist. I never for once believed he was and I think that it's sad that people try and destroy a filmmaker for doing something different. I thought The Passion of the Christ was a lot better than anyone else thought it was and I think Apocalypto is not only better than Passion but it's also one of the best films of the decade. I never judge a filmmaker by his personal life because that's his business and not the audiences. I judge a filmmaker on how good he can make his films and Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is a violent, brutal and spectacular masterpiece that is one of two films of 2006 that will go down in history as two of the most underrated and overlooked masterpieces of the 2000's. It's a deeply fascinating portrayal on an ancient civilisation that was coming to an end and as action adventure films go, this one of the best of it's kind in my opinion. It's suspenseful, full of characters that we care about and unbelievably nerve racking. On the whole, if you want to witness a director on the top of his game, then watch this spectacular piece of great filmmaking",Apocalypto

That at least gave me something to do besides check the movie timer. The scenery was enjoyable. However, it wasn't more spectacular than what you could see on any national geographic show.

I’m not talking about general everyday stuff like “do not seek revenge”, “be good to other people” and so on. No, I’m talking about catharsis that this work of art should induce – no, just forget about it.To be honest, there is a legitimate question about how gore in the movie is used. If you claim that you have an artistic movie that speaks about the end of an entire civilization, every aspect of the work should have a logical moral and aesthetic role. What is, then, the role of those violent scenes in Apocalypto? None, but to be violent and to entertain you! That is show-business, not art.The story itself is so shabby and vague that you learn only basics needed for the plot. This vagueness should not be excused and praised as “the inner” weakness of one civilization. No, this is Mel Gibson’s fault.It is not fair to present this movie and claim that it has a moral message. Not it does not.

791,Goatrider,Bloodthirsty film is a cross-over between The New World and Saw,4,11 January 2007,"With his The Passion of The Christ, Mel Gibson scored an unlikely hit. The self-financed screen version of the bible yield 370 million dollar, in the USA alone! All that in spite of the subtitles and the extreme violence, which provided the nickname 'The Jesus Christ Chainsaw Massacre'. For his next project, Gibson went to the rainforests where he shows the downfall of the Maya-culture. Virtuos, but again just as bloody as Jesus' suffering, and Gibson's Oscar-winning Braveheart.Mother-in-law jokesApocalypto starts of with the hunt for a tapir, which then is being slaughtered. Without a doubt a reference to Apocalupse Now, the Vietnam-movie where Francis Ford Coppola had an ox being slaughtered. The scene is also a warning for the faint hearted, who are now still able to run through the exit of the theater. Because anyone who, based on the poetic trailer, had expected a film like Terrence Malick's The New World will be deceived: Apocalypto, with his sadism, lies closer to Saw.You will notice nothing about that in the first part though. We see a peaceful forest community, which rural jokes about an impotent hunter. He's being offered the testicles of the slaughtered tapir and receives a pat from his mother-in-law. I'm not sure on whether the old Maya-culture would already know jokes about mothers-in-law, so I guess that this rural humor shows more than anything else the taste of Gibson.Blue Man GroupWhile after the harvest party, the hunters sleep it off, they are attacked by a much lesser peaceful tribe, clothed in skulls and piercings. The once so peaceful village suddenly becomes the spectacle of plundering, fire, murder and manslaughter. The also attacked hunter Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), Apocalypto's hero, is able to seize the opportunity to hide his wife and child in a well before he is taken captive. After a dreadful journey, the prisoners arrive in a city where it looks like slavery will be their fate. But after they are painted blue - in a scene that indiscriminately reminds me of Blue Man Group - it becomes clear that they will be sacrificed to please the gods. And that won't happen tenderly: hearts are being torn out, heads chopped off. Gibson shows it all, with as a 'climax' an image of what a chopped off head sees before it tumbles of the stairs. But will Jaguar Paw be saved from certain death? And if so, will he be back in time to save his wife?Spiritual Action MovieApocalypto is a bizarre film, a weird combination of pretentious 'beauty' and bloody sadism which looks like it comes straight from slashers like Saw. It is an interesting question how the film would have been received if it had been made by a unknown Latin-American director instead of Mel Gibson, whose previous film shows the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ in the bloodiest way possible. And now still I'm leaving out of account his problems with alcohol and his antisemite tirade. What does Mel want? Nothing more than a 'spiritual action movie' like his press-message claims? Well, enough action to be seen in this film, especially in the second part, where our hero becomes a SUPERhero with Messiah-ish accents: he even gets wounded in his side. But all the violence gets in the way of the spiritual part. After seeing this film, you wouldn't be surprised if Mel would direct the next sequel to Saw.Crucifixion of the MayasBut besides that, it seems like Mel wants to demonstrate that the whites - which discover their 'America' in the last scene - are not to blame for the violence and the diseases which wiped out the 5000 year old Maya-civilization. The film starts of with a quotation that claims that a civilization can only be exterminated from outside if it is being undermined from the inside. Gibson shows hunger, disease, mutual struggle, superstition and just as he only showed the SUFFERING of Jesus, in Apocalypto he focuses only on the violent ending of a civilization which mostly stayed intelligent and NON-violent for 5000 years.But Gibson doesn't care about that: we must see BLOOD! Furthermore he exonerate the white European conquerors. Such intentions - even more than the displayed violence itself - make Apocalypto a virtuos but dubious film.",Apocalypto

There seemed to be a lot of fuss about ""the movie being too violent"". Well i think the dose of violence was not more of some normal movies that you can see in the TV, on Saturday afternoon. In my opinion, some movies like ""city of god"",""American history x"", ""fight club"", robocop, ""the last samurai "" ""saving private Ryan"" without mentioning ultimate fighter competition (UFC) and K1 or fight club live competition that are much more violent than this film are normally in our TV...and the list is still really long.

I guess seeing the top of Lucy Liu's skull lopped off with a Samurai sword was a work of art. I suspect the leftist Hollywood crowd is more concerned with Gibson's Christianity than anything else. Since they were unable to censor ""The Passion Of The Christ"", I guess they've been going nuts over how to break Mel Gibson. I thought the movie was a good adventure yarn, but the history seems a little askew. If this was the end of the Mayan heyday, what were the Spaniards doing there at the end?I thought the Aztecs were ruling the roost, and that Cortes burned all his ships to quell a mutiny. Other than that, it's a fine flick and from what I've seen from Archaeological writings and what not, pretty accurate.",Apocalypto

The film is filled with suspense, having you on the end of your seat; biting your nails. Apocalypto gives the viewer an insight on tribes that live in the rainforest, and the things that they do to ensure that they survive.

I don't want to accuse racism but I would like to see a public explanation regarding the movie's gross misrepresentations of the Maya. (Wishful thinking) There seemed to be a stereotype feeling to the movie, with respect to the characters. It's like categorizing, as oriental, all Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, etc. An Indian (Native American) is not just an Indian. There were Mayans, Aztecs, Toltecs and other tribes. The story claims to depict the Mayan Civilization, yet much of the movies scenes suggest Aztec rituals and behavior.There are too many items to mention but the disregard for the, strongly documented, astrological brilliance of the Mayans cannot be overlooked. A solar eclipse would have been forecast by the Mayans and, thus would not have affected them anywhere near what the movie depicted.",Apocalypto

Simply just a beautiful motion picture. It's not a documentary or a biography base on true factual events. Mel Gibson never said it was a true story he used the mayan language and threw in a bunch of both Mayan and Aztec traditional history and everyone should just shut up and appreciate it. If this film isn't your style then OK fine, but all these haters should just calm down for crying out loud! I mean from beginning to end, this film's intensity carries you like no other film in a long time. It has all the ingredients to equal a complete film with an appropriate ending. Shocking moments that will make you jump! Unbelievable scenes that are so amazing, you can't understand how anyone can actually put it on screen and make it look believable. Apacolytpo is another instant classic that will sky rocket to the top with the rest of best films of all time. Even with sub titles, you're still able to enjoy the picture.

798,inlovewithmovies,One of the most underrated masterpieces,10,17 June 2007,"I have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who was trying to minimize the violence of this movie as not more than most action films. The reviewer had asserted that the descriptions of ""brutallay violent,"" ""sadistic barbarity,"" and ""unrelenting violence"" were inaccurate. Well, it's more than that......in fact, I would say that it takes barbarous violence to a whole new level.....but, what would you expect from a movie that is about human sacrifice and village plundering!!! A Disney movie about a Native American, this movie is not! The difference between this movie and say a movie like Saw is that Saw uses needless violence just to titillate audiences, this movie takes you back in time and you shows you what it was like, blood and all. I've always hated movies that go back to a historical event and wimps out by not showing how bloodthirsty and cruel a certain ritual was--somehow trying to sugarcoat the ugly parts of history.I admit that I didn't like the first 45 minutes of this movie...in fact, I was thinking ""oh. oh. this looks like a dud."" But, something happened when the movie moves to the incredible Mayan Civilization. The incredible majesty of the tower, the exotic looks of the people with face tattoos, brightly colored dress, and menacing piercings is a sight to behold. Whoever did the casting should get a pat on the back because the faces were very convincing. It felt like you were watching Mayan people rather than out of work actors from Central Casting Extra agency. At that point in the movie, you feel like you are transported back in time to this period and watching the real thing..... when the people are lined up to be the next human sacrifice, you can feel the fear. From there, you are taken on a pulse-pounding ride that never lets up. I kept thinking ""wow"" wished I had watched this in the theaters instead of on DVD. It's incredible. Nothing was cookie-cutter. Nothing was pandering. Gibson and his DP showed some of the most creative ways to film back to back action sequences while not making it redundant like some of the Matrix sequels. Obviously, Mel Gibson has some demons and I did not appreciate his recent remarks, but I just can't deny his work. This was a masterpiece and one that I didn't even expect to find. I expected something good, but it totally blew me away. I really hope that more movies are made about this civilization. It's really fascinating. I was always intrigued when reading about this period and would love to see more movies like Apocalypto.",Apocalypto

801,kapil-v-kale,excellent,8,9 December 2006,"Go out and see Apocalypto while it is still in theaters.The first thing that came to mind after I saw the movie was that it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. The cinematography is stunning and the camera-work completely engulfs you in the world of the Maya. The scenes filmed in the forest are rich, and the performance from ""Almost"" is award-worthy. Moreover, the thriller-quality of the movie is unparalleled-- I found myself at the edge of my seat the entire way through the movie (save some of the slower moving portions around the middle).Gibson keeps the movie short on dialogue. The nonverbal aspect makes the fast-paced second half resplendent with visual detail and raw action, without distraction . However, the film is, well, short on dialogue, making Apocalypto the type of movie that everyone should see once, but probably not again. The first half of the movie is chilling but slow-moving. Since the film doesn't revolve as much around character interaction and more around the visuals presented and the action taking place, I would find it hard to find something new within what I already saw. But the lack of replay value does not detract from Gibson's work. The quality of it lies in what he presents-- a dark and chilling depiction of pre-colonial mesoamerican life.It is kind of hard to imagine that the film comes from a dude that did all four Lethal Weapons.",Apocalypto

There have been many movies about native American tribes, but this one tales you right into the heart of Mayan culture.The summary here on IMDb is a little misleading. Jaguar Paw was not running from the sacrifice at all. In fact, he was not afraid when it was his turn. The reason he ran was because he was going to be executed outside the sacrifice, and he had a pregnant wife and young son to go rescue.The IMDb summary is misleading in that way, as it makes Jaguar Paw seem very weak. Instead, he is a true warrior.There isn't much else I can say about this film that hasn't already been said. Great action, great cinematography, and outstanding acting. Mel has redeemed himself in my eyes...Apocalypto is proof positive that people's personal lives, no matter how bad they are, have no relation to the great films they make. Hell, Roman Polanski should have been the primary proof of that. If Hollywood can forgive a child molester, they can forgive Mel.One line sticks with me after this film, and it is this line that shows you just who the real warrior of the film is. ""I am Jaguar Paw. I hunted this forest with my father, and my sons will hunt here with their sons when I am gone. I am a Hunter, and this is my forest. Come on.""

804,pamtnman,Fantastic movie blends all the right ingredients,10,12 May 2019,"Great quest story, adventure, love, war, scenic views, good guy wins ending. The costumes and sets are incredible. The acting is unbelievable, so realistic and gripping, especially when we consider that many of the Holcane actors are not professional or even novice actors, but regular Joes plucked from native people living in Mexico. What a relief to not see European skin tones among the Mayan people here (like Charles Bronson playing Geronimo). Historically it is accurate enough to be believable, and it may be perfectly accurate. Mayan civilization had three crashes, or two-and-a-half, and this movie captures the last one perfectly. All the apparent or believed causes of the end of Mayan civilization(s) are shown in Apocalypto: Destroyed environment, poor farming practices, poor water management, poor waste management (piles of dead, rotting sacrificial human bodies leaching into the water supplies), drought, too much war, rotten culture (based on human sacrifice, slavery, cruelty) destined to burn itself out. This movie was for some reason hard to get on DVD, although now in mid 2019 that seems to be rectified, and we could watch it over and over. Definitely watch the bonus material, like how the movie was made, and the one deleted scene WITH commentary. The costumes were all hand made, almost exclusively using natural native ingredients, and the enormous sets were like those from Cecil DeMille epics 70 years ago. It is possible that this movie did not get the attention it deserved because Gibson went on a famously publicized drunken rant not too long after the movie debuted, which set his career and movies back a lot.",Apocalypto
805,FLVRTM,"Being DIFFERENT, however, is certainly enough to have gotten my attention, and Apocalypto might just do well at years end.",7,9 December 2006,"Upon first viewing of the trailer of Apocalypto, I was completely engrossed. If there was one word to describe the feeling of depth and mass scale for the film Apocalypto, it would be the blatantly overused, and sometimes genre-defining word, ""epic."" The trailer, however, painted what seemed to be a different picture from the actual film.What can we say about the talented Mr. Mel Gibson? He is immensely talented and it seems he is always trying to break new and different ground. His desire for epic proportions led to mixed-results in his newest venture that follows a young man fleeing from his Mayan captors.At the start of the film, comic relief and a sense of brotherhood provoked a sense of well-being and belonging-- You feel as if you were a part of the village, almost family, and accepted). Murder, rape, and slavery then became the key messages that brought those exact feelings burning down.There were moments where I fought to hold back my tears. There were moments of extreme suffering and, as a result, there were moments of self-questioning and the questioning of both human nature and human ideals. Sadly, over the course of the film, these emotions were only sparingly triggered. The majority of the film did pass as an event more neutral than anything else.The first half of the film seemed to entail, instead of the overall epic feeling, a more grassroots, or even documentary feel. At times, one feels as if he or she is viewing a modern documentary on a group of indigenous people-- This was further bolstered by what seemed to be a very ""documentarian"" cinematography and shooting style...Cinematography-wise, one is teased by a crisp, almost ""digital"" picture that reaffirms the feeling of watching am almost-live documentary. Following the lines of documentary-shooting, there seemed to be an excess of close-up shots, which went in line with the style described above, but only for shame. To contrast, the shots that were taken from a distance were breathtaking and allowed one to truly feel the scope and majesty of the Mayan empire as being nothing shy of ""epic."" There was plenty of nudity (recall ""documentary"") as well as violence. With the bloodshed being so abundant, one had several occasions to view tricky camera cuts and angles as well as modern-day special effects and rigs, which leads me to point out several flaws-- though some of the special effects were right on mark, many were not. (There was a specific scene that was highlighted with ""squirting blood"" that would embarrass even a particular ""Addams Family"" film; This had also triggered the wrong reaction from the audience). With Apocalypto, miscalculated timing and laughter seemed to happen more than the norm, which was quite unfortunate.Putting aside special effects gone awry, I have to admit that the worst thing about this film was the level of predictability. There seemed to be an understated parallelism with ""Lord of the Flies""-- I was able to predict not only the smaller twists of the story but also the Deus Ex Machina (which was far from holding any importance to the actual story and accordingly seemed quite unnecessary).I also have to admit, though, that the best thing this film has going for it is that it is different. Apocalypto squeezed the meanings of the words ""grassroots"" and ""documentary,"" and Mel Gibson painted a different face to the tried picture: A story of a people, happy and content with life, suddenly facing an abrupt change.Apocalypto strived to be different. It was filmed in the native Yucatec Maya language and appropriately subtitled. It managed to tap into a feeling similar to that of a documentary, but at times, it also managed to look epic. I could only wish that ""epic"" had been tapped into much more than it had been. And there were moments that the professionalism or polish one would expect from such a top-notch production were not present.Different, however, is certainly enough to have gotten my attention, and Apocalypto might just do well at years end. And if you find yourself unsure about attending one of ""those"" end-of-the-year children's holiday films or ""that"" holiday comedy, adding Apocalypto to the equation might not be such a bad idea after all.",Apocalypto

I'm not convinced it's a message movie at all. The film's value lies in its limitless ability to pump adrenaline. The movie belongs in the action section when it goes to video. And in that genre, hardly another movie will be able to hold a candle to it.Apocalypto delivers a rush that does not let up. Once the real action starts, brilliant images unlike any showcased in cinema flash across the screen with dizzying speed.

Neither were they bloodthirsty savages, the way the city dwelling ""bad guys"" were depicted. The ancient Maya would have never raided commoners for sacrifice. There was a very strict code of honor among the Maya of the time. Only elite warriors and rulers were ever sacrificed. There were never any pits filled with thousands of dead victims the way the movie shows. Ritual sacrifice actually served to reduce bloodshed, not increase it. Gibson has packaged this turd in fancy wrapping by using Yucatec Maya. Don't be fooled. This is nothing but a ploy to give his lies a veneer of legitimacy. Apocalypto is no different from D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation. It is merely an extended racist epithet.",Apocalypto
812,wilhelmankar,Visceral,9,23 May 2017,"In my view, this is perhaps Gibson's best film. It's theme can be summarized as ""escape and survival"" and it does not take long for the movie to grab you and keep you paralyzed until it's last minute.As always, Gibson gives paramount importance to authenticity and atmosphere. Even though full historical accuracy obviously has been forced to give way to practical considerations in some instances, this movie still has a very ""real"" feel to it; the characters all speak authentic Mayan accents and the producers have done excellent scenography work. The film contains some gut-wrenching depictions of violence, but they all serve the purpose of authenticity and never devolve into aggrandizement. By all accounts, pre-Columbian Mesoamerica was an exceedingly brutal time and place to be alive in – Gibson captures this without going overboard.There is no false advertising with this movie – it gives you exactly what it says it will. It is 100% suspense from start to finish. Warmly recommended.",Apocalypto
813,IslandGuy,"Horrible, excessively violent and historically unsupportable",1,20 December 2006,"I expected to like this movie. Nope -- not even a little. At the end, my wife and I looked at each other and said 'What was the point of that?' The gore is graphic in the extreme, without any redeeming value whatsoever. (For example, I would say the violence in 'Saving Private Ryan' was about as bad, but in the context of the plot it made sense.) This doesn't. You've just got some evil villains coming in and slaughtering the peaceful villagers, sadistic villains torturing the prisoners, and crazed priests eviscerating the human sacrifices.Meanwhile there's nothing in the movie that provides any insight into why the villains behave as they do, nor do we get any context that makes sense. We're supposed to think this film is about the decline of a great culture, but we learn nothing of what made the culture great, and discover nothing about the causes or even mechanisms of its decline.And, of course, the Spanish showing up at the end is just a ridiculous plot device -- they are only 500 years early.Again, horrible. Don't waste your money or time. Worst movie I've paid to see since ... since ... I can't even come up with a worse example.",Apocalypto
814,retrograde-1,More than just an action film,10,1 February 2007,First of all id like to say I really liked this film. There may have been some contrived plot developments in order to keep the story moving but I think as a whole it turned out to be a very entertaining action adventure and an effective political/environmental allegory on civilisation and the consequences of power and excess. It was shot almost entirely on digital camera which is a bold step for a film of this nature. It gives it a unique feel and the cinematography and costumes are some of the best I've seen. Mel Gibson really did his homework here with even the language used by the natives delivered in an authentic ancient South American dialect. Much as been said about the historical inaccuracy of the natives and the time period in which the film was set and unfairly so in my opinion. It is not a documentary and its main emphasis is to entertain so obviously there needs to be some suspension of disbelief in order for it to work like most films in this genre. Some fine performances by all the cast with Rudy Youngblood giving an excellent performance as the main character (Jaguar Paw). Special mention to the invading Mayan tribe leader (Zero Wolf) who really makes his character believable as a nasty villain whose not to be messed with!,Apocalypto
815,oleg88,Exciting AND Educational!,10,21 January 2007,"To be honest, I did not expect much of Apocalypto, it being a history movie with unknown actors.But in the first 10 minutes i was already drawn into the movie. I forgot that I was watching actors, instead, a whole epic has began to take place before my eyes.The script is well thought through. Mel familiarizes us with the characters by showing their day-to-day life where he mixes action, humor, honor and love. Then the movie takes on a neck-breaking pace. All the action and tension have really made my heart beat faster! Not many movies have achieved this.Previously, I have read that the majority of the Mayan empire did not die from the illnesses brought by the invaders, but actually from a disease caused by the severe drought at that time. So well done to Mel Gibson for doing careful research. The costumes and the hunting devices are just brilliant! It is like a documentary, only ten times better.I also have to mention that the camera work and the music are outstanding. It looks like Mel put his soul into this movie! I now forgive him his drunk driving, and look forward to his future films.",Apocalypto

Thanks Mel for such a great film. I hope to see anything that come to us from you here.

You get attached to the guy being bullied but his character just disappears. Insted the bullying guy is the main character. There is no deep meaning in this film, just a long walk and a long run back. I would expect some more back story to the events in the town. The town inhabitants all just seem crazy for no reason. A random girl on the long walk forsees everything that's about to happen.If you like action with a lot of blood splatter and weak character build up on both the bad guys and the good guys this is for you.",Apocalypto
818,youngmann223,Before a civilization can be destroyed from without it must first destroy itself from within....... With Fear.,10,11 December 2006,"First of all, I want to say that I think it's wrong for people to hate this movie because of what Mel Gibson said in Malibu this past July. So many people have missed the brilliant message of this film because they're too busy trying to find something they can criticize about it. And most reviewers won't admit that (except for those with unforgivable hatred towards Gibson) because they want their opinions to be seen as legitimate and able enough to help inhibit him from receiving any accolades. It's unfair because Mel Gibson has delivered a beautiful, kinetic story which embraces the realistic truths of the human soul.To me the Mayan Civilization is nothing more than a backdrop to provide an extreme archetype for the ideas of the story. Whether or not some of the facts about the culture or religious customs is accurate was insignificant to me. What I found significant was the main character's internal struggle with the notion that ""fear"" is the sickness which destroy's man from the inside out. This idea is applied metaphorically both to the individual and society. It means that once fear overtakes and consumes you, then you are in turn vulnerable to the outside world. The ""world"" being shown as extremely brutal and dark will pounce and destroy you (Like a Panther) once it sees the fear within. It's not entirely a new or innovative idea. But what is interesting is how Gibson shows the flip-side of this by making the main character Jaguar Paw immune and unaffected by the fear, which consumed his village friends when taken over. As the story progresses and the viewers realize what is happening, unlikely events him seemingly fall into place in Jaguar's favor such as the eclipse scene as well as the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors. The planets literally align themselves to protect him from annihilation as his spirit is without fear of failure. He has a mission and he is able to execute that mission, free of mind and trusting in his faith. He has faith in himself, faith in the forest, faith in destiny that he will get back and save his family and persevere through adversity no matter what the odds..... And he does, while the world brings forth a new beginning. A pleasure to watch.",Apocalypto
819,greatwhitejawahunter,Gibson was more fair to the Mayans than to the English in Braveheart,9,9 July 2007,"I just got done watching Apocalypto and thought it was an excellent film, but I was very sad to see the amount of bashing it got from being an ""unfair depiction of the Mayans."" What's unfair about the depiction of the Mayans? It seems to come from scenes of brutal human sacrifice and wanton violence. But wait, let's go back to the film's first act where we see the Maya in their village life. The village is filled with loving families (there are some domestic disputes but who doesn't have those?), wonderful storytelling around the campfire, some chaste dancing, lots of loving, and a good dose of jocular humor. They have a peaceful wish of how they want their legacy to continue: ""This was my father's forest, and all my sons will hunt here after me."" One scene reveals that they are untrusting of outsiders, but being that times are tough (as they always are in village life no matter what any one says) can you blame them? I read one reviewer say that this movie fails in its goals because it promised to be a depiction of the end of the Mayan civilization, however since no one knows how the Mayan civilization really vanished, then any attempt that this movie makes to depict their fall is inaccurate. I can understand this brand of logic, but can not agree with it. This film presents a possible scenario of how the Mayans fell, not the definitive one, but one that Mel Gibson was not ignorant in devising for this film either.While it's true that we do not know how the Mayan civilization died out we do know how other civilizations did. Take the Romans for instance, whose fall is well documented. There was even a recent Oscar-winning movie about it: Gladiator, which also had a healthy dose of historical inaccuracies, but I mention it because nobody complained about that movie being unfair to Romans. In that film Rome was characterized as a mob, with an insatiable thirst to watch people get butchered for entertainment's sake while ignoring the problems around them. (Even today we love to watch people get tortured and killed, we've just found a way to show it without actually killing anyone.) Considder how the sacrificial scene in Apocolypto is treated in a similar manner as the gladiator battles. The horde of Mayans as well as the Romans were enjoying watching people get hacked apart in the coliseum and atop the temple. Both groups enjoyed it so much that they were in a manic frenzy. Rome's strategy for controlling the masses is that if you entertain them enough, then they wont be as apt to complain about the more important issues. Is it such a stretch to imagine that the Mayan and Roman civilizations fell for similar reasons? Gibson seems to think that it's not. In his audio commentary on the DVD during the human sacrifice scene, Gibson talks about how Mayans were very erudite in astrology, yet the idea behind that scene and especially during the eclipse was about using information to control the masses. Of coarse the priests doing the sacrificing knew that the eclipse was coming, but was sacrificing people anyway as a show for the masses. When the eclipse came as scheduled the priests manipulated the people into believing that the gods were appeased, and that they could continue on destroying the land, building their city bigger.This scene illustrates the corruption that could have existed in the Mayan world, and can exist in even the most advanced civilization. Considering our current state in politics, the economy, the entertainment industry, is our civilization far from similar corruption? Are we a fate similar to that of the Romans, or even the Mayans? Perhaps, perhaps not. The heart of this movie is protecting your family in the face of a civilization about to self destruct, which should resonate as powerful today as it did for Jaguar Paw, and the world he lived in. It did for me.",Apocalypto
820,bridgeburner99,Interesting Failure,6,21 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's Apocolypto is not to be avoided for historical inaccuracy or heavy-handed preachiness or any number of other intellectual reasons. The simple fact is that it's just not a very good movie from a technical and structural standpoint. The cinematography is decidedly lacking, the editing is choppy and the script is badly paced and ultimately a rather stock construction. This is a clichéd story about the young family man who avenges a wrong and in the process grows to full adulthood. I say clichéd because Apocolypto offers nothing new or insightful to this standard tale except the trappings of pre-colonial MesoAmerican culture.The historical inaccuracies are somewhat significant, but could more easily be excused if they truly added to the film. Unfortunately, they don't. This could have been solved simply by ensuring that the city people were identified as Aztec rather than Maya. It was the Aztecs that were at their height when the Spanish arrived. The Maya civilization had crumbled nearly 500 years before to become small and non-centralized villages like the one Jaguar Paw is from. This is significant because it is one of the main reasons that the Maya managed to continue their rebellion against European colonization up through the end of the 19th century, while the Aztecs fell almost immediately.The ""look"" of things is excellent. The artistic designers and researchers for Apocolypto clearly did their homework and the film is almost worth seeing simply to watch a moving picture of what we know of Maya life. We don't truly get to see enough of it, however. Most of the film is taken up with shaky camera work running through the rain forest. And running and running and running.The message of the pitfalls of conspicuous consumption is lost through oversimplification and lack of focus. When we enter the Great City, we are overwhelmed by the filth and the shocking degree of poverty juxtaposed against the idle and lavishly rich -- and then come the bloody human sacrifices. The movie clumsily fails to articulate that the reason Jaguar Paw's simple forest people are to be esteemed over the city dwellers isn't because one group is kindly and the other is evil. Jaguar Paw's people manage to live within their environment without destroying it while the city dwellers are burning up their resources faster than they can be replaced and then falling to more and more drastic measures of trying to appease their gods. Because not enough trouble is taken to show the point of view of the city dwellers and why they act as they do, we consequently find no reason for their barbarity but to label them ""evil"".It is worth mentioning that the character of Zero Wolf offers the only glimpse of real humanity among the city people. He is a man of integrity and a proud father. He is not portrayed as evil, but because he is the only city dweller who seems to have any personal integrity, his character serves as a flail for the others. He stands out as an exception that only makes his fellows look worse in comparison.Ultimately, the film is mediocre, not because Mel Gibson had an agenda or didn't do his homework, but because it wasn't well written of filmed. Gibson is to be commended for taking on the project. Regardless of whether one likes or dislikes the film, it is inevitable that one of Gibson's aims will be reached - the legitimizing and popularizing of indigenous Maya languages. Also, it is to be expected that more people will now become interested in finding out about Maya culture and also become aware of the fact that there are still some 6 million Maya living in Central America today, mostly in deplorable conditions due to centuries of racial discrimination. For these things alone, I'm glad the film was made and is having such a big splash. It's a good thing too since it hasn't much to recommend it simply as a work of cinema.",Apocalypto
821,JerrySun,"Decent action, but entirely missing a purpose",6,8 January 2007,"A Mayan movie sounded like an unconventionally great idea. The trailers were confusing, but I heard good reviews, and that all of the first-time tribal actors did a good job. So, I went to see this movie with high expectations, hoping Hollywood would not shame the Mayans.The movie begins with a cheap scare from a boar running through grass, and an unimpressive sequence of Mayans using nets to direct the boar into a trap. Then, you see the whole village laugh about sex and genitals. I can't believe Smoke Frog got tricked into putting a pain-inducing ointment on his member LOL! Man, that was funny. With all the attention on chubby Smoke Frog, he seemed like the underdog-hero archetype. I just knew he would someday gather the courage to stand up for himself, and finally be able to fertilize his wife. Mel Gibson would have hit an inspirational jackpot if that moment had occurred. However, this misleader is unintentional. He and his wife both die insignificant deaths, and the hero is the asshole who picks on him. The invasion of the village was exactly what you would expect from Gibson: a big mess of violence and gore. Sometimes they used sticks with hoops on the end to choke from behind. Was that supposed to pass as the defining characteristic of this movie's big battle scene? While traveling, one bad guy shoves a captive off the cliff to show how unpredictable and evil he is, which is the most predictable personality for villains. Then, they encounter an abandoned little girl who pleads for help, but she gets pushed away by a stick (scabs=disease). She then goes into a demonic/split-personality mode and talks some trash that sounds like she was tipped off by the gods about upcoming catastrophes. At that moment I thought, ""that made no sense."" It was like a tactic stolen from a Japanese horror...very sad. Scary children who say incoherent things about fate for no reason is SO Cliché. Someone shoot me(l Gibson).The city was probably the worst part. There were so many shots of entranced people, I felt bored and empty. It almost belittled the Mayans, who are known for sophistication. For example, here's what I learned in total: the ones to be sacrificed are hand-painted blue, except for butt cheeks; a woman can gain freedom if no one wants to bid on her (i.e. she's too old for a good rape); the Mayan city consists of a marketplace and old women who look like they will never stop praying hopelessly in a drug-induced trance. You see three drawings on the walls that show how they will die: they are led on a stick, put lying down, and head decapitated. The way an illiterate deaf child would tell a story. Then, you see it happen exactly as the drawings showed. Very subtle, Mel.The escapement was probably my favorite part. There were cool special effects, such as arrows barely missing the escapees, then some gore injected here and there. The combination of action and quicker pace was refreshing. J.P. claims after jumping off of a waterfall that it's his territory now and they will have to play by his rules. Seriously, like I have not seen that before. It's been done earlier than Home Alone, and also the repeating of his father's quote is another tool typical of ""epic"" Hollywood movies. At 19, I am terribly tired of clichés. Another cliché: he's on a tree, but his blood actually drips onto one of the chaser's backs. I was glad when it didn't make them stop immediately. But, they later notice and figure him out. Wait, the movie almost ended early? If the writers wanted to be clever, they could have used more than three tricks--poisonous frog, bee hive (exclusive to his acre???), and the boar trap. The boar trap was a welcomed surprise. It's pretty bad ass to see the string and broken bone disengage, entailing the spikes. The animals were fake sometimes, and I couldn't help laughing when the baby popped out underwater like a clumsy doll. And apparently Mexicans don't float? Even if they couldn't swim (despite living by lots of water), the mother almost climbed out of the hole on a rope, but couldn't grasp onto the sides? In conclusion, this movie was not extraordinary, and I don't regret seeing it for free. The environment, people, costumes, and language all seemed very authentic. It was cohesive and straight-forward, and the action/choreography did not have distracting flaws. But, the flaw is the script. The good vs. bad dynamic is very generic. There is no historical importance. This movie reprises quotes like, ""this is my forest"" and ""come back to me"", the way any typical ""epic"" movie would. Things are over-promised, such as Smoke Frog swearing revenge--he just dies off! The quote in the beginning alludes to the downfall of the Mayan empire. Where was that??? There was no moral to this story. Mel Gibson is either trying to recreate Braveheart with excess gore, or he's addicted to violence/torture. The cinematography was also average. Some footage looked like it was filmed on a camcorder (the frame rate). I'm tired of Hollywood portraying non-white historical groups as being primitive and impractically fixated with their religion. Propheseying children, crazy people praying, stuck-up royalty women. This movie could have been set in Egypt, Iraq, or Asia... it doesn't matter. Is this movie a MesoAmerican Rambo?(--USA Today) Honestly, I rate it 7 /10 (3.5 /5 = above average). I'm sure this movie had a lot of potential in its infancy. A good suggestion for Mel would be to shorten it, or a complete overhaul. Towards the end, the family decides to go deeper into the forest to start anew. Good luck, family of four...hopefully you don't end up like the short-haired guy whom you are quoting (captured). 1st priority of credits: reiterate ""Mel Gibson"". Was this movie insecure to begin with? I'll never know.",Apocalypto
822,phil-58496,rather unrealistic,2,19 June 2019,"The first problem is in the first scene, the tapir hunt. I'm not a hunter myself, but hunting has a long tradition where I live. From these hunters I know that there is always some sort of gratitude and begging for forgiveness involved. They approach the dying animal with huge respect and veneration. It is a mystic moment when the animals dies, as it is the case with every birth and death.You certainly don't joke around and rip the flesh apart at this special moment. The prey is not a piece of meat you buy from a supermarket, it's something completely different. Hunters usually pay respect to the dead animal and treat is accordingly. When they carry the animal home, they stick a twig from a tree in its snout as an ornament. It is a ritual, a last homage to the beautiful and wonderful creature, similar to funeral rituals we perform when one of us has died.The way this hunt scene is depicted in this film is absolutely incredible. Native forest people learn from early age on to respect every living creature they are surrounded with, not only because it is the source of their existence, but also because they feel themselves part of that forest universe. Every tree, every leaf, every insect is part of that, including the human species.The second problem follows soon after. We see rather primitive 'Mayans' with clubs and stone knives (no metal tools or weapons), which is correct, however the men are always perfectly shaved, as if they just walked out of the barber shop. Well, they did just walk out of the barber shop, they are actors in a movie picture. Reminds me of old western movies where in every scene the hero was always perfectly shaved. But these were the 50's, I would think that it is nowadays common practice to show a real man's stubble, especially if the actors speak the Mayan language for greater authenticity. Which is, by the way, something I liked about this film. I think most of us liked that detail. This was well done. I also liked the ant scene.The third problem became quickly apparent in the first act as well: the reductionist depiction of 'good guys' and exaggerated monstrous 'bad guys'. I know this is a device to tell the story, to build sympathy for the hero and antipathy for the villains, but it is so worn out. I'm also aware that the brutal ripping apart of the tapir in the hunting scene, with the heart as the most precious reward, is a foreshadowing of what is to come. But it just doesn't work in my opinion, it's primitive and silly.I won't go into the other problematic aspects of this film, because this has already been mentioned in early comments here (for those interested, scroll down several times), and because I didn't continue watching. One comment (or review from other place) that mentioned the similarity of the solar eclipse scene to the Tintin story was enough for me. I already hated this scene in this Tintin story because of its colonial white-race-is-superiour attitude.So these are numerous quite unacceptable major flaws in a movie picture that could have been very good. Personally I simply reject to be entertained by beautiful cinematography and acting alone. I rather re-watch the Bruno Manser documentary 'Laki Penan' which gives you a short glimpse of true depiction of native forest people.",Apocalypto
823,lisaleonguerrero,Imagination versus Theory,10,12 December 2006,"Finally, a epic about ancient America! After much travel to temples in Central America, I was astontished at the amount of knowledge yet to be gained about the complete history of those Pre-Columbian cultures. What we do know is subjective and based on incomplete information. New discoveries found every day have yet to make their way into consensus reality. With this in mind, I was free to allow Apocalypto to captivate my imagination as a brilliant allegory, not depiction of absolute fact. Yes, there may be some inaccuracies, but it remains an illuminated and prophetic work of storytelling. It is a testament to the grotesque nature of power and an eloquent depiction of how ignorance combined with fear and violence are used to control humanity. Captivating cinematography and thrilling action make an effective medium to convey deeper meaning with a lasting effect. This film is very memorable. I invite viewers to see this film with an open mind. Official critics may oppose Mel Gibson as an individual, but they cannot deny his genius as a filmmaker. Whatever they may say about this film, the bottom line is Apocalypto is a brilliant work of art and an important, groundbreaking film.",Apocalypto
824,klessa,A great action film,8,29 December 2006,"It was not as incessantly violent as I had anticipated. The violence seemed to be appropriate, in all cases, to the action and story taking place.The main character of the movie, Jaguar Paw, is played by a complete 'unknown' named Rudy Youngblood who was apparently cast after Mel made him run around a conference table to show his form. He's simply beautiful. And he did an incredible acting job.There's a scene where he mentally goes from being the hunted victim to being the hunter and it's completely played out on his face and is a lesson in acting in itself. He ""becomes"" himself for the first time in that scene and it's a beautiful bit of film.The body art on all the actors was stunning -- really intricate tattooing and scarification that was beautiful, accented by piercing jewelry.My thoughts. First and foremost, if Mel was trying to highlight the dangers of a godless society, it missed it for me. What came across most was the mindless stupidity of masses of people worshiping a religion (any religion), and the dangers of a caste society. The bloodthirsty natives and the blood sacrifices? It highlighted religious fervor gone awry more than anything, and in my mind religious fervor is a problem regardless of the flavor of religion involved, and this film confirmed that. The movie was beautifully shot, and yes, it was violent and graphic, but seriously that did not seem like the ""predominant"" tone of the movie to me when it is taken as a whole. The cinematography was amazing.Some aspects were incredibly trite. For example, the ""bad"" civilization is 200% bad. And just to make sure you ""get"" it, there are some quick shots of ""freaks"" -- deformed people, midgets, contorted people, facial deformities. If the message is that these people are the result of the sick society in-breeding, that's bogus because at the rate this society was eating up the neighboring villagers, they hadn't had enough generations to see the impact of in-breeding to that extent. It's also fairly offensive to imply that deformities and infirmities only happen among the 'bad' people and not among the 'good people', but that message comes through. All the elderly people in Jaguar Paw's tribe, for example, appear very healthy and 'whole' with the exception of the one elder missing his right forearm. So I'm not sure why they had that other than to emphasize ""these people are bad and gross and nasty!"" But there was absolutely not one shred of humanity shown by any member of the bad society, OTHER than a scene of fatherly warmth shown when a father bestows a knife on his son with the tender words ""it's killed a lot of people"".By the same token, the ""good"" civilization is 200% good. As emphasis, we spend a lot of time with the happy villagers and their perfect wonderful peaceful loving playful coexistence. I get annoyed when filmmakers think we're so stupid they have to spell things out for us lest we miss ""oh! these are the GOOD guys!"" The tag line of the movie sort of implies that everyone is part of the Mayan civilization, and this is about the decline of that civilization. Actually, the Mayans invade the peaceful forest and kidnap the villagers and bring them in for ritual slaughter. It's more about the strong civilization invading the smaller civilization and using it for their own means. You don't see much of the Mayan civilization other than what you see in the town square as they are heading to the sacrificial altar. Mostly what *I* thought about this scene was ""they're trying to make sure you see how decadent they are in one single camera shot"" because every inch of the screen was filled with various bits of debauchery and merchandise to the point where it was completely unrealistic, people reaching out and moaning and pawing at the captives, etc. There was NO ONE in the Mayan culture who was just normal and ""there"", they were all decadent disgusting disease-ridden nut cases.Several notable lapses in continuity. We have at least three dozen villagers captured and paraded to the Mayan temple, and the men are all painted blue and marked for sacrifice. Two are sacrificed, then the rest are allowed to ""attempt"" to run free. Two die in that attempt. We follow Jaguar Paw as a third ""escapee"". We never see what happens to the rest of them.There's a scene where they are marching the captives through a previously destroyed village, and there's a dead woman with her 8 year old daughter hovering near her. The woman and the girl are covered with what appears to be smallpox. From what I remember, smallpox was brought to the new world by Europeans... and then at the end of the movie we see the first arrival of the Europeans. This entire scene could have been removed as far as I am concerned. The little girl ends up yelling some rather adult-ish rhetoric to the Mayans as they pass, way beyond her maturity level, and you're left wondering ""does smallpox make you suddenly wise beyond your years?"". Just no reason for the scene itself.Overall impressions? I thought the movie was really good, and I did not even begin to notice how long the movie was because it just flowed incredibly well. The scenes in the jungle were incredible. Even with subtitles they managed to keep your attention really well. The acting was great. The temple sacrifices were some of the best ""crowd scene"" footage I've ever seen -- looking down upon thousands of people writhing about in ecstasy, totally believable footage and incredible cinematography. I thought it was a fascinating action movie. I didn't think it was an incredible allegory about our civilization or of the past civilization. It was an action movie.",Apocalypto
825,davideiges,Has potential but doesn't get anywhere...,6,29 November 2006,"I saw a pre-screening of this movie and was quite disappointed. From the trailer I thought the movie had potential, but couldn't really see where it would go considering that there was no dialogue in the trailer. Given that, there isn't too much meaningful dialogue in the movie itself. The movie does have it's fair share of suspenseful moments, but overall I found the plot to be simplistic and in many ways absurd. At about one-third of the way through the movie people in the theater started laughing at things that were ""supposed"" to be serious but were just plain ridiculous...and by the end there were some serious moments where the theater burst out in laughter...no exaggeration...There is a fair amount of action and the cinematography is sometimes cool, but there is really no meaning to be found anywhere in this movie...",Apocalypto

That being said, the manner in which the movie portrays the sacrifices is probably fictional, as is the rest of the story, and should be taken as such.The actors in this movie are all indigenous, and are the perfect for the parts they play.(Possible spoiler)The tag line for the movie referred to the downfall of the Mayan civilization, And yet I didn't see anything about that besides the arrival of the Spanish ships. Either the ending should have been longer or that tag line removed. I generally don't like sitting in movie theaters for over an hour and a half, but as good as the movie was, I would have liked to see the ending played out a bit further.All in all a great movie!",Apocalypto
827,coldfuse-aaron,"Fantastic, remarkably fantastic.",10,8 January 2007,"I have to say that, i had not seen the passion of Christ, and in a way didn't want too. I think a sense of needless violence, to shock but also, the main subject at hand had something to do with it. As a film i am not sure if Mel Gibson has done a good job with it, what i do know however is he has done an excellent job with this film.I was hooked from the start. Characters flowed well, however accompanied with a confusing script at times with its harsh modern phrases mixed with ancient language i was seemingly interested what would become of the film.What became, was a man's struggle to find himself, which was shot and edited beautifully.AT times, Mel has used armature techniques to illustrate certain scenes. I think he must have learnt these techniques say from brave heart (some may understand) but overall it was professional, and refreshingly different.The designs of characters, scenery, are amazingly done and the grade of film was chosen beautifully.The violence, though shocking, somehow fitted with the plot and of course set in it's era, it was watch able.I am going to buy this as soon as it comes out on DVD and put it next to emerald forest. Mel you have made such a legend of a film in my eyes, can't wait for big films, which from what i have experienced you can do so well.",Apocalypto
828,carly-baldwin,To everyone who clearly MISUNDERSTOOD the ending (Spoiler),9,12 December 2006,"Gibson is not saying the Spanish saved the Mayans. Hardly! What he was depicting was that that no matter how important the internal strife of that culture may be, it was on the verge of being totally obliterated by another. The entire story of the Mayan/Aztec people that Gibson portrays here - their beliefs, human sacrifice, even Jaguar Paw's run for his life - stands on the brink of historical extinction. Once the conquistadors came, their highly evolved, complicated civilization - its beauty and its horror - will mean nothing compared to the invasion of the Europeans.Think about it: Jaguar Paw is in an intense fight for his existence and freedom against two men from practically a world away. He is running to save his family, to save his sacred way of life. They are killing him in part for revenge, in part as a religious offering - they captured him in the first place to save their sacred way of life. What do the Spanish see? Three naked Indians running together on a beach. That scene took my breath away and Gibson aptly created a pivotal point in the film.Gibson's movie is a stunning commentary on human civilization and teaches lessons we relate to today - Iraq, etc. What we, as one culture, hold so dear is utterly incomprehensible and very often meaningless to another.It would have been nice to see less gratuitous violence and more commentary on the Mayan culture. This movie should win an Oscar but it won't and, if it's because of Mel's anti-Jewish rant, I'm OK with that. Films should be rewarded for their excellence and not their creator's drunken, offensive rantings. Sometimes it's hard to see one without the other. In time, Gibson will be accepted again but he needs to pay his dues for his comments. However, everyone MUST see this movie, it's truly fantastic!",Apocalypto
829,g13005,Thank YOU!!!,10,16 December 2006,"Not to be compared to anything, anywhere, anytime..... A very good cinematic film. My mind never once wondered about, or acted confused as to purpose of the scenes being presented before my eyes. A story of this magnitude will take days and perhaps weeks to fully sink-in (maybe even years). Apocalypto helped me to better understand humanity and her true purpose. There will always be sheep and sheep herders, but it is up to each person individually to choose their destiny and live each day as it is their last! Leave your ego at the door then proceed to watch the movie! ***Notes to the reader of my comments: These words are only my current views, & perceptions thus far as I only saw the movie last night. I could care less as to what a film critic says. Their comments do not dictate the experiences I am unfamiliar with. I as do many others, understand that what is artistically expressed onto film, is simply a story as perceived through the cast & crews eyes. Films should under no circumstances be compared to books or historical accuracies/inaccuracies, especially since the writer and director may have a different perception of the story based on his/her own life experiences. If anyone from the cast or crew read this, I would just like to extend my deepest gratitude for everything that went into this film. Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.",Apocalypto
830,ginomaulucci,Well made action flick,7,27 November 2007,"I was actually expecting more from this film than it offered but what it boiled down to was an action picture. I couldn't help thinking back to Mel's Passion of the Christ. He is a phenomenal film maker, director and story teller but more as a craftsman than an artist. There are no layers of meaning or complexity, what you get is what you see. Like the Passion, it is exquisitely filmed and edited. The use of a foreign language brings a realism to the movie similar to what the Passion did. It immerses you in the experience and transports you in time.With regards to gore, I think people will feel that it's more violent than what actually appears on screen as most of the violence occurs off camera or is hidden in the frame, except for a couple of impalings done with CGI (one necessary, the other superfluous and done for fun (""Why not?"") according to the directors commentary). Pulp Fiction achieved much the same effect. It looked and felt far more gruesome than what is actually there on a frame by frame analysis. This is masterful story telling. You get so involved with the characters and the story that it's painful to watch them suffer. Compared to the appalling on frame violence in the Passion, this is far tamer by comparison. The commentary said that the torture was vastly downplayed, as hand and feet amputation, disemboweling, cauterization and skin flaying were part of the ceremony (from Aztec - Maya and Aztec are interchangeable for Mel's purposes).There are lots of fantastic Spydercam shots such as a close up of Jaguar Paw on top of the waterfall with a sweeping pan and descent revealing the height of the waterfall; and a chase scene where you get a treetop descent to the action. The camera and lighting rigs used are something else. The editing is also fantastic.The one pure delight of the movie beyond the visuals is the great acting all around by both young and old. Considering that most had never acted and they are speaking a foreign language, the results were astounding. Note that they don't consist of Mayan or Yucatan people but a cross section of aboriginal and mixed blood people from Canada, US and Mexico. Mel Gibson certainly deserves praise for his work with the actors. The casting deserves kudos for getting interesting faces and personalities.Despite the visuals and the acting, the most disappointing aspect of the film was how badly clichéd it was. It basically covered a lot of the same ground Predator did with a hunt through deep jungle. Waterfalls, rivers, mud, booby traps, .. all predictable. The chase scene is deja vu of Last of the Mohicans (which also featured the removal of a beating heart and an ""inventive"" look at aboriginal life). Like Das Boot made it the open and shut book on submarine movies, the jungle story inventions have pretty much been played out before Apocalypto came along. Even the village raid, though expertly filmed and edited, was seen before in the Mission.The story is also completely unbelievable. I can't see how someone can get shot through the guts with an arrow and run full speed for a couple of days. The wife and two kids in the chasm saved in the nick of time may add some tension to the story telling but is pure Hollywood.Whatever you may think of Mel Gibson, and his personal demons, you do have to give him his due - he is a very good director and filmmaker. He assembles a great crew and cast and took his time to craft an action chase picture.Apocalypto is a well made popcorn movie, but don't expect to walk away with a deeper understanding or appreciation of Mayan culture or insights into the human condition. Mel Gibson and Farhad Safinia's main goal was to make a good chase action picture.",Apocalypto

832,lita59,Completely false,1,3 February 2007,"I am a Mexican girl, I live here and I've studied, since elementary school, Mayan culture, as well as their art, years after at university. I just want you to know that this movie will not reflect absolutely anything of these factors, they're not true. Mayans didn't love violence nor sacrifices, actually sacrifices were voluntary and these people had an spiritual preparation before, because they were going to be at the side of gods. If you're not American, I think you will understand what I am talking about, I'm talking about Americans will always will make an adaptation of stories, cultures and facts at their convenience, just for having money. Of course they don't mind doing it because they don't have their own culture at all and they want to destroy what they don't own. There are lots of American movies talking about french, Japanese, European, and all over the world cultures and they're all completely false because they don't give a damn about other cultures. This is absolutely NOT one of the best movies ever. Or maybe it would be so, but for Americans that will always be happy with violence and distortion of a reality that they don't know. And, by the way, Mayans did not have ""strange and bizarre clothing and piercing and tattoos"". Well at least I have never seen one of them to be able to confirm it.",Apocalypto
833,richpeters_14215,Haunting,7,29 November 2006,"Just saw Apocalypto last night with a free pass ticket. Surely one of the goriest and most graphic movies ever made. In the wake of ""Passion,"" I think it's safe to opine that Mel Gibson likes to dwell on torture a bit too much, and this is my biggest reservation. Not that ""first nation"" communities in America all made nice with each other before the Europeans arrived. Of course not. There is clearly a cultural message going on, regarding violence, war, and man's inhumanity to man. I was hoping for at least some vague allusion to the Mayan/Aztec calendar, as the predictions of 2012 in the New Age community are revving up and fascinating -- but that's just my own bugaboo. Otherwise, the film-making of Apocalypto is masterful. The authenticity of the Mesoamerican depictions rivals, if not surpasses, Malick's ""New World."" The make-up and prosthetics, tattoos, scarification of the cast, as well as the overall look and texture of the movie, make for one of the most vivid and haunting movies you will ever see. Though it contains some earthy humor, this movie is definitely not for the fainthearted. It is a Class A adrenaline churner. Perhaps Gibson will redeem himself in the public eye after this work. Bound to be a blockbuster.",Apocalypto
834,nabud,"Very good, exciting, and dramatic... but...",8,30 November 2006,"I saw this today in a special screening, and I was really impressed with the overall picture. It is less of a historical film and more of an action film... with subtitles. Speaking of which, there actually wasn't very much speaking, and the subtitles didn't take away from it at all. I really enjoyed the fact that the film spends a significant amount of time with the main characters before the real action kicks in. And when it does kick in, man, it's awesome! The chase scenes and violence are the best parts of the movie, in my opinion. Not to mention the depiction of the main Mayan city. The costumes and makeup are excellent.The thing about this movie that kind of turned me off, though, was that a few plot points were pretty unrealistic. Like I turned to the person next to me and said ""come on, there's no way!"" Now, I know, I shouldn't be looking for it to be realistic, it supposedly happened over a thousand years ago, but everything else is so intense that I expected it to be. For instance, for about 30 seconds, a wounded man outruns a jaguar. That can't happen! Also, someone is being chased all night and they can't catch him, then in the morning they are still hot on his trail... in the middle of a forest! Come on! Up until these points, the movie was awesome, and I expected so much that I got disappointed when things that can't happen did.Lastly, the ending leaves something to be desired. I wanted to know what else happens. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth because it didn't end how I wanted it to end. I suppose that since it was about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, they couldn't add too much more, but whatever.Overall, I would definitely recommend it. It was a great movie, although I wouldn't go so far as to label it ""epic"" like some reviewers out there. 7/10.",Apocalypto
835,He_Goes_By_El_Tiddle,A man embarks on a mission of love in an empire torn apart by reckless hate.,7,9 December 2006,"Apocalypto is the epic tale of a man named Jaguar Paw and his struggle to get back to his wife and child after being captured by his tribe's neighbor, the now decaying Mayan Empire. This film is infamous for its unflinching depiction of the atrocities carried out by men against one another in the heat of their world's collapse. This should not be a turn-off, however. The violence is not tasteless and serves a purpose, and without it this movie couldn't sustain itself for its 2+ hours of screen time. It is alarmingly parallel to events happening in the world today, and asks the viewer to look closely at who we are and what we can do to prevent a fate as terrible as that of the Maya. The stars aren't very notable, a good move on Gibson's part to both cut cost and enhance the sense of reality. He is a master behind the camera, and easily intertwines scenes of action and humor. (Yes, the Mayans could joke with the best of 'em.) All in all I thought it was quite a show, and suggest it to anyone that would like an exotic and thrilling change of pace.",Apocalypto
836,juancqui,a good final moral,7,21 February 2007,"A good action movie that remembers the history of the Indian Mexican, tenochtitlan residents in that time, Mel Gibson, their historian, and people that says that they were Mayan, they are completely mistaken, so much from the historical point as from the social point. The Spaniards when they arrived in Mexico they found the Aztecs, the Mayan were a culture in decadence and it disperses. On the other hand the Mexican if they founded one of the biggest cities in the world based on rites of violence. The Mayan were peaceful, studious of the nature, completely unknown for the Spanish conqueror.

This POS is a misogynistic, hateful, racist attempt at brainwashing that Joseph Goebbels would be proud to show. After 20 minutes, I could not watch any more.It's not the violence that turned me off. I have no objection to violence in movies, even the now-and-then gratuitous type. It's the underlying message that Gibson, a well known ultra conservative fanatic, is trying to slide in under the radar and how he uses this particular 'story line' (which is juvenile and ridiculous) to do his dirty work.

Next thing you know, we will learn that Christ didn't invent Chairs and Tables, and Longshanks never used Prima Nocte.Bah, so apparently IMDb encourages you to be verbose, so i need to fill a few more lines of text.

Fiction missed with reality endangers people minds who are not experts on the subject. I wonder why didn't they show the real power of Maya civilization. It was not war, but mathematics, astronomy, art and religion, which was mixed with their culture, thing misunderstood by the Spanish. Why using the unjustified violence as the main characteristic of Mayans? They were not warriors.

But why are you guys so hot on violence? Because you like fear? Well for me as a German it is nearly impossible to understand why you still scared as feces because of us. The Viatnames kicked your Buttocks much harder and the Iraquis will do even more damage. But thats not the Point.....you like to be in fear, to alienate, to judge and to mettle.

We are taught in school about Mayans and Aztecs plus the invading of the Spaniards. We are given the opportunity to view for ourselves what might have taken place. The other spin is how much difference is what happened in the movie to what is happening today. one might be able to correlate today's headlines to what happened in the past; instead of Spaniards landing it could be the United States going into Iraq or Somalia, just change the time and area of the scene.",Apocalypto

The visuals are beautiful equaled only by the clever camera display in producing a truly entrenching experience. One can't help but feel supremely involved with this movie, as the viewer is lead through a vivid culture and world of which I personally believe (although perhaps not historically accurate) produced an accurate image of life and its intricacies. This film is relentless, and the violence is not easily avoided by the camera, only adding to the grasping nature of this film, as the viewer is forced, as the Mayans are, to watch the massacre and demise of there brethren, ones own visceral responses in key with those of the suffering (albeit to a much lesser degree, something conjured only within the viewers mind). The only thing that bothered me viewing this film were the immature audience members to my flank, giggling gaily at the sight of an almost bare bottom, or a partially exposed bosom. I feel the gore in this movie was appropriate given the circumstances. I mean, what would one expect from a human sacrifice? Or two people at battle? This film simply more accurately depicts the events that take place during such trying times, and it is this unrelenting quality that I believe the majority of viewers who do not like this movie are maladaptive to. Certainly worth dishing out the seven dollars to see this one, both for psychological viewers, as well as action chasers. 10/10",Apocalypto

The audience was with it the whole time, cheering, clapping, and yelling with the action. It's refreshing to see an action movie that doesn't rely on CGI. Although Gibson may be an anti-semitic moron in real life, the movie that he has brought to screen here is truly remarkable. I'm just wondering what he's going to do next to top this.

There were a few events that completely change the plot and they come from nowhere. In my opinion that sells out the previous part of the movie.

They would rape and kill the weakest, then take the strongest as captives. The women would be sold as slave labour, though the older women would be rejected, then set free. This left them alone and helpless in a world they didn't know and couldn't make a living in, so they would most likely die of starvation. The men were taken as sacrifices to the Aztec gods as a plea for mercy to relieve them of the diseases that were plaguing their homes and crops.

Willard and crew had gotten off the boat upriver then this is what they would have found - the world this film has created. But - you knew it was coming - this, like all Gibson's films, turns out to be a classic revenge flick; you know the formula: ""In which order will the bad guys die?"".

One moment that stuck me as very badly done was when a jaguar claws down a man and proceeds to maul him. All well and good except the camera stays right on the scene and the jaguar is so obviously a special effect when seen in this position that I felt to pan away would actually have made the scene more disturbing and potent due to the fact it was laughable as it stands.Didn't enjoy Passion of Christ either so maybe it's just a personal thing.

855,wwiawn,A Sweeping Epic Told Through a Narrow Lens,8,13 November 2021,"Apocalypto as a story takes place over the course of just over 3 days all in all, and follows just one character and the events he goes through during this time. These events are not even of particularly grand scope, with most of the story taking place through a small cast of characters either in a jungle village or running through that same jungle. This film that does not have a heavy focus on allegory or symbolism (the prophecy of the storyline is very contained to the story of the film rather than anything we as an audience can draw from), and you can perhaps draw some thoughts for yourself and modern day comparisons from the events but I personally didn't find this for myself.These are not criticisms however - I really don't think there is anything wrong with a film simply telling a gripping narrative with quality acting, high stakes and a huge amount of effort into the filmmaking process. Sometimes boiling a film down to its simplest points, and stripping excess, saves wasted effort or marks missed. And of course, this simplicity does make the infamous Mayan city sacrifice scene all the more stunning.That above mentioned scene is the real standout in this film. Everything building up to it, the gradual creep of civilisation and the change in the environment, is incredibly done. Then the set and the scene itself is just breathtaking in its scale and effort. This scene would not be half as quality as it is without the stripped down nature of the rest of the movie.I think what impresses me about certain Mel Gibson pieces, like this one and Passion of the Christ (not Braveheart), is the effort for authenticity. I will not say this film is historically accurate, as I have not read enough about Mayan culture to know that, but I have read about other Mesoamerican cultures to an extent to know that the city seen in the film and the outfits worn by figures in that city are a real glimpse of what this world could have looked like. And I am a firm believer that nothing immerses you like the use of an actual language (such as seen in Passion and another film not of his, Temujin), which again the use of is a testament of the effort of the film maker.All in all, I would be surprised if this was anyones favourite film. But it is a very good film, with some absolute standout scenes , and I would recommend.",Apocalypto
856,juancho_hernandez_h,The worst movie ever,1,17 January 2007,"Where in the HELL is the Maya legacy to the world?! Does Mel Gibson did some research about the Mayan culture? I don't think so. I feel sorry for ""Mr"" Mel Gibson, who doesn't know about the Latin American culture...i may not write or speak English very well, but i know my roots and that awful movie doesn't show anything about that.I can assure you that any Latin person could speak about the Maya civilization more in 5 minuets that what the movie says in 139 minuets length.Terrible story, terrible script... In my opinion it shouldn't be showed to the public, Mel Gibson should dedicate to starred again in lethal weapon and leave our culture to us",Apocalypto
857,doc_purpleman,Magua revisited?,7,11 December 2006,"I enjoyed this film, I saw a preview on 11/30. Regardless of the questions about its historic accuracy, I think it held together well as storytelling and it's a thrilling movie. There are some shortcomings, however, which were avoidable and are really inexcusable. Several scenes were pretty obviously lifted from ""Last of the Mohicans,"" including a character that is a virtual clone of ""Magua,"" the obligatory jump-over-the-waterfall scene, and the cliff-side drama. Another gripe is the really poorly done Jaguar. This clunky puppet doesn't look realistic at all and the puppeteer didn't bother to keep the animal's eyes on its prey. Indeed the eye motion even looks jerky like someone forgot to oil the mechanism. But these are relatively small problems in an otherwise outstanding film that ranks along with Gladiator, Black Robe, and not many other films in successfully bringing us on an extended journey into another place and time way beyond our comfort levels, keeping us on the edges of our seats, and alternately making us laugh, shocking us, and horrifying us, but leaving us richer for the experience. The native cast is wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful, and the editing is outstanding.",Apocalypto
858,box60706,MUCH Better Than I Expected!,9,9 December 2006,"I arrived at the theater with mediocre expectations, cringing in fact at the belief that the level of gratuitous gore (a la ""Passion"") may actually ruin any finer moments. Boy, was I wrong! The film was action-packed, gut-wrenching, and awe-inspiring. The cinematography was heart-pounding and the plot not exactly predictable. It was an excellent revenge pic, in the tradition of Unforgiven and others. While there was gore involved, I didn't find it annoying and it didn't lessen my overall excellent experience. Mel Gibson has again fashioned quite a tale and you will not be disappointed if you're a true action/history buff. From the authenticity of the Mayan dialogue to the complexity and detail of the costumes and backdrops, it was every voyeur's dream. Mel may not be a great guy...but he can make quite a movie!",Apocalypto
859,mouthbreather76,Entertaining but completely fictional view the Maya civilization,5,11 January 2007,"No doubt Mel Gibson is a talented actor and director. Unfortunately, just as with Passion of the Christ, it is obvious that he has let his religious convictions spill over into his film making. The the overall theme was, the Maya were mindless, bloodthirsty heathens, incapable of managing their society. The factual flaws in the film concerning the Maya are without number. With all the resources the producers had it would have been great to see a film about Maya culture that was educational and historically accurate. Instead it gives the impression of film created by a religious fanatic attempting to show the barbaric, wanton lifestyle of ignorant natives and casts a very negative, condescending view on an entire race of people. Despite these drawbacks I will say it was well filmed, and the costume design though inaccurate, was impressive. I might have enjoyed it it was about a fictional civilization but I couldn't get over seemingly intentional misrepresentation of an impressive, advanced real life culture.",Apocalypto
860,slovinsky,"An iconic film, thematically akin to The Odyssey's restoration of the household.",10,11 December 2006,"Without doubt, this is Mel Gibson's most fully realized and satisfying film. Yes, it is hardly perfect: it allows coincidence to move along the plot at crucial junctures, and on occasion strains the imagination. How could the characters do what we see on the screen, given the era and physical constraints, you ask yourself. But viewed in totality, it is a superb and breathless action picture, punctuated by violence where violence is clearly called for. The acting, mostly by non-actors, is credible: by turns comedic, thoughtful, and wise. The location, action, sets and costumes are ultra realistic. Shot for shot, Apocalypto is relentlessly lush, saturated with color and palpable atmosphere, but it is not sentimental; one feels the characters' fear and pain, the blood of elemental Darwinism. The jungle, at once beneficent and oppressive, will, we know, help conquer Mayan hegemony, but the cycle of violence is poised to be replaced with even greater violence. Apocalypto is an iconic film, full of archetypes and historical tropes, much like Homer's Odyssey, which is also about restoring the household. Only Gibson has made it more relevant to our time.",Apocalypto
861,ryandaniels-19483,Movie Night Pick! (Subtitles),8,24 January 2021,I've watched this movie a number of times since the first time I discovered. I always recommend people to stick with it as the beginning can be a bit much... and the middle...and the end lolIt practically goes from 0-70 and doesn't let up until the final scene. You're able to feel the emotions of the characters and not knowing the language being spoken creates a deeper connection.Thanks Mel Gibson for this delightful story.,Apocalypto

Gibson for making me do nightmares, and take pills of Xanax to calm down from all the anxiety this film caused in me.Thank you very much for bringing such fear I didn't want in my life. This film should have been banned. I've never ever in my life seen such free cruelty on the screen. Thank you again for not showing it on the trailer, so that people couldn't know in advance it's much more than an ""action"" movie... it's a butchery. I hope Mel Gibson does ""sweeter"" next time, or else I'll think twice before watching his movie. I really don't advise this film to anyone, it will traumatize you. I really found that movie useless, and much more than a waste of time... a total lack of respect towards the audience's eyes. What's the point of making a whole film about violence? It's completely inhuman!!! Totally lacking of sensitivity, describing the wonderful Maya civilization as prehistoric people just made for hunting, killing and reproducing!",Apocalypto

It is nothing but a string of scenes featuring savages and savagery, each becoming more implausible as the movie goes on. Yes, the cinematography is good, but overshadowed by the movie's lack of purpose. I can't understand those who thought the movie was ""action-packed."" I for one was bored, waiting for some sort of point to the movie (no pun intended). And the CG ending with ships in the distance was sooooo CG.And then, after reading others' reviews of the movie, I find it's historically inaccurate to boot.Such a waste of time!",Apocalypto

The only thing I didn't like was 16-24 hours long chasing ( wounded boy escaping followed by the enemy ) Its probably impossible to run 20 hours long, especially wounded. (By the way meanwhile the rolling blood drop on the leaf was one of the highlights of the movie) I can't mention any other mistake of the director. Characteristic performers, original language, beautiful landscapes, historical authenticity. Shocking imagery of human emotions like pain. Shocking imagery of the cruel side of human beings. Many say this movie is about religion. I say this movie is about much more. 40 million dollars invest - I think it was worth it. After watching this, you have to think about some things.",Apocalypto

Mhm...I didn't expect anything and I didn't get anything. OK, blood and death everywhere. Well, why not? But a real plot? As for me, there was none.The only thing I saw was a bunch of Maya killing each other. That's like ancient reality TV, nothing else.We tried to count the number of people who died in the movie. We surrendered after 60 minutes. The cruelty and violence that is shown in the movie is in some ways really amusing. The whole cinema laughed at some scenes (ok, about 10 people who made it into the movie). I guess the kill rate was 2 people all 15 minutes.I think a new award should be created. It should be named ""The Gibson"". It should be an award for incomparable violence, blood and ways how to kill people shown in a movie.Thanks for your attention! I hope you could read my English properly!",Apocalypto

Despite the bloody scenes and the depiction of the Maya civilization as a rather aggressive and primitive culture, I have to say that one can take better messages out of this movie.For me, it was the strength of LOVE that saves us at the end of the day, the thought that even if we, humans, can be very destructive, there will always be strong people in this world to carry on with hope. I found the end of the film very positive with the sight of the whole family heading towards a better place and world.Watching Jaguar Paw's race to go back to his family, made me cringe couple of times, being completely caught in the action. I consider Mel Gibson a genius of a director, his views are always different. I might be wrong, but I am totally engaged with his directorial style. Wish he could have a better attitude regarding certain beliefs he exposed some time ago....I truly recommend this movie, it will take you out of this world completely for two hours, making you introspect about many things.",Apocalypto

First off, what kind of a cruel world do we live in that allows Mel Gibson to make historic or cultural films? Politics aside, Gibson's representation of the Mayan peoples is so faulty, I don't even know where to begin. I think he must have gotten them confused with the Aztecs. I'm an anthropology major at University of Michigan, admittedly, Mayan culture is a little out of forte, but I will say this: -Much of this movie is filmed in Guatemala, pawning it off as Mexico. -This movie contains a lot of gratuitous violence, and Mayan descendant will surely by offended by the the level of violence in for which this film indites them.

It's not in English, but that makes the movie only more atmospheric. The movie doesn't lose it's dynamic being always intense and often violent, so it's a treat to watch.

Mel Gibson did such a great job on the cast, the set, everything was really a work of art. Most of the actor's in this film are completely unknown, and only speak Mayan. I had kind of thought about going because of the violence that was shown, but there are many films that are much more gruesome. The violence was also done as an art. I would highly recommend this film to anyone, your in for a ride. You can see the passion in this project that all crew had while filming it was very evident this subject was highly researched and tried to be true to. Once again this is not a historic film.",Apocalypto
871,rdemascal,The Ghost of Cities Past,8,24 December 2006,"We do not see the fall of the Mayan civilization in this film, but we do see that the check is in the mail. For what feels like only a split-second, we peak through the screen into Central America 1100 years ago. And wow! What a view! We see the foreshadowing of several current theories explaining Mayan decline: 1) climatic changes that may have been affecting the crops and water supplies of the cities; 2) epidemic diseases that could have been taking out the people and their livestock; 3) unrest of the lower classes as evidenced by the priest seemingly more concerned about appeasing the masses of people than the god he was honoring; and 4) (would be spoiler here.)The city is juxtaposed by the paradise of the jungle. The small tribes of hunters and gatherers in the jungle respect the forest and every living being, whereas the Mayans from the city exploit the plants, animals, and people. We see the hunters find food, water, medicines and first aids, and all kinds of really cool tools in the jungle. We see the humans from the city do every horrible thing imaginable, from cutting down 1000-year old trees, to raping, enslaving, and murdering people.If you - the reader - know nothing else about Mayans, you probably know two things: they practiced human sacrifices, and their entire civilization mysteriously disintegrated. The second fact has probably made you briefly curious...maybe even momentarily sad...Watch this film, and you might think they had it coming. At least, that's what I think the filmmakers were trying to say.Technically speaking - so far as I can tell, anyway - the film is magnificent. I was swept away with the audiovisual effects. Prior to the raid on the village, the incessant dog barking (always a clue ignored by movie characters) pervaded me with anxiety. Of course, tribal drums aren't very calming sound effects, either. The camera stayed uncomfortably close to the actor's faces, and I was uncomfortable - as anyone shackled and led down a corridor toward a temple shrinking into a stack of decapitated bodies would be. The chase segment was so thrilling I wanted to get up and run with Jaguar Paw.My only criticism about this film is the fact that from isolated tribe to isolated tribe to big city folk, they were all speaking the same language. I read somewhere there were about 30 different Mayan languages. Now I don't know for sure, but I'd be willing to bet that if Tribe A grows up in Jungle Section A and spends a few generations there, never knowing about the existence of Tribe B, and never venturing into Section B, when they do, the two tribes would at least have different dialects. I expect some difficultly in expressing much more than ""I bring you fish, not fight. I go through, not stay."" But that's just nitpicking, isn't it?See this movie.",Apocalypto

The acting is merely decent and the only emotions seen are despair. The dialogue is terrible- the entire movie is subtitled by the way- and more representative of 21st century English rhetoric than how I would assume ancient Mayan rhetoric was. The first hour is painfully slow and as usual for Mel Gibson movies, the second drawn out and pointless hour is disturbingly gory. There is no plot or character development and the movie has no point nor relevance to the title until the end. I will not spoil the ending, but it truly displays Mr. Gibson's feelings about what should happen to the entire non-white, non-Christian world.

Even worse, it portrays the Maya people as exoticized bloodthirsty savages; only war and sacrifice are emphasized to any significant degree.

This movie is not only unsubstantiated by any archaeological evidence, or otherwise, it leads viewers to see the Maya of the past as little more then blood thirsty savages that killed for entertainment. I watched this with a professor of Maya archaeology, in her opinion this does little to prove that Mel Gibson is not the racist he made himself out to be. There is scant evidence of the kind of sacrifice depicted in the film, and there has definitely never been a pit of hundreds of sacrificed bodies discovered. There is no evidence that Mel Gibson did any research outside of looking at picture books, if even that. There is no proof of tattoos, no proof of that level of piercing, and the Maya were as my professor put it ""So clean they hardly left dust for us to find.""

I think Gibson's epic tale of our hero's DAY contains more than we could've imagined but stays within the realms of what may have occurred.As for the characters and the acting the casting crew makes the whole thing transform into something only true artists can achieve, and thats making you feel that the camera doesn't exist! if you have seen ""A time for drunken horses"" or ""Seven samurai"" you'll know what i mean.Gibson's thin red line of letting epic tale's about ancient people talk their native and mostly extinct language is outstanding.

Nothing gory like the ""REJECTS"" but its' graphic content serves to carry a message, to put the viewer in a certain perspective that is masterful, it places you inside the scene, you suffer, you sweat, you are close to death. At times it becomes a bit ""RAMBESQUE"" but if you consider the big picture (no pun intended!) you understand each character's actions and reasoning. The end is what one expects but the journey there is marvelous. The setting is beautiful, the extras are many, the society portrayed, not created, by Gibson is one of documentary accuracy, even the language. It would be great to see Mel tackle Egypt, maybe even the ROMAN EMPIRE. It is a given that some people are mad at Gibson and some may decide to boycott his movie.

887,luke-493,You're not a Mayan are you?,1,11 December 2006,"What are the unforgivable sins of movie making? Well, Gibson has made the demo movie. Mayan culture, accomplishments, civilization - these are worthwhile themes for a gala movie. Throw in some blood, gore, and an outstanding warrior culture and it could have been great. Gibson, alas, leaves out the civilization, culture, accomplishments -- architecture, astronomy, agriculture, hydraulic engineering. He doesn't even get the warrior culture right. Instead we get trite clichés - a little girl with smallpox (How did she get that?) who for some unexplained reason begins predicting the future - and is never heard from again. Trite? Clichéd? Let's use the old solar eclipse stunt to rescue our putative hero from cardiac surgery al fresco and the famous rolling head trick. What's worse than T&C? Well - insulting your characters and your audience by assuming they're stupid is right up there in my book. The stupid characters meet people fleeing from terror and don't even bother to ask for the details about their terrorists. Just how stupid do people have to be to not post any kind of guards around their village? Well, so stupid they don't even pay attention when their guard dogs start barking. Skipping over the Hidden Family in The Well trick, I'll just go straight to the pre-Columbian superman stunts. Nah, just thinking about it makes regret again actually paying to see this movie. Let's put it this way - our hero runs a major league marathon, spiced by creative killing of pursuers, after a major fight and grueling ordeal, near sacrifice, and then being shot through with an arrow that passes through areas normally occupied by the kidney and intestines not to mention the interesting muscle groups that had to be cut. This is the director treating the audience as stupid. And it just goes on and on like that. The ultimate insult though, may have been too subtle for most. The opening theme is that for a civilization to fall to external forces it must first destroy itself from within. The human sacrifices, the violence, the outlandish tattoos and customs of the people, these are the faults of that civilization. The apocalypse, the new beginning, manifests in the final frames when the aboriginal savages encounter, and are awed by, the sailing ships and landing craft of the Christian Spaniards complete with their crosses and missionaries.

889,ribhouseriot,Excellent movie!,8,9 December 2006,"The Mayan culture is such a mystery to me. I read it over and over in history classes, but it feels regurgitated to me the same way over and over. Gibson's vision of the tribes conveyed through his artistic impression shines a fresh light on the subject, one I wouldn't have otherwise gone out of my way to research. Now maybe I'll look it up some more. Points for instilling in me some motivation.I laughed so much at the beginning my face hurt. And later on throughout the movie I was caught up in the intensity, my interest piqued all the way. I haven't seen the Passion movie yet, but I enjoyed the genuine language usage in this film so much I'll give the Aramaic a try.When I left the theater, my face still hurt. I think 8/10 is a decent score, that is certainly how my face feels. Subtitles sent the messages, talent played their roles superbly, and I appreciate the effort of the whole crew used in making this film.",Apocalypto
890,koktan,"Excellent, breathtaking movie",10,9 December 2006,"Nice historic display of civilization and human nature. Great photography with no overblown effects. It is very nice once in a while to catch a movie that is visually pleasing (and I don't mean the violence) and shot without CGI, or let's just say excessive CGI, because even though there is no high tech effects, I'm sure CGI cannot be avoided this day and age.The story is told in a very good balance of picture and words, you don't find yourself having to read subtitles all the time (unless you speak Yukatek Maya language :)) Movie has very violent and disturbing images, however when put in context, you end up accepting it as a part of life.I thank Mel Gibson for making this excellent movie that has history, action and nature presented in this breathtaking motion photography.",Apocalypto
891,jlemonds03,An Open Letter to Mel Gibson,6,9 December 2006,"Dear Mel Gibson, After seeing your movie Apocalypto and reflecting on your approach to Mayan history, I have to say that you are ONE SICK PUPPY! What happened Mel? Was your sadistic appetite not fully satisfied after filleting Jesus and sending him through a cheese grader in THE PASSION OF THE Christ? Did you really have to make another 2 hour film about mutilation and animal torture? Do you get off on watching people decapitate each other after they eat pig testicles? In addition to you being a sadistic freak, I have to say you are a horrible historian. I don't think you could pass my 7th grade unit on Mayan civilization with the kind of crap you put in Apocalypto. Here's a short list of critical errors to help correct some of your poorly researched Mayan facts.#1. Mayan cities were empty for over 500 years before the Spanish arrived. Do your homework Mel! #2 The Spanish were NOT heroes. Christians did not rescue the Maya and other Meso-American peoples. Your film suggest that had not Christianity and Spanish culture been introduced to Mexico, the Aztec, Maya, and others would have continued slitting each others throats for sport and laughing at the sight of spilled blood.#3 The Maya were the finest astronomers of their time. They developed a sophisticated calendar and were able to predict an eclipse 1000 years into the future with a margin of error of only 14 seconds. In Apocalypto, during the eclipse scene, all the Maya freak out when they see an eclipse. You made them look like retarded cavemen seeing fire for the first time. Shame on you Mel.#4 The Maya on Maya violence was completely over-blown. Yes, the Maya fought civil wars; yes, the Maya practiced slavery; and yes, the Maya carried out human sacrifice. You have taken these negative traits and multiplied by 1000X. Your scenes of Mayan slave trading were unjustifiably more disturbing than the African Slave Trade scenes in AMISTAD and ROOTS. Your human sacrifice scenes with bodies piled in the thousands were more brutal than the Holocaust images in SCHINDLERS LIST. (The lady behind me in the theater was dry heaving).I could go on but the point has been made. Look, I loved MAD MAX, the ROAD WARRIOR, BRAVEHEART, but you've gone too far with APOCALYPTO. Mayan civilization ended for many reasons, mainly environmental mismanagement, and you chose to choose one negative aspect of all civilizations, violence, and magnify it 1000X to make the Maya look like savage headhunters. This was the same argument Spain used for over 500 years to turn Mexico into their own personal piggy bank. Its obvious you share this opinion and have no qualms about making millions of dollars off it. How about donating the films proceeds to the Maya living in Guatemala today who have suffered because of the nonsense ideology and theology your film subscribes to. I won't hold my breath. I don't expect it from a person like you. After seeing this film I hope people around the world we see you for what you are: a RACIST. Mel, your film is RACIST and so are you. Shame on you!",Apocalypto
892,lokiband5,awesome,10,9 December 2006,"As an anthropologist and archaeologist, i found this movie to be amazing. Historically, it is very accurate. it never mentioned why the sacrifices were occurring. As a student of history, i knew that the sacrifices were a offering to the gods that were angry and were punishing the Mayans. By offering the captured men, they gave a solution to the ecological problem of depleted resources, famine and disease. I like how Mel Gibson threw his main character into the middle of the macro level cultural problem. Also, Mel Gibson did not hold back on the blood and gore of the expected warfare. I felt this was crucial in giving a cohesive feel for the Mayan sacrifice.",Apocalypto
893,alkjunebug,Let down,4,9 December 2006,"I saw the movie, and thought it was relatively well done,even though there was some gore and shocking scenes that were NOT necessary. I know that it was a very violent time, but some of the bloody scenes would have been better left unshown. It lost my vote at the end. When the ships came with the priest and the Spanish was completely ridiculous. First of all, what is Mel trying to say? That the white man came and saved the poor Indian right before his death? No way. I really did not like the ending, it was ridiculous and you can definitely see how Mel felt. True, he tried to cover it by not showing what happened after the Spanish invaded, and even made the main character aware of something wrong with the conquistadors, but there was still the underlying message, in my opinion, that white man saved the day. Im not bashing Mel, I'm bashing the movie, it was overly gory and the end really sucked, no way around it.",Apocalypto
894,piacovazzo,Apocalypto,10,9 December 2006,"Mel Gibson is just brilliant. The cinematography is so artful. The actors looked so authentic and acted so naturally and brilliantly. I have been to the Mayan sites and pyramids and I felt I was reliving that experience. The film really transports you.It is a pity that people are trying to boycott Mel... the theater was pretty empty on the 2nd day of screening and this truly is a must see movie.Just loved this film. Unique, natural and brilliant acting - gorgeous settings... film was not overdone.I recommend this film. Just a beautiful film that explains part of the Mayan civilization and shows the brutality of that time.The actors were so well cast...",Apocalypto
895,amayesing32,"Good, but...",8,9 December 2006,"I just saw Apocalypto and I have to say I was impressed. The scenery, the costumes, the language, the jewelry. I have spent a lot of time in Mexico and seen a lot of ruins and museums....I have to give Mel props for doing so much research and making it visually accurate. This is the first movie to be about Mesoamerica that didn't involve white people and I think it was out standing.HOWEVER, this movie is supposed to be about Mayans, right? Well, Mayan civilization had already fallen before the arrival of white people. so, that little inaccuracy really bugged me. I mean if you are going to go to all the trouble of making a historically accurate movie then why would you flub something as major as the actual timing of events?It was also unnecessarily violent, but definitely a thrill ride. My heart was pumping and it was definitely worth seeing in the theaters. And Rudy Youngblood is HOT!!",Apocalypto
896,patrickvalvarez,oh my god!,10,9 December 2006,"Mel if you weren't so Christian, I would have to worship you.. This movie was unbelievable!!! One of the best movies I have seen, on the big screen, in my lifetime! The accuaracy, the content, the camera angles! This is why you do what you do. You stay true to the art of film-making. The only reason why I am writing this review is because when I left the movie theatre, I heard someone say that this was the worst movie they had seen. I couldn't believe my ears. Then it hit me. How ignorant people could be. oh, almost forgot. When I was looking for the movie times, I saw an ad, or rather a bash about how violent it was. Mel, I think you wheren't violent enough. The things I used to read about the Aztecs and their way of life are pretty explicit. I couldn't believe how ignorant someone could be. You show them the truth and they will do anything just to sound sophisticated, in the eyes of their peers, to a point where they ignore history. GOOD JOB!!! Ladies in gentlemen, Thats how you make films.. Simply Accurate.. He just picked an unusual topic. :)",Apocalypto
897,statecollege1855,Give this movie a chance! Don't let your feelings toward Mel Gibson affect you from seeing this movie.,10,9 December 2006,"Give this movie a chance! Don't let your feelings toward Mel Gibson affect you from seeing this movie... This movie is set in the dying Mayan culture of 15th-century Mexico, it opens with a series of scenes that depict tribal life in one village and establishes its inhabitants as being people pretty much like ourselves, with basically the same social concerns, family problems and sexual insecurities. From there, the script focuses on one young captive warrior, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), and the movie becomes his survival story as he endures a gantlet of ordeals in an impossible quest to return to the decimated village and rescue his imperiled family.",Apocalypto
898,woodkamania,great visuals but story is layed out improperly,4,10 December 2006,"this movie sucked, story was inaccurate. people are going to think this is all real but he mixed Mayan and Aztec things throughout the movie.these are just a couple of things wrong with this movie.first of all the Mayans didn't really sacrifice people and when they did they sacrificed their own. they weren't savage warriors like the Aztecs. Aztecs did capture others and sacrifice them by the thousands at a time.second of all a jaguar isn't black, its spotted like a leopard. i know there are black melanistic jaguars but the ones worshipped by the Mayans were spotted.the movie skipped days at a time, jaguar paw was getting chased by the Mayans then it turned into night, next scene its day and hes still getting chased. he was also injured but that didn't seem to stop him whatsoever, he didn't seem to have any moments of weakness.the scene with the woman and her son was unrealistic,s something like that would take hours to happen no matter how much rain is pouring down. plus when she ""delivered"" that wasn't believable.Mayans also never had direct contact with the ""foreigners"" that were shown at the end, while they were still a great civilization. the contact they had was 600 years later when they were basically just nomads.overall this movie very SLOPPY, if they wanted to show this time and a real fall of a great civilization they should have gone with the Aztec angle. it also had a love story (cortez/malinche) that would have flowed better than the love story they tried to shove down our throats plus there was an actual fall of a great civilization. in this movie only jaguar paws tribe has a downfall. the implication they give at the end with the ""foreigners"" gives a bitter sweet taste.this movie dragged on too long cuz they didn't know what angle to take, mel totally dropped the ball on this one. but i guarantee the casual fan that doesn't know the history will enjoy it very much. me on the other hand, unfortunately cant fathom this debacle.",Apocalypto
899,Steve-S-Garcia,Mayan first,10,10 December 2006,"I saw this film last night and despite Gibson's lack of social skills, have to commend him on his continued passion to make movies which takes his film-goers to times and places, which most film-makers are afraid or too apathetic to go. There are many stories yet to be told about the many places and cultures found on this small planet, and my biggest criticism of film-makers is their lack of originality- versus content. This movie could win movie of the year simply on originality- versus cultural importance. This film-like ""The Passion"", will force those that don't want to face actual history- versus recorded history, to accept that there does exist on this planet, a few brave visionaries that can envision an actual history.",Apocalypto
900,matthewkeithallred,don't sleep,10,10 December 2006,"I just got home from the theatre and the glow and awe one gets as the credits roll following good film wont go away. I need somebody to talk to about this film. Next best thing is to blog it up I suppose. Apocalypto might be my new favorite film.Anyone who sits through this film and comes away critiquing its message - likely missed the point.No this film is not simply about one man trying to save his family.Yeah, thats the filler. Thats what keeps you in your seat. You invested some emotions in your protagonist or whatev. Basic story telling. Mel Gibson knows this and uses it to his advantage very well.In all fairness, I do not claim to know what or if Mr. Gibson had some underlining theme or message he wanted to share with his viewers except the bold title: APOCALYPTO.Duh -this film is about humanity and the ugly depths to which the human experience repeatedly visits. Choosing the Mayan culture as a stepping stone for such a message was well thought out and proved to be beautifully poetic. Not to mention, the treat of getting submersed in pre-colonist native American cultures that are otherwise largely discarded from film was refreshing. Mr. Gibson could have named it 'Watch Indian Run' - if that was the big idea. No, Mel Gibson should be heralded as an intellectual who time and time again passionately puts his soul into his work. An artist with an agenda can be a powerful thing. Not that his agenda is perfect or his personal worldview better than anyone else's, but I tip my hat to him for trying and in my personal opinion doing an excellent job.I was entertained. I digested the message - of which i readily agree with, namely that more harm can be done to society from within than from some outside menace. When the fabric decays, a society well past its prime can be conquered with the slightest nudge. I will say however, that some of the gore was a bit much for my taste, but on the other hand I thankfully don't have to witness such realistic violence in real life. Its just a 2 hour film. A historical fiction, where the history is more likely than not terribly accurate. People bleed. Blood is red. Heads bounce. And when the lust, pride, and otherwise lack of reverence for life infects a society, I don't doubt it will happen again. And Mel would likely say that said society was already past due for the fall.All in all, a great film. One of the best.",Apocalypto
901,janagenelly,I was emotionally invested,9,10 December 2006,"Having read the reviews from multiple sources I was ready to be grossed out. I was surprised that the violence and blood were not at all more than necessary for the telling of the story. Great chase movie with many, many messages, not at all disjointed as many critics wrote. Made me wonder if they watched with an open mind or with another agenda. The cinematography is beautiful. The story is very easy to understand even with subtitles, I even think it is better having been done in the language of the time. Having no known movie stars also was/is good in that there are no distractions from the story. I love this film and would recommend it highly to everyone. I think Mr. Gibson did an excellent job of storytelling, and isn't that what movies are all about ?????!!!!",Apocalypto
902,jkuhn4-1,See This Movi / 5 Stars,10,11 December 2006,"This is the best movie of the last 5 years. Don't believe the ""its just blood & violence crowd"". Mel Gibson has never been politically correct so the pc crowd dislike him. This is movie is about good vs. evil. The family struggle. Enjoy this film & judge for yourself. The next time you here someone say its just violence, tell them to shut up & go see it, it has no more violence than casino royal the new bond flick. As usual this will get no Oscars even though its 10 times better than the propaganda trash the rest of Hollywood spews out. It is refreshing to see new actors & actresses, outstanding use of film. Keep it up Mr. Gibson. Someday you will replace the obsolete worn out Hollywood.",Apocalypto
903,Provenbnyce,Great Movie,10,10 December 2006,"This movie is awesome. The story line is incredible, and the realism and accuracy of the Mayan sacrificial ceremonies are stunning. Despite the graphic images the movie does a great job in grasping the audience, while maintaining an honest accurate position. All of the actors are phenomenal, and the constant chases keeps the audiences puzzled and on their toes like great movies are supposed to do. The natural language gives great realism. Most of the messages could be seen through facial expressions. The relationship between father and son is powerful. This statement could only be understood in a deeper context. The movie was hard to watch during some of the violent scenes, however the depiction of the Mayan sacrifices are true, and despite the pointless violence we may believe Mel added, his depictions were very accurate. The movie may give Mayan's a bad reputation, however the enslavement and sacrifices were key to keeping their god's content, and building their buildings and temples. The main character's will to survive is incredible, during the movie you feel as if he will find his demise and it constantly forces yourself feel his pain. I'm scared this movie will not do so well simply because it may not interest many people, however it will certainly be a movie that is worth admission and may be a hit for rental similar to Pirates of the Caribbean 1. Mel Gibson's best movie by far, 10 stars.",Apocalypto
904,epw4,zzzzz,1,10 December 2006,"When I first saw the trailer for Apocalypto I was excited, there were some beautiful shots and it looked like the film itself was going to be exciting. Unfortunately the shots in the trailer were the best in the film and it was anything but exciting. I have to say that it was historically accurate or at least plausible until the very end but other than that there are really no positive points. The one point in the movie where special effects were obviously used looks so unrealistic that I laughed out loud. The plot focused not on the downfall of Mayan civilization but on the journey of one man, this is all well and good but it is stretched out so long that by the end instead of waiting to see what happened I was just waiting for the end of the movie. After Passion of the Christ I thought that Mel Gibson couldn't possibly make a worse film, I gave him a second chance and it turns out that I was wrong. Thanks Apocalypto, those are two and a half hours that I'll never get back!",Apocalypto
905,bea_186,The real message of the movie...my opinion...,7,11 December 2006,"Well there's something about the previous comment that I believe to be misinformed. When he says: The ending disappoints in that it introduces an outside element to this previously enclosed world, and the ending can't resolve the movie's basic dilemma: how can it be both the story of a civilization's decline and also the story of a man's personal triumph.Well the ending IS precisely the decline of a civilization, that is the irony of the movie, all this time Mayans are trying to preserve their culture by making sacrifices but in the end the Spaniards came to conquer...and that is the real end of their civilization once they conquered the tortures and assassinations were even worst than what you saw in the movie.This is the real message of the movie the man's personal triumph is a secondary message. In fact their is no personal victory or gain because the fact that the Spaniards arrived is a given that not even the main character will survive. Mel Gibson's achievements strive in that he is a director that conveys the message very subtly. You must understand history facts to understand the real message of his movies. And that is what a good director does, he doesn't tell you through his main character's dialogues or silly voice overs, he SHOWS you the message through visuals and lets you draw your own conclusion.

906,WSofH,Almost an epic.,7,11 December 2006,"This movie was quite entertaining. I truly cannot see its deep metaphor, nor its extreme adrenaline rush, i don't see it as much of anything really. I think its greatest strenght is its ability to look bigger than what it really is. You would think this is a 100 million dollar movie, but if you really, i mean really think about it... you don't have to spend that much money to tell this guy to run for an hour and a half on screen. Anyways, its not that violent or brutal, its funny sometimes, pretty entertaining, don't get critical though, or the flaws will just come at you like there's no tomorrow.",Apocalypto
907,claireedix,Campy Mel set in Latin America,2,11 December 2006,"I thought this movie was horrible. It has these little campy, cutesy scenes but this is supposed to be some kind of epic movie. I just thought it was going to be a serious movie about the breakdown of civilization. Instead it was some one liners and weird camera angles. I thought some scenes ran long for the sake of running long. The length of the scenes did not intensify the movie - it made it boring. It could have been cut down a whole lot more than it was.Then there is all the gore and violence in the movie for the sake of being gross. Sometimes I was sitting there thinking - Mel just wanted to see if he could gross someone out here. It was just stupid violence. I am not apposed to violence in movies if it pertains to the story. The violence in this movie was just weird and gross. I felt like it was done improperly.It is a pretty movie to watch but as far as content goes - it blows.",Apocalypto
908,benrugo,Over the Top as Usual,2,11 December 2006,"Though not a fan of Gibson, I have been intrigued for many years by the Mayan culture. I went to see what Gibson could do with that. I wanted to cry in the movie, not because of all the blood and guts, heaven knows the Mayans were known for that. No, I wanted to cry because Gibson focused on the vilest and not the most beautiful aspects of the Mayan culture. Can the guy read? Or is he only into sensationalism. The Maya were very advanced in their understanding of astronomy, and Gibson even made a huge mistake in that regard. The filming of the jungle and environment was gorgeous, and the actors were excellent. Too bad they weren't given a real story to portray. I have been to the Yucatan and many ruins there. I will have to go back to take the bad taste out of my mouth.",Apocalypto

I would like to go see this again because i just loved so very much. Mel Ginson made a very great movie for us. The actors were great too. Some i knew from Spanish shows. It was a smart, funny, heart thumping and great detailed movie. the ideas and Special effects were just VERY good work and...i just LOVED IT. I really want to go see it again. Mel Gibson was just really smart about this movie. He chose a lot of great actors. My whole family loved it and said that is was very good. and the foreign language was interesting. and by that i mean great. I never really thought of a movie about the Maya civilization. Yet this movie made me think a lot about the stuff that the people did to the Indians. I thought it was wrong to just take over the land that they had already owned. And again, i just really love this move and i thought it is very great.",Apocalypto

It is extremely disturbing and painful to watch especially if you have young children of your own at home. I think this is one of Mel's worst films personally and thanks to the movie theater for refunding my money....they certainly didn't have to. The level of violence was really unnecessary to make the points he was trying to make. The technical ability of Mel is without a doubt top rate. I generally like Mel's movies, even ones others have criticized before but this one I just couldn't stomach. The make-up and scenery was top-notch.",Apocalypto
911,ilovemykittiealot,Acrapalypto,1,13 December 2006,"Mel Gibson's new motion picture, Apocalypto, focused on a tribe of indigenous Americans around the 1490's, is the worst movie I have ever seen. Hands down. The first five minutes of this movie promptly grabbed a shovel, dug for a while, then jumped right in to it's own grave. It jumped back and forth from trying to be a weighty, bloated, concept-based, focus-lacking dramatic crapsterpiece to an illiterate, juvenile, half-witted comedy almost national-lampoon's in nature. By the time I came to this conclusion, I hadn't even finished my $5 icee. I stayed in the theater purely to see if the movie would get any better. It didn't. Plot holes bigger than the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, gratuitous, unnecessary violence and a horrible plot plagued and scoured this film to no end. This seems to be Passion's inbred, alcoholic, community-college attending cousin who was sat in a room and made to stay awake for days while being forced to watch Reservoir Dogs, documentaries on the Amazon, and The Lion King. Then, before being allowed to go sleep, was told to make a movie.The biggest problem I had with it is that it could have been great. I'm not going to sit here and pretend like I know how to create a movie into a work of art or that I could have done a better job. I'm just saying that Pauly Shore probably could have.The second biggest problem I had was the absolutely terrible plot. To just give an example, in one scene in the film, the protagonist's pregnant wife and their child are in a small well-type cave and it has been raining on them for at least 2 minutes, so, of course, the cave is filling rapidly up with water, threatening to drown the mother and her son. While she is busy trying to keep both of them alive and afloat, she gives birth. That's right, up to her neck in water, after three seconds of labor, while holding another child, she gives birth. Underwater. The baby lives. The most bizarre thing about this, however, is that this is not unusual when compared to the rest of the film.I am not even going to start on the amateurish cinematography or the pointless violence that didn't even have a place in this film. I will let them be and try to be positive. I think that some good could come out of this film, however bleak that prospect may be. Maybe this will be the turning point for people in America, to help them realize that, although someone like Mel Gibson may be a bona-fide star and talented actor, being a celebrity does not make you a any less fallible than anyone else. And it sure as hell doesn't make you a genius.",Apocalypto

Mel Gibson did an awesome job at directing this film. It was well detailed and so accurate. I sat there and was like ""I know that from my history classes"". I love how he used all new faces, these young actors were amazing. It's times like this I wish I was a movie critic because I would have made the world want to see this movie. I'm so at a lost for words. It was a brilliant piece. Well done Mel!! It's not everyday one gets to see a masterpiece and that is what Apocalypto is, a brilliant masterpiece. If I could I would make sure they walked away with Oscars under every category. Hats off to everyone involved in it's production.

The last 1/3 was experienced as the typical movie, its still enjoyable and entertaining.The level of violence is high but did not bother me as much since I had heard it was bloody, and to me it was not as gratuitous as many action movies.The two things that bothered me were the omen and that I could not understand how some characters could possibly follow a character in a Jungle pursuit.Good movie overall and quite original.",Apocalypto
914,pnorman86,Poorly made waste of time,1,14 December 2006,":::SPOILERS CONTAINED:::this movie is quite possibly the worst movie i have seen in the past few years. I saw hostel, walked out, and still liked it more that this movie. the only reason i stayed was because my ride home didn't want to waste their money, I still think we all did. that being said here's my review.The whole move has been billed as a gore fest but a wonderfully filmed masterpiece. this simply is not the case. the first half of the move is decent enough, ball jokes and penis jokes and a decent set up for what this tribe is, a peaceful group of people. then we have the evil people tat are so evil they seem to not have any decency in them. they are so stereotypical that, as another reviewer put it so perfectly, ""if there had been mustaches there would have been twisting."" the first half of the move i was relatively engaged, even with the two dimensional characters. there were scenes of violence but nothing too extreme. Then came the second half. The second half of the movie is so ridiculous that i was laughing out loud for most of it. there was a very puppet looking jaguar going straight for the face of one of the baddies running after the fleeing hero (after the hero had been outrunning it with an arrow wound that would have killed most people for a distance of at least a football field). there was a snake that went for the neck of someone near it, as opposed to his hand which was much closer. and during that human sacrifice scene there was an eclipse that took place in about one minute. strangely enough that didn't bother me nearly as much as the full moon that night, the orbits simply don't work that way. Also, rain does not fall nearly as fast in reality as it does in this movie. when our hero finally gets to his lovely wife it begins to rain, and the very large whole she is in begins to fill up, at an apparent rate of 6-12 inches per minute. giving birth in the water also seemed somewhat, and by that i mean totally, unnecessary. The cinematography of this movie is also nothing special. It's show the same way every other movie is shot with no amazing shots to distinguish anything. The movie has more bad things working for it than anything else. During the poorly choreographed fight sequences the camera is very shaky and never focuses in on what is happening. No doubt trying to capture the chaos that is going on, but it does a better job of being confusing and sickening than anything else. It is a trick that mediocre filmmakers use as opposed to choreographing real fight sequences. The movie title is even very misleading. there is no real apocalypse in the movie. the closest you get in the Spanish coming ashore at the very END of the movie for less than a minute. There is one good thing to be said for this movie however, the acting of Jaguar Paw is very well done. he is very believable in his plight to get back to his wife and child. he isn't giving a whole lot of dialog which leave most of his acting with his face and body, which as a result has him looking on in disbelief in most scenes, but he is believable none-the-less. The move had potential to show the culture of ancient people from a lost culture, but chose instead to go the route of needless violence and apparent lost facts. In short i think that the greatness of Mel Gibson (Braveheart) is lost to his days of, well, this. the best comparison i can make for this movie is I believe it is to his career what Battlefield Earth was to John Travolta's.

That does not change the fact that this movie was poorly shot, directed, and written. those are my two cents, now let the hate-mail roll(Note: if you feel the need to tell me ""I'm full of it."" please state EXACTLY why you think that, and i will state why i think you are wrong if i think that, you could present very good evidence. you're entitled to you opinion as much as i am)",Apocalypto
915,jcnyc87,Great Movie!,10,15 December 2006,"I read everyone's comments and thoughts and I clearly see there's two sides to the story. Some say it puts down the Mayas by making them seem like blood thirsty savages and others agree that indeed they were savages and that's exactly what Mel Gibson tryed to portrayed.Well folks you have to keep an open mind with everything in life you just can't agree with everything you hear or know about as the truth. All civilizations had some kind of gruesome custom and ways of living,it's just the way they survived. Some say Mel Gibson is intentionally trying to make the indigenous people seem bad but I don't think that is true. That's the way the Mayans lived their lives and it was normal for them because unlike now that we know the answers to much of the things around us from space to atoms they didn't, so some things were based on beliefs and myths not facts and that's what shaped their way of living and made them sacrifice men to the Gods, of course now we see it as unhumane.Even though they did human sacrifice in gruesome ways Mel still captures the intelligence and the caring nature of these people.Bottom line is Mel Gibson delivered a great movie with an outstanding storyline. I'm Mexican-American and I did not get offended as some of you did, there is no reason to. Although it is annoying when some ignorant people belief some Hispanics are still this way. That is nonsense, we are in a different time now and life is not as hard as it used to be. Plus I loved the fact that Mel Gibson made this movie to show some of the Mayan history which is not really represented in much of America unless you read books and watch documentaries. It's great to see something else something very foreign and unique rather than the same old boring stuff. It's a must watch and a great movie it's defetinely worth every penny. GO WATCH IT NOW!!!!",Apocalypto

But even the initial hunt that set up their sense of community was written like a bad Fox sitcom merely ported to another space and time. Comic book villains and comic book revenge factors, too. I expected a little more.Maybe the violence really did serve a purpose. It may be the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. There may have been some heart to the movie, but no brains were evident (with the obvious exception of the on screen kind). Where have all the intelligent scripts gone?Tell me one thing, Mel - how can you have a total solar eclipse and a full moon all in the same day?

The whole storyline is a young hunter named Jaguar Paw who's village has been ravaged and it's citizens sold into slavery and sacrificed to the gods. Jaguar Paw narrowly escapes death several times (often in the most improbable ways, save his attacker struck by lightning). The costumes and acting were amazing, there was A LOT of gore, but I think it was all worth it. Definitely not for the faint hearted, but I went and saw it anyway (with a gut that can't watch Grey's Anatomy). This was definitely one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. Mel Gibson deserves some kudos for this new film.",Apocalypto
918,rjfolk-1,Good film for goofs category,7,17 December 2006,"There were just to many inconsistencies in this movie. Gibson didn't do enough research on some simple things.The Mayans were precocious astrological mathematicians. They would not have be so mystified by the solar eclipse. And having thousands of natives looking up at the sun during the eclipse would have turned them into a race of blind men/persons. Furthermore, a nearly-full moon is shown the first night after the solar eclipse. This is impossible as solar eclipses only occur during a new moon, and a full moon would be 14 days away.The slaves were taken through a fast-moving river that was about five feet deep. They walked through it like it was still water. At this depth, the fast moving water would exert tons of force. No one could walk through such a deep and fast-moving river.",Apocalypto

The story showed how determined and powerful love can be for our families. I can understand the drive to save his family, I would move heaven and earth to save mine. It was hard for me to watch the children, I could not wait to go home and hold my own. I was given a glimpse into my children's and my own mortality. How we are all just a step or a situation away from death everyday. How where and when we are born defines our existence. It was very graphic, but that was the way it was. In some places in the world that is still a way of life. People are slaughtered, raped, starving, diseased. Children die or are killed every day. We need to appreciate our lives and how lucky we are to have what we have. Mel Gibson and his team did a wonderful job! I am looking forward to the next epic film from his direction.",Apocalypto

I was pleased by the strong scenes that Mel integrates pushing the viewers to the limits.

922,jaitorrez,A thrilling dramedy and Mel's finest work to date!,10,17 December 2006,"I have to concur with the first critique, it definitely is Gibson's masterpiece. Mel can sure direct, this movie is a thrilling dramedy! You get hooked within the first 5 minutes of the movie till the end, it has a lot of funny dialog that isn't expected and it also very accurate portrayal of culture and life in those times. The costumes, the very little that there is are very well done, from the piercings, to the tattoos, to the branding, to the armor, everything was paid attention to. This is not a movie it is an experience, well worth it, There is a lot of attention to detail in this movie and it pays off big time. Keep in mind this movie is in the Mayan dialect, which makes the movie even more believable and makes more of an impact. I believe there are only 2 actors in this movie and the rest are of some type of Indian decent which also adds a true element. This is not a chick flick but I took my girlfriend and she loved it, I have to forewarn you it is very violent and disturbing but it's appropriate to keep the movie realistic and to upkeep the artistic integrity. This movie is not for children, there is a lot of nudity, after all this a culture with minimal clothing. The only thing I did not like about the movie was the cinematography, it was amateur at best, a lot of moving shots, and extreme close ups, in some parts of the movie I thought I was watching a student film, but that's only in some shots. As for the CGI effects in the movie, they were great, you can tell Mel emptied his pocket on this one, everything look so real! Shell out your 10 bucks for this one it's likely going to win best picture at the Academy Awards!",Apocalypto

The realism and visualization of horrific acts of torture, sacrifice, and violence was incredible. Yeah, yeah, everyone criticizes about inaccuracy of the setting of the film, but I was thoroughly entertained and excited, and I want to see the film again. I thought the film was a visionary masterpiece with its own uncultivated veracity. The director (Mel) is a very imaginative and effective filmmaker. He defiantly has a knack for creating incredible, heart-pounding experiences. Apocalypto is the best film I've seen all year!",Apocalypto
924,GuitarGirl14580,"Looking for something different, found something depressing.",5,4 January 2007,"I was eager to see this movie because so many comments called it ""totally different"". I wish someone would have outed it as a ""hack 'em & stack 'em""..that would have taken it right out of the running for me. I avoid that genre at all cost. I have enough negativity in my life, I go to movies to escape that.I tell people that it isn't the violence that bothers me in movies, but in this case, I have to say it was RIDICULOUS. Perhaps some other reviewers go to many movies and have become jaded to violence on this level. I, however, have not. If there was more of the heroes getting over on their tormentors, perhaps that would have made the really, horrible gruesome violence tolerable. But to me, the movie had a good first 5 minutes, and then it was just sadness, murder, violence, crunch, smash, ick-ness. I wanted to walk out, but I'd insisted on seeing it, so I was trapped, not to put too fine a point on it.Other than hating the movie, it was well-done. Somebody needs to smack Mel upside his head though. What was he thinking? Unless you're completely jaded to human murder, mayhem and torment, stay away.",Apocalypto
925,xxxmalcontentxxx,Historically Inaccurate,5,20 December 2006,"This movie was very well made, as I thought it would be, coming from the man who directed Braveheart and the Passion.The story is simple, yet engaging. It briefly introduces the main characters at the beginning, a pack of village hunters, and depicts their idyllic lives in the jungle and their questionable sense of humor. Not before long, the tribe is besieged and their women raped by a brutal horde of warriors that seem to worship strength. While the weaker tribesmen are slain, the stronger ones that were able to resist the attack for a considerable time were spared and hauled off through the jungle. One of the tribesman, Jaguar Paw, managed to lower his family into a well unseen before he helped defend his village and eventually got captured. Throughout the movie, his only goal is to escape his captors and make it back to the well before it rains, and he must use all his hunting skills to survive. And that is basically what the film was about.It did, however, have nothing to do with the Mayan Civilization and its people, as everyone was misled into thinking by countless reviews. Archeologists and Anthologists alike agree that this film was a big mistake, because people will unfortunately think it is true. It is not true, and this is what convinced me to write this review. So, if you do not care about historical inaccuracies in a movie that is based about an ancient people, and only care if it was a well made film, as I have already stated it was, then I beg you to discontinue reading. I will point out all the 'liberties' the director, or screen writer took (I don't care whose fault it was, and never checked) to people who are seriously interested in one of the most advanced ancient civilizations in all the Americas.I have been obsessed with the Mayans ever since I visited Chichen Itza pyramids and ruins, and every year I look into the subject to see if anything new has been discovered. And as much as I would like to detail their entire history and all their achievements, I promise to restrain myself.The first discrepancy I noticed while watching the movie was how the sacrifices were handled. When Jaguar Paw saw the murals on the walls of blue figures being led to their deaths, I remained open minded and thought perhaps I missed that in all my readings of the Mayans, but what I knew for sure is that the sacrificial participants were not randomly rounded up in villages on the outskirts of civilization and later forced to their deaths. Sacrificial Participants were Kings and noblemen who volunteered death. Many of their blood, such as brothers or sisters would follow so they could be with them in the underworld. This was such a high honor, that common folk would arrange their burials to lay beneath their Kings. I would later learn that no such mural of blue painted figures exist, and that was pure fantasy.The second was how the Mayans reacted to an ellipse, as if it came unexpectedly, as a sign. This is absurd. The Mayans, like the Egyptians, were masters of astronomy and created a calendar more accurate then our present day Gregorian Calender. I encourage people who don't believe me to look it up. Not only would they know what an eclipse was, they would know when one would come before it came. These people tracked the motions of the stars, the planets, especially the planet Venus, and somehow described the position of the Milky Way in their writings before the invention of a telescope.In all the archaeological digs, no evidence of mass graves have been unearthed, such as the one Janguar Paw stumbles into after running through the corn field. This is another fantasy of the director, or screen writer, or whatever. I did not pay much attention to the credits.This fourth mistake in the movie I do not credit myself for, because I learned of it later after reading about the film. It has to do with the murals depicted on the walls during various parts of the movie. None of them correspond with the time period specified in the movie.And there are more, but that should be enough to show just how misleading this film is. Had I have not known anything about the Mayans, then surely I would have loved this film in my complete ignorance of the facts. Having known these details, however, keeps me from taking this movie seriously. I do not consider myself unfortunate, for the facts and true story of the Mayans is much more engaging, and is still unfolding.Hopefully, people will be encouraged to seek the truth, and not buy a lie, which is exactly what you do when you pay to watch this movie, and hope people will not just dismiss me as a Mel Gibson hater, who I rather admire, having defied Hollywood and making a profit with his own artistic endeavors. Do I think he is a drunken bigot? Well, apparently he is. Dose he masturbate to the Daniel Pearl Decapitation video? I wouldn't put it pass him. Do I care? I certainly do not, and laugh at those who would care and would take offense to the opinions or world views of some entertainer.",Apocalypto

He aims to please for those that want to hear his message and I was extremely impressed and pleased. First, this movie is very original and very bloody. For those of you who said that this movie was too gruesome, well, what do you expect. That is how the Mayan's lived. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is obviously not scared of a little blood and violence. The only part of the movie that I did not care for and I thought should have been left out was when Jaguar Paw's wife ended up having the baby in the cave.

It could be because I don't like battle based movies and expected something supernatural or ""apocalyptic"" happening, literally. Next thing I didn't stand was that the plot is slowed down and the movie could be completed in one hour and half, for example. Apocalypto would be interesting to people who like ancient history, (it provides Mel Gibson's point of view) although we still don't know what really happened to the Aztec and Mayan tribes those times.

929,thetower,A culture difference mended!,8,22 December 2006,"Going into this movie, I have to admit I had my trepidations. I often enjoy foreign films, but this was an American film all subtitled. Also with the recent exploits of Gibson, and the question of too much violence in this movie. I had my doubts if it would live up to its expectations. After the first thirty minutes or so my worries were gone. From the first frame this movie puts you into the time and place, and the immersion is remarkable. You actually feel as if you've lived the life portrayed on the screen before. The violence (while heavy at times) is actually done in a way that dosen't seem brutal or over the top. It just seems realistic for that time period and situation. The actors (while one of the complaints was no big names) did a remarkable job. And this is quite possibly the first film I've ever seen, that I can say if it had marquee names, it might have actually taken away from the realness of it all. The ending I thought was a little ""Hollywood"" but still held together nicely, and you sensed a change for ""their"" world was inevitable. Over all I was very happy with my movie going experience and wouldn't hesitate seeing it on the big screen again. Even though the run time is a little long, it gets right to the point and keeps you enraptured for the most part of the 2hr. 30min. run time.

931,justsomuch-1,Realistic,8,23 December 2006,I thought this movie was very realistic. Cultures have their own life. You could tell that there was a familial closeness in the ones represented. Their spiritual beliefs were different. Some felt they needed to appease their gods by sacrifices and others felt they developed good virtues by digesting organs of animals or humans.I thought it was interesting when the day became dark because of the eclipse and the people thought it was a sign of the gods approval of their sacrifices. The high priest knew different --you could tell in his facial expression--he just wanted to control the people so he used the circumstances to his own advantage. Isn't this like a lot of the so-called leaders of religions today? Man made rules and control!In my thinking anyone who went to see this movie knew the theme of it before viewing it -----so if you don't like this sort of graphic nature -- why pay to see it? Mel Gibson is known for the graphic nature of his movies and the R rating would give a hint of the movie's content.

932,ashley40-1,Fantastic! Apocalypto 'the Movie' in accordance with what was going on in Mexico in 1518.,9,24 December 2006,"The movie was well filmed, on a great location, with fantastic backdrops, and is Mel Gibson accurate on all accounts? No, but directors and cinematographers must make changes and put in their montages what they see as a visual story.A small tribe being abducted to be sacrificed did indeed happen in the time of the film 1517 & 1518 the Post Classical Maya period. Even though it was the Aztecs who were the strongest in the time portrayed by the film, ""they 'the Mayas' were close allies of the Aztecs, they shared ideas and religion; and there were trade routes throughout Mesoamerica.' (Adams,1998)Were there all kinds of sacrifices going on? Yes, the Mesoamericans were going through all kinds of bad prophecies, such as the hundred year drought and there had been very little rain for the crops. People were starving, the moon ate the sun, and wild animals were attacking the villagers more and more. Since the Europeans had already landed in the Antilles and had already ventured into the Yucatan coast; there was an epidemic of measles and chicken pox that were heavily affecting the American Indigenous, who had no resistance for such diseases (the little girl in the movie). These were all signs that the gods were displeased.For the Aztecs, Mayas and Incas blood was life. It was the flow of life, the liquid that provided life for them, and for the gods as well; and if the gods did not get enough blood the gods were unhappy. So the Aztecs and Mayas were sacrificing at an alarming rate trying to please the gods. This was unfortunate for the villages and tribes in and around the Aztec and Mayan major cities. Since the sacrifices had depleted the population in the larger cities (they could only sacrifice so many of their city people without creating chaos within the city) and most of the citizens and families had already donated a child or an adult male or female to the gods. Worriers were ordered to go outside the larger cities and abduct by force several individuals (young, old, women, and children) from the surrounding villages and tribes. The Spaniards were very much astonished when they witnessed their first human sacrifice, talk about cultural clash.Most of the surrounding villagers did not want to partake in the sacrifices and several of the small villages had already donated a number of their kinfolks to the city leaders for sacrifices. Hence the bloody mess at the temples throughout Mexico in those times was horrendous, ""approximately 40,000 individuals had been sacrificed in one year in Teotihuacan alone"" (Adams, 1998). Imagine about 100 sacrifices per day.This is why Cortés had no problem recruiting 50,000 to 100,000 Indigenous fighters to help his 400 Spaniard eventually defeat the Aztecs.The thrill of seeing a young father and proud tribesmen going to save his wife and children is what movies are made of. The setting in the jungle, the animals, the danger, the trill of victory are all in this film, and even better because of the Mayan background.See it, let the true or untrue facts rest (were the Mayans savages or not?), and the movie is no more gory or graphic than the video games our children here in the USA play.",Apocalypto

Also I can not understand in what way the rain has reduced its strength and actually for the time Jaguar Paw has made some rounds round its farmer village and killed his main enemy the rain has not so strong already and Jaguar's paw wife and his two kids stayed over the water.Also another interesting question was for baby birth.As we know baby takes its first breath only after the connection to his mather ( I don't know the exact name of this medicine termin in English) is already cut?

Unlike Gibson film, ""The Passion of the Christ"", I thought this violence was appropriate for the times and the people. In ""The Passion of the Christ"", the flogging of Christ by the Romans was far too overdone. No one, not even Jesus, could have survived that amount of punishment, then to walk the stations of the cross. Just way too much! However, in ""Apocolyto"" the violence added to the believability of the story; although it did seem a little too ""superhuman"" for the main character to go running so hard and so fast through the jungle after being wounded twice.Moreover, there is no question that Rudy Youngblood deserves an Oscar for his performance. Outstanding!!! I was rooting for him the whole way. Virile, strong, compassionate and determined! He was great! I will definitely go to see his next movie. I can't wait.

Canada trained children in Schools a world-view that depicted Indigenous Peoples as 'savages, subhuman, prehistoric and uneducated'. Social Studies really Racist Studies text books taught children Racist Ideologies backed by Racist Scientific Genetic Theory as justification of the assumption and imposition of European supremacy and the justification of the genocide and extermination of Indigenous Peoples of America's. Racist Assumptions of European 'supremacy' and Indigenous 'savagery' seen as 'normal' are systemic, institutional, historic in Canada. And it might appear less than hopeful when one can not stop the teaching of racist ideologies and attitudes of exclusion and extermination of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. Indigenous Women have the highest murder rate in Canada. While Indigenous Peoples have the highest birth rate, their death rate is higher than the birth rate. Until recently in Canada, Indigenous children were removed from their homes, families, cultures, communities to have their languages beaten out of them, used as slaves, raped, murdered, suicide for generations.Cher",Apocalypto
940,misulehri,Apocalypto is a disgusting movie,1,29 December 2006,"I was a fan of Mel Gibson, but after seeing his latest movie 'Apocalypto' i changed my opinion of him as a talented director, though he was, and is a very talented actor. I saw the movie with my 26 years son.The revolting scene of men cutting the hunted animal, and making one man to eat the animal's balls, made my son to go to washroom to vomit. The graphic torture scenes and human sacrifice were equally disgusting. the later half of somewhat interesting part of movie's idea has been taken from the wonderful 1965 movie 'The Naked Prey'.In my opinion 'Braveheart' was Mel Gibson's best movie.And 'Passion of Christ', though contained lengthy scene of Christ being tortured, was successful as it faithfully depicted the last hours of Christ. As Mark Twain has written in his assay 'That Damned Human Race', humans had conquered, tortured and killed the weaker ones on one pretext or another, religion being one, and this human nature is still manifesting itself in different parts of the world like massacres in Bosonia and Rowanda during 1990's.This damned human nature was not unique to American Indians to justify their massacres and enslavement at the hands of Spanish conquerors, as Mel Gibson has apparently given the message in the movie. The natives at least spared the children, whereas Spainiards killed them too, after mercifully baptizing them. Mel Gibson, after success of 'Passion' movie has made torture his selling point, and his next movie is likely to surpass in graphic depiction of disgusting and revolting torture scenes.",Apocalypto
941,MovieLover211,Fantastically Realistic,9,28 December 2006,"For those of you who rate this movie as highly violent,then you slept through the unit on Latin America you were taught in junior high/middle school. Any current teacher of Mexico/Central America can tell you that if Gibson had portrayed the city life and the sacrificial scene as any less realistic,then he would have been missing true details. This is how it was, and kudos to Gibson for adding the other hints to what may have actually happened to the Mayans; starvation, civil wars, disease. The only drawback I have to the history was having the Europeans show up at the end. Too many people will confuse the Mayans with the Aztecs and will see those arriving people as true conquerors, which the Mayans did not have. All in all, a great movie for those of us who have taught it, and have finally been able to watch it unfold before our eyes.",Apocalypto
942,aggie504,Memorable,10,31 December 2006,"I have to say that Apocalypto is one of the best movies i've ever seen. Highly action packed with a great storyline. The characters are so real and you can't help but care what'll happen to 'em. Unlike some films where you don't really bother whether the characters die or not. At first, it was a bit funny seeing butt naked guys wearing loin cloths but somehow, after about 15 minutes, i got used to it. This is one of Mel's finest movies, maybe even more brilliant than Braveheart. Jaguar Paw, who is the main character, seems to have a permanent look of disbelief on his face. Rudy Youngblood, who plays Jaguar Paw, was quite excellent. It's such a unique film. It's one of the few times i've been entranced by a film. I definitely have to get it on DVD.",Apocalypto
943,urbauerk,Excellent!,10,30 December 2006,"I saw it a few days ago with my mom. We both loved it.It was Excellent! Very well done. Mel Gibson is brilliant! It was riveting and you were on the edge of your seat the whole time! I normally like love stories or ""feel good"" movies, not necessarily thrillers- I would not call this a thriller per se, but it kept us on the edge of our seats the whole time, and the ending is a feel good one. I believe Mel Gibson is one of the best directors in Hollywood today. The writing, acting and directing was excellent.I highly recommend it- it will not disappoint you.A must see!",Apocalypto
944,bluehiway04,horrible,1,30 December 2006,"I was absolutely horrified by what I saw in Apocolypto. As someone with roots in Southern Mexico, I have always been fascinated by the Mayan culture and was excited when I heard that Mel Gibson was making a film about their demise. When I saw the movie over the holiday weekend, nothing offended me more than what I watched in the two hours of relentless blood-lust. Not at any time did Mr. Gibson touch on the fact that the Maya were an advanced culture delving deeply into Science, Math and Astronomy. They were mathematical geniuses with the most highly developed and accurate calendar the world has ever seen. They were farmers deeply in touch with the land. They were craftsmen and traders. He never touched on the ball court, which was central to the Mayan culture and religion. No one disputes the sacrificed and the hearts being extracted but the sacrificed were honored and respected and were not decapitated and kicked from the temples and heaped in reeking piles of rotting flesh. Nothing has ever offended me more than this film and I will never give any money towards anything that Mel Gibson or ICON films has touched.",Apocalypto
945,Katcanuck,Gratuitous violence,1,30 December 2006,"I could not sit through this entire movie - I walked out half way through it - largely because of the violence but I also felt that it really is so unfair to the Mayan civilization. I don't think there was one form of cruelty to man, or one form of torture that good old' Mel did not dream up in this movie, and that was only in the half that I watched! I think this movie depicts Mel's state of mind more than it does the Mayan civilization. I find very little difference between this movie and his other ""historical"" pictures. The story really follows the typical adventure model - we meet the hero - we are given reasons to identify and grow to care about the hero -then the hero goes through a series of trials and tribulations... (don't want to spoil the ending for those with the stomach to sit through the whole sad thing, as did my husband who watched till the bitter end and related the broad sequence of events) So what's different about Mel's movie? Yes, there are a few gimicks that give the movie more interest and appeal, such as the setting, the cinematography, the use of the Mayan language, etc. - but I really felt that these were mere excuses to showcase one torture method after another. I've never seen a more violent, a more unnecessarily violent movie. If Mel was really interested in giving the audience an account of historical events he should have shown a more even-handed depiction of Mayan civilization - stopped to acknowledge some of their accomplishments. I was truly offended by this excuse for a horror picture.",Apocalypto
946,stable-1,one of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,31 December 2006,"This movie was fairly interesting at the beginning, but quickly degenerated into a stream of senseless cruelty and violence that could only appeal to SM addicts. I'm 60 years old, have only walked out on 2 movies in my life, and this was one of them. Boring movies are bad enough, but ones like this, which I found both boring and evocative of a profound disgust for my fellow human beings (especially Mel Gibson) I find intolerable. It is downright scary to me that people with supposedly civilized tastes (e.g. professional critics) could admire anything so blatantly and crudely sensationalistic and trite to the point of being juvenile in the construction of its story. I walked out halfway through the film, but my daughter watched the whole thing, and verified my prediction of the ending. As art, this thing ranks with The Jerry Springer Show.",Apocalypto
947,btompson-1,What happens next.,8,31 December 2006,"If, as you watch any movie, you find yourself drawn into the script and the plot,then the director has done his job. That is, to make the storyline so interesting that the viewer is totally engulfed throughout and at the end wants the story to continue. Mr.Gibson, in my opinion has accomplished just that with this movie. Although the faint of heart would not agree. Apocalypto left me desiring to know what happens in the future for a young family searching for ""New Beginnings.Do they regroup with the orphans? Start a new village? Ever contact the Spanish? Perhaps rescue some of the villagers from their torment, Who knows? It does not matter, as long as it leaves one with that sort of wanting the whole plot works and that is what counts.",Apocalypto
948,ruhel,Best Mel film yet!,9,31 December 2006,"This is another awesome movie by Mel. I enjoyed the previous efforts by him, Passion of the Christ and Braveheart especially, and was hoping this would match those films. In fact, I think this is his best film to date! In my opinion, this film gives a great insight into the Mayan civilisation. They were not all savages which the invading Europeans had to domesticate!The village life and harmony was a joy to behold. The emphasis the Mayans put on family life was lovely to see. The son following the father with respect, truly a dying vocation these days. The excitement in the film is nonstop and builds up beautifully as the film goes on. I was on the edge of my seat, willing Jaguar Paw back to his village in time to save his family. I also think shooting in the native language, once again pays full dividends. All in all, please watch this film as an adventure movie firstly and a film by Mel Gibson only at the end. I am sure you will not leave disappointed.",Apocalypto
949,dated25,Great Film,10,31 December 2006,"Although there were a few inaccuracies in the costuming, the phases of the moon (full moon following a total eclipse is impossible) and the degree of civilization still existing in the Yucatan at the time that the Conquistadors arrived in the early 16th century, the drama, recreation of the cultural context, and the message this story tells us about our own lives, our own inner demons, and our own transgressions against humanity that this film delivers will be difficult to surpass. As a student of pre-Columbian history, I found the acting, the role casting, and the physical settings to be astonishingly accurate. If Mel Gibson had a secret time machine in which to go back to view the actual reality at the time of his drama I doubt he could have done a better job.",Apocalypto
950,jfeltman-1,cheap excuse for gratuitous violence,2,1 January 2007,"Mel obviously spent no time researching his topic, understanding human nature, or worrying about how his cheap treatment of the Mayan culture would impact the descendants of that culture. While I have no problem with some artistic license, this movie is the functional equivalent of a movie that depicts the Navajo tribe as a bloodthirsty bunch of savages who raped, plundered and slaughtered their own people. Historically, the idea that some of the incidents depicted happened at the same chronological period is damn near criminal. All in all, the movie is a waste of time. The only thing saving it from being a ""1"" is that it is contains some pretty scenery and the actors appear to be working very hard. Save your time and money..go see something else or at least do not believe Mel's idea of what the Mayan culture was like.",Apocalypto
951,wiredmax2003,Don't miss out on the most heart-pounding and beautifully filmed picture of the year.,10,5 January 2007,"Granted, many people are upset with Gibson right now, but if you don't see this movie, you're missing out on the most heart-pounding and beautifully filmed picture of the year. Along with the movie's core message of how a civilization falls, the action scenes are incredible, and the cinematography is so hypnotizing it makes every scene exciting.I love a movie that's not just a job to its makers, but a passion. And you can see the passion that was put into this film, between Gibson's direction and Youngblood's dynamic performance. I also enjoyed this film because it's a different kind, you don't see too many movies like this in theaters. This is a very graphic film, however, and I wouldn't recommend letting you kids see it. Kudos to Gibson for this one. A+",Apocalypto

Movie is really brutal, but it is part of realism, and that part i really liked too... Thats the reason i justify many gory scenes... Thumbs up for Mell, he was really brave to make movie like this... I mean, something like Maya's history, with their language (which approved great), at first may not be interesting... But look now how much money movie gain... Gibson as great director really succeeded in my eyes...In short: if you are little bit interested in history of Maya's, their way of life, great adventure, and really thrilling movie with great scenes, see this! Highly recommended...",Apocalypto

954,thejackalopesvoice,Beautiful despite political inconsistency.,9,6 January 2007,"The film is exquisite in form and the characters of the tribe are developed in a way that makes them immediately understandable and relatable, even with sub-captions. Gibson once again proves he is a master film maker. The action never stops once the characters are introduced in full form. Gibson reveals to us another story of human savagery when one people group looks upon another as less than human. And savage they are.The peculiar political mind of Gibson confounds me though. The speech made by the head priest was obviously pointed at President Bush, a point Mr. Gibson made clear in interviews when he was filming and upon release of the movie. It is confusing because just as the Maya were capable of engineering feats to solve their problem of famine though irrigation via aqueducts (like the Romans), the leaders of Islamic terror groups such as Hamas and Al-Qaeda also choose for themselves and their people to live in troglodyte fashion while they too pass up cultural advancement in their zeal to sacrifice innocents in appeasement of their god.The parallel is mindbogglingly clear, but Gibson persists in his view that the priest represents President Bush sacrificing our troops, which for me made the film's head priest's soliloquy mind-numbingly stupid and therefore overly long.Regardless of the political inconsistency, a point I would liken to the usual Hollywood fare of rewriting history to suit their screwy political vagaries, the film as a whole is a notable divergence from the usual assumed Hollywood blockbuster.",Apocalypto
955,sinhue-2,Great Movie,10,6 January 2007,"I really liked this movie from beginning to end. I love the way they threw in the comedy bit at the beginning. I like the way the created and built the characters personalities. The plot was intense and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen b/c I thought I would miss something. I love the triumph of the character over evil as Mel Gibson's movies tend to do. I like that this character lived at the end which is different from his previous (Braveheart, Passion) All and all this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of any age, even kids. I don't think it had as much ""gore"" and blood as it was hyped up to have, but there were a couple of gruesome scenes, which were just enough off camera to keep the focus on the situation vs. on the malice.",Apocalypto
956,alexa_alma,"Apocalypto, why??????",3,6 January 2007,"I just came back from the theater and i am disappointed. The movie is pointless. There is no real subject and the characters lack substance. I love the footage and the scenes, actually everything about the image, but there is an obvious problem concerning the script, or maybe the director. I have nothing against Mel Gibson but i am just wondering why all that brutality in his movies. I mean Tarantino is quite brutal but Quentin's brutality is an art that obviously Gibson will never share. I know that people will fill the theaters to see this movie and this is due to the huge promotion it has. the thing that gets to me is that happy ending Apocalypto has, typically American.",Apocalypto

Mel Gibson has done it very close to the historical facts. Very good decision not to use famous actors. Although not experienced-very good acting on behalf of all the the actors involved. Impressed by the language used too. It is shot with the usual for Mel Gibson's movies perfection. It contains everything-action, humour, sadness, very moving movie about the strength of love and the importnace to overcome your own fear, for the unsuspected strength of human will.Highly recommended to everybody, especially to people interested in Mayan history and culture.Lovely!",Apocalypto
958,rmazatanp,"Ignorance, clichés, prejudices and too much blood in the wrong places",2,9 January 2007,"There must be something wrong in reducing a whole, complex civilization to the director's own delirium of bloodshed. Is Mel Gibson a master of hyperrealism or just a man obsessed with violence? The fact that he is only accurate regarding violence suggests that the latter is more likely. Moreover, his inclination to show acts of violence and blood baths as-they-are-in-reality, because he thinks it makes him a very serious artist or because he doesn't want to be patronising with his viewers or for whatever reason, contrasts with the constant Hollywood clichés, resulting in a really annoying cinematic experience. In this sense for instance-, he thinks it is of the utmost importance for the story to show how the human flesh stretches when a jaguar is devouring a man's face; but the fact that a man (a different one, of course) badly wounded by an arrow- can run at his maximum speed for miles and miles in the forest of Yucatán (not actually filmed in Yucatán, by the way), well that's just a literary license for him. Mel Gibson cannot even distinguish between the Aztecs and the Mayans. It was the Aztecs who thought they were at the dusk of their power when the Spanish arrived, the Mayan empire goes several centuries back. But let's not even follow that path, more appropriate for an academic forum .What it utterly wrong about this film remains in the narrative level. Some Gallipoli in the beginning to show how cheerful and happy were these people before the cruel invasion. Then some Mad Max in the city to show how depraved and decadent were the baddies (the 'pure, absolute baddies' Hollywood loves so much). Then it becomes a pastiche of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Running Man and Van Damme in Hard Targe two deplorable films as well-, and others less famous films with exactly the same plot. It is a story that can be set in a rather ridiculous futuristic context, in contemporary New Orleans (or before Katrina, at least), and basically in any other setting. So: Why would Mel Gibson embark in a super production working with a virtually unknown cast, wholly spoken in presumably- Mayan, and in such a complex cultural and historical context, to tell a petty story that has already been told several times, even using the same narrative tools. I can think of a couple of answers: He knows well the darkest sides of the market and is cynical enough to exploit it (someone has even proposed this for third Oscar, how dark is that!); or he is too naïve to know that he knows or understands nothing of Meso American cultures; or perhaps simply his ambition is far greater than his brains. Whatever the reason, he has made a shameful film.",Apocalypto
959,vipgirl-1,explanation,10,9 January 2007,"I enjoyed the film very much and while watching it didn't even once thought about something else. My popcorns were left intacted. During the film, I didn't get a 'point' which of the tribes, the one that was attacked or the other one who attacked, were the Mayans. Then I found an info on net that Mayan civilization consisted of several tribes. This would mean that the both tribes were Mayans, and presents them as a cruel and brutal civilization in spite their cities, knowledge of astronomy etc. I would like to know if someone else has a same opinion about both tribes being Mayans an also, to emphasize that maybe the introduction at the beginning of the film would be of great help to understand a 'Mayan story'.",Apocalypto

I can not wait to see what he has got in the store next, come on Mel before you get into another (a real) alcohol-trouble give us another one. Yes it is very well made, but when it comes to substance it is nothing other than a Mel Gibson attack on (ancient)American civilizations, his second after his attack on people before Jesus.

Its a part of history no one has touched and to make such a good film out of a fairly vague topic in a sense is real impressive. Gory it is, however Gibson pulls it off as he has made such an exciting fast pace film. It is definitely worth watching and there is know chance you will be disappointed. Like Gibson did with braveheart, a time in history chartered but not widely known he brought it to the big screen with great effects, storyline and manages to create an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are very familiar with the topic. The use of unknown actors also contributes to the quality of this film, showing that millions on big names do not mean much when you have a great story to tell. Truly an epic movie an a good bet for an Oscar.",Apocalypto
962,oceangray-1,So well done I thought it was a documentary,10,12 January 2007,"This film is a real visual treat. Yet again another Gibson film destined to become a classic, just like Braveheart. I saw this film in a private screening the other day and was mesmerized from the opening scene, the film builds on the characters nicely making you feel for there plight. It will no doubt win dozens of awards for cinematography; you feel this film at times appears more of a David Attenbourer documentary regarding some lost tribe out in the Andies, than a film containing actors.I would say it may not be suitable for young children as some scenes are quite graphic. Yet for the more mature person this is by no means a blood fest film with no plot.So to finish, I highly recommend this film. A shame it came out in 07, had it been released in 06 it would without doubt be the best film of 06, the fact that 07 has just begun means a contender could come along ( although I doubt this very much ).Watch this film and be amazed.Come on Mel, you got to do a sequel (the possibilities are endless)",Apocalypto

Don't listen to the moaning that it doesn't portray the fall of the Mayan Empire, it's not supposed to, it just tells a story, it does not set out to be a history of the arrival of European's in the Mayan area. Horrific as it may be, its a love story at the end of the day along with a lot of action. Great acting throughout, particularly the lead characters and although the violence is horrific at times it is necessary as it shows just how bad some things were for those people in historic times. All I can say is that you have to see this film. Do not be put off by the fact that it is subtitled, it adds to the film instead of detracting from it. Watch and enjoy !!! Gary",Apocalypto

Unlike Mel Gibson's previous film 'The Passion of the Christ' this was not simply a graphic portrayal of violence, and appears to have little political/religious meaning. It is simply a great action movie with an engaging and developed story following one main character and his fight to escape being sacrificed to the gods and return to his wife and child.This film really draws you in with its fast pace and realism. The story is very well balanced with a good mix of scene setting and action. The violence is very realistic, and it is refreshing to see an action film with no guns, or even metal weapons in it at all. It is quite graphic in parts but not unecessarilly so. Without a doubt the best film I've seen in a long time, well worth the admission.p.s. If you're worried about the subtitles, don't be.

Very refreshing to go to the cinema to see a blockbuster, and it not be a typical ""america saves the day"" job!Visually stunning, Flawless acting, equal measures of tension and relief made this one of the best films I've seen on the big screen for ages.Attention to detail seemed to prevail throughout, it seemed to me as if a lot of thorough research had been done to make a very authentic Aztec feel.Special effects and stunts were well done because the film didn't revolve around them, although there were some significant scenes that definitely involved both!The film had more of an impact as there were no known actors that could have taken it away because of their familiarity to the audience. This was probably the the main reason i enjoyed the film so much.The storyline was simple but well thought out to keep the audience focused from beginning to end, with no unnecessary fill in scenes. To me the film had a very ""Gladiator"" feel and to have achieved this with relatively unknown actors, about a race of people which little is known is a great feat in itself.Look forward to seeing Mel Gibsons next movie.",Apocalypto

970,pascal420,Maya's Apocalypto,9,30 April 2007,"Great movie, full of realism. We now know Mel Gibson's preferences for religious sacrifices slaughter and bloodshed. However, Apocalypto is definitively less crude and violent as compared to The Passion of Christ. We are immediately caught by Jaguar's Paw's determination to succeed, I really liked the way Mel Gibson makes the suspense last... We really want to know how Jaguar's Paw is going to get out of trouble.The movie takes place just before the end of the Maya civilization, one of the world's first civilizations. A group of Mayan tribesman are hunting tapir(wild pig). Thanks to a primitive mechanic trap(a sort of gate full of spikes which slams the pig as it walks on the trigger) a big tapir was caught by the tribesmen trap(the scene is greatly made, full of action and realism as the tapir gets pierced by the trap's spikes). A funny part follows where one of the tribesman gets the pig's testicles during the share. After the tapir hunt, Flint Sky and his son Jaguar's Paw and the other tribesman encounter the procession of traumatized refugees. The procession's leader explains that their lands have been ravaged and asks permission to pass through flint sky's forest. The refugees have to pay the tribute, they pay fish against tapir meat that flint sky's men were hunting. During the night, Jaguar's Paw dreams about the procession leader, holding his own living heart in his hand crying: flee! Waking from his nightmare, he sees his village invaded by strangers, burning the huts and taking all adults into captivity. The movie then shows the transfer of the slaves and the crudeness of the Mayans. Blinded by their religions, we might think that they were no better than the Spanish coloners. Jaguar's Paw has to fight for his live so as to save his pregnant wife and son. Will he succeed against the terrible Mayas who only thought of serving their gods?",Apocalypto

I would need a vote scale of 11 for giving a fair vote to this movie.I'm from Mexico so I'll try to add a very particular point of view, for a Mexican person to the movie, since I have read almost every comment here for the movie and (with all my respects) there are three points I'd like to mention.Please forgive my English mistakes.At first, even if it's not really important, the movie plays (probably) in 1519, since it was in this year when Hernan Cortes reaches Veracruz coast (afther other expeditions, this time 3 years before the Aztec Empire was conquered by his army). Movie ends showing this moment indeed (or it really looks like!), so the story takes place before that moment, when Aztecs lived Moctezuma's last years reign (I think Gigson tries to show him shortly during the human sacrifices scenes, like a man wearing a very elaborated clothes and a big quetzal plume, sit just behind the Sume Priest who performed the sacrifices in the sacred stone).Second, a lot of people giving their comments here believe is the MAYAN civilization that where warriors conquer, take prisoner and perform the sacrifices and that's not true, it's the Aztec civilization. In almost every mesoamerican culture splendor years, territorial extension (conquering), cultural level and social organization reached a very amazing point, and the constant military enterprises were the key for controlling (and exploit, of course) other culture towns. Aztecs were probably the most brilliant at this point, the roman empire in mesoamerica. They exploited commerce, agriculture, the had universities and used a lot of tech and industry advances, but savage and brutal activities was an always present characteristic with this people, too. People submission throughout the force was very common. Mayan civilization had a very similar moment, but not in 1519 (Mayan civilization had their best moment more than 100 years before, but they just suddenly disappeared). In that year, the last Mayan survivors lived probably dispersed in small towns in the Tropical Woods and Jungles in Mexico's southeast. Jaguar Paw and his village belong to this civilization.Third, in spite of these facts, I understand Mr. Mel Gibson was not interested in clearing facts because movie is not intended to be a History class, but it was a GREAT way for telling a story (filled out of mysticism and magic, of course) in a very unknown environment. This means, he just avoid the history facts in order to tell his argument. I really admire his determination for filming his movie in the Maya and Nahuatl languages, and for showing these cultures moment at natural, it's a honor for my country. All my respects and my admiration. The BEST movie I've seen in YEARS.Best regards",Apocalypto
973,thechrisduffy,this is a good movie which Mel has really thought about,8,16 January 2007,Mel Gibson's Apocalypto last 2 hours full of suspense all the way through with romance action and fight scenes it is one of Mel Gibson's better movies it has most things for most of the older family members it puts some of Mel's other movies to shame (brave heart) but also shows he's still ready to make good movies which are a thrill to watch Rudy Youngblood gives an good performance throughout other actors what have never really been heard of before star leading roles and make excellent debut performances which should be nominated for Oscars and this could be the start of a great series of movies by Mel. overall this is a great movie and worth going too see at the cinema and will have you hanging on the edge of your seat,Apocalypto
974,johndavies673,Superb cinema magic,9,18 January 2007,"Apocalypto is a superb piece of cinema magic. Expertly directed by the ever controversial Mel Gibson. Although widely criticised for its 'over the top' violence, the film has a compelling enough story to keep the viewer interested and hooked. Credit must go to relative newcomer and the lead character Rudy Youngblood, whose exceptional performance as the devastated Jaguar Paw really captures the audience. Although the film has many chronological errors, the story does enough to convince. The fact that the movie is subtitled isn't an issue at all. The powerful performances from the cast, particularly Youngblood, instantly make you forget. Will Be difficult to top this year.",Apocalypto
975,mattyboy81,"Good Story, but not real...",6,18 January 2007,"Mel Gibson creates a good film here, with one major problem: This movie is not about Mayan culture. Parts of the movie are very authentic, but it fails horribly in a very fundamental way. The clothes are authentic. A lot of the characters seem very authentic. As far as the non-aesthetic aspects, way off... I will not give away any of the movie, just be warned that if you have an interest in this culture, you will probably feel mocked when watching this film.If you were to put aside historical inaccuracy, then this film would be excellent. Unfortunately, with a title like Apocalypto this is a difficult task.",Apocalypto
976,jackal-71,In general this film is not about the culture of Mayans.,3,19 January 2007,"All this film was full of brutality. In first 30 min already I was about to go out from the cinema for the first time in my life but for some reason I didn't. I am a teenager and violence should not bother me but this time it did. All the time I was asking myself why Mel Gibson is picturing exactly those things which he did and so violently alhough he could get along witout them. I went to see this movie because I had heard that it is very good. Of course cinematography, direction and other things are good but I think that In general this film mostly is not about the culture of Mayans and conquistadors but most like it is just a cheap thriller.",Apocalypto
977,hairymclary,jungle balls,3,19 January 2007,"What do you get if you cross Mel Gibson's ego, the Big Book of Action Movies and a National Geographic? Answer: Apocalypto, and a waste of £5.50.I've got a feeling that this movie was the upshot of an ill-advised bet. Some fool said, ""Hey, Mel, I bet you can't make an action movie based on a Myan civilisation!"". Mel Gibson thought he could, but I agree with the other guy...Apocalypto does little that we haven't seen before. Yes, it's set in the jungle and is presented in Myan (with subtitles), but that does not excuse the alarmingly lazy approach to the script. It plays out like every other action movie ever released, complete with a big bad guy, sadistic henchman, wounded good guy, impossible odds, Mano a Mano finishing brawls, ironically painful deaths and a race to the finish.'Fair enough', you might think, 'let's sit back and enjoy the spectacle. It does have an 18 certificate, after all. Let the claret flow...' But it doesn't even manage that. The action is tame by today's standards; over-worked slow-mo and incomprehensible splashes of blood is about as good as you get. Not even the gore junkies come out smiling.So, trees, exotic critters, macho shouting, predictably over the top plot and lots of slow motion running. That's your lot. Oh, and a cringe-worthy, completely irrelevant, frankly stupid ending. I suggest you stay at home, watch Plannet Earth on the Discovery Channel, then put your old Die Hard tape on again. You'll have a much better time.",Apocalypto
978,ddaavviidd30,Absolutely appalling,1,19 January 2007,I went to see this film expecting something wonderful following all the amazing reviews such as the Daily Telegraph's etc. I actually was horrified and appalled at the total gratuitous violence in this film. There is NO story apart from a group of happy jungle inhabitants being removed by violence from their dwelling. The subtitles speak for themselves as they run out one third through and you're left watching a load of stupid men in home made thongs running around the jungle. The violent scenes are FAR too graphic and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would avoid this film at all costs. Shame on you Mr Gibsoncall yourself a Christian?,Apocalypto
979,zephyr7-1,It felt unfinished and had Hollywood formula,7,20 January 2007,"This is a three part movie, making it seem very Hollywood, but it's not in some ways - it didn't have the polish in the lighting and camera work. I actually found some of it feeling a bit amateurish, as if it was shot on video instead of film. Perhaps it was digital? The lighting was not quite right, and some camera angles were not really capturing the moment. The colour in the jungle went from vivid to quite flat in some places. The close ups and panning shots of the pursuit of the tapir felt like they were done in a specific order, as if Mel has said 'OK, I've got the legs running, now the head, now the torso, now the obligatory point of view of the animal...' It had Act 1) Establishing society and the village scene; Act 2) Removal from the safety and comfort of familiarity and introduction to the unknown; Act 3) Pursuit and triumph against adversity. The three act performance driven by the revenge and romance themes felt very formulaic, that felt just like Hollywood. That's not an original way to structure a movie.I like the use of traditional language and subtitles - we need more of this in film making. The message was a little confusing though, but that may simply be because we know so little about the Mayan culture. It didn't really delve into the technological knowledge and scientific abilities of the Mayans at all, I was a bit disappointed about that. It came across only as a movie about very primitive people, who were extremely superstitious and intent on destroying themselves. But I feel that's a very narrow view. The Spanish at the end seemed somewhat tacked on. I understood the historical significance of that, but it was a critical moment devoid of any threat or emotion. What happened to the two men on the beach? That part of the story should have been told and because of that I felt it was unfinished and lacking depth.I would have to say I enjoyed The Last of the Mohicans more - that's what it reminded me of, especially the father/son combination. Mohicans was a Hollywood film and didn't try to be anything other than that. Mel's not quite decided what he wanted to do in Apocalypto - art or Hollywood or mockumentary? I feel he missed a great opportunity to do so much more with a theme that hasn't really been explored in mainstream cinema. I would have liked to seen either gritty camera work and lighting throughout, or clean and polished throughout. It's a bit hodge-podge. I am not confident he understood the theme himself.I may watch it again on DVD when it hits the stores. The loose ends in the film may not bother me so much 2nd time around, ie old mother-in-law, the other captives, the children left behind etc.Well, I enjoyed some parts of the movie such as the authenticity of the actors (real people) and location shoot, but I am a little disappointed in the overall treatment. Or perhaps I'm just being too critical and should lighten up.",Apocalypto
980,ramon-ackermann,waste of time,1,21 January 2007,"I already knew that there were mistakes, factual and historical, in the movie before I went to see it, nevertheless, I wanted to see what it was all about. I knew we're going to see the fastest eclipse (2 minutes) in history and I already knew that we're going to see the Spaniards arrive when in fact there are about 1600 years between the end of the Maya and the arrival of the Europeans. But this movie depicts the Mayan as brutal, barbarian people and totally disregards their highly developed society.So basically the movie contains 10 minutes hunting, 80 minutes of walking through the jungle, 30 minutes of slaughtering and another 60 minutes of running through the forest. So if you're interested in how the Mayans really might have been, better look at something else. I really miss a remark in the movie that this is totally fictional and is not based on research.",Apocalypto
981,alexshak,Mel Gibson IS a crime against humanity,1,22 January 2007,"Tonight I went on the advice of someone who's opinion I respect and appreciate to see Mel Gibson's new film Apocalypto. On the off chance you may really want to see this film stop reading as this may ""spoil"" the plot.Although I must use the word sparingly as there is next to nothing to spoil. There are no characters, they never develop any individual natures at all and fit the 2 dimensional cutouts of any action film - ""Hero"" ""Victim"" ""Villain"" ""Henchman"" ""Goofy Sidekick"" ""Cute kid"" and ""wise old man"". No one has any other than the most rudimentary of backgrounds and we never learn anything unique about anyone.Then there is the plot. We have a hero fighting against the big bad invaders who destroyed his village lost him his woman and killed his dad. To escape them he is helped out by a diseased girl with prophesies the future, an eclipse, the animals of the forest and by leaping over a giant waterfall. In the end the bad guy dies, he gets his woman and saves the cute kid and learns an simple lesson about himself - don't be afraid.Sound familiar? Damn straight. Essentially if you put this film in English and took it out of South America it could have starred the Schwarzer, Van Dam or if you left it in the jungle and added the American army, Stallone. Its full of meaningless macho posturing and cheesy one liners.Then there is the abject violence. many people criticised the Passion of the Christ on this point, however at least that served a purpose, at least there was some real reason to explore what it would be like to make that big a sacrifice. This film is just stupidly violent, and I 'm not talking about the human sacrifice as that is part and parcel with South and Central America. I'm talking about the fight scenes that go for the stupidest, most violent gore that even the best 80s shock horror would be proud of. Arteries that pulse blood out of people's head's etc.But what top's it off is the lesson Mel lays down. Throughout the film all the native characters are made to look as demonic as possible, taking the piercing and tattoo culture of South America and constructing it to reflect Christian symbolism of the devil. The hero runs through pits of the dead reflecting all the middle age ideas of hell. I can hear people say ""but Alex Mel was telling it how it was, it was an culture that was really into human sacrifice"" and thats valid except Mel makes no effort to explore why this is or to go into the nature of the culture at all simply portraying as vile and demonic. Right at the end the Spanish arrive rowing to the shore where the hero stands, in the boat is a Christian Monk with a large crucifix held above his head.So what do we learn from Mel's Monstrosity? That before the Christians came to South America everyone was a violent and ugly heathen, without compassion or a soul and everyone heartlessly killed everyone and even the good people where lost and uncaring. You can just feel all the of conservative Christians of the world who loved the passion going to this film and confirming all there beleifs that people out there are bad and evil and we are the blessed who have it right.This may not have been Mel's intention, he makes some a clear statement that the decadence of any culture can tear it apart. However thats only there for the those willing to dig deeper and the surface reading constructs an image which is reinforces small minded thinking.Structurally a bad film, and incredibly irresponsible and meaningless graphic content. Wouldn't mind half so much if it just was entertainment but the fact Mel uses it to preach an agenda really gets my back up.Damn the Man, Save the Empire, Use the Internet to Soap Box your own Opinion,",Apocalypto

But Gibson lacks the talent.I didn't find the movie disgusting, not because it isn't (it is so on purpose) but because I have great tolerance. But there's horror and gore all over, with no purpose and just for the sake of horrifying, I guess.It's so unreal and incredible that it makes me want to cry.

984,schuna1,on a bus in the flips,8,29 January 2007,"I got on a bus from Manila to Los Baños in the Philippines and sat next to a woman who only spoke Tagalog. There was a movie playing on the set at the front of the bus. At first I thought it was a Filipino movie with some pretty lame effects (rubber heart ripped from a body) but then I began to think it had to be made for the US market as we watched it with two sets of subtitles - those on the film and CC - both in English and the language being spoken was not Tagalog. The woman sitting next to me was thoroughly engrossed in this film adding comments and suggestions to the actors in Tagalog. The movie obviously has universal appeal but when the Spanish show up at the end it really hit home with the audience on that bus. (I like how they play the ultimate ""heavy"" in the movie and never have to lift a finger.) The Philippines has cracked down on pirated CDs and DVDs but as this movie is not yet in theaters here obviously buses are exempt.

985,wwoodke,"Good movie, but not about the Mayans",9,27 July 2008,"I have read most of the posts here and agree that Mel Gibson was trying to use a Mesoamerican culture as a foil to the events of today's societies. However, I do wish to point out, as many other scholars have, the events of this film are completely inconsistent with what we know of Mayan culture and history. Most of the imagery and masks, not all, but most, are in fact from the Aztec civilization. Mayan's did indeed practice human sacrifice, but it was the Aztecs who rounded up members of remote villages and herded them back to be sold into slavery and ushered into the ranks of ""willing human sacrifices"".I did enjoy the film and do understand the ideas Mr. Gibson was trying to convey. That said, I think it is unfair and incorrect to label this film a depiction of the fall of the Mayan civilization. It is a fictitious account of what can happen to all civilizations, past, present and future, if we fail to learn the lessons of those who have gone before us.The Mayans are alive and well, as are descendants from the Incan and Aztecan cultures. Granted, small pox and other ""European"" atrocities decimated their numbers, but there are still places where you can experience and witness the vibrant culture and history that is a part of all ancient civilizations.Let's not tarnish a great culture and civilization simply to make the point that our own is at grave risk.",Apocalypto
986,maimonide-1,"Brilliant technically, with a few doubts about content and story",8,2 February 2007,"After the Passion, I have serious doubts about Gibson's impartiality to any subject, so I was watching like a hawk for anything of the sort. Also because of the Passion, I pretty much thought technical excellence is guaranteed. I was right on the second count, but on the first, it was very hard to determine what partial ideology he was pushing, if any. There was just stuff that bothered me on a few counts. No doubt about it, if you have no exposure to the kind of life the Mesoamericans were leading, you will be shocked, but I don't think you'll be able to stop watching. It was hard finding any technical details that were wrong in this movie. The pains they went to in order to depict life in that world are incredible. The acting is incredible too, by the way. The costumes, the hairdos, the facial features of the actors and extras, the fighting, the unbroken stream of native language, the body adornments, the tools and weapons, everything looks flawless. I don't think people are even gonna notice they are reading subtitles, and I hope they accurately render Mayan, which, as far as I know, is still the native language for quite a few people. However, some depictions bothered me, because, as Gibson is likely to do, he pulled some serious black and white characters out of his hat, and serious black and white depictions of urban Mayan life. I guess he may be excused on only one count, which is the obvious intent of the movie to push the Noble Savage idea. In spite of this, he managed to have the characters be incredibly vivid and human, but only if they are good guys. The bad guys are worse than the mutants in The Hills Have Eyes, BUT, fortunately, they also support a very important point. The point is that life for those people was incredibly brutal and raw, when it came to conflict, and they had some habits and traditions for which we put people away in high security loony bins for life nowadays. Spoiler alert!! (kind of) (don't read if you want an innocent experience). From my point of view, the story suffered because it starts off great, and towards the end it turns into Rambo. However, that too was handled quite well, because Rambo had all the answers, and that is not the case here, the character is much more realistic in terms of what one guy can do by himself. Another problem, but that won't bother most people, is that the movie is clearly a case of the Noble Savage, where the villagers are kinda tough, but have a great life, and the city folk are horrible. This leads to the next issue, that of the city leaders being a bunch of callous, manipulative bastards with a serious sadistic streak. Far as I know, human sacrifice was a matter of religious ritual, and while the frequent practice of it may have encouraged some questionable behavior in some priests, I don't think that is uncommon to people with that kind of power, and it is not the norm (see the recent Catholic scandals, speaking of Gibson). This leads me to a serious suspicion, that somehow he wanted to show how ""paganism"" can lead to atrocity. I apologize to him here personally if that is not the case, but somehow I can't shake that feeling. The Passion was unbelievably simplistic and manipulative and misleading on this topic, so I'm sorry, but I can't help but suspect him of trying to make a point. It almost led me to believe that he depicted the coming of the Spanish ships as a sort of chance for the natives to get their act straight, but I don't think even he could stoop that low, considering what the Conquistadors did in the name of the cross (gilded with the gold of the ""pagans"" they terrorized, incidentally). It occurs to me now that he may have even tried to suggest, in a seriously twisted way, that the coming of the Spanish was divine retribution for their trespasses. But that is speculation. He may have just thrown that in to pin the plot in time, to show us how close that barbarism was to our own time. Overall, an excellent experience, slightly marred by simplistic stuff that is the mark of Hollywood, not independent movie makers with awesome budgets and a mission to tell it like it is. I recommend it for a totally original movie experience. I commend everyone involved in it for a great job.",Apocalypto

Wish there were more of them. Historically, the movie is set over the entire range of Maya history, and actually even adds in Aztec history. There are NO Maya temples which feature an altar for sacrifice in the known Maya world other than at Chichen Itza, which is a site greatly influenced by the Mexica people!!!!! I would like to see a movie made about these spectacular people and there civilization that was more accurate, there are MANY stories being deciphered as I write this!!

Again, a great movie, spectacular acting, directing and cinematography, but if someone made a lie movie about the United States in the future, we would all be depicted as ruthless killer and warmongers, and while there are many like that, it would be a very unfair depiction.

The funny thing was days after I saw the film it suddenly hit me, The whole plot of the film surrounds this extra human effort that the character named ""Almost"" in the film, makes to return and save his family,who he manages to save, left abandoned in a pit after a ruthless tribe attacks and destroys their village. To be very critical about perhaps a small minor but in my opinion major point in this film, it completely baffles me why on earth, when he returns after surviving endless trials and tribulations, the part which the whole film is based is totally skipped ( saving his family from the pit).It actually doesn't show you that!

991,kasper-skov,One of the best films to come out on DVD this year,8,5 June 2007,"My friend Marcus recently posted a mini-review of Mel Gibson's new film Apocalypto and then I remembered that I actually had it lying around on DVD but never got to watch it. So yesterday evening my brother and I decided to check it out. So here's my thoughts.The film started off by surprising me with the language used, Mayan. I actually thought that they would be speaking English but I was wrong - lucky. The choice of using Mayan is great and it makes the whole experience of the film really authentic together with the sites where the film is shot and the great costumes (I especially like the ""helmet"" that Zero Wolf, played by Raoul Trujillo, wears), and it's not just the clothes but also the scars and ""tattoos"" that the natives has on their bodies. The film is gory as hell, even gorier than Conan the Barbarian which is fine with me but some might not like this. But hey, that's probably how it was like back then with all the sacrificing and war between tribes etc.The film is almost too long with a runtime of 139 min. They could easily have cut down the chase scene with 10 min without actually hurting the overall film. It is still one of the best scenes in the film, even because of it being just a bit too long. Two other scenes which I really enjoyed was the prophecy scene, where a little cursed girl is making a prophecy which in some way proofs to be true later in the film (hope that I didn't spoil anything there), and the big sacrifice scene at the Aztecs.While on the subject of the Aztecs, isn't it a little weird that the Aztecs know the Mayan language and even use it among their own, though they actually had their own called Nahuatl ? Lastly the film really tricked me a few times. E.g. I was so certain throughout the whole film that the fugitives in the start of the film would come and help Jaguar Paw in the chase scene, but nah, didn't happen.Overall a great film; great settings, great feel, good acting from most of the actors and a great story. Will definitely get this one on blu-ray when I get hold of a new HDTV, just to watch the jungle and the Aztec city in all their glory! 8/10",Apocalypto

993,cla5-1,An Inspring Story with Ample Religious Implications,9,17 February 2007,"Although it has received its fair share of criticism, Gibson's 'Apocalypto' is esoterically misunderstood. The film has both explicit and sub-textual thematic development -- especially themes dealing with apocalyptic expression and foreshadowing in the realm of Christianity. Jaguar Paw is, obviously, symbolic of the 'Christ-figure' that Gibson is reputable for emanating in his work, and the protagonist's story of struggle and divine intervention clearly radiates Gibson's intentions that correspond to dogmatics in Revelation.Aside from the thought-provoking thematic context, 'Apocalypto' is cinematically and aesthetically powerful with the action-driven chase sequence (though universally criticized for its excessive length), its beautiful and unique cinematography throughout the Central American landscape, and an established conflict that holds the audience's fixation on the plot.

996,malibuth,Breathtaking film by Hollywood's most talented producer,10,27 June 2007,"Mel Gibson has created a masterpiece. This was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in MONTHS. Ya' gotta admit... Hollywood is running out of ideas... That is why we keep seeing not only sequels, but PREquels. Mel Gibson knows how to deliver. I am a 23 year old female who hates movies that seek to nauseate the audience with gruesome & bloody scenes... This movie did not do that though. It is no harsher than Braveheart or even Passion of the Christ. Apocalypto was fabulous! Sure, there were some pretty intense scenes, but the movie would not have been complete without them. It's what helps tells the story. Apocalypto is a TRUE piece of art, a TRUE storyline, TRUE acting, TRUE suspense, TRUE feelings.... The BEST movie I have seen in a realllllyyyyyy long time. Those 2 hours are the best 2 hours you will spend watching a movie. If you want a movie that will put you at the edge of your seat in suspense... a movie that gets you involved & entertains like none other - with an eventful & meanfingful storyline, see Apocalypto!! FABULOUS. I can't wait to see how Mel Gibson's next project turns out.",Apocalypto
997,nsangoma,underlying theme...,8,3 April 2007,"I don't have the time to read all 70 pages of comments to see if someone else came up with my theory... Mel Gibson, being a very traditional (conservative) Catholic, would be incensed by the argument that the arrival of Christianity introduced violence, slavery and oppression into the otherwise peaceful civilizations of the pre-contact ""New World""... The movie basically suggests that the civilizations present in the Americas prior to contact were just as violent - and even more so - than the Spanish Conquistadores... In fact - just watching the colonizers come ashore halts the attempt to murder the poor campesino... The ""Apocalypto"" is the end of the violent world of the indigenous - brought about by the providential arrival of Christianity... Hallelujah!",Apocalypto

I believe that if one handles fear the right way, situations, circumstances will also work in ones favour.You see ancient wisdom, conquering fear, and a fact that evil may triumph for seemingly eons but surely good will overcome at the long last.I watched the film without having a prior knowledge of the writer/producer, I must say I love the film.

Though it must be handed to the director that it is not the sadistic kind of movie. So this movie is not the kinda of one you want to go with your friends to have some good time. The gore levels are obscenely high and I for one could not understand the point of the movie.Now that the rant is out of the way, one must appreciate the photography in the movie.

Apocalypto is absolutely heart stopping with the nonstop action and suspense that keeps you on your toes the entire film. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and amazing!! Rudy Youngblood aka Jaguar Paw is a mesmerizing actor. He fits the lead role better than anybody else could with his presence and beauty and his beautiful eyes can capture anybody.

1001,damien-hoffman,Depicts Mayans as Animals compared to sacred Passion of the Christ,3,23 May 2007,"On the surface, this movie has great action and costumes. However, after viewing The Passion of the Christ, you will quickly notice how the Mayans are juxtaposed with the spiritual and civilized Christians in The Passion. If you know anything about Mayan history and their deep rooted spirituality, this movie is very disappointing and misinformed. The first scene depicts the Mayans like modern ignorant fraternity brothers playing stupid jokes on one another, and it gets worse from there.Given how many ""fans"" of The Passion will see this movie, including family and friends of mine, this movie merely gives Christians reason to find the Mayans to be intellectually and spiritually inferior. I am not a conspiracy theorist by any means, but this was just too poor of a historical portrayal to be anything but an attempt to wane the increasing popularity of Mayan culture as we approach the year 2012.Gibson is a great film maker, but his content is as deluded as his personal day dreams and fantasies. His research doesn't pass the laugh test. I'm very sad that this movie will inform most Christians about a beautiful culture that had its own problems with power and greed, much like every other civilization since.",Apocalypto

There are a lot of pointless and boring events. The characters were introduced in a pretty bad manner. The main character was first showed as a mean guy, then he was the hearty guy only 10 minutes later.I also had close to no excitement watching this movie. Anything that was happening I could predict.Overall a pretty bad movie with some decent action scenes.

1003,davidmagnusalexander,Perfect Allegory on Human Condition,8,14 October 2007,"Apocalypto is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've watched it recently and I can't stop thinking about it.Parts of the film reminds me of a nature film on National Geographic, both in it's filming style and content: The Nature of the Human Animal and it's Society.It's not about a hero trying to avoid his fate, as much as an Allegory about the Human Condition. How we have been at each other's throat from the beginning of time. The use of murder, slavery, genocide and religion, all as means of repression and control.During the entire movie we see only two ""primitive"" civilizations and the clash between them. And at the end, when we think it's all over, we see another tribe coming to join the blood bath: the Spanish Conquistadors. And we all know what happened then: Murder, Slavery, Genocide and use of Religion to control the population.The film left me with a pessimistic thought in my mind, as I see today's news and think that not much has changed. Only our weapons got better. The Film also comes as a contrast to the common romantic notion that once, when life was simpler and we lived closer to nature, people were nicer to each other. It was not so! Definitely not the common romantic notion Hollywood presents in most of it's films.I give it a nine and not ten, only because of some ""over doing it"". The film is meant to shock (which it does) and does not show a real historic facts. Again, it's an allegory and not a history lesson.Good job Mel. I never thought you had it in you.",Apocalypto
1004,r_a_e_z1,Could have been a masterpiece,7,29 May 2007,"Gibson could have done a masterpiece focusing in the Mayan civilization at it's best, and not only show the brutality of it's culture. Yes, I agree that the Mayas had a violent way to express they're religious beliefs, but, what happened to the astronomical aspect of the civilization, architecture, medicine, sports, i mean...that's what's worth to see!!!! I saw this movie because I always wanted to see a movie that could show a Mayan city with it's social, cultural, scientific and politic development,this one could have done that, but instead shows only the brutal aspect of the culture. I believe that this movie should have been a story around the Mayan civilization and not the Mayan civilization around a common love story. That's what disappoints me from my personal point of view. I rated it with 7 out of 10 because of the effort put in the wardrobe and it's original spoken language, as well as its cinematography, acting and special effects. It works for someone who does not knows what the Mayan Civilization was all about. If this movie would have been spoken in English it would have been just one more movie just like ""Rapa Nui"". By the way those lands were not conquered by Spanish fleets for up to 500-600 years after Mayan Civilizatin disappeared, if I'm not wrong.

1005,jasonpowell82,Best Prequel of All Time,9,31 May 2007,"This is one of the best pre-quels ever made, but a lot of people don't realize it or understand its significance. You see, the word ""Apocalypto"" is actually Mayan for ""Surviving the Game"", and the name ""Jaguar Paw"" in that culture is literally translated to ""Ice-T"". In both of these films, the main character is taken into a foreign environment and then hunted like an animal. I think this is representative of what we as human beings truly are at heart... animals, sometimes rappers. The temples symbolize when you are at the top of the rap game, and how you have to eat other rappers' hearts to survive. Eventually, the same people who bring you in the game chase you back to where you came, just how Jaguar Paw, a.k.a. Ice-T, was treated. The savages who ransacked Jaguar Paw's village can easily be interchanged with those of ""Surviving the Game"" ( e.g. Gary Busey, the guy from Roc & the guy from Scrubs) They are vicious, but you can use your cunning to defeat them because they are stupid. So whether you shoot poison darts at them or stick a tube from the gas tank of a quad to its ignition, the instinct to survive is manifest. Luckily, both films have happy endings, Jaguar Paw gets back to his wife and kid in the hole filled with water who apparently don't know how to swim, and Ice-T gets back on da block and remains true to his hardcore, Mad Dog sippin' life on the streets. The days are a little darker, but at least they both survived to spit another 16.",Apocalypto

To all those historians who gave this movie 1 star because it was all ""lies"" and ""the Spaniards came a hundred years later"" and ""Mel's confusing the cultures of Mayan and Aztec"", go read in the library and don't come out until you have enough facts to satisfy you with. It's like you guys came right out of Mexican history class and saw this movie. I'm an intelligent college student taking history classes and I'm pretty sure a lot of us do not and will not ever learn about the history of Mayan civilization. And that's OK. I mean, I did not rent this film to educate myself on Mayan civilization. I rented it to be entertained. That's what movies do. If I want to educate myself on Mayan culture, I'll go to the library. It's silly to watch this movie and then instantly think I know everything about this culture. I might as well believe that there really is an island out there with real dinosaurs on it! So I guess you guys really wish you hadn't seen the film considering all your historical critiques, but I, for one, am very glad I watched it. This movie really inspired me and made me think about civilization in general, the human sacrifice of the past.I think people these days get so caught up in society that we forget about earlier generations, civilizations, cultures. Sure, it's good to educate yourself with this knowledge, but somehow, history class can come with no emotion attached. I feel grateful and very blessed to have internet access, a home, a family, and a civilization where I'm not afraid.

The issue is now that to give a comment I have to write 10 lines of text according to someone. what else can you say about a movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth..? Can a movie be made that truly reflects the immense knowledge from this culture and sell? or should it be made as a documentary to be shown in the History Channel with less viewers? or should it be left to Apocalypto to enlighten the minds of the people that travel to the Mayan Riviera for a vacation thinking that the Mayan civilization was a blood seeking one, a warrior, destroyer...maybe Mel got confused with the Mexica (Aztec) one and chose the wrong location.

Makes some of the other recent 'historical epics' like Alexander and 300 look plain silly. Must see film!Apocalypto's cinematography is stunning. The scenery is a breathe of fresh air. The fatalities are unique and original unlike 300 where all they do is stab/slash each other about a million times and squirt fake CGI blood all over in mindless killing. The end is shocking but very appropriate. After running for his life and surviving through hell, Jaguar Paw cannot outrun his destiny. Kind of leaves it open-ended similar to how the Sopranos ended.

I hate people who write their comments just because they don't like a director or somebody from the movie crew.That's why I always watch other movies of a director I'm going to comment on. This time it was Braveheart. Once more.After watching one of my favorite historical-fiction movies, I decided to go on - and started the Apocalypto.After 15 minutes of the seance, I got the feeling that something was terribly wrong. Something was missing. Indeed, the actors were using real language and the costumes were quite nice , but ... for someone interested in history it all seemed fake.First of all, Indian tribes in South America weren't as blood thirsty as Mel Gibson and his crew wanted them to be. Yes, they knew the institution of sacrifice but it was mostly about plants, vegetables and fruits. It was unusual to sacrifice animals, not mentioning living people. It happened hardly ever, on special occasions.Secondly, I could even withstand the historical irregularities served by the movie ( lots of them ) , if it wasn't for the simple, boorish plot line. It bored me. It shocked me with its simplicity. This movie could do as a tale for kids ... again, if it wasn't for the amount of blood flowing through it.",Apocalypto

I know these things happened because I have read about them but to actually see them played out is breath-taking. The film was startling and brutal but war is that way. We need more films that do not glorify invading other cultures and gives us a better ""feel"" of the value of life. I also liked that Gibson gave a human quality to the players.

The portrayal of the Mayan city is majestic. However, what might have been a rating of 9 or 10 is clouded by formulaic and corny writing. Unnecessary one-liners (ie. ""I'm walking here"", ""He's f@#$ed""), overly stereotypical character treatments and pointless plot twists take the ""realistic"" edge off of a strong historical backdrop. I know this sounds very critical but I was frustrated at how well it began (I mean, a story about the Mayan civilization is just genius) and how quickly it deteriorated into standard Hollywood. Gibson's direction is amazing here but the writing is a bit too much like Lethal Weapon for the period IMHO.",Apocalypto

Although its a subtitled film, by the end I didn't even realise I was reading the subtitles as it is such an engrossing movie and I truly believe it would not have worked as well had the dialogue been in plain old English.I completely echo the sentiment of all the other positive comments here i.e. breathtaking scenery and camera-work. In addition to this I felt the casting and acting was spot-on, especially since a lot of the actors were unknown and probably relatively inexperienced.Through a combination of great acting, casting and cinematography, the movie really provides to the viewer, a true sense of the nature of the emotions that Jaguar Paw and his friends are experiencing throughout their ordeal.Maximum credit to Mel Gibson for having the balls to do a film like this. Personally I can't wait to see this film again one day, but in Hi-Definition... i'm pretty sure it would be even more-so breathtaking!!",Apocalypto
1014,bleemer_27,"""Apocalypto: the Story of a True Soldier""",8,24 September 2007,"Apocalypto is a very violent but beautiful piece of art, written by the Mel Gibson. Throughout the movie, it seems as if there is no particular point to the film. However, the writer did a great job dividing the violence and suffering up with the joy and happiness. It seemed as if nothing could possibly go right until the story hit its climax. After it hits, the story changes and seems as if only good can happen. One main message that came to me, the viewer, throughout the film was that of courage for survival and the willingness to never give up.The setting for this film is in the jungle somewhere near Mexico. The story is about a small tribe of Mayans, living their own ways of life away from the main Mayan empire, until they are suddenly captured and destroyed by the barbaric Mayans. The men are separated from their wives and children, then taken on a long and strenuous voyage were they would be sacrificed to the gods, which would stop the drought that has devastated the Mayan land for many days. The main characters name, is Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood). He hides his pregnant wife and son before he is captured. When the story begins to reach its climax, he struggles free with the help of nature which would soon lead to his return to his wife and son. Throughout his struggle home, he ran into many problems. When he returned, his son and wife were both in trouble, but Jaguar Paw arrived just in time to save them as well.One reason why I like this movie so much is that it is full of action and art. The scenes are full of color. The story is presented in a language that seems to be Mayan, which made it even more interesting to read the subscript at the bottom. Another reason why I enjoy this film is because it ended in a happy way. The writer of the story kept the viewers' attention by showing a strong, and powerful, struggle to survive by a young man. After all the violence, who would ever think it would have such a strong and emotional ending? The plot of the story fits great with the critical technique because there are beautiful pictures and amazing colors in his struggle home. This is one reason I kept watching the movie.",Apocalypto

I read some reviews on this website stating that this movie is Mel Gibson's masterpiece. I guess those people are also people that think that Rob Zombie makes quality film. I am sure that there was some redeeming parts of this film. I however could not make it to them. After two hours of nonstop blood, torture, and gore in ways that I had never even considered possible, I just gave up.

I could be a total retard and go on about the brutal violence, but I personally thought it was on the same level of violence as Braveheart. The beginning is awesome, showing Jaguar Paw's village--the very thing he's determined to save. The next part, when the Holcanes pillage, rape, and kill, is sad, but the next half-hour makes you want to take off to the Yucatan Penninsula and see the breathtaking locations Gibson and production designer Tom Sanders used for this mesmerizing action movie. Dean Semler's cinematography is stunning, especially the sweeping shot right before Jaguar Paw jumps over the waterfall. Raoul Trujillo (Zero Wolf), Rodolfo Palacios (Snake Ink), and Gerardo Taracena (Middle Eye) are the best villains I've seen in years. Rudy Youngblood and Dalia Hernandez give outstanding performances, and Jim Horner's score is definitely with considering buying. Don't buy the lies about the overwhelming gore. Everyone's making such a fuss because they don't want to give a Gibson flick a good review. Don't get me wrong it IS violent and definitely worth an R rating, but not so it distorts any point Gibson hopes to make. This is my favorite movie of 2006 and I'm planning to get it.

I actually didn't even hear what Mel Gibson said when he was drunk, but I think he's seriously gone insane. I had to stifle laughter during this movie several times because of how out of place and inappropriate many events were for the focus of the film.At the beginning of the movie when it starts getting you into the story (without making this a spoiler) I found that there was little if any attempt to draw me into the feeling of the story. The events that happened that were supposed to make you feel horrible for the characters just made me try to figure out if I should feel bad for them in the first place. It didn't go into their life in the civilization, anything about how they interacted except how to kill an animal and how to give mean and out-of-place sex tips to the impotent member of the tribe.The movie was clunky, misshapen, and led nowhere.

It is full of graphic testosterone-fuelled bloodthirsty violence, the vast majority of which is totally unnecessary. The plot was almost non existent. The budget appeared to run out towards the end where both the plot and the special gore effects turned into comedy effects.

The only redeeming quality of this movie is the promise that the European invaders arriving at the end of the movie are about to engage in a genocide of the terrible actors that didn't get slaughtered in the course of the movie. I'm not sure if I've ever been so bored and offended for such an extended period of time.

In fact I can't believe I didn't shut it off after the first ten minutes. I guess I was waiting for a spaceship full of lactating lesbians to land and transport them into an episode of South Park.The ignorance of Mayan culture (or for that matter any Native American culture) is replete with the usual western presumptions. The protagonist Mayans are portrayed as a small tribe of hunters living in a remote jungle. The antagonists are portrayed as a horde of blood thirsty savages. It becomes especially ludicrous to portray these two lifestyles as co-existing. Additionally, the visual appearance of the Mayans, especially the heavily tattooed antagonists would be better suited to a low budget horror movie.Some of the worst negative elements of western culture are erroneously given to the Mayans. A mother-in-law of one of the tribe members is given the attributes of being a nagging shrew. Captives are sold at a slave auction. Decapitations.The final groaner is the ending. The appearance of the Nina, Pinta & Santa Maria. Might have been more accurate if they made it the Vikings.",Apocalypto
1024,ataoezev,"Nice Subject, Bad Movie",5,23 March 2007,"One expects more to acknowledge about the Mayan culture, the science, the knowledge and of course the contrast of these and the sacrifices. - One expects more from a ultra high production, except for the sacrifice scenes, there is no reason for watching it in the cinema. - Too many goofs, very embassasing: a) just one of the kidnappers gets beebites: interesting and cheap b) one cannot get out of the swamp alone that way c) the hesitation before the fall is too long, i know it's cinematic time but still d) the man they meet in the forest and wants a ""new beginning"" escaped as far as i understood, why is he taken hostage again? e) etc etc",Apocalypto
1025,janchrisdeur,Morality Tale,9,5 January 2008,"This move, to me, was a sort of morality play about Mayan civilization. When that civilization reached a point where individual human lives could be sacrificed for the supposed ""greater good"", the end was near. Spellbinding story, great camera work, and gripping plot. Gory and bloody...yes...not for the squeamish. But, a first-class movie. Mel Gibson may have warts and flaws as a human being (as do we all) but he makes great epic movies. I was intrigued by the ending, which I won't divulge, but I am wondering if that could be a lead-in for a second movie on the decline of Mayan civilization? I, for one, would be delighted to see a sequel dealing with the clash of the Mayans and the white man's civilizations.",Apocalypto

The dialog was SO corny at every moment. The acting was horrendous as well. Especially the role of the lead antagonist. It was entertaining to an extent, Ill say that. But if I could go back and have an opportunity to not watch this movie, I would gladly exchange my two hours for a chance to view a real movie. This movie was nothing more then a Hollywood glorification at the simple life of the tribes folk. Mel Gibson is not only a jerk, but an air head as well. This movie reminded me a lot of Scientology... it was really full of crap.",Apocalypto

Favorite Movie All Time.I never saw such kind of action movie in my life.Loved Comments personally thought this movie was outstanding. I loved the make-up and costume. It makes it all seem like a real tribe. I would like to go see this again because i just loved so very much. Mel Ginson made a very great movie for us. The actors were great too. Some i knew from Spanish shows. It was a smart, funny, heart thumping and great detailed movie. the ideas and Special effects were just VERY good work and...i just LOVED IT. I really want to go see it again. Mel Gibson was just really smart about this movie. He chose a lot of great actors. My whole family loved it and said that is was very good. and the foreign language was interesting. and by that i mean great. I never really thought of a movie about the Maya civilization. Yet this movie made me think a lot about the stuff that the people did to the Indians. I thought it was wrong to just take over the land that they had already owned. And again, i just really love this move and i thought it is very great Thanks Om",Apocalypto
1028,RobertPanico,Mystical and Exciting,10,5 December 2006,"First off, let me start by saying that if anyone's boycotting this film because Mel Gibson shouted something while drunk, then you're missing out on seeing an amazing work of film art. Many other filmmakers and actors say things, Mel's not the first. Please be mature and look past a few drunken words and experience a great film. ANYWAY, moving on.A recurring theme seen in Mel Gibson's films (Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ, and Apocalypto) is about how violent and primal the human condition really is. In each film we see how in many different cultures, each has it's good and its terrible side, which is still true of every culture on Earth to this day.Apocalypto can be broken down into two parts, the turning point, symbolically, is the eclipse. In the first half, we find Jaguar Paw in his native village and he is captured by warriors from the Mayan empire and is in line to be sacrificed. The second half is Jaguar Paw running form these warriors after escaping and trying to get back to his pregnant wife and child, who were lowered into a cave int he first half.Comparing the violence in The Passion to this, this felt very tame. The level of violence was on par with Braveheart, I felt. It was very appropriately used and medically accurate. The art design, as usual with a Gibson film, is among the best I have ever seen. Everything seems worn, real, and not like it came out of a costume factory. The sets and costumes were very exotic and amazing to view. The plot wasn't very complicated. The in my opinion, the prophecy scene with the little girl tied the whole film together by adding a sense of mysticism. I also enjoyed the brief scenes with the Mayan general and his son, it added a whole new layer to the antagonists, something we rarely see these days.Some thought that the inclusion of the Spanish at the end of the film was abrupt and out of nowhere, but think about this. The smallpox seen with the girl and the mentioning of the Great Plague is all due to the Spanish. That is why it is the decline of an Empire.The only thing I can complain about is the music. I've never been a huge fan of Horner and in my opinion John Debney should have been used after a powerful score like The Passion.This film was very well done and both intriguing and exciting to watch. Mel Gibson did a fantastic job as a director and should be noted as not a person who said a few words, but an important and passionate director.",Apocalypto
1029,jason-wilder-2,Good film,9,28 July 2008,"I've watched this movie twice. The first time I thought it was pretty gory, but enjoyed the end. The second time it was even better. I 've read a few posts here who said they saw it in the theater and everyone booed! I can't imagine that, I mean it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but ""booed"" C'mon! Also who cares if it's historically accurate, no one really has a crystal clear idea of what happened to the Mayan people. I think there were some good messages in the movie, like living within your means, empty religion vs. real relationships with God, environmental, the contrast between the jungle tribe vs. the people in the Mayan city. Also, I didn't really mind the subtitles, because most of the time they were short and too the point, you didn't have two full lines across the screen to read and try to comprehend, before he next dialog started. All in all, if you don't mind the blood (which by the way I think was important to show), I think you'll like the movie if you don't watch it with a history book in one hand and a Mayan to English book in the other.",Apocalypto
1030,katrienertryckx,The ending is great,10,27 November 2008,"The whole movie is breathtaking. But it is the ending that contains a great lesson: While 2 tribes of the same nation are competing against each other, the real threat has just arrived: the Europeans... They murdered practically all of the native inhabitants and broth different illnesses to the continent. This is where the real massacre took place!Some people say this movie is too violent. But it's not. In this fashion the viewer can experience all the pain that is done to the people of the forest. And so the viewer is perhaps confronted with the past of his own nation.And the music contains so much pain. I can hear it say : what have you done to us? what did we, natives, do to deserve all of this blood shedding?The Indian spirit must stay alive!!!",Apocalypto
1031,jonathanhirsh,It could have been an good film,1,10 December 2006,"If he had not subtitled it, I believe I would have enjoyed it. The subtitles were so euro-centric, which made them unbearable. Using such euro / catholic based words in the subtitles took what could have been a great story of a culture and turned it into a Hollywood revenge pic. Using the F&*@ word and the word Hell, truly is offensive to the cultures this film is about. You cannot tell the tale of a culture and then turn around and infuse your own thoughts about religion or language into it. Hell was not a concept for that society; they may have had there own afterlife views but Hell in the euro sense was not it. Mr. Gibson research the languages you try to translate or don't make the film.",Apocalypto
1032,reganlaura,"Breathtaking, Ferocious, Thrilling - I'm going back for a 2nd time!",10,9 December 2006,"Apocalypto is the most visually absorbing and exciting film I've ever seen. It transports you into the entirely unfamiliar world of ""Jaguar Paw"" (the main character) and his village, which is both a beautiful and brutal one. The story is based on this man's fierce will to protect his family... a desire which transcends language, geography and time. The action that ensues is nonstop and harrowing, as we root for him against impossible odds. Jaguar Paw's journey forces him to leave his innocence behind.. and as he becomes a man to be reckoned with, the strength of his presence is undeniable. I've never heard such intense reaction from a movie audience - it was like the people in the theater lived and died with the characters. There are some funny moments where everyone is relieved to laugh, but mostly they are cheering for Jaguar Paw and clapping at his every success. I can't wait to go back and see it all again.",Apocalypto

1034,kevindillard,Thrilling,9,19 June 2012,"Absolutely thrilling movie with non-stop action. But what thrilled me most was not the action. It was the blunt portrayal of a violent culture, and an acknowledgement that slavery, violence, and war were part of many cultures years ago. I'm sure the Hollywood critics hated this movie since Gibson made it and they fail to see fault in any culture other than mainstream white America. People who think it's too violent are sticking their head in the sand as far as what it was like to live in many time periods throughout history. This really is a historically significant movie that unfortunately will probably not get the credit it deserves.",Apocalypto
1035,mpm13,Apocalyptos Stunning Visuals Add Backdrop to An Average Story,6,9 December 2006,"Apocalypto displays incredible visuals of a lost culture, the cinematography is fantastic. An opening quote speaks of cultures collapsing only after they have destroyed themselves from within. Unfortunately, this quote and the movies title Apocalypto show very little significance to the movie itself.There are no discussions between Mayan rulers and their critics concerning this culture destroying itself at all. For the most part the Mayan leadership are only seen visually in the film as a brutal group with no opportunity to explain their thought process or beliefs.Instead this film at its core is really about a native being hunted with the Mayan culture as it's backdrop. The main character and his captor are both well played and interesting, however there are a lot of lost opportunities for better character development and story lines surrounding these two leading actors.Overall the films title makes a much bigger statement than the film can live up to. The film is worth seeing for all of its stunning visuals though offers no powerful statements and keeps the audience at a distance from the Mayan empire--making it a little disappointing for an audience that was hoping for a bigger history lesson.",Apocalypto
1036,krakfiend69,Not Worth the Hype,5,10 December 2006,"Wow. The hype for this movie was ridiculous. And it did not live up to it in any way at all.First off, I have no desire to put any money in Mel Gibson's pockets, but the movie interested me, neo-colonial, Christian overtones aside. The news frenzy about the amount of gore intrigued me more, so I decided it was worth the price of a ticket, even if that money was going to Gibson. So I went in, with actually kind of high expectations... Even though I am not a fan of Gibson, he has made good movies, and while he has certainly gotten crazier in the last few years, I had high hopes for the movie.Wow. What a let down.First off, the gore - This movie is NOT THAT BAD. Gibson has always had movies that were bloodier than their time, The Patriot and Braveheart being good examples. So the idea of him going extra gore is not too outlandish. But with critics commenting that it would take a disturbed man to put this amount of gore into a film, well, thats a lot to live up to. The gore in the movie is intermittent, and it is not all that unusual for similar genre movies. It is tame compared to some horror movies that were released in the last year. All the media frenzy about the gore was just that - media frenzy. It was hype built up to either a> make you see the movie or b>destroy what remains of Gibson's image, depending on whose camp you belong to. If you are expecting 2.5 hours of the flogging scene from ""The Passion..."" you are in for a rude awakening, because it rarely reaches that level of gore, and it is NEVER prolonged. I don't deny that I am desensitized to Hollywood gore and am a big fan of it, but I can still objectively recognize that this movie did not contain NEARLY as much stomach-churning gore as was publicized.And, to top it off, the movie is boring. Sure, there are good moments. But the story is painfully predictable and quite honestly worn out, and never mind that the dialogue is awful. Rudy Youngblood does a superb job in the movie, playing the silent warrior discovering strength as he battles his own fear... but it is not enough to save the film. The social commentary, if anyway, is trite and boring. The obvious Christian references and overtones, in conjunction with the obvious orientalist/colonial mindset that governed many decisions throughout the movie making process make the film even less interesting.I have seen far worse movies, I wont lie, but this is not one that I plan to add to my DVD library in the future. Not even with a pirated copy. There is such a frenzy about it, and it falls flat on its face. If you have an afternoon to kill then go ahead, you will get exactly what you expect and will not leave the theater having felt like you accomplished any sort of emotional or intellectual journey through the last 2.5 hours, but I suppose not everyone expects movies to be, well, worth something.",Apocalypto
1037,pantherprods,Naked Prey revisited,10,29 June 2007,"Let's face it, there are no original stories in Hollywood. Even Mel Gibson knows that mining old, forgotten movies for story material is par for the course. This film borrows heavily from ""The Naked Prey"" by Cornel Wilde. But, it's still a great homage and a good character study. This film combines elements of many old movies but is unique enough by its own standards to be an enjoyable production. Although camera moves, digital effects and production design make Mel's film more dynamic, exciting and in-step with todays audience, I recommend seeing ""Naked Prey"" if you missed it. I don't know if Wilde is still around to appreciate this but I'm sure the buzz will create some re-newed interest in his film.",Apocalypto
1038,SilverStreakRider,Excellent Movie but with one major flaw...,9,26 January 2010,"I have read a lot of the reviews on this movie and I just wanted to point out some major flaws and some very accurate depictions. When the Spanish under Cortez (I think) arrived in the Mexico area, it was the Aztec civilization which he conquered and destroyed not the Mayans (the Mayans civilization was much older than the Aztec and was already in sharp decline when the Spanish arrived. There were and still are remnants of Mayans still in Mexico area but it was still actually the Aztecs who were really not part of the Mayan group that were found & exploited by Spanish under Cortez. In South American it was the Incas (not part of the Mayan group) that were found and destroyed by Spanish (Pizarro). The depictions of the harsh violence and sacrifices where very accurate. Unlike what some have said here, these cultures often used captured victims from other tribes and group to perform sacrifices as well as simply to torture. They also used victims within there own tribes but this was mostly for very special religious ceremonies. The tortures they depicted are very accurate. Actually, they performed much worse types of torture and on hundreds of prisoners at a time. There is more than adequate evidence to proves their actions. Overall, I felt the film was excellent and unlike some, I find no real basis to belittle Mel Gibson as an actor or director. Like all of us, he is not perfect and has made some bad choices but it is only the ignorant and biased themselves that label him as a racists. We have all made or exercised some stupid actions when it comes to races and cultural differences and most of us have been deeply sorry for these errors ... this does not make us racists except to those few who think they are superior and above reproach, they need to take their heads out of their arses and take a long look at their own errors and faults.",Apocalypto

The beauty with which the movie has been carried you'll never feel like alien to the language used. Subtitles just spice up the moments. Live the movie and you'll surely love it. And may be sometime you might think of going to some jungle to explore it after watching this one.The chase sequence is simply the best and obviously the message movie conveys to give your best till you last is well carried. And yeah the eclipse scene reveals the level of superstition that prevailed earlier, which the rulers used to cast some wrong deed as the correct way of doing things.Brilliant performances, excellent screenplay, direction.

1040,fgreene,wasted my $4.00,3,21 June 2007,"Finally rented this and, even with the wonders of fast forwarding, it was still a nightmare.The technical filming is excellent but the plot (where there is one) is awful.Many scenes are blatantly stolen from other films, including Mr Gibsons. Saw snips from ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Rambo,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""Last of the Mohecans"" and (I think) ""Bringing Up Baby."" The sequencing made no sense at all. The hero is drug over several days to the ""the city,"" manages to escape and in only a matter of hours is back in his home. Meanwhile, his wife is trapped at the bottom of a well with no signs of starvation or dehydration.Whenever you get into a plot trap, bring out another miracle. Hero about to get his heart ripped out? Queue a solar eclipse. About to get chopped down by the bad guys? Bring on the panther. And, best of all, trapped by the remaining hunters, bring on the Spaniards.What a waste of time and money The suspension of disbelief required to track the plot",Apocalypto
1041,jmaster2345,don't listen to the critics,10,3 January 2011,"An absolutely amazing, brilliant, and breathtaking film. A true masterpiece. A great plot, breathtaking cinematography, great actors, the only disappointing thing about it was that it was a tad short. Everyone knows that when you're watching a boring or lackluster film then time tends to crawl, and you keep thinking, 'oh we're at the middle' or 'one more hour' or 'what the !$%# is this'...trust me...this film is nothing of the sort! From the very first scene Mel drags you into his story and you don't leave it till the ending credits roll...and even then I sat there mesmerized.One advantage I had going to see this movie was that I had no idea what the film was about nor did I see the trailer beforehand. So if you have someone you want to show this film to just sit them in front of the TV and press play.Don't pay any attention to Mel Gibson haters/critics who automatically hate the film because its by Mel.The violence is ENTIRELY justified in my opinion. Easily the best film of 2006. Definitely in my top ten films ever made.",Apocalypto
1042,drinknowater,One of the great story I ever seen,10,18 May 2011,"It isn't important that the facts are real or not. What it's awesome in this movie is the fact that the people in the jungle in 16 century can think exactly like us. It is important that a man can have the power to fight with the system. This is the beauty of this movie: a simple man can beat the system if he is determined enough. We support the Jaguar Paw all the movie and he manage to win. The story is very realistic, and beside a lot of Hollywood garbage, it is real story to look at. Thanks to Mell Gibson that he created a masterpiece like this movie. I don't know other movies of Mell Gibson but this is great. I hope he will direct another movie in the future.",Apocalypto
1043,SpiderWoman-1,Just saw APOCALYPTO,10,5 January 2007,"I find these kinds of movies highly interesting and not graphic at all, but an attempt to display the scenes and characters as accurately as possible. If that happens to be gruesome, so be it. The story must be told, as with ""Passion"". Gore is a part of reality for many countries and cultures. Maybe the viewers that were grossed out by these kinds of movies should get their nose out of their Nonfat Caramel Machiatos and smell the REAL coffee! The movie was awesome, and did not feel like the 2 hours plus it ran. Reading the text became second nature and the cinematography was expansive and beautifully lush.I can easily see why these types of movies grab Mr. Gibson, as they are gripping, heartwarming at times and play on the true nature of humans.I highly recommend it as well as look forward to owning it on DVD one day soon.",Apocalypto
1044,bradenskidmore,No Respect for Mayan Culture,3,16 September 2018,"This film is entertaining and has some great sequences in it. As a film it is entertaining and enjoyable. However this movie takes historical inaccuracy to another level. So much about Mayan culture is simply wrong in this film. A five minute Google search can tell you all about that. The movie is riddled with inaccuracies and misrepresents a civilization most people know very little about. Making a movie that misconstrues history to this level makes the audience dumber.The two biggest complaints I have pertain to the arrival of the Spanish. The fact that they show up at the end of the movie is completely wrong. If the Mayans died out in 900 A.D. then how are the Spanish there when they didn't get to the new world until 1519? This is absolutely inexcusable. I'm ok with minor changes for the sake of filmmaking but this is ridiculous.The second thing that bothers me is at the beginning of the movie as the prisoners are being taken to the city they see a sick child. The child obviously has smallpox which didn't exist in the new world until the Spanish got there, almost 600 years later. I love Mel Gibson and he knows how to make a good film. But his care for accurate representation of historical events is laughable. This movie misrepresents the Mayans and makes people dumber because they take this movie as an accurate representation of their civilization. The same issues can be found with Braveheart and The Patriot. Both great movies but not historically accurate at all.",Apocalypto
1045,rmt223,Shouldn't have waited so long before seeing this movie,8,11 August 2007,"Having read the reviews and hearing of the graphic violence in this, I was hesitant to watch it especially with my gf who is very sensitive to violent scenes in movies.Now that we've finally seen it and I have to kick myself for waiting so long.This movie almost makes up for the way Native Americans have been portrayed in movies during Hollywoods golden years. I used to watch the old western movies, where the heroes were the likes of Custer and villains were the Native Americans killing settlers and soldiers.Of course now we all know about the genocide that was the settling of the Americas. To this day I refuse to have anything to do with the Catholic religion, because it was forced on us by the missionairies. Because back then it was convert or die by being burned alive or whatever punishment they could come up with.If it weren't for a handful of priests all the written texts of the Mayas would have been burned in bonfires all because they were considered the work of the devil.I would love to see more movies like this where we are portrayed as fathers taking care of their families, protecting them from enemies and even giving up our lives to allow a friend to live on.",Apocalypto
1046,utexaskid,Flawed man directs flawless movie,10,15 December 2006,"First off Mel Gibson is a flawed man just like any of us and we should never tolerate racism, however to deny the man his talent over personal issues is to be ignorant. This man has brought western audiences in touch with history time and time again and he's not afraid to use languages foreign to our ears and peoples native to the culture of the subject matter. The tale itself is a timeless one that you will find in any culture or society. A young mans struggle to survive and struggle against the forces of those who would do him harm a classic struggle of good vs evil. This movie is not as gruesome as some reviewers are painting. I was worried I'd become ill after reading through some negative reviews but found that Gibson stays clear of any real gruesome close ups and pans the camera out when we see our poor victims sacrificed on the altar. If you're a history buff like myself you will be pleased with how accurate the sacrifice was, down to how the victim had clear sight of the emperor when laid back, where he was sliced, and how the heart was extracted and burned (Again its not too too bloody trust me). I know some historian types are up an arms arguing that Mayans were a more peaceful society and didn't raid villages and sacrifice captives like the Aztecs were known to do the truth is no one really knows. I think it's silly to be up an arms about this, the truth is the movie never even mentions what empire this is and it could very well be the Aztecs themselves, furthermore it is not an important detail to the story. What it shows us is that yes this is a mighty ancient empire no different than Rome or Carthage, it makes a point to shows us how this mighty empire is no longer dependent on the rain forests for its food and instead relies on domestic crops (the foundation for any civilization). The very reason these people sacrifice victims is because they believe their blood being returned to the earth will help their crops become plentiful in times of drought(sounds like a good plan to me if I was some priest trip-pin out on some mushrooms and believe me most priests were lol). It also does a great job of showing us how superior this empire must of felt itself to be when comparing itself to the small villagers still living isolated in the deep jungle. You can compare the Mayan/Aztec empire to the Romans of Western Europe they were hailed as being great engineers and thinkers and at the same time slaughtered their neighbors into capitulation and entertained their citizens to slaughterings of the captives, it is no different across the sea in the Americas. So yes the Mayan or Aztecs whatever empire you decide are represented in the movie were both great engineers and thinkers but at the same time were arrogant, brutal, and used slaughter to entertain the masses (it was like MTV back in those days). The movie has great pacing and treats your eyes to some incredible scenery be it the rain forests or the people themselves. It is comforting to not run across brad Pitt or Jennifer Connelly or some other Hollywood product in this film. Mel Gibson makes a point to show all types of humanity in this film literally the good, the bad, and the ugly. It also shows us how we are all the same regardless of race, and all of us share roots and ancestors that were once solely dependent on nature and the environment around them. Even at the end Gibson hits us with the question of what would be better returning to the forest or allowing yourself to be integrated into a civilization (yes kinda like the Tarzan tale). I have to give this movie a 10 and say it should really win an Oscar for costume and design because that is what blew me away the most. I must also stress that you won't see any cheesy over the top special effects like some people are saying, everything looked plausible and realistic to the best of its abilities. And Gibson as a director is a genius at creating dream like sequences that make the subconscious come alive he is truly a gifted director and makes a point to show the brutality of man and the good that can arise in hopeless situations.",Apocalypto
1047,CLEARDAWN,"Almost no dialog, almost no rest, yet for almost 2 hours it keeps you on your toes!",10,18 December 2006,"Often the Aztecs (bloodthirsty warriors) from central Mexico were confused with the peaceful Mayans that were highly advanced in all senses, specially in mathematics, and were located in the South of Mexico, and even as far as North of Central America. Their language, Quechua, today still in use.This said, I like to add that one thing is true about Mel Gibson-besides his negatives outbursts- he really knows how to make a movie! In Apocalypto, he proves to be at the height of Cecil B. DeMille, moving in perfect harmony a huge mass of people immersed in total hysteria.The solo runs throughout the forest, in no moment are boring, or too much of them, and I was not able to glimpse a single mistake. About the critiques I've heard of the goriness of the film, I think that since ""Apocalypse Now"", Quentin Tarantino and all the Draculas and Hannibals Lecters invented up to today, I believe we've seen it all before this movie!The script was also written by Mel in collaboration with Farhad Safina and well, it seems that the lad likes to keep himself busy!

But even 35mm couldn't have helped the cliché story told with cliché shots and cliché directing. It was like watching a dozen other films (poorly) patched into one. Great sets, great makeup, great most of everything ... except writing and directing. Why not take advantage of the mise-en-scene to create a truly unique and compelling story? Instead, the story of Apocalypto could be lifted out and placed in a thousand other contexts without altering a word (except in translation). It could have been set in Nazi Germany, the American West, 1800's Africa, or last decade's Iraq. That's not to say it resonates with archetype -- it's just to say it's incredibly ordinary. Another excuse for an endless chase scene with contrived victories over impossible obstacles.",Apocalypto
1049,dadachango69,"""El Mel"" and the Mad Maya",10,9 December 2006,"With all the anti-Semitic sentiment that Mr. Gibson has accrued for himself, it is a shame that this ""poison dart"" arrived during what could possibly be the cinematic jewel in Mel Gibson's filmographic crown. The film, ""Apocalypto"", about the journey home of a Maya warrior captured for human sacrifice, has to be one helluva serious point on the side of Latinos. The film is shot so beautifully and the action sequences are nothing short of edge-of-your-seat excitement. I applaud Mr. Gibson for two things: using Native Americans to depict this opus of Latino history, as well as keeping it in the native language (well, as close to Ancient Maya as one can get). I only got one thing to say... ""Wow."" Never in a million years would someone so close to Hollywood (AND a non-Latino, to boot) give so much furious attention to detail about a piece of OUR Americana.Just when U.S. immigration from Mexico was getting under the skin of many U.S. nationals, comes a film to bring back a bit of the glory (albeit in gory, realistic sequences) of the ancient Maya Empire. Although this film is truly epic and worthy of Oscar praise, I only wished that El Mel would have thought of showing that the Spaniards weren't exactly the ""Saviors"" of a bloodthirsty tribe of people. Yes... it is true... the Maya practiced human sacrifice and it must've been incredibly gruesome to depict graphically (this film doesn't even come close to showing those horrors), but the arriving Spainiards (at the end of the film) seemed to be a breath of fresh air amidst all the madness.Mel Gibson opened up the film by stating that no great civilization is ever conquered until it is first conquered from within. Hmmm. How does one take that? More than 60 million ancestors died under the brutality of the Spanish. Not one is shown to be at fault for the genocidal murders they committed. The ending can then be taken as one of those: ""Oh, no... here comes another bunch of people... are they friend or foe?"" If one sees it in this way, then the story all makes sense. I guess I just wish that more stories from Native Latino America showed a bit more of the resourcefulness and pride of our ancestral culture. The Maya did, after all, invent many things before Europe ever did. They even contemplated the concept of ""Zero"", not to mention influence many cultures around it, Taino Caribbean culture, as well. But, here, the Maya appear quite savage and brutal... not quite the great mathematicians we all grew up accepting (as a whole... they seemed quite surprised at the arrival of the solar eclipse... though maybe not the high priest, the one ripping out the hearts of men). At least they are shown in a respectful light from time to time throughout the film, which saves it from stereotypical hell. The costumes and the sets made it all authentic, but a question still nags at me... how is it that the Mayan civilization (within the cities) seemed to continue BEYOND the A.D. 900's, when the Classical Mayan culture had already been on the verge of total collapse... almost 6 whole centuries before the Spanish were to even arrive? By this time, almost all the Mayan cities had been abandoned. This is a salient point that never resolves itself within the film, it can't. It's like dinosaurs and cavemen walking around planet Earth at the same time. It just isn't historically-true.Not taking away from the wonder and awe created by this film, it is hard not to think how time suddenly warps by the end of this photoplay. For someone who is well-versed on Native Latino lore, this is difficult to accept.Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this film and plan to buy it for my collection. I know that this is a first for us, and maybe more accurate depictions will follow this one.",Apocalypto
1050,standOUT3688,Oh yes!! Finally a movie about Mayans.......,2,28 November 2006,"Hey, I'm a student at the University of Chicago and we had the chance of being one of the first places to have the movie pre-screened. The theater was packed for admission was free. I've always been interested in the Mayans and really looked forward to seeing this movie. I was skeptical at first on account of the director, but remembered that he was capable of directing a good movie, i.e. Braveheart, so I desperately waited for the lights to dim and the projector to roll. The film started, and WHAM- I leave the movie two and a half hours dry heaving (Not because of gore, the movie wasn't as gory as I had been expecting) and clutching my face both in disgust and disbelief. I doubt whether I have seen a worse movie in the last year let alone my life. The film starts off well until around a certain ""coincidence"" in the Mayan city, when the movie rapidly, parabolically descends into unbelievable depravity. The film ended an hour ago and I still feel nauseous. Don't get me wrong, the acting wasn't bad and the locations were incredible, the only thing that brought this movie down was the implausible screenplay, or (to be clichéd, yet totally truthful) lack thereof. The film's second half and especially its climax and ending seem to not be so much of a screenplay as the result of a poorly-done outline. I won't spoil anything for the reader, but near the end there is a scene involving a certain feminine effort which occurs under water, leaving the now- disillusioned audience to only laugh at the absurdity of it all. Thanks Mel. You've truly made a masterpiece here. *Afternote-Now that I've had a couple of days to process the movie's effect on me, I will have to say that the first half of the movie was incredible, but it's still poisoned by the second half. I would maybe even pay again just to see the first half of the movie!",Apocalypto
1051,bdub64,Favorite Movie of the Year,9,8 December 2006,"I went to the see the Early Bird showing of Apocolypto and was literally shifting in my seat as my heart raced for 2 straight hours. Visually, the movie is flawless. I had to look around the perimeter of the theater several times, just to make sure I wasn't in the jungle. The movie begins with a scene that clearly is meant to get your mind in check. You not only feel the raw Darwinism of the time period, but the bond of family and foreshadowing of ominous events. Scene after scene, I was in awe to the detail that Mel Gibson paid attention to. Costumes, Linguistics, and Story are as believable as anything I've ever seen. The thing that Gibson truly seems to get across is the fragility of life. After viewing the film, I phoned a friend and he asked how it compared to POTC. It seems to me that Gibson is obviously trying to ""wake up the masses"" with his last two films. As gruesome and gory as POTC was, Apocolypto surpasses it. A perfect film.",Apocalypto
1052,tomconmason,Blew me away,10,13 February 2012,"This is my first review on IMDb after lurking on here for years.Firstly Mel Gibson for all his faults has produced a masterpiece and this film was breathtaking. Beautiful camera work with an amazing story filled with characters you felt for.I thought he portrayed the Mayans in two lights, one who embraced sacrifice out of fear of the unknown ,i.e .. eclipses, famines and so on as a way of making things better. He also showed the Mayans as a warm, intelligent and a people at peace with themselves and there world.Loved every minute of this movie and how he did not win an Oscar is unbelievable, if a film is great is that not enough? I for one don't care about the makers personal life10/10",Apocalypto
1053,inivux,"A gut wrenching, visceral journey filled with brutality, savagery, and the bond of unconditional love",10,19 February 2012,"It took me 5/6 years to see this movie, and although I have heard good things, and although I have read the Wikipedia article on it, none of that prepared me for what I watched tonight. And to think I sort of just fell into watching it, in full, on Youtube; no reading reviews or criticism beforehand.I am glad I went into it without any preconceived notions of the imagery and the raw emotion this movie keeps throwing in your face, minute after minute.Although the ending is a positive one, there is always the nagging feeling that it WON'T end that way, due to the brutal nature of the rest of the film. The rest of the movie is wonderful too.I absolutely fell in love with the jungle society. I absolutely loathed the Mayan society (or rather, the perverse version of itself it apparently became in the end days). I absolutely fell in love with Jaguar Paw and his wife. I absolutely fell in love with the bond Jaguar Paw had with his family; that undying, unconditional love. I absolutely hated Jaguar Paw's nemesis. The antagonist Captain, eventually driven by an insane quest for vengeance, was a man that was harder to hate.This movie depicts Humanity in it's most primal state, while still portraying the people as relatively civilized enough to enable the viewer to draw connections to modern society.I don't care too much for 1:1 historical accuracy (I find it rather dull), but I also despise Hollywood's idea of ""history"". In my opinion, this was a perfect balance of ""history for the masses"" and historical accuracy.If you can handle (and appreciate) raw brutality, raw emotion, and raw savagery, watch this movie--you will not be disappointed.",Apocalypto
1054,NRVS,Mel... you're an idiot,4,7 February 2007,"Some pointers for Mel Gibson (CONTAINS SPOILERS):At some point you'll have to learn how to tell a story other than the tired 'devoted family man with a dangerous streak rises against the dark forces who have murdered a member of his family for vaguely political reasons' one. Sure, you made it work in '95, but now it just makes you look like you've run out of ideas.If you spend half an hour setting up your lead characters; getting the audience to invest in them, it is vital that you use these characters to tell a story. A real story. You know, with a plot and everything. You remember what a plot is don't you? A plot is not a collection of vignettes in which random acts of brutality and misfortune are inflicted upon your characters. Violence for the sake of it is just a cheap way to elicit controversy. Sure, you made it work in '04 but now it just makes you look desperate for attention.Continued salvation from unavoidable death by events beyond his control (incidental booby traps, continental discoveries and eclipses) makes the hero look like a sissy. And no one who paid money to watch a Mayan action movie likes a sissy.After the thirtieth scene where a lead character experiences a 'moment' while staring into the eyes of some unfortunate extra, the audience may begin to suspect that you are incapable of constructing an legitimate and original moment of emotional gravitas. It also doesn't help with the whole 'sissy' thing. Europeans are easily differentiated from people of Mayan descent. Even if they are covered in white dust. Please, Mel, don't insult your audience's intelligence. Pay attention to your casting  even the extras.I understand that two decades of studio execs blowing gold dust up your ass may have compromised your grasp on reality, so here is a short list of certainties which you may want to write down for future reference: After being impaled, the human abdomen and the organs it contains will not continue to function, even after the offending shaft is removed. It leaves holes from which important fluids are leaked. Running away from a panther also tends to speed up leakage and subsequent loss of consciousness. Giving birth to a healthy baby is difficult. A woman will struggle to do so while standing on a rock while water is rising over hear head and her young son is clinging to her face while balancing on her shoulders. The moon doesn't know that it's causing a solar eclipse on earth. It is a big rock that is oblivious to how it's interaction with other solar bodies affects humans. It will not pause for a while to contemplate the significance of the moment as it lines up with the sun.If you haven't seen the movie yet, please make an effort. It's remarkably satisfying seeing a talentless egotist make a fool of himself.",Apocalypto

It is an amazing film, but very disturbing and haunting...as it was meant to be. You can't make a film about the topic of human sacrifice and the fall of a civilization without being disturbing and haunting. The graphic violence was way too much for me and I watched most of the movie through my eyelashes. . . The directing, acting, cinematography, and writing are all amazing. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite actors, even though most of them died. The special effects were just, I keep wanting to say ""amazing""... the scenes of the city and the giant altar were so realistic. And all the types of characters in the city were interesting. The little prophetic girl is an exceptional actress!. . . .Even though it was all in subtitles it was like I was hearing it in English, I think because the movie is so intense. I probably won't buy the DVD (I am more a comedy, Pixar, lighthearted kind of movie goer) I only rated it an 8 because I thought some of the graphic violence scenes were not necessary...I can't say which ones or it would be telling too much about the film...so I guess that is all I can say except that I will be pondering this film and it's message for a long time.",Apocalypto
1057,jfd55,Gibson shall study BEFORE saying anything,1,10 November 2007,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good action movie but FAR from a historic tale. The ""Mayans"" don't look like real Mayans which modify their noses and eyes to what they believe was beautiful. The Spaniards arriving anyplace near the Mayans??? Come on! They didn't see Mayans until many, MANY years later. What about the GREAT Mayan cities? A pyramid and couple low-rise buildings are not near of what a real Mayan city was. A real Mayan sacrifice was performed in a ""chaacmol"" a laying human structure with a base on the belly and not in a flat stone. If this movie was called ""an old adventure"" or anything and if the director would never made any reference of a cultural society, this could be an entertaining film, but he chose to mention the Mayans... good for you Mel! now, go back to school or at least buy a real book about Mayans.",Apocalypto

Super white teeth weren't around when most movies were made and it ruins most movies! Now that's truly lazy! And I think people would have been more freaked out by a total eclipse!

After the interesting ending, I was really not able to do anything else, but sit back and think about it for the next hour.

1060,ac_dark_lord,Neither an Odyssey nor an Iliad: Why Apocalypto fails to be an Epic,4,13 December 2006,"I would like to preface my review with the warning that there does contain references to scenes and content within the film that some may regard as spoilers:Some herald this film as genius, as a movie that could only be made through the means of Star Power, that only someone like Mel Gibson could have made this movie. I agree, but perhaps not in the same glorious light as others. There are a number of flaws in all stages of production that really hurt this film, all the way from the writing to the marketing.First of all, without giving away the plot, there are numerous scenes that confuse me when trying to decide in the overall premise of the movie. The opening establishes this tribal village and the key characters  as any film should, in order to set up the stakes and for the audience to empathize with the characters. However, there are scenes that try and make us feel as though these people are just like us  they go to get food, they get teased by their peers, and they even have to deal with issues of infertility. This seems to slightly take one out of the fact that halfway through the film we are being told of a prophecy by a little diseased girl  and then we are then watching this man fight against nature and time. Basically, I don't know what I'm watching. I understand the plot points, but I struggle to find the theme. To be clear, it certainly is no Unforgiven (1992)  it's not breaking the conventions of fantasy, it just doesn't know what genre it wants to be. It's not intelligent or avant-garde in that sense. I think the filmmakers made a mistake, but I also think that this problem has a lot to do with the marketing. The trailer for this film promotes it as an epic, but that is not what the audience is given. Instead the film tries to be part domestic, part adventure, part religious, part thriller, and fails to succeed or pursue any of these exclusively or holistically. The film doesn't make these shifts in overall focus to teach us something as in a highly stylized film like Blue Velvet (1986), it just seems to be slightly lost without direction.Past halfway through the film we are finally given our first real motivation for what the character(s) are doing. Once it goes into a chase/race against time, the audience finally has something more tangible to latch onto other than the obscene amounts of gore (for which this movie has plenty of). I'm not sure either that this film benefited from being subtitled. In Gibson's movie The Passion of the Christ (2004), the language seems to truly add to the sense of historical accuracy and truth. However in this film, there are no differences in dialect or language between groups of people, and it seems that it really wouldn't matter what language the film was in. That is to say, they don't give any importance to the use of the language either in the context of the story, or through any of the implied messages. The use of white Europeans was equally pointless. They are randomly introduced to the film without any real purpose  at best they give us a sense of time, but they certainly don't add any weight to the story, theme, or plot motion. Speaking of motion, there is a lot of running in the forest. Be prepared to watch a lot of running. Luckily sometimes the monotony is broken up with a river or really big tree  our only true sense of the scope or layout of this jungle other than the wide shots.I think if this film had focused on being a ""coming of age"" tale, it would have been a lot more focused. This film tries to say too much without saying anything. The writers don't really utilize the fact that they are dealing with a very interesting civilization  we just hear that they believe in human sacrifice, which is the same kind of information we could get from a Discovery Channel episode. I don't feel like I understand a new point of view or have received a better understanding of the human condition or of diversity in humanity like I did from a movie like Smoke Signals (1998), or even a video game like Prey (2006).I am sure that many people will disagree with what I feel are shortcomings. However, despite what this film has going for it, such as amazing actors, beautiful cinematography, and a compelling setting, it fails to live up to what one would expect from an epic that really teaches you something, and it fails to live up to the hype surrounding Gibson's other work. When the dust settles, I think that Apocalypto is going to die with the civilization it poorly depicts.",Apocalypto
1061,matt_wiebe_1980,forget the bad Mel press and see this movie,10,12 December 2006,"It's really to bad that Mel Gibson's name got so tarnished so soon before his new movie came out. It saddens me to think that so many people are gonna write off this movie because a guy had one ruff night. Anyways, that being said, i saw this movie last night with my wife. We both LOVED it. I honestly couldn't find one thing to complain about in the whole movie. Yes, it's 2 and half hours, but it is so fast past that i didn't even notice it was that long. I've read people complain how the chase couldn't been cut in half, but NO WAY. The whole movie was so intense, and so beautifully shot and directed. Great acting, AMAZING costume design. One of the best action movies i've seen in a long time. Yes, it was gory, but it could have been worse, most of the time, the camera cuts away, or cuts to a very far away angle for the actual 'gory' part.

I've got to admit the film was a 8/10 but there is always a negative point out in every film, whether if it lacks quality in performance, or the film contents and graphics itself. The only thing what I find as a let down in the film, is the fact that the film did not speak English, which corresponds to why I gave it an 8, as the overall rating.

The movie pleased me greatly, almost as much as Braveheart. The story was well written with some well placed humor. As historically inaccurate as some people say this may be, it seemed to me, the lay person, to be a fairly accurate representation of the Mayan culture based on my semi limited knowledge of it. The movie was shot beautifully and showed the vastness of the jungle. The battle/fight scenes were also shot very well and showed just the right amount of restraint. It's rare in this day and age to see a movie with no or very little CGI and I thought that was very tasteful on Mel's part to keep this film very raw and basic. If anything, the film could actually stand to gain a little time in the narrative. Not that I'm complaining about the movie being a tick around two hours, but I think an extra 20 or 30 minutes could've helped. I think fans of Braveheart, if you can get past the language barrier, will find this to be a very satisfying film.8 out of 10.Cory.",Apocalypto

Then Jaguar Paw hides his wife and son in a dried-up well before he is taken captive.In the second half of this film, He and his friends are sent to an ancient Mayan city, where a harrowing end awaits him.

Mel Gibson did an amazing job. Everything looks natural. I feel like I was there during that time and I think that's how director Gibson made it work, just following Jaguar Paw steps during the Mayan epoch; like a reality show... I love it It's not like the other movies where actors do their best to fit the character.

1076,jsanford-3,Don't Miss One of Mel's Main Points,10,10 December 2006,"I'm stunned at how so few people have caught on to one of Mel Gibson's main points in Apocalypto. Mel Gibson is a champion of Catholicism and the advancement of Christianity. This is a film about the horrors of the Mesoamerican world and how the arrival of Europeans and the Christian faith that motivated them ultimately put an end to that paganistic hell on earth. This is Mel's counter argument to cultural relativist, humanists, anthropologist and archaeologist who put forward the view that Mesoamerica was a great advanced civilization who's culture was wantonly destroyed by the greed and evil of the conquistadors and priest that followed them.From the very first frame of the movie the quote ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within"" - Durant, appears and tells the audience what Mel believes! The Maya destroyed themselves, not the Europeans and Christianity. Following the logic of the quote, if the Maya civilization was a just, good and compassionate society it would never have been conquered by the conquistadors.The little girl with smallpox delivers the prophecy of destruction to the Mayan's corrupt, evil world when a messianic figure appears.. which is Jaguar Paw. Jaguar Paw is almost sacrificed to alter of a false God. This is a parallel to the arrival of Jesus and his sacrifice which signaled the beginning of the end for the Roman Empire and it's corrupt pagan society.The Christian cross is clearly visible at the bow of the row boats coming ashore at the end of the film. The CATHOLIC Spaniards are coming in the name of God and motivated (in part at least) to expand God's grace and kingdom on earth.Why does Jaguar Paw's wife ask whether they should go to the strange new men on the ship? And why does Jaguar answer the way he does? Jaguar Paw did not say yes because that wouldn't have been believable (and blatantly exposed Mel's message). Any Mesoamerican seeing a European ship for the first time would probably have run away in terror. But Jaguar Paw doesn't say no either. To say no would suggest they are turning away from God and salvation. Instead Jaguar Paw tells his wife they should return to the forest and rebuild their lives... Christianity and its promised salvation will catch up with them later.While everyone is praising this movie for it's cinematography and action, Mel has slipped in a big ole message....march on Christian soldier! People will understand your work for what it is someday.",Apocalypto

1078,davidtepper,rehash of a better film,6,22 December 2006,"Apocalypto is a reworking of a superior film, ""Naked Prey"" made in 1966. On the whole this was one long cliché: peaceful villagers attacked by violent tribe (see Quest for Fire), villagers marched off to slavery (see Spartacus), hero escapes to avenge his tribe (see countless others). Throw in ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and you can see Mel's inspiration. The photography was excellent, the violence not as bad as anticipated, and the acting generally OK. The final showdown was anticlimactic since it didn't really involve the most interesting character, (the sadistic one whose name escapes me). It was too long by half and needs some serious editing, particularly in the interminable jungle chase scenes. Use of what I suppose is the Mayan language was interesting. All in all a mediocrity at best and a fair adventure at worst. There is a much better movie in here, but I am afraid Mel just isn't the guy to do it. 6 out of 10",Apocalypto

That's about it.On the bad side there is plenty. The plot could have been written on the back of a postage stamp. And what plot there was, was so clichéd and obvious - it doesn't take long to work out what is going to happen and surprise, surprise it does, and to use not one but two deus ex machina events is plain laziness. But aside from the poor plot this film is awash with gratuitous, unnecessary violence. Whereas directors such as Cronenberg, Kubrick or Lynch use sporadic but intense violence for great dramatic effect, Gibson just gives us cut throat after cut throat, heart being ripped out after heart being ripped out and it frankly becomes boring and stupid.In fact stupid is a good word for this film. The film offers nothing - it doesn't try to understand or dissect Mayan culture and neither does it offer a commentary on the modern world.It is long, boring and totally pointless.",Apocalypto

Apocalypto reminded me in some ways of a movie I saw once that happened in Greenland, except there the surroundings were white and here they were mostly green.The acting was the most believable I've ever seen, I'm not kidding! I just want to recommend this film, it's difficult to say more because I just want to gush out compliments. I think there was a message as well in there, contained in the artistry and strong feeling of the story, but my favorite part was still the scary exciting stuff. I also think this movie has to be watched with your full attention, so go see it in a cinema, don't wait for the DVD unless you have to.Apocalypto is a work of art (as all movies should be) it is a real ""big"" movie as well, I was reminded of Ben Hur, even though I have never seen ""Ben Hur"".

After a few days I decided to give this movie a second chance and I must say I did not regret it at all. In the beginning the language bothered me a little but in the process of the storyline I totally forgot it.

I'd had my eye on it, read all the reviews - a weakness* - now having seen it, I'm frankly baffled by the faint praise that many have seen fit to heap upon it. It was expertly realised, entirely convincing, passionate, intelligent. One common carp is that it is somehow shallow. I entirely disagree. I think they'd really done their research, and the story was consistent with the mythology of the time and mythologising of battle and survival in general. I liked it that luck played a part in Jaguar Paw's endeavours. That's what a lot of the great stories are based on, why they came about, as it were. And the idea of the ""natural man"" versus ""corrupt city man"" is as timeless as it gets. The civilised world may not commit ritual human sacrifice, but it is hypnotised by spectacle. Anyhow, enough waffling. This is more than anything else a superb example of balls-to-the-wall film-making that we rarely see nowadays, or ever, come to think of it.

Depicts a realistic looking tribal community and ensuing battles. There is plenty of gore which seems appropriate. I would not recommend allowing a child to see this due to the very graphic mutilations / killings. Its primarily about one man's adventures and his concern over his wife and child. The Mayan city was pretty cool, not quite how I'd have envisioned it, much larger. There is brief nudity throughout which is appropriate to the time.

At the same time, though, the intense atmosphere of the movie is kept very alive by Mel's skillful storytelling. Visually, this film more than satisfies. The jungle environment is extremely rich and is the perfect setting for this pre-Columbian era film.

People who have not played the game go see it with an open mind and not look at it as a video game movie because even without the game it could stand on its own as a great movie.

1088,zeality,"Was Gibson portraying a civilization's fall, or something else?",7,8 December 2006,"SPOILERS I'm still not sure what to think. Mel Gibson tried to portray the qualities of a civilization near its death -- an ignorant population swayed by superstition and debauchery, the absence of human rights, a descent without care, or perhaps foolhardiness -- I can't pin it. But the theme is simple. The Mayan center of power has started pillaging and destroyings outlying villages for human sacrifices. Jaguar Paw manages to escape, but there on the beach are the Spanish. I think the intended interesting part is that Jaguar Paw rejects the Spanish as well, preferring to risk his life in the jungle once more and try to find a new beginning. I think the rejection of the Spanish implies that Jaguar Paw (albeit never having a love for it) has developed a distaste for central civilization and its merciless whims. One of the boats coming to the beach even has a prominent cross and friar on board. And anyway, Jaguar Paw was right on that point in particular, since we all know what the Spanish ended up doing. But what perplexes me is that Mel Gibson is the one behind this film. Its message is decidedly anti-establishment and anti-religion. Either he wasn't aware of what he was doing, or Gibson has a secret.At any rate, yes, the film is violent. But I never felt queasy, so the violence was at least in taste (though I couldn't enjoy my candy that much). A lot of the critics are rejecting the movie by virtue of the violence alone, which amuses me. There are much darker films with less horrific but more well-presented violence which could be rejected on that point, since they do masterfully cause nausea, fear, that sort of thing. But the violence of the Maya is not new -- we all know about Mesoamerican sacrifices, and to see all this blood happening on screen isn't that much of a shock. I was surprised to see breasts, since I had guessed that this would be a trademark example of how society has little restriction on violence but total restriction on the sexual side of things. But they were there. Nothing prominently sexual, though.Half the reason I saw the film was to observe their vision of a Mayan city in its full, painted glory. This is somewhat delivered; the central tower of sacrifice is hugely impressive. But I'll tell you this -- the Mayans had nothing on Rome.In summary, this is a curious film. The storytelling is visceral and illustrative, but the theme is almost too subtle -- maybe because the anti theme was not what Mel Gibson was trying to present, as he stated that it was about the fall of civilizations. But if we take the protagonist's point of view, he seems to disapprove of organized religion and civilization entirely at the end of the day. I think if Gibson had wanted to really talk about the fall, the film would have taken place purely in the Mayan city, and would have shown its rot perhaps through the eyes of a courtesan or politico. But it all occurs through the eyes of a jungle hunter, and it is with his perspective that we are left. If there is an aftertaste, it is a thankful feeling for this civilization. It is an appreciation that we're beginning to install a rudimentary safety net under humanity (should something fall). But there is a long way to go, as one can easily understand from drawing parallels with the fallen civilizations of days past.",Apocalypto
1089,houston20_nyk,"nothing special, quite disappointing",6,10 December 2006,"Having just seen this movie, the trailer made the movie much more mysterious and exciting looking than it actually was. Is it just me, or was the movie rather simplistic and dull? The whole chase through the forest in order to kill Jaguar Paw was just ludicrous. I mean the Mayans would just have let him go, he was not worth it especially after the number of lives he had cost them. Why not just let him go, i mean you already killed his entire village. Even though he killed that leader's son, I don't think the group would have continued after the numerous bad omens they encountered.The end was very typical and expected. I mean they gave hints of small pox earlier in the movie and it looks like Mel has some problems not only with the Jews but with the Christian Europeans that came over and exterminated the natives of the Americas. Was there a point of having such a gigantic cross on that small rowboat as well? I mean does Mel Gibson just hate everyone or what? The cross seemed kind of unnecessary.",Apocalypto

1091,fshasanya,A Window Into the Past...,10,9 October 2007,"This excellent movie makes a good case for film fans adhering to a simple rule when dealing with Hollywood's output - try and avoid within reason the machinations of the film industry's hype/pr/press machine or try and see and movie well after the release date. What is up on screen during the film's runtime is so poignantly removed from the modern-day world, despite the somewhat post-modern take on the translation of the Mayan tongue so sonorously spoken.In the same way some nationalities are born in a country and never leave its shores (and not just Americans!) the Mayans of the village depicted has probably never strayed beyond the areas traveled by the hunting party shown at the start of the movie. This is why they would have had little knowledge of happenings mere kilometres from their home concerning neighbouring tribes or even the mayhem at the temple. Survival was paramount and that is seen so clearly on the face of Jaguar Paw,his grim determination aided in turn by a noble death, a portentous dream, and a mystical solar event. These events and the ensuing pursuit evince pure screen magic, and with dynamic and heartfelt acting turns, the director and his crew and cast perform nothing less than alchemy in producing a tale for the ages.I don't like to rate movies with a 10 and rarely vote, but when a genuinely original, blood-soaked yet lyrical film like this comes along...

With emphasis on REALISTIC, HISTORIC and fantastically filmed NATURE scenes. Nothing bad to say about that...But actually this movie in my view also contains a very sophisticated and subtle critique of modern industrialized societies and the fact that we don't try hard enough to live in harmony with nature. Everyday we see pollution, extinct species and so forth, because humans take up more and more Space on earth and have an insatiable hunger for more and more luxuries, abilities, knowledge... It never ends. Something to think about. People dealing with FEAR might also get some useful inspiration from this movie, since the main characters becomes challenged by this and are forced to deal with it.Btw, I love the way Mel Gibson goes all the way in his directions like this and e.g. ""The Passion of Christ"".

While there is a lot of blurring of architectural periods/styles, the recreation of the main city is superbly realised and instantly credible. The eclipse/full moon is also an obvious error, but not really distracting.However, the way that Gibson engages us with these characters is superb and the two hours just flies by. As often commented, the violence is nothing like as bad as critics have suggested and is mainly off-screen and implied, and no more than is necessary for the subject matter.The handling of the climax is beautifully underplayed and fits in perfectly in the context of the movie.Let's hope it wins a shedload of Oscars (though I doubt it will!).",Apocalypto

Stay away from this movie unless you feel like being slapped in the face.Another thing - it must be difficult these days to find appropriate casting; there is a scene in the city where some of the ""Mayans"" are clearly of Eastern Asian descent. These things aside, the cinematography is pretty. That was the only thing I felt was worthwhile.

The heart of this film revolves around the importance of family. As the viewer witnesses the terrible majesty of blood-stained Aztec altars (I'm no expert but I interpreted the city to represent Aztec civilization which historically dominated and exploited the remaining Mayan tribes.) we know that this is a civilization that is doomed to fail. When the Spanish arrive, we know that their conquest of the New World is destined to be short lived (historically speaking) as well. The only constant is the bond that unites a human family - the constant that has survived and transcended every civilization that has ever existed. Gibson captures this truth perfectly.The film also works as an action film and will please many viewers who appreciate that genre. However, to categorize this film as an exercise in testosterone laden excess or to dismiss it as ridiculously gratuitous violence is to miss the point that Gibson so beautifully captures. All civilizations fail, often as result of violence or environmental degradation (a major sub-theme of this film), but the will to survive and the bond of familial love allow humanity to continue despite the rise and fall of civilizations.",Apocalypto

It was a great way to feel as though you were actually in those times, except that isn't the case at all. I was a lot younger when I first watched it, so at the time it didn't capture my attention as much as it did years later when I watched it again because I wanted to relive a good memory. I initially thought that it was a story that revolved around the Aztec civilization based on the portrayal of the sacrifices they would make to honor their gods. I later found out that it was actually a story about the Mayan civilization. That's when I started doing some research on the actual facts behind it and discovered that there were a lot of mistakes within the film. People will argue that it's just for entertainment purposes and it could all be easily overlooked. These people don't see any harm done from it, but these people probably aren't direct descendants and might not know too much about the civilization themselves. This puts the idea in people's heads that the Mayans were cruel, bloodthirsty people when in reality they weren't, at least not to this extent. This is an inaccurate representation of a civilization that was actually quite advanced and it just gives a bad reputation to them. This might not affect the common viewer, but there are people who have spent years of research just to have everyone misinformed by a film, not to mention the effect it has on the people who are actually of this culture. I will not go into details on what the inaccuracies were because you guys have access to the same information I've stumbled upon.

I get the genius of a Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Kubrick, Tarantino, Leone, Eastwood, Scorsese, etc. There is just zero doubt in my mind that this film puts Mel Gibson in that company.
Visually almost without peer. The depth and breadth of the costume design was stunning and a wonder to behold. The acting was in a word, flawless.The comedic parts were funny, the thrilling parts had me on the edge of my seat, the brutality caught me off guard at first and I'm certainly old enough to have be plenty desensitized by violent films being in my fifties. That speaks to the performances, attention to detail, and reiterates what we think we know about that culture in that era. Of course there was literary license, most films would be unwatchable without it.I couldn't write a more profound review that a couple of the other reviewers on here they've certainly captured the pure essence of the movie. I'm doubtful that I will watch it again, that said, it was a cinematic experience that I cannot compare to anything else I've seen. If you are a lover of film, everything from great narrative, production values, costume design, performances, and being emotionally drawn in to a world that you never understood, then set aside the time to add this great film to your repertoire of film experiences. Unlike most forgettable action flicks that are forgotten almost as quickly as they are seen, this very underrated film will stay with you for a long time.I'm thankful to a Maverick that I admire for having the courage to make this picture, and the vision and sheer determination do it right.",Apocalypto
1109,TheIronMonkey,"Apocalypto, a festering pile of bias.",2,11 July 2007,"This movie was mildly terrible. I guess it could be because I'm not a Mel Gibson kinda guy, but I found this to be just another example of American bias. I really have no clue, but it doesn't seem like he really read into his sources before writing the script. Yes, I'm sure the Mayans performed cardioextractions, however the whole movie was basically one huge exaggeration of the ""savage"" lifestyle the Mayans led. After Passion of the Christ I had no idea Mel Gibson could do anything but religious commentary and this movie doesn't seem to disprove that. The dialogue was terrible in my opinion, and I thought that Mel Gibson was above jokes about testicles; though I appreciate him trying, even if it was just for one scene, to humanize the Mayans, where everywhere else he simply did the opposite. That's about it really. I'd discourage watching of this movie unless you want to take a step back from it and take a good look at Gibson's bias and disparaging beliefs. Cheers, go watch some Freaks and Geeks instead.",Apocalypto

I'm in shock!!,10,2 January 2007,"Hello Yesterday (I mean the 1st of January) I had a terrible ""new year"" hangover :) However my girlfriend wanted to go to the cinema :) I agreed. The movie we picked up was Apocalypto. What can I say... during the movie I totally forgot about my hangover. Suddenly everything around me doesn't matter, because the movie payed totally my attention. The climate of the jungle was fascinating. It has to be watched on big screen in the cinema. Also the ancient city makes a great effect. There is no doubt that Mel Gibson did very well. He was a good actor, but I think he's amazing director!! I can recommend this movie to everyone, and i put my head on the line... You will enjoy it!!!",Apocalypto
1111,jackoaj,Supreme! Stunning!,10,24 April 2021,"The direction, music, make up costumes, acting, scenery is all out of this world. I truly did not feel as though I was watching a film, it was like a very real éxperience. You can feel the breaths and the chests rising in panic, fury, fear and pride. Only Dead Man Walking has ever scored a 10/10 from me. This is the other. Even the child actors were faultless. True terror on their faces, not one weak acting moment in the whole film. I could just go on. So highly recommended!",Apocalypto
1112,Dunder_Klumpet,A masterful film from a disturbed director.,10,2 December 2006,"Mel Gibson obviously has some major demons but maybe that is what makes him such a masterful storyteller.Apocalypto is his latest and IMO his greatest film, this film plays out like the bastard freak brother of the Fugitive, it is wildly entertaining and violently sick, it also is an allegory of todays society.The images in this film are breathtaking, shot with the genesis digital cameras this is the best looking digital film out to date, the cinematography is superb, the costumes,make up and art direction are top notch.The acting is a real surprise since Gibson casted actors with no experience at all, yet they are convincing.What Mel Gibson has directed here is like an ultra violent yet very entertaining action/adventure chase film, the best one in years, this is a must see, and for people worrying about subtitles, do not worry, they are simple and brisk.I give this film my highest mark, its one of the best films of 2006.",Apocalypto

Something is wrong with these reviews. Obviously the ones that hate it have been a bit hypocritical. There is too much violence? What about the world we live in today - pedophiles, serial killers, religious fanatics...do you think their ""rituals"" are better than the ancient ones? What makes us more civilized than the Mayans? Not so long ago public executions(the guillotine, public hanging) used to be mass entertainment in societies that pretend to be more civilized than the Mayans. Don't you think that we should know the truth as it is and never forget what happened and eventually learn from our mistakes? I think we have not moved a bit from where we were 2000 years ago. It is only human nature. How todays society decides which violence is acceptable(raping women during a war happens even today) and supports this violence, but when in a movie everybody thinks it's too much?",Apocalypto
1114,danny-p-weber,Very disappointing,3,29 January 2007,"I was, as were many others, massively disappointed when I watched this movie.I quite liked Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" - especially for its cinematography and excellent directing. It is hard to believe that ""Apocalypto"" was made by the same man. The cinematography is frankly worthless, a lot of the acting is questionable (though there are a few excellent performances), and the ending seems to hint at a message which is not only offensive but poorly explored.However, my biggest problem with this movie is its plot. The story could have been told in 90 minutes (as opposed to 130), and becomes increasingly ludicrous as the film progresses. There are many completely unnecessary scenes and absurdly gratuitous gore. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is also very graphic, but the violence is warranted - in fact, central - whereas in this film it is pointless and somewhat forced.Perhaps there is more to read into it, but to me it seems that Mr. Gibson is simply trying to repeat the commercial success of ""The Passion of the Christ"" with another epic, gory movie spoken in a dead language.",Apocalypto
1115,tyruk_14,"Basically this film is just Gibson's latest science project, but he takes first prize.",8,13 January 2007,"When you have a movie star of Gibson's calibre going into directing without taking on a starring role you have to wonder what he is doing but I'm thankful for him.In a time where there are Hollywood films reviving TV shows and enough remakes to fill a video store such originality is to be commended. Apocolypto is at heart a chase movie with a good purpose, a man who wants to get back to save his family.The way the tribal people are played by the cast of unknowns is done extremely well. The lead ""Jaguar's Paw"" does well to convince us he is a man on the edge with a lot to lose.Good Movie, watch it.",Apocalypto
1116,isabella-mares,Gibson continues to disappoint,1,1 February 2007,"As if slandering religions were not enough, now Gibson pretends to slander one of the most advanced, ancient, millenarian civilizations ever to exist.This film has created a great expectancy worldwide. It's a good film from a cinematographic point of view, a blockbuster hit, nothing new: CGI, chase scenes, murder, and a main character who possesses divine powers, destined to save the world, all Hollywood archetypes.For Hollywood producers to make a movie about a great national culture should have been a wonderful idea and opportunity to show and acknowledge the great and varied cultural wealth that Mexico has to offer. It's a shame that so much money was invested in a film that, instead of enhancing the great contributions of the Mayan culture, it is nothing more than an American-modeled thriller.There were so many ways to portray a story about the Mayans: their way of life, their mathematical skills (they invented the concept of zero, no less!), their harmony with nature, advanced astronomics (their ability to predict astronomical events like eclipses and equinoxes), their calendar (based on the earth's rotation and on the moon), their 2012 prophecy, or their sudden disappearance.The movie does not have, at any point, the objective to show the Mayan culture, it is all pre-packaged marketing fodder for a successful film, but for us Mexicans, it is nothing but another way in which America's Hollywood deforms the historic reality of cultures.Throughout the movie, the Mayans are portrayed as a savage, blood-thirsty people, murdering for pleasure. It is one of the great deformities Gibson makes, as sacrifice to the Mayans was a matter of courage and honor.The most disturbing part of it for me is that at this moment, Apocalypto is showing in thousands of theaters around the world, wrongfully depicting this beautiful culture. I feel Mel Gibson has really crossed a line by drastically altering history purely for financial gain.",Apocalypto
1117,maximalvelocity,Tragedy called a MAN!,10,13 January 2007,"At the moment, this movie is very underrated. Gibson succeeded to capture one of countless moments in human history that reveals nothing but collective guilt of humankind. The fall of one civilization happens long before it meets the enemies. The movie is extremely well directed. Action scenes are there not just to be there but to show what the time had to offer. The tempo of the movie leaves you breathless. The strangest of all feelings is when you think about what your ancestors were doing on another continent, while this was actually happening. To say anything else would just ruin the experience. In the end, this movie is definitely worth watching.",Apocalypto
1118,untamed-3,One of the best movies ever...,10,8 December 2006,"This movie exhibits excellence in all dimensions - story telling, direction, drama, action. It sets new standard for movies in the genre. I would say if you are watching one movie this December - this should be it. The story has a number of messages hidden in the story and for you what you take from it. I understand it underlies the theme of self realization, humanity, and pure love. It also surprisingly has parallels to the modern history where lives are destroyed for the thirst of money. I feel Mel Gibson is a master story-teller many notches above where I thought he was. This is definitely his best work. I would like to watch this movie again and am sure will enjoy it as much.",Apocalypto
1119,gewp,The Passion of the Brave-hearted Mayan,3,16 December 2006,"I saw this film, sorry, video, last week and I was very disappointed. I am a fan of Mel Gibson's movies, but we've seen all of this before. It's a chase/revenge movie that just happens to take place at the end of the Mayan Empire. Gibson even recycled scenes from Braveheart. In Braveheart, Wallace's wife is assaulted by the English and has her throat cut. In Apocolypto Jaguar Paw's father has his throat cut and another character has his wife raped and murdered. Nothing new. Oh yes and then there is the cheesy sex jokes. One of the characters is not able to get his wife pregnant so Jaguar Paw and the others ridicule him. JP's father even gives the bullied character a special plant that is supposed to help with conception, instead, it burns his genitals and his wife's mouth. Then we have the excessive amount of violence. This is not the most violent film ever made, and neither was the Passion of the Christ, but the violence in this film feels over done. It is violent for the sake of being violent.Now to the format this was shot on. Gibson decided to shoot digital, and it was a mistake. I think he must have believed that is would give his world a gritter, more realistic feel, but it just did not work. It just looked cheap. USE FILM MEL Gibson. Leave digital for documentaries and Twenty Eight Days Later. You likely think that I hated this film. That is not the case. I am a filmmaker and I know how difficult it is to make a good movie. Other than the story and cheesy and overused themes this film is fine. The production design is top notch and the special effects are excellent. This film just lacks depth. I was expecting an epic film about the fall of the Mayan Empire, not a simple revenge movie. Oh yes, and Jaguar Paw becomes Rambo at the end which is impossible. He has the crap beaten out of him, is forced to walk for two days and does not have any food or water. Then he gets hit with an arrow and runs back to his wife, still without eating or drinking and is some how able to take out all of the enemies. There is more, but I won't ruin it for you if you really want to see it. Movies like this are important, they help us to see what we should not do with a huge budget and amazing production design. Finally, I have been reading reviews and comments about this film and many people are saying that Apocolypto is this amazingly artistic film and Mel Gibson's next blockbuster. I don't' know where they got their education, but it was not by watching good films.",Apocalypto

They need to market it was what it is - an ultra violent movie that does in fact have a story.This isn't what it's pitched as. This is a classic adventure movie, which happens to be ultra violent and set in a very, very different time and place than what we're used to.In the last half hour I went from unsure... to enjoying it, and in the last five minutes I loved it.A lot of stylistic decisions worked against what it was trying to be. Lots of the clichéd words of the cinematic language were tossed around. The slow motion shots, the dramatic glances... a lot of really clichéd stuff that threw me off. I feel like if they re-cut it, and lost 45 minutes, it could be great.",Apocalypto
1121,lawnchair,"A mindless, inaccurate romp through the fall of the Mayan Empire",3,8 December 2006,"The fall of the Mayan Empire should have been one of the best stories put to film. The fact that at times it is visually stunning (though mostly looks like a documentary for Discovery channel, with that 'too clean' and 'TV' look, lacking any steady cinemographic style), sticks to the language of the time, and is directed by, whatever his own human failings may be (and which do not affect this review whatsoever - I'm not writing an essay on anti-Semitism in modern times), a man who has done some amazing work in the past should have cemented this hope. And... well, Gibson's 'Apocalypto' is definitely one of the films I'd been most excited about seeing that ended up disappointing me the most.I thought the worst was over after De Palma ravaged the story of the Black Dahlia, insulting the entire noir genre in the process, but I was sorely mistaken. 'Apocalypto' fails on so many levels to actually tell a story. Too often it falls prey to accomadating the lowest common denominator with ridiculous violence (not over the top, for I have come to accept violence as an artistic format, and love it when it is done well - see: Ridley Scott) and juvenile humor - a man eats boar balls and then smears spices on his genitalia. By the time the film concludes, well... there never felt much point, and another door is opened that maybe should have been explored more instead of focusing on the walking, running flow that Gibson centered his movie around.This film could have been so much more -- then again, that could be said of so many films.Save your money and go and see something else.",Apocalypto

For instance- the film does not depict so many of the Mayans attributions- the calendar, their mathematical capacities and how they were so immensely ahead of their time- how about building an observatory around the years 600 BC!!! This civilization that makes so much part of what we Mexicans are today alongside the many other mesoamerican civilizations is portrayed in the most disgusting and uncelebrated way in Apocalypto- it is as if it was no more than a group of bloody savages! Yet they were not interested in killing! Their idea of sacrifice as an offering for the many mesoamerican Gods was shared by many others! And even the Spanish are shown! If Mel Gibson had any actual knowledge of the Mayan culture he would have known that the Spanish arrived in Veracruz at a time when the Mayan culture was already extinct and that they did not travel all the way to the Yucatan peninsula! Instead they traveled towards what is now Mexico City to encounter the Aztecs!!!!!! And also- when the Greeks or Romans slaughtered to appease their Gods they were not shown to be civilizations of destruction and massacre! I find it appalling that someone with as little information regarding a culture so filled with depth and knowledge decides to make a movie with a great budget that essentially doesn't even demonstrate the many, many beauties of what Mayan culture was!",Apocalypto

The film is pretty heavy on symbolism and, as various experts have informed us, plays fast and loose with historical facts. It's not the first film to have done this. but I'm happy enough to accept the odd device in movies that may stretch the belief threshold a bit so long as they're good films. Which this is. Anyhoo, my real point is this. The Mayan priest carrying out the sacrifices said the people and the land were dieing, (which was why more sacrifices were needed to appease the Gods). But was the actual reason the land was poisoned and the people dieing because they were contaminated by the piles and piles of sacrificed corpses decomposing round the back of the temple?",Apocalypto

Gibson has performed a beautiful piece in this film. The trailers looked odd, but one must realize it is difficult to make a trailer for a foreign film that uses subtitles. Many have called the film the most violent of the year. Having seen it, the violence and gore is less than films like Saw III. The difference? Apocalypto does the violence in such a way where it is so non-glorified, that even a person hanging without any bloody effects is disturbing. Yes, the human sacrifice scene is disturbing and gory...but it was done from two different angels (wide, and a pov shot). Neither view was as gory as it could have been...think, if you will, the ""ending"" of Braveheart...Rare is the film that contains cinematography and editing of this caliber.

Critics were saying that the movie was grotesquely violent, but I didn't mind it. I think that the movie is now one of my favorites and Mel Gibson did a great job of directing. I really liked how the entire movie was in their native language because it made it so much more believable and I didn't even mind having to read the subtitles. There wasn't a dull moment in the movie and I really think it should be considered for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

I learned my lesson. Don't take your kids to an Icon productions flick! While Satan makes no guest appearance in Apocalypto, the sick little orphan girl makes a chilling prophecy during the death march that plays out thru the rest of the movie.I like the entertainment value offered by the jungle chase, because there is nothing but pure energy and wilderness to be reckoned with.Let's face it, the Indians around the Pilgrims Thanksgiving table cann't hold a candle to Mel's Mayans.Most historians cann't agree what happened to Mayan civilization. Gibson captures a pretty good image of what could well have happened.Finally, Gibson should be commended for encouraging his audience to learn to read subtitles.

But, aren't we seeing it everyday on television, in the news,... or where not? Life is a battle, and family- the only true refuge for each of us after the long every-day struggle. And that's the theme of this movie for me. I see that Mel has many enemies because of what he presents in his movies, but I think that they miss the point. Or they just don't want to see the truth. Mister Gibson touches the true nature of human beings and brings it to his movies, so if I am wrong by telling that I like his movies and that I like ""Apocalypto""...

As it stands, it is up against a lot as far as audiences go. With that said, this is a FABULOUS film. I had a huge crush on Mel the actor 25 years ago with the Road Warrior movies. Fast forward and I now consider him one of the greatest directors of our time (one fighting inner demons). Not many could take subject matter from the Discovery Channel, spoken in a basically dead language, and turn it into an emotional roller-coaster ride with sprawling scenery, characters you care for and a story that will keep you talking long after you leave the multiple.

Mel's done an A1 job of recreating a forgotten world and within it weaving a tale which begins gently and then hammers your brain into submission.It's a little gory but I wouldn't say that it was entirely gratuitous. the violence is a necessary feature of what was an extremely brutal society and way of life.All credit to everyone involved in this film, it's one of the best I've seen for ages.",Apocalypto

Unfortunately, like all directors experience eventually, this film is not one of his best. Set in time of the Mayan empire, it focuses on their violent nature and fascination with death. Everyone knows that the native cultures of South and Central America were violent, however this film goes over the top to a ridiculous and distracting degree. It seemed every two minutes someone was being stabbed, maimed, or gutted. The plot was very weak, nor you could not attached yourself to any character to a great degree.

The director made a documentary about a civilization we really do not know much, and yes; there's a story that encases a lot of feelings in it. I don't think you could get bored. Actually, the Mayan language spoken in the whole movie really gives a different environment, the idea where you are about to see a movie that has a great chance to become a master piece.Sometimes you could come out of the movie theater thinking you got something extra for the ride, ""Apocalypto"" gave me that thought.

Uh, no, Mel, we actually would have liked to see a good story line.The movie ends on a confusing note as well. One of those, ""is that it?"" endings.Cinematography was not that great either.

So today I started reading the reviews and was shocked at what I read. Granted everyone has their own opinion and tastes but this movie was near flawless. Gibson is a good actor but his real talent is behind the camera. I can't help but think the bad reviews are based on what transpired last summer.

Then he gets back to his wife and saves her, and there's a happy ending, VERY unlike what really happened to the Mayas..I really can not understand why directors of this caliber still want to put movies into the standard format.

By that time, the Mayas were ethnic groups dominated by the Aztecs. Second, were there black panthers in America prior to the arrival of the Spaniards? There were jaguars and pumas, but black panthers? Not sure. Third, this is not a film about the end of the Maya civilization, this is an action movie (closer to ""Rambo"" than anything else) of a manhunt. I will not comment in the amazing amount of inconsistencies and absurdities about this film, since I will present the result of my reflection in the Native American Studies Symposium next May, and it will be available online after that date. Comnenting more now would practically tell the entire film to the readers of this note. Finally, it is an insult to any Native Latin American today (and I am proudly one): the end presents the Europeans as the the saviors of the poor man who is object of the chase. And the Indians are depicted here either as the noble savage (Jaguar Paw) or as the terrible cannibal (Mayas). Violence, cruelty, nude bodies, childish laughing at its best: that's the First World's shallow view of the Indian/Native groups of the Americas even today. This is Hollywood's imperialist vision of the Other, whoever is not part of Hollywood. This is a shallow (and insulting) way to make money out of the fears one has for that what is unknown, but closer than they think. After all, the Indians were first in today's called ""Americas"".

The cinematography was spectacular and the depiction of an ancient civilization and culture very enlightening. I was pleasantly surprised to discover a touching love story with an incredibly courageous account of a man performing super human feats to protect and save his family. In addition, the father/son relationships were quite inspirational both among the conquered tribe and the conquering warriors. The use of the ancient Mayan language added to the authenticity of the tribal life and I thoroughly enjoyed the interplay of the young men as they played mean spirited practical jokes on one of their tribal mates.

Apocalypto is one of the most breathtakingly exciting and ultra-violent movies made since Braveheart. It contains a well- structured beginning - creating a personality in the the opening tribe that creates a relationship between you and the characters - making you feel for them all throughout. The movie also includes a decent love story between the main character and his family. Amongst all this is as much blood and gore an R-rated can feature. If you can handle decapitations, hearts being pulled out of their chests, and a man's face being removed by a jaguar, then go see Apocalypto. It's as epic as movies get with enough action to compel and draw you in from the beginning to the end.",Apocalypto
1141,Droeis,"Very bad movie, but great images.",3,11 January 2007,"The only reason i've given this movie more than 1 out of 10 points, is the really good screenplay. The people responsible for these great shots must get the credit they deserve.The rest of this movie is absolutely worthless. Every character is either really good or really evil. This movie is set in some made-up ancient middle American civilization. Every single ""Maya"" shown on screen is a blood thirsty monster who kills for pleasure (the human sacrifices are used only as another display of sadistic behavior). Sounds like a good horror flick? maybe.But the idea of Mel Gibson was to make a ""historic epic in an ancient language"" ! So we must assume that REAL Maya's were bloodthirsty and savage people, ready to be ""saved"" by the Europeans (As the quote at the beginning of this movie implicates).That's not just really inaccurate, it's racism.I believe the Mayas were ahead of their time in the field of mathematics and astrology. We could actually learn a lot of them, but Mel Gibson doesn't care about science and cultural aspects in his ""historic epic"".By the way, i've read multiple comments which state that this movie wasn't even set in the correct time, because when the Spanish landed, there were no such things as lively Maya cities. I can't tell if that's true, but assumed it is, this is another Major mistake.So you'd better avoid this movie and watch a good documentary if you want a historic point of view.But for those who like killing, fighting and of course cross country running, all in HD-smoothness, this movie can be fun.",Apocalypto
1142,lazomia,Best Picture of 2006,10,12 December 2006,"Moviegoers!The Best Picture of 2006 has arrived at Theatre's across America!! This film is packed with action from start to finish. Not only do the two and a half hours cruise by, you feel like your the actual movie the entire time. Not only does this film contain 24/7 action, but the story, screenplay, and actors are all dazzling. Gibson made wonderful choices as far as casting, filming, location etc. As an avid moviegoer. I was not able to point out anything about this movie that I did not like. What wasn't there to like? Yes, you've all heard about the gore in the movie, but that's what makes this situation so real. Gibson didn't use gore for show, he used it because thats what was actually being done and what was actually happening at the time. All of his choices were accurate as director and is a clear shoe-in for an Academy Award Best Director Nomination, and possible Oscar gold by the end of the night. It is clear the film deserves multiple nominations, except for acting nominations because the film was such an ensemble piece, but I hope the Hollywood Foreign Press and/or Academy voters don't hold his July rant on the Jewish faith against him, and honor this professional with the decor he deserves!Everyone, go catch Apocalypto before it fades from theaters's and heads for the Oscar Gold!",Apocalypto
1143,detroitmalujoe-1,A beautifully shot thrill ride with much authenticity to offer!,10,8 December 2006,"First, I want to say that while I am a big fan of Mel Gibson as the director, I am not one to judge his personal life or problems and let that carry into my judging of his films. Besides who in Hollywood doesn't have some problems? Anyhow, Apocalypto was more than I expected. I was expecting it to be a whole bunch of jungle music, violence, crazy rituals, and people running. Well there was a lot of that, but therewas more. The score int eh movie is gripping, just as Mel outdid himself in The Passion. He captures the authentic emotions, native tongues, culture and aura of the ancient Mayan culture. The make-up and aesthetic touch ups int he movie were simply amazing. Many movies that attempt to immerse you into another world fall short of doing so. However Apocalypto does almost as well as Lord of The Rings in making you feel as you are really there! The cinematic angles used, the acting was superb, and the essence of Mayan culture captured by the movie was unparalleled. The idea of filming of this movie was very innovative. Besides, these days (especially in America) we are so focused on Homeland security and the War on Terror (which is a good thing) and ourselves that we fail to really acknowledge or pay homage to the races of our ancestors and the lost tribes of the world. This is a worthy movie and I do not recommend waiting for the rent, go watch it at the theater! Lastly I must warn that it is a bit violent and bloody and while it weaves into the storyline well - you may want to leave the kids at home.",Apocalypto
1144,bigbrotheredinthehouse,This movie is the best ever!!!!!,10,8 December 2006,"So Mel Gibson gets a lot of crap, but this movie is to die for! Every scene contains action! From snakes to human scrafices, each kill is amazing, and it contains no boring scenes except for maybe the beginning which contains some jungle humor and sets up the story. I can't wait for a squel with the Spanish. The movie gives you a feel for jungle life along with a lot of gore with the Aztec civilization. I highly recommend this movie, because it is exciting but totally different from anything Hollywood usually spits out. Go see this movie!!!!! The previews give you a mixed feeling. Who wants to see a normal jungle movie about Indians? But this movie will blow you out of the water. A man is chases by a pack of Aztec warriors in order to save his resue his family from almost certain death. This is a definitely must see!",Apocalypto
1145,robjames1984,A great film that shouldn't be missed,9,5 January 2007,"I have recently returned from seeing this film and I have to say that I was impressed and surprised by the quality of the picture. Having read several other reviews I prepared myself for a gratuitous gore-fest, but, like a few others, found the violence not to be as bad as I had expected - I have seen far worse and unnecessarily brutal scenes in other recent movies that did not receive a word of criticism. There are scenes that are unpleasant and uncomfortable to watch but I felt as though it was necessary in order to portray the sheer horror and struggle that man must go through in order to survive.This truly is a story of survival that grabbed my attention from start to finish. The acting, on the whole, was very good - although since I am unable to speak Mayan I suspect it makes it slightly more difficult to judge acting performance. The cinematography was fantastic, as was the costume/make-up design etc.I generally like to judge a good film by whether or not I continue to think about it for some time after its actually finished and whether my appreciation grows of it grows over time - I sense that this may be the case with this film.I think its a great film should be seen in the cinema and I hope that you find it as enthralling and riveting as I did.",Apocalypto
1146,frederfredersen,gratuitous drivel,3,11 December 2006,"I decided to give Mel a chance after showing his inner anti-Jewish self, so I plunked down full price to see Apocalypto in the theater, something I rarely do these days. After 2+ hours of viewing his ""comeback,"" I can safely say he's dug his own hole this time, not with a racist rant but with a stinky mess of a movie.Mel is at it again with gratuitous amounts of blood, gore, and suffering in this movie. In case you think I'm just anti-sad or gross things in film, keep in mind Peter Jackson's in my top five director list, but Mel manages to pack copious amounts of gratuitous violence into this film without justifying it with a coherent point. Sure, in Entertainment Weekly he says the movie is about ""fear,"" but apart from having the actors (the one redeeming quality to this film, that and the costumes) chit-chat about their fears a little bit, he fails to offer the audience something beyond this highly abstract point.I can't help but think that on some level the point of this film is to justify the European conquest of the Americas. By portraying the Aztecs as a society of murderous thieves and drug addicts, without exception, the film seems to imply that the Spaniards' near total obliteration of the Aztec people and culture was just part of ""what was coming to em."" I'm not an expert in Aztec history, so I can't conclusively say that Mel's portrayal is entirely inaccurate, but given the fact that his portrayal of the Aztecs is so flat and uniform I wonder how much about their civilization he left out for purposes of making them look like they deserved conquest.Overall, I'm very disappointed that a film like this found its way into Mel's hands. This period of history deserves to be treated with respect and great artistry, something which Mel is no longer capable of delivering, except maybe to white non-Jews like himself. I think it's sad that ancient Mayan or Aztec civilization will probably not get another chance for a long time for a filmmaker to create a great story and film inspired by it.",Apocalypto
1147,mike50401,Very Bad movie with a very shallow plot and no real value.,1,16 December 2006,"This is by far the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Mel has done some wonderful things in the past, and I was so looking forward to this. I was happy when it was finally over.There seems to be no purpose for the movie, and the plot very shallow. It is not all that entertaining, and it doesn't have a message. It is not all that accurate to what I have always learned about the Mayans.Many of the scenes were a stretch of being reasonable, and some of the humor was way off for a Gibson film. The movie started off with a big testicle eating scene that didn't do anything for me. No it doesn't bother me, but it was over done and had no purpose. That scene could have been made a lot shorter and still gotten the point across. Also graphic scenes like that (and worse) are throughout the movie. It's OK for adults, but you would not want to take kids or older kids to see it. There is a lot of blood, guts, and graphic scenes just for the sake of being graphic.For all of Mel's shortcomings in this movie, the acting was great. The cheesy and sometimes unrealistic situations were not the actor's fault. They did great with what they had to work with. Also the camera work and technical aspects were very good.",Apocalypto
