0,bkoganbing,Those old horror flicks,7,8 August 2015,"Some kids who are really into those old Universal horror flicks have this club they call The Monster Squad. But soon enough their knowledge about how to kill some of these legendary creatures comes in mighty handy in their small town.Andre Gower and Robby Kiger head the group and it's a good thing their services were needed right at this point in time. By the look of them in another year these kids would be hitting puberty full stride, one of them Ryan Lambert is already showing inclination of interest in the opposite sex.Best scene in the film is during the climax when a virgin is needed to read an incantation and when it doesn't quite work because the virgin's not quite a virgin Gower's little sister is brought in as a pinch hitter. Duncan Regehr makes a fine, menacing Dracula topping the cast performance list. Regehr plays it absolutely straight for the young audience this film was aimed at.With an original premise based on how Bud&Lou got tangled up with all their monsters in Abbott&Costello Meet Frankenstein and a climax which liberally borrowed from the Back To The Future films, The Monster Squad is still an enjoyable film for young audiences.",The Monster Squad
1,Leofwine_draca,Warm-hearted nostalgia kick for monster geeks,8,29 August 2016,"THE MONSTER SQUAD is one of those '80s nostalgia films that can happily sit in the same company as THE LOST BOYS, GHOSTBUSTERS, and THE GOONIES. Essentially, it's the story of how a band of monster-mad kids manage to defeat a band of genuine movie monsters, and with a running time that barely reaches 80 minutes there's not a great deal of time for anything else other than the set up and the pay off. On the minus side, the film is light hearted and corny throughout, full of predictable clichés involving the monsters and lacking the smallest bit of characterisation.On the plus side, it has genuine warmth, a good child cast for a change (the late Brent Chalem as Horace or 'Fat Kid' is the best), pretty decent-looking monsters and plenty of cheesy action to recommend it. Of the monsters, my favourite is the Creature from the Black Lagoon, a great guy-in-a-suit effect; Dracula has a little too much goth make-up while Tom Noonan's Frankenstein (sic) looks the part but is too much of a softy. The werewolf is the second best effect and recalls Oliver Reed in The Curse of the Werewolf.Pacing is spot-on and there are some catchy '80s tunes to enjoy, as well as plenty of references to films, Universal classics and otherwise; the bit where Frankenstein's Monster approaches the little girl by the river bank is my favourite reference and a very clever one it is too. Leonard Cimino has a perfect role as a concentration-camp survivor. The ending of the film features a vortex in time that appears to have been ""inspired"" by the one at the end of EVIL DEAD II, which coincidentally was released a few months before this movie. Some scenes are hilarious, like the unravelling of the Mummy on the back of the car. The tone of the film veers wildly from kiddie (anything with the cute little girl) to teen-style bad language and bad taste to adult (guns, the black cop getting blown to pieces in the car, the werewolf exploding in a shower of guts and limbs) but it remains entertaining throughout, and that's what counts. Director Fred Dekker clearly loves his material, and it's this love that makes this film touching.",The Monster Squad
2,SnoopyStyle,fun kids' monster movie,7,11 April 2015,"One hundred years ago, Dr. Van Helsing and his men tried to rid the world of vampires and monsters. He failed and Dracula survives. Dracula travels across the globe and drops into the unsuspecting town. Sean and Patrick are young best friends who formed the Monsters Club. Chubby Horace is picked on by E.J. and Derek but he's rescued by Rudy. Sean's little sister Phoebe keeps hanging around. Sean's father police detective Del (Stephen Macht) is called in after a mummy is stolen from the museum. At the police station, a man claiming to a werewolf is demanding to be locked up. Dracula gathers them along with Swamp Thing and Frankenstein's Monster to wreck havoc and recover a magical amulet. Sean is given Van Helsing's diary but it's written in German. They get their mysterious neighbor Scary German Guy to translate the diary.This is reminiscent of 'The Goonies'. A bunch of young kids going on an incredible adventure. That's always a great concept. This isn't terribly scary. The monsters look old-timey. However it is a lot of fun. It's got funny moments like ""Wolfman's got nards!"" and the little girl is loads of fun. The older sister should probably be brought in a little earlier. She adds a different needed energy. The other kids are all good but nobody really stands out. Overall, this is a fun monster movie for the kids.",The Monster Squad

In the present days, Dracula travels to the United States and arrives in a small town. He summons the Werewolf, the Mummy, the Swamp Thing and Frankenstein's creature to help him to retrieve the amulet.In the town, a man claims that he is the werewolf and goes to the police station to ask to be locked up in a cell. Meanwhile a mummy vanishes from the local museum and police detective Del (Stephen Macht) is assigned to investigate the case. When his son Sean (Andre Gower), who is a monster fan, learns the news, he joins his friends Patrick (Robby Kiger), Horace (Brent Chalem) and Rudy (Ryan Lambert) in his monster club to read a Van Helsing's journal that was given by his mother. However the book is written in German and they are not able to translate it. So they asks for help from their weird neighbor that they call Scary German Guy (Leonardo Cimino) and they discover that they need to recover the amulet and a virgin to get rid off Dracula and the monsters. Meanwhile Sean's little sister Phoebe (Ashley Bank), who is unsuccessfully trying to join the club, befriends Frankenstein's creature. The unlike group brings Patrick's sister (Lisa Fuller), who claims that is virgin, to read the passage that sends the monsters to the limbo. Will they be successful in their intent?""The Monster Squad"" is a highly entertaining cult movie with a funny story that entwines adventure, dark comedy and horror. This film is also a tribute to the Universal Monsters. There is a touching moment when the Scary German Guy tells to the kids that he has experience with monsters and we see a concentration camp number on his arm. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Deu a Louca nos Monstros"" (""The Monsters Have Gone Crazy"")Note: On 24 July 2016, I saw this film again.Note: On 09 Sep 2018, I saw this film again.",The Monster Squad
4,classicsoncall,"""...soon, the creatures of the night will rule the world.""",7,14 November 2016,"This film was more oriented for the younger set than I anticipated, but it does offer a cool tribute to all those iconic Universal Monsters of the Thirties, along with 1955's Creature From the Black Lagoon. This would be a nice primer to get youngsters acclimated to the idea of horror movies when they grow up, Frankenstein is kind of user friendly, and any film that demonstrates how to unravel The Mummy can't be all bad. The inclusion of all the vampire lore was a neat touch, especially when updated with that crossbow 'stake to the heart' delivery system they came up with in the early going. Duncan Regehr is probably the handsomest movie Dracula to ever come down the pike and was probably the best choice of an antagonist for the members of the monster squad to do battle with. I thought the Scary German Guy (Leonardo Cimino) offered the best example of true horror in the world with the reference to a Nazi concentration camp, but that scene blew by so quickly I don't think most viewers would catch the nuance. Certainly kids would need to have it explained to them. Overall, this was a decent family friendly 'horror' flick, generally done in good taste with some minor exceptions. Kids grow up quick enough as it is without movies being peppered with references to virginity and wolfman nards. But so it goes.Say, anyone catch that cameo by The Invisible Man?",The Monster Squad
5,gavin6942,A Classic,7,3 October 2015,"A young group of monster fanatics attempt to save their hometown from Count Dracula (Duncan Regehr) and his army of monsters.A bit of this movie has aged poorly, namely its homophobic comments. Not to say that kids don't talk like that, but it is much less likely you would see it in a movie today (2015) than in the 1980s. The whole outlook on homosexuality has shifted completely (for the better). There is also some potty language which was okay for PG movies in the 1980s but probably would not slide today.Overall, though, this is a really good movie that brings the Universal monsters to the next generation. I am not exactly sure how they were able to use the characters without risking copyright infringement, but well done. And it is great to see Jon Gries in an early role, well before his big break as Uncle Rico.",The Monster Squad
6,lee_eisenberg,"Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney would be proud.",10,6 July 2005,"The '80s brought a slew of movies about a group of kids saving the day, but in my opinion, ""The Monster Squad"" was the coolest. The plot centers on a group of horror movie-loving youngsters in LA who form a club called the Monster Squad. They have to use their knowledge acquired from the movies when they learn that Count Dracula is planning to take over the world with his army of Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman, the Mummy and the Creature from the Black Lagoon.If nothing else, we can safely assume that they probably had a lot of fun on the set of this movie. The fact that I have seen this movie puts me in that select group of people who have seen movies as different as ""La strada"", ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Monster Squad"", and believe you me, I'm proud of that status. I think that this movie, along with ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""Chopping Mall"", should be declared the trio of really neat (if campy) horror flicks from the '80s.",The Monster Squad
7,Woodyanders,A wonderfully witty and dynamic tongue-in-cheek delight,9,7 August 2007,"The evil Dracula (a suavely sinister Duncan Regehr) and his band of equally pernicious monsters -- Frankenstein's monster (a very engaging Tom Noonan), the Wolfman, the Gillman and the Mummy -- need to gain possession of an ancient powerful amulet so they can rule the world. It's up to a gaggle of misfit horror movie buff teenage boys -- likable leader Sean Crenshaw (Andre Gower), bumbling fat kid Horace (the hilarious Brent Chalem), nervous Patrick (Robby Kriger), spunky little squirt Eugene (Michael Faustino), and token cool dude Randy (Ryan Lambert) -- to stop the foul fiends before it's too late. Ably directed by Fred Dekker (who also gave us the terrific ""Night of the Creeps""), with a really clever and inspired script by Dekker and Shane Black, a constant unflagging pace, excellent make-up f/x by the ever-reliable Stan Winston, beautifully sparkling and polished cinematography by Bruce Houghton, a rousing, majestic orchestral score by Bradford May, funky 80's slang (favorite words include ""wuss,"" ""jerkoid,"" and the immortal ""nards""), some mild gore (the Wolfman gets blown in half in an especially grisly scene), and nifty 80's period touches (there's a ""Miami Vice"" dialogue reference and keep your eyes peeled for the ""Robotech"" t-shirt), this sweetly affectionate tongue-in-cheek homage to vintage golden oldie creature features has plenty of charm and energy to spare. What truly makes this film such a treat is the positively infectious sense of pure go-for-it good-natured fun that permeates every last loving frame. The kid leads all give highly appealing performances; they receive bang-up support from Stephen Macht as Sean's harried cop father Del, Mary Ellen Trainer as Sean's long-suffering mother Emily, Ashley Bank as Sean's adorable little sister Phoebe, Stan Shaw as Del's sarcastic partner Detective Sapir, Leonardo Cimino as the friendly Scary German Guy, and Jason Harvey as mean bully E.J. A total blast!",The Monster Squad
8,ma-cortes,"Youthful monster movie delivering lots of noisy action, frights and laughs",7,30 March 2020,"Pretty good comic parody, full of comedy and mosters with a lot of entertainment and amusement. To take advantage of confluence of evil that happens once every hundred years Count Dracula flies to America, then he summons his monstrous disciples. As a little community is inundated by several monsters as Dracula : Duncan Regehr, Frankenstein creature : Tom Noonan, Mummy, Wolfman and Old Fangface has also inherited the Gill Man from the somewhat more recent Creature from the Black Lagoon. All of them led by Dracula, and while they are all searching for a life-sustaining amulet that controls the balance between evil and good. Once every Century the amulet turns vulnerable to attack and this is the moment for Dracula and his hoodlums to carry out their purports. But their opponents result to be a brave squad of adolescents and sub-teens who believe in monsters but watching them on big screen. As the sympathetic teenagers are rooted in a sure and likeable grasp of the Monster Movie mythology. Then, Frankenstein creature befriends the five-year old junior girl member of the M squad and is soon converted to its cause.
An original and attractive plot in which Dracula, Frankenstein and company stir from the depths to struggle for the possession of an ancient and magic jewel , apart from a breathtaking final as tots and grits fight to the death. Furthermore, time-honoured traditons in fashion style, are not neglected, such as friendship between Frankenstein and a little girl, stakes in woodwork class, melt down their parents' cutlery to make silver bullets and give the monsters hell. Somewhat different monster film that turns to be a jokey pastiche, but still somewhat entertaining. The film has action, thrills, hilarious moments and the rest is a nice spoof hokum. This is a junior rendition of Ghost Busters and taking parts here and there of The Goonies, starred by a valiant group of pre-teens, kids and their slighly older tough guy colleague. A diverting and surprising screenplay from actor/writer/filmmaker Shane Black and director Fred Dekker himself. It provides a sympathetic cast with plenty of kiddies and adults as Andre Grover, Rubby Kiger, Ryan Lambert, Faustino Stephen Match, Stan Shaw, Mary Ellen Trainor.It contains a rousing and long-standing musical score from Bruce Broughton. As well as a brilliant and colorful cinematography by Bradford May. This clever motion picture was competently directed by Fred Dekker who returns to the tradition al Hollywood gang of monsters and he performs around imaginatively with the genre while giving several cool touches. Dekker has directed and written good terror, Sci Fi pictures, as his debut feature, Night of the Creeps, Robocop 3 and this Monster Squad. Rating 7/10. Better than average. The pic will appeal to terror, comedy, in Goonies style, enthusiasts.",The Monster Squad
9,BA_Harrison,"A silly, scary monster mash that positively reeks of 80s.",7,6 August 2008,"Featuring no-less than five classic screen horror characters (The Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, Gillman and The Mummy) plus a trio of sexy vampiresses for good measure, The Monster Squad is a great way to introduce your kids to the world of creature features.It's a silly, light-hearted, chunk of 80s fun -- kinda like the Goonies crossed with the Universal horror films of the 30s and 40s -- which shouldn't cause nightmares, but rather provide plenty of laughs and the odd thrill or two.The plot sees Dracula and his monstrous pals attempting to tip the balance between good and evil in their favour by finding and destroying a magical amulet. Standing in their way, however, are a gang of plucky kids who possess the knowledge to defeat the evil count once and for all.It may be pure popcorn cinema, and have it's fair share of plot-holes, but with Stan Winston providing the excellent make-up effects, Richard Edlund overseeing the visual effects, and obvious genre fan Fred Dekker calling the shots from the director's chair, this is highly watchable stuff. And if you remember the 80s, it's also a bit of a laugh thanks to loads of very dated and cringe-worthy fashion, haircuts and dodgy pop tunes (the Monster Squad rap at the end is abysmal!).",The Monster Squad
10,moonspinner55,"For anyone who felt one ""Goonies"" wasn't good enough...",2,4 March 2009,"Kiddie-time torture. A monster-obsessed group of yapping juveniles ends up tangling with Dracula, the Mummy, the Wolf Man, the Gill Man, and Frankenstein's Monster, who have all come to modern-day suburbia in search of a powerful amulet. Affectionate, perhaps, but unexceptional. Has gained an appreciative audience via cable TV, but not many crowds turned out for this in the theaters (nostalgia being out-of-favor in 1987). The movie's weakest link--the rather tacky-looking monsters--is the linchpin of the whole production and, unless you're in need of a ""Goonies"" retread, the kids are not much of a draw. The anachronisms in Shane Black and Fred Dekker's script may hook curious baby-boomers...for about a minute. Dekker also directed, shabbily. * from ****",The Monster Squad
11,paul_haakonsen,Iconic monster mash-up...,6,20 October 2019,"The 1987 movie ""The Monster Squad"" is one of those movies that you can watch again and again. I believe this is my third or fourth time watching it since having it on VHS back in the late 80s.Mind you, this is a movie aimed for a young audience, but the movie has enough horror elements to it to make it interesting for even an adult audience. And being a life-long horror fan, having a movie with iconic horror characters together is just a blast. I mean, you have Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the creature from the Black Lagoon, a mummy and a werewolf. So it is essentially the whole package of iconic movie monsters from the golden age of horror films.While the storyline is aimed for a younger audience, I mean you have a group of kids in a club focusing about movie monsters coming face to face with real life monsters, then it is actually entertaining and wholeheartedly enjoyable.Even today in 2019, the special effects in the movie are still holding up. Sure, this is not something that will bedazzle you or blow you visually away, but the special effects work their magic and well in favor of the movie.The acting in the movie was good, and the child actors and actresses really carried the movie phenomenally, making it very enjoyable to watch.And the monsters in the movie were just spot on, and I was and still am especially impressed with the make-up on the mummy and the sea creature. That is just amazing, especially back then.""The Monster Squad"" is a good movie for the family, especially for a Halloween movie. I am rating this 1987 cult movie a solid six out of ten stars.",The Monster Squad
12,BandSAboutMovies,Greatness!,8,7 March 2019,"The Monster Squad is a pre-teenager club of monster kids who find themselves in the midst of a battle against the very monsters they idolize. It's everything I wanted to happen in my life before - and after - puberty. It was written by Shane Black and Fred Dekker and directed by Dekker, who was also behind Night of the Creeps.The Monster Squad is Sean, Patrick, Eugene, Pete the dog and Horace, as well as Sean's sister Phoebe, who keeps trying to join. I love how their clubhouse has a poster for Fulci's Zombie!They find the diary of Van Helsing, but can't translate it from German until they finally talk to the owner of the scariest house in the neighborhood (Leonardo Cimino, who famously ended the first night of the miniseries V by spraypainting the red logo over the Visitors' poster).It turns out that there's an amulet composed of concentrated good that keeps the monsters from getting too strong. For some reason, one day out of every century, the forces of good and evil reach a balance. That's when the otherwise indestructible amulet can be destroyed. Also, by coincidence, that is in a few days and the kids are the ones who have to find the amulet and use it to send the monsters to Limbo.Van Helsing had tried this a hundred years ago, but his old enemy Dracula survived. Van Helsing's students hid the amulet in the United States, so the monster puts together his team of evil to get it back. There's the Mummy, a Gillman, three teenage girls that Dracula transforms into his brides and a reanimated Frankenstein's Monster (Tom Noonan!), all of whom he uses to get the amulet.The Monster ends up meeting up with Phoebe and becoming a good guy. Even the Wolfman isn't too into the cause, as he calls the police to try to get them to help when he's in human form.The kids eventually go one-on-one with the very monsters they've grown up loving. This movie is packed with great special effects and has grown to inspire plenty of movie lovers, the same way that it was inspired by Universal horror movies. In fact, many people feel that this is the best version of Dracula ever.While not a critical or commercial success, The Monster Squad has become a cult classic. Platinum Dunes was going to remake it at one point, but luckily that never came to pass. The end of this film, where Frankenstein willingly goes into the portal makes me as sad as the end of Son of Kong every single time that I see it.",The Monster Squad
13,Coventry,"They did the Monster Mash, it was a Graveyard Smash",6,3 May 2013,"Although I have pretty much seen every significant (and insignificant, for that matter) horror movie of the 1980's, I can't quite give a proper reason why ""The Monster Squad"" escaped me throughout all these years. Fact is that my first viewing of this widely popular cult semi-classic is at least 20 years overdue and therefore I can't help thinking that my rating and impressions would presumably haven been a lot more enthusiastic if I had seen it at a more tender age. Still, even through the eyes of a skeptical and experienced 30-something genre buff, ""The Monster Squad"" nevertheless remains an enjoyable brew of horror, comedy and kids film. First and foremost the film is one giant amiable homage to Universal's classic monster cycle: ""Dracula"", ""Frankenstein"" (both 1931), ""The Wolf Man"" (1941""), ""The Mummy"" (1932) and the often overlooked ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954). If I would have seen this movie when I was a lot younger, it certainly would have sparked my interest to seek out these golden oldies, and that's quite a praiseworthy accomplishment for a modestly produced 80's B-flick. And like Universal Studios themselves already attempted during the 1940's, writers Fred Dekker and Shane Black bring all these legendary horror icons together into one giant mad monster party. The plot is ludicrously simple, but effective and engaging enough. Once per century, evil masterminds have the opportunity to rule the world if – and only if – they conquer a magical amulet. Count Dracula has set his mind on this, and therefore he summons his fellow monster mates Mummy, Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster and the Gill Man. Our fate and salvation lies in the small hands of boys who barely even hit puberty! These horror-obsessed and rather geeky social outcasts gather in their tree house (nicely decorated with vintage old posters) and chatter about horror movies until now, in fact, they find themselves actually trapped in one. ""The Monster Squad"" is particularly fun to spot all the obvious and less obvious references to genre classics and, of course, to admire the supreme monstrous creations by Stan Winston and his collaborators. Unfortunately, and this is mainly the mature horror fanatic speaking, there are too many soft and semi-childish plot twists (like the whole friendship between the Frankenstein monster and the little sister) as well as some tedious parts. Good, solid direction by Fred Dekker. If you haven't yet, make sure to watch his debut feature ""Night of the Creeps"", which is the total definition of 80's B-movie entertainment!",The Monster Squad
14,Hey_Sweden,"""My name...is HORACE!""",7,27 October 2019,"A likeable gang of pre-teens and teenagers are devoted to classic movie monsters. They then get the shock of their lives when they realize that the monsters are all too real. Dracula (Duncan Regehr) shows up, looking for an all-important amulet that, if destroyed at a very particular moment, will allow Evil to reign on Earth. But the caped and fanged one will get by with a little help from his friends: the Frankenstein monster (Tom Noonan), the Wolf Man (Carl Thibault), the Gill Man (Tom Woodruff Jr.), and the Mummy (Michael Reid MacKay).""The Monster Squad"" was the other 80s favourite written and directed by Fred Dekker, who'd previously done the equally fun ""Night of the Creeps"". His whole hook is ""The Little Rascals meet the Universal Monsters"", and, as such, it's an appealing, high energy horror / fantasy / action flick. People may argue that it lacks guts and vigor, but it IS aimed at a juvenile audience, so this hardly matters. It's bolstered by a very appealing cast of kids - Andre Gower, Robby Kiger (the original ""Children of the Corn""), Brent Chalem, Ashley Bank, Michael Faustino, Ryan Lambert. And for adults, there's an appeal in a steady supply of familiar character actors and actresses in supporting roles: Stephen Macht, Mary Ellen Trainor, Stan Shaw, Leonardo Cimino, Jon Gries, Jack Gwillim, David Proval, Robert Lesser. Sharp featured Cimino is especially great as ""Scary German Guy"", who, in one very brief but interesting touch, is revealed to be a Holocaust survivor. Noonan, who has hit paydirt with a number of creepy and menacing roles over the decades (like Francis Dollarhyde in ""Manhunter"" the previous year) is an endearing Frankenstein monster, who poses absolutely no threat to the young heroes.There's a fair bit to enjoy here: rousing music by Bruce Broughton, good widescreen photography, a heavy dose of humour (the zippy script was written by Dekker and Shane Black), fun monster design by Stan Winston, and the razzle-dazzle visual effects done by Richard Edlunds' Boss Film Corporation. The film only runs a scant 82 minutes, so it doesn't take much time to work up to a real fever pitch.""The Monster Squad"" is famous for one particular line uttered by Chalem, which people can't help but quote nearly every time the film gets a mention.It's too bad that the lack of success experienced by ""RoboCop 3"" derailed Dekkers' career for a while; clearly, he did have it takes to create genre films that endure for adoring fans.Seven out of 10.",The Monster Squad
15,poolandrews,Fun homage to the classic film monsters but a little disappointing when all said & done.,7,19 July 2005,"The Monster Squad starts with a paragraph of text that reads 'One hundred years before this story begins it was a time of darkness in Transylvania... A time when Dr. Abraham Van Helsing and a small band of freedom fighters conspired to rid the world of Vampires and Monsters and to save mankind from the eternal forces of evil... They blew it.' The Monster Squad consist of Sean Crenshaw (Andre Gower), Patrick (Robby Kiger), Horace (Brent Chalem), Eugene (Micheal Faustino), Rudy (Ryan Lambert) & Pete the dog, together they are, well actually I'm not sure other than kids who like monsters. During a cargo flight the co-pilot (Daryl Anderson) decides to investigate a noise in the hold & discovers Count Dracula (Duncan Regehr) whom he jettisons' out of the bay doors along with a large crate marked Frankenstein. Dracula brings Frankenstein's creature (Tom Noonan) back to life & together with the Mummy (Micheal Reid MacKay), the Gillman (Tom Woodruff Jr.) & a Werewolf (Carl Thibault) intends to find & use an ancient amulet which will let creatures of the night rule the world, or something like that. It appears the only people who can stop Dracula & his gang of monsters is Sean & The Monster Squad as his mum Emily Crenshaw (Mary Ellen Trainor) has just given him a book she brought which appears to be Van Helsing's (Jack Gwillim) dairy, a diary which reveals how to destroy the amulet & all things evil in general. The fate of the entire world hangs in the balance & rests in the capable hands of The Monster Squad!Co-written & directed by Fred Dekker I liked The Monster Squad but it also disappointed somewhat. The jokey script by Dekker & Shane Black lets the wonderful premise down, badly at times. While any true horror fan will rejoice & get a kick out of the updated monsters & fun homages if you take this novelty idea away The Monster Squad is a very poor film. At times it feels like the Monsters are there for background decoration only with the Mummy & the Gillman being almost totally ignored & unused until the Mummy gets an awful death scene where his bandage is unravelled like some terrible visual gag out of a Scooby-Doo episode. The Gillman is even worse as he gets almost no screen time before he is simply just shot dead by the most annoying member of The Monster Squad. The Wolfman gets a little bit more screen time but not much with Count Dracula & Frankenstein featuring the most which is a shame because out of the monsters these were my least favourite. The special effects make up on the monsters by Stan Winston are excellent especially the Mummy & Gillman which makes it even worse that they are totally ignored for most of the film. There are various plot holes in The Monster Squad like how did Dracula know Sean had the diary among others? There isn't much of a story when it comes down to it either, I was disappointed that the filmmakers didn't use the monsters more & have a bit more imagination in updating them for modern audiences, impressive special effects apart. On a positive note The Monster Squad still remains terrific entertainment & great fun, it moves along at a nice pace & it never becomes boring or dull especially since it only lasts for 80 odd minutes. The effects on the monsters are great as I've said but the optical effects are poor such as the vortex or Count Dracula changing into a bat. There is no blood or gore either apart from when the Wolfman is blown up & Count Dracula is impaled on a spike. Technically The Monster Squad is good with nice production values throughout & the opening credits sequence set in Transylvania 100 years ago looking particularly handsome with Count Dracula's flaming torch lit castle complete with revolting villagers... Overall I liked The Monster Squad, it's a fun homage to classic film monsters but I just can't help thinking that more could have been done with them & the idea. Good but not brilliant, still definitely worth a watch for anyone interested in monsters & horror though.",The Monster Squad
16,Bunuel1976,"THE MONSTER SQUAD (Fred Dekker, 1987) ***",7,20 October 2007,"Though I claim it is my second viewing of this film, some of the events and character features were so clear in my head that I can't believe I've only seen it once almost 20 years ago! In any case, this is a solidly-crafted, fast-paced and witty spoof of the old Universal monster mashes with Count Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, The Wolf Man, The Mummy and The Gill Man all taking part. Duncan Regehr scores best as a nasty Dracula, but Jack Gwillim is a welcome presence in the prologue and finale as his eternal nemesis Abraham Van Helsing. Though essentially a kiddie film with a group of hardened horror addicts/misfits as its main protagonists, it doesn't shy away from gruesome and dangerous situations  the partner to the cop (father to the leader of the Squad) is blown up by Dracula; the Werewolf is himself made to explode in mid-air (a short-term demise, since he recomposes himself only to be shot down by the proverbial silver bullet); Dracula kidnaps and vampirizes three female students, etc. Predictably, the Frankenstein Monster is shown to be of a benign nature after all  he eventually befriends the kids and almost dispatches Dracula himself! Amusingly enough, it was also quite refreshing to hear the boys swearing profusely and saying the word ""virgin"" a lot  without actually knowing what it means! Though I feel that GREMLINS (1984) is still the touchstone for this sort of ""kiddie"" horror comedy, THE MONSTER SQUAD lags not too far behind: it was actually nice to learn that this was no childhood fluke, and that the film still holds up well after all these years. By the way, I followed it with Dekker's previous effort  NIGHT OF THE CREEPS (1986).",The Monster Squad
17,utgard14,The Forces of Evil Better Run and Hide,10,22 February 2014,"Dracula has plans of world domination and recruits his fellow monsters to help. But he didn't count on a group of misfit kids (and monster movie fans) standing in his way. One of my absolute favorite movies from my childhood. It combines two of my favorite things: the 1980s and Universal monster movies. Universal had nothing to do with the making of this movie but the monsters seen here are undeniably based on those classic films.Wonderful direction from cult favorite Fred Dekker. The script, by Dekker and Shane Black, is smart and funny. For a so-called kids' movie, it's not watered down or cloying. It's actually often politically incorrect, which I have to admit feels like a breath of fresh air these days. Fans of '80s movies and nostalgia junkies like myself will get a huge kick out of this one. It even has an '80s-style music montage as the kids prepare for battle (""Rock Until You Drop"").The monsters are terrific and the makeup effects are some of the best in decades. Wolf Man, Mummy, Gill Man, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula in man-bat form all look amazing. Jon Gries is great as the Larry Talbotesque human who fears the full moon's effects on him. Duncan Regehr's Dracula is menacingly evil and a spectacular villain. Tom Noonan makes for a sympathetic and endearing Frankenstein's monster. The Monster Squad itself is comprised of some impressive kid actors who surprisingly never went on to bigger things. The inclusion of concentration camp survivor ""Scary German Guy"" to the film was a nice touch. Something like that would seem cliché today but back then it was novel and refreshing. He's played brilliantly by Leonardo Cimino.This is a fantastic movie made at possibly the last time you could have made something like this and have it work. If it were made today it would be an overblown mess with emphasis on CGI. It's an homage to the great films of the past while adding some fun contemporary touches that still hold up today. Most importantly, it is fun from start to finish. If you haven't seen it and you aren't uptight, check it out immediately. You won't be disappointed!",The Monster Squad
18,Boba_Fett1138,"Good fun for children, that could had been a genre classic as well, had they done more with its concept.",7,9 May 2012,"There is simply no denying that this movie is good and fun to watch for children but I just can't help but to feel and think that the movie could had been so much more and such a better one, with some adjustments to it.The problem I had with this movie was that it felt like fun and an adventurous movie but once you really start thinking about it, there isn't an awful lot happening in this movie. It sounds strange, since the movie still works as entertainment as it is but the movie at the same time still feels like a bit of a waste of a fine concept.There was so much more to explore and do with its concept. Here we have a movie that stars all of the classic movie monsters such as Dracula, the Frankenstein creature, a wolfman, a mummy and even the gill man, in a movie aimed toward young teens. But there is actually very little happening in the movie, which is also really due to its script, that just doesn't a very solid or original main plot line in it.Yet it really isn't a boring movie but even though that the movie is fun, it just never gets off the ground as any good or involving enough entertainment. Things remain quite shallow and underdeveloped and I'm talking about both the story and all of the characters that are in it. Even the villains, that are all horror icons of course, remain a bit boring, also because their villainous plot never really becomes clear or threatening enough.It's definitely a good looking and well made movie though. It just suffers from its uninspired script, though the movie still has some strong points as well to its story. One of those things is that nicely puts its emphasis on its kid characters and tells the movie from their perspective. It should make everybody feel young again and remind you of how uncomplicated life was at a pre-teen age. Things were still very black and white and all of your problems seemed to be trivial in today's perspective. All of the kid characters interact very well and realistically with each other, which is something that this movie truly benefits from.Really, despite of all my criticism, I believe that this is still a pretty good movie for young kids, who will probably appreciate and enjoy it all better. Especially young boys, that are also into horror stuff as well.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Monster Squad
19,view_and_review,"This is ""The Squad""",8,4 September 2019,"Sorry Trump, we can't acknowledge the four women you dubbed ""the squad"" because we recognize four boys from the 80's as being ""the squad.""I think the Monster Squad could've been a franchise. Sure, there was the every 100 years thing but I think they could've figured away around that. There were so many unexplored monsters to vanquish. There are goblins, trolls, ogres, witches, zombies and more. They could've been a Supernatural before Dean and Sam.The Monster Squad was a group of kids with a monster obsession that just so happen to come in handy. They believed when nobody else did and it's a good thing they did because they saved the world from evil.",The Monster Squad
20,morrison-dylan-fan,"""They did the mash, They did the monster mash.""",8,19 March 2018,"Talking to a fellow poster on a movie message board,I mentioned that my favourite version of Zorro is the New World TV series. At the same time,I sold a DVD for a family friend on Ebay. Taking a look at the case before sending it off,I was surprised to see that it starred Zorro! This led to me quickly joining the squad.View on the film:Looking every bit as debonaire as he did playing Zorro, Duncan Regehr gives a wicked performance as Dracula , whose given a regal stand by Reghr that causes the other characters to drop their guard, allowing Reghr to sink Drac's fangs into pulpy one-liners. Joining in the monster bash, Tom Noonan gives a child-like innocence to the foot-stomping Frankenstein's creature.Joining the squad with Shane Black making his screenwriting debut,co-writer/director Fred Dekker crisply builds upon his Horror Comedy origins of House,with Black's snappy dialogue. Black & Dekker show themselves to have been ahead of their time,thanks to the quick landing on the monsters,allowing the writers to fly past the set-up,to instead land wonderful tributes to Universal monster movies and Stephen King.Putting The Monster Squad up against a gallery of famous monsters, director Dekker impressively does not shy away in going for full-on horror,via Stan Winston's classic practical effects being shown at their very best,and the colourful use of matte paintings and red lights giving a pulpy atmosphere to the monster squad.",The Monster Squad
21,AaronCapenBanner,Goonies Meets Ghostbusters,3,1 October 2013,"Fred Dekker directs this cross between ""The Goonies"" & ""Ghostbusters"" as a group of kids who are devoted to old horror films and their iconic characters(Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, and The Gill Man) get to meet the real things as they arrive nearby to retrieve an ancient amulet that will give Dracula control over the balance of good & evil, when a portal is reopened. Only the kids(who have a tree house for headquarters) can stop them.Good cast cannot save this feeble and overproduced story that wobbles haphazardly from comedy to horror, and seems confused about fictional monsters vs. real monsters. Awfully contrived and nonsensical, though may appeal to kids, and is certainly a cult film.",The Monster Squad
22,Aaron1375,"Even as a kid, I did not care for this monster squad.",3,7 July 2009,"The previews alone were enough to make me not want to see this film as a kid and when my dad rented it I was rewarded with what I thought I was going to be rewarded with...an annoying movie. The kids are indeed as annoying as they seemed on the previews, the whole kick him in the nards was incredibly stupid and repeated over and over during the trailers of the film, and the cast is a bunch of people you will never see again. I have seen adult movies with more recognizable stars than this boring foray into monster hunting. Probably seemed like a sure hit when it was pitched initially...we have some kids and we have some classic movie monsters, it will be like a Goonies II, however we will add bad plot points and stupid story and some kids out of some random playground to save on money. Do not worry though we will have a nard joke. Yes, I am somewhat sure that is what the pitch was like. I think this movie had some potential, but it just misses the mark. It just needed a little polishing of the script an entirely new cast of kids, and some stars in the roles of the monsters, especially Dracula.",The Monster Squad
23,The_Void,Cheesy high camp in a good time flick!,7,16 July 2006,"What we have here is an eighties version of the same idea that Stephen Sommers would have almost two decades on, just before he made the terrible 'Van Helsing'. In this film, we have five of Universal's most famous monsters - Dracula, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster and (best of all) The Creature From the Black Lagoon, all moulded into a plot that follows a bunch of kids that group themselves into 'The Monster Squad' to battle the classic fiends. Director Fred Dekker is undoubtedly most famous for his cult classic 'Night of the Creeps', and while this follow-up isn't quite as good; it certainly shows the director's talent for making enjoyable lightweight horror films, and this film triumphs because it throws caution to the wind where logic and seriousness is concerned; and plays out solely for a good time. The film opens with a sequence that sees Van Helsing attempting to thwart the evil Dracula, before moving swiftly to the modern day where we are introduced to a bunch of monster-obsessed kids who, after a series of odd occurrences; begin to believe that the movie monsters are about to take over the world.By keeping the film true to all the rules of the classic Universal films, Fred Dekker gives it a sort of credibility over and above what a film of this nature should have; and that is the main reason why the film works so well. Dekker manages to ensure that the film will appeal to two big horror audiences; fans of the classics will appreciate the plot and humour, while young kids are bound to get a kick out of the characters and their witty dialogue. The film is very short, running at just over eighty minutes; and while the plot that we do have is meaty enough considering the type of film; this is one of the few occasions where a lack of padding actually harms the film. Somehow, Dekker manages to gives ample screen time to all the monsters, however; and just as was the case in Universal's attempts to blend their monster flicks together, it is The Wolf Man that gets the best scenes. One major criticism of the film that I'd like to make is that Duncan Regehr is not charismatic enough in the role of Dracula, and the other monsters are all bigger highlights than him. Still, there is only one Bela Lugosi; and the fact that the cast of child actors isn't annoying in the slightest more than makes up for this. Overall, The Monster Squad is a great slice of eighties kitsch and comes highly recommended to the right people!",The Monster Squad
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,Happy Halloween!,9,27 July 2011,"So a few months ago I was watching an internet reviewer who was talking about good Halloween movies to watch. One of the films that he highly recommended was The Monster Squad, the weird thing is being a huge movie buff, I had never heard of this movie. But it looked really cool from the clips he was showing, so I decided to just buy the movie and I am glad I did. One of the things I am a huge fan of is the old Universal horror movies, like Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man, etc. But during the 80's it was more about making new horror icons like Jason and Freddy. Being brought back together in a clever updated way, we get to see all the icons together being led by Dracula. It's so odd because I don't know if this was a kid's movie, a family movie or a true horror film, I think the answer is yes. I wonder what kind of effect this movie would have had on me if I saw it as a child vs. an adult, but honestly I had an absolute wonderful time watching it in my 20's, and this is definitely a great film to watch during Halloween.The Monster Squad is a club of pre-teens who idolize classic monsters and monster movies and hold their meetings in a tree clubhouse. Sean is given the diary of legendary vampire hunter Van Helsing - but his excitement is toned down when he finds it's written in German. Sean, his best friend Patrick, and the rest of the Monster Squad get their neighbor who is German to translate the diary. The diary describes, in great detail, an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise-indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction, and the next day of balance falls within a couple days, at the stroke of midnight. The kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet before the day of balance arrives; once they have the amulet, the kids can use it to open a hole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. Dracula, meanwhile, seeks to obtain the amulet before the Monster Squad does, so that the Count can take control of the world.The kids are absolutely hilarious! Almost like seeing if The Goonies took on the old monsters, we have a whole different variety of the cliché kids. Plus they have one of the coolest lines in film history with ""Wolfman's got nards!"", that was too priceless. Seeing Frankenstein and the little sister together was both charming and very funny to watch. I love that Frankenstein isn't the typical monster that he's normally made out to be since he is more of a tragic figure and he's a good guy in the film. I think why this film is so great is because of the chemistry between the kids and the rest of the cast. Plus I have to admit that I was a weird kid who absolutely adored horror movies and this just took me back. It could take us all back to a time where monsters were cool, even though I'm pretty sure we wouldn't want to defeat them in a battle, but they were fun to talk about and watch on the big screen. Remember Halloween? When it was about getting dressed up and getting candy and coming home and pigging out and watching a scary movie? The Monster Squad gave me the chance to be a kid again and I adore this movie, totally worth the buy.9/10",The Monster Squad
25,thesar-2,The Ghoulies Gang,5,21 March 2013,"A friend recommended The Monster Squad to me and I have one thing to say to him: Where werewolf you 26 years ago?!MeaningI grew up on these very monster characters when I was a wee-youngling. Heck, I even adored, to this day, the Monster Cereals, such as Count Chocula, Franenberry and Booberry. The tad-bit history on that: I've always loved and have been infatuated with horror since I can remember. But, since I was forbidden to watch Rated-R fare, and since 99.997% of real horror was R or worse, I had to latch onto Movie Horror Greats of decades before me. I.E. Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and especially the Wolf-Man.This movie was beyond-below my radar growing up and even into my ""adulthood"" (yeah, even at my old age, I'm still wondering when I will feel like an adult.) Sure, I've heard of it, but since I missed it as a kid and heard so little buzz, I never thought of seeing it.Until that friend recommended it to me.I'm very sad I did NOT see this as kid. It would've satisfied ALL of my needs: adventure, horror, all the monsters I loved and all in one place and best yet: these kids were my age when this movie was released. How could I not relate and absolutely fall into the film and create my fantasies of how I would react? I did that with Escape to Witch Mountain and Back to the Future; I would've certainly seen this dozens of times knowing myself.I digress. I cannot change the past and despite my 5/10 star rating, I really didn't have a problem seeing this as an adult. It's enormously eighties and gory-yet-mild enough to really get a PG rating vs. its PG-13 rating. It's fun for what it is, despite all its obvious flaws.Without giving away too many spoilers for the other loved-horror-as-a-kid-now-adults who haven't seen this either, the number one flaw was the fact a ""virgin"" is needed to read some scribe so the kids scramble to find the closest female virgin to read the words that might banish the villains when, all the whilenever thinking to pick one of the boys in the title's ""Monster Squad"" of kids. They're all obviously virgins, especially the fat one.(Before I get hate (e)mail, I would ever have referred to him as ""fat"" if the script didn't call him as that multiples of times.)Uh, I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie's about the legend band of cinematic monsters, mostly portrayed in the 1930s/1940s classic Universal films, who are real and face a (mostly boys) club of horror-movie monster fans. Inevitably, they find the way to destroyallmonsterswhen no one takes them seriously.The special effects are surprisingly good for the type of film it is, the acting isn't too bad, some of the comedy is actually pretty amusing and the adventure for the young at heart is intact. Deep? Not really. The Goonies kind of take on horror? Yeah. But, if you're a boy at heartuh, I mean, I'm referring to those like me: maleyou might find this (mostly) family-fun and scary adventure a joy to watch.Thank you, you-know-who-you-are, friend. I will most certainly watch this again, and you know what? I doubt that 5/10 star rating will remain that low.",The Monster Squad
26,lost-in-limbo,Youthful bliss.,6,4 May 2020,"I was never a big fan of Monster Squad the first time I saw it, when my friend who is a fan, lent it out to me. I was in my late teens and it felt like nostalgia played a big part towards how much you like it. So, I hadn't seen it since, but after all that time. I watched it at a cinema with an excited audience and it was infectiously enjoyable. Everything about its witty dialogues, referential in-jokes and the kids' chemistry hit a lot harder in capturing the youthful bliss and a sense of wonder around the scary unknown. The monster FX had always impressed me, rather old-school atmospherics, yet fitting the spirit of what Fred Dekker was trying to achieve. I just wished there was less Goonie hijinks, and a little more monster mash. Pointing at you; the creature. While for me, it might not have the nostalgia factor, however this time around was a fun, breezy good-time.",The Monster Squad
27,Cineanalyst,Kiddie Monster Rally Has Some Charm,6,9 July 2018,"I don't have any nostalgia for these sorts of children's movies, but I admit that ""The Monster Squad"" is charming in parts. And, as a comedy, it works about as well as, say, ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948), which isn't bad. The ""Wolf man's got nards"" line and the ""dorking"" comments, however, are atrocious. On the other hand, ""The Monster Squad"" almost seems daring compared to today's kiddie fare considering that it consists of some mild curse words, which I'm not even sure I'm allowed to repeat on IMDb. And, kids can be bigots, so it's realistic that the ones in this movie spout homophobic slurs and mock people for their appearances and other superficial qualities. One kid is called ""the fat kid"" repeatedly throughout, for example, and a Holocaust survivor is referred to as the ""scary German guy."" But, the kids are curious, and they have a passion that's contagious.Dracula and the Frankenstein creature make out the best among the monster rally: one is a solid villain and the other a sympathetic monster. The Wolf Man plays out his usual Jekyll/Hyde identity crisis, as a repentant man and a deranged animal, but the werewolf costume is pretty bad. Gillman and the Mummy have little to do, and the three brides of Dracula are especially too slow to be a menace. The semordnilap of ""Alucard,"" also employed in other Dracula movies, ""Son of Dracula"" (1943) and ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" (1972), is repeated here for no apparent reason and for further no apparent reason the kid sees what he can spell by mixing up the words. The pairing of the little girl with the Frankenstein monster is a better reference and reworking of a classic horror film, ""Frankenstein"" (1931). In general, ""The Monster Squad"" is a sincere homage and charming successor to the classic monster movies.(Mirror Note: The German proves to the kids he's not a vampire by pointing out that he has a reflection in a mirror.)",The Monster Squad

Boy, am I happy to see it and I can gladly say that it's the best movie of the month. This movie features a bunch of kids who find out Dracula is returning to destroy a magic amulet that will keep him from going into another dimension. He gets help from the other movie monsters to help him. I will admit that this isn't the most suitable film for kids, but it's still quite fun. It's mostly because the pacing is so good. At first, I did think it was a little slow but it really caught up after twenty minutes.In a movie that's only 82 minutes long, that's important. The movie itself is basically just awesome. It's a meeting of classic movie monsters with stuff blowing up too! Unlike a Michael Bay film, it actually has the characters act like real people and the people are much smarter here. It's a great looking film and I really do show concern for what happens to everybody. It's not as good as ""The Goonies"" but is still a enjoyable Halloween flick.

30,CuriosityKilledShawn,The Goonies 'R' Not Good Enough,7,31 March 2011,"The similarities between the Monster Squad and the Goonies are numerous, but while The Goonies is a more expansive and recognizable movie, I prefer this one. Produced by Peter Hyams and Rob Cohen, and with a script by Fred Dekker and Shane Black, the Monster Squad had a lot of creative talent behind it, so why did it fall into a limbo like the one featured in the movie? Set in small-town America, a bunch of young kids form a monster-movie fan club in their eccentric treehouse. But when REAL classic monsters show up (that would be the Wolfman, Gillman, the Mummy, Frankenstein's monster, AND Dracula) they begin to look deeper into their origin with the help of Van Helsing's diary.I'd love to explain the film further, but the execs at TriStar Pictures ordered 15 minutes to be cut from the film, which results in a huge loss of coherence in the first act, thus creating many plot holes. Just where did the monsters come from? If Dracula's cargo was randomly jettisoned over small-town America, how come the amulet he's looking for just-so-happens to be there? Some scenes in this film are almost over before they begin. It's very frustrating. The credits begin to roll at the 77-minute mark too, so whoever thought that the film was overlong was clearly a fool.For years, the Monster Squad was available only on a long out-of-print VHS release. Naturally, as was the logic at the time, this was a pan-and-scan version which butchered the film's brilliant anamorphic composition.Fred Dekker killed his career beyond redemption with RoboCop 3, but The Monster Squad and Night of the Creeps will forever stand as two low-budget horror homages from a decade that endorsed risk-taking.",The Monster Squad
31,ironhorse_iv,"This movie got nards! It doesn't play it, safe. Monster Squad is one of the best movie to watch on Halloween! A scary, good-time!",7,31 October 2015,"This movie mash is a graveyard smash! Though this horror comedy was not a success on its initial release in 1987, it subsequently developed an even-larger cult following, every year. Directed by Fred Dekker, and written by Shane Black. The movie tells the story of a group of kids call the Monster Squad, whom job is it, to stop a series of monsters, leaded by Count Dracula (Duncan Regehr), from taking over the world. Without spoiling the movie, too much; while it might seem, a bit silly and over-the top. It's honestly, a lot of fun to watch. I love, every minute of it! Yes, the extreme violence & gore, profanity, and dirty sex appeal might turn off, some parents from allowing their kids to watch this PG-13 film. However, as a kid of the early 1990s, I found this movie to be, awesome. Even, now as a mature adult, I find this movie, still very much, appealing; and wouldn't mind, allowing my children to see it, if they wanted to. After all, it's a lot tamer, than what children, see in movies, nowadays. Despite, being a little dated, there is a lot to like. I love how great the Universal Monsters: The Mummy (Michael MacKay), The Gill-man (Tom Woodruff Jr.), The Wolf Man (Carl Thibault), and The Frankenstein's Monster (Tom Noonan), looked. However, some of the other, special effects, needed some work, such as the bats. Still, great work from Stan Winston and his team of special effects artists. Another thing, I like is, how well-acted, all the creatures were. Tom Noonan as Frankenstein's Monster & Duncan Regehr as Count Dracula are the best stand-outs. I love, their chemistry when face with the youngest member of the Monster Squad. It was iconic. Another great scene is the famous, Wolf Man got nards, scene. Even if, you never saw this film. You have, at least, heard of that scene! It's everywhere on the internet as a meme. If you have, saw this movie, you might agree with me, that for the most part, the film has pretty good pacing. There wasn't many boring or slow spots in Monster Squad. The movie is full of gut-blasting action, that you can't take, your eyes away from. Not only does, this movie treat your eyes, it also feeds your ears, some of the best 1980's kid movies music, you'll ever, listen to. This film indeed has an awesome soundtrack. Rock until you drop by Michael Sembello was truly rocking! Still, there are some things that I didn't like, about the film. Examples are, how respective clichéd all the main characters, are. Sean (Andree Gower), Patrick (Robby Kiger), Horace AKA Fat Kid, (Brent Chalem), Rudy (Ryan Lambert), Eugene (Michael Faustino) & Phoebe (Ashley Bank) don't have much, complexity. In my opinion, Eugene being the worst of the group. He literally does nearly nothing to help, further the plot. I really didn't like, the character, at all. I also dislike, the child's acting. He was so annoying. The other child actors weren't that bad, but they sure, wasn't great. It was just mediocre, at best. Another thing, worth criticizing, is the nonsensical plot. The movie doesn't do, a good job, explains, how the monsters got, in the present day. No part of this movie made any sense. The amulet, the diary, the search for a virgin, and even, the large amounts of weapons & explosives, they able to use. All these things, needed more exposition. It was so badly delivered. The worst, had to be Sean figuring out, that the monsters are alive, by finding out that Mr. Alucard is indeed Count. Dracula. It gave me, horrible 1990's Troll 2 flashbacks. Then, there, was the moments in the film, where this film, went to really dark, deep implications at times. A good example of this, is how the ""Scary German Guy"" (Leonardo Cimino), know so much about monsters. It was very jarring, compare to the rest of light-hearted and relax parts of the film. The movie also went, a little overboard on the mean-spirited jokes. I get the film, was going for uber-realistic on how, children, at the time, acted, but gees, some of the things, these kids, say, are, very offensive insults. Overall: This 1980's cheesy high camp, horror comedy is a trick or treat flick, worth-checking out! Highly Entertaining. Do recommended.",The Monster Squad

The film centres on a bunch of school age children, who are obsessed with the classic Universal Movie monsters. When the actual monsters come to their small town, on the hunt for a medallion that would allow Dracula to rule the world, the boys, with the help of Van Helsing's notebook try to complete an ancient ritual that would cast Dracula into Limbo. I'm prepared to gloss over some aspects of the movies failings, really I am. It's filmed on an awful 80's film stock that makes the film look grainy and washed out. The script has quite a few homophobic slurs that are quite jarring to hear today (although probably realistic for the time) as is the fact that one character is called ""Fat Kid"" even by his friends. The revenge porn subplot also wouldn't make it into the movie, if it was made with our modern sensibilities. That said, Stan Winston's effects are pretty good, especially given that the film has a relatively small budget. The acting is a mixed bag, with the monsters doing quite well but the kids not so much. And I got a real ""Evil Dead"" vibe from the Skeletons and the portal that appear in the prologue . .though really that just made me want to watch ""Evil Dead""One of the trivia points for the film says that the producers demanded 14 minutes of cuts to get the film to under 90 minutes - it feels like all the bits that were cut were the expositional sections or the motivational explanations. How does Dracula know where the pendant he's searching for is? If he's drawn to it, why has it taken a century for him to come to America? Who makes the call to the family that alerts Sean to the fact that Dracula is in town, and why? You feel like Van Helsing's book should have played a bigger part, leading all the characters to the house that used to be his, and the pendant . . . but if that is the case it's all up to you to surmise, because the film doesn't tell you. Also, Sean's parent's marriage is failing - but for no real story reason. The film doesn't use it as an excuse to, for example, explain why he's not noticed sneaking out but there's also no reconciliation at the end - it's just meaningless. A good idea, with good effects, but appallingly delivered. It cries out for a decent remake like few other films I've seen.",The Monster Squad

This begins long ago in Transylvania with Abraham Van Helsing and his team heading to a castle fighting the forces of evil. We move to the present meeting boys, Sean (Gower) and Patrick (Kiger) who are monster fanatics deciding to form a club. The late, Chalem plays their friend, Horace, Lambert plays their older friend, Rudy, Bank plays Sean's kid sister, Phoebe and Macht (Graveyard Shift) plays Sean's father, Del who is a cop. Soon, Sean and the others discover that their monster icons are real when Count Dracula (Regehr) comes and tries to wreak havoc with monsters, The Mummy, Gil Man, Frankenstein (Noonan) and The Wolfman (Gries). Frankenstein is sent by Dracula to retrieve an ancient diary of Van Helsing, but he becomes Sean's ally and also becomes close with Phoebe. I've liked this since I was a kid, it's got creepy & a bit of humorous moments, the cast is decent, Bruce Broughton's score is great and it's nice to see all the classic monsters together in one film. I recommend this 80's horror gem.",The Monster Squad

With the help of ""Scary German Guy,"" his old tome of spells, a virgin, and a magic amulet, it seems they are well on their way to greatness.""Whoa!

And when it came to the old monster movies it was like parents went out of their way to make sure their kids saw them all. So my friends and I had a bit of background walking into this.That might have added to the appeal...or it could have been the fact that ""Wolfman has nards"" or just the fact that the mom was Mary Ellen Trainor and we knew her as the mother of the Goonies and Lethal Weapon and Romancing the Stone and she was sort of like the mom of the '80s so we had that family feel to it.She was everywhere wasn't she? At least she was in all the important movies that kids that were kids in the '80s watched. Emphasis on ""important."" And adventure horror comedy. Kids that grew up when I did loved horror-comedies, it has been a part of our souls since the days of Scooby-Doo. Scary and funny and perfect for little boys.It was ""The Goonies"" with monsters. Who wouldn't love it? Frankenstein instead of Sloth. ""The Monster Squad"" instead of ""The Goonies"" and a little girl instead of Chunk.It is a formula made for little boys, and, believe it or not, it aged just as well as The Goonies.",The Monster Squad

Do you think that ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) or ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (1975) became cult classics overnight? (Actually, they did.) ""The Monster Squad,"" like nearly all cult movies, was dismissed by most critics and audiences upon its 1987 release, but fan demand has given this film a wondrous afterlife on home video, culminating in a glorious DVD with enough special features to make any fan proud.The movie, a sort of cross-pollination between four distinct sources - ""Ghostbusters,"" ""The Goonies,"" ""Stand by Me,"" and all the classic Universal Pictures monster movies - that combines these elements of such distant cult favorites and rolls them into its own creative universe. I loved watching this movie when I was a kid. ""The Monster Squad"" was one of my favorite movies from my childhood as a young kid growing up in the '80s. It scared me, and delighted me with its mix of adventure, horror and comedy, compliments of co-screenwriter/director Fred Dekker and co-screenwriter Shane Black.""The Monster Squad"" is purely nostalgia. What happens here, is that Count Dracula is in town, with a few days to kill. Apparently he wants to bring about the end of the world and he needs an ancient amulet to help him do it. So he calls upon the classic movie monsters (who have each been given a present-day update by special effects wizard Stan Winston) - Frankenstein, the Wolf Man, the Mummy, and the Gillman - for further support in his devious plans.To the rescue - who are you gonna call? - the Monster Squad, Dekker's teenage ""monster-busters,"" if you will. Led by courageous young Sean (Andre Gower), and his friends and fellow monster hunters Patrick (Robby Kiger), ""Fat Kid"" Horace (Brent Chalem), Eugene (Michael Faustino) and Rudy (Ryan Lambert), they sharpen their stakes, round up silver bullets (using mom's fine dinner utensils), and make garlic necklaces and prepare for an epic showdown in town square. Sean also happens to be in possession of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing's diary, which holds the key to defeating Dracula, and he enlists help from the Scary German Guy (Leonard Cimino) who lives down the street to translate it so that they can save the world.OK, so ""The Monster Squad"" is fairly cheesy, with many faithful nods to the monster movies of yesteryear and updating that material for a brain-dead '80s audience. Those not accustomed to the in-joke humor and references will probably look at this movie as cheesy '80s nostalgia. It is indeed nostalgia, but it's good nostalgia from an era that's still fresh, especially if you're still a kid at heart and look at this movie with a kind of gosh-wow, wide-eyed childhood innocence.And of course, there are a lot of hokey performances (Tom Noonan's Frankenstein stands out here) and one-liners (that attempt to make the movie look cool and sometimes fail). You can dismiss that, if you wish. But if you can get past those very few short-comings, then ""The Monster Squad"" is one of the best experiences you'll never forget from your childhood.10/10",The Monster Squad

When no one believes them it is up to the kids to find out why the monsters are in town and how to stop them. This movie is directed by Fred Dekker (Night of the Creeps) and stars Andre Gower (Side Kicks), Stephen Macht (Graveyard Shift), Tom Noonan (Robocop 2), Stan Shaw (Rising Sun) and Jason Hervey (Back to the Future). The storyline for this is so fun in a Goonies kind of way. The dialogue and character interactions are entertaining and so well written. The action scenes and special effects are also great.

In fact, I'd dare say it's the better of the two films. Its spunky and likeable young cast is complimented by some of the best portrayals of the classic monsters ever. Yep, you heard me right. Ever.

However, a group of kids whom happen to be big monster fans must band together in order to thwart Dracula's evil plans. They receive some unexpected assistance when one of the kids manages to befriend one of the monsters. How will our group of monster fanatics fare when faced with the real things?I had many issues with this film; for a start the kids are annoying and generally lacking in any kind of likeability. The story is pretty bland, the monsters themselves aren't scary and them being monsters they naturally have their own limitations (little dialogue or development is afforded making it practically impossible to care for their quest). One particularly monster fanatic Rudy (who comes across as a poor man's Corey Feldman) is a bit of an oddity and doesn't sit well within the group. He's a cool kid who chooses to be friends with a bunch of dweebs with no logical explanation as to why he doesn't hang out with cool kids closer to his own age? He struggles with a lot of the monster trivia so can't even really claim that he's a monster fanatic. Like I say he's an odd fit kind of like a square peg in a round hole. Despite its minimal running time there is so little content and so little that happens that it actually feels twice as long as it actually is. Add ropey special effects and several poor performances and you're left with something that's more of a 'monstrosity' than a monster film.Although I've pointed out several negatives above I think what really takes the cake with this film was the scene where they offer the 5 year old girl as a virgin sacrifice to Dracula? One of the kids says to the German guy (to his 5 year old sister) 'Is she a virgin?' and the German guy says 'Oh yes of course' and then offers her to Dracula? Perhaps it was intended to be humourous, but I just found it a bit queasy and sick and given what has happened with the likes of Jimmy Saville  that have been exposed over the years I just didn't like the idea of a very young child being offered as a virgin sacrifice (whether it be as a plot twist or for laughs). It's this kind of outdated humour that really sinks this film and it would be interesting to see how modern reviews compare to those reviews on here from say 15-20 years ago - I'd be shocked if I'm the only person in the modern era who was mildly horrified by this scene.Aside from a reasonably good performance from Duncan Regehr the film has little else to recommend and is basically just Monster Trash.",The Monster Squad

They were the lamest, most unimaginative iterations possible. The kids performed well enough, but I just wasn't won over by them. The worst is the guy who plays Dracula.

48,fertilecelluloid,Loving tribute to the greats of Monsterdom,8,6 January 2006,"There was a ""Monster Squad"" TV series way before there was a feature film. It was about, as the catchy opening sequence chanted, a guy named Walt, who worked at Fred's wax museum to put himself through criminology college. One night, oscillating vibrations brought to life three legendary monsters...Dracula! The Werewolf...and Frankenstein! I'm sure you get the drift. Despite the fact that Walt didn't bring ""Frankenstein"" back to life (he brought Frankenstein's ""Monster"" back), the series was very similar to Fred Dekker's feature film, although Fred added ""The Mummy"". Made around the same time as ""The Goonies"" and ""Explorers"", this monster flick for young teenage boys is an absolute winner. The scene of ""The Mummy"" unwrapping as he is dragged behind a car is priceless, as is the film's respectful treatment of the legendary Universal monsters. The pace is tight, Dekker's action sequences show evidence of real skill, and the cinematography, by Bradford May, carries photographic echoes of the old black and white flicks that these monsters originally appeared in. An affectionate, loving tribute to the screen's finest fiends.",The Monster Squad
49,aidanratesmovies,Meh,4,5 October 2021,"This is one of those movies that easily could have been better with an extra half hour or so, and yet still felt too long. It started out okay, albeit a bit basic, and then it just delved into nonsense. I find the premise of this film interesting, but it's so haphazardly executed that it doesn't prove to be as fun to watch as it sounds. I'll start with some more positive features of the film- the cinematography is excellent. It captures the tone of the film perfectly- as well as the campy special effects throughout which can be a delight to look at at times. The soundtrack also isn't half bad, with some fun little 80's jams, as well as the makeup of the classic monsters throughout which does seem dated but is really fun. The acting throughout the film is rather mediocre to be honest, and the characters are written almost all the same- mainly loud sarcastic and vulgar little hooligans who for some reason or another are targeted by Dracula and his gang. The plot wears thin as the film goes on, and you lack to see the reason behind why the events are unfolding in the film in the first place. In the end, it's not a film I enjoyed that much, or one I will remember, but it wasn't a total disaster.

I totally see why this has cult status because it's absolutely the kind of movie that would get people to really fall in love with it's quirky charms.

51,vertigo_14,Fred Dekkar's Other Cult Classic,8,16 March 2004,"Prospective Monster Squad viewers may recognize the name Fred Dekkar, the director of another 80s cult classic, a zombie horror called Night of the Creeps. Monster Squad follows in that tradition as the horror-comedy about a gang of young kids who save their town from Dracula and his goons. In my opinion, Monster Squad is a much more enjoyable movie than Night of the Creeps. The Monster Squad refers to a tree house club of five kids who are self-proclaimed horror fanatics. Little did they know that their enthusiasm in the genre would suddenly come in handy as their town in suddenly invaded by Dracula and a few other memorable horror villains in their classic form. Drac is terrorizing the town, trying to locate a powerful amulet which has the potential for serious disaster. When no one else believes the kids, or when no one else is powerful enough to stop them using traditional crime fighting methods (arresting the Wolfman didn't seem to work out), the Monster Squad (with the help of Scary German Guy and Frankenstein) takes things upon themselves to save the day. This movie was great because, although the monsters may appear somewhat corny (not forgetting that it is technically a family horror film), it still has a heap of great qualities. The kids are actually all pretty cool (especially Rudy, even though his wears his pants so tight, you can see what side he tucks on). Great music, great cast (Andre Gower, Robby Kiger, Ryan Lambert, Stephen Macht, and Jon Gries), and great fun!Fans of obscure 80s movies are sure to add to the cult following.

55,Matt_Layden,"""The Goonies Of Horror Flicks.""",8,25 July 2007,"Young kids form a club dedicated to what they love the most, MONSTERS. Although, things get a little bit more hairy when those monsters they love turn out to be real. Sooner then they know, they are fighting of the likes of The Mummy, Gillman, Wolfman and the ultimate bad guy, Dracula.Monster Squad was a film that I had on an old VHS tape recorded off the television. The quality was crappy, the sound was iffy and I loved every minute of it. Sometime over the course of 10 years the tape was lost and my childhood classic was lost forever, until the day it hit DVD. It's more then a decade later and I'm happy to say that this goonies for horror flick still holds up to it's cult classic name.Written by the director himself and Lethal Weapon writer Shane Black, Squad showcases some great dialogue. Most of it is camp and corny one liners spoken by this kids to the monsters and all of it adds to that 80's kid adventure feel. I still laugh at such lines as ""Wolfman has nards"" and ""See ya later, bandage breath"". You can't really take the film seriously, especially when the main character randomly gets Van Helsings diary and some guy named. Dr. Aulcard. wants it (for those who don't know, that's Dracula backwards).What Van Helsing (with Jackman and Beckinsale) failed to do in this decade, Monster Squad did 20 years ago. They brought back the universal monsters and made them fun. Vam Helsing failed horribly with pathetic CGI. Which goes to show that the old school costume and make-up will always be better then CGI. To prevent trademark infringement, the creators altered the appearances of all the monsters, but only slightly so that they would still be recognized.Monster Squad does ride the coat tails of The Goonies, which was released two years prior, but what sets this film apart is that it has no real big stars, it's not a landmark film by any means and it has a small following. Just like every other film that was made decades ago, if you watch it for the first time in today's times, you won't get that same feeling. That feeling that many had watching this film when they were kids. Watching it now you'll lean more towards the negatives of the film; it's bogus plot, it's coincidences, it's short running time and fast pace style, and the fact that it's not as big as it could be.The special effects, mainly the transformation of the wolfman, hold true to this day. Which says big things about this film because it didn't have the biggest budget. From Dracula transforming into a bat, to of course the wolfman transforming into the hairy beast. The scenes that scared me as a kid still hold up to this day and those scenes all involve special effects. Wolfman transforming in the phone booth and his limbs returning to form after being blown up. Gillman from the sewer, Dracula as a half bat half man.Monster Squad has everything from the young kids (the main kid, the bad-ass, the fat one, the innocent one, young sister) to memorable bad guys and even a scary German guy. The climax of the film is the highlight, with great action, effects, comedy, horror, and suspense. It's every kids nightmare; having monsters in their closet, but it's this film that helps kids to get over that. This film gives them a chance to be one of the members of the Monster Squad and kick some monster ass. The ending gave hope to a sequel, but after 20 years nothing happened. I wouldn't mind seeing a remake though, because nothing can really tarnish this cult classic. It will always remain a classic to me.",The Monster Squad

57,lambiepie-2,A real Monster Film for Kids and Teens,8,14 October 2006,"I remember when this came out. I was past the kids and tweens age and what I remember most about this is the harsh reaction it got from critics. I remember parent's groups screaming about ""how bad and violent Monster Squad was for their kids"". But ya know what... this was a good ""monster"" film for kids and teens. I'm surprised they haven't made a sequel. They really should have.I've got to call on my fellow movie junkies from the late 60's and 70's when we were toddlers and children watching TV for this one. Remember when they showed us the old Universal Films late at night -- Dracula, The Wolfman, The Invisible Man, The Mummy, Frankenstein and the gang? Remember the 'all day' Thanksgiving Godzilla marathons? And remember these shows as a kid: ""Creature Feature"", ""Chiller"", ""The CBS Friday Night Late Movie"", ""Dr. Shock"", ""Joe Bob Briggs"", ""Elvira"" and many more across the USA? This film is for OUR kids - make no mistake. The other kids, well, they missed out.Monster Squad was done in the best possible light - it didn't talk down to kids and put them in control when the adults wouldn't believe them that Monsters were taking over their town. Plus there were other monster references beyond the scary ones - the real ones that occurred in History. The children, kids and tweens cast in this film were adorable and cast right. You had your smart alec leader type kid obsessed with monsters, your typical ""fat"" kid, your really adorable little girl/sister type who wants to be a part of everything her older brothers and his friends did and adorable/shy little boy. Shane Black, who was a popular screenwriter of the 80's with Lethal Weapon and the like, knew what he was doing with this one, and Fred Dekker, the director, directed his young staff well. This wasn't silly - it was a believable kids world where kids were the heroes and the parents were thankful they were. The parent's weren't dumb either, that was refreshing.The monsters were as you remember them: the uptight Dracula and his faithful Brides, the misunderstood Frankenstein, The weird Mummy, the conscientious Wolfman. The special effects at that time were exceptionally good (and probably too scary for children under 7 at the time - but I rank this movie for kids 8+ not children 7 or under.I mean, I saw 10 year olds at the remake of The Texas Chain Saw Masacre a few years ago, so now, 'Monster Squad' would be lukewarm to them.) If I had an 8 year old, we'd be watching this together just like I watched Universal's Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, The Invisible Man with my parents and/or siblings. (Granted I did see other horror films alone, but you can't beat them all!) Heck, these films are in my DNA, I know it would be in my child's.This is quite the underrated 'kids' monster movie.",The Monster Squad
58,one9eighty,Kicking Wolfman in the Goonies,7,23 July 2018,"I grew up in the 80's and watched this as a child, it was fun and entertaining, and it worked with my imagination which was already leaning towards a tendency for horror. As a thirtysomething year old now, I've re-watched the movie, and I still got some enjoyment out of it, along with a bucket load of nostalgia. Van Helsing and his gang break into Castle Dracula and use a spell to stop a reign of evil by destroying an amulet. Something goes wrong and evil is not wiped out, instead the good guys lose, but evil ends up lying dormant for a while. Fast forward to the 80's and things are about to get ugly. While transporting Dracula's coffin to America, Dracula manages to escape, after which he calls on some of his most trusted henchmen - I mean, monsters. Arise then: Wolfman, Creature from the Lagoon (or Merman), The Mummy, and Frankenstein's monster. Set on destroying the vehicle which would allow them to be banished - the spell and an amulet. Luckily there is a Monster Squad in town, a group of friends who love monster movies, monster facts and trivia, and, well, anything monster related. The Monster Squad manage to work out what is happening. Along the way they slowly convince some adults to help out. The ultimate aim, is to succeed where Van Helsing failed, and put a final end to evil - stopping Dracula and his hench-monsters. Think ""The Goonies"" with a lot less money for the budget, mixed with ""Stand by me"" with more horror, and ""Fright Night"" but with the lights on. This is a fun adventure with all the charm of an 80's cheese tasting session. It's harmless, family fun which a touch of horror. The monsters are camp, the bats are rubber, the soundtrack is synth-tastic, there are tongue in cheek Easter eggs all over, it's cute, it's sad - it's a lot all rolled into one. I'm not saying it's the best kids horror film you will ever see, but definitely not the worst, but it's definitely fun. I'm expecting this to get re-booted at some point, as there is a lot you could do with CGI to amp-up the film, and because in its day, this got a cult following of fans. 7 out of 10.",The Monster Squad
59,phubbs,The Monster Squad,8,14 January 2014,"Bunch of savvy kids that have their own secret club, a neat treehouse base and end up on a spooky adventure trying to stop supernatural forces...you could say this has a 'Goonie' influence. Hell the young boys even have a fat kid amongst their ranks and he wears loud brightly coloured shirts too.The plot is hammy as hell but it is suppose to be a homage and twist on the classic B-movie horror genre and of course Universal horror monsters. Putting all the big name supernatural beings together and sticking them in the 80's (present day back then). All the classic monsters including Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Gill-man, the Wolf Man and The Mummy teaming up to try and take over the world with a supernatural amulet, only the kids can stop them. The only way they can be stopped is to open a portal into limbo and kick them through...this whole idea visually looks identical to the portal sequences in the 'Evil Dead' franchise.So the whole thing is really cheesy and silly as it is suppose to be a kids flick, but it is??. There is actually some quite edgy scenes in the film with visible blood and body parts! when Wolf Man gets blown into pieces for example, nothing much hidden. Some scenes are also a bit scary for the younger viewer in my opinion. Again Wolf Man attacking people and transforming in classic 'American Werewolf' style, stakes through various hearts with blood, Dracula trying to actually kill the kids and the makeup doesn't skimp with realism. The monsters all look as they should in classic style but they certainly aren't tame by any means. Wolf Man has a much wilder vicious look which is pretty scary, Gill-man is the best if you ask me, he looks terrific, whilst Frankie is as expected as is The Mummy. Its only Dracula who doesn't really thrill, the casting seems a bit off to me, the guy in the role just doesn't look right, he's too young and 'modern' looking if you get me. There are also Dracula's vampiresses who look as you would expect but they have no purpose in the film, kinda under used idea really, clearly crammed in.Naturally there are plot issues a plenty which don't really matter but they do stick out. Why exactly does Dracula have Frankie in the first place?. Where did Dracula get that big black slick custom hearse?? he's only been in the US about one day! and how did he get a hold of that big mansion? is it his??. The most obvious to me was why exactly Gill-man, The Wolf Man and The Mummy all joined Dracula in the first place, they all just appeared and teamed up. So before hand what exactly did Gill- man do? he just like...lived in the swamp? how did he and The Mummy know Dracula had arrived in the region? I'm guessing it was his supernatural powers. None of the monsters have any real backstory, it all just happens.The silliest of all was in the finale when Van Helsing appears from the portal to drag Dracula through it. But if Helsing was in limbo how did he get out to do that? and wouldn't he wanna try and stay in the real world once getting out?! I'm pretty sure it wasn't easy.Its certainly a strange beast this film, its hardly for kids with the blood, monsters and Dracula going around snapping cops necks, yet it is aimed at kids with the young 'Goonie-esque' line up. The young cast are good but the whole time you can't help but think they really wanted Corey Feldman, Haim and Astin in the main roles. Pretty much cast everyone from 'The Goonies' in this and while you're at it call it Goonies 2. End of the day the film was just an excuse to bring back all the classic B-movie monsters and have them looking top dollar with modern makeup (for the time of course). And it works plain and simple, the plot is daft with many holes but it doesn't really matter, its a flick for ghoulish monster lovers with a touch of Indy adventure for good measure.8/10",The Monster Squad

I suspect many people rating this highly are kids, or are fueled by nostalgia having seen it as kids. I don't know if I'd like The Goonies or The Lost Boys as much had I not seen them as a kid; this movie is similar in spirit to both, more to the former.Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, The Wolfman, The Mummy, and The Creature from the Black Lagoon (Gillman) show up in a suburban neighborhood, where Dracula is trying to locate something that will let evil triumph over good. Dracula is the main baddie here. The Mummy and Gill-Man don't get much to do; this mummy is a particularly feeble one, anyway. The Wolfman is good in his human form, and Frankenstein's monster has a tendency towards good as well. The Invisible Man doesn't appear in either form.A group of kids who are fans of monster movies discover that monsters have actually shown up, and they decide to try to save the town from the monsters.

Rightly earns itself a cult status for Stan Winston & Co reimagining the Universal Monsters but the terrible story still can't be redeemed by amazing SFX.

At the same time, we would know it wasn't just a harmless romp.The costumes were wonderful, the characters were credible, and unusually for a 1980's movie, the adults weren't stupid. They helped, but the children were the ones who were able to save the day. I loved the clever moments, such as when Dracula was burned by a slice of garlic pizza, and the touching moments when the girl gave her doll to the Frankenstein monster to remember her by.But true evil was not avoided, not only by the fact that the ""scary German"" was a man who had suffered the Nazi era, but how policemen had to face real dangers such as bullets and bombs from the monsters.

Inspired in part by the ""The Little Rascals"", ""The Goonies"" (this film and that Richard Donner movie obviously giving rise to Abram's ""Super 8"") and the all-time champion Universal classics. This movie is pure awesomeness, headed by Fred Dekker and with special effects by none other than Stan Winston (the man behind ""Jurassic Park"" and other legends, enough said). If you, like me, saw Stephen Sommer's ""Van Helsing"" and felt your favorite monsters had been turned into CGI monstrosities, then this is for you.Every monster is somewhat updated, but for the most part they retain their classic features. The make-up and animatronics are done quite awesomely. Duncan Regehr is so great as Dracula (""Meeting adjourned"".BOOM!!) and Tom Noonan is just fantastic as Frankenstein's Monster. The 'Gill Man' and the Mummy look pretty bad-ass as well. Enhancing these beasts are great sets and a spectacular score by Bruce Broughton.Andrew Gower, Ryan Lambert, Stephen Macht, Leonardo Cimino are all very good in their simple but very enjoyable characters. Brent Chalem will always be remembered as Horace, R.I.P.The tone of the film is odd but that's what makes it so memorable. I can see why at the time of its release why audiences may have been put off by the movie. After all, plenty of swearing, strong content, but the leads are children. Who exactly was the target audience? The dialogue is snazzy, the comedy well-staged and yet these characters feel very real to us. That's really where the audience is; anyone who is willing to embrace the characters really. And no worry, all along there is some excellent carnage. After all, if nothing else, the film answers the age old question if a silver bullet really is the only way to kill a werewolf.Loads of fun and a classic that's for damned sure.

65,loganx-2,If I Had A Juicebox For Every Time I Watched This,10,12 June 2008,"This isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it did manage to completely capture my childhood mind. Dracula, The Wolf-Man, Frankenstien, The Mummy, and a swamp creature (ala Creature From The Black Lagoon), all converge on a small suburban town some time in the 80's. Dracula is attempting to bring about the end of the world(never mind why or how), and it involves Frankenstien, the stroke of midnight, and a magical amulet. Thankfully some junior high kids find a book by Van Hlelsing, and since they already have a horror themed monster club, they decide they are best suited to save the town. Bieng a boy who watched an inappropriate amount of horror films for his age, I ate this film up, devoured the frames repeatedly for years, and though I am clearly biased, I think a lot of it still holds up very well. I can't imagine a time when ""Wolfman's got nards!"", or ""...they call me...(shotgun cocking sound)...Horace!"", wouldn't bring an easy smile to my face. All and all it's an imaginative and witty little children's horror film, from the director of ""Night Of The Creeps"" a hilariously bad 80's throwback to 50's drive in zombie/alien movies. Anyway, it's good kids adventure stuff, with a little more sex/violence than your average children's film (or maybe it's just 80's children's film's in general, Artex dying in NeverEnding Story, etc), but still fairly acceptable for all ages.

What is undeniable is that a script written like this will never appear in another movie for older children. The modern political correct nature of our world would squash this movie in a heartbeat, which makes this film more unique. There is an abundance of crude humor yet very funny that actually depicts kids being kids. Also a typical imagination of children and their idea of monsters such as Dracula, Wolfman, Gillman and Frankenstein's monster coming to life in their reality makes for a great movie.

⚪
All in all, this pop culture classic marvellously assembles a bunch of horror nerds and pits them with five of the iconic Universal monster, and what sounds like a cheap answer to the question what would happen if you let ""The Goonies"" clash with ""The Avengers"" of monsters, is an ambitious small production with a lot of heart, love for detail and a feeling for creating horror fun for the whole family, and even if is undeniably cheesy and the short runtime causes it to be unbalanced and rushed, it is the ultimate nerd fantasy that every horror enthusiast should have seen at least once.

The movie for day sixteen is another one of those films I have seen ages ago and loved back in the day. Now that I have the chance to borrow this awesome mediabook edition from my Dad, I finally had the chance to revisit it, and oh yes, it was one hell of an experience again. When I was fifteen, this film was a gift from God, simply because I knew that feeling the protagonists have. My teenage years were the time I intensively dealt with horror films, and especially the classic monsters. To see five of them assemble in a Marvel's ""The Avengers"" type of group was a highlight of my movie watching adventure. Now that five years have gone by? Well, even if I this time noticed some minor narrative flaws, I still felt this extreme childlike joy. Co-written by Shane Black, the man responsible for ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Last Action Hero"", the film delivers the perfect fan service for every horror fan out there. I mean, Dracula assembles his friends The Wolfman, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Mummy and Frankenstein's monster to once and for all rule over the earth? How cool is that?! And then there is the group of friends, all of them die-hard horror fans (like us), who use their knowledge to stop them. What can possibly go wrong with this? Well, all excitement aside, the film is sadly unbalanced and doesn't make use of its full potential. Aside from the criminally short runtime, the only monster in focus is Dracula. Of course, Wolfman, Frank, Mummy and Creature are there too, but especially the last two are totally underused and function as mindless henchmen for the blood-sucking count. Also, and I am aware it is a film targeted for families; I still think it could have been at least slightly more brutal. I mean, the werewolf explodes into thousand pieces in one scene, so why didn't the monsters cause more chaos? Furthermore, I had the strange feeling that some members of the titular club weren't as properly introduced as others and hence it was difficult to emphasize with them. But aside from this, it is a classic late eighties fan fest that does what you have always wanted to see. Performances shouldn't be evaluated here. Just the fun it caused me to have. Oh, and am I the only one who thinks that the little girl Phoebe is the true MVP of the whole story? Well, if not her, the best aspect of the film is probably the famous Nazi reference in the beginning. It is as brilliant as it is chilling, and it is small details such as this that make this film what it is. It is far from perfect. Frankly, it doesn't want to be. It just wants to bring you nostalgia and be the ultimate horror nerd fantasy. In this point, it is a masterpiece.",The Monster Squad

When fiction becomes fact and Dracula descends on their home-turf with a few buddies in tow, it's up to the kids to save not only themselves, but the future of mankind as well.Co-written by Shane Black (""Lethal Weapon"") much of the film's energy comes from the hilarious dialog given to the child actors, who come across as not only likable, but believable as well. In a genre where child actors are usually maligned, it's quite a relief to find a cast so young that can carry a movie so well. It's surprising, then that none of the children went on to have budding careers (save for Jason Hervey who went on to TV's The Wonder Years"").Dekker, who serves as both director and co-writer, gives his film a fun, feel-good vibe, that makes the film more family friendly than the average genre film, but not at the expense of the audience's enjoyment.

76,RhapsodyReviews,Great Film From My Childhood.,8,24 October 2019,"Review:
'The Monster Squad' is a comedy-horror film directed by Fred Dekker.
This is one of the all-time best family-horror films you can see. When I was in school, I use to watch this movie all the time. I blame this one single movie for my great taste in cheesy, violent horror movies I've grown into as an adult.
The film follows a group of high school kids that believe they are all experts in monster knowledge. When their clubhouse leader Sean (Andre Gower) finds out a group on monsters being led by Dracula (Duncan Regehr) himself has invaded their town, he brings the group together to talk about how to stop them before it's too late.
I only really knew Tom Noonan who played Frankenstein from other films in this movie. I was surprised with how well the acting hold up through the years. I wish Andre Gower and Robby Kiger did more stuff after this but didn't really fully pursue their careers in acting. I enjoyed everybody in this movie, but I really appreciated the studio getting good child actors since they're in the bulk of the film.
The whole movie is entertaining from start to finish, and I love the fact that it's a monster movie that is still considered to be family friendly. It never loses what it wants to be and gives good scares while also having a bit of humor in the mix.
Overall, the movie could be loved by all, but I also think not as lot of people know this movie even exists. Go check it out and you won't be disappointed.

My favorite of the group is Sean as I was a lot like that when I was younger, followed by Rudy since he's so cool, even dispatching 2 monsters, and finally Horace who overcomes his fear to even dispatch a monster of his own as well. I even like how Frankenstein sides with the kids and befriends Sean's sister Phoebe, not unlike how Chunk befriended Sloth in the Goonies.

The Goonies changed that in 1985 and there was never a film quite as good, that was until 1987 when horror cult legend Fred Dekker (Night of the Creeps) brought us a movie that was more adult, yet knew that wasn't going to stop every kid seeing it without too much effort.Enter one of the most awesome films of my childhood; The Monster Squad! With all the classic prosthetic effects, comedy and blood and guts explosions synonymous with 1980's horror legends, Fred Dekker told a tale of an unlikely band of guardians standing against the forces of darkness; a bunch of kids barely into junior high (as far as I can tell, being English).The son of a cop, Sean, and his tree-house gang are faced with Dracula, the Mummy, Wolfman, Manphibian and others when an ancient artifact is lost in their suburban town. Dracula needs it in order to complete his quest for dominance over humanity, but when Sean's baby sister accidentally brings home Frankenstein's Monster (played brilliantly by rent-a-psycho Tom Noonan of Manhunter, Robocop 2 etc) and he turns out to be friendly, this turns the tide in their favour.Just when you think this is some silly kids fantasy played out for nobody but the kids however, the action amps up a few notches and we're not spared from some seriously enjoyable monster carnage the way it's supposed to happen.With some hilarious one-liners (WOLFMAN'S GOT NARDS?), it escalates to the point where you really miss kids being able to use bad language in films. Let's not beat around the bush here. Film and television is ignorant to the fact that most insults and swearwords today are invented by kids before they enter the mainstream.Monster Squad recognised that and with all of this good fun happening all around, and with kids kicking serious ass with crossbows, shotguns and even sticks of dynamite for crying' out loud, this movie is still today some of the best fun you can have with a kids movie.It's so politically incorrect that it couldn't be more accurate!

So when Dracula shows up in town with a host of supernatural nasties including Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man, they are of course the ones who are best suited to battling these forces of evil and sending them back to where they belong.This is one of those movies that was made about kids, for kids, but which isn't really suitable for kids. It's basically a bunch of little kids running around swearing and making jokes about farting (not that there's anything wrong with that), and it's just begging for cult status. The silliness of the humour offsets the inherent silliness of the storyline, which doesn't even try to make sense. The script is fairly strong, having been co-written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, Last Action Hero) who at one point was the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood, and with Stan Winston doing the special effects, where can you go wrong?

Of course their family don't believe them until they see things for themselves. It a fun short adventure that's perfect for young teenagers who haven't see these type of older B-movie flicks. A good rental for Holloween along with Monster House. You don't see too many horror comedies with kids anymore. Instead we get movies like Shaun of the Dead, Eight Legged Freaks or Scary Movie. So check this one out. give this movie a 7/10 rating.",The Monster Squad

I used to make my parents rent it over and over again... the 80s were very different... peeping toms, smoking (by minors or by their cop dads blowing it in their faces...), a plot that doesn't really make sense (it doesn't have to), Pepsi, leather jacket bad boy character trope, unsupervised children, montages... Yep. That's how I grew up. Do kids even have tree houses anymore?This movie is funny. It also has some great Stan Winston reimaginings of all the classic Universal monsters. Enjoy it.

88,Kingkitsch,"""Creature stole my Twinkie""",7,1 March 2015,"""The Monster Squad"" is fondly remembered by many, especially guys like myself who actually were part of ""monster clubs"" in the 60s. Fueled by the release of classic Universal horror films of the 30s to television at the time, and the ubiquitous Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine as well as the arrival of the great Aurora Plastics ""long box"" monster models....there were monster clubs nationwide. One suspects that director Fred Dekker was influenced by all this horrormania when choosing to helm TMS in 1987.TMS hasn't aged particularly well. A recent viewing after first seeing this in a theater on it's original release reveals a number of problems with the film as a whole. TMS can never seem to decide exactly what it's going for. Horror? Comedy? Adults? Kids? For every silly moment and laugh, there's genuine unpleasantness. Characters are easily disposed of and instantly forgotten, such as the cop who gets blown up by Dracula. One minute he's spouting one liners and the next he's killed in a fairly grim fashion. No other character reacts to this in any fashion. The three vampire mistresses show up in classic Universal style, but are so obviously tacked on to the climax to provide the resident ""badass"" kid with a couple of kill shots we forget about them immediately. Only two are shown killed, so what happened to the third? The monsters, lovingly re-imagined by the late makeup genius Stan Winston, are so easily destroyed that we don't really care about them. They're simply there to be killed by a gang of kids, Scooby-Doo style. Only these kids use real weapons instead of their wits. Easier to shoot the Creature (known here as Gillman) and call it a day.TMS appears to have been heavily edited since the ""extras"" on the new DVD release show a number of scenes that were cut. The simple plot of TMS could have used some of the deleted scenes to help fill the many, many plot holes in the final version of the film. What remains to be viewed really does play out like a cartoon. Heavily Un-PC in places (mostly some gay slurs hurled by resident mega-jerk actor Jason Hervey) firmly root TMS in the awesome 80s. Two things to look for here though, the startling reveal of Dracula as half-man and half-bat lying on the floor, and the jaw-dropping ""head lift"" of the little sister by Dracula, calling the tyke a ""bitch"".The real hero of this monster mash is Eugene. He's little, has a dog named Pete, and no one, except for the US Army pays any attention to his encounters with the monsters. He has a couple of the movie's best lines, including the great ""creature stole my Twinkie"". In any event, TMS is still worth a viewing, decent effects for the time in which it was made and the natural inclination to see this homage to the Universal monsters as a low-budget rip-off of ""The Goonies"". A good Halloween treat for adults who want to share a few thrills with their kids without excess amounts of violence and bloodshed. Despite the flaws, TMS still invokes that shuddery frisson in those who remember the good old days.",The Monster Squad
89,jgusw,This movie is GREAT!,8,5 November 2000,Monster Squad is a cool movie.  This is a great movie to watch with your kids on Halloween or for a sleep over.  This movie is about some neat kids and some cool monsters.  It's not scary and it will keep your child's attention.  Great movie.,The Monster Squad
90,kimheniadis,"I dig it, man!",9,15 January 2016,"I was just a bit younger than the kids in this movie when it first came out, and I probably watched it a dozen times. But I haven't seen it since the late 80's. So my first thought with any movie from the 80's is, does it still hold up? And this one, in my mind, does without a doubt. It has all the cheesy goodness one would want, with a low body count, that one would expect of a PG-13 movie in the 80's.Being a kid who loved horror movies, this situation was a dream for me. I lived out in the country so the closest neighbor with kids my age was two miles down the road. Needless to say, I didn't have any friends nearby that I could have formed a Monster Squad with. The parts that I remembered after all these years were when Phoebe first met Frankenstein's monster, and when she was playing dress up with him. I imagine those struck such a chord with me because as a young girl I would have loved to have done this.Some of the things I noticed that I am sure I didn't even stop to think about for a second as a kid were at the beginning when a female vampire is sucking a possum dry, and I think there was an armadillo running around in the scene. I just really thought these were strange animals to choose. And when I was looking over the credits, Charly Morgan comes up as Vampire Bride with possum.The fake bats hanging from the ceiling and bouncing around were adorable. And Ryan Lambert, who played Rudy, reminded me a lot of Corey Feldman, who as a kid, I also thought was adorable.Now for the things that I wouldn't have even thought about when I was younger, but really stuck out to me as an adult, were how many times at the beginning they used the derogatory slur for gay men. Also Horace was called Fat Kid, even by his friends. In this day and age with bullying being such a hot topic, if you watch this with your kids, you just keep it in mind when you watch it.A few other things were an open flame by Phoebe's bed. Her mom had put it there telling her as long as it burned, the monsters would stay away. Open flame next to the bed, not the best idea, but hey, we survived that and a lot worse in the 80's. Also, the black police officer, and I think he was the only black person in the movie, got killed by TNT. It made me think about Scream 2 where Jada Pickett Smith remarks about the black characters always getting killed.In the 80's I remember divorce being a big topic. Sean, the leader of the Monster Squad, had parents who were going to marriage therapy and were on the verge of divorce. But after slaying monsters together (His dad's a police officer, and the mom sees the monsters towards the end) it looks like they will be one big happy family. In regards to if you should watch this movies, as their principal says, ""I dig it, man!""",The Monster Squad
91,keesha45,Great fun for preteens and those who remember Universal monster flicks,6,19 February 2007,"It seems that Fred Dekker (ROBOCOP 3 writer-director) and Shane Black (LETHAL WEAPON creator) trotted out everyone from the classic horror film vaults except the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, and the Notre Dame Hunchback for this romp through the fright genre intended for family viewing. While it's a long way from being a good film, it has some well-done scenes and obviously it was well-liked by many of the previous user commentators. Stan Winston's work in the creature designs was very effective, but the special effects were not up to the same level. Even many of the original movies featuring these characters were not exactly noteworthy for outstanding acting and writing, but they entertained audiences with some memorable screen characters and some of them here, particularly the Wolfman and Gillman, came out quite well. Even some of the juvenile actors performed well enough to make the film interesting for younger viewers and for those of us old enough to remember the great old horror films and later takeoff works like the ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET... series.

92,TYLERdurden74,Cult Movies 39,7,9 November 1998,"39. THE MOSTER SQUAD (horror-comedy, 1987) Dracula travels to 20th century America in hopes of retrieving a mystical amulet stolen from him 100 years earlier by long time nemesis Van Helsing. Within the amulet the forces of evil rage and whomsoever wields it can set them loose. Dracula seeks the help of other mythical creatures: the Wolfman, the Mummy, the 'creature from the Black Lagoon', and the indomitable Frankenstein monster. Just when their victory seems assured a group of young teens, dubbing themselves 'the Monster Squad', step in to thwart their nefarious plans.Critique: For lovers of those old monster movies from the 30s and 50s this is a treat to watch. The real 'star' of the film is make-up and special effects wizard Stan Winston (creator of 'The Terminator', 'Predator', and 'Aliens' creatures, to name a few). With an amazing eye for detail he has been able to capture the monster's legendary traits, and individual demeanor to perfection. They're really wonderful creations (not too corny or too scary) that hark back to their previous incarnations with a touch of the modern. Though the film borrows heavily from others such as 'The Goonies' and 'Gremlins', and its intended kid audience may be too young for some scenes, it's still a fun movie with the works.QUOTE: ""We just went through some major s*** and where's the big limbo thing.""",The Monster Squad

Ok, so it was a lot cheesier than I remembered, but it's still great fun.  Monster Squad has some great dialogue and really entertaining scenes.

(heck, the poster says ""you know who to call for ghosts, but who do you call when you got monsters?"") The story of the film is pretty simple, you have a group of kids verying in ages (much like Goonies) who are obsessed with Monsters. They come to learn that REAL monsters are in their time and after them because one of the kids has Van Helsing's diary, and the means to destroy all the monsters, hence the Monster Squad is born. What saves this film is that it has good casting, good laughs, and excellent creature effects. (The Creature from the Black Lagoon looks awesome for 1987 standards). All the monsters are basically 'more' realistic versions of all the Universal classics, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Wolf Man, The Mummy, and as mentioned Creature from the Black Lagoon. Excellent nostalgia, only wish there was a widescreen DVD available...oh well, I'm sure it's gonna be out soon enough.

98,jefffisher65-708-541158,group of kids take on Dracula and other classic monsters,8,7 July 2013,"For years, well, ever since it was released, The Monster Squad has generally been treated as something of a joke among most serious monster movie fans. I didn't see it until some years later, but can't help wondering why this little film gets dumped on so much? Sure, most 1980s kids were fans of slasher-type horror, but the notion of some being into the monsters from the classic era is not a bad idea. Having them save the day in the end is a nice touch as well, though granted, this movie isn't going to be a contender for one of th best such ever made.The story is more or less a reworking of the Universal monster rallies of the 1940s with the kids in the Monster Sqaud opposing the creatures; it does not take itself too seriously in doing so, and I feel it has just the right mix of humor and some creepy moments as well. The Gill-Man and mummy don't get a lot to do unfortunately, but Tom Noonan's portrayal of a friendly Frankenstein monster is a plus. Dracula and the Wolfman are suitable ferocious(although the wolf man unwillingly so).I think fans of 1980s cinema would like this little movie better than what many of them seem to I would add.All in all, a nice family film/monster picture with some nice revisions of several classic film monsters.",The Monster Squad

Cause compared to movie like return of the living dead , evil dead, frankenstein 1931, invisible man 1931 and so on this movie looks much much more on easier side.*Plot.First of all its veeery short and it wants show several things, compared to frankenstein 1931 when there was less things to show for the same time. Because of time problem, there was no time for character development - they just appear with minimal characteristics, well except frenky. If i was more invested to know them like in ex. ""stand by me"" than i would appreciate them more., while swamp thing was the best, tho it was second easiest to kill monster after pathetic mummy, tho i loved the look too. 3 vamp brides were cool looking tho slower than zombies. And btw Dracula + car + dynamite + no sun damage (scene from the plane)? *Actors. They are good enough, ""there are some cheese on a side dish"" mainly because of their one-liners, some are great (werewolf nards) and some are repetitive and unfunny (there's mummy in my closet). Werewolf looked lifeless in its final form compared to swamp thing, which could escape being more still cause he was a fish.

120,blankistoblank,Fun Horror For All Ages,7,17 December 2018,I have seen this movie at least 50 times over the course of my life. The monsters are cast perfectly and the makeup for each is top notch. Dracula has to be one of the most memorable incantations of all time in this film. Go watxh this movie if you havent.,The Monster Squad
121,zodreb,Exactly why is this movie bad?,2,18 July 2007,"I'm not gonna say this movie suck because it's stupid and has bad acting or whatever. Fact is, this movie could have been great. The actors were cute, the monsters looked incredible, and the effects were fine for the time. It's 80s camp, it's monsters, it's kids kicking crotches - all that is awesome.The sole thing that brings this movie down is how choppy and incoherent it is. It seems like there is a story (which actually seems to be a cool story for an 80s kids/monster film as far as I could tell) but only the writers knew it well, and as a result it's edited in a way that if you knew the story and characters it would make sense, but to anybody in the audience it's hard to identify with the characters or feel with them or even follow the story well at all. I very much wanted to like the movie simply due to its 80s charm. I love that kind of stuff, really I do. But the story is so badly structured you can't enjoy the movie.Characters join the Monster Squad for no reason. Bad guys do things with little or no setup. Characters seem to have knowledge of things happening that they shouldn't have. People have odd motivations and strange reactions to events. All this could have been corrected with good editing, both writing and film editing.The characters were lovable but that was destroyed by the bad film structure. Ruining lovable characters and monsters like those kids is simply a travesty.At the same time, the movie seems incredibly confused as to whether it's for young kids or old kids. Lots of swearing and other ""big kid"" things (over 13 please), but lots of characters in elementary and grade school.I love 80s kids adventure movies. This is not a good one. At the end I felt cheated because not only was it a bad movie, but it was a bad movie that definitely could have been totally rad 80s awesome. Nostalgia nothing, even as a kid it's not memorable simply because you couldn't get close to the characters because of the bad way it was edited/written.This is saved from one star because of the potentially cool characters and the 80s-ness of it.",The Monster Squad
122,fitzyboy,A classic movie for the whole family!,10,31 October 2018,I loved this movie when I was a kid and I still do. Its just a down right fun movie to watch on a Halloween night with the whole family. Anyone who thinks otherwise is taking it way too seriously and is obviously missing the point. I mean who didn't have their own monster squad when they were a kid?,The Monster Squad
123,Axesbowledaslove,Why the dismal ratings?,10,6 July 2001,"Give this movie a chance.Imagine ""The Goonies"" without the budget but with all the heart. The Monster Squad is a pack of grade-schoolers with an ear to the rail on the evil doings of monsters. No, they haven't seen any monsters-- but that doesn't mean they don't exist.You guessed right. Turns out there are monsters running around all over the place, and they are fixing to put the mortal screws to Portland, Oregon. Lucky for us there are a few heros, mostly fifth or sixth graders and a beagle pup, who will act instead of sitting around worrying about their marriages like some stupid adults we know.The Monster Squad is one of these rare movies that treats kids, the problems they face, and their unique solutions to the same with grace, wit -- and solid respect. This superbly sweet and memorable movie deserves more than the 5.5 it got here at IMDB.Great scene: Leonardo Cimino plays the film's Boo Radley, the strange recluse whom all the kids fear without knowing why. When Sean, the leader of the Monster Squad, is given a book that can illuminate why the monsters are reappearing, he has no choice but to seek the man's help. The book, it turns out, is in German. Not only does the scary man speak the language, and kindly help them get through the important passages in the book; it also happens that he knows what monsters are.You might need to explain to your kids what the numbers tattooed on the scary mans forearm are.",The Monster Squad
124,halo01,Monster Squad delivers!!!!!!,10,24 June 2002,"This is another really great movie that came out in the 80's.  If you are a horror buff, you will love all the monsters in this one.  I can't wait for this one to be available on DVD.  This movie is one of my favorite all-time movies.  Do yourself a favor and go out and rent this one!!",The Monster Squad

I am really surprised this only has 6,000 votes. I am glad it came to DVD after 20 years also. Just waiting on the Blu-Ray if possible.As a youngster seeing this for the first time, I was terrified of this movie, but now it is just plain fun and still love it after 20 years.You have to see this movie if you loved movies like The Goonies, The Midnight Hour and any other 80s Horror Comedy.Jon Gries (The Rundown, Napoleon Dynamite) also plays the Wolfman which is a bonus. He is a great actor. Tom Noonan stars as Frankenstein.10/10",The Monster Squad
126,borimor,Cult movie but one big mess,4,22 October 2016,"Not doubt, that this a movie have the tag ""cult movie"" all over is forehead; the strange plot, the wink to classic horror characters/movies & the box-office failure. For me, it's bad cult movie, just like many films before. The movie is one big mess, for example, it's hard to understand the motives and the actions of the heroes - The Monster Squad - many time it's not make sense. The same villain can be very weak and very strong at the same time, and like the heroes, you didn't understand their decision making. Also it's a child movie or adult movie? I never seen such a confusing movie, there's violence, sexual comments and bad language, but the plot and the characters are childish. Some people will enjoy the movie, and the producer choose few good decision, for instance, shorten the movie to less than 90 min. I think, the movie have a potential for sequel, with new cast. In conclusion, it's not the The Goonies.4/10",The Monster Squad

128,cardel1,"Good mixture of comedy and Classic Horror characters - Dracula, Frankenstein and others.",8,15 November 2005,"I was 26 when I first watched this movie while babysitting my nephew. We both had a lot of fun and every now and then we reminisce about it. It's just the kind of movie I really enjoy as it blends horror and comedy. You have your good guys and bad guys with some of them saving the day and it should appeal to the younger kids because of how brave the characters are. What kid wouldn't want to save the world! It's not scary,(it may be for the younger children) but if you enjoy movies like Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein, Young Frankenstein and Love at First Bite among others, than you'll have a good time. I really hope it finds it's way to DVD so I can buy a few copies to give as gifts to some of the younger kids for them to enjoy as my nephew and I did. I want a copy for myself and if you're young at heart, you'll want one too!",The Monster Squad
129,llscheppink,Quite good,8,24 January 2005,"One of the newer 'classic' horror flicks. All the famous monsters (Dracula, the wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, the mummy and the Creature from the Black Lagoon) meet in a small town in an effort to open the gates to hell. A group of young monster hunters attempt to stop them, and receive help from some... unexpected allies. The movie was great to watch and it's a shame it isn't available on DVD. The monsters are done quite nicely and the humour is well-balanced and quite fun. Certainly something worth viewing. The only apparent flaw, is that the character of Van Helsing is mentioned to be German, which - of course - he isn't.Worth 8/10",The Monster Squad
130,Mister-Rational,Monster killing at it's best!,10,2 August 2005,"This has to be the greatest kiddy-horror movie of all time! I remember watching it when I was in first grade and thinking it was the scariest film I'd ever seen. Now I'm twenty yrs old and I just rented it again; and it's pretty scary (ex:Wolfman in ambulance). Anyway, for those of you who haven't seen it; the movie is about a group of twelve year old boys, obsessed with monsters and end up forming a club called the Monster Squad. But unknown to them, Dracula is real and has come to their town in search of a talisman that can open the gates of hell. So to aid him in his search, he recruits the horror world's most feared villains: The Wolfman, The Mummy, Frankenstein, The Three Sisters, The Creature from the Black Lagoon (Gillman). Now granted, if you haven't seen this movie, it made sound like the rest of the movie crap from the 80's, BUT IT'S NOT! Even Dracula...who is in the cheesy Black cape with red inside outfit, is very scary; especially when he's ripping apart cops. All and all, the movie was done very well considering the outrageous plot and the action is very solid.QUOTE: Sister: Mom says you have to let me in or it's ""Prescription""Shawn:It's ""discrimination"" Prescriptions are for drugs; which you're on if you think you're getting in here!",The Monster Squad
131,Good_Bad_And_DeadDude,One of the best movies ever!,10,23 April 2007,"Well, I think everyone's seen this movie by now but just in case, I'll ""warn"" you that this might have ""spoilers"". First off, I am someone you might want to trust with a review of this film because in 1987, I was about the same age as the kids were when this movie was shot (not to mention the fact that I was also in the age group that this film was geared to, as well). With that said, what teenager grows up in America anymore without being exposed to monsters in various forms? And what better film to watch as a kid (or with your kids) than a film where a bunch of kids fight with legendary monsters such as Dracula, Wolf-man, and Frankenstein's Monster? I mean, aren't there times when you want to kick someone in the 'nards just like when Fat-Kid land a perfect kick square in the Wolf-man's nether-region? Or at times, don't you feel like just opening a hole in ""limbo"" so you can be rid of evil just like Pheobe did? I know a slight drawback is that the special effects seem a little crude when compared with today's big budgeted CGI-filled schlock (but actually for the '80s they were some of the best effects I ever saw), but the one reason above all that this is and always will be one of the best movies ever made is that good overcomes evil in the end, even if a bunch of kids have to take charge!",The Monster Squad
132,Teek,Great!!!,10,6 February 1999,"Along with The Pirate Movie, The Goonies, and Labyrinth, this is one of my favorite movies. It is a great movie for kids and parents, and it is a classic for monster movie lovers. The acting is not for the Acadimy Awards, but the story line, script, and makeup were excellent. I enjoyed this move, and have watched it many times. I would recommend this for anyone!!!!!!!!!",The Monster Squad

The way the young cast interacts with each other with great one-liners, respectable fx and superb sense of coolness secreting from the screen.. You are (or I am) attracted to how the film has used its influences very well as to monsters.

It will always remind me of times that were MUCH simpler.",The Monster Squad
136,Cinema-Queen,Scooby Doo eat your heart out,8,13 June 2011,I loved this movie as a kid. Back then they had very few movies with younger teens as main characters especially in horror films. If you liked Super 8 u should also like this film. Its a dark suspense film for kids:) The kids were great actors and the story was very cool. If you ever wanted to see a film about the point of view of kids when a disaster like monsters from the past coming to the present then this is your movie. Don't expect a lot of computer special effects like their are today to be in the film but it does have a lot of good theatrical effects as well as great make-up. The movie is a classic for the time period when it comes to kids horror films. Enjoy!!,The Monster Squad
137,bounty_hunter_inc,A Great Time for Young and Old,10,29 October 2004,"Monster Squad is one of my favorite childhood movies. I'm so glad that I finally found it on DVD. It is about a small town that is the battleground for a team of monsters: Dracula, Frankenstein, Gill Man (Creature from the Black Lagoon, NOT the Loch Ness Monster), Wolfman, and the Mummy. There are other vampires in the movie too. The monsters in the movie are very well done, but not too scary, since it is targeted for much the same audience as the Goonies. (There are a few scenes though that are rather graphic). The only thing standing in the way of the monsters are a group of monster-obsessed kids called the Monster Squad.I still love this movie. I thought it was very good. I'm very surprised it's not more well known than it is.",The Monster Squad

139,DemonGate,I'm in the goddamn club aren't I?,7,12 April 2006,"Ahh, yes...the eighties, I remember it well. The flamboyant outfits, the far out hairstyles, David Lee Roth embarking on a solo career...who could forget? It was indeed a most singular and unique decade (one that some of us older folks try hard to forget.) Yeah, okay...I wore the slashed black jeans with the Judas Priest logo stitched onto the front pocket...but let's not go CRAZY because I did, it was all the rage back then. As far as eighties MOVIES go, I think that one in particular stands out above all others of it's type. Although, I must admit with shame that I had forgotten all about it. Then, one night, whilst taking part in a cinema trivia game the following question was asked of me, ""What eighties movie featured a bunch of kids battling against Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy and Frankenstein?"" It was at this point that it all came flooding back, ""Oh yeah, that's right"" I yelled excitedly, ""The Monster Squad!"" Who could forget those six determined teens duking it out with Gill Man and those three vampire vixens in the middle of town square? I mean...seriously, those kids were in way over their heads. But...as luck, a 5 year old virgin and a script with a happy ending would have it...they prevailed. Woo hoo! The Monster Squad is secretly filed away in the 'guilty pleasure' section of my mind...and even though it emphatically raises the question, ""What age group is this aimed at?"" I shall enjoy it for many more years to come. What a movie! Bravo Mr. Dekker...bravo! By the way...whatever happened to Ryan Lambert anyway?",The Monster Squad

And although ""Hollywood"" may advertise alot of movies with the tagline "" Fun For the Whole Family"". This actually delivers on all fronts. It's a great homage to the universal monsters.

141,Jonny-Utah,classic from the best kid movie era!,9,12 May 2006,"What a great era the 80's were for kid flicks, in particular for comedy, adventure and action(not violence). First we were given Ghostbusters(the film that introduced me to the wonderful world of cinema), then The Goonies(awesome)and, just when we thought the kid flick had vanished The Monster Squad came along a couple of years later. This film had all the vital ingredients in abundance of the genre i.e far fetched make believe plot premise, great monsters etc. But the thing that makes this movie really is the child actors themselves. Each one performs with comic perfection and its a wonder, and shame that none of them really went onto big things in their acting professions.The film has certain charms that isn't seen in todays blockbusting celluloid mainly due to the invention and progression in CGI. While this film relies mainly on great costumes and make-up for the monsters, i believe this actually works in bringing out the performance in an actor(today actors are usually talking or reacting to something invisible) or in this case the kids in this flick. Excellent.",The Monster Squad
142,freewillgeek,Cult classic monsterpiece!!,10,12 May 2004,"What's not to love about this great flick?! It's got humor and great moments with the classic monsters, rendered in styles much more in keeping with the Universal tradition than the slick ""Van Helsing"" (which I do like).
The kids are great, the monsters look good, and the jokes are actually funny. WHEN will this film be released on DVD?! It deserves the special edition treatment.I've seen this film so many times, first as a youth when it was released, and it never gets boring.It's campy without being stupid, and tongue-in-cheek antics abound. Anyone notice the odd way that this film and ""Evil Dead 2"" seem to have shared similar endings? It's kind of strange, really.ANYWAY, would love to see this released as a nice DVD.",The Monster Squad

This film is in the same kind of league as The Goonies for happy childhood memories, but I need to see it in all its wide-screen glory. All the classic Universal monsters are here, rendered with great affection and panache by Richard Edlund and his team. The special effects are outstanding for a 'kids' film, and that's what makes it such a hanger-on in Monster Squad devotees memories. It doesn't try to hold itself back and schmalz all over us, it just plays it for scares and laughs, and in my opinion, what more do you need?!Finally, I have to reiterate my previous comment. DVD!

It isn't the type of movie to get boring after you have watched it so many times. The actors fit their characters perfectly, they couldn't have picked anyone better to fit the roles. Especially the characters of Dracula and Frankenstein. Also, I definitely have to mention the incredible special effects and costumes. For example; the various transformations between the monsters and their ""human forms.""

Shane Black (Lethal Weaponfilms , Predator films), Stan Winston(Terminator films, Predator films) and Peter Hyams(2010, Running Scared). The film was enjoyable though the script could have used more polishing. While this film starred kids, the kids in focus were basically teens and the film could have played a bit more seriously. Andre Gower had a great screen presence. The rest of the cast was good to but the cutesy little sister thing should have been eliminated or toned down. It made the film feel as though it was unsure if it wanted to be a horror film or a campy kiddy flick. There were scenes that were clearly not meant for a 7 year old viewer. I think the film should have played itself more seriously. Still it was a fun film.

I was skeptical during the first few minutes because without recognizing any actors I figured that it must be made in a foreign country.

162,kornchip4202002,where is this movie!,10,27 September 2004,"i remember this movie even though i was 20 yrs old at the time being one of my favorites and it cannot be found anywhere if anyone knows if it is going to be re-released let me know i would to have this in my collection it is fun and funny especially ""Dracs"" interaction with the little girl at the end with one of my favorites quotes from a movie ""Give me the amulet you..."" and how the monsters where brought back from death by Dracula. I have asked several places and was told it is out of print. Hope that is not true because there are so many good films out there that have somehow been lost between the cracks and never heard form again maybe that is not so of this movie.",The Monster Squad

164,jordanfrank609,Great movie for families to watch,7,2 May 2014,"Not the typical horror film. The Monster Squad was a live action horror movie that came out in the summer of 1987. The movie is based upon this group of middle school aged boys that are obsessed with monsters. Dracula is alive and plans on taking over the world and seeking help from the other monsters. And whose there to stop them, a group of kids that are considered as loser to their classmates that are here to uncover what the monsters plans are to attack the forces of evil. Will Sean and the rest of the group save the world? This is a good film for families to watch. Instead of there being a bunch of gory killing scenes like there is in the Halloween movies or A Nightmare on Elm Street and other slasher movies from the 1980s; there is more comedy and a little crude behavior in the movie. Since I was five at the time and the movie was PG-13 my mom thought it was OK for me to watch it. At first I didn't like the movie since every time Dracula came on I would freak out a bit like most young children would, then as I got older and watched it the more I love the movie and the way they delivered the plot and the characters really well. You're probably thinking if there aren't characters like Freddy Kruger or Michael Myers like in the other movies in the decade. There was Dracula, Frankenstein, a werewolf, a mummy, and the Gill man. The costuming for the monsters made them look a little scary, but now looking at them today they look a little bit corny at least with Frankenstein, Dracula, and Gill Man looked a little too made up and fake. The only one that looked more real was the mummy from the wrapping to the skull head and the way that he walked too. I think that it's a good horror movie to start out with because it's not like most horror movies that there is a lot or death scenes and that there isn't a big male or female adult lead like most other movie. The heroes the children that are barely in middle school. The plot is easy to follow. The special effect were good for the time, since the movie was made in 1987 it was probably the best special effects that they had 26 years ago, compared to today if people see it, it would be more corny and more friendly for a young audience. It also follows some of the popular stories that the main monster character. I think that there is also a message in the movie as well. When Frankenstein came into the movie Dracula had him locked up in room and telling him what to do. Then when he met that kids at first they were scared of him but in the end they all liked him. What Frankenstein wanted was someone to be his friend instead of having people fear him like they do in other stories, since he was made by a human.",The Monster Squad
165,parkyscron,Brilliant time travel back to the 80's,10,5 January 2021,This film is absolutely brilliant. I just watched it with my 5 yr old and 8 yr old and they absolutely loved it. I'd totally forgotten about this little gem and would encourage anyone who loves the Goonies to see this 'B' movie version.,The Monster Squad
166,ajsnyder-06261,A lovely family movie night,8,23 September 2017,This movie was a lovely way to spend my Saturday night I enjoyed it from the begging. With slim references to Stephan King and Van Helsing this movie had a lot of great parts. Now the actors were amazing and the monsters look amazing for this movie to have been released when it was. I do believe this movie has not been given its proper dues as a horror movie for the whole family. I highly recommend this movie to any person who loves to have a good night with the family.,The Monster Squad
167,shamus-6,"Highly underrated, and sadly forgotten",8,16 November 2006,"I loved this movie. It was no Goonies...but the goonies had some serious names attached to guide it along. Who doesn't love the classic monsters? And this movie brings them all together!!! It was geared for kids. My biggest compaint is that Dracula (as a bat) is able to be exposed to sunlight. Other than that, I'm impressed that the creators tried to follow the traditional guidelines. The older sister is also SMOKIN hot. Would love to know what she's up to...However, there was enough swearing and impressive effects (for the times) that it could appeal to older teens and adults as well. I truly wish this movie had been bigger, so as to warrant a proper DVD edition.Thanks to makers of this film, and all of its young and talented stars!!!",The Monster Squad
168,squrlly360,great movie!!!!!,8,8 January 2007,"This movie is a great movie and will stand the test of time.They should put this movie out on DVD asap.the makeup was awesome for what they did with all of the characters,great storyline.In this movie they had some of the best werewolf makeup that i have ever seen worn by a live actor(and i have seen a lot of horror movies)in the movies.I have been watching this movie since i was a kid and it will never get old.The creature from the black lagoon is sweet!And for those true fans out there the guy from the wonder years was funny as hell when he came face two face with the monsters.This movie will take anyone back to when they were a kid and scared of monsters. everyone should be made to watch this movie at least once in there lives.and in closing I would just like to say that it is ""BOGUS"" that it is not out on DVD yet.Tank you.",The Monster Squad
169,profcdavid,A Scooby Doo Adventure But with More Substance and Heart,5,4 August 2019,"Fans of the classic Universal Films monster movies will appreciate how well the roster of iconic movie monsters are portrayed, staying true to the spirit of the original B & W films, which go as far back as the 1930s.One scene is a nearly identical recreation of the controversial scene where the Frankenstein monster encounters the little girl by the lake. And the shadowy bat scenes are just cheesy enough to remind us of the primitive special effects of the old Dracula movies.This is essentially a kids movie, but with enough humor and clever dialog to keep the adults engaged. The monster makeup/costumes and related SFX are well done and worthy of the monster movie genre.And we walk away with new knowledge about the wolfman. Not only can he be subdued with a silver bullet, but he can also be brought down with a swift kick in the nards. Keep that in mind the next time you're taking a moonlight walk.",The Monster Squad
