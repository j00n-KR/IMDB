0,SnoopyStyle,a fair copy,7,11 November 2018,"Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière (Charlie Hunnam) is a thief in 1931 Paris. He is framed for murder and sent to the French Guiana penal colony. He partners with weakling counterfeiter Louis Dega (Rami Malek) and attempts various escapes using Louis' money.Papillon (73) is one of my favorite prison movies of all time. This is a fair redo and that's all this could be. The production is top level. The setting has the tropical desperation. It falls on the two leads to rise to the challenge. Rami Malek has plenty of Dega in him and the comparison to Dustin Hoffman is not unfavorable. Charlie Hunnam tries his best but he's no Steve McQueen. Few are and it's an unfair ask. This is fine but it doesn't compare to the original.",Papillon
1,nogodnomasters,It's the story of a lot of men,7,3 October 2018,"They did a remake of the incredible story of Henri Charriere Papillon. Why? I don't know. It was clearly not as good as the first one which may have had some Hollywood dramatization. This film appeared to be more gritty and realistic but knowing the ending made it anti-climatic. Not a bad production, just not as good. Guide: F-word. Brief sex. Nudity.",Papillon
2,kosmasp,Reasons why,7,14 February 2021,"And no I don't mean to have reasons why or want to have any for this remake. No I mean the reasoning behind the will of our main character. He is getting more of a backstory here, than he got in the original movie. Now this may satisfy some and may make some really angry or annoyed. But it is there and I would argue it is not a bad thing overall.Charlie Hunnam still has to leave his Sons of Anarchy shadow behind ... he is trying very hard and he may succeed one day. But as of now he has not done anything remotely as succesful as SoA. Not trying to be mean or discredit him as an actor in any way shape or form. There are quite a few reasons I reckon why he wasn't able to. But he's working and he's doing a lot of big budget movies, so there's that.This is not a carbon copy of the original, which may satisfy or anger the fans of the original. I liked its approach and the changes it did overall. Still the classic movie triumphs over this. Which doesn't make this a bad movie at all. It's a very fine movie actually. If you like dramas and slow moving stories. The (free) will of humans does not have to be explained ...",Papillon
3,ma-cortes,Biography about Henry Charriere who suffered various periods of solitary confinement in French Guiana,7,2 February 2019,"This is the story of the unrelenting Papillon , Charlie Hunnam , the French prisoner sent in the thirties to the horrendous and impenetrable prison establishment in French Guiana from which his attempts to getaway lead him with various periods at solitary imprisonment and including the impregnable Devil Island .

4,CinemaSerf,Don't try to compare it - it's good in it's own right.,7,21 March 2021,"Ordinarily, I would be very sceptical about a remake of such a groundbreaking film, but Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek acquit themselves well in Michael Noer's adaptation of Henri Charrrière's novels. Hunnam is the eponymous character, fitted up for a murder, and sent to a French penal colony in South America. En route, he is befriended by wealthy but weedy extortionist ""Dega"" (Malek) who offers him funds in return for protection. A shrewd move, as it turns out - for many of the prisoners had a habit of swallowing their money before their deportation trip, and those with knives knew exactly how to retrieve it - before nature had had a chance to take it's course! On arrival, they discover a regime that is brutal and their lives a daily nightmare of malnutrition, violence and deprivation. What now ensues is a depiction of their fight for survival, gradual bonding and even their brave escape attempts which frequently only serve to make matters even worse, and their locations even more hostile. Handsome Hunnam is not exactly the most versatile of actors, but he gets behind his part with enthusiasm; Malek portrays the musteline forger convincingly as does Yorick van Wageningen as the Warden ""Barrot"". The cinematography is gorgeous, the attention to the detail of costumes and settings top notch and the way in which their debased existence is brought to the screen is professional and enthralling. Maybe just a bit on the long side - it periodically sags a little, but there is an element of chemistry between the leading men that renders this a worthy remake of the McQueen/Hoffman outing from 1973.",Papillon
5,zardoz-13,A Good Remake That Imitates the Original,8,24 November 2018,"Some movies shouldn't be remade. An example is director Michael Noer's ""Papillon,"" about the real-life experiences of a French safecracker named Henri Charrière, who penned the eponymous autobiography of his nightmarish incarnation in French Guinea in the early 1930s. Noer's film benefits from a sturdy cast headed by ""Sins of Anarchy"" star Charlie Hunnam as the lead. He was framed for the murder of a pimp and shipped off to the penal colony on the other side of the world in South America. During the voyage, Charrière befriends a wealthy forger, Louis Dega (Rami Malik of ""Need for Speed""), who becomes fast friends with Charrière. Charrière needed somebody with money so he could launch escape attempts, while Dega needed the protection that the brawny Charrière could provide. Inevitably, these two grew to be inseparable. The conditions of the prisons that they were confined at were abysmal. Few inmates escaped, much less survived, in a land filled with treacherous predators on land and sea. Nevertheless, these myriad dangers did not stop Charrière from embarking on one escape attempt after another, until he got off Devil's Island and lived the live of a free man. Hunnam and Malik make a believable, often charismatic pair. ""Contraband"" scenarist Aaron Guzikowski drew from the original screenplay of the Steve McQueen & Dustin Hoffman film which was scripted by Dalton Trumbo of ""Spartacus"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" scribe Lorenzo Semple Jr. Indeed, if you've seen the far superior original, you will know exactly what to expect from this movie. Although it draws heavily from its source, the remake qualifies as a good, often exciting thriller, with Hunnam's thoroughly convincing performance. Unfortunately, as admirable as it is as a remake, this ""Papillon"" doesn't have the raw power of director Franklin J. Schaffner's movie. This picturesque production, featuring scenic locations that replicate the subhuman conditions of the prison with its corrupt guards, heartless wardens, and bestial inmates comes in second best. If you enjoy the remake, the original will blow you away.",Papillon
6,ferguson-6,a gentler remake,6,23 August 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It seems like most every remake that comes around begs the question, ""Why?"" This is especially true when the film being remade is a favorite such as 1973's PAPILLON. The original was directed by Oscar winner Franklin J. Schaffner (PATTON, THE PLANET OF THE APES, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL), and starred two legendary actors, Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr, and was based on the Henri Carriere books ""Papillon"" and ""Banco"". Mr. Carriere was, of course, the titular Papillon himself, and though the specifics of his stories have been met with skepticism over the years, he nonetheless delivered some fascinating material.So why make the film again 45 years later? Well this is a kinder, gentler version and features two of today's most popular actors: Charlie Hunnam (""Sons of Anarchy"") and Rami Malek (""Mr. Robot"") as Papillon and Louis Dega, respectively. The screenplay from Aaron Guzikowski (PRISONERS) focuses more on the friendship and less on the brutal prison environment. Director Michael Noer (I'm admittedly unfamiliar with his previous work) delivers a movie that looks very good and works as an example of loyalty and bonding.The film opens in 1931 Paris and we witness Papillon (so known because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest) doing what he does ... safecracking for a powerful mobster. He seems to be living the good life with his girlfriend (played by Eve Hewson, Bono's daughter) and they have plans to escape this life of crime - always an ominous sign in movies. Sure enough, he is framed for murder and sent to the penal colony in French Guiana. It's there that he meets Louis Dega (Malek), a master counterfeiter. Dega is a soft and slight man, and the wad of cash hidden in his nether-regions puts a target squarely on his back. So Papillon's brawn and need for cash to grease the wheels of his escape, and Dega's need for protection, make this the match made in heaven (or in this case, hell). Being a man of eternal optimism, Papillon never loses faith that he will escape, even when the warden (a terrific Vorick van Wageningen from Fincher's THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) explains that hope is his enemy. The years spent in solitary confinement rob Papillon of years and weight, but never hope. A final stint on Devil's Island reunites the two men who share a bond that only such harsh circumstances could build. Since we know that Henri Carriere wrote the manuscripts for the books in 1969, the ending is known before we start; however it's the telling of the story that allows us to come to know both Papillon and Dega.This latest script does a better job of developing the friendship, as well as providing Papi's past and reason to live. The original nailed a man's commitment to surviving, while this one makes hope more of a philosophy. Lacking the magic of McQueen, Mr. Noer's version doesn't quite compare, but for those who have never seen the 1973 film, this one should prove quite engaging - even if we old-timers don't buy into the kinder/gentler approach.",Papillon
7,phd_travel,The new version is more gut wrenching,6,2 September 2018,"Well made as could possibly be, you may wonder if it's worth watching if you liked the first one with Dustin Hoffman. As can be expected for a recent movie it's very in your face and realistic. The acting is very good from both Hunnam and Malek. The story is captivating from the beginning - even though you know the outcome you still want to see it to the end and the great escape. Because it's so realistically made it's quite depressing and gut wrenching.Worth a watch if you can stomach it.",Papillon
8,gradyharp,A film that induces the sense of solitary confinement,6,13 June 2020,"Henri ""Papiilon"" Charrière's 1969 autobiography hits the screen once again, this time written by Aaron Guzikowski and directed by Michael Noer, and while the acting is fine - Charlie Hunnam as wrongfully accused victim of a murder charge Papillon and Rami Malik as the counterfeiter Louis Dega - the film is thuddingly long.While much of the film is brutal and realistic while depicting attempted escapes and the aura of prison, the important message of the value of friendship between Papillon and Dega does ring clearly. Far too much of the film focuses on the solitary confinement Papillon 'earns' from his escape attempts - a 2 year sentence then another five year sentence - and the dank and dark silent atmospheres results in audience participation: watching these passages is akin to actually being in solitary confinement!The previous 1973 version of the true story - with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman - moved more rapidly and was far better paced. Hunnam and Malek (and an assorted ensemble cast) definitely create the mood of the book, but the direction and editing are sluggish. The resulting concern for the audience is simply hoping that the next escape attempt works - to end the film.",Papillon
9,Hellmant,"I enjoyed parts of it, including the visuals and score.",8,31 August 2018,"'PAPILLON': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biographical crime-drama about a French convict that escaped from a penal colony in 1943, with the help of another convict. It's a remake of the 1973 classic (starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman), and it's based on the autobiographies by Henry Charrière. This updated version stars Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek. It was directed by Michael Noer, and it was scripted by Aaron Guzikowski. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and my feelings on it are a bit mixed as well. I enjoyed parts of it, including the visuals and score, but I think it goes on for way too long, and it's far too slow-paced. With a little better pacing, and about 20 minutes more cut out of it, the movie could have been much better.",Papillon
10,FeastMode,my notes,2,27 July 2019,"Super boring and pointless. please stop making historical based-on-true-story movies. it's pretty messed up that this happened, still not worth a movie (1 viewing)",Papillon
11,westsideschl,Better Than I Thought It Would Be,9,20 November 2018,"I preferred this version slightly over the '73 version although it too was great. Reasons why I preferred this was in the acting (newer slightly w/Malek & Hunnam over the prestigious McQueen & Hoffman); the locations (newest: Serbia, Malta, Montenegro over the older Hawaii, Jamaica, Spain) & definitely sets, props, costumes in the newer.
Supposedly, Papillon the tale is at best 75% true with a large part being an aggregate of other inmates experiences. According to French records he was not imprisoned on Devil's Island which incidentally has nice slopping beaches; not cliffs. What was surprising to me was that this small boat made it via wind/currents from French Guiana along hundreds of miles of Atlantic ocean to the northern tip of S.A. & Colombia, and not ending up in mid-Atlantic. Supposedly Charrière ""Papillon"" (butterfly in french of which he carried a tattoo) tried several times to escape in his 11+ years of incarceration (imprisoned in 1933 released in 1945); spent most of his subsequent life in Venezuela; book published in 1969; died in 1973.",Papillon
12,ops-52535,expected more...,6,24 October 2018,"I grew up with the book story and original film about papillon, and im sad to say,i was abit dissapointed. its not the acting,it good enough considering the premisses.
its the choice of locations, very cheap boat scenes, and the storytelling. all prisoners werre taken to the jungle on the mainland when arriving guyana,doesn show in the film, the isle are low terrained with a sloping coastline in the film its high cliffs and hills,they have mixed the nun and the indians by whom he was betrayed by and spent a year with.dega never met the indians!!!!!. very impotrant part of the book ! the lepra prisoner did not mingle with healthy prisoners or laymen, they had their own island on a river deep in the guyana jungle. akso when handling the boat,its clearly visible that there are return waves or echo waves around the boat, which tells me that the shooting has been done near a large quay or landing or in a wave pool. and where are all the socalled sharks everybody talks about---did you see a shark?????
there are too many actuall and historical flaws to make this a classic...",Papillon
13,Thanos_Alfie,Very good...,7,6 March 2021,"""Papillon"" is a Biography - Crime movie in which we watch a wrongfully convicted man creating a friendship with a fellow inmate. They face many difficulties while they are prisoners and they have to overcome them. After sometime they both going to Devil's Island from where they want desperately to escape.I liked this movie because of the plot that was based on true events and the direction which was made by Michael Noer. Since I had already watched the original movie of 1973 I knew what I was about to watch so, I focused mainly on the interpretations of the cast which I found very good especially of Charlie Hunnam who played as Henri Charrière (Papillon) and Rami Malek who played as Louis Dega. If I had to choose between this movie and the original I would choose the original because it was more emotional than this one. Finally, I have to say that ""Papillon"" is a nice movie and I recommend everyone to watch it especially those who have not watched the original yet.",Papillon
14,cruise01,Dull direction but good performances.,6,7 November 2018,"Papillon (3 out of 5 stars).Papillon is a gritty, grim, and strong biographical drama film about Henri (Papillon) played by Charlie Hunnam being imprisoned on a notorious devil's island in 1933. The film does get grim seeing these prisoners being starved, beaten, and put into a breaking point until they are insane. It does get a little graphic with prisoners harassing the weak. Guards and wardens trying to break the prisoners.The plot was decent feeling a little dull at times. Besides it is based on a true story of Henri Charriere actual memoir of the events he encountered with being beaten, trying to protect another prisoner, and escaping. And getting captured to be placed on devil's island. Henri is a skilled thief. A safecracker. Working for the criminal organization. When he is wanting out and gets framed for murder. He is sent to devils island for life. He meets a counterfeiter Louis (Rami Malek) who is rich. And has some money with him that can buy his protection. Henri and Louis try to plot their escape on a broken down boat. But gets captured again and placed in a confined room for years until they are back on the island. Which nearly looked every prisoner is broken down, feeling hopeless, and losing their minds from starvation, isolation, ect.Charlie Hunnam was decent with playing Henri. Rami Malek was good playing Louis. The emotions with these characters as Henri and Louis looking out towards the sea for freedom was sad and heartening.I did not like the beginning of the movie with Henri being that slick safecracker. And walking to a club in France. Every thing seemed a bit rushed with the first 15 minutes of the movie. He is working for some mobster in breaking through safes. He gets drunk and falls in love with one of the clubs dancers. And they walk around the city of France having a good time and messing around like teenagers. And Henri wakes up in a hotel room until they get interrupted with the police arresting him for murder. The beginning felt rushed and cheesy. It does get better from there.Overall, Papillon is a fair drama film. Plot was okay. Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek gave a good performance. The gritty tone was emotional and powerful. Even if the movie had a cheesy rushed beginning.",Papillon
15,eddie_baggins,"Watchable, but the original is still the best",6,12 May 2019,"There's no real reason for 1973's Papillon to have been remade, a sentiment that was seemingly found in most people considering how little fanfare this update got upon initial release, coming and going without so much of hint of notice but Michael Noer's re-imagining of the classic Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman prison break drama is a solid, if unremarkable attempt to breathe new life into the supposedly true life tale of 1930's convict and escape artist Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière.Starring two of the most in-demand actors working today, in the form of Sons of Anarchy superstar Charlie Hunnam (who just can't catch a cinematic break) and Bohemian Rhapsody star, new Bond villain and Oscar winner Rami Malek, Papillon is a picturesque and solidly filmed epic that's lack of heart and energy often holds it back from achieving its goal of justifying its existence around its much beloved predecessor, that to this day holds up well as one of the quintessential incarceration/escape film's.There's a lot of commitment on show from its leads, with Hunnam and Malek diving headfirst into their roles, even if Hunnam is the films real MVP, stripping back (and off) for his role as con artist turned wrongly convicted murderer Charrière.While Malek is fine as psychically weak forger Louis Dega, of whom Charrière begins to protect in hopes he can finance an escape off the notorious French/Polynesian that the two criminals find themselves on in the harsh surrounds of the early 1930's, Hunnam's psychically and emotionally charged turn is deserving of a better film, a shame since his strong performance here will remain largely unnoticed, much like the similar low-key release of the very good Lost City of Z.Despite Hunnam's turn and some great production qualities on stunning surrounds filmed across Eurpope, Papillon's big missed opportunity is in its creation of a strong friendship between Charrière and Dega. We never feel a strong connection between these two men, there's hints of a bond throughout but never a fully-fledged connection.Unlike say a classic such as The Shawshank Redemption or even the original 1973 film, of which featured a great double act of comradery between McQueen and Hoffman, Papillon never nails its central and important friendship down, meaning we're always kept at arm's length to the plight of these two very different men, unable to be more than curiously engaged rather than totally captured by their dangerous undertakings.Final Say -Unnecessary and not close to matching the original, this modern take on the Papillon story is still perfectly watchable and features a turn by Charlie Hunnam that showcases why he can hopefully have a break out feature but overall you do wonder what the point of this whole exercise was when what we've had before is still more than adequate.3 bundles of coconuts out of 5",Papillon
16,Tweetienator,Okay,6,23 November 2018,"I read the original book by Henri Charrière a few times and I watched the movie with the titans Dustin Hoffman and Steven McQueen a few times.
As I suspect that the story in the book is not all ""true"" and the movie from 1973 made some significant changes to the story told in the book, the book is good and interesting reading material and the movie is a well executed movie with not only a good production but really great acting.So why make this remake!? The actors cannot compete with the aforementioned titans, and all in all the remake just feels a little redundant and is more or less a rather solid but not outstanding experience compared to the book and the old movie.My recommendation: read the book, than watch the movie from 1973, and if you have still some more spare time and nothing else to do, you may watch and try this one too.",Papillon
17,arfdawg-1,Stop with the Remakes Already,5,2 December 2018,"When Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman made ""Papillon"" in 1973, they were at the top of their game and money was put into the production.Unfortunately these two actors are not compelling at all. In fact the guy in the Hoffman role pales by comparison.Coupled with an unbearably slow exposition, the film is tedious to watch. It's films more like a TV movie or something on Netflix that a film that is theatrically released.The net net is a movie where you ask the question, why?",Papillon
18,stevendbeard,How Much Can A Man Endure?,7,26 August 2018,"I saw ""Papillon"", starring Charlie Hunnam-King Arthur:Legend of the Sword, Sons of Anarchy_tv; Rami Malek-Mr. Robot_tv, the Night at the Museum movies; Eve Hewson-Bridge of Spies, Blood Ties and Roland Moller-Skyscraper, Atomic Blonde.
This is a remake of the 1973 Steve McQueen & Dustin Hoffman movie of the same name. Both films are based on an autobiographical book written by Henri 'Papillon' Charriere and it was also a true story. Charlie plays Papillon-which means butterfly, a nickname he had because of a tattoo he had-who was a well known safe cracker in 1930's Paris. Eve plays his girlfriend. Charlie is wrongly accused of murder and sent to prison in French Guiana. There, he meets and befriends Rami, a professional counterfeiter. The warden is very strict, saying any escape attempts will earn time in solitary confinement and when he says time, we are talking in years. If any guards are killed during an escape, you automatically earn a date with the guillotine. Of course, Charlie thinks about nothing but escaping and makes a deal with Rami to protect him in prison, in exchange for footing the bill on any escape plans-you know, bribing people or any materials needed. Roland plays a fellow prisoner that wants in on the escape. After several failed attempts at escaping, the warden starts to lose his patience and sends the boys to a different, more escape proof prison called Devil's Island Prison. It is an interesting look at how much a person can tolerate and endure and I heard that Charlie lost 40 pounds while filming the movie.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes.
I would probably buy it on DVD.",Papillon
19,CubsandCulture,Effective Retelling,8,6 January 2019,I haven't seen the original in years but the new version held my interest and a few of the scenes really stand out. In particular the nude shower fight scene is one of the more striking fight scenes I have seen this year. There is just something about it that really has both main characters vulnerable and raw. The first solitary sequence was also highly effective.I don't think there is really much that this version brought to the table outside of being a bit more brutal. It is worth seeing for the two lead performances through. The relationship felt a lot closer and more emotion here than in the original. I wish I saw this in the theater.,Papillon
20,henry8-3,Papillon,5,23 September 2019,Huffman and Malek are framed murderer and millionaire fraudster respectively sent to serve a long sentence on the deeply unpleasant penal colony on French Guyana.This is an enjoyable enough 'true' story that became a best selling novel and both the leads and indeed the set pieces are well enough handled. It is difficult though not to compare it to the 1973 original (many scenes and indeed the script are copied word for word) where the scale of the project was grander and the leads frankly better. A good effort though - worth catching.,Papillon
21,jimbo-53-186511,"The intentions are admirable, but the film itself is a little clunky and slow-paced",5,8 August 2020,"When professional safe-cracker Henri Charriere (Charlie Hunnam) is wrongfully convicted for murder he forms an unlikely bond with wealthy convicted counterfeiter Louis Dega (Rami Malek). When Henri learns of Louis' wealth he offers to protect Louis on the proviso that Louis finances Henri's escape plan...It's about 5 years ago since I watched the original Papillon so my memories of it are somewhat vague. However, this 2017 version does seem to be vastly different; in some ways that is a good thing as I found that this remake did seem to explore the darker underbelly of the prison which did give the film a hard-hitting sense of realism which in some ways does make the film linger in your mind. The film is a brutal and tough watch, but it does give you an idea of the hellish conditions that the prisoners were subjected to.So clearly there is some good with this film, but at the same time I found that whilst it gave with one hand it also took away with the other. I found the set-up to the escape incredibly long-winded, some scenes went on for too long presumably merely for dramatic effect and I think that the director went overboard with some of the violence/torture - yes necessary to an extent, but at times it was a little over the top. Although the relationship between Dega and Charriere was fairly well-explored, the relationship was a fairly cold one and I struggled to buy into this deep friendship that they supposed had here (it came across much more believably in the original).In the lead role, Charlie Hunnam was brilliant and has proven himself to be a capable and reliable actor over the years. I was less impressed with Rami Malek and felt that Dustin Hoffman brought more to the role in the original film. Technically, the film is good with some beautiful photography and cinematography (moreso when they get to Devil's Island).I don't totally hate this film and did appreciate the different approach that was used. It was arguably deeper and a little more expansive than the original film, but if I just want to watch something deep and expansive I'd watch a documentary. It's purely a matter of taste, but to me this film felt a little cold, clinical and uncinematic. If you haven't seen the original film I would suggest you check it out as whilst it is different in some respects to this film I did it enjoy it slightly more than this one.",Papillon
22,kluseba,Unnecessary,5,5 September 2018,"There is no question that the original Papillon movie released almost forty-five years ago and starring star actors Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman is an amazing historical period drama and survival adventure movie. Based upon true events, it tells the story of a wrongfully convincted prisoner who tries to escape a French penal colony in French Guiana on three occasions. One has to question why such a movie would be remade in the first place. Even by today's standard, the original film's acting performances are very skilled, the exotic locations are breathtaking and the story about freedom and friendship is profound and timeless. Even though the remake isn't a terrible film, it's completely unnecessary. If you're not familiar with the topic, I would suggest watching the original film. I would even suggest reading Henri Charrière's Papillon and Banco novels which inspired both films. I would even recommend watching a documentary about French penal colonies before watching this remake. Watching this film should be your last option. However, it still remains an option, simply because the story is so good that it deserves to be watched or read or heard.A remake should have the ambition to offer a different take on the events of the original movie and to improve it. There are very few of these elements to be found in this film. If compared to the original film, this remake shows us roughly fifteen minutes of the lead character's life before his wrongful conviction. We can see him cracking a safe, attending a party with members of an organized crime gang and spending time with his girlfriend. This exposition also shows a reason why Papillon would be framed for a murder he didn't commit. He kept some of the diamonds he stole for the gang to offer them to his girlfriend and was seen in the process of doing just that.One element where the remake nearly matches the original film's quality is the acting. If compared to the unique Steve McQueen and the diversified Dustin Hoffman, Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek are obviously less experienced but they might deliver the best performances of their careers. Their friendship feels stronger and makes even more sense than in the original film. Charlie Hunnam convinces as resilient man who never gives up on his dream of freedom and comes surprisingly close to Steve McQueen's charismatic performance. Rami Malked does a solid job as scared intellectual and has great chemistry with Charlie Hunnam but can't match Dustin Hoffman's natural talent.On all other levels, the remake is quite a letdown. The new version is about twenty minutes shorter than the original film but ironically feels much longer than the film released forty-five years ago that already had a few lengths. The events leading to the first escape attempt are stretched and the scenes in solitary confinement are played brilliantly but end up being quite repetitive. On the other side, important scenes have been cut or excluded in the remake. The men's haunting passage at a leper colony was completely cut from the remake. Papillon's life with a native tribe lasts for about five minutes in the remake even though he lived there for a long period of time, got married to two sisters and even impregnated them. The ending is quite abrupt in the remake as the director shows a brief scene of Papillon's return to France decades after his final escape without telling what happened in nearly three decades between both events, making the remake feel less concise and focused than the original film that ended with Papillon's succesful escape.One element I would have liked to be mentioned is the fact that Henri Charrière's story was at least partially made up. He clearly wasn't as innocent and sympathetic as portrayed in the movie. Making his character a little bit more sinister would have been an intriguing addition if compared to the rather neutral original film. However, Papillon instead seems to be an even friendlier lead character than in the original film which is somewhat misplaced but goes along with typical Hollywood productions that fabricate heroic protagonists the audience wants to cheer for. In this case, this approach is too simplistic.In the end, there are very few reasons to watch this remake. The exposition adds some depth to the lead character and the acting performances exceeded my expectations. However, the movie has more lengths than the original film, important scenes have been cut and the resolution feels misplaced. At the end of the day, this remake was quite unnecessary.",Papillon
23,adamjohns-42575,"""Cheer Up Charlie!""",7,16 March 2021,"I know that some might give me grief for my opinion, but as a child of the 80's I found this version of the story much more accessible than its predecessor.
I know it's easy to say that, because film budgets and special effects are so much better and bigger these days, but the Steve McQueen version, whilst also excellent, was darker and grittier. Perhaps by making it easier in the eye, the more polished, cleaner and newer version takes away some of what made the original. That grit shows us the horrors he endured and the darkness takes us on the journey with him. I certainly prefer films that aren't so grimey or nasty that they upset my gut. You know the ones where you can smell what's in he bucket or the rancid food and feel the cold or the burning heat. I like films that I can access and understand without having to try too hard, which this take on it allows me to do.The story, before anything else is even considered, is pretty good to begin with. There will be die hard McQueen fans that will call this interpretation an abomination and refuse to watch it again and there will be other fans of the original that consider that as long as the tale is told, it doesn't matter who's telling it. I think it stands on its own either way as a great tale, but I was disappointed to read that a lot of it may have been a fabrication, or at the very least, a collection of stories rather than one specific autobiography, which the film alludes to at the very end.When I think about the leads, I have to say that Charlie Hunnam wins me over, but that's because I would love to get him hog tied on a table too. There are moments where it doesn't seem like he's been through the trauma his character is supposed to have endured, especially towards the end when he is more like the teenage Nathan from 'Queer As Folk' again and not a tired, beaten, middle aged man as he should be. That said, his acting abilities have come a long way and I think he does a great job here, if a bit more heroic than Steve's version and that isn't quite right.
If I'm honest with myself, Steve is the better Papillon, he just doesn't float my boat like Charlie.Rami in the role of Degas is probably very good, but there was something about him that put me off. I think I was so impressed with Dustin Hoffman when I saw his performance, that it would always be difficult to compete with that.The supporting cast do a fine job, there is no one else that specifically stands out, but that in itself shows a consistently produced film.I personally find this one to have a better pace and to be more bearable to watch.
I do, however, have a grumble. I don't understand why, in this age of such superb acting abilities, versatility and international co-operation, the correct accents aren't used? They are French after all? It doesn't have to be spoken in the French language necessarily, but an accent at least would help to set the scene appropriately. For all I knew he could have been from America or England.It will go on my list of films at a higher rating than the original, but that is my personal taste. I don't deny that both are very good.",Papillon

Both actors played Dega at the height of their powers. Charlie Hunnam is perfect as Henri Charriere, as good as Steve McQueen, although I'd say no-one could really pip Steve McQueen for sheer cheek and presence.

Except by cruel happenstance he is fingered as a murderer by a mobster gang lord and sentenced to life imprisonment at the most notorious facility they have to offer... Devil's Island. A compound prison camp nestled in thick green foliage with nothing but ocean as the moat for Papillon and his friend Dega who both vie to escape the hellish conditions of the sadistic guards as well as deviant prisoners from all walks of life. It is a told account of their trials and obstacles to overcome their mental and physical instabilities so that the opportunity will show itself in the form of a boat, or a clear running path to freedom. I found this to be an excellent portrayal where the director used exact dimensions to the prison itself. What you saw was how they lived day to day in constant fear of being both killed or raped or even executed. Charlie Hunham played Papillon brilliantly as did Rami Malek who acted as Dega, The cast was picked perfectly and the movie was directed like it should have been with all the trimmings included to show us just how bad the prison really was by testimony accounts and parolees. Birds or Butterflies are not meant for such brutal establishments such as Devil's Island. Although human mistakes can often be made Papillon allowed us to witness the darkness that law makers thought was normal for all criminals during the height of criminal activity. The music score was flawless as was the complex location backdrop of French Guiana to authenticate this film's most potent emotion... Hope.Being stuck within an apocalyptic prison for nearly twelve years mentally taxes a human to their bursting points and for Charriere it was his moment when he attained freedom.

47,kaptenvideo-89875,Unbelievable true prison escape story!,6,14 October 2018,"First, there was a true story of hope, endurance and daring escape from a tough prison in French Guayana in 1941.Then came the controversial autobiography by the man who lived through it. Then we had a celebrated 1973's movie... and now there's a remake.The original movie's stars Steve McQueen (the epitome of cool in 1960-70's Hollywood) of and Dustin Hoffman have been replaced by Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek which is surely an interesting choice.Hunnam is in amazing physical shape but also a promising actor - a combo you don't see often -, while everybody likes Malek in ""Mr. Robot"" who's suitably nerdy counterpart for the other man's buffed-up torso.Turns out, the new ""Papillon"" is much more action- and looking-cool-centered than the brainy original, so the new duo works out just fine.To be precise, it's more of a Hunnam's one man show, giving him chances to both showcase the action man and the dramatic actor side of him, and he doesn't disappoint.He really grabs the role by the balls and runs with it - grit, pain, unflittering instinct for survival, he made me buy all that.He wouldn't look out of place among the next batch of male actor Oscar nominations, although ""Papillon's"" early showing in Toronto film festival in September 2017 may have ruined that (any wider release has followed only quite recently).Anyway, the new ""Papillon's"" production values are great, everything looks downright amazing. The movie looks deliciously authentic even in smallest of details, from sweat-drops on characters' bodies to withered prison walls - not to mention 1931's Paris - a true movie lovers' dream.Judging by IMDb, the Danish director Michael Noer seem has plenty of experience with screen stories about criminals, so the atmosphere is also appropriately macho and adrenaline-soaked.So far, so good. Too bad it all doesn't stay that way. The movie achieves its high point somewhere around the middle point, when Papi gets out of the solitary confinement.This section is pretty good in itself, making it psychologically hard to stomach both to hero and the viewer - no hope, no light, almost no words. But after that, one just can't ignore the fact that the story loses any real emotional punch it previously may have had.The problem is that storytelling is sorely lacking some depth, regarding both any characters and the situation they are in.Almost nothing they do is explained adequately, if at all. Why Papillon is so loyal to Louis Dega, for example? How does he survive the solitary so well, both physically and mentally? What keeps him going?And we don't even get to know the basic facts about the intriuing prison environnment: what is the local hierarchy among prisoners? How do prisoners earn the money? For a 133 minute movie, it can really be surprisingly shallow.In the end, we can only summarize that ""Papillon"" is a really cool-looking thriller about some cool-looking dudes. But it could have been something more.The ingredients for making it all work are there - but the bar has been set just all too low.My suggestion is to re-edit and expand the material to re-release it as a mini-series or something.Surely the creative forces behind the camera have plenty of unused scenes and footage which wasn't used due to time restraints?

1931 in France, Safe Cracker, Henri Charriere later known as Papillon (Charlie Hunnam) is framed for murder and sent to the prison in French Guiana and later to Devil's Island. He is known as Papillon because of the Butterfly tattooed on his chest. Attempts at escaping always proved fruitless and landed him in Solitary for 2-year and then in solitary for 5-years and then it was on to Devil's Island.This is a remake of a 1973 movie starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Poppy as he is called by fellow inmates lines himself up with wealthy art forger Louis Dega (Rami Malek) and we see these two survive as best they could and still think about escaping. I am sure the prison life was more brutal than what we saw on screen.I took this out because I had seen the 1973 Papillon, but wanted to see if current technology updated the scenes and or action. No. No CGI. Nothing much changed - the story went on as in 1973. At times the cinematography was outstanding.I noticed that no one spoke French or even had a French accent There were many characters whose names I cannot recall mostly because many were not referred to by name. That was a huge disservice to those players because they were very good and should have been recognized at least by name in the movie.Notables: Yorick van Wageningen as Warden Barrot; Nikola Kent as Deputy Warden Briouelet; Michael Adams as Bartiloni, one of Warden Barrot's enforcers.Papillon in 1973 is a classic and I think this one in 2017 can be also considered such a classic also as it is very good. Not sure why it was remade, but those who didn't see the 1973 version have a great opportunity to see almost a carbon copy of that classic. Charlie Hyunnam and Rami Malek made this work.There are statements at the end to tell all what happened to Papillon and Dega.Violence: Yes.

However, while this remake is a little flawed, I thought it was an awesome rendition for a modern audience.I haven't see the first one all the way through; I caught a few minutes of it here and there on TV. Either way, this new version is a very well-crafted film, with great visuals, decent performances, heart pounding drama, and a critique of the human condition, sacrifice, friendship, and criminal punishment. Hunnam is not the greatest actor of all time, but I've always enjoyed his performances and style. He is far from the worst of today's overly huge bin of ""stars"".I genuinely felt sadness and remorse during the film, and found myself on the edge of my seat in a few scenes.The only real bad things you could say about this version are: Too little explanation of his life in France, and what happened with his frame-up and trial, and why is the final punishment area of Devil's Island nicer than all the other hellholes he lived through? It is supposed to be the final boss of prisons, yet the guys wander around smoking cigs and gardening, and have access to ropes, cloth, art materials, etc. and never seem to be under guard, locked in cages, starving, or working hard. So, looks like you would rather be on that rock than the other crapfests he was in.Overall, it was exciting and interesting, with a nice epilogue about what happened after all the brutality and adventure. I feel the low ratings and hateful reviews stem from people who will NEVER give a remake a chance, because of their love for McQueen and Hoffman, and I am usually against remakes myself. This one is worth a watch.Also, I believe the ""Goofs"" section to be mistaken. If you listen to what the warden originally said, he tells them that the first escape attempt results in 2 yrs. solitary. The next time will be five. So, if you add that up, you get seven years, plus the rest of the time that can be assumed to have passed while they live in the main prison and work details.

It's something they think puts them in a better era. Only pretty much no movie made in 1969 is gonna be as good as our cinema today. The lack of quality acting back in the days and poor picture quality is always the first thing you pick up. This was well acted and Rami Malik is a genius actor. Charlie Hunan was a good fit for this role. A little slow of a story and to be honest doesn't have a huge meaning other then maybe never give up.

64,TheGreatMarkukini,A story not as light as a butterfly but surely as beautiful,8,12 June 2019,"Mysteriously I was expecting the movie from the moment I saw the trailer but then due to my traveling I totally missed it in the theaters and the regret was chasing me until it started selling online. I put away all the things I had to do and started watching long desired dream.The beginning had nothing especially new and even included unbelievably dumb decision that hurt the ideal that I have built in my head. But it was just a little mishap as the events that follow absorb all the attention.The prison theme is not new and dozens of movies have already produced tons of stereotypes but the French Guiana provides you with a special and frightening look at the detention institution. Everything from transportation to ordinary routine gives a feeling of unhuman attitude. The rules of detention are also rough but have some sense.So, in the middle of the ocean in the south American rainforest Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek try to survive and even might think of the grand escape. The evolution of relations is predictable but charming, the ugly truth follows the footsteps of the characters. Remembering the aforementioned praise of prison depiction, I add the performance of Charlie Hunnam and the director's choice that brought us the genius moment of solitary detention that I have never seen before.The whole story keeps you on the edge of your emotions. Without any exaggeration, I can say that I felt imprisoned with the inmates and I was cheering for them to break free from this nightmare at any cost. The ending is amazing and it has blown me up with an incredible gratitude to the director and the cast.Still shaking off the unbelievable feeling that is multiplied by the fact that everything is based on the memoires of a real person I would say that the movie is a jewel that cannot be passed by.Bravo! For this kind of motion pictures I live.",Papillon
65,jeannefrancoise,"Darker than Prison Break, harder than Gulag",9,27 September 2018,"Dear movie fellows, Papillon is the most wanted movie in my country. It is entering in the screenings so late, of course because so many factors, but we already knew the main story from the Internet. While it is coming to Indonesia, it is such a blessing. This movie is not a popular movie, not having typically Hollywood ending, but it brings the strong sense of humanism and how is the deep mind of prisoners, who had been captured unfairly. Papillon has simple main story about how prisoners had tried to escape, been captured, escaped again, and been captured again. The repetition plots in this movie is not boring, because we have Rami Malek's great acting, sad scenes of cinematography, and unbelievable shooting of dark side in Guyanna French prisoners' islands. Rami Malek is not the main actor, but he leads the whole action-reaction scenarios and I am pretty sure he will be great in his next moves in both Hollywood and European film industry. Papillon had big success in America, North America, and Europe and this year I am pretty sure it has more success in Asia, even though it is not popular movie, but is darker than Prison Break and harder than Gulag story. Much appreciation ahead for the Director, Producer, actors, cinematographer, and editor.",Papillon

A great interpretation for Charlie Hunnam and a good quality of the remake, however the film screep is not so intriguing and sometimes the rythm is really slow.

It has lots of detail, and captures the claustrophobia and cruelty these prisoners experienced in French Guiana extremely well. Charlie Hunnam has particularly big boots to fill, I think he is a much under rated actor a bit like Brad Pitt in his younger days. Rami Malek is rapidly getting a much deserved reputation too, this film can only help it along.. It has not attracted as much attention as the original, and that is a pity because it is a thoughtful piece of film making with lots to say about friendship, kindness and the human spirit.",Papillon

71,Luv2Spooge,Unbiased Review,8,29 March 2021,"Remakes are often hard to review for most people because they could not be objective without emotional bias. For example, the Total Recall remake received harsh review from audience who were accustomed to Arnold's original Mars adventure with all that 80s muscle man action star quirks and one liners. Because of that many were not able to judge the new version for its own style as a more futuristic action sci-fi.Other movie remakes such as Ben Hur also faced the same unfair harsh treatment. Papillon would not be an exception either, due to strong attachment by many of the critical audience to the original stars such as McQueen and Hoffman.In an unbaised review, this film was exceptionally made. There were subtle differences in this version compare to the original, most notable were the fight scenes which added a bit of action to rather a melodrama. However, even so, it was not without soul or heart and the friendship between Dega and Papillon was well choreographed to the very end.The updated crisp and HD view gave a more surreal feel to the movie background, that you feel both the beauty of the tropical setting as well as the claustrophobic intent of the solitude imprisonment scene.Overall it is a very well done film and being 30 minutes shorter than the original, a much smoother story telling that will keep you engaged to the very end.I'm giving it 8/10 simply because these kinds of stories don't really interest me in general. It is as high as I can give to these kinds of movie and I doubt I would give the original any higher.",Papillon

Tough film making,6,25 August 2018,"Having been years since I've seen the original Papillon, reviewing this is based on NOT comparing it to the original. The story is compelling (of course), but the character development is minimal at the beginning where our thief is sentenced for murder. After the sentencing is where the story really starts. It's based on a real-life story and is a painful look at a terrible prison system. The acting was excellent! Charlie Hunnam (who played Papillon) certainly looked like he went through a lot of physical changes for the role. And Rami Malek (Louis Dega) was simply incredible at creating the ""pathetic character"" who we saw evolve through the movie. On the production side, it certainly appeared to be a very challenging movie to make.. so I give a lot of credit to the crew who made this movie.",Papillon

Two exceptional performances in Hunnam and Malek, who continue to make their own way as revelations actors, although they can already be considered stars. I did not see the original version, so I probably will not be able to compare this version with the original version, but I do not regret it. The colors, the places they used to record the film, the beauty of the misery in many of the scenes, the mere fact that it teaches us a bit of history of what was really lived in one of the colonies of one of the empires biggest in the world . . exceptional, and the simple fact that it is based on a real story makes it more sublime.

The acting between main characters feels forced and unnatural.Overall, the movie does not seem polished. I think locations were also not that great. The sea wasn't as vivid blue as in the original.

83,longcooljolie,Good effort but misguided remake,7,8 August 2019,"Currently this movie is featured on Amazon Prime as possibly an attempt by the filmmakers to get back some of the budget money. It was a limited theatrical release in 2018 possibly because of unfavorable comparisons to the original with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The original plays like a grand, sweeping adventure with a rousing musical score, some unforgettable scenes, and even some dark humor thrown in here and there.This remake? It just plays out as a competent historical action flick with some good acting. Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek portray the Papillon and Louis Dega characters, respectively and portray the right sense of appropriate desperation and dread at the right times. Yet fans of the original will be comparing every scene from this one to the original and wondering what happened to a slew of characters, situations, and scenes from the original.One hint about one of the major differences between this and the original is that the producers focused too much on the relationship between Papillon and Dega in this one, to the point where it almost becomes homoerotic. There certainly wasn't any sense of that between McQueen and Hoffman; in fact some dark humor moments happen when Papillon becomes annoyed at the fey Dega.The other major difference is that there are scenes showing Papillon cavorting about in Paris as a carefree playboy at the beginning, pre-arrest and then at the end after he has successfully made it to the mainland on his coconut bag raft. By the way, it would have been fun to see Papillon triumphantly arrive at freedom on such a flimsy raft.In all, this was a risky remake for this big reason: the long, drawn-out scope of the story taxes the attention span of the current movie-watching generation. Watch it on Prime and see if you agree with me.",Papillon

87,mymangodfrey,Compassionate and timely.,9,25 August 2018,"I haven't seen the first movie (yet), but it's worth noting that this is not just a remake of a Hollywood movie; it's a second attempt to adapt a pair of culturally important memoirs. That's allowed.The performances in this second Papillon are wonderful, even down to the smallest supporting role. Nobody overplays his role; the acting is naturalistic. The two leads' performances are so committed, though, that I felt real attachment to them, and believed in their friendship.The movie, contrary to what I've read, is not visually dull; it's just not ostentatious.A story this quiet (almost the Buddhist version of a prison-break movie) was never going to light the world on fire. Still, I'm sorry to see it getting so much hate here. It's a well-intentioned and well-made movie, and it had an emotional impact on me.As for the people saying ""why this movie? Why now?"", you might consider reading a book like The New Jim Crow, or reading some recent research reports from groups like Amnesty International on prison conditions in 2018.

Everything seems artificial and posed. Did anyone do any in-depth research? If you're going to do a remake of a classic then look for an original angle and provide a sense of movement rather than just pointing the camera and telling the actors to get on with it. The scenery is as pretty as a douche commercial. Unrelentingly ""nice"". The story lacks any tension. Seen it all before. Perhaps a better writer and a better director?

Nothing was exaggerated, filming was beautiful, pacing gripping and exciting. I can't really flaw the film. ok, so it's been done before, but this was a great film. I definitely recommend. Others also saying 'read the book' as if it isn't true to the real story... well, though based on a true story critics say the book is at most 10% true. So... don't expect any of it to be reality.

Different actors, photo-technology and audience taste in different times, it's like apples and oranges.The Enjoyable: (1) Efficient dialogue, no dragging melodramatic self-important speech or cry-cry sensationalized weepy moments. Even the imprisonment scenes got to the point across, about how Henri struggled to keep his sanity and motivation. 
(2) Escape scenes and prison brawls looked realistic, albeit hard to catch every movement due to dim lighting.
(3) The plot and pace are easy to follow (no bizarre flashbacks / editing), making the 2hr 13 minute film not feeling long to sit through
(4) The historical photos on the penal colony at the movie end credits were thoughtful tributes to the real prisoners. The tone of the film was also serious and created empathy for the inmates. Fights and deaths were portrayed with dread and sadness, not gratuitous violence.The Drag/Let Down:(1) The friendship/ chemistry between Henri and Louis didn't sink in until half way through the movie. The supporting actors also couldn't do much with a few scenes and lines given to them. So, the interactions didn't lead to a moving and inspirational story about the unwavering spirit of friendship, and fight for freedom.Recommend:For those looking for a prison drama-thriller, you'll enjoy the movie.

In this version of Papillon, their performances and particularly the performances of the supporting cast is very good, but the original was a full blown Hollywood epic with two of the biggest stars of their era. Plus, unlike other remakes that bring a less censored version, the 1974 version pulled no punches when it came to gore and suffering, so there was little to add in that respect.So where was it lacking? For starters, the original had a much more sweaty feel to it-the lighting and cinematography always imparted a sense of decay. Everything seemed to be rotting and falling apart, including the people. That whole feel carries over to the solitary confinement scene, and McQueen's fetid hellhole seems dry and sterile and even Hunnam's reputed weight loss just doesn't convey McQueen's abject suffering.This movie is worth watching, but if you have a choice, go with the original.",Papillon

The casting is perfect, and the revised development between the leads has waaaay more heart and on-screen chemistry. Freedom and the unbreakable human spirit are still a significant part of the story but the remake brings the impact of loyalty and friendship into the fold in a way that feels more balanced. It didn't hurt that Hunnam and Malek are ridiculously chisled and nude half the movie. Hahaha",Papillon
121,dondutton,Better left to the original,2,18 August 2018,Why do they make new versions of films done so well in the original? The original Papillon gets an 8 rating in IMDB. Well deserved.

123,stef2000,Unnecessary movie with the worst overacting by Rami Malek,5,6 July 2019,It's not all bad and since the original (true) story is fascinating it's not a waste of time. But as a new movie it's utterly unnecessary because the original is already excellent and superior in every aspect. Same goes for the actors. Hunman/Malek never even get close to McQueen/Hoffman. While Hunman does a somewhat decent job Malek once more delivers a very bad and sometimes even embarrassing case of overacting. You can always see him trying too hard and doing too much and overdoing every look and frown. Not one second he feels like a real person. Watch the original instead!,Papillon

I went in blind outside of knowing that this was some sort of prison escape movie. I did not know that this is a remake of a 1973 and also based upon a true story.Both Rami Malek and Charlie Hunnam act well, and everything looks good, but...the film feels dreary and depressing (ironically, the film is supposed to be about hope). Anyhow, this was probably the wrong film choice for the evening. It's hard for me to watch films where the subject matter can be heavy (e.g. Schindler's List). It's like you're going in there with the intent of intentionally becoming sad. If you're already sad, why does one do that to themselves?",Papillon

Whilst it's a reasonable stand-alone film and not a bad movie, you just find yourself comparing it to the original at every turn. A classic film, is a classic film and should really be left alone.

128,pahvou,Rather surprised,7,3 March 2019,"I chanced upon this movie on Prime. My first thought was you've got to be kidding, a remake of Papillon? There are certain movies that are classics and that applies to the original with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. In my mind a classic should stand alone and scared, only fools would attempt to repeat. Reluctantly, I decided to watch the beginning, knowing full well I would be offended by this remake and quickly turn it off. I was surprised. It was good and I watched the entire movie. What I loved about the movie, while at the same time could have criticized, is that it was a duplicate of the original. As if from the same movie script. There were moments I thought I was actually watching Steve McQueen as Papillon. As to Louis Dega, I did not see as much Dustin Hoffman. In my eyes Rami Malek brought a certain twist to that character, But both performances were excellent.My favorite scene from the original version was missing from the remake. Which surprised me. For this reason I dropped my rating a star. If this has been the original version I would have given the movie a 9, having to hold a perfect 10 for the original.",Papillon
129,jhenrotte,Worth it,7,30 August 2020,"I found this film just as good if not better then the original film. An incredible story of human will, and surviving the worst of the worst. Both films fall short. But both are worth the watch.",Papillon
130,happycarrot68,Why the remake?,7,26 September 2019,"Truly great original film with two outstanding performances, why we need an updated version am not sure but not the worst effort. Lacks the characters of the original although although Papillon himself is a decent effort. Biggest problem with this is Rami Malek, weak performance in all the senses, yes he won a token Oscar which for me was the end of ever taking the Academy Awards seriously ever again as we know which route the films and portrayals are judged these days, let's be brutally honest. Malik simply can't act, he belongs in a C4 soap not in high profile films. The problem with remakes like this is you spend too much time comparing it to the original and it can't compete but as a stand alone film has moments.but you do find yourself losing interest at times.",Papillon
131,julianstrand,A very pale shadow of the 1973 original.,5,21 September 2021,"I've rated this film 5/10 and I think that's fair because it is 'okay' as a film. However, when compared with the 1973 original, it isn't even worth 1/10 as it's vastly inferior in terms of casting, acting, characters, dialogue and action.I have absolutely no idea why this version was ever made. The 1973 version with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman has lost absolutely nothing in terms of entertainment value with the passing of all those decades. This version, in stark contrast, will quickly be forgotten by almost everybody who watches it.If you haven't seen the original, you might enjoy this 2017 remake but it's only an 'average"" film whereas the original is SUPERB.",Papillon
132,jmihalchik-67031,Newsflash: Hollywood is out of Ideas,3,18 February 2019,"There are some movies that you do not reboot. But Hollywood is desperate.
Disagree?
Try to find something on Netflix aimed at the average IQ. If you said ""Baby Boss"", keep looking. Better yet, go take a nap.
I do not think the 1973 version of ""Papillon"" is on anyone's Top Ten List. It's too much to endure.
The original is filthy. It's desperate. Dark. Ugly. Brutal. Disturbing. Sweaty.
It's not a movie you want to watch more than a few times, because it cuts.Comparitively, the remake is almost sexy (with Charlie Hunan's ripped physique), and has a ""day at the beach"" feel to it (despite taking place in one of the most brutal penal colonies in recorded history).
Look no further than the solitary confinement sequences.
Barring a few gray hairs, Hunan's ""Papillon"" emerges none the worse for wear. Mentally, not only does he emerge intact, but borderline witty.
Steve McQueen's ""Papi"" is dragged out ashen, teeth rotting, voice shot, shaken to his core.
But don't blame Hunan. He's too pretty for the part. Did anyone buy his performance as ""Jacks"" in ""Sons of Anarchy""? The tough biker?
Steve McQueen can out-rugged anybody. By the end, you wonder how his character is still alive-- let alone escaping.The scenery and overall vibe is unconvincing. People who spent time in French New Guinea never looked as good as these fellas.
If they were to make a Disney attraction called ""Papillon"", this version of the movie would be the model. It's safe.
The original is far too disturbing, and probably a bit much for our ""Baby Boss"" society.
I guess they will attempt an ""Exorcist"" remake next. Hollywood wouldn't... Would they?",Papillon

Remake but masterpiece movie. Papillon is just like The Shawshank Redemption. But the difference between these two movie papilion has its own move. They don't copy the full storyline. I have enjoyed the full time when I see this. I have never been a fan of the ""remake"". Rarely, if ever, do they meet my expectations so I generally just steer clear saving myself the anger and the money. That being said, why did I watch the remake of Papillon? Simply, I am a big fan of Rami Malek. Hearing he was going to play the part of Louis Dega I was hooked. So, I held my nose, closed my eyes, hoped for the best, and hit PLAY. Well, once again I should have followed my own instincts and saved myself the disappointment!!!! ""Papillon 2017"" sadly, is a mere shadow of the classic 1973 version at best. Gone is the character development between Papillon and Dega which is so beautifully portraited by McQueen and Hoffman in the 73 classic and so very crucial to the story. The 73 original, written by Dalton Trumbo (in my opinion, next to William Wilder, is one of the greatest screenwriters of all time) gives every character an identity.",Papillon

I have to say though this remake of Papillon with Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek is really good. I was excited about viewing this film and it didn't disappoint me.

See Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek as you've never seen them before, as they transformation into the frail, yet unbeatable, Henri ""Papillon"" Charrier and his friend Louis Dega. Based on the memoir of the real 1930's safe-cracker, Hunnam is framed for murder and forced to live out his days in the heinous conditions of a French Guainan labor camp. There is little to laugh about in this prison. The fights are visceral and brutal. The only glimmer of hope throughout is Papillon and Degas' friendship, as it grows while they struggle to stay alive and sane as forgotten men in the pits of Hell. You'll leave this one feeling inspired by the human spirit, and happy in the knowledge that nothing you are currently experiencing is as bad as what these two poor souls had to endure. There is a brief Epilogue before the credits showing you the real Papillon. I give this struggle a Solid, ""Butterfly in the Sky, I Can Fly TWICE as High"", rating.

It just lacked the brutality that was on show here and was surely the case at the time.Charlie was great, not amazing as 'Papi'. But his acting skills from Green Street are a distant memory from this. Much like The Lost Land of Z. But Malik ruled this picture. Beginning with his squirming characteristics like his break out sitcom The War At Home, and ending on notes that have earnt him his critically acclaimed performance in the queen biopic. He is one to watch for future awards but I'd be surprised if he doesn't win for his great Freddie onsamble. Put it all together. More brutality, bigger set. True to the story.

But Worth Watching.,6,28 October 2018,"Right away, I have to say that this film is good, but doesn't capture the enormity of the original, which was epic. Several things made the original better. First, great acting by both McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The score in the first can stand on its own and it helped you feel the proportion of the epic book.This story is enjoyable, and while it is a good production, I didn't feel as though I was experiencing Papillon's entire journey, which was actually told in 2 books. Honestly, if you want to experience Papillon, you have to watch the first movie. You also need to read Henri Charrière's two books. Both Papillon and Banco. They are page turners and you'll understand how difficult it is to portray Papillon's epic tale.This film however, is enjoyable and only people who've seen the earlier movie will understand elements that are referenced and slightly glanced over.Worth watching. Not worth buying. Saving this flick for a rainy day and hopefully it draws you into Papillon's story. Chris Hunnam is good, but homeboy can't carry the film on his own.",Papillon

The original movie for me will always be the optimum story portrayed by two of the most celebrated actors in Hollywood. This more current version is done well and adds more visually then the earlier movie and is enjoyable as well.What I feel that has not been written about is the relationship of both men. They were both jailed and sent to the prison at the same time. These two personalities were nearly opposite and began their relationship with issues mostly of cultural differences. Over time a friendship began, and with that came trust and a bond of two men most do not see in today's world.Ultimately, though difficult mental and physical hardships, they discover who they are in the world. One stays behind and the other continues to seek freedom. This I feel is the message that people need to find themselves and the purpose of their lives to discover personal happiness.",Papillon

It's something I rarely do since I find it unfair to bother with absolute comparison since the 'remake' is exactly that..., a remake.However, a remake signifies something better, something stronger.
But in the case of Papillon (2017) I'm afraid this is not the case.Firstly, the heat. In the original I constantly felt uneasy and scratchy, the heat/humidity in the movie got to me throughout, granted the perspired faces of Hoffman and McQueen were a combination of oil and water but still.
I don't think I saw a drop of sweat in Papillon (2017)In the remake I also clashed with the main protagonists. Henri (charlie hunnam) is way too young and seemingly more at home in a movie like The Fast and the Furious.
Rami Malek (Louis Dega) did a better job but somehow I couldn't get over that voice.
The cinematography could have been a lot better, as well as the story line development.

A man will spend a lifetime trying to escape. What a plot. A movie about friendship, about destiny and the pursue for freedom, 
The cinematography is excellent. The color of the film. The set design. One scene that keep popping into my mind is when the prisoners are first welcome to prison and the warden is telling them about the rules they must follow. The warden was an excellent antagonist. The choice of customer design made him look like dictator who lack any remorse. Just looking at him you knew he had no empathy for anybody. And of course the movie executed brilliantly in increasing the stakes as the film progress to lead to a finale that will grab and twist your emotions and even make you cry.

Too much creative liberty (in both movies to be fair), horrible casting, bad scenography, some laughable flops like jumping into still Mediterranean ocean.2017 Papillon is a movie tailored to the general population starting with a love story and adding Louis Vega relationship as a main point of the movie, while in book Louis Vega is just of of many characters that come and go.

I'm a fan of Charlie hunnam and a huge fan of remi malek they play there roles well it won't be there best film ever but very much worth the watch.,Papillon

176,miike-52468,"Without comparison, it's a respectful attempt to tell the story of human resilience based on a true story",8,7 March 2019,Papillon is a movie starring Charlie Hunnan and Rami Malek directed by Michael Noer based on the true story of Henri Charriere (Pappilon) and his incredible will to escape prison for a crime he didn't commit. The depth of the story overreaches every other aspect of the movie.Hunnan and Malek are terrific with very minimal dialogue to work with. They build an unspoken and powerful friendship that carries throughout the horror of the French Guinea prison they are sent to. The supporting cast is equally powerful under the directing of Noer.The scenery and effects are secondary to the story and relationships built in the brutal reality of this prison. The music is rare but suspensful and heartfelt. I enjoyed this movie way more than I expected to and would recommend it to anyone interested in true stories of human spirit and compassion.,Papillon

This kept true to the original for the most part and I was never left looking at my watch or phone.What really sets this one apart, though, is the score. The music is beautiful!

Back in the 1980's, when I was a kid, we would see all the classics on TV, and it makes you so intelligent and cultured watching those films. The new generations? 50 IQ super hero movies, reboots, CGI porn, and remakes that are shadows of the originals.Hollywood, you need to stop erasing history. I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. You're not going to get your global socialist dystopia. You're going to fail to destroy Western culture and history.STOOOOOOOOOOP.

194,DaveduFresne80,A very good remake!,8,13 December 2018,"I'm very old school, even though I'm only in my late thirties. I grew up in a poor family that only had a black and white TV until the early 90s, and never had cable. So mostly, I saw old movies on TV. In the last ten years or so, I have mostly given up on Hollywood, too many superhero films, prequels, sequels and what have you. Also, there's something missing with young actors, like they are light on life experience or real toughness that they try to portray. I think the golden age actors who mostly had to serve in the military or at least experienced the depression had a natural edge here. I probably never would have given this film a chance, but was stuck on a long flight and found it will browsing the films on offer.
Naturally, I had seen the original many times, the first probably going back to childhood. I also revisited it after getting back home. The older film looks to be set on location, and that helps it, as the scenery is kind of a costar. The newer film looks to be set elsewhere. The acting of Steve McQueen was quite good in the original and I don't think is topped here. Hoffman's acting is too meek for my taste and I never quite got the friendship in the original, whereas the actor that plays Dega in the new version is somewhat nerdy, but has a lot more life in him and it is believable to me that with Papillon's protection, a little luck, and time to acclimate, he could eventually learn to survive. Hoffman's character does not seem like someone who could survive with rough prisoners and even tougher environment, I just don't buy it, particularly when his protector is often in solitary for years.
The problem with both films is it is unclear exactly what Papillon is surviving for, although this remake gives us a snapshot of the wealth and women Papillon had, and I imagine hopes to return to. It really needs to be an old fashioned epic type film, where the first half is an amazing safe cracking job along with a romance, and the second half is the prison scenes, something like that, probably making it a 3 hour film, like Lawrence of Arabia or something, Perhaps Papillon doesn't merit that treatment but I think it would be a stronger film for it.
This version has more action than the original which makes Papillon's success a bit more supernatural, but the original has a lot of unlikely events as well. I didn't like the warden being so stereotypical in the new version, although upon reseeing the original, he is somewhat similar, although less extreme. I can't imagine a warden being all that interested in how you got some coconuts. Sure he might put him on half rations with a good chance of death, but I would think he would leave it at that, and not bring in beef stew months later in an attempt to play good cop and get him to confess. Anything is possible I suppose, but this seems very unlikely.
I read that in the original McQueen and Hoffman did not get along, and to me that shows in the performance. Only at the end do we sense a real friendship, while in the remake we sense it much earlier and so Papillon's loyalty makes a bit more sense (still unlikely unless the convict's code was what was keeping him from ratting). I would say technically speaking the acting is a wash, with the new Papillon's acting being somewhat worse and the new Dega's being somewhat better. But I think most viewers unless they are looking to learn about method acting will enjoy the acting in the newer version more.
There are some things left out in the new version, like a visit to a leper colony while on the run which was quite memorable. My advice would be to see them both, and if you have already seen the original, give this newer version a chance. For people who know nothing of McQueen's acting they will almost definitely enjoy this, for those who do, if you are willing to watch someone play the part differently, you can enjoy it as well. Although I saw it for free, I would have been more than happy to pay the price of admission for this film.",Papillon
195,linescraig,More like a Moth,3,2 November 2018,"As many other reviewers have commented, the original version (1973 - when some classic films were made) is almost flawless because it has the atmosphere, peril and drama of Charriere's real-life experiences. This unnecessary remake suffers from the same issues that spoil many 'present day' films; too many Producers who know zero about script writing. Script Writers who know zero about drama. Directors who put the 'photography' above the content, when in reality 99 percent of viewers don't give a flying fox about lighting and grading, and Actors whose egos far outweigh their talent.
Papillon, the book, is a true masterpiece for so many reasons and it's almost a natural screenplay - what the Producers, Writers and Director have done here is managed to sum up the book like a Twitter Post rather than a script, missing out on the absolutely wonderful, scary, heartfelt and funny scenarios that Charriere went through for real. The film was also shot in Malta, presumably for the South American scenes, and probably in Winter because there are many scenes where it's clearly cold enough to see the breath of the actors. I mean, if you are going to spend a lot of money on a film, at least go somewhere more authentic and save your money elsewhere.
So, forget about this attempt, it's insulting to the memory of Charriere. First, read the book, then check out the '73 version with McQueen and Hoffman.
This poor attempt is not so much a butterfly, more like a moth.",Papillon

For the original Papillon the film was loosely based on Henri Charrie's experiences in the penal settlement in South America, so, for this new interpretation of those stories, would have been nice to see something entirely new. A new plot, to go somewhere with this fantastic yarn where the original hadn't been. There lay the problem with this film. Okay, it's well acted, nicely shot in parts, good dialogue, all new and fresh, but why it chose the path to copy the original movie scene by scene beggars belief. Make a NEW story, go somewhere new, alter the plot a little, take us on yet another escape escapade! But no, instead we are left with a scene by scene remake and thats what lets this film down.

It is surprising that such a movie got only 6.8 on IMDb I went and read the reviews and now I understand why. A lot of people who've seen the original movie from the 70s didn't like this one as much. I haven't seen the original and I didn't know the story so my review is clean and objective. It is a thrilling movie with good acting and very nice editing and directing. The scenes are well-built and the story is good. I did however feel that there were some plot holes in the movie though who knows maybe that was really how it happened in real life. So a little spoiler alert here, I didn't understand why Devil's Island was a bigger punishment than isolation. It actually seemed even better than the regular prisonment.

I love the original Papillon and was curious to see what type of damage they could do with this remake. So I watched it. It was painful and hard to do, but I did it. It wasn't hard to watch because of the content subject matter, it was difficult to watch because it was done so poorly. There were so many thing that it's hard to say them all. They did try and put some male and female gratuitous nudity in it from time to time, but they was a cheap ploy to salvage what they knew was going to be a slop. They even stole little bits from other movies, like ""Pretty Woman"". Did they think no one would notice? Another thing is that the prisoners are supposed to look malnourished, but the actors' had a good amounts of muscle tone and fat that it was hard to believe. The special effect/makeup were terrible. It looked like a bad TV movie. Not to mention that the casting director should have been fired. Overall, I couldn't care less what happened to any of these characters.

Some of the dialogue was hard to believe as fitting into the 1930's.

WHERE'S CLUSIOT!?"" Etc. Throughout the film.The performances are good, of course! If I hadn't read the book I probably would've liked the movie.

The cinematography was good, capturing the dismal conditions Papi was kept in, and I was impressed by the supporting cast more than the star.
The book transported me, and I felt every blow, every struggle, every day, and the exhilaration of the escapes. For me, that was what the book was about, more than the jail time. But this film doesn't come close to relaying that feeling on the viewer.
Rami Malek was excellent, and the sadistic governor too, but the end was a bit rushed. Personally, I think it would have benefitted from another 40 minutes, going over his survival inside, the interaction between the many characters in the book, and his subsequent new life in Venezuela. The last line, paraphrased, is; ""this is not a story about me, it is a story about many men,"" highlighted what the book was about, but sadly, the film seems to have missed this point.

The acting was top notch, touching in ever way, Charlie Hunnam is fantastic in this film along with Damijan Oklopdzic, music score outstanding, overall an excellent film, forget the bad reviews and watch the film for yourself.

238,walterohlinger,"Big Big Fan of McQueen & Hoffman, becoming fan of Hunnam & Malek",8,3 March 2019,"First let me 73 acting was superior on many levels. I give kudos to Hunnam and Malek for even trying to step into those famous roles. This remake has rewarding elements that will gratify the old movie goer. It is worthwhile to give it the time and open mind needed to separate the coarse edged original from this modern polished remake.My primary complaint is about the filming location. No matter how hard they tried, the Med does not in anyway give the sense of the hellish heat and humidity of the Guianas. This is especially true in the final scene where the desired relentless pounding of the Atlantic looked like a calm sunny day in the Mediterranean...which it was.Watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is...a modern remake of a classic.",Papillon

240,lucy_briggs,Harrowing - brutal - well acted - beautiful,8,16 April 2021,"I've never seen the original so I came at this film from a completely unbiased perspective. As such, I thought it was brilliant.The two main characters manage to convey a unique, unshakable bond in spite of minimal dialogue between them.Papillon's close encounters, but evasions of insanity are moving and relatable. WITHOUT going so far out that they become corny.The central premise of the brutality of man stays with you long after the film is finished; and that's testament to the script and director because it is SO well displayed.The suspense is knife edge throughout most of the film. Partly because Of the known risks, but also because we are so emotionally involved with Degas. This is testament to Malek's performance.The inclusion of light and colour the island has offers adds a stark contrast to a lot of American prison flicks: it gives you HOPE. It's appealing to watch, but also reminds us they there is a beautiful world out there just itching to be enjoyed.I know the original was a classic. I know it will be pretty much impossible to beat. But give this a go as a stand-alone movie with an open mind. It holds up!",Papillon

The original was amazing and reminds you of one of those movies you can watch every 3 to 5 years and still enjoy over and over.This version was really bad for me. I am not complaining about the actors it is that why make a new one when it is worse than the original. I do not understand it, kinda like making a new Spider man every few years just a waste of time.If you are trying to make a movie like this to better the original which was epic then you better do it right and they failed on this one....boring for me I think the Director was to blame on this one.

The ability to move between different personalities of both Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek was incredible.Henri started out as a character that looked above, without a care for anyone else except his goals. Louis Dega (Rami Malek) started out as a weasel, who needed protection and looked down, but spoke his mind regrettably. Halfway through the show, both character began to cross each other's personalities, but it was much deeper than that.They began to find out who they really are, deep down, and they needed each other to realize this. At the end of the show, Henri became more like Louis and vice versa.Regardless of whether there were flaws that didn't relate to the original book and story, this movie is underrated due to the performance of both leading actors.These are the types of movies i continue to search through, because even if it is not 100% accurate, it's the actors ability to make the movie better than what it was supposed to be.

247,NorseCherokee,Fell Just a Little Flat,6,16 March 2019,"The 2017 version of Papillon was not bad. The performances by Hunnan and Malek were actually very good. However, compared to the 1973 version, their characters fell a little flat as did the telling of the story. Scenes seemed to be rushed not giving the audience a chance to develop an emotional bond to the characters. Also, the charm that Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman brought to their characters in the 1973 version was lost in this latest retelling. I mildly enjoyed the movie but I think I would have enjoyed this version more if I had not recently re-watched the 1973 version.",Papillon
248,tylernoahkc,Better/more realistic than the original,9,8 March 2019,"Papillon originally is still incredible in every way, with Dustin Hoffman & McQueen creating a very unexpected but working chemistry, but it was made in the 70's. Things weren't as reality-based and a prison-themed film like this, especially centered on arguably the most notorious penal colony ever due to its horrific conditions, needed a remake. I really don't like remakes but this was very well made. Charlie Hunhams best performance, really starting to establish himself now after the lost city of Z or whatever. I knew Remi Malek would be a Star the moment I saw him in the pacific (hbo) in 2010, and he somehow managed to recreate Hoffman's performance in his own way. I loved this film. I'm not just a movie buff either. I'm from the Kansas City Art Institute's film department and I know a good one when I see it lol. Just watch this. Trust me. If you like those shocking prison type movies then this is it. Starred Up is great, too. Check that out. Bronson's not as good as people say. But it's good. Starred Up though, check that out. That term is British and it's when a minor gets moved to the adult prison because they're too violent. It's Jack O'Connells best role, and his dad's in prison with him so it's pretty crazy.",Papillon

It's unfortunate that is film was released via the film festival route to a smaller audience, it deserves a wider look. Charlie and Rami's portrayal of these two mens relationship was pure love... without the erotic undertones.If your a man with a solid grip on your sexuality and open to expressing emotions, I suggest taking your best buddy to see this.

If you want to get close to the original story, the authenticity of which itself is debated, read the book. Regardless of how much is actually true it's a great read.
The McQueen & Hoffman film is good no doubt, especially the scenes in solitary and the leper colony but I don't think this version is without merit. The performances are nuanced and the direction and cinematography seem competent enough (although I'm no expert). So long as you watch it with an open mind and don't expect too much you'll have a 7/10 experience.
(As usual ignore the 1/10 movie purists/twits who think that giving a film that score gives them some kind of kudos. It doesn't, it just makes them look rather, well, sad. Few films are actually 1/10 bad and this isn't one of them.)",Papillon

Who thought they might improve upon it?
I watched this movie so I could review it with good conscience.
If the original had never been made, I undoubtedly would have enjoyed this movie more and rated it higher.
Unfortunate for this movie is it will forever be compared to the original, and it will always come up short.
Sad that young millennials might not even know this is a poor substitute for the original.
Sadder still it will probably end up with a better rating because the young voters think the actors are ""hot"".

Seems a few reviewers invoke the power of the book as reason for a high score. Some even chastise folks for not reading.

The original movie (Papillon 1973) is a masterpiece, with Steve McQueen's fantastic acting, and Rebuilding it was just a waste of resources.
Of course, we've seen a great movie right now! And I think the screenplay in this movie was a little better, but the acting of Steve McQueen was definitely more powerful.

266,ghostshades,Charlie Hunnam steps into the light,8,30 October 2018,"Yes, classics are hard to remake. The common verdict of score seven is quite accurate, but for two reasons I'm handing out eight personally; as an old jailbird myself, any decent movie where at least one of the guys gets his freedom, body and mind somewhat intact will get a chance of an extra point so here I give 0.5 without spoiling too much....and if an up and comer, Like Charlie Hunnam, rises to the challenge of doing the lead in a movie like this - a maker or a breaker basically - There's another chance of extra sparkles. So that's the other half of my +1. Hope he keeps choosing the good ones furthermore, there's good hope for further future success! With Di Caprio, comparatively - well connected to get the right parts and all - Shutter Island got me quite convinced and Wolf of Wall Street is where he finally nailed it and ""became who he was born to be"", at least according toYours Truly....Good job Papi.",Papillon

Unfortunately the same does not apply to Charlie Hunnam.While the director was desperately trying to capture the atmosphere of the original movie, the poor lighting effects just to make it flat so it gives a feel of an old movie was a really bad approach. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Also, instead of spending precious frames on Charlie Hunnam standing in the sea (with the same and seemingly the only facial expression he can produce) flashing seconds of the storm for example would have been a better path to go down...

It was always going to be compared with the original and had way too much to live up to. Nobody is ever going to better a performance by Steve McQueen, or even Dustin Hoffman. And to choose Charlie Hunnam to take on the titular role, had to have been someone idea of a joke!!The director would have us believe that French crooks in 1930's Paris sound exactly like Chicago mobsters! All except Hunnam, that is, who can't seem to maintain an accent at all. From that opening moment on, you know how this will play out.The source biography (one of my all time favourite books), has such a wealth of material to draw from, that even the brilliant original film had to leave out so much for the final release. This new film could have, and should have, tried to be more than that first. Instead, it skipped over, or left out many crucially important details. I wonder if the film makers even bothered to read the book.All in all, I was very disappointed with this offering. I wasn't entirely surprised (when I read that Charlie Hunnam was to play papillon, I knew it couldn't possibly be much good), but I was still disappointed. A small part of me hoped that a new working of a book I love would tick all the right boxes. Instead, I'm left wondering, what was the point?",Papillon

So then, here it is.Created for a wider audience, the movie touches upon but cannot well portray the reality of solitary confinement that leads to despair and insanity. Survival may be about fist fighting, hiding money, keeping the mouth shut and probably camaraderie (or lack thereof), but it appears there's a compelling attraction towards freedom even if it's for the sake of love or getting out into the open.Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek show why this is not yet another prison break movie.

This movie however is an utter disgrace to the wonderful and incredible journeys of Papillon. This movie shows no respect and absolutely no initiative to remake the incredible stories that Papillon describes and was involved in.
If you are to make movies about great historicaø achievments, make them so with the joy and respect it deserves. And this movie should rename itself as it's misleading to what actually happened on Papillon's way to become a free man.",Papillon
299,cdecavalla,Watered down remake,4,14 November 2018,"Where do I start? From the pathetic attempt at trying to recreate a tropical jungle by placing a couple of palm fronds in every shot, to the two dimensional characters, the film was a huge disappointment. The original film did have faults but was able to draw you in with likeable characters with believable reactions to their situation. There was no sense of time or hardship or the contrast offered by papillon's time with the native Indians. I nearly pissed myself laughing seeing the two guys after a 5 year stretch in solitary confinement looking not a day older or thinner and just perhaps appearing to be having a bad hair day. I recommend seeing the original Papillon to anyone thinking of watching this one first. The movie randomly copies the original dialogue and yet fails to deliver the depth. The movie adds nothing to the original plot and lazilyand poorly tries to replicate the original. The two main actors are capable of much better performances as well.",Papillon
300,heyjude85-652-24000,Well worth watching,9,10 February 2019,"I lot of people complain about remakes, and yes I get it, bring on something new. However, this is a remake was superb. The acting was top notch and really showed the gritty underbelly of the French prison service.
As someone who hasn't watched the original and never would really consider it, I am glad for the remake and that chance to see this side of history.",Papillon

303,patrickj-o-mahony,Sooooo Bad,1,16 May 2019,"If I hadn't seen the original or read the book then I might have given this a 3. Why on earth did they make this? Everything fails, setting, costumes, dialog, humour, acting, soul...I could only watch an hour of it , kept comparing it to the original, which I then watched in full and thoroughly enjoyed for the third or fourth time.Papillion wrote another book, Banco, why not turn that into a movie, there is nothing here, watch the original. McQueen and Hoffman from 1974.
My guess is somebody somewhere decided that there was a profit to be made somehow, preying on those who haven't watched any of the great movies from the 70's.I could go on and on, but just had to write something down to forget about the very existence of this.",Papillon
304,njvent226,A poor rendition of a fantastic book,2,16 May 2019,This movie gives about as much justice to the book/story as France gave to Papillon through a wrongful conviction and a sentence in the Penal system. Poor character development and storyline. Doesn't even contain a fraction of the events that happened or develop any real sense of what life in the system or beyond it was actually like. Read the book and see for yourself.,Papillon

307,mattiaswigforss,Not convincing,5,22 September 2018,"Another remake of a timeless classic and it fails to deliver. Sure, it has its moments but the McQueen/Hoffman original is far more intense and convincing. Just look at the image gallery for that version here at IMDB; those are convincing enough imho",Papillon
308,davidwebb-26528,Worthy but pointless remake,6,26 September 2019,"The original version was one of many excellent films from the seventies, truly one of cinema's greatest decades. You don't remake The Sting, The Godfather, Cabaret,The Exorcist, Deliverance or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest so why remake Papillon? The new version is honest and worthy but it's flat and it's bland and if it wasn't for the efforts of Hunnam and Malek in the two principle roles then the film would be barely watchable. They don't have a lot to work with script wise and the direction is all over the place.What did director Michael Noer do previously to earn a stab at this ? I am not sure . Some scenes seem to copy faithfully scenes from the original so you know what's coming before it happens but when they do depart from the original it doesn't work either,for example compare the opening of the original against that of this remake where you see a little background of events leading up to Papillon's arrest and imprisonment. It wasn't necessary to show it. This film appears to be based on the original film lock stock and barrel instead of maybe venturing into the pages of the two enormous novels that Charriere wrote about his years in captivity. You feel the level of suffering much more in the original than this remake and I felt the black and white footage and photos that end the film conveyed the horrors of being in captivity much more than the preceding two hours.After the cruelly underrated Lost City of Z and this Hunnam will continue to see his stock rise and Malek already has his Oscar .I'd like to remember this film as being part of these two actors journey in cinema rather than it being a good remake of a seventies classic which it falls way short of.",Papillon
309,oliveuh,Unexpectedly outstanding,10,2 September 2018,Now I haven't seen the original so I cannot compare this one to it. It was such authentic acting with increasingly exhilarating progression and climactic story!! Charlie Hunnum is such an underrated actor and should get great recognition for this. Had such a thrilling experiencing watching this that I had to rush to the bookstore right after seeing to purchase the book!,Papillon

It's a shame!",Papillon
314,robdownes,Closer to the book,9,19 June 2020,"Why oh why do people keep going on about the 1973 movie. Papillon is a BOOK not a movie, and the 73 version missed lots out and altered the chronology. This movie is a fine adaptation of the book and I highly recommend it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",Papillon
315,quark-80208,Still a great storyline,7,29 August 2018,"I love this remake. I loved the original.
The only things I have issue with on the remake are the exteriors portraying French Guiana. I know this remake was shot in Europe. You'd think with modern technology they could've made it look like Guiana as opposed to Europe.
 The portrayal of the Salvation islands, especially Devils Island, is so historically incorrect. 
I still love the storyline. Charlie and Remi were perfect in their roles.
In the original, you could feel their plight from jungle diseases and atmosphere. This one just looked like a dreary day in Serbia.",Papillon

318,jerriskinner-29206,PAPILLON - A MORE REALISTIC TELLING OF THE STORY.,10,31 August 2018,"I've never seen the original 1973 film
That being said, I found this film to be an excellent movie. The director brought a fresh perspective that resonates with the current ""prisons for profit mentality"" in the US. The lead actors did a credible job of portraying the real life individuals in the film, with all their faults. I was particularly impressed with Mr. Hunnam's portrayal of Papi, his ability to show the character's human brutality and vulnerability as well as the friendship, loyalty and love that Papi develops for Dega is Oscar worthy. Mr. Malek's portrayal of the nervously optimistic Dega is outstanding. Also noteworthy are Michael Socha as Julot, a fellow prisoner and understatedly terrifying is Yorick van Wageningen as the prison warden. Cinematography is excellent, great contrast between the bleakness of the prison and beauty of the city and jungle. Highly recommend this film, it will haunt you for days",Papillon

321,manofangery,"Shoots for the sky, but misses the mark.",5,26 August 2018,"This movie already has an uphill battle ahead of it by proxy, being a remake of the 1973 classic, and that's where I'm sure most criticism this movie gets will stem from. So let me get this out of the way now: This review will NOT be a comparison to the 1973 original. This movie will be reviewed as its own work, and I will not compare it to the original unless its deviations raise a legitimate question.On its own, this is a perfectly watchable movie. Serviceable performances all around. Rami Malek in particular does a great job with what he's given, although that's to be expected from him. The issue here lies in the dialogue. The writing is okay at best, diving into outright cringe-worthy at the very worst. There were quite a few times where I found myself quietly snickering to myself because of just how forced and clichéd the dialogue felt.The action is decent. It never devolves into outright shaky cam, but most of the action is still shot from too close up and thus becomes hard to follow. It ends up looking like the studio was trying to hide the more grisly aspects of the action, which is never a good mentality to have while shooting an R-rated flick.On that note, the movie really cannot seem to make up its mind whether it wants to go all-in on the R-rating or scale things back, to the point where it seems like the movie's most explicit moments were added solely to avoid a lower rating. Prime example? Just three scenes in, we're treated to at least eight exposed breasts. Very next scene? PG-13 sex. A few scenes later, an extra gets disemboweled on camera in vivid detail. The movie never comes close to attempting this level of gore again until the final kills. The biggest issue with the movie, however, is the pacing. The movie is 133 minutes long, but it will quickly start to feel like a 3+ hour ride. Why is this? Well, because the second act is just too goddamn slow. The solitary confinement sequence is admittedly great... until you realize that it just keeps on going without any development being made.In contrast, other threads are resolved too fast, causing the runtime to feel rather unjustified. This is the one area where I feel the need to compare to the original, as there, the great deal of planning that went into Henri's escapes is shown in detail. Here, they just sort of... happen, and feel rather contrived. And in a film based on a true story, a lack of this type of detail is kind of the worst that can happen.Overall, it's a perfectly serviceable film, but with all of its issues with pacing, writing, and content, and the existence of the original which is miles better, I can't recommend it to anyone really looking for a good time.",Papillon
322,coksaa,THE BEST MOVIE EVER,10,3 January 2019,"This is the best movie I ever watchedFriendship two main characters are beautifully shown.Charlie Hunnam is great. His sarcasm in some parts is funny and I like it. Rami is also great.I was so focused on the screen as I watched the film and I was sympathetic to Papi. It was really hard to see him closed in the dungeon without light and lack of food.The end of the film is not as I thought it would be, I felt sad. And it shows that it's not just some stupid Hollywood movie.I looked at the movie a few days ago but I'm still under impression and I think I'll be forever.You definitely have to look at this movie. Watch him as if you did not have watch the first movie.If I did not watched at this movie I would not even know that there is one in 1973. I think the remakes are good for new generations.I do not like people who say that the classic must remain a classic. If this is not the new movie, many would not know about the old. Anyway, what would it be if those people watching the 1973 movie dies and later film dies with them because the new generations did not know about the classics?JUST WATCH IT! IT'S GREAT!",Papillon

Doesn't sound like it. When I first read the book, it instantly became my favorite. 500 pages of adventure! With that said, neither movie compares. The original was slow, boring, and wildly inaccurate. This new movie, was good, but not great. Hunman played more as Jax Teller from SOA rather than Papillon. More street gangster than regal thief. This movie focused on the actual prison escaping instead of the adventure that happened outside those walls. They tried to cram 3 stories into one and it didnt flow well or make sense. I guess they will never be able to make a movie as good as this book. My suggestion is, READ THE BOOK! In the book you are in his head, the movie you only watch. I wish there was more inner dialogue in the movie to match that of the book.",Papillon
327,wescartee-13749,Had high hopes,7,27 October 2018,"I really wanted this movie to beat the original, but it was only half as good. The original made you feel for the characters, but this one seemed rushed. The actors that portrayed the main two were perfect, but the way the story was filmed lacked detail. The director is to blame on this one. The original papillon will always be one of my favorite movies.",Papillon

I was surprised to see that they made a remake after it, and I couldn't wait to see it, hoping that it will be at least very good, compared to the original, regarding the today's technology who allows you to create events, characters, decor's, etc.......It's not the case in this movie.......it's movie sets are almost horrible, historical accuracy inexistent, and so far from the general book ideas........Papillon was making friends with Louis Dega in Conciergerie prison, not on the boat, he had his money tube due to Dega's help and advise, not from extorting Dega in return for protection, Dega was 42 years old, not a young pup like in this remake, and the list can go on and on. Where is the key fight from the Caen Central prison, where he became friends with Joulot-the hammer guy,where is Galgani asking Papillon's help before islands departure, etc, etc, etc. On the islands, Santini was a convict, not a prison guard and the scene with the prison officer it's totally out of the context, because it does not exist in the book. On the short.........the movie is so far of being acceptable, it does not worth to be compared with the original one, and way too far from the book.....I did not had the patience to watch it till the end, I got the book again and i'll watch the original one once more 😉",Papillon

334,leakneze,Interesting,7,26 December 2018,"I should start off by mentioning I haven't seen the original nor have I reda the book so I'm not comparing to anything. The acting was outstanding, in my opinion. Props to Rami Malek, he's been doing great lately. I'm very easily triggered by emotional scenes so I did cry a bit. I think the characters could've been explored a bit more, I felt like I didn't know them. Personally, I think that the best way to make a viewer feel something is by making the characters human-like and show in-depth who they are. The friendship between Papillon and Louis Dega was beautiful, yet very.... sudden? I felt like they didn't really like each other much until - all of a sudden -Papillon was willing to risk his life for Dega. I would've liked to see more of their friendship actually forming. But overall, I think the movie deserves more praise than it's given. However, I understand that many people who've seen the original are disappointed.",Papillon
