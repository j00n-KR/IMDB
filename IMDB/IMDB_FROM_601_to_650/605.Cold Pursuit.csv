0,Leofwine_draca,Straight remake,7,4 November 2019,"COLD PURSUIT is a straightforward English language remake of the Scandi crime comedy IN ORDER OF DISAPPEARANCE, starring Stellan Skarsgaard. It follows that movie's plot very closely and has the same mix of extreme violence and dark comedy to see it through, which perhaps gives it an edge over the more mundane thrillers that Liam Neeson has been churning out lately. He's a good choice for the role of the taciturn grieving father, while the lengthy supporting cast put in a lot of effort to inhabit their larger-than-life character roles. Unusually for a remake, I found myself enjoying it a lot more than the original; it seems snappier, despite the two hour running time, the inevitability of it counts for a lot, and the Tarantino-style deadpan humour hits home time and again.",Cold Pursuit
1,SnoopyStyle,Taken with Tarantino,5,1 May 2019,"Nels Coxman (Liam Neeson) lives a quiet life snowplowing the same road over and over again in the ski resort town of Kehoe, Colorado. His son is murdered and the cops presume it to be a druggie OD. His wife Grace (Laura Dern) leaves him. He is set to commit suicide when his son's workmate reveals the real reason for his son's murder. He sets off to hunt down the drug ring responsible one by one all the way to their leader Viking. Viking mistakenly starts a deadly war with an Indian drug gang. Meanwhile, local cop Kim Dash (Emmy Rossum) is putting the pieces together.After Taken, Liam Neeson has made a series of similar fare. He brings the same sensibility and then the movie starts taking quirky turns. It's trying to have out the left field quirkiness. It's trying to be deadpan funny. In a few times, the movie gets there. It tries to have the behind the scene conversations from the hitmen. It's been done. It tries to orchestrate a final all out shootout but it's missing the cops. It's obvious that's where the movie is headed. It doesn't achieve all of its goals. Neeson is not necessarily the right fit for this and his controversy doesn't help.",Cold Pursuit
2,Prismark10,Cold Pursuit,6,10 September 2020,"In a snow drenched ski town in Colorado. Nels Coxman (Liam Neeson) a snow plough driver's world is disintegrating after his son dies of a suspected drug overdose.When Nels discovers that his son was murdered, he goes after revenge against the drug gang who were involved in his son's death. Nels manages to orchestrate a gang war.Cold Pursuit is a remake of the Norwegian film, In Order Of Disappearance. It is better than Neeson's recent action fare since he hit unexpected bullseye in Taken.The movie has hard action in a bleak snowy landscape. It also has a lot of black humour making it rather quirky and offbeat.Some thought has gone into the movie and the characters. As if the makers were deconstructing Neeson's other revenge thrillers and playing around with the tropes.",Cold Pursuit

His dad (Liam Neeson) suspects foul play and goes ""Liam Neeson"" all over them. Except this Liam Neeson drives a snowplow and has lost a step...not Harry Brown bad, but he wheezes.

4,kosmasp,In Order of ... releasing,6,10 October 2020,"I would suggest before you watch this or think about watching it: go and watch the original! Way better, way funnier (darker) and feels generally better in tone. Now obviously some may think this is Taken or like Taken - it is not. Which makes some of the people watching this already mad. Especially because they don't know the movie this is based on.I can only urge you so much to watch the other movie. Which doesn't mean this is bad. The movie this takes its cues from was too good for them to mess the remake up. The actors here try their best though and if you don't care for subtitles (which many will need since it is not in English, the Original that is), you could do far worse.",Cold Pursuit
5,classicsoncall,"""I thought you were a kidnapper.""",7,8 September 2019,"I saw a trailer for this film and expected it to be your basic revenge flick, but the neat thing about it was the creative use of an episodic style in a chronologically linear story. The placement of the title cards signifying each cast member 'in order of disappearance' was a nice touch, and as always, Liam Neeson provides the adrenaline for a well paced story, even if he's getting a little long in the tooth as they say. Then again, I'm about a year and a half older than Neeson, and able to relate to his methodical style without working up too much of a sweat. I also liked the character nicknames, adding a bit of color to the proceedings as the action ratcheted up with the Native American/Mafioso style gang war. The kid Ryan (Nicholas Holmes) was a little annoying in the early going, perhaps a bit too adult for his own good with Dad's (Tom Bateman) thug accomplices, but they were cool enough with the kid. What I liked best I think, was how Nels' (Neeson) brother Brock (William Forsythe) covered for him with every lie that passed his lips, knowing that he was on a one way trip with The Viking's hoods. The final showdown when Nels drops the tree on The Viking demonstrated a profoundly original and creative use for modern vehicular technology, and was just one of the many great ways in the picture Neeson's character managed to bring about a Citizen of the Year send-off.",Cold Pursuit
6,Tweekums,A solid revenge thriller with a just the right about of humour,8,8 December 2019,"Set in the fictional Rocky Mountain resort of Kehoe, this film is centred on Nels Coxman; the town's snowplough driver whose life is changed when his son is found dead. He had suffered a heroin overdose but Nels was adamant that his son wasn't a junkie. When he learns that he was in fact murdered he sets about finding those responsible and taking his revenge. As he picks off junior drug dealers their boss, Trevor 'Viking' Calcote, assumes a rival drug dealer, White Bull, is moving against him so fights back against the wrong people, starting a turf war. The body count quickly mounts.If you enjoy revenge thrillers with a touch of humour then this is well worth watching. The story may not provide too many surprises but that doesn't matter. The trail of revenge leaves many dead bodies but for the most part it isn't too gory and one never feels that our protagonist is in real danger, even if some of those close to him may be. The story moves at a decent pace with the deaths being balanced out by some funny moments; some chuckle inducing, others laugh out loud funny. Not surprisingly Liam Neeson impresses as Nils Coxman, it is a role similar to others he has produced; the quiet man who is dangerous when pushed too far. The supporting cast is solid; Tom Bateman may not be physically imposing but his performance as 'Viking' was fun... I loved his complete misunderstanding of the message in 'The Lord of the Flies'! The setting is great with the Canadian Rockies filling in for Colorado. Overall this may not be for everybody but if you enjoy the revenge genre I'd heartily recommend it.",Cold Pursuit
7,Coventry,"""Do you have any idea what I can do to you ... on Yelp?""",7,25 November 2019,"""Kraftidioten"", a.k.a. ""In order of Disappearance"", is a brilliant 2014 black comedy/vigilante thriller from Norway. Since a lot of people in this world object to reading subtitles (and simply because it's an easy and profitable business), Hollywood is always eager to produce remakes of successful foreign movies. For once, however, I didn't immediately feel like boycotting the US remake; and this for two reasons. Number one: native Norwegian Hans Petter Moland directs the American remake himself and, number two, none other than the awesome Liam Neeson reprises the role of the grieving but vengeful father. Apart from different people in the cast, obviously, ""Cold Pursuit"" is practically a shot-by-shot remake of ""In order of Disappearance. The setting has moved from snowy Norway to snowy Colorado, and the drug wars are fought with Native American tribes instead of with Albanian mafia families, but the plot of the quiet and introvert plow driver seeking retaliation for the murder of his innocent son is identical. This basically means that ""Cold Pursuit"" is still an awesomely entertaining action movie with sublime dry humor, but the freshness and the surprise elements are gone (unless if you haven't seen the Norwegian original, duh).",Cold Pursuit
8,sunwarrior13,Our Late Career Action Hero Liam Neeson In Cold Pursuit Of Murderers,8,23 February 2021,"Our late career action hero Liam Neeson locates himself in the snow and surprisingly in pursuit of murderers of his son in this Norwegian remake of ""In Order Of Disappearance"" as Nels Coxman in this film directed by Hans Petter Moland entitled,""Cold Pursuit"".It tells the story of how Nels,who just got recently got the ""Citizen Of The Year"" award from his ski resort,has his life turned upside down when his son got killed through drug overdose. As when he is about to commit suicide, someone told him that his son was murdered by a drug cartel. This led him in pursuit of the group of men to seek justice for their actions.Evidently, this film is a combination of action and black comedy which makes it something different from a typical Liam Neeson action films. We get to see humor and comic relief along the way especially as Nels hunts down for the murderers,who are more of cartoon villains rather than the typical villains in action films.Overall,it is an enjoyable film as it effectively manages to balance action and comedy throughout making it more than your typical revenge thriller.",Cold Pursuit
9,searchanddestroy-1,Far better than I expected.,8,6 March 2019,"When I read the comments about this movie and saw it was a kind of comedy thriller, I was damn scared to go for it. Because I HATE comedies with crime flicks. But for this one, I must admit that that's the first time in my whole life that I watch a crime movie where humor doesn't spoil, jeopardize the whole substance of the story . Nothing to do with the Guy Ritchie like crap UK thrillers, or even Americans. Plus, in this feature the Liam Neeson character is almost less important than the so many supporting ones who snoop around him; supporting characters whom you can feel empathy to. That's a movie for supporting characters and I love that.",Cold Pursuit
10,CinemaSerf,Seen it all before - only not with so much snow...,5,17 November 2019,"Pretty poor, I'm afraid. Liam Neeson and Laura Dern replay roles that they have often had before - this time their son is murdered by evil drug dealers and Neeson suddenly becomes an expert in vigilantism. Tom Bateman is hilarious - but not in a way Hans Petter Moland would have wanted, methinks. ""In Order of Disappearance"" had little to commend it bar the beautiful scenery and some slightly comedic touches; this remake doesn't even manage that - though the wintry Colorado locations are gorgeous. I guess they must have spent most of the reputed production costs of US$60m on fees and heating, not too much left for the writing. At 2 hours, it is a long old slog too.",Cold Pursuit
11,zardoz-13,"Revenge Is A Dish Best Served as ""Cold Pursuit!""",9,16 February 2019,"Liam Neeson plays a vengeful Colorado snowplow driver in Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland's thriller ""Cold Pursuit"" who clashes with the gang of dastardly drug smugglers that murdered his innocent adult son. Eventually, this bereaved father finds himself caught in a withering crossfire between two rival drug-dealers. The gang that murdered our hero's son screws up royally when they bump off the son of a rival gang boss by mistake. Now, the rival gang craves blood. Not only does one mob want our hero dead, but also another mob tries to rub out the mob that wants to put our hero on ice. Ever since ""Taken"" in 2009, Neeson has starred in several serviceable actioneers about revenge-driven dads and no-nonsense tough guys. He followed up ""Taken"" with ""Taken 2"" (2012) and then ""Taken 3"" (2014). Earlier, Neeson had commanded the movie version of ""The A-Team"" (2010), co-starring Bradley Cooper and Sharlto Copley. He played a former Boston cop in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" (2014), while he was cast as a mobster in ""Run All Night"" (2015).Life in the ""Cold Pursuit"" universe is both desolate and demanding. As the distraught father, our hero Nils Coxman (Liam Neeson) loses not only his son but also his wife. Based on the original Norwegian film ""In Order of Disappearance"" (2014), ""Cold Pursuit"" chronicles similar events, duplicates the same primary characters, but supplements this saga with more subversive humor. The biggest departure for director Hans Petter Moland in his own remake of his earlier film is the narrative global shift from Norway to Colorado. The two heroes--Stellan Skarsgård and Neeson--differ in marginal ways, while the villains are more different than alike. The drug dealer's ex-wife in ""Cold Pursuit"" behaves like Alice in the ""Resident Evil"" franchise. She knows how to yank the words out of her ex-husband's mouth.The aura of gravity in ""Cold Pursuit"" distinguishes it from the typical white-knuckled, testosterone-laden, revenge movie. As he comes to grips with his son's death, Nils Coxman takes the barrel of his hunting rifle in his mouth, snags his finger on the trigger, and is poised to end his life. Nils pauses and then prefers instead to annihilate the fiends who murdered his son to the last man rather than commit suicide. Rarely do we see a mainstream revenge hero contemplate suicide. Charles Bronson would have scoffed and commenced the bloodletting. The passage of her son, Kyle (Micheál Richardson of ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues""), devastates Grace. Drowning in grief from this tragedy, Grace leaves Nils, never to return. Her farewell message is an eloquent blank note. Their marriage collapses, a casualty of the murder. ""Citizen Ruth"" actress Laura Dern, who plays Grace, the hero's wife, doesn't stick around long enough to make a memorable impression. Her role could be classified as a supporting character. The local police investigate. Later, they learn through sources in Denver, Colorado, that Kyle was innocent. Gang leader Trevor 'Viking' Calcote (Tom Bateman of ""Murder on the Orient Express"") and his bloodthirsty henchmen wasted the wrong guy. They gave Kyle an overdose of heroin and left him to die on the street. Naturally, Nils is stunned when the Denver authorities stigmatize his son as a junkie. Refusing defiantly to believe this outrage, our hero embarks on his vengeance-fueled rampage.Nils is a snowplow driver who keeps the roads cleared with a 38-ton vehicle that carves a trench out of the smooth winter landscape, gushing snow like a wood-burning locomotive, as he scrapes through it. He learns from one of Kyle's low-life friends, Dante (Wesley MacInnes of ""Power Rangers""), the names of Viking's crew. Nils tracks them down, and he kills each with his bare hands and brute force. He discovers that killing is a ghoulish business, and death doesn't come easily, when he strangles a thug called Speedo. Just as he thinks he has killed Speedo, Nils learns the creep is still breathing, and he must resume strangling him. Initially, an enraged Viking believes that a rival gang of Ute Indians, who deal narcotics, are to blame. Viking's henchmen murder the son of a Ute tribal chieftain, and they drape his body on a road sign for all to see. This sparks a gang war. Meantime, after he has knocked off three of Viking's men, Nils hires a hit man, the Eskimo (Arnold Pinnock of ""Exit Wounds""), to liquidate Viking. Eskimo takes Nils' $90-thousand to kill Viking, but he treacherously informs on him to Viking. Viking kills Nils' older brother, Brock (William Forsythe of ""Extreme Prejudice""), by mistake. Indeed, Viking knew nothing about Brock's younger brother. It seems Brock hated Viking's father who had run the gang before Viking replaced him. By this time, the vindictive Utes have invaded Viking's turf and assaulted his men. The Utes plan to kidnap Viking's elementary school age son for payback. Before the snow covers their corpses, the two rival gangs have shot each other to ribbons, and our taciturn hero emerges unscathed. ""Cold Pursuit"" concludes with a surprise that will make you chuckle, despite all the murderous mayhem that precedes it.Comparatively, the original film ""In Order of Disappearance"" and its remake ""Cold Pursuit"" are virtually identical. Like Stellan Skarsgård in the original,"" Liam Neeson cannot attach his cuff links without his wife's help. Watching Neeson juggle the two-cuff links uselessly in his hands after his wife has left him later is compelling stuff. The cold, cruel, Colorado landscape and the implacable fury of all three parties struggling to slay each other is off-set by the recurring ironic humor in freshman scribe Frank Baldwin's screenplay. The inquisitive, local female cop that Emily Rossum plays evokes memories of the pregnant cop in the snow-swept Cohen Brothers' crime procedural ""Fargo."" Director Hans Petter Moland leaves much of the killing to your imagination. If it makes millions, ""Cold Pursuit"" could spawn a new kind of revenge thriller where the hero uses larger-than-life vehicles to eliminate his adversaries.",Cold Pursuit

13,neil-476,A comedy? Hardly.,8,13 March 2019,"Nels Coxman drives a snowplough and has just been awarded Citizen of the Year in Keyhoe, Colorado, when his son Kyle is found dead of an apparent careless heroin overdose. Nels goes digging and begins to uncover that Kyle was accidentally caught up in a misconceived attempt to steal someone else's drug shipment.Liam Neeson is Nels in a story which is simple, but with complicated trimmings. The story is cold and hard, with occasional comedic overtones which, to me, felt somewhat misplaced. I see that a number of people have called this film hilarious: despite its occasional lighter moments, it really isn't. Nels is a a sombre man at the best of times, and is set on a course of violent retribution. I didn't find this funny.I did quite enjoy the film though, and the story it tells casts a lot of light on why Neeson chose to relate the personal tale which has resulted in so much criticism.",Cold Pursuit
14,Wizard-8,As fun as trudging through lots of snow,4,26 June 2019,"Although it is possible to combine hard violence with humor, it certainly isn't an easy thing to do. As a director, you have to have an especially steady hand to make sure both extremes compliment each other. ""Cold Pursuit"" tries to mix violence with humor, but the end results don't really work well. To be fair, the movie could have been a lot worse had the humor been more of a yuk-yuk style. The humor here instead is more subdued and subtle, but all the same, whenever it came up it just felt... odd. It didn't really fit with the seriousness and violence elsewhere in the movie. But that's not the only big problem with the movie. The movie, for one thing, unfolds at a really slow and casual pace, making it too long for its own good. Despite running almost two hours in length, there are some glaring plot details that are either not properly explained or simply not explained at all. Also, some characters (particularly Liam Neeson's lead character) don't get enough opportunity to show a background or everything that is motivating them. Why, for example, does Neeson's character almost immediately decide to start on a bloody path of revenge after his son is killed? We don't know, because we were barely introduced to his character before his son's death. The movie has some atmosphere, I admit, and it's far from the worst movie I've ever seen. But in the end, you'll likely forget completely everything about it a few days after watching it.",Cold Pursuit
15,phd_travel,Funnier than Coen Bros and less gratuitous than Quentin,10,1 March 2019,Initially you have to concentrate a bit but soon you will realise you are in a very well constructed black comedy with lots of laugh out loud unexpected humor and situations. Although there have been black comedy violent thriller movies it's funnier than Fargo and not as gratuitous as Tarantino.Liam looks younger than recently. The bad guy Viking is precious. Funniest villain in a while. The Thai wife is stereotypical but hilarious. So many unexpectedly hilarious moments.

16,gradyharp,'Your mother's womb must be twitching in regret at bringing you into the world',7,18 May 2019,"Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland revisits his own Kraftidioten of 2014 with this very brutal film about revenge - a movie that begs the audience's patience while unfolding near countless beastly murders. If taken for what it is, subject matter wise, the film achieves its goal of examination of the extremes to which men can go in the name of revenge.As the official synopsis (a bit enhanced) states, 'Quiet family man and hard-working snowplow driver Nels Coxsman (Liam Neeson) is the lifeblood of a glitzy resort town Kehoe, Colorado in the Rocky Mountains because he is the one who keeps the winter roads clear. He and his wife Grace (Laura Dern) live in a comfortable cabin away from the tourists. The town has just awarded him ""Citizen of the Year."" But Nels has to leave his quiet mountain life when his son Kyle (Micheál Richardson) is murdered by a powerful drug lord. As a man who has nothing to lose he is stoked by a drive for vengeance. This unlikely hero uses his hunting skills and transforms from an ordinary man into a skilled killer as he sets out to dismantle the cartel. Nels' actions ignite a turf war between a manically unpredictable gangster known as Viking (Tom Bateman) and a rival gang boss White Bull (Tom Jackson). Justice is served in one final spectacular confrontation that will leave (almost) no one unscathed.'Spectacular scenery and a sophisticated cast serve as backdrop to this seething serial killing spree. Each murdered victim - all with odd names - is memorialized at the end of the deaths in a manner that helps keep the viewer informed as to the progress of the revenge. Some of the characters are suitably loathsome - in particular Tom Bateman as the racist vicious swine Viking, Michael Eklund as the atrocious Speedo, etc etc etc, while others are so underdeveloped that they practically disappear into the snowy atmosphere. Liam Neeson maintains his quality acting reputation, and that is a reasonable justification for watching the movie.",Cold Pursuit
17,mm-39,Another run of the mill p c film!,6,4 March 2019,"Another run of the mill p c film! Hollywood tries to out P C itself with each new P C film. Regrettably, the P C cultural trend trying to out do each other is becoming redundant, old aka there is no shock factor anymore. Trying to mix a quirky film in the style of, Repo Man 1983, T V series Twin Peaks, and Thing to do in Denver when your dead. The quirky film style is mixing the artistic, and Zainy, into the observed art. The story is revenge oriented, with bizarre stereo type characters. The first half Neeson portrays the hurting man perfectly, with the wife leaving and looking for revenge. Then we have a mix with Fargo style cops, and a John Wick style bad guy, with a group of background P C characters for visionary artistic appeal. The artistic imagery with the strange humor, mixed with a John Wick ending would either be a blah movie or wow. Cold Pursuit is 6 out of 10 meh movie. Like Heavy Metal in 1988, the scene was dying but the industry did not know it. The P C wanting to make a message film award movie is dying. Hollywood needs a reboot or will get hit just like metal did with grudge rock.",Cold Pursuit
18,SimonJack,Violence galore and with demonic gore,4,27 February 2021,"This movie has a huge cast - one of the largest in recent decades with roles that have some dialog. One reason it's so big is that a full two dozen of the cast get killed. ""Cold Pursuit"" is a blood bath of murderous killing. It centers around illegal drugs and their unhuman purveyors of such, with revenge and vengeance driving the entire plot. The film is based on a 2014 Norwegian film set in Scandinavia. Besides being an action and crime thriller, it's supposed to have dark humor in it. But I could see nothing humorous, however ""dark"" it might be.Liam Neeson is the ""hero"" of the film, Nels Coxman. Tom Bateman is Trevor 'Viking' Calcote, an inhumane, demonic-seeming drug overlord. At 67, Neeson was too old to be playing these type of rough and tough action killer movies. They don't take much talent for acting, and maybe he just does it for the money. This bloody and gruesome film isn't for the faint of heart. Nor is it that good. It has a different twist in who goes after whom. While the movie got some favorable reviews for Neeson, most of the public wasn't taken in by the gore. The film bombed, although the Hollywood hype of the movie world doesn't come right out and say such. But the proof is in the numbers. It had a budget of $60 million, and its U.S. and Canadian box office was barely half of that. Its worldwide box office was just $76 million - for a huge loss. The studio or movie company gets about 50% of the box office take, so this film lost around $22 million.The best thing about the film - and it's four stars is its scenic winter shots and some excellent ones of the huge snowplow and snow blower carving a road through deep walls of snow. A close look at scenes with cars following behind the huge machine show the snow walls to be eight feet or higher.The setting for this film is fictional, as is the story. But, anyone who didn't know better and thought this took place in the mountains nearby and in Denver, Colorado, would understandably be wary of ever moving to or living there. The film was all shot in Canada, mostly in British Columbia. The town of Fernie served as Kehoe, Colorado in the film. It's located in the Canadian Rockies about 50 miles north of the U.S. border just above Eureka, Montana. The nearest airport to Fernie is 65 miles away at Cranbrook - Canadian Rockies International Airport.The fancy chateau ski resort interiors were filmed in the Empress Hotel in Victoria. Anyone who has been to the Empress or Victoria will know that there are no mountain scenes from there - just Victoria Harbor outside the front doors. But, on a clear day from Beacon Hill Park in Victoria one can see across the Strait of Juan de Fuca 25 miles to the South and the Olympic Mountains rising beyond Port Angeles, Washington. I've been there a few times, and have also visited and traveled most of the Canadian Rockies.The Canadian Rockies are very beautiful, and Fernie was probably selected due to its snowfall to suit the profession of the main male lead. Liam Neeson's Coxman is the one guy who keeps the mountain road open. That's a permanent job because Kehoe is a major ski destination. The average snowfall in Fernie is up to 30 feet. The average snowfall at ski locations closest to Denver are 10 feet at Nederland and even less at the Vail, Breckenridge and Copper Mountain areas. And the scenery, distances and congestion in that area of Colorado would have made filming winter scenes there nearly impossible - even if they had adequate snow.The landscape would have looked quite different with the urban sprawl that goes many miles in all directions from Denver with its Western backdrop of the mountains. The one direction in which that wouldn't be so noticed would be looking East coming right down form the mountains. The skyline scene shown twice in the movie looks a little like how the Denver skyline might be from there. Another possibility for the skyline might be Calgary, but it's definitely not Vancouver. That skyline drastically changed with the erection of numerous narrow skyscraper apartment buildings with the influx of many Chinese from Hong Kong when that city reverted to China in 1997. Vancouver's skyline since the early 21st century looks like a city scape with many needles pointing into the air.Even with the scenic shots, I can't recommend this film. The gore, brutality and mindless killing hardly could be entertaining to anyone. The rating could use an ""X"" with the ""R"" for the violence and demonic overtones.",Cold Pursuit
19,FeastMode,poorly made and pretty pointless,3,21 September 2019,This wasn't garbage. i was enjoying it for a while. but it went nowhere and got worse as it went on. some of the acting was bad. the villain was awful. the story was kind of nothing. so much in this movie is completely useless. so many side-plots should be removed.

20,Robert_duder,An interesting attempt to translate a Norwegian film,7,31 May 2019,"Usually when a foreign film gets remade, it gets very much ""Westernized"" to the point where it retains nothing from it's original source or style but I have a feeling (I haven't see the original) that Cold Pursuit tried to retain some of that feel from the original Norwegian version. It is a vengeance film but it's far different than Taken or any other of Liam Neeson's recent action films because it has a very specific style and it's got that vibe to it of an independent film more than anything. That doesn't make it bad, or good, it just makes it different than what a lot of people probably expect. It was a little slower than I thought it would be, a little darker and a little more dark humor than I expected too. If you watch it from a certain perspective it has some genuinely funny (albeit very morbidly) funny moments. Liam Neeson's character is anything but a ""bad-ass"" . In fact he's just a guy pushed to the brink by the loss of his son and someone who knows the area around him better than anyone else and then he has the luck of mistaken identity throughout most of the film. It's gritty and violent and hard to watch and then it's a little bit odd and over the top at the same time. I'm not sure how Cold Pursuit did financially but I could understand if it didn't do as well as his other pictures because this one is a very distinctive style. But if you want something different and really like Neeson than you can be sure this will wet your whistle. 7/10",Cold Pursuit
21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Tonal shift.,4,28 February 2019,"'Cold Pursuit (2019)' doesn't know what it is or, even, what it wants to be. It has so many story and, more importantly, tonal issues that it's difficult to engage with, ending up as a 'comedy-thriller' that isn't funny or exciting. It seriously feels like an indecisive, slapdash compromise between two totally different cuts. This is strange, though, because it's, as far as I can tell, pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of a 2014 Norwegian film directed by the same guy. Still, it's not too crazy to assume that the original cut of the thing was either far more comedic or far more thrilling and some studio-head or other busybody stuck their nose in. Either that or the screenplay wasn't that great to begin with. Whatever the cause, the final result is a mess. You can tell that it's trying to avoid the cookie-cutter 'revenge movie' clichés that Neeson himself is so familiar with, but it ends up playing straight into them, as well as amalgamating them with tropes from a number of other genres. It also does them somewhat half-heartedly, as they never amount to the end product that they usually do. What I mean is that tropes are only tropes because they're seen in several similar works, which is usually because they successfully do what they set out to. Here, the tropes remain but their intent is lost - especially the ones that are, essentially, genre-less - which means that they don't provide their genuine - if, perhaps, at this point played-out - narrative worth. They just stick out like sore thumbs. A lot of pictures suffer from this problem and I'd even go so far as to say that 'generic' experiences only get labelled as such if they're both generic and generally sub-par, as you can be very 'by the book' and still deliver a solid - even standout - product. In this case, I feel as though the issue perhaps comes second, but also contributes, to the flick's fluctuating tone, which is by far its most egregious aspect. I don't want to keep going on about it but it really does prevent you from getting on-board with the story, highlighting its other issues and resulting in a rather dull time overall. If you're wrapped up in a narrative, you'll often be able to overlook its stranger turns or wobbly structure. Here, this doesn't happen. Even while you're watching, you just scratch your head at some of the stuff it tries to get away with: non-sequiturs, weak-characters, nonsensical plot-points, lax character-motivation, uncomfortably dark undertones and moments of pure absurdity. It's a shame, too, because there is potential in various aspects of the affair. Generally, the concept isn't bad and its juxtaposition of grisly violence and dry humour ought to work. In the end, it just doesn't. 4/10",Cold Pursuit
22,ThomasDrufke,Not What I came For,5,18 February 2019,"Even in the worst of Liam Neeson action/revenge movies, there are some redeemable qualities. Cold Pursuit is perhaps the most stylistic of the half dozen or so revenge films he has done, and sadly it's on the weaker side of the quality meter. There's many reasons for that, but perhaps the most notable is that this really isn't Neeson's film at all, it's far more of an ensemble film than anything else. Where the first 30 minutes or so are thrilling and surprisingly funny black comedic satire/revenge, the rest of the film is a convoluted ensemble with ties to drug cartels and an overall war among gangs, with Neeson just caught in the middle of it all. Too many plotlines, without enough character development, and you have a disappointing ""action"" thriller. If only it kept up the pace of the first 30 minutes.5.3/10",Cold Pursuit
23,Cineanalyst,Taken Meets Fargo,4,3 November 2019,"The raison d'être of ""Cold Pursuit"" seems to be that Americans, or perhaps other English-speaking people, too, won't bother with a foreign-language movie. A remake of the recent Norwegian ""In Order of Disappearance"" (2014), also directed by Hans Petter Moland, there seems to be no other purpose for it other than to translate it to English and to cast a Hollywood star, Liam Neeson, who will be more familiar to the intended audience (sure, Stellan Skarsgård, the lead in the Norwegian original, was in some MCU burgers and whatnot, but he doesn't have similar star-drawing power in the states). The one interesting difference, part of which was unintended, is how the movie plays into the persona of Neeson. His career has largely been replaying the same role for over a decade now, since ""Taken"" (2008). Surely, the makers of ""Cold Pursuit,"" however, didn't intend for the picture to become a footnote with Neeson putting a damper on the revenge-plot spectacle with his interview admission of his real-life past and racially-charged revenge plotting.Regardless, ""Cold Pursuit"" is an odd mix of dark comedy with the usual beat-'em-up between Neeson and the baddies. Even without Neeson's admission, it seems this might've spelled the end for this part of his career. It's hard to go back after your character persona has entered self-parody. Indeed, the ""Taken"" sequels, at least, as well as such fare as ""Non-Stop"" (2014) and ""The Commuter"" (2018) are worthy of mockery, but they didn't mock themselves, as ""Cold Pursuit"" does. Unfortunately, it's not very funny, although Tom Bateman makes for an appreciably over-the-top slimy villain. This isn't on par with similar efforts by the likes of the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino. It's no ""Fargo"" (1996) despite how much it seems intended to be just that. Perhaps, that's also because the dramatic action is effective whereas the comedic elements aren't. Take out the dark humor and ""Cold Pursuit"" is one of the more punchy ""Taken"" retreads starring Neeson.",Cold Pursuit

26,The-Sarkologist,Liam Neeson kills somebody in this scene,7,10 February 2019,"Sometimes I wonder whether Liam Neeson will ever appear in a movie where he isn't going out and killing people. Then again, a part of me really doesn't think so because he just seems to play these characters so well. This movie is a case in point, though here he is basically a guy that drives a snow plough for a living, and has also been awarded with the honour of citizen of the year. Well, things seem to be looking up for him, until it turns out that his son died of a heroin overdose.
'But he doesn't do heroin!', is the stock standard cry, and the stock standard response is that he didn't really know his son all that well. Maybe that is the case, maybe it isn't, because he soon leans that no, he really didn't know his son all that well, but his suspicions were also correct in that this overdose was a little suspicious.
Well, what happens is that we get the Liam Neeson that we know and love, and that is the one that goes out seeking revenge against the perpetrators of the deed. Honestly, when some small time henchman tells Liam Neeson to mind his own business, and flashes a gun at him, you pretty much know that the small time henchman has made a pretty big mistake, and this is certainly the case here.
This thing is that this film is actually a black comedy, though like a lot of similar films, it isn't one of those laugh a minute films, but there are some absolute pearlers in it as well. The other thing is that there is a lot more realism to this film than meets the eye. Not surprisingly, when the henchmen start disappearing, the suspicion doesn't fall on to some unnamed vigilante, but rather a rival drug group that operates near by, a group that apparently there is a deal with. Of course, going off half cocked like they did does eventually cause some serious problems, and results in a pretty large body count.
Yeah, that is the other thing about this film, and that is the body count. Basically, whenever somebody dies, the name, and a symbol representing their faith, appears up on the screen. However, it is more than that because at the end, instead of the characters appearing in order of appearance, they are in order of disappearance. So, this is a movie about people leaving, disappearing, and never coming back. It is a movie about loss, and coping with loss, and further more, this isn't some extraordinary person who manages to defeat all of the bad guys, but just a normal man, who is angry and upset, the type of character that Liam Neeson plays so well. The other thing is that he isn't the person who solves everything, but rather through his actions, sets a series of events in motion, but then again he isn't the only one who does that, because all of the actions don't occur in a vacuum, but rather set in motion a series of events through which they quickly lose control.",Cold Pursuit

The photography is a plus, and like ""Fargo"", ""Cold Pursuit"" lends a chill in July with the frigid atmosphere. Then there is the supposed ""Dark Humor"", which seems unnecessary in many instances, and comes across mostly as forced. All this adds up to a rather redundant, not believable bloated story. Liam Neeson is fine as the Father bent on killing those drug dealers responsible for his Son's death, but there are constantly new characters added to the plot, which do little except expand the running time or sidetrack to the supposed ""dark comedy"".

30,cruise01,A boring revenge film with a plot that has been done before but adding dark awkward humor.,5,9 February 2019,"Cold Pursuit (2.5 out of 5 stars).Cold Pursuit is an action revenge type of film that has Liam Neeson out to get even with drug dealers that got his son killed. Yes, Liam Neeson is back in an action role that he typically plays and another revenge story that has dark humor thrown into the mix and interesting characters. Sadly, the film does not add anything new to the revenge story. The plot is boring with Liam Neeson killing any drug dealers responsible. A few sub plots involving drug dealer leader Viking (Tom Bateman) and his perspective of battling for custody of his kid and living a strict diet and a high maintenance life. And another sub plot involving an American Indian and his group of man going to war with Viking cause they accidently killed their man. You got two factions battling with each other and Liam Neeson after Viking and their men for killing his son. Has been done before and the plot is not anymore interesting.The film is filled with a lot of dark humor and awkwardness. It does have some fun hilarious moments. And than there are a lot of cheesy and pure stupid awkward moments that the director found funny but it is just annoying. Lots of scenes over playing a moment of watching characters waiting for the elevator to lift them. Or looking at a dead body trying to figure out what to do. I did find Viking played by Tom Bateman to be interesting as the villain. Living a high maintenance life, a strict diet which he is punishing his son to follow it too, and his arrogant dumb personality was just amusing.Liam Neeson was decent playing Nelson. Tom Bateman delivered as the bad guy. Laura Dern and Emmy Rossum were very much underused with their characters. Dern playing Nelson's wife and is distant with her husband. Rossum playing a local detective and her partner are always several steps behind trying to connect the dots with the drug dealers in their town.The direction by Hans Petter Moland was just boring and stupid. Feels like he is trying to be the next Quentin Tarantino. Having out of place music playing which is trying for laughs. There was barely much action to even be entertained.Overall, Cold Pursuit is a pretty bad film. The plot and direction are long and boring. The humor had its hit and miss. Most of it was missing out on being funny which was just awkward and stupid. There are way better revenge thriller films out there than this.",Cold Pursuit

This film has its fair share of moments as it does combine different genres as people may categorize this as a dark comedy.There is a lot of violence and much of it is done in a more humorous way as opposed to being very serious. The body count death cards were a nice and clever touch. The lead villain seemed far too over the top and with a bad American accent it was very noticeable that he was disguising his voice. This film was less than two hours in run time but felt quite lengthy. It got quite boring in the end and the finale didn't live up to the hype.

32,eddie_baggins,An uneasy mix of genres make this a cold affair,4,18 August 2019,"Forever to be known as the film that changed its star Liam Neeson's career forever, after an unfortunate interview with the well-liked star overshadowed the film before it was even released, leading to a large-scale backlash against Hans Petter Moland's bitingly dark black comedy/thriller, Cold Pursuit is an odd beast that would've came and disappeared with very little fanfare regardless of the notice it gained with Neeson's misstep.A remake of the 2014 Norwegian film In Order of Disappearance, Cold Pursuit is a strange hybrid of Coen Brother's like black comedy, straight up revenge thriller and gun-toting actioner set in the unique surrounds of snow-capped surrounds of small Rocky Mountain town of Kehoe, where Neeson's grieving snow ploughing father Nelson ""Nels"" Coxman seeks vengeance on a bunch of drug dealers in the wake of his son's untimely drug-related death.None of Cold Pursuit's elements or abundance of characters, that include a collection of native Indians, generic drug goons lead by Tom Bateman's hammy turn as crime head Trevor 'Viking' Calcote and some seemingly dim-witted cops come together in any real shape or form with fans of Neeson's Taken persona sure to be disappointed by the fact the late action bloomer is relegated to a more supportive turn as the film continues to push forward with its bloody tale of vengeance and unlikable people.Trying to be a moulding together of genres hurts Cold Pursuit's chances of connecting on any real level with the humour more forced than natural, the violence more grizzly than entertaining and the splattering of characters barely getting a chance to breathe or evolve as the run-time wears on meaning we are always finding it hard to care about their various plights or activities even if you know somewhere deep down lies a truly entertaining and oddball delight.The setting is certainly there, the story is in many ways generic but had potential to be a thrilling yarn, while the actors involved such as the recognizable Laura Dern, Domenick Lombardozzi, John Doman and Emmy Rossum all could've delivered the goods had they been given the chance to but Moland (whose responsible for the brilliant and criminally under-seen Terrence Malick backed A Beautiful Country from 2004) fails to ignite his wind-swept and snow-filled outing with the heart, energy or creativity needed to make it really shine.Final Say -More than likely a completely different film than you expected when you first heard about it or saw the trailers, Cold Pursuit is a film with ample potential that's only ever slightly met. An odd mix of genres that never truly gels, Cold Pursuit is a film not worth venturing out into the cold for.2 fantasy football discussions out of 5",Cold Pursuit
33,leonblackwood,Another typical Neeson movie! 5/10,5,2 February 2020,"Review:
Whenever you see that Liam Neeson is playing the lead in a movie, you know exactly what to expect! You know that your going to get revenge and action, with Neeson kicking butt, and that he will eventually save the day, which is exactly what happens in this movie. The director chose to make a black comedy, which was a weird chose because the subject matter is quite serious. I know that the movie was a remake and that the director wanted to stay true to the original, but I think the mixture of genres didn't work with Neeson in the lead. With all of the controversy surrounding the film, after Neeson spoke out about personal issues that were close to his heart, I was expecting something special, but it turned out to be pretty mediocre. I found the baddie, Trevor ""Viking"" Calcote (Tom Bateman) annoying, but Laura Dern (Grace Coxman) put in a good performance, even though she wasn't in the film for long. Neeson (Nels Coxman) puts in his usual ""action hero"" performance, but we get to see another side to his persona when he spent some time with the little boy. Anyway, after snowplough driver, Nels Coxman's has been awarded ""Citizen of the Year"" by the fictional ski resort of Kehoe, Colorado, his quiet life is disrupted when his son dies from a forced heroin overdose. Nels wife Grace leaves her husband in grief. He is about to commit suicide when he learns that his son was murdered by a Denver drug cartel. He decides to seek vigilante justice, makes a sawed-off rifle, and kills three members of the cartel, dumping their bodies in a nearby river. The cartel's psychopathic leader, drug lord Trevor ""Viking"" Calcote, first suspects that these deaths are the work of his rival White Bull, a Ute with whom he has so far avoided conflict. Viking has one of Bull's gangsters murdered, not knowing it is White Bull's only son. This drives White Bull to seek ""a son for a son"", and he orders his men to kidnap Viking's young son. Nels seeks advice from his brother Brock (William Forsyth), once a mob enforcer known as ""Wingman"", and learns about Viking. Brock tells Nels that killing Viking requires a hired assassin, and he recommends a transplanted African American hitman known as ""The Eskimo"". The Eskimo agrees to kill Viking for $90,000 but decides he can get another $90,000 from Viking by informing him that ""Coxman"" has hired him for the hit. Viking doesn't appreciate the Eskimo's ""lack of professional ethics"" and kills him. He thinks the Eskimo meant Brock Coxman, and he takes Brock for his ""last ride"". Since Brock is dying of rectal cancer, he claims responsibility for the hits to protect his brother. Viking tries in vain to stop the gang war by using one of his own men as a scapegoat and sends White Bull the man's head. This is insufficient to placate White Bull, who shoots the messenger. Meanwhile, Nels kidnaps Viking's son from his prep school before White Bull's men can, in order to draw Viking into an ambush. Nels treats the boy well and protects him from the violence to come. Nels identity is revealed to Viking by the prep school's janitor. Though promised $10,000 for the tip, he too is killed after his disclosure. Will Nels survive and get revenge from his son? Will Viking get his boy back and kill Nels? Will White Bull get revenge for his son, by killing Viking? You have to watch the film to find out! I didn't really see the point of the cops, who added more confusion to the plot, and I couldn't see why Grace (Laura Dern) was so upset with her husband, but apart from that, I did find the movie to be quite unique. Personally, I wouldn't have chosen Liam Neeson to play the lead because he has done this concept to death, but with that aside, it's still a watchable movie, even though we all know what to expect. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Hans Petter Moland, who also brought you Aberdeen, United We Stand, The Beautiful Country, Pedersen: High School Teacher, A Somewhat Gentle Man, When Bubbles Burst, In Order of Disappearance, A Conspiracy of Faith and Out Stealing Horses. Personally, I haven't heard of any of his previous movies, so I can't say if he is a good director or not. If I was to judge his work by this movie, I would say that he certainly has a warped sense of humour and that I appreciate how hard it must have been to produce because of the horrendous weather. In terms of the plot, he could have taken the easier root, by streaming down the script and the characters, but he chose to ram everything together, which made it feel a bit messy at times.Budget: $60million

As the movie opens, Coxman, who operates a snow plow business, is getting ready to accept the Kehoe (Colorado) Citizen of the Year award.

At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: ""Cold Pursuit"" is a remake of the 2014 movie from Norway called ""In Order of Disappearance"", and when I say ""remake"", I really mean ""replica"", in that this is an almost note-for-note remake of the original. When ""In Order of Disappearance"" came out in the US (in 2016), it was billed as a ""comedy"", and that is was, albeit a very dark, if not black, comedy. Sadly, only part of the dark/black comedy tone remains in ""Cold Pursuit"", as the US remake is more of a straight forward revenge film, this despite the fact that for the US remake the original Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland was retained. Liam Neeson is as reliable and formulaic in his latest action movie role as he is enjoyable. Laura Dern as the grieving wife and mother pretty much disappears from the movie after the initial opening 15 minutes. And while the setting in the Rocky Mountains certainly isn't bad, check out the original setting in northern Norway instead... In fact, when all is said and done, I'd readily encourage you to check out ""In Order of Disappearance"" to get the full flavor and context of what the movie really wanted to convey.""Cold Pursuit"" opened wide this weekend, and the Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely. Mind you, it's not that ""Cold Pursuit"" is a bad movie per se, but when you get down to it, it's yet another case of a Hollywood remake that really feels pointless, given that the original was perfectly fine (""The Upside"" vs. the original ""The Intouchables"", ""Cold Pursuit"" vs. the original ""In Order of Disappearance, etc. etc.), but of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Cold Pursuit
39,subxerogravity,So it comes out that Neeson is racist while promoting his greatest film in years,7,13 February 2019,"This is one of Liam Neesons best efforts. So good that I hoping he's is not racist like the promotions for this movie seem to make him out to be for some remarks he made. All men of every race, creed and color love Neesen including black so I'm really hoping this it not true, especially because this is one of his greater films.It's funny as hell. Almost poking fun of his action movie persona, Neesen plays a father whose son was killed by drug dealers and he goes on a mundane killing spree to seek vengeance.The slow quiet burn of action is quite fitting to the backdrop of a small ski town where people go to relax and smoke weed, and to make up for the lack of things getting blown up or dudes getting blasted in cool gun fu like sequences, the absolute humor that Neeson goes after these dudes with is absolutely fantastic.The movie is filled with intresting charaters in a set up that reminds me of Tarantino (Or John Wick Like on level three (which I would not think I would like until I saw this movie)Just when Neesen has got his game face on we try to bury him.

40,jtindahouse,A unique action movie with a great villain,8,19 April 2020,"'Cold Pursuit' is a very good movie. Sadly it was marred by controversy prior to its release (see Liam Neeson's comments regarding revenge he once sought) so we may never get a proper indication of just how much the general public liked it. But in a world where most action movies, and in particular Neeson's action movies, were beginning to feel all very much the same, 'Cold Pursuit' is refreshingly unique.In fact unique is a really good word to describe this film. Just when you think you've worked out the tone it is seeking it will hit you with a curve-ball and catch you off-guard. The villain in this movie is terrific, played excellently by Tom Bateman. So few villains get it right in film any more. They either have too much menace and not enough charisma, or two much charisma and not enough menace. Bateman finds a perfect balance.Oddly Laura Dern is in this film, seemingly for no reason. When I saw her appear I thought that her character must have something important to do with the story. Apparently not though. A very odd cameo considering the incredible 2019 she had. Neeson is doing Neeson things in this film, much as you'd expect.

This is a different type of Liam Neeson movie. It's got action and comedy and Liam is not in his normal tough guy persona. FYI: I also heard that Liam has said that this movie will be his last action movie role-I hope not, but that's what he has said. This movie is based on a 2014 Norwegian film called 'Kraftidioten'-which was renamed 'In Order of Disappearance'-and it was directed by Hans Petter Moland. Hans directs this remake, too. Liam plays a snowplow driver in a quiet resort town that has just won the citizen of the year award. He is married to Laura and they have a grown son. The son gets mixed up in a drug deal gone bad and ends up dead. This is where the movie differs from Liam's usual roles. Of course, he wants revenge-like any normal person would-but he is not a cold blooded killer. He has read novels though and thinks he can take care of business like they do in the books but there are humorous attempts of his trying to be a bad ass. Tom plays the bad guy drug lord and William is Liam's brother that tries to help Liam understand what he is getting himself into. One thing I thought was interesting and different was whenever someone would die, the screen would go black and the dead person's name would appear-it was pretty funny when there was a massacre and the whole screen was filled with names.
It's rated ""R"" for strong violence, drug material, language and sexual references-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.
I enjoyed it and if you want to see Liam in his last action role, then you will probably enjoy it too. I would buy it on DVD.",Cold Pursuit

45,CubsandCulture,One of the Better Liam Neeson kills a bunch of bad guys movies,8,17 May 2019,"Neeson has made this type of film like 15 times. Indeed on the DVD for this film there is a preview for *another* Liam Neeson kills a bunch of bad guys film. That is probably the major downside to the film. It is pretty much exactly what you expect from the trailer in terms of plot. Neeson's character is indistinguishable from the other 14 (or whatever) grieving parents seeking revenge he has played over the last few years. The supporting characters are all stock types as well.But for all that the movie is highly entertaining. It has a irreverent sense of humor and the film knows it is schlock. There are a few very, very clever and funny gags running through the story-the main one is how ludicrous the nicknames get for the bad guys. And the film has a Pulp Fiction like dialog in places. The film sort of reminds me of a lesser Bad Times at the El Royale from last year.The setting-a wintry landscape-was a nice change of place. And the director gets the most of the settings natural beauty.This was a very fun film.",Cold Pursuit

The villains try to be Cool & have ""Clever"" & ""witty"" banter & dialogue but it's all forced, unfunny & bizarre.
The Acting is horrendous off of everyone except a frail & old looking Neeson & a Cool bit part for the great William Forsythe, everyone else was terrible & corny.
Neeson plays a devastated father out to hunt & kill the Criminals who killed his son, basic stuff but not done well, Neeson is still the best in this film but he seems like a side character really who gets lost in all the bits & pieces that go on with the Criminals & the silly unfunny Cops of the small town that's snow filled & Neeson is the snow plow guy, he does a couple of good kills but again is lost in a stupid set up that wants to have odd characters & be like ""Fargo"" but none works & it all just feels weird & not entertaining. The characters are crap.

49,kluseba,Gritty,8,1 March 2019,"Cold Pursuit is a remake of the Norwegian movie In Order of Disappearance. While I usually dislike Hollywood remakes, this film is a quite positive surprise.The director of the original movie was also given the chance to direct the remake and it is obvious that he has put all his creativity, heart and soul into this project.The locations have changed from Norway to the United States of America but manage to be quite similar since the film takes place in the wondrous winter landscapes of Denver and Kehoe in Colorado.The lead character seems to be a perfect role for Liam Neeson who plays yet again a quiet family father with a thirst for revenge. He stars alongside other great actresses and actors like a particularly emotional Laura Dern and a versatile Tom Bateman who incarnates an unpredictable psychopath.The conflict between arrogant white drug dealers from the big city of Denver and calmer yet equally deadly First Nation members from the remote winter resort of Kehoe adds some depth to the movie in form of a socio-critical undertone that shows how white men have mistreated First Nations for centuries.Cold Pursuit also convinces with a shot of black humour and even some situation comedy. The former can be witnessed in form of the names of deceased characters that appear on screen during the movie and in the credits to pay homage to the title of the original film. The latter is exemplified by the memorable performance of Elizabeth Thai who plays a particularly angry, domineering and headstrong wife who overprotects her husband.The movie only has a few minor negative elements which are related to the plot. It seems unlikely that the leader of a drug cartel kills the son of a long-term associate but potentially dangerous opponent based on a few vague assumptions. The fact that the lead character kidnaps the son of the drug cartel leader and carelessly drives around with him is also a headscratcher. The fact that the final confrontation is poorly prepared by the lead character despite his murderous objectives is also surprising to say the least.If you are able to ignore some strange plot twists and at times illogical character development, you will enjoy a gritty tale of revenge with excellent actresses and actors, equally enchanting and sinister locations and a particularly elevated death count. Even by Liam Neeson's gloomy standards, this is one of his most brutal films ever and certainly not a movie for the whole family. Cold Pursuit is the movie to watch during this harsh winter season.",Cold Pursuit
50,Pairic,Effective Black Comedy/Thriller,8,16 March 2019,"Cold Pursuit: Nels Coxman (Liam Neeson) is a snowplough driver, keeping the ski resort town of Kehoe connected to the rest of Colorado, happy in his existence until his son Kyle turns up dead, apparently from a drug overdose. But it turns out that his son fell foul of drug pushers and was murdered by them due to to a friends stupidity. Kyle's mother Grace (Laura Dern) has a breakdown from the strain of his death and the increasingly odd behaviour of Nels. Coxman is out for revenge and kills his way up the gangster food-chain in search of the big boss who ordered the hit on Kyle.Nels shows great flair as he strangles, shoots and beats his opponents to death and disposes of their (chicken-wire wrapped) bodies in a river gorge. The big boss, Viking (Tom Bateman) believes that a rival gang is responsible for the disappearance of his dealers and declares war on White Bull (Tom Jackson). The gang war ensues as Nels continues his crusade with the help of his ex-mobster brother Brock (William Forsythe). While a strain of dark humour runs through the film, Viking's young son Kyle (Michael Richardson) provides some light relief as Viking's goons try to sneak treats to the boy in defiance of the strict diet imposed on him by his father. Kyle also helps the gang members with Fantasy Football. Emmy Rossum is Kim, a Kehoe cop who wants to bring Denver style policing to the town but is never quiet on top of the fast moving affair.Some great scenes of the Rockies and the approaches to Denver look otherworldly by day or night, in sunshine or snowstorm. A snowplough makes a mighty weapon when it's opponent is just a car. The film has elements of an old Western about it as the ""Cowboys"" gang goes to war with the ""Indians"" gang but whilst it is a Gangster/Revenge Thriller it is also very much a Black Comedy in the mould of Fargo. Director Hans Petter Moland delivers an effective remake of his 2014 Norwegian film In Order of Disappearance (Kraftidioten), at least matching the quality of the original. 8/10.",Cold Pursuit
51,masonfisk,NOTHING COLD HERE...!,9,20 February 2019,"If not by the harebrained verbal antics by Liam Neeson as he hit the press blitz for this film, Cold Pursuit would've been singled out as one of his best & quirkiest action outings of his late stage career renaissance. Now unfortunately this film will forever be remembered as the one where the lead actor nearly stomped a person of color 40 years ago & why oh why did he need to lend voice to this inner musing is beyond most intelligent people of the upright variety. Neeson plays a snow remover in Colorado whose son turns up dead (labelled as a druggie) from an overdose administered by a drug cartel who believes he & his fellow airport employee friend stole a kilo of coke from them. Right when you think Neeson is about to go into Takenland, the film surprisingly veers left than right than left again, sustaining an uncertainty heretofore unseen in an American outing (it is based on a Norweigian film named In Order of Disappearance, currently on Netflix...end commercial) since Tarantino decided to stake his cinematic banner for all to see. Doing what I feel Martin McDonagh (In Bruges/Seven Psychopaths) has continually failed to do, Pursuit feels organically left field leaving the audience in a perpetually giddy state of flux which serves the material like gangbusters.

Using stunning copious snowy vistas against the spectacular Colorado mountains is as much a character as the warm (and cold) bodies. Keeping things toward a simple noir story without bombast sews it up as Neeson plows (pun intended) his stock-in-trade character. At times I was reminded of Fargo and Snatch, two films I enjoyed immensely. This is layered with some heavy stuff combining elements of crime lords, American Indians, and ineptitude of the local blue and whites. There is sly black humor laced throughout which hits but doesn't try to run with Tarantino. You can, for once, believe in Neeson's character with the ridiculous surname.

One by one lots of 'em are brutally murdered in a trail of cold destruction, all marked on the film by whimsical headstone intertitles. The Law is always a few miles behind and frozen out, as personal justice is meted out and gratuitously snowballed; Do-gooders would state even such icy characters as drugs barons have a right to life and justice, but really?

60,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Cold Pursuit,6,16 February 2019,"2019's Cold Pursuit is my latest review. Released in February, it's a glacial weather film that embodies plenty of snowdrift and stars Liam Neeson. Yup, it's that time again. It's Neeson time.So OK, ""Pursuit's"" ending seems to be an amusing glorification of death and dying. And yes, Cold Pursuit doesn't know whether it wants to be a black comedy, an exploitation conch, or a mordant B-movie. Still, ""Pursuit"" is much better than Neeson's last winter release titled The Commuter. I can assure you of that.Cold Pursuit contains quick-stinted violence, a Lauren Dern character that fades out early, nominal plot buildup, and an accurate locale in Central Colorado. In truth, if you like your movie villains having cheesy one-word names (""Viking"", ""Avalanche"", ""Wingman""), then ""Pursuit"" is your cinematic baby. And if you like your flicks as frat boy drinking games when the bodies pile up (take a swig of whiskey every time someone dies and you'll be totally hammered), Cold Pursuit will help you get your veritable swerve on.Directed by Norwegian Hans Petter Moland and using title cards for every casual persona who bites the proverbial dust (I'm not kidding), ""Pursuit"" involves snowplow driver Nelson Coxman (a subdued Liam Neeson). When Coxman's son winds up dead from a heroin overdose, he has his doubts. Later on, Nelson finds out that his boy was killed by drug dealers prompting him to go into ""half nelson"" revenge mode (ha-ha).Of note: Cold Pursuit doesn't really have many ""special skilled"" action sequences. It's just hit-men-style kills and there's lots of them. If you think you've gone in to see Neeson's Taken as a revved-up snow-blind version, you've bought the wrong ticket. And if you think Neeson plans on going Chuck Norris on everybody, you've been plainly mistaken. Oh and I almost forgot, Liam Neeson disappears halfway through ""Pursuit"" for about 20-25 minutes (as do a lot of the other underused characters at various points in time). It's almost like his name shouldn't have even been top billing on the poster.All in all, Cold Pursuit has helmer Hans Petter Moland trying to one-up films like Wind River, Smokin' Aces, and 1996's Fargo. His direction is rather stylish, there are a few entertaining moments, and the script by Frank Baldwin (he's a rookie) provides a few juicy one-liners. Still, I gotta say Moland's nonchalant mixture of humor and savagery left me a little ""cold"". Yeah, I'm going with a rating of 2 and a half stars.",Cold Pursuit

(R)Snowplow driver Neeson lives a quiet, simple life, but when his son is killed from a forced drug overdose by some shady goons, he steps out on a vendetta for vengeance. Remake of the Norwegian film, ""Kraftidioten,"" from the same director; on the surface, just another in the recent line of Neeson's grudging middle-aged action hero pictures, but it's sharper than most, closer to a riff on the nihilistic, twisty Tarantino-esque crime flicks from the 90s than a glossy-but-grim Euro-thriller. As a crime thriller, it's pretty standard stuff; as a comedy (notably of the gallows persuasion), it's pretty enjoyable, though it lacks either the grace or the audaciousness to really pull it off one way or the other. Neeson can play this kind of role in his sleep at this point, though one does wonder how this seemingly mild-mannered family man is able to pull off fatal operations with such easily-acquired skill and moral indifference.57/100",Cold Pursuit
64,arungeorge13,Made me laugh more than I'd expected it to! [+59%],6,10 May 2019,"The thing with most Liam Neeson actioners these days is that their screenplays solely depend on his tough guy demeanor to keep the proceedings engaging. Cold Pursuit, another Liam Neeson actioner on the onset, is entertaining but for reasons not pertaining to the set pieces alone. Don't get me wrong, the set pieces are very much there but this film doesn't go the typical Hollywood remake route.While I haven't watched the Norwegian original (In The Order of Disappearance; the name choice a lot more suitable for the film), it sure seems like the material writer Kim Fupz Aakeson and director Hans Petter Molland (who has directed the remake as well) had in hand was worthy of a re-telling. While there are some sly remarks made by baddie characters in the film that are sure to turn some sections of the viewers off (in fact, in-your-face offensive at times), everyone who does so eventually gets the 'treatment' they deserve, which was satisfying as hell.The crude humor takes a while to arrive, as the incident that sets the storyline in motion is a grim one: the son of a snow-plow operator is found dead during a snowy winter in Kehoe and he decides to find out who's behind it. More characters are unveiled, while some begin to 'disappear'. A title card with the respective character's name shows up every time a 'disappearance' occurs (innovative!). I couldn't help but laugh out loud at instances such as the 'Coxman reference' joke, the whole 'Eskimo' scene, and of course, the 'motel' scene. You'll know when you've watched!And yet, amid all that, you have a brilliantly written scene featuring Nels (Liam Neeson) bonding with the chief baddie's son in a ""Tell me a story so that I can sleep"" situation. It does its bit in showing us that even as Nels goes about enacting his vengeance, he still has a heart that yearns for the son that he lost. The climactic showdown is executed well and ends on a rather 'unexpectedly funny' note. I know of Neeson's 'racist' comments and the controversy surrounding it, but I can't deny the fact that his performance was pretty good in this movie, as he always gives a 100% even when the scripts offered to him are mediocre.It's easy to write off 'Cold Pursuit' as cliched, predictable action-drama, but the clever undercurrent of dark humour does the trick at least for some of us. This film was very much in Tarantino-Coen-Zahler territory (minus the subtlety, of course!). I adore both Emmy Rossum and Laura Dern, and am of the opinion that they should've had better-written roles in the movie. 'Cold Pursuit' meanders a bit in its storytelling and is indeed more fascinating in fragments than as a whole, but you can give it a watch if you're a fan of black comedies.",Cold Pursuit

69,Troy_Campbell,Eccentric ball of fun.,7,15 February 2019,"At first glance this looks like just another Liam Neeson revenge flick. Neeson plays a stoic, no-fuss kinda guy who gets all kick-arse-y when his son is murdered by a drug cartel. But it doesn't take long for this unorthodox murder-fest to reveal there's more than meets the eye. Based on his own 2014 Norwegian film In Order of Disappearance, director Hans Petter Moland's storytelling style is clearly influenced by the Coen brothers, Quentin Tarantino and the McDonagh brothers. It's a slippery movie, zigging and zagging between genres with an unpredictable plot, idiosyncratic characters, and a tone that veers wildly as the macabre content is often portrayed in a humorous manner. There are laughs, but they're all uncomfortable. It's visually interesting too; not just because it's set in a heavy snowfall region on the outskirts of Denver, but also due to Philip Øgaard's curious cinematography. He shoots the snowy scenery to look equal parts beautiful and frightening. Neeson seems to relish the opportunity to play against what has now become his type, his avenging father here makes mistakes, fumbles his way through the vendetta, and noticeably feels the physical and mental exhaustion of it all. Shout out to Tom Bateman as well, his Native Indian elder White Bull is a poignantly contemplative presence - whilst also being an extremely violent drug kingpin who is arguably the most vicious of the lot. It doesn't all land perfectly, and it certainly isn't for everyone's tastes, however Cold Pursuit is a quirky ball of fun that features moments of brilliance side by side with moments of bafflement.",Cold Pursuit

You have to see this movie. Watchable for action and thrills. As me movie has many favouring sides those are: Location of the story i.e. snowy atmosphere which gives a different look to the story. Another point is that credits are shown only for particular character gets killed whenever. It looks more interesting than watching all credits at a time. Acting side is mentionable for Viking (Tom Bateman) who plays erratic businessman cum mafia don and careless farther of a pretty son. He played his role significantly and very impressively.

In more skilled hands this could be an excellent film, but the direction, editing, and continuity are so shoddy that it looks like a college film.I found myself thinking ""Hey that can't happen"" too many times to recount.Putting aside these technical aspects, there is also a thread of black humor and sometimes just plain lame humor that detracts from the central theme of the film.

Still, I think the mix of ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" and winter time violence made me an enthusiastic viewer of this film. It looked like stupid cheesy fun. It is stupid fun for sure but it does well with comedy and having a pretty interesting revenge plot driving the film.The film is about a snowplow driver in Kehoe and his discovery of the death of his son from a ""heroin overdose."" This death seems unlikely so he investigates and realizes a drug dealer nicknamed Viking is behind his sons death. He slowly kills off Viking's mean while also getting mixed up in a war between Viking and the local Native American cartel. Film obviously stars Liam Neeson but also stars Tom Bateman, Liam Neeson, and Laura Dern in a small role (she just flipping disappears).The film feels a bit like Fargo, obviously because of the snowy setting in a small town and the crime that also involves the local police department. Neeson is no stranger to this type of role, a fatherly figure who has been wronged and then takes revenge on the wrongdoing party. I think the film does well enough to also build up the villain and go in depth into the background of him and his rivalry with the Native Americans.I liked the black card every time someone in the film died. The film gets a little loose with its plot as it goes along. I must have missed it but I swear Laura Dern's character gets written off somewhere. Also, the final conclusion leaves a little to be desired. Otherwise, its a fairly comedic but stylistically violent remake of its Norwegian predecessor. A fun time at the cinema.7/10",Cold Pursuit

The plot was just OK. I would have liked more action.
It's not one of the best movies with Liam Neeson.
I've seen better movies with him.",Cold Pursuit
80,RforFilm,Cold Pursuit is the Liam Neeson parody that combines Coen brothers-style storytelling with Tarantino-style pacing,7,13 February 2019,"It's the January/February season, which also means it's time for a certain gravely-voiced actor to make another action movie we've been seeing around this time for a while. Yep, it's Liam Neeson time. Some people might see him as a one-note actor who plays similar characters in most of his movies. You'd be right if you were just referring to his recent revenge movies like Taken or ""thriller on a mode of transportation"" movie like Non Stop or The Commuter. You could even make that argument with his comedic roles like The Lego Movie or dramas like Schindler's List.While I won't go as far to claim that Liam Neeson is one of the greatest actors, I do put him in the same category of similar actors to John Wayne or Jimmy Stewart who are more or less playing variations of their personas. You don't see them to slip into characters, but more for them in a different situation. No actor should be ashamed about this and should even be thankful they have fans that come for this. Even in a bad movie, I still like Liam Neeson and what he does in his movies. That's why it's nice to see him make fun of himself and his movies in Cold Pursuit.Snowplower Nelson Cox (played by Liam Neeson) has just been awarded citizen of the year while enjoying his happy life, happy wife, and happy son. But then his son is found dead of a heroin overdose. Despite Nelson's pleas that his son wasn't a drug user, the police find no evidence of foul play and rule it a suicide. Still, Nelson feels that something fishy is going on and discovers from a friend that his son was the target of a mafia hit. Once he figures out who it was, be becomes a vigilante and kills off several people to get to the leader.Mafia head ""Viking"" (played by Tom Bateman) becomes angry (and this is a hotheaded villain) and mistakes the killer coming from another Native-American mafia within the same town. They eventually instigate conflict and a mafia war, while Nelson continues to axe off more people. It eventually leads him to a point where he kidnaps Viking's son in order to draw him out...and the gang...and the other gang...and the local police as a war of confused sides come together just to figure out whose angry at who.I'll say right away that while this has the plot of a standard thriller that seems tailor made for Liam Neeson; that because it is and is proud of it. In fact, this is more of a parody of those Liam Neeson movies that come out around this time. Cold Pursuit takes a lot of those elements, like the tough leading man with a combat background, an eccentric villain, a family member he's avenging, and even the use of a transport machine as a plot device (in this case, a snowplow), and put it into a movie that made me laugh at the dark elements that are typically easier to write in dramas.What helps Cold Pursuit is two things. First is the tone, which seems like a mix of Coen brothers cinematography and Tarantino-style editing and storytelling. This brings up a lot of side characters that are usually sidelined in a lot of Liam Neeson movies. The main villain is delightfully over-the-top as an angry, yelling hothead, the Native Americans play off as wise while seemingly insane, and even some of the mafia goons get their little personality quirks that make them more then just throw away bad guys. There isn't much to Liam Neeson himself, who is basically the straight man to all the chaos.I think that Liam Neeson would have to know at this point that his characters have gone through the same scenario so many times, that playing it up as a parody would only make sense from this point. Cold Pursuit is an example of how that can take up that idea and make a parody without it becoming too silly. This is a dark comedy and because of that, I can see this as being an acquired taste. Some may want an action with a more engaging story and some may want a comedy with more jokes. I say this is a happy marriage that isn't great, but rather simply remains a fun ride.I'll give this seven snowplows out of ten. Other then those wanting a more unconventional comedy, this is also for those that like Liam Neeson and the movies he makes around this time. Even the title Cold Pursuit should tell you right away what your getting into. Go see it and get angry enough to take this ride.",Cold Pursuit
81,carbuff,"Would rate higher, except I've seen the far superior foreign film it was based on.",4,8 December 2019,"""Cold Pursuit"" was based on the Norwegian film ""In Order of Disappearance"" and suffers from the usual Hollywood. Characters are simplified, stereotypes are amplified, sets are puffed-up, the pace of action is stepped-up too much, and so on. If I hadn't seen the original film and known what a sharp, moody, black comedy it was, I wouldn't have known any better, and I would have probably rated this a star or two higher. As it is, ""Cold Pursuit"" is just a pale and disappointing reflection of the film it is extremely closely based upon (not quite a frame-by-frame remake, but close enough and bad enough to be a total waste of time). When you consider how good the original is, and how comparatively lame this copy is, do yourself a big favor and pass on this one and watch the first one instead. You won't gain anything from this remake, and there are so many better ways to spend two hours.",Cold Pursuit
82,bankofmarquis,Didn't quite succeed in what it was trying to do,6,1 March 2019,"Liam Neeson has stated that COLD PURSUIT is going to be his last action film. And, if that is the case, he certainly picked an interesting one to go out on.Based on the Norwegian film KRAFTIDIOTEN and Directed by the same person (Hans Peter Moland), COLD PURSUIT follows snowplow driver Nels Coxman (Neeson) who's son dies of a drug overdose. It's not long before Coxman uses his ""certain set of skills"" to settle the score.And that is how this movie was marketed (taking advantage of Neeson's past 10 years of action hero status) and that is too bad for those who are going into this film expecting a ""standard Neeson kick butt revenge action flick) are going to be disappointed, for Cold Pursuit has parts of that, but it also has an element to it that is going to take some getting used to - it's ""Norwegian sense of humor"".To say this film is a ""Dark Comedy"" does not do it justice, for the comedy in this film (and there IS comedy) is so rooted in the violence and action of the proceedings that, at first, the audience does not know how to react to it. By the end, it is clear that this is a comedy - and I wished that it would have worn it's comedic elements just a little more on it's sleeve. But then, I guess, I would be missing the point of what makes up the ""Norwegian sense of humor"" - oddity and subtlety. And this film IS odd from the setting (a remote ski resort village outside of Denver) to the warring drug gangs (city thugs vs. Native Americans) to the lazy Sherriff and laid back townspeople to Coxman's hippy, drug addled wife (Laura Dern). It is an odd assortment of people and circumstances, but not quite as add as...say...Twin Peaks.And that's what hurts it. It IS a subtle film with subtle humor and subtle quirks, but (at times) is TOO subtle for an American audience that is used to being hit over the head with themes and quirks and violence.One who is NOT subtle in this film is Neeson as Coxman. He brings the rugged, dependable man of action that one has come to expect during his action-hero phase. Also not subtle (not by a long-shot) is Tom Bateman as the main bad guy, Viking (they all have nicknames) who telegraphs that he is a bad guy by being over-the-top, doing everything but kicking a puppy and twirling his mustache.Domenick Lombardozzi as Mustang (one of Vikings' henchmen) and Tom Jackson as White Bull (leader of the Native American clan) find the right line between subtlety and over-acting and ground this film (for the most part). The rest of the cast (including John Doman and Emmy Rossum as the town Sheriffs) flit through this film, uneventfully and uninterestingly, neither adding nor detracting from the events. Only William Forsythe, as Neeson's shady brother and Elizabeth Thais (as his wife Anne) manage to rise above things in the limited amount of screen time they are given. And, finally, Laura Dern is wasted in an underwritten - and under-performed - role of Neeson's wife.I can hear Director Moland screaming to his cast ""Less, less...give me less...no more...More...MORE!!!"" and the result is an uneven film that is underplayed too much in some ways and overplayed WAY too much in others. And this is too bad, for he had an interesting concept going, he just didn't execute it (at least not with this group of performers) very well. I'll be interested in seeing the original Norwegian film, KRAFTIDIOTEN, to see if it worked there.Letter Grade: B- (for I applaud what it was trying to do)6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Cold Pursuit

86,bob-the-movie-man,Comments on revenge are best kept on the screen.,6,15 March 2020,"I'd completely forgotten the furore about Liam Neeson's comments back last February during the press-tour preceding the film's release. In discussing the destructive feelings of revenge experienced by his character, Nels Coxman, Neeson revealed something he did 40 years ago: after the rape of a friend by ""a black man"", Neeson went out on the streets to find another ""black man"" and do them harm. (As a fellow Ballymena-born man, David Moody (from the ""Mark and Dave"" blog) has an interesting theory about this... that it was not a ""rascist"" statement in the true sense, but something else entirely. See the link on One Mann's Movies).The comments undoubtedly impacted the movie at the box office. Which is a shame. Because in his catalogue of bonkers and violent revenge-adult flicks, this is one of Neeson's more entertaining ones.Revenge is a dish best served cold. And where colder to serve it than in the ski-resort of Kehoe where Nels Coxman is the local snowplow operative and ""man of the year"" for his services to the community. But the tracks are about to fall off his orderly life. For his son Kyle (Micheál Richardson) winds up dead through a drugs overdose and his strained marriage with wife Grace (Laura Dern) disintegrates. (One of the most cutting and best-written ""Bye"" notes ever seen in the movies).With revenge in mind, Coxman pursues the Denver-based drugs lord Trevor Calcote (Tom Bateman) who dished out the drugs to his son. But he inadvertently manages to stay just below the parapet as he sets in train a gang war between Calcote and a Kehoe-based native-American drugs gang led by White Bull (Tom Jackson). The snow turned progressively pinker as the body count rises.Calcote (aka ""Viking"") is painted as a colourful family man, with an annoyingly bright son Ryan (Nicholas Holmes) that he controls with a rod of iron. Viking is estranged from wife Aya (Julia Jones), who seems completely unafraid of him and happily embarrasses him in front of his men. This relationship never really works. Since given all the terrible and irrational things Viking does to people, whether they obstruct him or help him in equal measure, putting a quiet bullet into Aya's head seems to be to least he could do!Where there is fun to be had is in the ""Stockholm syndrome"" linkage between young Ryan and Coxman. When his father insists on controlling his diet, feeding him the same insipidly healthy meals morning, noon and night, the alternative of being kidnapped and fed burgers seems eminently more preferable!The film is at times really difficult to follow. There are lots of inexplicable leaps of logic and really inexplicably bonkers scenes that you can only patch together later. It's as if the filmmakers randomly filmed 5 hours of footage and then tried to edit it all into a cohesive plot!As one example of this, the relationship between Coxman and ""Wingman"" (William Forsythe) was poorly introduced such that I was left baffled by a later plot twist.In another scene, Neeson smashes the head of enforcer ""Santa"" (Michael Adamthwaite) into his steering wheel, but in the next scene collapses with him utterly exhausted in the snow. There was clearly a significant fight here that was cut out of the finished cut. But as a result the final cut makes no sense at all!Of course, the local law enforcement team are average at best. Average because although young and keen-as-mustard detective Kim Dash (Emmy Rossum) is hot on the trail of the truth, her partner Gip (John Doman) is f*ckin' useless... wanting to do nothing but drink coffee and eat donuts in true Simpsons style.Normally with these sort of films, it's difficult to keep track of the body count. No such problem here. Every death is celebrated with a tombstone graphic so it's easy to keep count! Needless to say, there are a lot of tombstones registered.Directed by Norwegian Hans Petter Moland, it's all good violent cartoonish fun, that keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek for most of the running time. The snowy setting, the partly native-American cast and the presence of Julia Jones brings to mind the truly excellent Jeremy Renner / Elizabeth Olsen movie ""Wind River"". But there the similarities (and quality levels) definitely stop. It's not a clever movie; it's borderline bonkers for most of its running time (never more so than with a totally bizarre ""joke"" final shot); but it is entertaining. As a 'park brain at door' action comedy it just about makes the grade.",Cold Pursuit
87,silvermistvio,Cold but it's amazing.,7,10 May 2019,"Cold Pursuit is a different from those films and very difficult to review. I don't know about the others, but as for me, this film is like it's name, it's kind of cold. I love Liam Neeson. I mean he's a great actor. I almost watch all of his films he ever made. That's why I watched this one too. And I love all of his films. So, this one is one of those.Still, there are things I like and I don't. First, I love the way of showing the credit names after their characters died. And also when the film's finished, that credits list showing ""in order of disappearance"", I also love it. It's kind of different from the others. I love how they chose to show.Another thing I like is Brooks Coxman. He knows who is responsible for all of that and also knows how Viking is bad. Yet, he didn't say anything to betray his brother while the Eskimo took Nels' money and betrayed him. I kind of admire Brooks. I wish I had such a brother. As for Eskimo, he really deserved to die for his betrayal. Took a job, especially, the money and then went to Viking for more money and betrayed Nels? That's the worst thing that is someone has ever done. So, I'd say he really deserved to die.In the nearly ending scene, the White Bull is afraid of Nels would harm him. It's understandable. Because he's a drag lord, he has reason to point a gun without much thought. But I think later, he realised that Nels wasn't that kind of guy, he dropped his gun. It's like he trusts Nels. I also love that scene.About Brooks' girlfriend, I don't understand why she spat Brooks' grave. The director put that scene to show that woman's character? And also I don't understand why Grace chose to leave Nels after their son died. I mean the reason why their son died wasn't even Nels' fault. But I love the fact that Nels didn't try to find her and bring her home.Too bad that Nels didn't have a chance to kill Viking. If he could, it'd be better. And also it doesn't have amazing actions. If there were, it'd be great.I feel like the film should've continued. I mean we all know how it's going to end. Ryan gets home and happy with mother. (As for me, I'd still like him to stay with Nels, like Nels got another son.) It kind of became a bad ending for having that kind of ending scene. At least one person of White Bull should be alive. And how he died was kind of sad and also disgusting. They should have chosen another way of dying.All in all, although this film is a little bit cold, but it can be said a good film to enjoy. And yes, the plot is a little plain, but I've seen the worst. I feel like no matter how cold, no matter how plain, as long as Liam Neeson is in it, the film is automatically turned out into a good one. Hence, it was totally spending time. I really can't wait to see more of his films.",Cold Pursuit

But this movie would have been better if they had , at least offered some back story about the son. I could care less he was killing off all these people because I knew nothing about the son. It was obvious he didn't either due to Laura Derns comments and her leaving him. I did laugh at a lot of it but I don't think that's how the filmakers were intending it to come across. Liam , however still looks like a bad ass annd that saved the utter ridiculousness of most of the movie. But comedy. No. It may have been funny in parts but I don't believe that's what they were aiming for. Could have been decent if they had written a better script and there was better character development but there wasn't. Probably why I fell asleep and that's the gist of it.

92,MrDHWong,An entertaining vigilante film with most of the usual enjoyment that can be had with Neeson in the lead,7,7 February 2019,"Cold Pursuit is an action thriller film starring Liam Neeson. Based on the Norwegian movie ""In Order of Disappearance"", it is an entertaining vigilante film with most of the usual enjoyment that can be had with Neeson in the lead.In the snowy Colorado town of Kehoe, Nels Coxman (Liam Neeson) works as a snowplow driver clearing the roads for passing motorists. One day, Nels' son Kyle suddenly dies from an apparent heroin overdose, despite him not having any history with drugs. Suspecting foul play, Nels decides to take matters into his own hands to find out what was really responsible for killing his son, and inadvertently becomes involved in a bloody feud between two violent gangs.With Liam Neeson as his typical one-man-army self, Cold Pursuit is a fast paced action fare with an interesting enough story to move things along nicely. Although Neeson is the film's lead actor, it is Tom Bateman as the film's main antagonist who steals the show in every scene he is in. His sleazy, unhinged performance was so unpredictable that it was always intriguing to see what he would do next. The one main problem with the film is that it does not balance its comedy and drama that well. Normally with black comedies like Fargo or In Bruges, there would always be solid comic relief to counteract any scenes of brutal violence or emotional severity. Unfortunately, this film is only sporadically funny, and this lack of humour makes the serious moments feel harsh and unpleasant. This may come down to the way the story has been adapted from its Norwegian source material to suit American audiences, as some of the film's Scandinavian quirkiness would have likely been lost in translation. With that said, Cold Pursuit is still worth seeing for fans of Liam Neeson effortlessly plowing through his enemies by himself (pun intended).I rate it 7/10",Cold Pursuit
93,Alexander_Blanchett,Too many loose ends,7,5 March 2019,"It was entertaining most of the time but I couldn't quite appreciate the tone the film had. What I did appreciate was the dark humor which worked perfectly but there was something weird or unlieal about the movie which I did not like too much. In the end it was a typical Liam Neeson revenge flick, with less Liam Neeson than usual. I saw the original and liked it way more as there the mix of thriller and dark comedy worked better. Which is strange as it was also directed by Hanns Peter Moland.
Liam Neeson was in his typical mode, added a little more to the character than usual but still fine. Laura Dern had unfortunately just a very small role and disappears after the first third of the film. Tom Bateman made a decent villain... sometimes a bit too overacted but it fitted the role nicely. Nice to see Emmy Rossum getting some work again, she actually developed well as an actress. It was a very good performance, better than during her earlier years.

97,statuskuo,Dark Comedy Action Done Right,7,16 February 2019,"Saddled with a terrible title this movie a surprise comedy done in that frosty Nordic tongue in cheek, you either will cringe at or embrace. Infinitely more tolerable than say...""3 Billboards..."" which many may compare it's grim small town revenge tale, this movie has very little point but really paints the villain as...relatable. Why? Because he is a cold brutal man who retains the arrogance and youthful triggered anger of the Gen-Xers (I am one, so I would know). A spoiled man-boy who weighs down his middle school son down with the discipline he most likely lacked. He seems to be the father he seen in pre-internet t.v. but also reared by GQ. Conversely, Liam Neeson is the blue collar dad who seems to be haunted by his past (which frustratingly is never answered). Laura Dern plays his wife who believes him to be a good man, but one devoid of passion. On the day their son is murdered in a botched drug smuggling moment, he had no part in, Neeson goes...well...Neeson.
If you're expecting ""Taken"" his character here seems much less refined. The only link to a modern world is thru his brother played wonderfully by William Forsythe. The rest of the time Neeson just wants to eat deer stew and keep snow plowing.
This mundane life is sort of lost in the violence. Which could've played for deeper laughs as the trailer indicated. As it were, the structure seems to favor a more ""3000 Miles To Graceland"" understated behavioral nuttiness rather than Hollywood-ized tropes.
Still, it feels like there are missing scenes. Much has to do with Neeson's random murders. Open ended henchmen deaths always frustrate me. Yet, the buoyancy of the film relies on its absurdity. A snowplowman avenges the death of his son when he discovers his murder was at the hands of a drug dealer whose deeply embedded in a drug business at a resort town but becomes also entangled in the feud with Native American turf war.

To make matters worse, it's almost a shot-for-shot remake, offering next to no deviation or difference compared to Moland's first effort. Even the runtime is exactly the same, so you can only wonder how much thought went into this pointless exercise. Basically, movie tries to replicate the ironic tone and deadpan delivery of Coen Brothers film like Fargo, with some Tarantino-inspired mayhem thrown in. But the result is more often childish than witty. It is the combo of dark humor and violence where the movie never quite reaches a balance. Not to mention that, ""Cold Pursuit"" is different from other Liam Neeson revenge films by the fact that it is a parody of the genre. Tom Bateman, as drug lord Viking, overacts to such a degree that his scenery presents more of a threat to life and limb than a snowplough driver with a grudge. That said, ""Cold Pursuit"" didn't really work for me. I think the problem is that the filmmakers spent so much time trying to parody Neeson's films that they didn't consider that the majority of those films are themselves already parodies.Rating: 6+/7- Just because I like Liam Neeson",Cold Pursuit

Surprisingly this thing is actually a black comedy hidden within the confines of a action flick. Neeson actually even takes a step back from the story as different subplots unfold one of which includes the involvement of a Native American drug cartel. The action is as usual with a Neeson flick and the comedic moments lighten up the story. Was great to see a favorite of mine William Forsythe make an appearance as well.

when you compare All liams revenge flicks with real family/loved ones revenge movies like Death Sentence, the stranger inside, old boy, the Crow, Gladiator, mad max etc etc.
Liams movies just fails to deliver something truly great. After watching this all i can think of what happened to Emily rossums career? I think she's one of the Most beautiful actresses in the whole world. Yet only one great movie with her, phantom of the opera. What happened?? If you compare her screen beauty with todays super famous leads like Emma in la la land or other crap. She is by far then thousand times better. And prettier to look at.

112,DuskShadow,Another Hit by Liam,7,7 October 2019,"Though I will say this, I was constantly getting the feeling that this was secretly written or directed by Quentin Tarantino. There were so many little gags that nearly flew under the radar, obvious gags, the way it was shot from scene transitions and the in between narration as if by cue card. At times I honestly thought this was a comedy, or at least a dark comedy. Maybe it partially was. BUt to see Liam in another hit like the first two Taken films, was pleasing to me. And something about being in a cold, desolate snow blind environment always attracts me. Perhaps due to me living in such a place for a short while. It had that Insomnia feel to it. But with drug involed gangsters abounding in the film, especially due to the way they talked and acted, I thought this took place on the east coast instead of in Colorado. Regardless, this was one of those movies to enjoy with some friends and have a few brews while viewing. 7/10",Cold Pursuit

114,TheHonestCritic,"""Cold Pursuit"" deserves a cold reception!",2,14 February 2019,"""Cold Pursuit"" (2019), starring Liam Neeson. There have been a lot of garbage movies coming out recently. A lot of remakes, reboots, (WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ORIGINAL IDEAS?!) However, I noticed for this film, that the critics and fans gave this movie a mostly positive reception. So I thought, ""why not go see it? This movie can't be that bad, it has Liam Neeson in it!"" I was completely wrong, this is one of the worst new movies I've seen so far this year. The whole time, I almost kept dozing off, honestly. The plot was confusing, the locations are especially boring (I HATE SNOW!), the soundtrack sucked, and even the acting was dull! The only good thing in this ""movie"" are the special effects, which isn't saying much. Good special effects are usually a given in modern movies and shows. The acting was abysmal, not even Liam Neeson could save this ""movie"". Just do yourself a favor, skip this ""movie"". Watch ""Taken"" (2008) instead, which is Liam Neeson's best movie in my opinion. What a waste of time ""Cold Pursuit"" is, but what do you expect from most modern movies? Also, this is another example of a movie with a bad cast of actors (EXCEPT FOR NEESON), and a bad movie mixed together. They probably knew that this ""movie"" was going to suck. So they somehow got an A-list actor like Liam Neeson to be in this ""movie"", in order to lure movie goers into the theater, and we fell for it. On an unrelated note, there's a scene in the ""film"" where Liam Neeson's character is trying to kill himself, hmmmm. I wonder if that was really part of the ""movie""? Or, was Liam Neeson actually trying to kill himself thinking of how bad this ""movie"" was going to be? I hope it doesn't ruin his career! Overall, I give this ""film"" a 1 out of 5 star rating. So that means my IMDB rating will equate to 2 out of 10 stars. On a final note, whenever I went to the theater to watch a new movie, I would check out reviews from ""professional"" film critics to see how they rated the movie. As I already mentioned, this ""movie"" somehow got positive reviews! How on Earth did that happen? I just said: ""I'm done, I can't rely on critics anymore. They're afraid to be honest with their reviews!"" That's actually one of the sparks that helped ignite this club page in the first place. So there is one positive thing that was salvaged out of this ""movie""; this club page. Bottom line: don't waste your life watching this ""movie"", and just ignore the ""real"" film critics.",Cold Pursuit

It was not that... at all (well on paper it is). In fact this one feels like it is a borderline action. The movie moves a bit too slow for it to be a typical revenge action movie.If the movies Fargo and Smoking Aces had a baby Cold Pursuit would be the result. I spent the entire movie thinking, is this a gangster movie? Is this an action? Or maybe a dark comedy? I started to find the title cards to be funny but there is little in the rest of the movie to lend to it being a dark comedy. The characters are introduced and disposed of in one way or another so quickly that I didn't really care what happened to them.And yet I found myself somehow entertained by this oddball that is and isn't and action/comedy/drama.

119,movieman6-413-929510,The new Liam Neeson action thriller is a bit weird and filled with dark humor.,5,22 February 2019,"Cold Pursuit is a Remake of the Norwegian film Kraftidioten (In Order of Disappearance). This remake is directed by Hans Petter Moland, the same director who directed the original Norwegian film.
The film is set in a luxurious ski resort in the Rocky Mountains. Here the quiet house father Nels Coxman (Liam Neeson) keeps the winter roads clean and clear as a snow clearing house. He lives with his family in a comfortable hut away from the tourists.
When his only son is murdered by actions that the powerful drug lord Trevor 'Viking' Calcote (Tom Bateman) is responsible for, Nels leaves his quiet life behind and armed with vengeance armed struggles with the entire drug cartel.
Hans Petter Moland makes with this new film a larger and more violent version of his original Norwegian film. He has made the film more entertaining for fans of action thrillers. Unfortunately, in the film they do make the mistake of putting Liam Neeson's character in the background of the film at a given moment in order to bring Tom Bateman more of his character and his accomplices. They do this in an attempt to give the viewers more information about the criminals, but unfortunately these scenes only make the film a bit tougher and you hope that Liam Neeson will be back in the movie as soon as possible to get the criminals back on brutal way to attack.
This film is actually more of a dark comedy than a real action thriller, because the ways in which Liam Neeson kills his enemies is done in a brutal but comical way. Furthermore, the film is also filled with separate but also comical moments.
Because of the leading role of Liam Neeson in the film, this film passes through the story and location as a mix of two other Liam Neeson action thrillers, namely Taken and The Gray. Liam Neeson again delivers good acting in the film, but this is not his best acting. He also acts more in this film just to earn money with it.
Thanks to an interview that Liam Neeson has had for this film, in order to promote the film in this way, Liam Neeson and the film have come to a bad light. In this interview Liam Neeson said that he was on a wreck trip 40 years ago, looking for a random dark man, to kill it. He did this because a friend of his was raped by a dark man. Because of this information, Liam Neeson was declared a racist. Liam Neeson has apologized and further denies that he is a racist.
The rest of the cast put the criminals who play them further down in a standard way and sometimes only know how to provide some comical moments.",Cold Pursuit

Not worse, just in a rougher style.But it would not be so scary if, creating a film based on an existing story, the author would change/add something of his own ...and not just corny copy everything ""from start to an end"".So, generally, this is just a copy, but made in a rougher American manner.",Cold Pursuit

I also must admit that this version is not that bad. Reading in comments below I see viewers being surprised by quirky and dark humor (normal in Norway/Scandinavia and most of the Europe), which is understandable knowing that most Americans don't even know that anything exists outside their ""star spangled banner"". So, this version is OK but not much more than that. I'm glad that it kept the original director, although it's obvious that American producers had the final (and first and middle) word. Suggestion: watch the original from 2014 (don't know how to read subtitles in English?

Nels knows his son was not into drugs and goes after those involved.I don't know what kind of film was used but it so clear, sharp and wonderful to look at all the scenes in here it almost reminds me of a pastel kind of photography. (You and your obsession with pastels!) You almost forget about the story the photography is so awesome and mesmerizing, sort of. You'll see.Yes, Nels goes after the persons most responsible for his son's death, but then things slow down and we see a more complete story with the bad guys, the police and the Indian tribe. Viking believes the killing of his men is the work of Little Hawk, son of Chief White Bull (Tom Jackson) and he hangs him on a sign near the reservation and blames one of his men on this killing and decapitates him and offers him as a peace offering to Chief White Bull.So now all parties are engaged. Let the games begin....................Notables: Laura Dern, as Grace, Nel's wife; Emmy Rossum as Officer Kim; John Dorman as Officer Gip, Kim's partner; William Forsythe as Byron, the Wingman, and Nel's brother who tells Nels how dangerous Viking is; Julia Jones as Aya, Viking's ex-wife; Dominic Lombardozzi as Mustang, Viking's right hand man; Nicolas Holmes as Ryan, Viking's son and Nels kidnaps Ryan to have Viking come to him.The scenes with Nels and Ryan are quite touching.All in all a good story not dominated by Liam Neeson as a character that goes after everyone as he did so often in his other movies. But very enjoyable because many other entities are brought into play. However, if truth be told we like it the other way when Liam Neeson's characters go all out to right the wrongs. See?

All though, it does take quite some time-I'd reckon about thirty to fourty-five minutes in-to get serviceably invested in its display, once you calibrate into the gist of it all, it becomes a chortling flurry of quippy chatter, gratifying carnage, and husky shipments of pathos.Cold Pursuit is a self-aware, keenly improbable ""vengeance/battle of the cartels spoof"". It's defintely one of the best entries in the unofficial, Liam Neeson searches for the men who killed/kidnapped his wife/daughter/son/ paycheck saga.

134,Lewis_Heather787,So much potential !,6,15 February 2019,"This film had the potential to be something really great but some really strange and bizarre decisions in this film have made just ok at best.For example you've got an interesting story at heart, a basic revenge tale of a father going after the guys that killed his son. Then you mix in some underground drug gangs, some tribal stuff and police investigations here and there, you end up with a pretty good foundation for a fantastic crime thriller. Oh yeah and not to forget but one of the greatest actors in Liam Neeson doing what he does best, and a pretty good ensemble cast around him. I dunno were my expectations from the trailers to high??? Because I was really let down by this film.1) The first major problem: The VillainNow I don't think I've ever heard of the actor who played the main villain of ""Viking"" in the film. No its not all his fault because the director and writers do bare some responsibility as well but my god was the portrayal terrible, even laughable at times. The character stood out for all the wrong reasons, he was a cartoon character, thats not what you want from your main villain. For me I never took the character seriously which meant that there are no stakes at risk and its not menacing or frightening.2) Second major problem : DialogueSome of the dialogue across the board was a bit choppy here and there but thats to be expected in a film like this but some of the dialogue for the villain ""Viking"" especially was just bad, it almost makes you cringe at times. It makes me wonder what on earth was the director going for with this direction, I just don't get it.I think all in all I was partially expecting something completely different to what I saw. I was expecting a fierce, tense crime thriller with great action and an interesting story with complex characters. I suppose I got one maybe two of those parameters I thought I was gonna get, I got the interesting story and some good action.Its just a bit of a let down because I was hoping that this film would be great, because it had everything going for it. There are some parts I really like and enjoy, the cast for the most part are really good, Neeson obviously stands out. The parts I liked the most never really got enough attention they deserved. Would have loved to have seen more of Laura Dern and the husband/wife relationship with Neeson after their sons death, but no she leaves and thats it. The police investigations and finding out about the drug related deaths was really good but it was short and sweet, I was left wanting more of Emmy Rossum's character. Also after each character dies there name comes up on screen is a really cool idea that really worked. So there is a lot there that I really liked the look of but never got a chance to see any of it fully fleshed out.
Lastly I would say is get rid or change the timing and placement of the humour in this film because its all over the place and at some really bizarre times.Overall its 60% out of 100 or 6 out of 10, its ok but it had the potential to be something much much more than that. Unfortunately nobody will see this film because of Neeson's recent comments which is a real shame, not for the film's sake but for Neeson's.",Cold Pursuit

I laughed out loud at many scenes. It is surprisingly stylish and well-written, about a small step or two down from Tarantino. All of the actors are great, even the lesser-known roles like the actors who play the Indians.If you are looking for just pure entertainment and enjoy the crime genre, then you can't go wrong with seeing this.

I was going to type he could do this in his sleep, actually I think he does this in his sleep. It must be in a contract that he has to avenge a death in every film he appears in. Here he goes through his usual quizzical, vacant look while delivering next to no dialogue. When they show his dead son, he looks like he is at the local butchers who is showing him a prime cut, there is no emotion. Early on the woefully under used Laura Dern, tells him ""You will have to speak"" he uses all his dialogue on his speech as citizen of the year. I always think you need to dispense a little logic when watching a movie but here we have a man who drives a snow plough living in a mansion in a ski resort and who at the drop of a hat finds 90K to hire a hitman? The Eskimo {hit man} is that stupid to go and try to extort money from a drug gangster while surrounded by half a dozen of the drug gangster's hitmen? You can go into a bridal shop with a sawn off {no cameras?} and shoot someone and drag their body to your car and no one notices? The baddie is straight from Scooby Doo he is that over the top, I expected him to say, ""darn it you pesky snow ploughman"" The film wants to be a quirky Pulp Fiction type of black comedy but lacks the wit and dialogue to go that route and it is not even funny.

Firstly it is a very good film but....
Secondly there is quite a lot of action sequences, I hate it when people say that a thriller or an action movie is violent, it's not it has action scenes in it.So why the buts.. and the title to my review? Well it is because the film has humour in it. Yes this film is not played straight which I found took some edge from the film, hence my title review.I think it should have been played straight, I know the original one is not either but I think thus version should have been played straight and it would have been up there with Taken but because of the humour contained in it, to me it played as a just okay, Fargo style movie.Neeson was excellent in it but to me, he would have been better in a straight laced film.",Cold Pursuit

It's basically Mr. Plow getting revenge. There's even some humorous moments put in, especially with the first kill. After he kills one, we see a black screen with a cross and the characters name. Pretty creative.I was hoping the film would end a certain way and it didn't. In the end, it's a Liam Neeson action movie and I love it.

Tis a wintery film this, with bevy of ingenious end of life moments ranging from snow ploughs, to road signs, to glorious pine trees. Comedy noir anyone? ""Cold Pursuit"" adds that perfect blend of tangy spice to what could have been another paint by numbers revenge caper, giving perfectly cast, stone cold Liam Neeson enough comedic angles to dupe sympathy for a mechanical vigilante.Though several interesting subplots are buried deep in the snowbanks, ""Cold Pursuit"" succeeds in that Coen Brothers style of delivering equal doses of terror and yuks, often simultaneously.Highly recommended, or at least it would be, if this hadn't already been done before, and better, by the same director no less (""In Order of Disappearance""), but with the caveat of distracting subtitles.

148,somf,Odd year so far at the movies for me.,6,11 February 2019,"This was my third film in the theaters this year. But my second American remake. I don't like when the haters come out and diss American remakes, but I am going to kind of do that here. I much preferred the original in this instance. But there are probably 2 major reasons for this. The director of this film also directed ""In Order of Disappearance"" , the source for this film. So using the same director did not give the film any original twists. It was almost identical to the first. Same shots, different actors. The second reason is that the new film is set in Denver, my hometown. But man is it a fictional Denver. So that may be unfair.
Since I gave the original 8 stars, maybe going into this film with no expectations from having seen the first would have raised my rating. I love Liam Neeson, but Stellan Skarsgard is also an excellent actor and maybe played the role just a little better.
By the way I also saw the Upside which was a remake of what I thought was a fairly mediocre French film, but I am in the minority there. I loved the Upside and feel that the American cast was far superior to the original.",Cold Pursuit

""Cold pursuit"" is full of action, fun, beautifully shot, with the icy landscape to be the protagonist and darkly comic moments. The Moland's joy of carnage and black humor keep the film intriguing from start to finish and it is always entertaining, even when it seems unsure what it's aiming for. However, it just doesn't deliver the same thrills and chills as the original Scandinavian story.

Folks have compared it to Fargo for its humour, and I'd agree with that, if you have to compare it to a North American film. I would compare it to some Nordic crime/thriller novels for its flavour (Harry Hole, maybe?) :) Sure, dark, sad, but really, really funny, absurdist. Liam Neeson gets to show an off-kilter facet of the vengeful man-of-action character he has often played. What I love a lot about this film is that it takes stock characters and turns them on their heads, resulting in a very funny film. Everybody in it was great. Special nod to Tom Jackson, Nathaniel Arcand, and a great bunch of Canadian supporting character actors. Other thought - I think maybe as a Canadian with a decent exposure to Native Canadian culture, I especially enjoyed the comedic spin on the 'native stereotype' if you will - I got to laugh *with* those characters, and also got to laugh *at* white culture ;> Like I said, droll and sly humour, everybody gets to shine.

Similar to the Norwegian original, In Order of Disappearance, and by the same director, it is in fact improved in some details, while some details make a bit less sense as they are transferred from the context of the original. In the original, Native Americans are Serbs, equally prideful people, so while the choice of Native Americans was as good as you get, some jokes do not make that much sense in the new context. Other jokes not present in the original were added, most notably Fargo overtones that are added and make sense in the American context alone, and the remake is in fact more polished, but very very close to the original. In any case, despite of the better rating, you do not gain much from watching the original. The point of the movie is in its dark humor, but the Cold Pursuit version also has Liam Neeson, who is the most logical casting choice, but this is a bit different kind of movie, much more sophisticated and artistic than his average revenge flick, there is over the top violent action flick but with additional quirks and layers.

168,domtaylor,Not cold enough.,5,22 March 2019,"There's some mild entertainment to be had from 'Cold Pursuit' and it's never boring per se, but overall it's very problematic. Its biggest issue is its tone. It purports to be a 'dark comedy', but it never quite gets the balance right. It can be really quite uncomfortable one minute, then over-the-top and silly the next. The humour feels misplaced as it's all very unsubtle and in-your-face, which actually stops the film dead in its tracks in service of delivering a joke. It's not just that the jokes don't land either; their inclusion dampens the effect of the whole story as you can't take any of it seriously- even when it wants you to. It also suffers from having too many uninteresting characters, including Neeson's protagonist himself, who are given no real room for development. This is a major problem with the film as you don't care about anyone and, therefore, anything that's happening. It also doesn't help that there are bizarrely long portions in which Neeson is completely absent. Sure, he may not be a very engaging protagonist, but every film needs one to keep the audience invested and the narrative moving, so when he disappears for large segments it becomes even harder to care about the story. It seems to focus more on the villain actually, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if he wasn't so annoying and utterly uncompelling. When things wrap up, it almost feels as if nothing has happened at all; almost like a waste of time. Thankfully though, it doesn't drag on and it can be entertaining in places, which stops it from being completely terrible. 5/10",Cold Pursuit

Liam Neeson is a snowplow driver who seeks revenge against some gangster drug dealers who murdered his son. Now I know what you're thinking that this sounds like the plot to every Liam Neeson, but trust me there's more to this movie than meets the eye. Within the first ten minutes of the movie we find out that his son is murdered and then later my thought was that the movie will be boring and predictable, but instead it was surprisingly hilarious. All the other Liam Neeson action movies have the same Taken plot line, but with different directors almost as if they want to direct their own version of Taken. However Hans Petter Moland makes his own idea for a Taken movie and what we have here is Taken meets Guy Ritchie meets Quentin Tarantino. This movie is also a remake of a foreign film with the same director, but instead of giving us a typical vengeance movie we get something completely different. I feel like Hans Petter Moland knew that audiences were getting bored with your average Liam Neeson vengeance flick and instead gave us a parody to every Liam Neeson action movie. The middle half of the movie could've been improved, but it was still funny and enjoyable. Cold Pursuit is still predictable and its not like this movie was an original concept thought up by the director and the screenwriters. The script could also be improved as it had plot holes that needed to be answered, but not as much that I was confused as the movie progressed. They just made some adjustments to it and gave us something that would make Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie proud.

The script is somewhat simple (typical for thrillers or action) and requires no mental effort to understand it. It has some comedy pinch too and lack of logic in some final scenes. Neeson has made better films. In my opinion, this is one of Neeson's weakest movies, but it serves as a pastime.

We follow the story form three perspectives: from a perspective of Nels Coxman, father whose kid had been killed, criminals' who had killed the kid and Native American gang who become involved in Coxmans' and killers dispute.Coxman in depicted as very vengeful, brutal and determined father. Criminal group is depicted as pretty stupid with their leader, Speedo, being overly malign and irreverent. Speedo plays very important role and his attitude is so overly spiteful that is sometimes just looks goofy in contrary to him trying to hold dangerous physical appearance. Native American group makes room for humor by engaging into battle with the former group. The chief purpose of having dark humor intertwined with violence is to make fun of gang life and show that there is nothing glamorous whatsoever in living such a life. For example, every time someone gets killed we see an obituary reminding us that we won't be seeing that character anymore. Story takes places during a heavy winter near Denver so you have a characteristic milieu for story to unfold and enough material for peculiar ""war tactics"".All in all, Cold Pursuit is a decent and unusual vengeance movie with dark humor which comes as a nice surprise in contrast to violence. See it if you like Neeson type of movies.",Cold Pursuit

Tarantino wannabe glorification of gun gore, plotless, pointless, stupid storyline, unrealistic characters, mediocre acting, etc. What was the point of the angry Thai bride for example.... utterly nuts!
Only thing saving this from going down the sewer was the stunning backdrop scenery.
Could have been done much better if it had followed Taken recipe... but even that's become cliched.

I went into it blind, so I had anticipated another routine action-thriller, and at first was confused by its tongue-in-cheek humor. As the story progressed I was more and more fascinated with its Fargo-type wit and can imagine the reaction in theaters must have been riotous. This could easily be a Coen brothers film, and that's a great compliment to its fantastic writing. Way surpassed what I was expecting! 7.5/10",Cold Pursuit

Don't waste your time with this exact copy and go for the original instead as the original is actually realistic and believable. This remake is so far out of place in the US its laughable. Anyone who knows Denver and the surrounding ski areas is going to be throwing their shoes at the screen in disgust. The fictional town they had to invent somewhere off the I-70 corridor 3 hours from denver makes very little geographic sense and distracts more from the movie than I orinally thought it would, not to mention the pacing felt very rushed and underdeveloped compared to original even though it seemed like this movie was almost an exact line by line ripoff....remake. Are US movie goers so lazy and ignorant that they cant read subtitles thus film makers feel the need to coddle US and remake the best foreign language films into the english tongue. Foreign films dont work in the US because they're foreign films and were written with that culture in mind....not US culture....that's like trying to turn apples into oranges. So even though its all about the money and producers see big paydays remaking foreign films into US.....film makers should sit on their hands until they can come up with their own ideas. If the foreign film is such a good watch then just advertise that one in the US markets and import it instead of ruining masterpieces.....but its all about $$$ greedy bass turds lol.",Cold Pursuit
197,Vivkon,A True Warrior,10,14 February 2019,"This movie is so interesting, because, being a remake of the original Norwegian film, it spreads the same idea, contained in the original movie. It is pretty curios that Scandinavian movie reflects the elements of Oriental philosophy. In particular, the movie repeats the words of Lao Lao Tzu: ""A true warrior never looks belligerent."" The father in this movie is a warrior, and he looks so cold and brave in seeking justice. All actions of the lead character can have a wide range of interpretations - revenge, self-therapy, justification, community service and etc. All actions are directed toward saving the lives of others.

Poor writing, on the nose dialogue, bad direction, and crazy moments when you don't know if the director expected you to laugh or cry. Just look at the poster photo - doesn't that remind you of Fargo? Right from the beginning the music leads you to think this is a comedy but it's not. It's not even dark comedy. The protagonist kidnaps a kid who drives away grinning in a snow plow? Really? This kid's feet can reach the gas pedal? He's all of mine or ten and can drive a honking snowplow? This isn't even the worst of it. I just look at hundreds of excellent scripts that sit on a shelf while crap like this attracts A-list actors like Neesom? Well, maybe he's just not of that caliber anymore. It's not like 'Commuter' was any better. And since when is it funny to watch a dog having a bowel movement in a film? This might be a great movie if you're 16...or 12. Wasted money seeing this. Honestly, the first 1/2 hour was acceptable. When you get past that it's all downhill. Killers romping in the snow laughing? Are we supposed to find that amusing? The lead 'bad guy' was SO over-acting it was pathetic. I won't see another Liam Neesom movie unless it's free and I have already seen every movie that's ever been made OR I am forced at gunpoint...nah, I'll take the bullet.

Plus the fact it was a remake of the original Norwegian film only seemed to confirm my hypothesis.
Which is why I was surprised that this turned out to be a black comedy crime fest, à la Fargo, while also being a rather subtle parody of Liam Neeson movies in general.You have the quiet everyday-man who goes on a somewhat comic mission of vengeance.
An over-the-top cliche crime lord.
Goons with silly names like Speedo, Limbo, Santa, Viking, Wingman, etc.
Accidental turf wars with Native Indians and Yankees in a ski resort of a sleepy town.

On the surface, Cold Pursuit looks to disappear along with his other enjoyable, but forgettable action hits, but this film is more Coen Brothers than generic action flick.The film starts out predictable enough, this time he is a family man who's son is killed by local gangsters, and good guy Neeson must ensure the Homicide Detectives of Colorado stay employed. This is however, where the film quickly starts to become more of an odd ball action/comedy than a classic revenge film. In fact, Neeson quickly takes a back seat to the collection of police officers, gang members and other off kilter acquaintances.This is the heart of the film, the almost Coen/Fargo style of comedy. violence, and if you enjoy this type of character, odd ball interactions, then this film will be perfect for you.The sheer number of characters eventually does dilute the film, with not enough screen time for everyone. Neeson is the strait man to the insanity around him. In fact, as the film concludes, Neeson has ceased to be a factor at all, and in some ways is mismatched to this film. Other characters are dropped, and most are not given their due.But this film is more about a fun, creative and often touching journey than the destination.8/10",Cold Pursuit

It's darkly comedic at times and had an ending I didn't expect. Laura Dern is a good actress and I wish she were cast in more movies and her chemistry with Liam was good, imo.

(his name DIckman vs Coxman was changed too)While this is a ok movie, I just really liked the original version better, the original had much more comedy, seriousness , better acting, neater snowplows, also the town felt much more small, isolated and cold constantly snowing, they showed much more plowing scenes (his job), as well as maintenance of the snow plows...etc it just made it much more believable where Liam is more like a part time worker in the remake.
overall I think this remake was pointless since the original was just awesome and subtitles worked out just fine too.with that said I recommend seeing the original if you can, if you can't find it then this movie is still decent, or do what I did and see them both (starting with the original) :)5/10",Cold Pursuit

Then slowly I realized it is a parody on the franchise, that's when I started to appreciate it. There are critiques on everything, as a result the second half becomes extremely enjoyable. Many scenes got me roflmao, including some deaths that are not shown on screen! In the end I felt sorry for the Indians who got caught up in all these...

For example nowhere in the movie main actors background can be found to show if he is capable of doing what he does or not. And that argument can be well true for the opposite side. It is very brief in explaining that aspects. I think that's why somehow you may be confused if things are serious or not.

It's just Neeson getting right to it going up the chain of drug gang connected bad guys and eliminating them one at a time the quickest way possible.There's just so many laughable mishaps you wouldn't expect attempting to reach the yuppy drug lord kingpin who comes across so stupidly arrogant but disturbingly ruthless.This is not your typical violent revenge killing movie and that's in a good way.",Cold Pursuit

Unfortunately, it just doesn't work here since these side events don't feel parallel to the main story or interesting. For example, a female cop, portrayed as eager and hard-nosed, is constantly discovering bits of info related Neeson's son death, even confronting him out of the blue about it, appearing suspicious of him for some reason, but nothing ever happens after that. What was the point? Then the 2nd half really gets dragged on by too much forced attention on the Native Americans and the same old ""white men took everything"" story (I don't want to sound insensitive but it was too out of place), and a kid that would've been better off staying on the sidelines.I had relatively high hopes for this movie, and was left disappointed.",Cold Pursuit

262,jimbo700,Best Liam Neeson Film I've Seen In A Long Time! (possible spoiler),8,17 June 2019,"I don't understand the people calling for a boycott over comments Liam Neeson made 40 years ago. If this controversy kept anyone out of the theatres, it's the viewers loss. ""Cold Pursuit"" was a teriffic film, which was visually stunning, with a bit of a surreal view of the snowy days and nights in Denver and the fictional ski resort of Kehoe, Colorado. Nels Coxman's (Liam Neeson) son dies of a heroin overdose. It turns out that the son was actually murdered by a drug kingpin named Trevor ""Viking"" Calcote (Tom Bateman). As Nels sets out to avenge his son's death, he's not the only one avenging a son's death. The body count begins and doesn't end until the credits roll. For the amount of death and personal loss, the film ends with a decent level of satisfaction, but I sure wish it would have continued for another 15 minutes or so to resolve a few things director Hans Petter Moland left to the imagination. Cold Pursuit is described as a ""dark comedy"", but I didn't laugh much (not a negative). By the way, Hans Petter Moland also directed the Norwegian film, ""In Order of Disappearance"" upon which this film is based, and ""Cold Pursuit"" is nearly a virtual remake of ""In Order of Disappearance"". It is available in North America with dubbed English.",Cold Pursuit

265,mcoats-71101,Probably the worst film I've seen,1,27 November 2019,"I realised after watching this that it's based on a Scandinavian film that's probably much, much better. The premise is decent (although Liam Neeson is beyond getting typecast - it's almost like he's contractually obliged to avenge a death in every film he'll make forever more!) but it fails on so many levels. It even feels cheap, like a TV movie.What makes this so bad is the attempt at humour. It just doesn't translate. The screen baddy is playing a 1960s Batman-esque villain but without a stupid costume, and his array of henchmen and supporting actors are equally useless. Death is dished out liberally but without any real reason. Scenes also make little sense - why would Neeson's character be handily taken down in a lift to the car park alone by this random drug dealer? How does he find everyone so easily?The introduction of the Indian gang is senseless as is the violent shoot 'em up - there are also endless explanations of who's who in the script because the writer probably knew we'd stopped watching half way through.Just terrible",Cold Pursuit
266,chasemykleby,Seriously loopy in a good way,6,9 March 2019,"Seriously loopy in a good way, ""Cold Pursuit"" is a Liam Neeson thriller with a warped sense of humor that overrides its blood lust. It takes the structure of a typical Neeson revenge vehicle - Neeson is wronged and seeks to settle the score - and turns it into a meta commentary on gangster films and action thrillers as a whole.
Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland has fashioned the film after his own ""In Order of Disappearance,"" a 2014 thriller that took place in his homeland. In hiring Moland to direct his own remake, Hollywood did him a solid, and the film preserves the director's quirky sense of humor while updating the story's setting to Colorado. Cold Pursuit does not dedicate much time to establishing the Coxman family before thrusting viewers into the crux of the narrative. On one hand, that approach is appreciated since Moland wastes no time in delivering on the promise of the trailers.
As for the rest of the script, the results are a bit of a mixed bag. On the positive side of the spectrum, Moland and writer Frank Baldwin do succeed in giving the film a bit of personality with its morbid comedy and amusing dialogue passages. Cold Pursuit's attempt to wear its Coens and Quentin Tarantino influences on its sleeve, meaning these elements don't always land with the intended effect, but Moland does hit the mark more often than not. However, he does struggle a bit in regards to pacing.
Ultimately, Cold Pursuit is but a fleeting entry in Neeson's filmography that falls somewhere in the middle when compared to his previous efforts. The film isn't bad by any means, but some may find it a bit lacking due to issues with the script and editing.",Cold Pursuit

But it does feel like ever since Taken, there has been an attempt to cash in on the idea of Liam Neeson as an action star... which is fine, except the movies since have been subpar in comparison to Taken in terms of emotional investment in the characters and the quality writing/directing.

Hans Peter Moland is a Norwegian director who made this same film in 2014 but with the Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård. In 2019 and with Liam Neeson, he returns to make exactly the same film, with many similar scenes but with slight adaptations that contextualize it in the United States of America. It is not new in the History of Cinema, but it is rare, because adaptations of European films for the American market are generally performed by directors accustomed to that market and are very simplified in the narrative in order to please a wider and less demanding audience. To shorten my analysis of the film, it is good and even shows interesting and original ideas that the trailer does not anticipate. When we see the trailer, it looks like it's just another action movie with Liam Neeson (an excellent professional, versatile and talented in many ways), but it ends up offering us a black comedy that resembles much of the work of Brother Cohen.

Lastly and most importantly, you can subvert a genre, but when you subvert the rules of basic storytelling by throwing the plot out of the window, you end up with a flopping turd that could NEVER get these puzzling positive reviews if Liam Neeson was not involved with the project.Give it a watch if you have time to kill, but lower your expectation to subzero.",Cold Pursuit

273,dogmaticdogs,"Great Film Once You Understand Its Intention, With a Beautifully Surreal Depiction of Denver",8,9 February 2019,"This film was not what I was expecting but once I understood and came to grips with the fact it was a dark comedy, in a Fargo-esque sort of way, and a parody of revenge killing films, rather than meant to be taken seriously other than for its beautiful absurdity, I started to really enjoy it.The whole movie was fun escapism with gratuitous violence, and hyper-exaggerated cliché portrayals of Native Americans, crime bosses and average men being local heroes, etc. Not to mention an exponentially growing kill tally. What is not to love?It was a special treat for those of us that live in Denver, as although much of the movie was supposed to take place here, none of the neighborhoods, architecture, streets, buildings, trees, landscaping, mountain ranges, etc. matched anything close to what really exists in Denver. I spent the entire movie looking for something I could place as actually being in Denver, but I came up empty. Instead, a totally fictitious version thereof was portrayed (too surreal to match any actual city I am aware of, but closer to a blend of the more affluent parts of Los Angeles and Vancouver than Denver, with world class architecture and night clubs) which fit in perfectly with the artfully crafted alternative universe intended to be created. Like the bizarre relationships between the characters, I slowly began to realize that what first appeared to be a sloppy annoyance was in fact an intentional critique of the genre and actually a quite clever game with the audience.Many will undoubtedly knock this film for being unrealistic, absurd, over the top, culturally insensitive, and with settings that did not match named cities (at least those such as Denver that actually exist). Those people just failed to see that was the entire point. You shouldn't go in expecting to see realism, complex character development, suspense and drama, or something akin to Taken. Instead, go in expecting to see a dark comedy parody film. Think Fargo meets Peppermint, with a wink to Quentin Tarantino in honor of his impact on modern cinema.",Cold Pursuit

Had no idea this movie had been released, and went to the theatre today to catch ""Glass"" before it left. However, I was a bit too late for that one and noticed the new Neeson movie.Theatre was surprisingly quite full and the crowd obviously had a good time.
""Cold Pursuit"" is a semi-serious thriller that is in a way a sort of spoof of past Neeson flicks and the genre. A lot of dark humor here, and the movie almost goes off the rails with it by the end. One movie that comes to mind is ""In Bruge"", where the violence is very much a part of the humor. Smart, funny, and dark..with a touch of class to boot. A slight nod to past Coen Brothers' films I think as well - at least in feel and atmosphere.Many deaths here, not always on camera, and the movie even does you a favor of tallying it up for you in a funny way. (note the religious symbols with each death card)Liam is billed as the star, of course, and events surrounding him obviously serve as a catalyst to what unfolds along the way. However, this movie is not all about him being front and center as his typical past thrillers have been. Really great cast here and the scenery is cast member in its own right.The two flaws in the movie, in my opinion, was not fully realizing the story of the two cops played by Emmy Rossum and John Dorman, especially Rossum. Also, the movie ultimately seems to lose track a bit on the event that set everything in motion - Coxman's (Neeson) murdered son.Still, the movie's end was pretty satisfying nonetheless.

The premise is that the only son of the protagonist was murdered by heroin injection from a dealer mob, but local police (This is Norway, population of 4 million, where violent crime is rare) decided it was an ""accidental overdose"". The rest of the plot reads like the ""Taken"" franchise where the son/daughter of a ""mature"" bad-ass efficiently tracks down the ""baddies"" due his ""very specific skill set"".However, the freshness of the original with only two internationally-known actors has been lost in this bland remake, with the script only serving as a vehicle in which to plop the ""Taken"" franchise led by Liam Neeson.The original screenplay was so out-of-the-box for Norway, that the action sequences appeared as fantastical as the long woman killing hundreds of goons. The absurdity of the original does not translate into an American setting - where it is NOT absurd that a quiet civil servant could have an assassin's instinct and skills into his 60s, that a drug mob can escape police attention, and that non-military civilians can openly carry arms. The Scandinavian movie had the appeal of a Quentin Tarantino production with deaths so facile, clean, efficient and unemotional - that it could only be seen as a cartoonish black humor. The absurdity of the original does not translate into an American setting - where it is NOT absurd that a quiet civil servant could have an assassin's instinct and skills into his 60s, that a drug mob can escape police attention, and that non-military civilians can openly carry arms.There was one glaring plot hole even in the original, and reproduced in the US version: How on earth would any Medical Examiner worth his/her salt conclude that a cadaver with no physical evidence of prior injected narcotic use would have been an addict? Surely, even the greenest forensic pathologist would look at the arms of the deceased before even arriving at such a conjecture. In tiny, uneventful Norway, I can just believe that the inexperience of local pathologists may have led to this oversight/negiigence, but as everyone has been flooded with forensics-based US shows for well over a decade, it still beggars belief.Also gone is the emotional richness of the characters. There had been a gay sub-story between two of the ""gangsters"", which ultimately led to reprisal from the bereft, secret partner. In the US version, there really isn't a logical motivation for one of the gang to betray the gang; all we are led to deduce is that, despite his White appearance, his affiliation with ""Indians"" killed by his boss, occurred.The emotional depth of the Liam Neeson and Charlotte Rampling characters was un-nuanced, and not the slightest empathetic. They were cast for ""marketability"".------------------------
The difference with the US remake is essentially budget, resources (3 times as many crew!), locale (Canada, not Scandinavia = but set in the US), loss of the freshness, and a strong sense of a ""franchise"" milking.It would have been better to have the original actors provide soundtracks in English (assuming most Scandinavians can do so), and, maybe, a Quentin Tarantino at the helm.",Cold Pursuit

284,lythis-love,What movie does it want to be?,4,3 March 2019,"I was expecting an average Liam Neeson action Movie with, well, a lot of snow. I just learned a minute before the movie started, that it is a remake.The movie contains lots of deaths. Some made in a brutal way, but also sometimes comical, as in the last scene just before the movie ended.
What bothers me, was, that there is a huge gap between comical deaths and brutal thrilling killing. This film switched between those two lines and often didn't know rather I should laugh or be disgusted, shocked even sad. Every killing being underlined with a harmonic, floppy and bemusing music. A lot of scenes have been stretched to give it funny underline but they kept on stretching the scenes so it made me really uncomfortable.The other thing was the pace of the movie, everything happened so fast and at the same time there was no end to be seen.
Cold Pursuit started with a father who got honored as citizen of the year, the house with son and wife was shown. Everything looked in harmony. The Son died so quickly and I actually didn't really get it first, why and how.
When the Parents saw their son in the morgue (after that horrible scene where the Coroner or what pumped up the bar .. TOO LONG!) there was like.. barely no emotion. I mean, they've just lost their son? As the movie proceeded really no grief, sorrow or moaning TOGETHER over their son.
I annoyed me how the main Character first trying to kill himself (leaving behind a wife in grief over son and husband?!) and started a revenge on a drug cartel. Never like being at home comforting his wife.. just doing his revenge. No wonder he left him. Sad for the actress though, having like one 4 minutes of screen time.I found it very unrealistic how an average snow plower could handle a whole drug cartel on his own only be knowing their street names. Even started a fight between two big drug lords.There was this one strong female character, mother of the to-be-kidnaped-boy. I really, really liked her acting. Standing against Viking, giving him contra. I hated viking so much. Well, the actor must have been really good then.At the End they all killed each other and Liam Neeson was left behind. Also! The Boy was just left behind. I would have liked it, if the Boy was like a new son to Liam Neeson, so he would have a new chance to make himself a better father. Or the Boy having someone who actually noticed him and would spend with him.
No, it ended with the Boy driving the snow plow on his own around and the police officer just looked as dumb as she was: Oh, there is boy driving a snow plow on his own at night.
AND SHE LETS HIM GO AWAY WITH IT?
What was it with the police plot anyway, they did nothing to the story. They only filled a gap to have a bit more jokes really.I like the scenery. All the snow, not so much CGI - just humans acting. With all the superhero movies jumping on you at every corner, I nearly forgot what a nice landscape and pure acting was.",Cold Pursuit

Fargo was amazing, but Cold Pursuit was... well... strange.",Cold Pursuit
288,haroldareynoldsIV,"Hilarious Spoof, Don't Listen to Critics; It's Fun, Funny, and Suspenseful",8,16 February 2019,"When this movie first came out it had an 86/100 on Rotten Tomatoes and about a 67 on Metacritic, both very good critics' consensus scores, but after Neeson's remarks about how he felt about forty years ago after his niece was raped, the media and SJQ crowd and critics came pouring in and really downvoted the total scores. It's still in the ""good"" range, but critics are clearly judging it while being offended by Neeson's comments, rather than the movie itself.
Now, to the movie. First off, this is not what you would expect. Most people will go into viewing this looking for the usual, overdone, redundant, repetitive, Neeson revenge flick that has been coming out about every January for the past ten years. For avid fans of those films (recent entries include A Walk Among the Tombstones, The Commuter, Taken 3, etc), you will probably be a little disappointed. However, for people who are expecting that and yet not looking forward to the same old conventional (and therefore boring, predictable) black and white plot, you will probably be pleasantly surprised.
Personally, I have not been a fan of any Neeson action-genre movies of the past five years. They're decent, but nothing special. The last Neeson action movie I truly enjoyed was the Grey (which also had a surprised tone to it- that one being philosophical), and I am still a fan of the original Taken movie. So when I went into viewing Cold Pursuit, after reading a few reviews and seeing the previews, I had it pegged as a conventional revenge-action film in the snow. I saw a couple of mentions of ""humor and comedy"", but I really didn't and couldn't believe it would be anything substantial or noteworthy; I thought maybe like a Schwarzenegger movie with a couple of one liners, and that would be it.
So here is my review of Cold Pursuit. If you enjoy comedies, dark comedies, and style, then you are probably going to like this movie. If you are inclined to be a fan of Tarantino or the Coen Brothers's Fargo, then you will probably enjoy this movie. The reason why is because this movie is a spoof and a subversion of the expected Neeson-action movie.
There was one moment early on that really marked its devolution into comedy, and at first it didn't seem like much, but it signified and foreshadowed where the rest of the movie was going. This was when the radio asks ""who is the best Denver Quarterback of all-time, Elway or Manning?"", and the screen goes black and you hear Neeson saw ""Elway""....Interesting, right? Well, the next victim he finds, before he decided to shoot him with his sawed off shotgun, he asks him, ""Elway or Manning, who's the best QB?"" The bad guy responds, Neeson, agrees, and then shoots him anyway. Most of the material for the first half hour prior to this moment made it seem like it was a standard revenge movie, but this was the first really confusing and subtle hint at comedy. Still, what comes beyond that is even far more comical.
We are introduced to a gang of Indians lead by their mafia leader, White Bull, who operate a drug ring in the Denver region, a white mafia henchman to their ringleader named Viking, who has an unusual way of seducing hotel maids, other henchmen with hidden sexual identities, an Afro-American assassin who hates the music that is playing as he is being smuggled into the city to do his service only for the driver to change the channel into ""Barbie Girl in a Barbie World"", a hardened Asian wife who commands her gang member husband and is in her own eccentric world, amusing mono y mono faceoffs and dialogue between gang members, edited in recognition of casualty names and religious symbols as if to give them a sendoff and acknowledgement, and a completely bizarre ending and final five minutes that in hindsight is absolutely hilarious (when it first happens you'll be confused and not sure of what you think but it will draw a laugh). Lots of this won't make sense to anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but those who have will know what this refers to.
Bottom line: if you just want some fun entertainment for a couple of hours full of action, suspense and surprisingly comical and genuinely funny material, then Cold Pursuit is for you. Go in expecting ""Taken on Slopes"". leave satisfied at the Tarantino-esque dialogue and editing, and Dumb and Dumber-type comedy.",Cold Pursuit

It wants to be violent, but tones down he violence to the extent that one cannot suspend disbelief and follow the narrative.

I didn't dislike this movie, it was fun to watch. The jokes came of a little bit forced imo, they messed the timing up. It did make the movie watchable though, it made me relax and sit comfortably back in my seat. So that's a good thing.This movie wasn't really about Liam Neeson, but more about a couple of gangsters who were in a feud and Liam showed up a couple of times to kill some people. So his character presence wasn't that strong and dominant as we've seen in other Neeson's movies.The bad guy was a bit too comical and also not a very good actor. This guy has the looks but his voice and acting were below average. He reminded me of the Superman / Lois and Clark adventures from the 90s, he would make an excellent villain, so I would like to suggest he'll travel back in time 30 years and try again there. His movie wife - Julia Jones - is smoking hot btw, she had a minor role, but it made this movie more watchable.I can't the remember the score, so I guess it didn't impress me much.I don't understand what Julia Dern did in this movie. There was no chemistry between her and Neeson. She barely had 3 lines to speak. And suddenly she was gone, she literally left the script. Wtf!? That's some lazy a#s writing there, lmfao. Oh well, she probably took off to save some dinos. Right? Right!Anyway, drink a beer or don't drink a beer. Who cares? Neeson will always be Neeson, the guy has a humongous nose btw, but his voice is bigger and that's what makes Neeson Liam, Liam Neeson.This movie is like any other sh#t-a#s garbage movie from Hollyweird, it's ok-ish, but you'll won't miss out is if you would skip this one.Stay blessed and in the now!

Really,...you have? Wow...;well good news, Hollywood heard you! Liam goes around a snow covered landscape, avenging the death of his son (not really a spoiler it happens at the beginning and is the whole point of the film) by taking out each member of the drug gang. This film had a lot going for it, but there were some missed opportunities, mostly at the end of the film. We never find out what happened to the drug lord's son (a new father figure was an interesting storyline they play with in the plot) and the film doesn't have a real ending, rather, it just stops. At the end, 2 characters (not saying which) drive off with one of them holding a gun on the other one. What?? That is the end? I don't think they go off to start a new life together nor do they become best friends. But I've sat through 2 hours of this film, at least wrap it up.

I was expecting Liam's The Grey performance, the settings of this movie is almost same, winter, ice and mountains.
Except I was disappointed for two things, first Liam looked bored and didn't put his efforts properly. Second, they shouldn't copy the original movie frame by frame. The remake should take the theme and advance itself and give something new to it. This isn't remake in true sense.
Also, the humor didn't really done properly.
Those who gave this movie more than 6 stars either not seen the original movie or die hard fan of Liam Neeson. I gave 6 stars because of Liam Neeson and premise of this movie.

So naturally, in the year 2019 it's almost prohibited by law to make such characters negative.Oh, even worse, one of the bad guys is named Jacob Ruthman. Those people are even more protected, they are almost never bad guys in any movie. I think there's even a special Hollywood commission that secretly censors all scripts for such character names, kinda similar to censorship in North Korea.But this movie broke the rules. They made people who are prohibited to be bad guys exactly that - bad guys. Hence, it got degraded from 8.0 to 6.4 for not being politically correct. Isn't that a great thing?

The story was shallow and uninspiring. I was forcing myself not to fall asleep. It was more difficult than Liam Neeson's struggles. I wanted to be entertained, I was not expecting a masterpiece and all politics aside I gave this movie a fair chance to impress me. I can easily say that it was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Nothing worked for me here, nothing !!! , well maybe few shots of Denver and snowy landscape was inspiring but even this was over used. It was like director managed to frame some breathtaking scenery and was so much in awe of his movie's maker genius that he wanted to re-use it over and over again. It was like shouting to the world. Hey, look at me. I know how to make movies but the truth to be told you dont, you just dont.The character development is non existent. We got only 1 minute scene of Liam and his frosty family and this was absolutely not enough to get invested in the movie. I was more fascinated by the deputy's mini sub plot than the main event. All supporting actors had more interesting stories to tell than a main character. Even the Thailand chick was more captivating that our hollywood veteran.Why we are shown these collection of scenes not bringing anything into the movie. Why I am suppose to believe that ordinary Joe turns into killing machine? He clearly has a past but movie never tells you what this past was. The villain was awful, over the top. The Indian gangster family was the same. The final moment of the movie nicely summarizes what you just watched. It was abysmal, awful. Please do not make a movie like this ever again.

321,art-miller,Fargo wannabe that fails miserably. Save your cash,2,7 March 2019,"Where to begin...?Firstly you have to question Liam Nesson's quality control when he agrees to make a film like this. Surely he doesn't need the money. He could back away from scripts like this now -- the Taken tough guy stuff has been done to death. He is better than that. To be honest, I thought he looked less than enthusiastic throughout this film.OK. Whoever wrote this script and made this film is a big fan of Fargo -- the film and the TV series. There are too many similarities to list them all, but the snow, Denver, the multiple casual killings, the black humour etc etc.But it is so blatant that it simply doesn't work. Yes, the humour is dark and the shootings are so frequent that you don't even blink. But it is not subtle and does not have a sense of craft about the writing. Meanwhile old Liam is sort of bumbling about in the background having little effect on proceedings.Just to add to the mix they even shoehorn the usual obnoxious/ cute American kid into the film. Laura Dern is completely wasted. Could have phoned in her ten pages.The villains are all comic book. The main drug dealer -- who we never see dealing or handling drugs in any way, -- Mr Viking, gives an hysterical pantomime performance that is so bad it tempts you to exit by the nearest door. He might have been good in his school plays, but there is no place for him in the movie business. Go get a real job.I saw on another review that this is a remake. If that is the case then they should have let it moulder in its grave.I return to my main point: Liam Nesson needs to very carefully consider his options for the future. Continuing down this vigilante role route is leading nowhere. Get yourself a new agent, pal. Start considering your reputation. Do you actually remember Schindler's List....?Oh, and Fargo is brilliant and untouchable. Cold Pursuit is dull, predictable, annoying and disposable. Nuff said.....

326,Jozinek,"Revenge is a dish best served cold, and Liam delivers on that perfectly.",7,10 November 2019,"So I just saw this film and was pleasantly surprised from what I thought would ge a pretty forgettable and generic action movie. It's set in a ski town in the Rockies and it follows a snow plougher whose son was kidnapped and murdered by drug dealers. Using tactics of brutal intimidation he hunts down those responsible for his son's death. It's satisfying, and I just adore the acting, especially for the antagonist: an arrogant, supressive man with a snarky attitude as well as an obsession over his son's health and custody. You see fights between him and his wife over their son's custody, and I truly felt the resentment that they had for each other.As well as Coxman's (Liam Neeson) revenge, you have a subplot with two rival drug gangs, and there's a build-up to a showdown that they're to have later on in the film. I found it engaging and I also like how the two kingpins were almost like polar opposites in terms if character (one is talkative and sarcastic whilst the other is calm and silent, it's a great contrast which I liked, they also have significant cultural differences). Another subplot follows the two cops who have two different approaches to tackling narcotic crime in their area.Overall it was a solid movie with quite a unique style to it: a film about crime in a frozen wasteland that honours every character after their death. But there were some cringeworthy moments that I thought were straight up unnecessary (e.g. one of the kingpins getting grabbed by the balls by his wife, as well as a veteran cop vomiting at the sight of a dead body while a much younger and quite frankly, less experienced cop remaining completely calm. There was also a gay kissing scene but it actually ended up being a decent plot device, so I forgive it).",Cold Pursuit

Liam Neeson's charater is the avergae guy with average inteligence and minimum weapons skills. His kid does get muredered and he does want revenge, but what makes this movie different (and quite good) is that it's almost a comedy. The darkest humour you can find.

There's the revenge element that carries the plot, but the plot can be hard to follow. Not enough is explained how the protagonist discovers his next target and there's not really much followup after the climax, to explain what happens to the remaining characters. The story relies on the emotions of grief and anger, but presents it in an atmosphere that mocks any real feelings, which is a distracting contradiction.

We're so used to seeing Liam Neeson as a humorless revenge-driven machine, that we forget his acting range, and skill at deadpan sly comedy. Half-way through this, I remembered his fine early film, the sly comedy ""Gun Shy"", where he played a burned-out CIA assassin who seeks psychotherapy while all the time getting involved in an undercover operation targeting a Mafia boss superbly played by Oliver Platt. This movie is equally hilarious, though with many more dead bodies, yet played completely deadpan, all against a backdrop of gorgeously bleak and majestic winter scenery in the Rockies.A fine supporting cast of thugs (all with ridiculous nicknames) and local police-especially Emily Rossum as a zealous town police officer-rounds out the acting talent, and the plot does not distract the viewer with tangential backstory or subplots, though there are one or two surprising little twists with secondary characters that play important roles in the inevitable denouement.Not everyone lives happily ever after at the end, although this viewer certainly did by the closing credits.

It's really oddly quirky and these parts don't mesh with the general tone of the movie, it's more like the director has multiple personality disorder and turns at the drop of a hat. These quirky parts try to be funny but aren't. I only laughed at one part which wasn't intended to be funny, but I found it personally satisfying, probably much to the distaste of the PC brigade.I see people talking of others who have boycotten Neeson's films due to something he said a long time ago..

Going into it I was expecting to see a ""Liam neeson"" film. It's what you sign up for when you buy a ticket. But this was not it. Which is fine. Different is great, BUT, I didn't understand what this film was until halfway through, but by then it was too late. The first sign something was off, was the opening score. It was too light for an action film, and it only got worse when it turned to an Italian type feel. I was so confused. I had no idea what kind of movie this was. Then he and his wife have almost no reaction to viewing their sons body in the morgue, after a very uncomfortable comedic set piece (raising the body up. Used again later, I think twice) and then for some reason the wife is pissed at her husband, but we don't know why at this point. later we kind of get the clue that it's because he didn't spend enough quality time with his son, but we don't see any of that. We're told it basically. I have to say, I love the humor though, especially the very last scene. Though what's happening in the scene is a bit confusing.

Just skip it!!!,4,23 February 2019,"Premise:Nelson Coxman, a citizen of the year, is living peacefully with a wife and son. His son is killed but closed as drug overdose. Coxman finds the culprits behind his death and starts killing one by one suspecting Viking, the drug lord, behind his son's death. Viking kills son of Whitebull, rival don, suspecting the death of his men. Finally, all three meet each other and what happens is the rest of the plot....What worked well?Comedy: The movie is actually a dark comedy - humour through characters (especially villain), dialogues etc. Thankfully, this helps to sail through the otherwise dull and blunt movie
What didn't work well?Too many subplots irrelevant to the movie and characters without any purpose. There's a nosy cop trying to find out the truth behind murders but do not have an ending. A well taken care son of villain - not sure why he is not close to father. Nelson's wife leaves him but he doesn't seem to care where she went, unnecessary characters in the villain group just to evoke humour but not related to the plot.
Too slow : Nelson starts to kill the villains in the first 15 mins. After that, it goes on it's own flow with various sub-plots and loses it's momentum. A damn bad screenplay!!!! It's almost 2 hours and I was eagerly waiting for the climax to end my torturous journey.
It might be a small town where cop may not interfere much but he kills the baddies in such a gory fashion that atleast they should have some suspicions for the mess he leaves!! No, cops don't even visit the place. Come on, audience are not idiots.
Liam Neeson tried to deviate from his usual ""Saviour of the day"" stereotyped character but signed up for much worse!!! It's not his cup of tea and ultimately tastes worse!

With wit.
It needs to be funny. Because the people being killed are just props. You don't care about them. It means nothing to you that they die.This screenplay couldn't make up its mind if it was Gerard Butler's Law Abiding Citizen, Fargo, or one of Arnold's 80s flicks.It was quite violent. Like slowly punching guys to death type of violence.The main bad guy, Viking, was a lazy caricature of every mommy's boy psychopath that you've previously endured.
A lousy father.
A bully who is okay with his wife grabbing his nuts in front of his crew after he tries to side swipe her and misses.

I'm seeing 10/10 ratings for a movie that has a ""professional assassin"" strolling into the home of his mark to tell him and then expects to walk right out. The only likable characters in this whole movie are Liam and the child actor that's apparently okay with being kidnapped. The child gets taken by a random stranger and he's absolutely cool with it.

While there are some standout cinematic shots in this version and a slightly faster pace, it is a complete shot-for-shot remake of the original with the exception of a few character names and a single scene. The cast are largely wasted -- you could have hired unknown actors and changed the location, and the resulting film would have still been a watchable, but mediocre affair. The same character motivations and interactions are present, but are somewhat muted from the original film. Liam Nesson pretty much does a low-key version of his character from ""Taken"" that is less credible than the Stellan Skarsgård character. No spoilers, but there's even one character in both films that I intensely disliked for the same reasons... and it wasn't even the main villain.

Ok bad guy dies cool but As for Liam Neeson movies this is the worst . The action scenes are dull, the plot ridiculous and Laura Dern is in film almost as a second thought. The cops are clueless yet don't serve a purpose to the plot . I could go on and on. I guess a movie this bad needs to ""succeed "" to keep the endless stream of wanna be writers heading to Hollywood to ""make it"". I get why Liam Neeson gave up the genre . If the movie sucked just imagine the screenplay . He'd have to read hundreds like a year . Be warned about this film . It's bad. But Liam Neeson holds up but just watch taken again.",Cold Pursuit
392,ItLookedBetterOnBetamax,Weak Outing From Neeson,4,3 March 2019,"Judging by Liam Neeson's previous films, it seems almost mandatory now that his character has to play a family man who has to deal with the death or kidnapping of his family. Maybe its a requirement of any new project he takes on.Having recently watched 'The Commuter' which I vaguely enjoyed and often had some compelling moments, I was expecting something similar in Cold Pursuit. What I got was something much weaker.In this story Liam neeson is an upstanding citizen of Kehoe, who works as a plough operator to clear roads to keep Kehoe alive. Neeson's character loses his son when local drug dealers working for the Viking murder him to cover up their drug smuggling operations through the Kehoe airport. Neeson discovers this and sets out to take revenge. Soon the Viking suspects a rival drug organisations run by White Bull is responsible and a turf war breaks out.Like most Neeson films, 'The Commuter' is an action thriller and I was expecting something similar here. However what I got was a half baked dark comedy action film, where neither the comedy nor the action was particularly good. Not only was the script quite weak but also the pacing of the film was pretty poor. Often during action scenes there would either be several cuts or the the film would entirely skip from the start of a scene to the end where Neeson dispatched the drug dealers without anything in the middle. Similarly the film would keep cutting between serious, action and comedic scenes leading to plenty of jokes and dialogue falling flat.The characters in this film are also pretty poor. The Viking turns out to be a knock off Joaquin Phoenix who somehow runs a drug gang despite being a whiney unlikeable brat who is okay with killing his own men at the drop of a hat. White Bull is also a dull character who just walks around staring at things and sighing.Liam Neeson's character is barely developed at all during the start of the film and turns into basically an assassin without much of a second thought. Neeson's character is not developed beyond the fact he had a son and wants revenge. It's almost like the director knew this was such a stereotypical role for Liam Neeson he skipped the initial development and dropped a few familiar plot points like a family in danger with a sly wink to the audience and made no attempt to differentiate this from previous roles Neeson has Taken (wink).Another issue with character development was that the film was split into chapters, each one focused on a different gang member being killed. This meant that often characters would appear and then be killed all in the space of 5 minutes then never mentioned again. That is not enough time to develop characters nor enough time for the audience to have any emotional attachment to characters when they are killed, whether that be because the character is good or bad. I didn't care when anyone was killed. I didn't care when Neeson's son was killed after being in the film for about 2 minutes nor did I care when any of the gang members were killed.The film plays out as you would expect with one big action shoot out between the two rival gangs with all the bad guys dying then Neeson riding off into the sunset without any criminal charges, despite killing multiple people and kidnapping a child.Would not recommend this film, not even when it comes to any streaming service. Even if its free to watch, its not worth the 2 hours of your life.",Cold Pursuit
393,MarkAylwyn,Hauntingly evocative,8,6 December 2020,"Wow... I expected the standard Hollywood action fare but was pleasantly surprised to find that despite the overt violence, of which there was a lot, Hans Petter Moland somehow managed to create a tone in Cold Pursuit that was both hauntingly evocative and beautiful. Doubtless one of the superlative moments in the film is where Laura Dern has nothing to say (you'll see what I mean).The tone and level of craftsmanship most likely has something to do with the fact that Moland also directed the original 2014 Norwegian version of the film. What a wonderful opportunity for a director to get to make the same film twice, and to my mind it pays off in spades. It definitely won't be for everyone, but if you're after something entertaining with a different spin, where the meaningless and pointless death of so many is meaningful and pointed, then you'll find this a refreshing change.",Cold Pursuit

They seemed so in-tune, yet.... Just didn't seem credible. Watch it, you will see it.Anyhoo. Good Movie.

''The Snowman'' and asian ''Old Boy'' are perfect examples of this.
The orignal '' Snømannen'' wasn't a 10 but it's way better than the remake with Michael Fassbender as Detective Harry Hole.

The film strangely tries to focus both on Liam Neeson and the bad guy, who is incredibly cartoonish and laughable by the way. But it never quite gets the balance right, and you feel nothing for any of them. The film also incorporates many pop culture references which is a good sign of a bad piece of art trying to distract from its poor quality with 'oh hey Kanye!' and 'smoke weed'. It feels like every scene is at odds with each other.

What soon became apparent was that this film does not take itself at all seriously as there are plenty of funny sequences and quotes - most unexpected but welcome!

As in any remake in this one, Cold Pursuit, some things are changed by introducing new characters and giving more screen time to other in order to adapt the script to the politically correct gender and racial guidelines of the local movie industry. It is presented in a way that one doesn't need brains to understand what's going on which eliminates the pleasure of thinking and deducting logical solutions and answers to arised questions while watching the movie.

The location is cold, damn cold, with snow drifts that are taller than a single storey house. I was quite amazed to see the snow plough clearing the snow and pictorially the location creates a wonderful backdrop to the film/It's always entertaining to see the most unexpected people take on the bully's, and this definitely doesn't disappoint, in fact his first kill almost comes as a shock because it seems so out of character, but his desire for revenge makes him take on some particularly nasty people and come out on top.
The other aspect of this film is that the characters are believable, just ordinary folk surrounded by a crime ring that they don't seem aware of and the police are aware but reluctant to do anything about. Another nice touch was the introduction of Native American Indians into the script , quite unexpected and frankly quite novel.

We also get to spend time with the bad guys, so much that we get to know some of the characters.There's way more plot and story to this movie than I would have ever thought.

Liam Neeson is his usual powerful self, and I really enjoyed his performance. What I really struggled with was the ""dark comedy"" element that was so forced it made me cringe.
I can see the scenes that are supposed to be funny being played out, but each time those moments missed their mark with me.
Cold Pursuit worked for me during the action scenes, they are well staged and dramatic, but the film greatly lets itself down when it tries to go for decent storytelling.
There is a lot of scenes of the various Gangs playing off against each other, but because all of the characters are scripted to be annoying and unlikable, I really felt nothing for them as they were killed.
In most Liam Neeson films I can't wait for him to take down the bad guys, with Cold Pursuit I lost interest in who was who pretty early on.

428,p1nn,Well developed characters,7,18 February 2019,"The movie explores the theme of loss not only from the perspective of Nels Coxman (Liam Neeson), but also from the perspectives of the villains. While it seems at first that Nels is the character seeking revenge, as the movie develops, we see that multiple parties are seeking revenge, all for the ones they love. The movie opens with the death of Nels' son, giving the audience the impression that the drug dealers are ruthless and heartless animals. However, as the movie dives into the lives of the different people on Viking's team, we see two gay drug dealers caring and loving each other while trying to hide their love from others and the pain of loss as one is killed right in front of the other. We see the other one seeking revenge for his dead lover by betraying Viking to White Bull at the end. We also see the loyalty of Wingman, till his last breath, did not betray his brother. From White Bull's perspective, we also see him seeking revenge for his dead son and his unspoken shared moment with Nels at the end as two old men who had to send off their only sons. Even Viking, who seemed cold-blooded, displayed his affection for his son by preventing his employees from talking about work in front of his son and trying to teach his son to stand up to the bullies in school.However, I think the plot could be simplified a little given the mass of characters and the multiple plots going on. For example, the whole subplot of the betraying hitman, was unnecessary and did not really serve a purpose in the story telling. Even Wingman himself and his wife were unnecessary additions to the movie. Since there was already a bond going on between the two gay lovers, the bond between the two drug dealers over the hotel housekeeping situation was uncalled for.Overall, I think the movie is great and all the main characters are well developed.",Cold Pursuit

Laura Dern must have figured out that she should leave the project after the first 20 min and you never see her again. Liam Neesen's character doesn't seem to even notice she's gone. She could have phoned in her part. The dumbest part is when a group of American Indians are standing on a ski slope just doing nothing, then one decides to take a paraglider for a ride while he was supposed to be a gangster.

No problem.However, the vague and ambiguous way the wife left Nils/Nels was baffling in the extreme. There were no discussions, no accusations, no confrontations, no arguments, no nothing - except the wife clearing out so the story can concentrate on the husband.Other than that, I think it was very interesting - dare I say funny at times - story.If you liked 'Cold Pursuit', you really should try to see 'Kraftidioten' (In Order Of Disappearance).

I wonder if a directors cut exists and if it is any better or much worse; my guess would be the latter if it is just more of what was already seen.

It keeps playing with your expectations a bit, and I like how some characters just disappear (as a nod to the original movie it's based on).
The music is also very good and plays an essential part in setting the mood, together with all the snow. Some quite clever writing went into it.

There is a very thin red line of balance between the dark humor and the drama, which makes it a pleasure to watch.Unfortunately none of this can be said about this movie. The plot is almost the same as the original, replacing the norwegians with americans, and the serbians with native americans (Indians). The problem for me is that the balance is lost: the dramatic scenes are not funny. When somebody is killed it is not enough to show his name on a black screen to make it comical. You need to make the whole process absurd and grotesque which is not the case unfortunately. The whole impresion is tragically tedious and not funny.There are of course good things - Liam Neeson's acting is very good.

This review is no exception. Similarities aside, it's the cliches in ""Cold Pursuit"" that really get under my skin as a viewer, or, more specifically, the over abundance of them. There's the stereotypical Italian mob boss, the stereotypical side story of child custody, as well as the stereotypical son who has aspergers, because if there's one thing cinema is dying for, it's autism, and the stereotypical Liam Neeson is searching for/avenging a loved one plot, etc., etc.. However, you have to admit, Neeson plays these roles damn well. Also, Hans Petter Holand definitely tried. And in some spots, he succeeded. Keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, giving them a few good, sometimes racially based laughs along the way (""Do you have a reservation?"" , the clerk asked the Native American), etc. But the problematic feeling of resemblance to countless other titles, cliches, or what have you really bring the film down.

And that's ok, because I love all those movies. Except for this one.The revenge amounts to ""beats a guy until his mouth and/or nose bleeds. Then kills him."" repeated several times.The unique aspects of the snowplowing/snow/winter seem out of place - more like, ""we had to throw Liam in a different locale so it didn't seem shameless.""Many of the plot points seem poorly thought out - his brother is killed and in the very next shot, he's at the brother's grave with the wife who spits on it and disappears. His own wife leaves him 1/3 of the way through never to be seen again. The son who's killed is murdered over his connection to someone else at the airport which is never fully explained. That other someone escapes the van and then, apparently, hides out for days in a garage until Liam is ready to kill himself. And yet he knows everything that has happened. Huh?So, is it worth seeing?

573,minutte,Cultural differences don't translate well,5,29 November 2020,"I watched the movie after I was told that Hans Petter Moland had directed in USA a remake of his own Kraftidiotene movie.watching Cold Pursuit after Kraftidiotene doesn't work well for the former, because it is almost a copycat.
Done by the director of the original but you don't do twice exactly the same work and the difference is that Kraftidiotene has the typical dark and sarcastic humour of most Moland movies and a very idiosyncratic european and scandinavian spirit.
Stellan Skarsgård, a swede, fits very well in these roles of dark comedy like for instance another collaboration with Moland ""En ganske snill mann"". In Kraftidiotene, intra-scandinavian differences and quirks play a role: Nils is a swedish ""immigrant"" in a norwegian district, the hired killer is dane (yet of japanese background) and there are plays around linguistic quirks. The ex of the maffia boss is also a Dane in Kraftidiotene. The thai wife of Nils brother it's an instance of quite some guys in midlife here in Europe getting another younger wife from south-eastern Asia, and so compared to norwegian rural small villages, total change of context.
In the beginning of the movie the initial parting of Nils wife is better set in light.
Then the competing maffia clan in Kraftidiotene are balkanic with Bruno Ganz doing a fine acting.
All in all there's some spirit and quirks that work very well in the original and scandinavian context, and that may not be translatable in american.
The other way around, couple things in Cold Pursuit must be americanisms, because me, totally unknown with USA, didn't get them.
Couple other small things in Kraftidiotene are missing in Cold Pursuit, I guess because american puritanism.Liam Neeson does a good job, but it's a totally different context that the one allowing the synergy of Moland with Skarsgård in Krafidiotene. Skarsgård has something unique in the dark comedic field (and in other cases in full dramatic roles like ""Insomnia""), that Liam Neeson doesn't render equally well.To summarize, it's obviously a try at remaking for the american market a movie that was noticeable and very good in a smaller european market, but then there are all the cultural differences....",Cold Pursuit

583,nlmachen,Top 5 Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,2,9 February 2019,"Okay so let me help some people out since the reviews are back and forth on this movie. This movie is supposed to be an ""action thriller"" with humor involved. I love comedy movies and I love action thrillers too, but somehow putting these two together with Liam Neeson was absolutely painful. Put it this way, probably six or more people walked out of the theater during the movie. The rest of us were astonished at how bad it was and could not stop laughing at it, so we couldn't leave. The older couple in front of me said that it was the worst movie they have ever seen.To make some sense of it, the movie was just flat out weird. I guess if you walk into it knowing that it is a weird/comical movie then it wouldn't be as bad, but when you are expecting a typical Liam Neeson good plot, action movie, don't waste your time or money. There were a lot of parts that I laughed at but I think it was more of the fact that I could not believe what was going on. It was like ""Austin Powers"" meets ""Taken"".I do have to say though, the ending was one of the greatest things I have ever seen for a dumb movie. I about peed my pants and the whole theater was laughing because we could not believe what we just saw. So for that, I will give it a 2/10 instead of a one star.

Cold Pursuit masquerades as an action/drama when it is actually a very dark comedy; and that's the point. It doesn't pander to those who don't get it (which I have to admit was me from time to time). Each character is deep, vibrant, (funny) and pivotal in some way and Neason's character conveys a simplicity that keeps you grounded through his adventure. You'll have a great time if you go into this movie with no expectations and inhibitions freed. This movie is a low and slow boil that is all about the journey and not the destination. My one criticism would have to be a pacing issue in the second act- but that's a bit knit-picky. This movie is exactly what it's trying to be.",Cold Pursuit

The film has a series of actions, a little dark humor and an interesting story of revenge. If you are a fans of the action genre, you will play this film to watch in theaters or on your laptop.
Cold Pursuit isn't like the usual revenge films. This is more of the action drama than an action thriller, and although there are not too many twists and turns, the plot remains alive with full action, great performances and quite heroic actions by actors.I was rather surprised after knowing that this film was a film whose director also made the original film, The title is In Order Of Disappearance which was made in Norway. It is quite seen that Cold Pursuit is a fairly solid entertainment film, especially for fans of the action film Liam Neeson.Cold Pursuit, as a whole, is an entertaining action drama that talks a lot about revenge without being too loud.Liam Nesson as Nels Coxman is very professional in carrying out his role in many action films, I have watched in several films who liam nesson as the main role.There are many advantages in this film but there are disadvantages,I think the lack of this film is a lot of missing stories and made me wonder , such as the departure of coxman wife, wingsman death and others.

No reasoning at all, just for some Intel. So boring.Then the main antagonist is a posh rich man who is trying to convey himself as a bad guy yet all he does is bang on walls and kick blow up balls.

Like Taken, only he has no special skills other than snow-plowing. Like The Grey, in that it takes place in snow and has even more terrible nihilistic philosophy. And like Rob Roy, in that it's about revenge, but mostly is just forgettable.
Liam mails it in. The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, but doesn't understand violence or crime or criminals. Everyone else is just kind of there, waiting to die and fulfilling stupid roles. The kid is okay, but is given terrible lines and towards the end, ridiculous motivation. Some cops are in it for some reason. Then a Native American mafia shows up, and you think maybe this has some politically correct agenda to push, but they too, are pointless. (Except for one good ""reservation"" joke).
It's just revenge. Save your energy and go back and watch Kevin Costner's Revenge (1990), which I can't believe has the same score.

The original film was built on the cold and dry demeanour of the Scandinavians. This hardly works when translated in Hollywood.
Examples abound:
The Indian boss talks too much. In fact, everyone talks too damn much in this film, things that are best left for the audience to figure out. I guess that's a no-no in Hollywood. That's very patronising IMO. ""What are you doing? My job."" Is this a Kung Fury reference?
The scene where the baddie KOs his ex-wife is replaced by her dodging him and attacking him instead. Flower power!
The distinctly Scandinavian architecture remains but is in Colorado now, apparently.
The kid is driving a snowplow at the end, is this an attempt to be funny?

669,kolevjavor,100% COPY!,2,7 February 2019,"I urge viewers to go on Netflix and see the original, ie the Norwegian movie ""In order of disappearance'. ""Cold Pursuit"" is 100% copy of it, most lines, even camera angles. My question is - is this allowed? Probably yes, if the copyright owners are paid again. But, why is this copycat necessary? The original movie has superb actors and storytelling, otherwise it would not have been copied. Does Cold Pursuit target viewers who are lazy to read and must avoid subtitles?",Cold Pursuit
670,jojjetheone,This remake is as bad as kraftidioten,1,14 March 2019,This movie is just stupid. Cant understand that they decided to remake this one. This is as bad as Stellan Skarsgård movie from 2014. The script is just weird. People are like stupid stereotypes and The caracters are over The top. Nothing makes sense in The movie. The only good thing in The movie is The photo that was very georgous.,Cold Pursuit

Dumb humor, nothing at all like what we expected out of a movie Liam would be in. Poor acting- so disappointed- I'd say one of the worst movies I've seen. 👎",Cold Pursuit
673,makercarol,Why to do a Copy?????,5,4 March 2019,"This is a copy of a Scandinavian movie In ""Order of Disappearance""
Everything is same: jokes, script, action, dialogs... I really liked the original one. We do not have to applause this Remake, because it didn't do everything, just changed actors and Albanians in to Indians. Why did they filmed it? Better watch the original, much more better, classic and more realistic.
The classic one slaps woman's face, not man's balls!!",Cold Pursuit
674,nflevr,Better than I expected,8,4 May 2019,I like these type of vendetta movies. I have seen all Liam's flicks and don't tire of them although even though predictable and somewhat shallow most are this one in particular shows off the harsh winters in Colorado.... I didn't realize that they accumulated so much snow in the winter. It was great entertainment though as most know... far fetched. The supporting cast added credence especially Tom Jackson as White Bear. I love natives in movies. This flick is very violent but has quite of few funny / light moments. The popups after each death is very creative. This film reminded me of the Fargo movie and television series. It deserves better than the current 6.3 rating.,Cold Pursuit

Man.PLEASE do NOT waste your money on this absolute piece of garbage!I have never reviewed a movie but after just wasting almost 2 hours of my life on this BORING and UNFUNNY movie, I feel like I owe my fellow human beings the courtesy of warning them.The trailer for this movie is completely deceiving. It makes out like it's an action movie in the revenge genre worth seeing. It's not.It is a boring, slow, unfunny, stupidly written movie. The characters are so easy to hate. The dialogue is just bad on every level. I wanted every single person in the movie to die - not just the 'bad' guys.It felt like an eternity watching this thing.I was deceived by the good reviews on IMDB. They have to be fake.The whole cinema did not laugh once at the absolutely appalling jokes and attempts at humour.The kills were few and far between, so you didn't even have action to make up for the bad jokes.Just don't see it. Watch some paint dry instead - you will thank me.",Cold Pursuit

Made me wanna leave in the middle along with my friends and all people around me in the theatre were discussing how bad and boring of a movie it is!",Cold Pursuit

The acting was absolutely shocking, particularly of ""Viking"" who seemed to be doing a very bad impression of Gerard Bulters Joker from suicide squad eg - weird voice, creepy psychopath.
However the young boy actor was endearing and entertaining.

686,wendyksmith,Do NOT waste your time,1,13 July 2019,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, and I am extremely disappointed Liam Neeson chose to act in it. The writing was POOR, and it was about as crass as you can get. There is literally nothing redeeming whatsoever in the characters or storyline, and everything just falls apart. The majority of characters die a gruesome death, and you get to the end of the movie and can't believe you WASTED two hours of your time.",Cold Pursuit
687,fineschi-97381,Corn Brother's needn't be worried.,2,9 November 2019,"I ordinarily love Liam Neeson films. Yes they can be cheesy and mostly unbelievable but he is a great actor and makes the films watchable & enjoyable.
However THIS movie was a complete crap show. Tom Bateman is hideously annoying & unbelievable in his role. I cringed every time he was onscreen.
Overall I felt like it was trying to replicate Fargo with the dark humour and setting. But as my review is titled; the Coen brothers have nothing to fear as this film is atrocious.",Cold Pursuit

691,freedom-89732,Not good,6,29 July 2019,"Starts out really good, with Neeson as the usual man on a mission and exacting brutal vengeance on a few men. But after that it shifts attention to too many needless peopl mainly for comedic effect, but apparently to advance the story by inches to avoid Neeson's character from appearing to be to powerful to get things done alone. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work here sinc these side events don't feel parallel to the main story or interesting. For example, a female cop, portrayed as eager and hard- nosed, is constantly discovering bits of info related Neeson's son death, even confronting him out of the blue about it, appearing suspicious of him for some eason, but nothing ever happens after that. What was the point? Then the 2nd half really gets dragged on by too much forced attention on the Native Americans and the same old ""white men took everything"" story (I don't want to sound insensitive but it was too out of place), and a kid that would've been better off staying on the sidelin had relatively high hopes for this movie, and was left disappointed.",Cold Pursuit
692,sindrelindb,The trailer spoils 80% if the action,6,28 February 2019,"Was prepared for an action movie, but I'm impressed and surprised by how little action and awesomeness this movie has.

693,ssaass-38838,Disappointing,5,13 September 2020,"What can i say? The original is much better. Things are changed and characters added for No reason. It does not add to the plot. This version feels way darker than the original, which is meant to be a comedy, but perhaps i Just dont get the humor in the remake. This is my favorite movie so maybe i judge bit harshly, but i really feel like the remake is boring, unfunny and changed for the worse. This is of course my biased opinion, but if you love this movie you should really watch the original. It truly is much better.",Cold Pursuit
694,miningbrats,Clever and funny if you pay attention,10,11 February 2019,"We two 70+ women expected a Liam Neeson shoot em up but instead we found a movie that was quick, funny, and with a simple arc. The title was a simile for the response of the bereaved father and quirky elements were everywhere, from a blank good-bye note, to Yelp-savvy Ute drug runners. It just went on and on! Right down to the death representations over each dead druggie, Christian, Jewish etc. A very cleverly crafted movie without Hollywood flourishes. Excellent writing, design and casting. Thanks so much!!",Cold Pursuit
695,quakerboy,The Norwegians got it right.,2,7 May 2019,Even though every scene is copied almost exactly from the original Norwegian film 'In Order of Disappearance' - 'Cold Pursuit' pales in comparison. Liam Neeson's role was played much better in the original by Stellan Skarsgard. The original film did a superb job at combining black comedy with the humourless mood of Nordic noir where 'Cold Pursuit' even with the same script and scenery seems more like a soap opera.,Cold Pursuit

701,lmbrumley,STAY HOME ON THIS ONE,1,10 February 2019,"IT IS TRULY BAFFLING THAT THIS MOVIE IS GETTING POSITIVE REVIEWS... I'm a huge fan of quirky/violent movies, but this dysfunctional version of a Tarantino or Ritchie film falls short of even providing 2 hours of entertainment. The characters were not at all convincing, even as caricatures. The dialogue was entirely devoid of wit, & was so bad it was painful.Humor was jr high level at best, HOW MANY TIMES can you use a character's response to girly or out of place music to get a laugh??? It's a travesty that Neeson spent his time on this, of whom I have been a long time fan.LET ME CONCLUDE WITH THIS:
More than several people walked out of the theater in the first half hour, & those who stayed were using words like ""awful"", ""terrible"", & ""waste of time.""SAVE YOUR MONEY, YOU DESERVE BETTER.",Cold Pursuit
702,markfiorentino,Bulletproof,9,18 February 2019,"If you think Neeson is a skilled killer, you are wrong on this one. He's neither a CIA trained retired agent, nor a trained Assassin, or a a Mafia Hitman. But he will murder them all.He's just the town's plowman. And after the unfortunate death of his son, he starts killing all the bad guys. So far this is another Neeson movie. But the way he kills and the dark humour of each death, make this movie a one of a kind.Yes, this is Liam Neeson, an action movie actor. Yes, this is a ""dark comedy"" film.

The type that you messed with the wrong person and then for some weird alignment of the stars, what that person did created confusion within the drug organization thus creating the perfect chaos.
Imagine Liam Neeson in a Taken movie but already on his retirement , and his kid got taken and he was like "" not again!"" and went on a killing spree , but this time he's old. So everything is slow.

At first I thought this movie was just too violent for me but the writing was brilliant and contemporary and VERY funny. I couldn't stop thinking about the threat of a poor Yelp review, or don't kill the messenger, or a code of ethics among hit men or a kidnapped little boy telling his captor about ""Stockholm Syndrome"", or (and this was my favorite) a blank good-bye note. You know what I'm talking about if you've seen it. And through it all, Neeson is the righteous, dead serious, avenger. The supporting cast was terrific. On top of that, it was beautifully filmed. If you liked Pulp Fiction or Fargo, you're gonna love this. I'm giving it eight stars. It was pretty bloody. But don't let that stop you from laughing.",Cold Pursuit

Why was the son actually killed... It's just killing for killing, no plot is really developed. It's almost comical, apart from the fact that the movie isn't really a comedy.
