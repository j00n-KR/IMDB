0,TheLittleSongbird,One of the better Brosnan Bonds,8,18 August 2010,"I consider GoldenEye the best of the Brosnan Bonds, but this entry isn't half bad either. It has some terrific cinematography and locations, a great score and theme song, a good script and some excellent action. In general the plot is not too bad, the first half was gripping and plausible, however with the transition from Europe to Asia the film loses its way. Also I found Elliot Carver rather nonthreatening and somewhat pathetic as a villain though Jonathan Pryce did well with what he had. That said, Pierce Brosnan is excellent as Bond and Terri Hatcher is a great match for him. And the support of Judi Dench goes down well too. Overall, very good on the whole. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Tomorrow Never Dies
1,bkoganbing,Pump Teri Hatcher For Information,6,18 June 2009,"Jonathan Pryce as Rupert Murdoch like international media mogul quotes William Randolph Hearst's famous maxim about 'you furnish the photographs, I'll furnish the war' in Tomorrow Never Dies. In fact those words are the paradigm of this particular adventure for famous fictional British secret agent James Bond.007's mission and he has no choice, but to accept them is to prevent a war starting between the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom. After a British submarine is sunk, apparently by the Chinese, tensions start building between the two powers. It's up to Pierce Brosnan to prevent things from boiling over.Judy Dench as M has Bond in mind for this mission because it turns out that Mrs. Pryce played by Teri Hatcher had been Bondified a few times back in the day, but the relationship has long cooled down. Dench knows that Pryce is involved some way and she wants Bond to find out how even if he has to 'pump' the wife to do it. One of the man lines of innuendo that pepper this and many other a Bond feature.The Chinese also have an agent working on the same lines in the person of Michelle Yeoh. Brosnan and Yeoh are forced to work together on this one and each proves to be something of a savior of the other.Tomorrow Never Dies shows Brosnan off to good advantage and also shows why the public demand for him to play 007 was almost irresistible. I don't understand why he still isn't doing it.",Tomorrow Never Dies
2,Leofwine_draca,"Brosnan's best Bond film, with plenty of great action",8,15 November 2016,"Brosnan's second outing as the world's favourite super-spy is a ferocious, rip-roaring action yarn that definitely requires a little more work on the plot side of the film. Basically, there isn't one. It's about Brosnan going after newspaper giant Jonathan Pryce – who plans to create a small war in the China seas to sell his paper using bad news – and the series of set-pieces and high-octane battles that rapidly follow. The pacing certainly isn't a problem, with things opening with an ill-advised shoot-em-up involving a plane and closing with one of those clichéd one-man-boards-the-enemy-boat-and-destroys-it-singlehandedly sequences which seems to go on forever. Director Roger Spottiswoode can be relied on to deliver plenty of breathless action but always leaves the characters a raw deal. Never at one point do we really find ourselves engaged in what's going on up on screen, instead it feels a bit like the straightforward cartoonish adventures that Hollywood make oh so well.Brosnan has some good scenes as Bond and handles himself well in the comedy and action stakes. It's the best performance he gave as Bond. The supporting cast includes an irritating and overacting Pryce as the laughing bad guy, his performance buffoonish rather than vaguely threatening, a far cry from the usual assured turns he delivers. Similarly, Teri Hatcher is poor in a poorly-written role, her character's death making no emotional impact on Bond or the audience whatsoever. There are some interesting villainous henchmen – Gotz Otto is a fine right-hand man but needs something to make him memorable (a killer bowler, metal teeth, metal arm, something of the kind), Ricky Jay wasted as a computer technician, Vincent Schiavelli hilarious as a professional assassin – and a feisty female sidekick in the welcome Michelle Yeoh, who gets to show off her trademark high-kicking martial arts skills. There's even a cameo from action choreographer and Shaw Brothers icon Phillip Kwok, which I was delighted about.The action fan will also be entertained by the endless punch-ups and machine gun battles, the action here displaying some affection for John Woo's stylised two-guns-blazing OTT choreographed battles. The various chase sequences are excellent, with the highlights including a great motorbike chase through Beijing and a wondrous episode in a parking garage involving Bond's super-duper new Aston Martin. Overall, it's not quite a classic, but for the somewhat lacklustre Brosnan era it's a winner.",Tomorrow Never Dies
3,SnoopyStyle,passable Bond movie,6,25 November 2013,"Pierce Brosnan continues his cold detached smirky version of the iconic 007. This time the bad guy is crazy media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) who intends to start a war between Britain and China. He uses the GPS system to fool a British warship to enter Chinese waters. To investigate the incident, the Chinese sends in secret agent Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) while Bond uses Mrs Carver (Teri Hatcher) who is actually an old flame.This one has a silly bad guy, and an unconventional Bond girl. They have to give Carver a reason to do what he does. How can we believe all these people are willing to start WWIII for nothing more than money? They have to give him a purpose for revenge. How could he guarantee that this thing doesn't spiral out of control into a nuclear nightmare? It's a dangerous plan for somebody who could lose everything just as easily as gain.The Bond girl is as iconic as Bond himself. Teri Hatcher would be a barely passable Bond girl, and Michelle Yeoh is throwing the concept completely overboard. Michelle Yeoh is necessary for the story and is pretty good for the purpose. I would probably pick somebody more exotic than Teri Hatcher.The action is good. The story is convoluted. In short, it's a Bond movie. As such, it has watchability but it's not in the top ranks of Bond movies. I would pick GoldenEye over this one.",Tomorrow Never Dies
4,Horst_In_Translation,Brosnan's second turn as 007 about as good as the first,6,28 May 2020,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is a British/American co-production from 1997, so this movie is already easily over 20 years old and of course, as you can also see from the picture here on imdb, this is another James Bond movie. These approximately two hours were the second 007 movie starring Pierce Brosnan. And while he was up against one of his (former) own in the first, the opponent here could not be any more different to him, even if they both had a soft spot for Teri Hatcher's character. But first things first: The director here is Roger Spottiswoode, a really prolific filmmaker, but this is his only 007 movie. In contrast to that, writer Bruce Feirstein has worked on several others and was basically always there when Brosnan was. Interesting also to see one single writer in charge of 120 minutes here when you see sometimes half-hour projects credited with three writers. Good for Feirstein then as he probably could get his vision to come fully into effect.Now the main antagonist I mentioned earlier is played by Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce, who very recently scored his first Oscar nomination. In this film here, he plays a media mogul who thinks that knowledge and information equal power. He clearly despises physical strength, but is off the opinion that real power is created by the brains and certainly also by money, but not by muscles. The best example, though almost a bit childish, is when he imitates one character's martial arts moves. So there are clear differences compared to Brosnan's previous film, but the idea that his turn as 007 is basically taking Bond into the (then) new digital world is a similarity and I am curious to see how this idea is pursued in the following films. It's not the first time I watched them / will watch them, but my memory is not so great there. At the same time, while the center of the story is in a way you would never have found in Connery or Moore films, they tried to create parallels to the traditional Bond films when it comes to the smaller moments and attention to detail. Götz Otto plays the villain's most influential helper and there are clearly parallels to the characters played by Ronald Rich and obviously Richard Kiel, maybe even Harold Sakata, even if this fella here had far more firepower and never really relies on skills or physical strength (except his last fight) and perhaps that is why he did not feel as interesting as most of the guys I just mentioned.One character who almost overshadowed him, although he only has one scene, is the one played by the late Vincent Schiavelli. An actor who is always easy to recognize and he was pretty amazing in his scene. Shame on me that I totally forgot he was in this movie. Or in a Bond film in general. His turn as Dr. Kaufman, a forensic scientist and contract killer, was so nice because already the introduction with the fake news television sequence was pretty memorable. Then he came in and things got even better. How he apologizes for these incompetent fools outside not being able to open the car is pretty hilarious. And I sure agree with Bond that this man also would appreciate torturing Bond and be very skilled at it. But it did not go this far. However, it must be said that Schiavelli's character really got way closer to killing Bond than almost everybody else throughout the franchise and it was just the failure from others that saved 007's life there. Not Kaufman's failure. He would have finished his job for sure. By the way, when the action immediately afterwards moves outside and we see Bond get away in the car by driving it, although not at the wheel, had a lot of ""Knight Rider"" to it. And the bad guys standing there helplessly, already when they have no clue how to open it, sure looked like fools, just like they did earlier on when they start beating up Bond, but are eventually inferior to the agent. That room was soundproof they said and later on we have a stealth watercraft, so Carver (Pryce) sure knew how to prevent his actions from being recognized. Or only recognized if it happens the way he wants it to happen, especially with the television report and newspaper article about Bond's alleged death. That sure backfires with M's final statement about Carver's death. Judi Dench had a few fun moments again.As for Carver, his idea of performing in the unknown is also at the center of the story. He tries to use weapons to have China and the UK enter into a war by attacking their military and make it look as if they attacked each other. And while the Cold War days are over here, this is still another aspect from the old films where villains tried to do the same to have the Soviet Union and United States go against each other. Another parallel is that Otto's character lives longer than his boss and this also happened frequently with the biggest henchmen in the old films. Or that they bring slightly beloved characters back from the previous movie although obviously the guy at the airport (he was in the film before that too right? Yes, Jack Wade. They used him before they brought Leiter back.) has nothing on Sheriff Pepper and Jaws. By the way, just saw Gerard Butler and Hugh Bonneville played minor characters here, really? Okay, just a random snippet of information. As for the regulars, Moneypenny was not a factor this time and Q, although he had okay screen time, was not as entertaining as he is in other films. He sure won't be amazed about what Bond did to his super special car. Not too much to say about them this time, so I shall come up with a few more words on Pryce's Carver. He was alright as a villain I suppose, maybe a bit on the gimmicky side, but tolerable. He is married to Teri Hatcher's character, but he kills her after she betrays him and I think that the villain is really together with a Bond ex is something unusual. Sure the villain's girls keep falling for Bond in all kinds of movies, but this was different. What wasn't different is that the bad guy is not scared of killing said female character (just like Goldfinger), which proves that he is quite a sociopath, does not really love anybody except himself and is a cold-blooded narcissist with no morals.Hatcher's character was admittedly not written the very best way. Her questions to Bond in their final scene about why he left her were already a bit on the cringeworthy side. If she got too close etc. The first 45 minutes or so are about her and then Michelle Yeoh takes over as the Bond girl and she stays it until the end. There is no other, just very briefly a blonde at the beginning who has some fun with Bond in the bedroom, but 007 leaves her right away as well. As for Yeoh, it makes sense she is in here as she is the one from the Chinese side trying to figure out what's going on. The usual. She is playing a bit hard to get, but eventually falls for Bond's charm too and they end up together in the final scene. And for once, they do not get caught by their secret services, so they hide successfully, which does not always happen. Bond is pretty gifted no matter what skill is required, but he always gets caught when in the sack with stunning women by his MI6 fellows. Here only Moneypenny catches him over the phone early on. What I actually wanted to say: Connery has a film with Asian Bond girls, so does Moore and now Brosnan as well. Certainly not a rarity like black Bond girls. What else? I would say I was entertained nicely here overall, even if Brosnan is probably still my least favorite Bond. I like the actor in fact, but when it comes to portraying 007, I like the others more. Just read he would like to appear as a villain in a Bond film someday. Could it happen? Oh yeah, the song: Sheryl Crow's number here has the same title like the movie and it was nominated for a Golden Globe which meant the biggest success in terms of awards recognition for this film, but lost to Dion's Titanic evergreen. Sadly, this song was not used anymore in the movie I think. Often they used the tune in the background, but not with this one here. A bit of a pity as I like it.Again, back to Carver (:D), he is really an unlikable guy. I described his character early on, but while he is really powerful, he is also a weakling physically and despite how rich he is, he always felt a bit like a leech to me, perhaps also because of how he rages and his anger attacks are really more funny than intimidating. But this is not Pryce's fault. It's alright. It's the way the character was written. As for Yeoh, I liked her here and always thought she deserved a better career, at least as big as Lucy Liu's. The shower scene was pretty random, but also pretty hot. She is a contender for my favorite Bond girl from Brosnan's movies and surely better than the one from the previous film. At least the one in the center. Better than Janssen's Onatopp probably not. The opening sequence from TND already shows us a truly different approach. It succeeded in its own right I'd say, but the real charm compared to opening sequences from the classics was missing. It was more like military action, but that's not my genre anyway, so if you like that more than I do, you'll probably appreciate it. Subjective approach here. Oh yeah, one thing I want to say is that this film had many scenes in Germany (also the inclusion of Otto), kinda special for me as a German. Also the amount of scenes that Bond manages to get out of unharmed is ridiculously high again. Almost a bit embarrassing, but hey they can't kill him off and somehow it makes sense. At least a little bit. So yeah, this movie was a bit action heavy overall: the Knight Rider scene, the motorcycle sequence (although Yeoh's position was hot and the comments funny) and of course the spectacular finish during which Carver's headquarter blows up. Again, this is entirely subjective, but I prefer quietly convincing Bonds. Or at least a healthy mixture of both, i.e. the way it was handled with Dalton. Or sometimes with Craig. That's all. Watch it nonetheless.",Tomorrow Never Dies
5,classicsoncall,"""The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success.""",7,2 January 2019,"When you stop and think about it, how twisted would one have to be to think that starting a nuclear war was the best way to become the main purveyor of news in a global media world order? Some of these James Bond flick plot lines just boggle my mind. In fact, just about all of them do, even when some of the ideas are recycled from one picture to another. This time out, media magnate Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) attempts to start a war between China and the Brits, and a kicker that Bond (Pierce Brosnan) never expected is that Carver's wife is one of Bond's former gal pals (Teri Hatcher). In true villainous fashion, Carver is not above eliminating his better half when she gets chummy with Bond once again, thereby adding further incentive to stop the evil mastermind.This film in the series has some of the better action sequences you'll come across in a Bond film, which is saying something because they all feature an assortment of insane chases, explosions and general mayhem. Bond's escape with Chinese agent Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) is one of the best action sequences ever, with impeccable timing and magnificent stunt work. It helps that I'm a fan of Michelle Yeoh, but I would have said the same about anybody given the exceptional choreography of that chase scene.It occurs to me that over the course of the past half century of James Bond films that I've generally considered Sean Connery to be my favorite, but now realize that it's more due to the fact that he was the first and the one I can relate to best as being there when the franchise began. But I've got to say, this Pierce Brosnan fellow is a pretty smooth operator himself, and might actually have a leg up on some of the old timers like Connery and Moore. I'm about half way through watching all the Bond pictures in order, and this one could be a keeper.",Tomorrow Never Dies
6,gavin6942,One of the Cooler Bond Concepts,8,2 September 2017,"James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) heads to stop a media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage.The Bond films are both hit and miss as well as an acquired taste. And each time there is a new Bond, people readjust and some people just will not move on. Personally, I think Brosnan was a great Bond, and I actually think this is one of the best films in the series, contrary to popular opinion.Much of the series is either about Soviet issues or post-Soviet issues. This one, however, is about global media dominance. Now 20 years old, it seems more appropriate than ever with its satellites and cell phones. This movie could have been made today with only the most minor of adjustments.",Tomorrow Never Dies
7,jboothmillard,Tomorrow Never Dies,7,12 September 2005,"This is the second appearance for Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. Basically Bond is at first assigned to retrieve a missing encoder that can control the positioning co-ordinates of submarines, and then he is assigned to stop the media obsessed and not very threatening Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) who plans to takeover all media types and bomb some cities. Joining Bond is Chinese agent Wai Lin (Crouching Tiger's Michelle Yeoh) and he has brief help from Jack Wade (Joe Don Baker).

8,ccthemovieman-1,Tomorrow Never Dies.....Neither Does This Film - It Seems To Go On Forever,4,31 August 2006,"Boy, there are a number of reasons I was very disappointment with this 1997 James Bond movie, starring Pierce Brosnan.(1) The previous Bond movie was very good and held promise that the next one would be a good one, too; (2) There was way too much action, with most of it being stupid Rambo-type stuff with hundreds of bullets fired from fairly close range and none of them hitting our hero; (3) The female lead, Michelle Yeoh, was unattractive. That is unheard of, for a Bond movie. (In fairness, I've seen Yeoh in other films and she looked a lot better than she did here. Her main quality in this stupid film was that she can beat up men, one after the other, no male can beat her! Who wrote this script? The wackos at the NOW? (4) There were three usages of the Lord's name in vain. That's three more than normal in a Bond movie and unacceptable. (5) Where was the humor? Usually Bond movies are loaded with it, but not here. Just a few of the normal sexual innuendos early on, and that was it.The best part of the film was watching the featured automobile in here, which was run by remote control. Of course, it was extremely ludicrous but still fun and typical far-out Bond-type silliness. There is a long chase with that vehicle. The action goes on and on. By the last 15-20 minutes, I just fast-forwarded to the ending. I just wanted to get it over with. The title is appropriate: this FILM never dies, never seems to end!",Tomorrow Never Dies
9,Tweekums,"Great action, great Bond girl but a poor villain",7,29 October 2012,"When two Chinese MiGs fly over a Royal Navy frigate in the South China Sea its crew aren't amused as they are in international waters... or so they think. Somebody has sent a false GPS signal sending them miles off course. Before the issue can be resolved a 'sea drill' torpedo is launched at the frigate from a stealth ship; the same ship then downs one of the MiGs. It looks like there is going to be an international incident when the admiralty sends the fleet to the site. M believes the location error could be linked to an anomalous signal sent from a satellite belonging to Elliot Carver, owner of the Carver Media Group Network. Bond is sent to the launch of Carver's new global TV station in Hamburg where he hopes to use his prior relationship with Carver's wife. Here he manages to steal the device Carver's tech-expert Henry Gupta used to send the frigate off course. Comparing its settings with the correct settings he is able to find the frigate's last location... in Vietnamese waters.After parachuting into the sea from high altitude Bond dives onto the ship and discovers one of its nuclear armed missiles is missing. He also bumps into Chinese agent Wai Lin who he first met in Hamburg when she was claiming to be a journalist. When they return to the surface they are captured by Carver's henchman Stamper and taken to Carver's Saigon headquarters. Naturally they manage to escape and learn of the stealth ship... now they just have to find it and expose its presence before Carver can use the stolen missile to start World War Three and become the worlds number one news provider.This, the second of Pierce Brosnan's outings as Bond, has some fantastic action set pieces; the pre-credit sequence quickly grabs the viewer's attention as Bond steals a plane carrying nuclear missiles from an arms bazaar while somebody is trying to garrotte him and a missile is on its way to destroy the site!! The main story opens well with the attack on the frigate; the 'sea drill' torpedo is a particularly inventive weapon. Things weaken however when we learn who the villain is... Carver is just a media mogul trying to be the first with the news by creating it himself and his henchman Stamper is the sort of meat-headed Euro-muscles that seemed de rigour after 'Die Hard'. Jonathan Pryce is a good actor but I don't think he was right for a Bond villain; the character was clearly just insane and only dangerous because of those he employed. The best of the bad guys was the short lived Dr. Kaufman; Vincent Schiavelli put in a delightfully unpleasant performance in the role. All Bond films need Bond girls and Michelle Yeoh was great as Wai Lin; she made the action look easy and her character more than held her own alongside Bond, Teri Hatcher was also good we Carver's wife although she had far less to do and was dead before long. We've come to expect 'witty asides' during these films but here some of them were embarrassingly bad with the sort of sexual innuendo that might make schoolboys giggle but just seemed forced and crude to me.Over all this isn't a bad film and despite its faults the superlative action makes it well worth watching... just hope you don't have to explain the 'cunning linguist' joke to a younger viewer!",Tomorrow Never Dies
10,ma-cortes,Overwhelming and thrilling entry in which Bond/Brosnan goes after a powerful media mogul,7,21 April 2013,"Elloit Carver (Jonathan Pryce) is a megalomaniac and selfish media baron. Carver has the power to reach every person on the planet through his Carver Media Group Network- except for the People's Republic of Chinese who refuse his presence in their nation . The mogul is tied to the disappearance of a British battleship in the South China Sea . James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) heads to stop the media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage and whose tentacles reach around the world . Carver, whose spouse (Teri Hatcher) was a former flame of 007 , is supported by a computer genius (Ricky Jay) and a nasty hunk man (Gotz Otto) . Along the way Bond join forces with a Chinese secret agent (Michelle Yeoh) , expert on martial arts . In addition , there appears the usuals , such as M (Judi Dench), Q (Desmond Llewelin) , Lois Maxwell, ¨MoneyPenny¨ (Samantha Bond) , Minister of Defense (Julian Fellowes) and Jake Wade (Joe Don Baker) . But not counting the regular characters of Bond, Q, M and Moneypenny, this is the first Bond movie to contain absolutely no Ian Fleming references . Likable Pierce Brosnan in an amazing adventure set on wonderful outdoors located mostly on Vietnam , being actually shot in Thailand . The original title of the film was ""Tomorrow Never Lies"", which makes sense when you consider media mogul Elliot Carver was creating the next day's headlines in advance, then causing those events to happen , but a typo on an early script draft was adopted by the producers, and ¨Tomorrow never dies¨ was used instead . This is a Bond's good outing in which faces dangerous adventures around the globe . Brosnan's outing with overwhelming action and spectacular scenarios , the film teams Bond with Michelle Yeoh as endearing ally in an effort to stop a technological communication mogul . After his first introduction in ¨Golden eye¨ as tough and attractive James Bond of the Ian Fleming's famous creation , Pierce Brosnan went on playing various 007 , as ¨Die Another Day ¨ and this ¨Tomorrow never dies¨ . The picture starts with an overblown opening and following other impressive action set pieces . This solid , slick thriller with magic mix of action-packed , dazzling stunts, gadgetry, and romance provided by sexy company as Teri Hatcher and Michelle Yeoh . Pierce Brosnan as James Bond is fine , he does remarkably well , he earns in irony, humor ,suavity and sympathy, however also has coldness ,cunning , intelligence and toughness . Here Bond is an efficient , relentless agent trying to chase obstinately the criminals , traveling around the world as always , as this globe-trotting story is set in Pucket, Bangkok, Thailand (Saigon, Vietnam) , Hamburg , London and many other places . Because the second half of the film is set in Vietnam, the production negotiated for some time for permission to film there ; although it appeared close, the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture and Information eventually refused to allow it , the production decided to use Thailand as Vietnam, with Bangkok substituting for Saigon . Bond to achieve his aims , along the way uses violent means even pulling off brutal killings against enemies who wreak all sorts of havoc . As always Bond will use fantastic gadgets and spectacular cars (here 15 BMW 750's were destroyed in the making of the film) provided by ¨Q¨ (Desmond Llewelyn) . The stealth ship is not a fictional invention , Lockheed secretly constructed and demonstrated one in the early 1980s, but the US Navy finally decided they didn't want any ; the prototype, called the Sea Shadow, was 160 feet long . The picture contains comic-strip adventure , sensational pursuits , silly set pieces , great stunts , tongue-in check humor, automovile chase, frantic unstopped action , a breathtaking tour around the world , amazing gimmicks and stimulating images like are the happenings on the spectacular pursuits on the motorcycle and helicopter . As is like a roller-coaster , as is fast-paced , light , excitement, funny and entertaining ; it's a winner for oo7 fans and non-fans alike . The chase and suspense formula wears strong in this entry .The film made particularly heavy use of gadgetry because some fans thought there was too little of it in GoldenEye . Enjoyable title song by Sheryl Crow and stirring musical score fitting to action by David Arnold , following the John Barry's classic style . Riveting and fancy main titles , furthermore eye-popping production design by Allan Cameron . It's brimming with colorful and fascinating cinematography by cameraman Robert Elswit .

Broccoli ; being professionally made by Robert Spottiswoode who filmed other successes such as ¨the 6th day¨, ¨Turner and Hooch¨, ¨Air America¨ , Shoot to kill¨and Under fire¨ . Robert keeps this moving at an incredibly fast pace and this story about every's favorite super-spy facing off dangerous mogul . The film will appeal to James Bond series's buffs but good for fans only ; because this one goes on far too long and has provoked so much debate among 007 followers .

11,BA_Harrison,Read all about it: Pierce Brosnan in another mediocre Bond fiasco!,5,15 December 2012,"The pre-credits sequence to this Bond adventure, in which 007 (Pierce Brosnan) takes on international arms dealers while an incoming missile threatens to blow them all sky high, is an absolute blinder—so good that, for a minute there, it made me think that this one might more than make up for the disappointment that was Goldeneye. No such luck...Once the opening credits are over, Tomorrow Never Dies takes a nose-dive quicker than Bond in a HALO suit, giving us a lame villain in the form of evil media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), an extremely daft plot in which Carver risks World War III for the sake of a newspaper headline, Bond driving an insurance salesman's car (a BMW 750i), some truly far-fetched action set-pieces (worst of all being the painfully idiotic remote control car scene), more product placement than you can shake a Sony Ericsson phone at, and Teri Hatcher, TV's Lois Lane, as perhaps the most forgettable of all Bond women—Vincent Schiavelli's hit-man did us all a favour when he bumped her off!",Tomorrow Never Dies

What made this picture so good was that it dealt with an important subject matter. That subject is the influence of the media. Jonathan Pryce's insane portrayal of a media mogul trying to provoke China and England into war so that his papers could sell in China was outrageous at best, but it gets us to thinking about the media's influence on events.The dialogue was crisp and there were some memorable lines. Dame Judy Dench as M uttered one by when she was told that she had testicles, her witty reply was that in her case she doesn't have to use them.

13,BandSAboutMovies,A great Bond film,6,19 April 2020,"Roger Spottiswoode directed Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot, which does not seem like a movie that would prepare you for making a Bond film. Nonetheless, this is a fine offering, particularly because of Michelle Yeoh, who plays Chinese spy Colonel Wai Lin.This time, Bond is up against Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), a media mogul who is trying to start World War III to increase his ratings. To top things off, his trophy wife Paris Carver is one of Bond's many ex-girlfriends.After she's killed by Carver's henchman Dr. Kaufman (Vincent Schiavelli), Bond is out not just to solve this case, but for revenge.Ricky Jay shows up in this as cyberterrorist Henry Gupta. He's always a welcome face in films. I'd recommend that you watch Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants, a filmed version of his stage show of card magic. Between acting, writing and becoming the collector of magic information and history, Jay was a fascinating human being.I also find it amusing that Yeoh wasn't allowed to perform all of her own stunts. If you've seen her in movies like Supercop, you'll realize that she's more than the equal of anyone that was doubling for her. That said, she did some of her own fighting. For the fight scene in the bicycle shop, the producers had to call in Jackie Chan's stunt team, because none of the stuntmen wanted to do the full contact style that she had perfected while a member of that group.Here's a strange thing: Sir Anthony Hopkins was cast as Carver, but quit after three days because it was so chaotic. There was big pressure on EON Productions to finish the movie on time, so the script was being written on the fly and new pages were being sent every morning.

Have still not become a Pierce Brosnan fan; but I can change my mind quickly if he continues the level of excitement spent in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Wow, Mr. Bond is back with a bang.Ego maniacal news mogul(Jonathan Pryce)manipulates the news in order to promote his multi-faceted news network. 007 must interrupt the plan designed to start a war between Great Britain and China; thus causing a collapse of the ill intended news service.Brosnan and Pryce projected their characters to the top. I wish that the beautiful Teri Hatcher could have had more time on the screen than she did. Michelle Yeoh is more athletic than actress or a looker. It is good to see Joe Don Baker in his small role. Judi Dench just plain annoys me.I especially liked Bond's getaway scene in his special BMW. The motorcycle chase was also neat. The explosions were of course obligatory.

17,hitchcockthelegend,The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success.,7,28 July 2012,"Tomorrow Never Dies is directed by Roger Spottiswoode and written by Bruce Feirstein who uses characters created by Ian Fleming. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Price, Gortz Otto, Teri Hatcher, Ricky Jay, Judi Dench, Colin Salmon, Desmond Llewelyn and Geoffrey Palmer.Music is scored by David Arnold and cinematography by Robert Elswit.Bond 18 and 007 is called in to investigate media magnate Elliot Carver who appears to be instigating disasters to cause a war between the UK and China.After GoldenEye had broke records and Pierce Brosnan was firmly accepted as the new Bond to usher in the approaching millennium, Eon wasted no time in getting Tomorrow Never Dies into production. Once again another studio had to be built since Leavesden was being used for the Star Wars sequels and Pinewood simply wasn't big enough! A sign that Brosnan's second film was to be gloriously high in production value? Further snags came and went, Vietnam refused permission to film in the country at the last minute and Brosnan got injured but thankfully pulled through to avert further delays. With a script being rewritten daily by Feirstein it appeared to be a jinxed production, the budget went over $100 million, a new record for a Bond movie. Was GoldenEye going to be a false dawn? Was Tomorrow Never Dies going to end up with the bottom feeders of the franchise?As it happens, Bond 18 was a roaring success at the box office, it made $334 million even though it went up against James Cameron's Titanic upon release. Reviews were, and still are, mixed, yet it's one of the Bond films that actually rewards upon revisits if you can forgive the clunkiness of the script in the latter half of the picture. The gigantic budget is up there on the screen, great locations, great casting, amazing stunts, hi-tech gadgets/vehicles and outlandish action sequences. A dynamite score from David Arnold helps as well, unashamedly a big John Barry fan, Arnold brought back some traditional Barry strains whilst putting his own energetic composition into the mix. Sheryl Crow's title song is one of the best of the modern Bond bunch and K D Lang's Surrender is also a fabulous addition to the production. There's great spectacle here, a nice blend of traditional Bond with new age Bond, were it not for missteps in the scripting and unrealised character potential, then it surely would have a better reputation.Michelle Yeoh (Wai Lin) is a fabulous Bond girl, she kick ass, is very pretty and rivals Bond in every department, but she is incredibly underused. The one great ass kicking sequence we get from her only serves to make us lament there's not more. Teri Hatcher (Paris Carver) has all the tools to be another in the line of worthy Bond girls, but she serves only as a plot device to get Bond broody and moody, she's utterly wasted. Pryce is a class act who dominates every scene he is in, but his Elliot Carver's motives and means are weak, and once again we find ourselves with a larger than life villain who we can't accept can give Bond a run for his money. The henchmen score better, though, with Otto's Aryan brute Mr. Stamper a real muscular threat and Vincent Schiavelli's amusing hit-man offering up genuine peril for Bond. Dench continues the good work in Golden Eye as M, Llewelyn as Q gets another round of sparring joyously with 007 and Samantha Bond gets some well written lines as Moneypenny.It failed to live up to the Bondian standards set by GoldenEye, but it is still a great action movie full of vim and vigour and dotted along the way are some truly great scenes. Bond and Wai Lin on a bike, Bond and remote controlled BMW, Bond and Stamper face off and Bond sitting in chair brooding whilst knocking back neat vodka. These are great Bond moments. It loses its way once 007 gets to Vietnam (Thailand standing in) and the gun toting finale is more akin to a Stallone/Schwarzenegger movie, but there's still plenty here to enjoy and be thankful for. 7/10",Tomorrow Never Dies

The plot often borders on the realistic which not something you can say about most Bond films . A media mogul conspiring to cause a war between Britain and China in order to get high news ratings ! Face it , it`s not impossible and there`s no doubt more than a few journalists in the real world are hoping for a war in Iraq so they can get a reputation as a go getting war correspondent . The production values are excellent , the visuals here are far better and slicker than anything you`d find in the Moore films . But the best aspect is the performance of Jonathan Pryce as Elliot Carver . Pryce is one of Britain`s finest and underrated actors and he really shows his joy on screen at being a Bond villain . And anyone who "" Slimes "" President Clinton is my kind of guy .Having said that however I still preferred GOLDENEYE , and I feel somewhat uneasy that the producers didn`t actually realise that this film should be called TOMORROW NEVER LIES",Tomorrow Never Dies
19,LeonLouisRicci,The Good News: It's Safe & Slick......The Bad News: It's Safe & Silly,6,22 March 2017,"The Movies have a Tendency to be Slightly Behind the Times and at times it can be a Glaring Goof. For Example, in this James Bond Film (supposedly known for being AHEAD of the times with gadgetry insights and technological savvy) the Term Internet or its Variations (WWW, Web, etc.) are Never Heard. And this is a Movie about Mass Media???For a supposedly ""State of the Art"" High-Tech Movie in 1997 it's a Head-Scratcher. Pierce Brosnan Returns for the Second Time as Bond and doesn't do much more than ""Suit"" Up and Play Along with the Formula.In Fact in this one He is almost Upstaged (some say He was upstaged) by Michelle Yeoh, a Martial Arts Expert and Asian Film Star. Brosnan also takes a ""Back Seat"" to some Ridiculous Chase Scenes, one on a Motorcycle that is Long and Silly even by Roger Moore Standards.The Villain (the one who fails to notice the internet) is a Media Mogul that is Starting WWIII for, You Guessed it, Ratings. He is Played with some Glee by Jonathan Price, but His sense of Humor is Hardly Cutting Edge. Teri Hatcher does OK as a Bond Girl and Participates in one of the Few Surprises in this Cookie-Cutter Commercialism. M (Judi Dench) has a Commanding Presence and a Good Line or Two. An Aging Q makes only a Brief Appearance. Joe Don Baker Embarrasses Himself and Viewers with another Cameo as a Buffoon (inserted to contrast the Bond's British suave) CIA Agent Felix.Overall, it's an Average Bond Movie that Feels Flat and Uninspired, Void of Wit, and comes off as Cranked Out, Commercialized, and nothing more than what is Expected by the Multitude of Consumers for this Type of Thing.Note...From ""factmonster.com""1995...CompuServe, America Online, and Prodigy start providing dial-up Internet access. Sun Microsystems releases the Internet programming language called Java. 1996...Approximately 45 million people are using the Internet, with roughly 30 million of those in North America (United States and Canada), 9 million in Europe, and 6 million in Asia/Pacific (Australia, Japan, etc.). 43.2 million (44%) U.S. households own a personal computer, and 14 million of them are online.",Tomorrow Never Dies

21,zardoz-13,Pierce Brosnan Doesn't Disappoint in His Second Outing as James Bond,9,16 September 2008,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" doesn't qualify as the best James Bond movie ever, but it easily ranks in the upper five of the franchise. Indefatigably adventurous, this supercharged 18th entry in the long-running United Artists series has shaken up those vintage Ian Fleming plot elements again without stirring the surefire 007 formula. Indeed, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" lavishly maintains those sterling Bond standards. Bodacious babes, stupendous stunts, exotic locales, and audacious adversaries make ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" a tour-de-force escapade. And then there is 007. Reinvented for the 1990s with Pierce Brosnan as the intrepid troubleshooter in director Martin Campbell's ""GoldenEye,"" Bond re-emerged as infinitely resourceful, incorrigibly impudent, and rudely pugnacious. Vulnerability and guilt, however, complicate the Brosnan Bond and made him less remote and more humane. Bond offers some interesting confessions about himself, such as his belief to never argue with women.Global communications tycoon Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce of ""Brazil"") ties to ignite World War III between Red China and England. He wants to exploit the war to christen his new 24-hour satellite news agency as well as bolster his television news ratings. Carver and his techno-terrorists hack into a GPS navigation satellite used by the Royal Navy. One of their ships strays into Red Chinese waters, based on the bogus coordinates fed by Carver's henchmen. Stamper (Gotz Otto), Carver's other henchman, appears on the scene in a super-secret stealth ship. Deploying a torpedo with a giant, triple-headed sea drill, Carver's men sink the British frigate, murder the ship's survivors, hijack a cruise missile, and destroy one of the Chinese Mig jet fighters. More than that, Carver's henchmen make things look as if both sides exchanged shots.Rattling their sabers, the Admiralty ship the navy off to China. They would rather fight to defend their honor than exercise caution. Meanwhile, M (Judi Dench of ""Mrs. Brown"") wants to dispatch Bond (Pierce Brosnan of ""Remington Steele"") to investigate. A high-ranking Minister gives M only 48 hours to avert World War III. 007 flies into Hamburg to attend the opening night gala ceremonies of the Carver Media Group. M suspects that Carver may be at the bottom of all this mayhem. She wants Bond to rekindle an old relationship with Paris Carver (Teri Hatcher of ""Desperate Housewives""), Elliot's wife, and 'pump' her for information.British Intelligence knows that Carver's electronics genius, Gupta (Ricky Jay of ""House of Games""), has acquired a stolen U.S. satellite encoder. The evidence shows that Carver's satellites relayed tampered information, too. Before Bond can save Paris, Carver's henchmen assail him. When the hero and the villain clash as early as Bond and Carver do in ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" you know the writers has done a splendid job of sparking the dramatic tension that exists between the hero and villain.Written by ""GoldenEye"" co-scripter Bruce Feirstein, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" contains a tightly told tale. The story covers less than 72 hours and various deadlines generate a palpable air of tension. Clocking in at two hours, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" qualifies as one of the trimmer Bond outings. ""Air America"" director Roger Spottiswoode keeps the action moving at a breakneck pace. There is a superfluous moment. Everything in the story contributes to the forward momentum of the plot. At times, the filmmakers keep you clued in by having a character comment on the meaning of the action. This is film-making at its finest. Of course, if you've seem one 007 extravaganza, you've seen them all. Bond movies represent a Rubic's Cube of scenes that the filmmakers juggle to suit the newest plot.""Tomorrow Never Dies"" constitutes only the third Bond epic since ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" to use the World War III plot. In those previous Bond outings, 007 has to avert a war, and he donned his British naval commander's uniform to accent the military aura. In his second jaunt as 007, Brosnan shows greater mettle and authority. Lighter than Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton, but darker than Roger Moore and George Lazenby, Brosnan should be identified with the role by the time he makes his third Bond.Jonathan Pryce makes a wonderfully sinister villain. Not as murderously sadistic as Christopher Walken's fiendish brute in ""A View to A Kill,"" Pryce's Carver is reminiscent of the salad days of 007 when stylist actors like Donald Pleasance and Charles Gray played Blofeld respectively in ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever."" They were nefarious but never as vicious as, say, Robert Davi's Sanchez in ""License to Kill."" Pryce savors his share of good lines, such as, ""Let the mayhem begin."" Loosely based on today's media barons, Carver compares himself to William Randolph Hearst, who helped foment the Spanish-American War back in the 1890s. Pryce even has some fun, especially when he mocks Wai Lin's martial arts moves. Michelle Yeoh is suitably tough as James Bond's counterpart in Chinese Intelligence and she has her own bag of gadgets. The downside is Carver has to die. If O.J. could get away with murder, surely Carver could have proved himself innocent of charges that he fanned the flames of a world war. Too bad. The Bond pictures need another resilient villain like Blofeld, and Carver seems like a gifted candidate.Inevitably, Fleming purists will argue the assets as well as debate the debits of ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" Some will love it, and others will loathe it. Meanwhile, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" will do nicely until James Bond returns for ""The World Is Not Enough.""",Tomorrow Never Dies
22,Boba_Fett1138,Barely entertaining enough.,5,17 August 2006,"Pierce Brosnan was one fine Bond, so it's a shame he had to play in two of the worst Bond movies, this one and ""The World is Not Enough"". But of course even a bad Bond remains an entertaining one to watch, with lots of spectacular action, pretty girls and cool gadgets.The story always has been sort of secondary in Bond movies but this one takes the cake. The story is absolutely ridicules and far from well conceived and handled. The idea of an media-tycoon wanting to fully control and create the news for his own personal satisfaction is a totally unlikely but above all a ridicules one. It makes the story as a whole ridicules, even for a Bond movie. The movie is filled with implausibilities and the movie never succeeds in making the story work compelling or engaging.The movie handles lots of things wrongly, mainly things involving its story. I think this is probably due to Roger Spottiswoode's directing, who isn't exactly known as the best director or storyteller around. Lots of fine characters are wasted in this movie. Especially Teri Hatcher as the Bond girl, who Bond actually does have feelings for. Teri Hatcher plays the best and most interesting Bond girl in years but she only is in the movie for about 15 minutes. A real waste of a great and fine looking character, played by a great actress. Instead now were stuck with the bland acting Michelle Yeoh as a Chinese agent, who helps Bond on the mission. No offensive but Bond and Asians never worked out in the movies. There just is no chemistry and it helps to makes the character feel like an obsolete one.Also the villains, a important Bond element, are wasted in this movie. Jonathan Pryce is a fine actor and he plays a great villain but due to the ridicules story, his character never convinces enough. Jonathan Pryce deserved to play a villain in a better Bond movie. We don't that often see him as a villain but with this movie he shows his versatility as an actor and proofs that he can play cold-hearted, ruthless villains as well. The rest of the villains feel more like an obligation than they are needed in the story, with the exception perhaps of the recently deceased Vincent Schiavelli who always is great to watch in any movie.Thankfully some good Bond-regulars also show up again. Judi Dench is great as M and definitely a more serous one than the Bernard Lee M, who obviously mainly often served as a comic relief. They tried to change his character into a more serious one in the later Bond movies and replaced him with Robert Brown after Bernard Lee's death in 1981 and turned his character into a more serious one but none of them worked out quite as satisfying and powerful as the Judi Dench character. She gave the M character more personality and sense of power and control. A woman with balls, you may say. Other Bond-regulars in this movie are; Q (Desmond Llewelyn), Miss Moneypenny (Samantha Bond), Charles Robinson (Colin Salmon) and Jack Wade (Joe Don Baker).The movie begins great and spectacular in perhaps one of the greatest Bond openings. Unfortunately the movie never lives up to its opening sequence, ever again, later in the movie. Basically the opening sequence is the only truly great and memorable sequence of the entire movie. The movie further more is filled with lots of spectacular action sequences and they do entertaining but I simply prefer a good old fashioned fistfight above a machine-gun shootout any day. It makes this Bond movie feel sort of artificial and without any heart or true inspiration. It has all the Bond elements, girls, action, the usual characters and gadgets but still this movie doesn't really feel as a Bond. Also the end sequence, normally the best and most spectacular, are disappointing in this movie and help to make this movie an extremely forgettable one.Visually the movie is good looking and it has some fine cinematography in most of its sequences. Also the effects are good but it's a sort of unwritten rule that how more special effects are in a Bond, the worse the movie is, with some exceptions left out. The musical score by David Arnold is also fine and fitting for the movie. At first I didn't liked any of his Bond scores but they have grown onto me and I really start to appreciate and see the greatness of them all.It's a movie that does entertaining but it doesn't do this consistently throughout the entire movie. It's filled with implausibilities and unlikely elements which causes this movie to have some unfortunately weaker and extremely forgettable moments.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Tomorrow Never Dies
23,oscaralbert,"Though Ms. Moneypenny says, ""You are a cunning . . . """,7,3 April 2014,""" . . . linguist, James,"" this Bond is more of a boy who cried wolf. As Hollywood's ""Charles Foster Kane"" stood in for real-life Sociopathic media mogul William Randolph Hearst, TOMORROW NEVER DIES dresses up actual Fox ""News"" tycoon Rupert Murdoch in Steve Jobs' duds, and calls its megalomaniac Murdoch clone ""Elliot Carver."" Carver plots to put his pawn in power in China to boost the world-wide ratings for his ""Satellite News Network."" Polls show many if not most Americans feel that Murdoch conspired with his plant in the White House to orchestrate the 9-11 attacks to boost ratings for Fox ""News"" and Fox shows, such as ""24."" Seen in this light, TOMORROW NEVER DIES was released much closer to its projected 2001 doomsday year than George Orwell's 1949 alarm bell novel, ""1984."" But, as America turned a deaf ear toward Britain's Orwell (who was tarred and feathered as ""Un-American"" by ACTUAL fascists in Congress), the U.S. was equally oblivious to the underlying warnings embedded within TOMORROW NEVER DIES. As a direct result of this ostrich-like behavior, the promise of brighter Tomorrows died for the United States. One might blame this unfortunate turn of events on American naiveté, its tradition of bullying Truth-sayers, or it's addiction to what Republican President Eisenhower labeled ""the military\industrial complex.""

24,gridoon2021,"Enjoyable, if strictly by-the-numbers, James Bond outing",6,1 December 2008,"Pierce Brosnan's second Bond movie is not quite as good as ""GoldenEye"", mainly because it's so derivative of previous Bond flicks and brings little that's new to the table: the ""play two superpowers against each other"" plot comes straight out of ""You Only Live Twice"", the antagonism-turned-to-attraction relationship between Bond and his leading lady follows the pattern of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker"" (complete with a scene where Bond plays around with his counterpart's gadgets), the chase in narrow and overcrowded exotic streets is reminiscent of ""Octopussy"", etc. It feels as if the Bond producers, anxious to solidify Brosnan's position as the new Bond after the success of ""GoldenEye"", decided to play it safe this time and stick to the formula. On the bright side, this is a formula that (usually) works, and the film is fairly consistently enjoyable. Brosnan is Bondishly Cool: action, fights, luxurious living, flirting with the ladies, emotion, humor, wits - there is hardly an aspect of the role that he doesn't pull off. Michelle Yeoh is also terrific as the main Bond girl; she is gorgeous and nearly unstoppable physically, although her character barely appears during the film's first hour. Jonathan Pryce is more hammy than menacing as the villain, and his plan is not the most sound one (a media baron igniting WWIII just for the ratings?), but he has his moments. Most of the other roles are fairly brief, though credit must go to Vincent Schiavelli for the memorable Dr. Kaufman, and to Judi Dench as M (back in the day where she wasn't in nearly every scene, like it's happening now with Daniel Craig's films). To sum up: a formulaic Bond flick that the capable leads and some admittedly spectacular stunts (like the motorcycle jump over the helicopter) get you through with no problems.

Tricked into believing that the Chinese military was responsible the British send more warships into the area in preparation for a possible war. However, not totally convinced that the Chinese were responsible, the director of MI6 under the code name of ""M"" (Judi Dench) sends ""James Bond"" (Pierce Brosnan) to Hamburg to investigate whether Elliott Carver was somehow involved. To further help with his investigation, he is given a special car from MI6 inventor ""Q"" (Desmond Llewelyn) that has extremely unique properties. Another key element in his favor is that he and Elliott Carver's wife ""Paris Carver"" (Teri Hatcher) were former lovers who still has feelings for him. What he doesn't realize, however, is just how powerful Elliott Carver has become and that it will take all of his resources to not only complete his investigation but also to prevent a full-scale war. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a solid James Bond film which had ample elements of intrigue and action along with a good performance by the aforementioned Pierce Brosnan.

Teri Hatcher plays the industrialist's wife while Michelle Yeoh is on hand as a Chinese agent with whom Bond teams up.""Tomorrow Never Dies"" (1997) is a competent enough Bond flick with loads of action highlighted by the opening terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border, a melee at a newspaper factory in Hamburg, an underwater investigation of a wreck near the South China Sea and a wild motorcycle chase in Saigon with 007 handcuffed to the Chinese agent. Hatcher is another highlight in one of the best ""whoa, mama"" moments in the franchise's history, albeit brief. I also enjoyed the entertaining banter for the first two-thirds of the movie.Unfortunately, the picture lacks the colorful dynamic of pre-Brosnan installments, hampered by a muted grey pall throughout. Then there's the eye-rolling sequence in a parking garage where Bond operates his BMW via remote control while lying in the back seat (Why Sure!). Plus the showdown on Carver's stealth ship in dark waters is curiously dull despite all the ""exciting"" thrills; in other words, it's overkill action garbage.Still, it's a serviceable Bond flick; it's just forgettable and the least of Brosnan's 4-film stint.The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Bayonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France

M her, aid, and the Admerial drag this film, they annoy the viewer with tripe.  Roger Moore added humor and charm, Bronson had nothing to work with in this script.  Bruce Willis could have played the British Gentalmen with this script.  Its not a bad film, but if they want to continue with the series, they need some new blood.",Tomorrow Never Dies
33,Mr-Fusion,"All the Bond tropes, as per the manual",5,12 November 2015,"Coming off the heels of ""GoldenEye"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" always felt to me like a by-the-numbers OO7 entry. the filmmakers know what we've come to expect from a Bond film and it confidently delivers: high-end extravagance, globe-hopping, explosions, lots of shooting. And it's fairly methodical in that respect. even the quips are businesslike. And while we're talking about ""GoldenEye"", Bond is much less of a precise gunman; here, he just picks a direction and sprays. It's probably nitpicking, but that's always jumped out at me.Brosnan's still great, but it's his fellow actors that get the shaft. Michelle Yeoh's a Hong Kong badass who's always getting saved, and Jonathan Bryce is playing a media tycoon bent on world domination. Sure, he's mean about it, but c'mon, Bond's fighting Rupert Murdoch. It's lame! Not really a bad movie, but also pretty forgettable.5/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
34,SimonJack,Non-stop action Bond,8,15 March 2018,"This is the second James Bond film by Pierce Brosnan. It firmly plants the 007 series in the modern milieu of non-stop action for mystery, adventure, crime, and assorted other genres of film. One can hardly catch his or her breath between the fast action scenarios.This film had some 50 shooting locations. Outside of three different studios in England, scenes were shot at several sites elsewhere in the U.K. Other filming took place in Florida of the U.S., France, Germany, Mexico, and Thailand.This film was the first to introduce Michele Yeoh (as Wai Lin) to international audiences. The true-life martial arts specialist and trained ballerina had been starring in Hong Kong films for more than a decade. Her recognition spread further in 2000 with her female lead in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Although she continued to appear in many martial arts action films, she also has had some dramatic roles. Among them were ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" in 2005 and ""The Children of Huang Shi"" in 2008. She is reportedly the only actress that Jackie Chan will allow to do her own stunts in his films.This also is the second 007 film in which a real Bond has a role. Samantha Bond (her real name as well as her stage name) plays Miss Moneypenny. Here are some favorite lines from this film.Q, ""Grow up, double O seven.""James Bond, to Paris Carver, ""I always wondered how I'd feel if I ever saw you again."" After she turns and slaps him, he says, ""Now I know.""Paris Carver, ""Tell me, James. Do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow?""Wai Lin, ""Exactly what kind of banking do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?"" Bond, ""Hostile take-overs.""Henry Gupta, ""I call it Gupta's Law of Creative Anomalies. If it sounds too good to be true, it always is.""Wai Lin, ""It's mostly dull routine, of course, but every now and then you get to sail on a beautiful evening like this and sometimes work with a decadent agent of a corrupt Western power."" James Bond, ""And they say the Communists don't know how to have fun.""James Bond, ""We're gonna finish this together. And if I may say so, you found the right decadent, corrupt Western agent as a partner.""",Tomorrow Never Dies
35,JamesHitchcock,A good example of what the Bond films have always been- superior escapist entertainment,7,15 September 2004,"One of the standard received ideas of film criticism is to say that sequels are almost never as good as the original film. (There are also a few standard exceptions to this rule, such as 'The Godfather Part 2' and the second and third parts of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy). Subject to these exceptions, however, there seems to be a law of diminishing returns to the effect that the more sequels a franchise spawns, the worse they become. The Bond films, however, seem to me to provide the most striking exception to this principle. The franchise started with 'Dr No' in the early sixties, and 'Tomorrow Never Dies' amounts to 'James Bond XVIII', or 'James Bond XIX' if one includes 'Never Say Never Again' in the total. Despite this, one can watch the latest offerings with as much pleasure as the original Sean Connery films from the sixties and seventies. The Bond films are highly formulaic. They typically start with an action sequence before the opening credits that has little or nothing to do with the film that is to follow. The main story will involve Bond thwarting a dastardly plot by some megalomaniac bent on world domination. It will always involve at least one extended chase sequence, and possibly two or more. The main character, apart from Bond and the villain, will always be a beautiful young woman who helps Bond in his quest and who will end up by falling for him. There will always be at least one other beautiful girl, either as a secondary heroine or as a villainess. The villain will always have a small army of henchmen ready to do battle on his behalf. The story will always end with a shoot-out, normally in the villain's headquarters, in which Bond manages to avert the threatened disaster at the last minute.'Tomorrow Never Dies' contains all these formulaic elements. It is, nevertheless, in my view one of the better entries in the Bond canon, for a number of reasons beyond the fact that Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond since Connery. These can be summarised as follows:-1. The Villain. Jonathan Pryce plays Elliott Carver, a newspaper and media tycoon intent on whipping up a war between Britain and China. The reason is to facilitate the accession to power of his ally, a renegade Chinese general who has promised to give his organisation exclusive broadcasting rights in China. Bond villains have always provided scope for some splendidly over-the-top displays of acting, going back to Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb and Gert Frobe's Goldfinger. Although Pryce's Carver is more restrained than some, it falls within this tradition. At first sight the silver-haired bespectacled Carver seems mild-mannered and soft spoken, but soon reveals the raving megalomania which is the hallmark of the Bond villain. Particularly noteworthy is the speech where Carver states his ambitions as being 'power' and 'world domination'. Although he puts a liberal, metaphorical interpretation on these two concepts, the audience is left in no doubt that he means what he says quite literally. There is also a good performance from Gotz Otto as Carver's brutal German henchman, Stamper.2. The Girl. Admittedly, Teri Hatcher is rather wasted as the secondary Bond girl Paris Carver, Elliott's wife and a former girlfriend of Bond. Michelle Yeoh, however, is superb as the main female lead, the Chinese secret agent Wai Lin. (That's how it's spelled, although the pronunciation used in the film suggests that the name should actually be transliterated as Wei Lin). Apart from Michelle's striking looks, she is also an accomplished martial arts performer, and her skills are put to good use in this film. (Part of a trend of giving Bond girls a more active role, in contrast to the earlier films in the series where they were required to do little other than look decorative.) 3. The Chase Sequence. The main one, in which Bond and Wai Lin escape on a motorbike through the streets of Hanoi from the villains in a helicopter, is excellent. 4. The Opening Sequence. As usual, this has little to do with the main plot line. It does, however, fit in with a growing tendency in the Bond films, that of mocking or undermining the militaristic, macho values which the series was once accused of promoting. This film introduces a new comic character, the gung-ho, blustering Admiral Roebuck, a sort of naval equivalent of Colonel Blimp, who clashes with the more liberal 'M', the female chief of the British Secret Service. (I was interested to learn that the actors who play them, Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench, are husband and wife in real life). In the opening sequence, Bond narrowly prevents Roebuck's blundering attempt to bomb a gathering of international terrorists from setting off a nuclear explosion. The more active roles for female characters are also part of the trend towards a politically correct Bond, as is, perhaps, his remark that smoking is a 'filthy habit'. (The earlier films were often criticised for glamorising the habit by making Bond himself a smoker). As with all the Bond films, one can probably pull holes in the plot of 'Tomorrow Never Dies'. (The scene where Carver sinks a British warship by cutting a hole in the side with what looks like a giant chainsaw struck me as particularly implausible. What's wrong with a torpedo?) Nevertheless, the Bond films are not meant to be works of social realism and unlike, say, the novels of John Le Carre, have never purported to give an accurate picture of life in the British Secret Service. 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is a good example of what the Bond films have always been- superior escapist entertainment. 7/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
36,KineticSeoul,"My second favorite ""007"" movie with Pierce Brosnan as Bond",7,14 February 2016,"When I first saw this movie as a kid when it first came out in theaters I was blown away by how entertaining it was. I mean as a kid, watching a cool secret agent drive a car by using a phone as a remote control was just awesome. This is also the Bond movie that showed James Bond is not a smoker anymore. I mean Bond punches a bad guy after lighting his cigarette then says ""filthy habit"". Watching it now, I do see it's flaws. It's still a solid Bond film, but the story and everything else is very narrow and by the numbers. In another words there really isn't much that makes this movie stand out from the other Bond films. There is plenty of action and that includes Michelle Yeoh doing her kung- fu thing. However the main villain this time around...Let's just say a he is not that intimidating but different. It's not a great action movie or anything like that but it's a solid Bond film in the franchise. With the action films these days going over the top with better special effects. It's unfair to compare the standards for the action movies these days to a action movie from the 90's. So I will say ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is a solid action movie from the 90's. I think it doesn't get as much recognition compared the the previous Bond films. And that is because it lacks the memorable iconic scenes in few of the previous Bond films. Overall, this is a action movie from the 90's that is worth a watch.7/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
37,OllieSuave-007,Bond shows tomorrow never dies!,8,11 March 2014,"This is Pierce Brosnan's second movie as James Bond 007. Here, Agent 007 is after media tycoon Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), who wants to complete his global media empire and start a confrontation over British and Chinese waters. Bond teams up with Chinese agent Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) to stop Carver, but things are complicated by Carver's wife Paris (Teri Hatcher), Bond's former lover.There are plenty of nice action sequences and thrilling stunt scenes, as Brosnan and Yeoh make a spectacular duo playing two agents working together to catch the bad guys. The story is fresh and the plot is fast-paced. Yeoh takes the role of a ""Bond Girl"" to a whole new level, making it a butt-kicking, swift and daring, beautiful but dangerous partner to Bond. This is perfect since Carver plays a lead villain that you would really despise. And, it was nice seeing Teri Hatcher of Lois and Clark and Desperative Housewives fame in the film, providing great chemistry with Brosnan. Brosnan, I think, did a better job in this role, bring back some of the charm and suaveness to the character.Overall, it is a pretty good Bond entry and is what I think the best one starring Brosnan.Grade B",Tomorrow Never Dies
38,bensonmum2,"""I owe you an unpleasant death, Mr. Bond.""",5,1 September 2009,"It should be obvious from my rating that I'm not the biggest fan of Pierce Brosnan's second outing as James Bond. It's not that Tomorrow Never Dies is terrible, but compared with the best of Bond (even compared to the best of Brosnan's Bond films), it's just not that good. There's very little that I would call original in the script. It's strictly Bond by-the-numbers. The same tired formula is used with little in the way of a surprise thrown in. Beyond the lack of originality, I've got real problems with Jonathan Pryce as super-villain, Elliot Carver. A megalomaniac news-mogul intent on dominating every news outlet in the world just doesn't instill the same level of fear in me that most of Bond's other adversaries do. And haven't we already seen guys like this? Ted Turner – Rupert Murdoch – anyone? And really, what's the point in Carver's whole plan? First, he's obviously already one of the most powerful, wealthy men on the planet. I mean, he owns a news empire that stretches across the entire globe, save for China. Not too shabby. Second, if you've got the resources and wherewithal to build a stealth ship and no one, including the world's intelligence community, knows anything about it, how much more is there? Finally, what kind of name is Elliot for a man bent on world domination? Elliot is a guy who hands you your soft-serve at Dairy Queen – not some evil genius.The highlight of Tomorrow Never Dies is easily Michelle Yeoh. I know, it's a predictable statement, but she really is awesome. From the motorcycle scene while handcuffed to Brosnan to her fight scene in the secret hideout, she totally rocks. If she could have just seen fit to give old Brosnan a good butt-kicking, I might have rated this movie a lot higher.",Tomorrow Never Dies
39,Lejink,Bond Means Well (Spot The Product Placement),7,21 September 2020,"Second Bond outing for Pierce Brosnan and an entertaining one it is too. The theme song by Sheryl Crow, not one of the franchise's best, eases in after an exciting pre-title sequence where Bond's race against the big countdown to nuclear disaster is actually introduced at the film's beginning and which sees our hero exercise deft piloting skills to save the day.As ever though, that's not the end, as pretty soon a major crisis ensues between Britain and China over a Royal Navy boat lured into Chinese waters by a machine that can misdirect a GPS system, something my car's sat-nav could do for them at a fraction of the cost. Behind this skullduggery for his own ends is big bad media mogul Edmund Carver, played by Jonathan Pryce whose empire stands to gain massively if the two countries end up warring against one another. Bond, in reluctant partnership with Chinese Secret Service counterpart Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin, is given 48 hours to save the day before a likely war erupts between east and west.First of all, let me say I consider Brosnan a good fit for the 007 character. Handsome, not too old, reasonably athletic and able to combine steeliness with wit, he cooly essays the part. Bond girl duties are shared between Teri Hatcher, if only short term and Yeoh whose protestations of resistance ring thinly from the outset. Pryce makes for an excellent villain even if he's not quite bestowed the psychopathic megalomania the part usually calls for, while Gotz Otto follows in the footsteps of Robert Shaw, Bert Kwouk and Richard Keil, although not as convincingly as the big boss's heavy, naturally bound to slug it out with Jamesy boy, of course, just before the end.The action set-pieces, particularly in the first half of the film are excitingly created, including a remote car chase in an underground car park by Bond's new perfectly placed product, a souped-up BMW, a joint escape with Yeoh down the front of a skyscraper and a motorbike pursuit down the Vietnam docks. Some of the dialogue is quick and witty while for humour, I best enjoyed Pryce's ridiculing of Yeoh's Kung-fu-kicking prowess once he's got her captured. The director does however get a bit carried away with the firepower, fireworks and hardware at his disposal and the film does sag in the middle when Pryce disappears from the action for a spell, but unlike other recent Bond features I could name, this one held my attention better than most, mainly due to Brosnan's commitment to the part, the fast paced direction and the chase sequences.For me, definitely one of the better entries in the series.",Tomorrow Never Dies
40,bowmanblue,Brosnan is on a roll,9,15 August 2017,"It was pretty much the general consensus that Pierce Brosnan's first outing as Bond ('Goldeneye') was actually a vast improvement on the brief 'Dalton era' (sorry Tim!). So, there was some speculation as to whether 'Goldeneye' was a fluke or not when it came to the next film in the franchise 'Tomorrow Never Dies.' I think I was as pleased as any Bond fan when I say that I was pleasantly surprised. I could almost say that – overall – 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is actually the highlight of the Brosnan reign.The film does its best to steer clear of the slightly more fanciful notion of a supervillain trying to take over the world, instead choosing for almost satirising one of today's real life media moguls (Rupert Murdoch anyone?) in their attempts to gain global positioning as the one and only source of news for the entire planet. And, in typical Bond style, this isn't done in the boardroom, but by starting a war between the UK and China, then filming the carnage that ensues. But, whatever carnage the villain can create, Bond does his best to match. And he does it very well. If you've seen one Bond film (especially one of the more modern ones with the higher budget) you should know what to expect. You get the fights, the chases and the exotic locations. It's all here for your enjoyment. I'm not dwelling on the details because it's all pretty standard when it comes to Bond films (please don't take that as a put-down of the film – it's actually the opposite!). This could almost be the 'perfect' Bond. That doesn't mean that it's the best of all that have ever been made. It has a formula like the rest and crosses all boxes, it just does it really well and, despite not giving anything that original, still is totally enjoyable – maybe even for people who aren't fans of the series.There are a few things that are 'extra' good about the film, such as the satirical take on the media (obviously filmed before the internet took off and you could probably take over the world or start a war via Twitter). Bond's boss, 'M,' gets more screen time (and with Judi Dench playing the role, then that's no bad thing), plus Michelle Yeoh is possibly the most capable and coolest Bond girl so far. The gadgets and Q are back, even if Desmond Llewelyn is looking more and more frail by now.I didn't see much in the way of negative points, however, if I'm going by other people's opinions of the film, I would mention that some felt than Jonathan Pryce was a little 'weak' as the villain/media mogul 'Elliot Carver.' Personally, I thought he was great, but many disagreed. I always thought that if you wanted to see a truly wooden Bond villain then try 'Moonraker' or 'The Spy Who Loved Me!' Overall, 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is a very solid Bond movie with a breath-taking chase through the streets of China between a motorbike and a helicopter. Brosnan has really hit his stride with this one – just do try not to be too upset by Bond driving a BMW!",Tomorrow Never Dies
41,ThomasDrufke,No News Like Bad News,5,1 November 2015,"A hero is only as good as its villain. Bond films rely on having capable and memorable villains for them to live on like they have. It only makes sense when the villain make sense within the context of the story. Tomorrow Never Dies, like many other Bond films, struggles to ever lift off because of the lackluster baddie. Not at all to the dismay of Jonathan Pryce, who I like in many other things, just isn't given enough to work with here. But make no mistake, Tomorrow Never Dies is an entertaining ride.As much as I haven't been a fan of the Brosnan films so far in my re-watching of every Bond movie before Spectre, his films have benefited heavily from the updated special effects and CGI. I feel as if you put his performance in one of Connery or Moore's films it wouldn't have the same appeal because those films work on levels other than the CGI and action sequences. Nevertheless, Brosnan does at least make for a believable James Bond, though he's nowhere near his predecessors. In this movie, he goes after the leader of a proposed new global network, played by Pryce, in which you get ""tomorrow's news, today"". Which if it weren't for his World War 3 hopes, would be a strange person for Bond to go after. The problem is that I understand this is someone who Bond would go after, but why does Pryce's character want there to be a World War 3? Just for media domination? There was a point where the character was framed to be the next Steve Jobs and compared himself to Caesar, Napolean, and I think even God, but then all of a sudden he wants WWIII. He never seemed crazy enough to do something like that. I like Jonathan Pryce but I think they needed someone a bit more crazy than that. The good thing is that the film contains a ton of action and a very good Bond girl. At the very least, this would be a good cable watch if you were bored one night because the action is great, the film just isn't that intelligent or intricate. On the other hand, Wai Lin, played by Michelle Yeoh, is one of the better Bond girls the series has had in my opinion. Sure, there is an eventual romance, but it's not immediate or forced like so many others. Plus, she can handle herself in the field which makes her all the more bada**.

44,CuriosityKilledShawn,Brosnan's best Bond adventure,7,1 July 2008,"I was never too smitten by Brosnan's Bond during his tenure. For a long time it was hard for me to determine exactly why, but in the 15 years since Die Another Day I've realized what it is. Nothing in his four movie tenure was inspired by the works of Ian Fleming, they were all original screenplays that, in essence, could have been any other movie.With the 90s now retreating further and further into the past (sadly) how does Tomorrow Never Dies fare 20 years on? Quite well, in fact it might have gotten better with age. Set in April 1997 the story sees power-mad media mogul Elliot Carver (a less scary Rupert Murdoch) trick the UK and China into war with each other so he can manipulate politics and ratings in his favor via his massively corrupt news network.This is pretty much happening every single day with the various alphabet soup media outlets currently attempting to poison our minds.Two decades ahead of everyone else, Bond knows that something isn't quite right about this and infiltrates Carver's organization, seducing his wife Terri Hatcher) who happens to be an old flame, and making dozens of narrow escapes from zillions of henchman who come after him. The plot development is nothing special, the story is told in a rather flat, matter-of-ffact way with no real mystery or twists but it is very fast moving with some amazing action scenes.The making of the movie was apparently turbulent and chaotic though the final result is a solid action movie that happens to feature James Bond. David Arnold takes over scoring duties from Eric Serra, and is a massive improvement. Arnold understands spy music and his work here is top of the game. Some of the technology on display is a little dated now but TND actually feels a bit more political and contemporary that the last two of Daniel Craig's efforts.Brosnan never really turned in a bad Bond movie, though this one is his best.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Tomorrow Never Dies is a fast paced affair, and an easily agreeable time-waster, but it's not the follow-up Goldeneye deserved, either. It's much too daft for the heavy plot that it has. The main reason this movie is entertaining is the spectacular stunts. It has some great action set pieces, which managed to make the time pass nicely. Michelle Yeoh makes for a refreshingly unique Bond Girl, due to her actual Martial Arts background. I dug the chemistry with her & Brosnan. Speaking of Brosnan He is very good as Bond. He has charisma and wit to spare. He's not quite as good as Timothy Dalton, but he is excellent nonetheless. Johnathan Pryce is decent as the villain. He is fitfully menacing and did the job overall.

47,ironhorse_iv,This James Bond motion picture is a 007 out of 10. It was entertaining enough to watch even with its many flaws.,7,19 December 2019,"This action spy movie directed by Roger Spottiswoode originally had the title of 'Tomorrow Never Lies'. It was call that in order to represent the megalomaniacal Rupert Murdoch, William Randolph Hearst & Robert Maxwell like media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) quest to make tomorrow news come true by any means; even if it cause a world war between the United Kingdom and China. However a fax typo changed it forever and MGM found the error so attractive that they insisted on using it, although that it make little sense. Don't get me wrong, it sounds cool, but the title is very confusing. I never really got what it was supposed to mean. The only idea I can get is that the filmmakers wanted the new title to represent ego death, much in the same way the LSD heavy Beatles' song ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" did. This is why the film try to make James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)'s constant attempts to atone for the women whose lives he failed to save as a strong personal manifest to keep others alive. Yet that subplot involving ex-girlfriend Paris Carver (Teri Hatcher) lack any establish backstory. We're never really show any of their lovely dovely past through flashback. Nor does the dialogue give them much comedic charm with one another. If anything, it's seem like the duo really hate each other with their lack of on screen chemistry. It doesn't help that Brosnan and Hatcher feuded briefly during filming due to her arriving late due to pregnancy. You can tell that Brosnan didn't have fun talking to her. It also sucks that Teri played her so artificial and plain to the point that they cut her screen time after test audience's negative reactions toward how boring the character was. Honestly, the movie could work better if Monica Bellucci was case in that role or better yet Izabella Scorupco reprised her role as Natalya Simonova from 1995 Bond film 'Goldeneye'. That relationship was well established. Nevertheless I did dig Michelle Yeoh's role as Colonel Wai Lin, a skilled Chinese spy and Bond's ally. Bond and Lin did had some charm whenever they put together. Yet I found the whole them falling in love with each other in the third act, a bit unrealistic and rushed. I really don't think they should had made her into a clichés Bond girl that need to be rescue. She was pretty capable by herself with her martial arts skills. To add on that, I like Yeoh did all her own stunts. To tell you the truth, most of the movie action pieces were pretty awesome even if they were a bit over the top & a little impractical. The motorcycle escape while being pursued by a helicopter was very well choreographed and intense. The whole parking garage ambush & the opening weapon bazaar scene was also a lot of fun to see. If anything the climax was the only thing that was a bit lackluster as it fell into standard overdone recycle ending of an terrorist group trying to start a war between two powerful countries by nuking one of them; often seen before like in the 1967 film 'You Only Live Twice'. Plus it made Elliot Carver seem even hammier. Don't get me wrong, Pryce is great actor and he was mostly fine during most of the movie. I just found the last scenes with him to be just awkward. However original choice Anthony Hopkin would be killer in the role. It could had been awesome. As for the sociopathic henchmen Herr Stamper (Gotz Otto). I agree with critics and say that he was indeed a disappointing over the top one dimensional cartoony version of a 'Red Grant' rip off from 1963 'From Russia with Love'. In truth, I would rather have more scenes with Vincent Schiavelli as Dr. Kaufmann. At least he seem realistic whenever he takes great pleasure in shooting people. As for techno terrorist Henry Gupta played by magician Ricky Jay. I kinda glad they kept him as the tech guy as the whole throwing playing cards as weapons felt a little too 1960s gimmicky for the modern era of Bond films. Regardless it still kinda suck that this movie came out in the 1990s before the internet became a thing because to tell you the truth, it could had really work in today's society where misinformation from news outlets and social media is ever so presence especially when it comes to relationship with China. They could even reused the original plot for this movie where terrorists were trying to stop Hong Kong's turnover from British to Chinese control; which later became the bases of author Raymond Benson's 007 novel 'Zero Minus Ten' and update it to match the current crisis over there with the Water Revolution. Still it was a miracle that this movie was even made. After all, this 18th Bond film and second starring Brosnan had a troublesome production where filming started with no finished script nor key supporting characters cast. Even the music was somewhat of a mess as there were around twelve submissions with Sheryl Crow winning out in the end. Nevertheless I found composer David Arnold's composition ""Surrender"" performed by K.D Lang to be the best. This movie is also famous as the first film in its cinematic history to be entirely financed by advertisement endorsements from its sponsors. It really had way too much excessive product placement. Regardless it was also the first film to have nothing to do author Ian Fleming's work or life and the only one not to open as number one at the box office as it was going against James Cameron's masterpiece 'Titanic'. Even its clunky video game didn't have the same success as 'Goldeneye' did. Overall: While the movie is not as good as the first Brosnan's era Bond film.

49,The-Sarkologist,James Bond just does not seem to be the same,4,21 December 2013,"I thought that the title of a movie would tell us something about the movie itself, like Terminator II tells us that the movie is a sequel and is about a terminator. What does Tomorrow Never Dies tell us? Possibly that it is about the future and, well, I don't know actually. All I know is that it is a James Bond movie and as I watched the movie, the title didn't seem to say anything at all.Okay, this is a James Bond movie so it is going to sell on that alone. Does it follow along with the tradition of the typical James Bond movies? James has more than one girlfriend during the movie; the bad guy is internationally powerful and uses advanced, almost science-fiction technology to fulfil his plans; the title screen has silhouettes of naked women dancing around, well it seems to be; and there are the typical Q-gadgets. Fair enough, this is still in the style of the original Bond. So this should appeal to a typical James Bond fan like myself, but it didn't.Pierce Brosnan plays James Bond in this movie, and he is not bad; much better than was Timothy Dalton, but he still does not shine like Sean Connery and Roger Moore. Sean Connery is James Bond, nobody can really take his place. Roger Moore did, and he did a good job at it, but in my opinion the era of James Bond has come to an end. I was told that Ian Flemming wrote thirty Bond stories in the fifties and that this was one of them. That is possible, but with all of the modern technology used, if it was then there was much adaptation done to it, especially the scene in Saigon.There was one particularly good scene in this movie, and that was the chase through the streets of Saigon. Actually, the chase went from the streets to the rooftops, and even to the balconies. What I liked about this was the layers of the city, the roof tops of the city were almost another layer to the city itself and so were the balconies that ran along the sides of the buildings. This was very much unlike the Western cities were we just move along the streets; this city had many layers in which one could travel along.As for this movie, well it is quite dry. I did not really enjoy it that much. I think James Bond is coming to the end of his life and we are watching his death throes. Bond has never been the same since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even more so, it is degenerating into an action movie, which Bond is not. James Bond is a spy movie, which means that there is action, but not too much. This one has Bond running around with machine guns killing heaps of people. Somehow this is just not how I envisioned Bond.",Tomorrow Never Dies

51,slightlymad22,Seems To Be A Bit Forgotten,7,25 March 2020,"I really enjoy this one, from its pre title sequence Tomorrow Never Dies is superior to Goldeneye in many respects. It continue to approach which proved so popular with the previous film: a modern, high-tech look in the 1990s combined with the traditional elements of the earlier classics including large larger than life girls, gadget and villains. The film looks expensive and every penny was up there on the screen.There are some wonderful and memorable elements in tomorrow dies, among them an outstanding cast. Even the supporting characters are played by a diverse group of highly talented actors. Pierce Brosnan is even more impressive this time round and seems far more comfortable in the role of 007. The movie beautiful beautifully photograph by Robert Elswit, with one scene standing up in particularly: Bond is sitting in a chair is his hotel room awaiting the arrival of an unknown assassin. The image of Brosnan, clad in a white shirt and shoulder holster. It seems intentionally to recall the the sequence in Dr.No in which Bond awaits the arrival of Professor Dent. It is little touches like these which make Tomorrow Never Dies a 007 fans delight.Whilst there is a real spectacle which has been lacking from the last several Bond movies Tomorrow Never Dies is not without a few errors. It's main plot playing one country off the other has been used twice before (in YOLT and TSWLM) and when Bond goes to Vietnam, the movie goes full action movie mode, The Motorbike chase is spectacular as is the climatic finale but both ran a bit too long for me. Nevertheless Tomorrow Never Dies is a classy, exotic entry in the series and can proudly rank as one of the best Bond films.I love Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin, she is a great Bond girl who kicks ass, Teri Hatcher looks great as Paris Carver but there is a serious lack of chemistry between her and Brosnan. It's no secret I love Jonathan Pryce, so I think Elliot Carver is great. I love him teasing Lin ""pathetic"". Judi Dench really comes into her own in this movie as M, telling Bond to ""pump"" Paris Carver for information, whilst I always love to see Desmond Llewelyn.Oh I forgot to mention this is only the third time we see Bond in full dress uniform as a Royal Navy commander. The other too being You Only Live Twice and The Spy Who Loved Me.Tomorrow Never Dies opened the same day as James Cameron's Titanic. Bond had the weekend first and when Titanic movie from its summer release date, Bond didn't flinch. Even with THAT competition it still grossed $124 million at the domestic box office.",Tomorrow Never Dies

53,Rodrigo_Amaro,One of the most exciting Bond films ever made,10,1 August 2013,"By far, my favorite of Brosnan along with ""Goldeneye"". Might not be one of the best Bond movies but it's certainly one of the most memorable. But truth be told: its effectiveness now is a little ruined to the massive appeal of the award winning ""Skyfall"", which at the same time reinvented Bond yet brought back some of its most appreciable qualities - this merge was inexistent in ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace"", both are just new reboots with a theme song to show that it's faithful to its roots. Mr. Brosnan at the top of his game, so smooth, active and funny, returns as Bond with plenty of style in one of Bond's most down to earth missions: to stop a possible conflict between England and China about to emerge from the dephts of a creative and destructive mind, the egocentric Elliot Carver (the priceless Jonathan Pryce), a media mogul à la Citizen Kane/Rupert Murdoch with his own declaration of principals which is to provide the news before they happen. The big scoop is to broadcast (and cause!) the WWIII. 007 is helped by a Chinese agent, the handy Colonel Wai-Lin (Michelle Yeoh) who is more advanced in her spy/fight techniques; and the other Bond girl is a former affair of his, now married with Elliot, a femme fatale played by Teri Hatcher. And this wouldn't be a complete Bond movie without the gadgets carefully supplied by Q (Desmond Llewelyn); here, a fully equipped BMW car that can be guided with the cellphone which also has its deadly functions. It's quite obvious the merchant made by the already mention company - they also brought a fancy motorcycle used in one of the most thrilling sequences when James and Wai-Lin escape from Carver's henchmen and that includes the couple's fly over a helicopter. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is great because it doesn't commit any kind of excesses, the plot is very simple to follow (this can be viewed as a problem to some, specially those who are more accustomed with complex plots, Bourne style) and never absurd; all the action and adventure are not overplayed, prolonged or tiring, it's all in a good measure and it's very exciting. I dare say those sequences were quite inspired. High point: the building escape using Carver's poster as a way out; the incredible car chase; Wai-Lin effortless escape tactics against the dangerous ones faced by 007, who feel a little annoyed with her. Their pairing is one of the best in the series, but the great and fun spectacle is the buffoon Carver and his memorable lines and actions (his mimics of Wai-Lin fighting style kills me every time). Obviously, he cannot put up a fight against the secret agent, but he has the loyal and muscular Stamper (Götz Otto), a frightening guy who likes to torture his victims, and that's his only form of pleasure.For me, the only downer of this movie was the theme song, that hurts the ears, completely oversung. Anyway, it's a fun entertainment, filled with adrenaline and we can't forget the marvelous cast (one of the finest in the series) with Judi Dench (M), Samantha Bond (Moneypenny), Geoffrey Palmer, Vincent Schiavelli, Ricky Jay, Joe Don Baker and Gerard Butler (but you get an award if you find him in the middle of all the action). 10/10",Tomorrow Never Dies

55,zkonedog,Just Your Average Bond,5,3 March 2017,"After the incredible success of ""Goldeneye"" in Pierce Brosnan's first Bond outing, he returns here with a much more average campaign.For a basic plot summary, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" sees Bond (Brosnan) trying to corral news mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) from setting up a network of satellites that will give him complete control over world news. Along the way, Bond meets up with former flame Paris (Terri Hatcher) as well as new ""partner in spy"" Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh).Simply put, as the title of this review indicates, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is little more or less than the average Bond film. On the bright side, all the typical ""Bond elements"" are in place and in the right spots. On the downside, it takes a long time for this movie to shift from ""exposition mode"" to full-on ""Bond-dom"". Plus, the villains are completely dry (Carver is ridiculous) and even the henchmen are more cardboard than usual.Ironically enough, if one could combine the first half of Brosnan's later ""The World Is Not Enough"" with the second half of this effort, we would have maybe the best Bond ever! As it stands, though, this is probably Brosnan's 3rd-best effort, ahead of ""Die Another Day"" but behind the others.",Tomorrow Never Dies
56,johnnyboyz,"Falling well short of its predecessor, Tomorrow Never Dies sputters into life for a while but fizzles out by the end.",6,22 July 2020,"Some of the very worst of what can characterise the James Bond franchise saturates ""Tomorrow Never Dies"": the lazy bricolage; the product placement; annoying political correctness; the emphasis on action and not espionage or mystery, while much of what is supposed to be synonymous with it is often nowhere to be seen: the localities are often drab or urbane; the cars are unexciting; the women too hard bodied. It has a polished, digitalised sheen to it - laser shows and glass skyscrapers dot the experience and there is all but a total absence of plot.In essence, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is a loose remake of ""You Only Live Twice"" with bits of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" thrown in for good measure - there is the billionaire who seems to mean well; the rising threat of a war between two superpowers and the presence of a female spy from the other side helping out. There is a lot of 'movie' action, whereby second unit material transpires without actual attention to anything, so cars needlessly smash into shop-fronts when there might have been a patron inside; motorcycles come down through residential ceilings, but conveniently avoid crushing people. I read the film was rushed and had its problems during production. It shows.All said, it is easy to remain on side with the film for its first third, despite its missteps; the opening, goofier than ""Goldeneye"", sets the pace in depicting a race against time as Bond (Pierce Brosnan) attempts to fly some nuclear weaponry out of an arms bazar before a British rocket wipes everyone out. Was there a need to escape so aggressively? Sure, set the odd explosion off to create a diversion, but what else? Getting out with the plane, a villain in the rear attempts to choke Bond to death, (unwise if you didn't want to crash), as a pursuing jet tries to shoot them down anyway - a situation remedied by the most explosive ejector seat in history and the most penetrative helmet.Cut to a British warship in the South China Sea, which thinks it's in international waters, but is correctly informed by the Chinese air-force it isn't because, unbeknown to anyone, the ship's radar is being jammed by men working for media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), who's looking to capitalise on warfare for monetary purposes. Words are exchanged but nothing happens, so Carver's side sink the battleship from the confines of their undetectable vessel and shoot down a jet. Both sides blame the other. Carver, however, makes two mistakes: his interference of the radar is carried out from his Hamburg base and then, more stupidly, he publishes the story in his newspapers before anyone could realistically have known anything.This is the cue for, less-so an espionage-driven mystery like ""Goldeneye"", where contacts are met; investigations made and a puzzle comes together because we know exactly where we stand, but instead for an exercise in second unit material as the already flimsy plot from the forty minute mark comes apart at the seams. Some of the stuff in Hamburg, Bond's first point of investigation, works quite well - the idea of an ex-partner, now the wife of the villain himself, is an interesting idea and there are some good scenes between Bond and Teri Hatcher's character. Milling around is Michelle Yeoh's Chinese agent Wai Lin, who is not given formal introductions and acts more as this spectre looming around doing her own investigations, which I found quite effective. When she first meets Carver, he asks her informally to call him Elliott, despite being married, and so foreshadowing the demise in the relationship with his wife.Alas, beyond the discovery of the encoder device used to jam the satellites of the ship in the opening, there is very little to get excited about. We are aware of there being a mere forty-eight hours to war between the British and the Chinese, but the film mysteriously lacks tension as the clock ticks down; all of the pieces have been moved into position too early on, and there is nothing left to do but watch the game play out. The idea of a media baron, someone capable of bringing down (or putting in) governments, and implanting views into people's minds via television and magazine content, views they would not normally possess, is, however, still as striking now as it was in 1997. Carver, physically weaker than Trevelyan before, stands as a sort of Lex Luthor to Brosnan's Superman - his stature effectively put across via large mug-shots; tall, dominating glass buildings and quick-witted headline-style putdowns.But the film is, ultimately, a dud; possessing too many hallmarks of a bad blockbuster - in the end, the set burns because, what else? A character by the name of General Chang plays a pretty important role in the overall scheme of things, but is never even introduced and, so far as I can tell, escapes. Wai Lin and Bond's coming together is efficient enough, but executed too hastily, and let's not look past the fact Yeoh was present to sell tickets in the Far East. All this in mind, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is a difficult entry to get excited about.",Tomorrow Never Dies
57,filipemanuelneto,"A good movie, but far from excellence",5,2 April 2016,"Directed by Roger Spottiswoode and produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, has Bruce Feirstein script and is the eighteenth film in the franchise. In this film, Pierce Brosnan plays 007 alongside Michelle Yeoh, in the role of Bond-girl Wai Lin, Teri Hatcher, on the role of Paris Carver and Jonathan Pryce, in the role of Elliot Carver. In this film, James Bond will investigate a mysterious act of war between Britain and China, allying to an agent of the Chinese secret services. Quickly, the two spies will focus their attention on a mysterious and egocentric mogul media, which doesn't look at ways to keep himself at the top of the audience.This is the second movie where Pierce Brosnan gives life to Bond and, as in the first appearance, he failed to surprise the audience. The actor is good and strives but failed to give authenticity to his Bond, even in action scenes, and convincing the public. Not to mention that, increasingly, advertising products will invade the film as if it were a plague. The plot, however, will help getting to forget such problems. In fact, the way the mass media influences the world thinking is still a concern for many people, particularly the anti-mainstream groups. Still, it's sad to see that, as happened with the previous film, this movie also has not sought a drop of inspiration in the novels of Ian Fleming. Another very positive point of this film is the excellent interpretation of Jonathan Pryce, in the villain's role. He managed to become truly relentless. The curious Q-branch gadgets back to deserve a positive note thanks to a BMW, which not only walks alone but also has a female voice. The opening theme of this film, sung by Sheryl Crow is, in my opinion, striking and worthy of being heard and appreciated.",Tomorrow Never Dies
58,TheMovieDiorama,Tomorrow Never Dies had the misfortune of being released after 'GoldenEye'.,6,22 January 2019,"""The distance between insanity and genius, is measured only by success"". It seems the most memorable and intuitive lines of dialogue that have stuck with me all these years, come from Bond films (who knew!). I feel as if Tomorrow Never Dies is under appreciated. It had the unfortunate timing of being released after the unanimously acclaimed 'GoldenEye'. And in hindsight, after watching many many films and growing as an amateur reviewer, this entry is bland. So utterly formulaic that you yourself could start guessing the headlines that the megalomaniac media mogul ""creatively"" writes. Speaking of hammed performances, Pryce was so over-the-top that I was patiently waiting for a maniacal laugh. To my disappointment, we never get one. We do however get a short reenactment of 'The Karate Kid'. The dialogue is clunky for the most part and everything is over explained, with Charles describing the GPS system to M (apparently, everyone is dumb). Action scenes had far too many jump cuts and the chemistry between Bond and Wai-Lin was one-dimensional. But what's this? News just in! ""Tomorrow Never Dies isn't all that bad!"". The plot revolving around media manipulation is one that feels more apt than ever and, whilst formulaic, is consistently captivating. Wai-Lin is a complete badass thanks to Yeoh's performance and should've got her own spin-off (which apparently was in the works). The quippy one-liners are as effective as ever and Brosnan still exhumes suaveness. Oh, and the BMW car chase (despite how stupid it is) is damn good fun.

63,Anonymous_Maxine,"Good action, good acting, idiotic one-liners, a bonehead story, and James Bond at his most reckless.",6,9 August 2001,"(spoilers) The traditional opening sequence of Tomorrow Never Dies is excellent. Especially when compared to the horrendous opening of the awful film that followed this one, The World Is Not Enough. When we see James Bond steal the bombs from the Nuclear Arms Bazaar in Russia, overcoming every obstacle (including an overdone gunfight), we expect an awesome film to follow, but to a large extent we are disappointed. I'm willing to accept the suggestion that a fighter jet could be piloted, at least temporarily, with the knees, if the pilots hands are busy trying to prevent the co-pilot from strangling him. I actually liked that scene, but for him to also be able to fly right underneath another jet (I won't even go into the fact that the pilot of the other jet didn't seem to notice this) and eject the co-pilot into the co-pilot seat of the other jet, thus blowing it up, is just too far. Still, the opening scene, ending with Bond victoriously asking where the recovered bombs should be delivered, leaves the audience with a smile and the hopes of a quality action film to follow.The story involves a high-powered media mogul who intends to instigate World War III in order to boost his ratings and make him ridiculously rich. Although, from the looks of his office,' he already IS ridiculously rich. No, this isn't original at all, but at least the scriptwriters were courteous enough to put the quote that they stole and made a movie out of right into the dialogue (William Randolph Hearst once said, `You provide the pictures, I'll provide the war.'). There you have the entire plot of the film. The famous quote `Good news is no news' is another stolen item that can be found in Tomorrow Never Dies, thinly disguised in the clichéd line, `There's no news like bad news.' As Bond first takes on his mission impossible, there is a good scene where he introduces himself as a banker to Mr. and Mrs. Elliott Carver (the offending media mogul and one of Bond's own past lovers, respectively), but he revealed himself far too soon when he not so subtly make a comment about Carver's crimes. Sure, they have to get the movie going, but if he hadn't been so ham-handed in that scene, he might not have wound up in that sound proof room. Speaking of which, Elliott Carver, the media mogul, makes an extremely unimaginative villain for this 007 installation, and although he seems effective enough at first, he soon reduces himself to an annoying character who badly misuses his own power, leading to his own violent death in the spinning wheels of the horrendous exaggeration that was one of the tools he used to instigate his artificial war.Probably the best part of this whole movie is the unintentional comic relief. As I watched Tomorrow Never Dies, I found that I burst out laughing more often than I found myself on the edge of my seat. When Bond parks his car in the parking structure, after having stolen the decoder device, a bunch of bad guys arrive, tow truck and all, to break into the car and retrieve the decoder. It was funny enough when one of them tried the door handle, only to be given an electric shock, but when another one of them tried the other side, with the same result, I found myself in hysterics! And then, just to make sure that Tomorrow Never Dies is not confused with an action movie that is to be taken seriously, a THIRD guy tries the door, receiving the obvious electric shock, after sledge hammers and machine guns had failed to provide entrance to the car. Which is weird, because the windows were shot out readily enough in the car chase that soon followed which was, by the way, the best action sequence in the entire movie. This is more of an action comedy than anything that Jackie Chan or Chris Tucker have ever done.The murders that James Bond commits in Tomorrow Never Dies are also fairly uncharacteristic. While they were stealing quotes to form the foundation of this film, one of the writers should have added in Arnold Schwarzenegger's line from True Lies, `Yeah, but they were all bad.' Bond drops a guy into the spinning gears at a Carver newspaper press, with bloody results (and the obligatory cheesy one liner  `They'll print anything these days.'), he shoots a guy in the face at point blank range, and he moronically endangers the lives of innocent people as he drives his car, remote controlled, of course, through the wall on the roof of a parking structure, raining large chunks of asphalt and a huge chunk of BMW down on the sidewalk below.
The scenes that were more or less done right were very rare but it was good to see some miniscule bit of realism allowed into this otherwise extremely unrealistic movie. The car chase scene where Bond drives from the backseat was hideously exaggerated but it was also effective. The skydiving wasn't completely screwed up like it was in movies like Drop Zone and Moonraker, but it was still badly flawed. There needs to be a little more thought put into these movies, because even if James Bond is enough of a badass to ride a motorcycle (BMW, of course, this IS a 2 hour commercial, after all) like it had wings, no helicopter in the world can fly nearly inverted like the one near the end of the film did. But this is just the kind of nonsense that is commonplace in 007 movies, and after Tomorrow Never Dies, the James Bond creators manage once again to slap world audiences in the face and the wallet with another idiotic action epic, The World Is Not Enough, which comes off even worse than this installment.",Tomorrow Never Dies
64,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,3 November 2020,"There is some hate on this one, but, honestly, it's one of my favorites and certainly my favorite Brosnan 007.We get a lackluster opening (as far as 007 openings go) but that is followed by a theme song by Crow who, well, she nailed it didn't she? Tomorrow Never Dies sounded like the jazzy intro to a Connery Era 007 didn't it? It was probably the best Bond song since The Spy Who Loved Me.Brosnan is a little more cold blooded in this, you catch glimpses of 007 being Connery/Dalton/Flemming Era 007 again. He doesn't shy away from executions with a cunning quip.But, honestly, it's Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin that really puts it over-the-top and makes it the best of the Dalton Era 007's. He has met his match with this Chinese counterpart who, and he has certainly done it before, but this time she comes across as clearly being as good as Bond himself. And that was a delight.And then the plot, media manipulation, probably far more relevant in 2020 than it was in 1997, but watching it now rings true as completely believable ala Spanish American War this has happened before, but this time it could go nuclear sort of story.All in all, it is one of the best 007 films ever made.",Tomorrow Never Dies

The magic and the charm has disappeared and Bond movie is now at the same level as the Discovery channel with endless digital equipment, and technical details and if you take them away, it's just another spy movie.

67,drqshadow-reviews,"Rushed and Uncertain, Tomorrow Never Dies is a Bland, Faceless Entry",5,24 February 2020,"When war horns bellow between China and the UK, MI6 sends their resident super-spy to get to the bottom of the grievance. It doesn't take much detective work to discover the man most likely to profit from such international conflict: media mogul Elliot Carver, who just so happens to have launched a 24-hour news network in time to broadcast the opening volleys.It's a forward-thinking concept for the franchise, asking pertinent questions about the rooting interests of the press, but the whole affair is painted in rather broad strokes, every dilemma solved with the same rudimentary answer: shoot bullets until the problem goes away. Preferably in a big, round, satisfying fireball. Carver is a role that could have been really interesting, a menacing mash-up of Steve Jobs and Rupert Murdoch, and I would've loved to see Anthony Hopkins tackle it, as originally cast. Alas, his departure after a mere three days left the part to Jonathan Pryce, who really hams it up (even by Bond villain standards) and spoils the character's potential. Not that the thin, rushed script did him many favors. His henchmen are severely lacking, too, a rather pedestrian clan without much in the way of muscle or panache.So we've got James, plus special guest-star Michelle Yeoh (a highly stereotypical, but effective, shot of adrenaline), mowing through a crowd of red shirts en route to a lackluster final showdown with the scrawny, intellectual owner of a media empire. It's not without merit - the chase scenes are still quite good and there's a renewed emphasis on gadgets this time around - but in the pantheon of 007, I would consider Tomorrow Never Dies middling at best.",Tomorrow Never Dies
68,Fluke_Skywalker,Fake News,5,14 October 2020,"Re-watching the Bond films--in no particular order--in anticipation of the release of No Time to Die (should it ever actually happen), has been oftentimes more interesting than entertaining. Take the Brosnan films for example. No please, take them. Except Golden Eye. I kid. Sorta. Anyway, Brosnan got off to such a great start w/Goldeneye that it makes his tenure all the more tragic when you begin to realize that was it. A fleeting moment of greatness followed by a steady decline into absurdity.I've already revisited Goldeneye and his final film, Die Another Day, and they were the films I remembered them to be. One excellent, and one awful. Tomorrow Never Dies is neither, but that's almost its worst sin. Generic. Slight. Dull. These are a few words that come to mind when describing it. Though I will ultimately rank it higher, I'd probably rather re-watch the preposterous Die Another Day than this shrug-worthy second effort by Brosnan.There is potential here w/Jonathan Pryce's eye-archng media mogul villain and the butt kicking Michelle Yeoh along for the ride, but they're ultimately wasted thanks to a weak, cookie cutter script and boilerplate direction by the ""How did he get this gig?"" Roger Spottiswoode. No one here, not even Brosnan, seems to be trying very hard and the film suffers greatly from their collective lack of passion.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Elsewhere, how interesting it is to see a then-unknown Gerard Butler involved in a minor part.I'm not a huge fan of the plot in this eighteenth Bond production, mainly due to its predictability.

73,slokes,Lacks Punch,7,20 September 2004,"Is it a generational thing? Do Bond films get worse as one gets older? Is possible Pierce Brosnan can be so ill-suited as 007 not only in comparison with Sean Connery but plummy old Roger Moore? Do shoot-outs become less entertaining as one discovers the meaning of real violence? Do sex scenes become less titillating as one realizes the diminishing likelihood of ever getting in a clinch with the likes of Teri Hatcher or Michelle Yoeh?All questions aside, I liked ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" Not loved it, the way I did some truly lame Bond thrillers from the 1970s I grew up with like ""Diamonds Are Forever."" 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is a solid movie, with a creditable performance from Brosnan, nice assistance from Hatcher and Yoeh as two very different types of Bond girls, and a fun concept for a chief villain carried out with campy aplomb by Jonathan Pryce. I really liked Stamper, too, the hard-chinned Aryan muscle man played by Gotz Otto who treats knife wounds like mosquito bites.You also have some terrific moments, especially in the first half, which after a strong opening sequence where Bond breaks up a terrorist arms bazaar, the storyline shifts to Pryce as the unfair and unbalanced media mogul Elliot Carver, who is stirring up a war in the South China Sea in order to launch his new global news network with all the inside dope on the world's biggest story. It's not an accurate depiction of what Rupert Murdoch's about, but its funny satire, especially when Carver starts making for Ms. Yoeh.Two moments in the first half stand out. One is an exposition scene that Bond has with M inside a limo speeding through London. Bond and M throw back some whisky while sunlight casts intricate patterns through the car's interior. It's a stylish way to present what would normally be a dead scene, and the interplay between Bond and Judi Dench's M draws you in.The other scene is Bond's confrontation with evil Dr. Kaufman, played by the always quirky Vincent Schiavelli. Kaufman has the drop on Bond, but like everyone else in these movies, can't quite just shoot him without bragging first. The dialogue here is funnier than you expect, and well-served with just the right amount of menace and drama to keep the scene grounded. Some other goons tell Dr. Kaufman they are having problems breaking into Bond's car. ""Have you tried the auto club?"" demands Herr Doktor.But the movie takes a dip shortly after, as Bond plays around with his remote-control BMW in a high-rise garage. Technically, the scene works well enough, but Bond's motives are confusing and there are too many silly moments of convenience, like the way the car manages to cut a high-tension cable the bad guys string up.It is a good film after that, just not as good as before. Carver's big scheme seems a bit dopey the more you think about it (and the film gives you plenty of opportunity to do that.) There's a chase between a motorcycle and a helicopter that's a little too busy and untethered from the rest of the film. I like Brosnan's chemistry with Yoeh, but this is one time the final romantic clinch comes across as tacked on; they're more like partners than lovers. The way Carver's plot comes unglued at the end is entirely too easy.But for all that, I keep coming back to the moments I like. Desmond Llewelyn's final solo turn as Q. Brosnan's quippier moments, like when his BMW starts to talk to him in a stern female voice: ""I think we've met."" (Too bad Brosnan seemed to lose his sense of humor as Bond after this.) Most especially, I admire the score by David Arnold, thrown up amazingly well despite the lack of opportunity for post-production work. It's an exciting blend of old Bond themes reworked around fresh orchestration that updates the sound of 007 with clever familiarity.At times, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" succeeds in updating the look and feel of 007, too. But not enough. Like Carver might say, ""it lacks punch."" Maybe that's because while tomorrow never dies, time does pass and we all grow up. That's one thing you and I have over James Bond, for better or worse.",Tomorrow Never Dies
74,davidmvining,Brosnan trips up in his second outing,5,2 March 2020,"This is an odd one. I really like large parts of Brosnan's second Bond adventure, but I groaned through other large parts. It's a movie at war with itself, and it ultimately loses the fight. The iconography of the franchise is all there, but so much of it feels out of place, and the new stuff feels squeezed into the Bond box uncomfortably.Starting with the pre-credits sequence, the execution of it is quite adept, but it's...odd in concept. A terrorist weapons bazaar in the middle of a snowy noplace? Is that how things actually work? Whatever, the sequence is fun as Bond shoots and punches his way to a plane with a nuclear bomb and flies it away, fighting the copilot and another plane as he goes. It's tight and effective, if a bit loopy, feeling a bit more Roger Moore than Goldeneye felt.The action moves on to the South China Sea where a British destroyer has wandered into Chinese waters, convinced that they are seventy miles away from where they are, and getting into a standoff with some Chinese MiGs. In between is a stealth boat that's egging the confrontation on, destroys one of the planes, and sinks the destroyer with a drill missile from which they steal a cruise missile. This is the opening gambit to a rather ingenious plan to set two major powers against each other with the ultimate goal of getting exclusive broadcasting rights in China for Elliot Carver, the media mogul antagonist.That's not a typical Bond villain motive, but I like it in the aggregate. It's in the execution of how the movie presents the plan that I end up having problems with. There's a central character to this whole thing, General Chang, a Chinese military officer working with Carver to help make things happen with the ultimate goal of becoming the head of the Chinese government. He's in one scene, and he's barely in it. It's very weird that a central player in this conspiracy is hardly in the movie, talked about far more than he's actually in it.Instead, we get Carver. Now, I like Carver in concept, and Jonathan Price is kind of wonderful in the role, but the character is mostly a vehicle for exposition. He spends most of the movie explaining things, in particular his scheme. Despite the different plot and presence of a quality actor, Carver falls flat. His wife is the same.Paris Carver, played by Teri Hatcher, is one of those characters in these later Bond movies that talk about having a long history with Bond, but we've never seen them before. It's a weird thing to thrust on an audience when dealing with a character with such a long history as Bond. Couldn't they have named Paris Melina (the girl from For Your Eyes Only)? It wouldn't have improved the character or Hatcher's performance, but it would have provided us a franchise-based grounding with the character. Anyway, besides that weird callback to a past we've never seen, Paris is a dead end. The implied history doesn't get enough screentime, the two actors don't have enough chemistry, and the reunion is played too seriously. It's obvious that the movie wants us to feel some level of emotion when Bond and Paris hook up again. The performances tell us, the music tells us, the close ups tell us. But we'd just met the woman a few minutes before and they never really made a strong connection.Once she's gone, though, the movie (outside of Carver's endless explanations) picks up. The action in the movie in general is actually quite good. I really enjoy the chase through the parking garage with the remote control car. It even looks like Brosnan is having fun. But it's the introduction of Michelle Yeoh that makes the latter half of the movie pop.Michelle Yeoh is a legitimate action star in her own right. She can kick with the best of 'em, and her style of action acts as a nice contrast with Bond's which is more gun focused. She's working the same mystery from the Chinese side (in what needs to be one of the earliest forms of Hollywood treating the modern Chinese government with kid gloves in a major spectacle motion picture), and they team up. They actually do have a rapport, but it's not romantic. It's professional, and the movie largely lets it play that way. That's probably because the team up happens so late in the film and there's just so much plot to work through that there's no time for bedding, until the very end. I swear, if there was ever a Bond girl that shouldn't have kissed Bond, it was Michelle Yeoh. They don't have the relationship for it, but this is a Bond film that has the iconography but doesn't seem to quite understand it. Sometimes, you need to go against the grain. Just because there's a good looking woman it doesn't mean she needs to fall for Bond.So, yeah, it's a mixed bag of a film. The iconography is there, but it largely doesn't know what to do with it. The Bond girls are on opposite ends of the spectrum. The plot is clever, but poorly told. The action is rather universally good. It's a real let down from Goldeneye.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Clearly someone read an article on upon technology, and heard the phrase ""Information is the future"" and ran with it.I imagine this inspired the one cool thing about this movie: the remote control driving, literally back-seat driving, and today in 2020, this is legitimately possible.The ex lover / geo political nonsense is just noise at best, at worst it's a reminder that all these awful characters exist somewhere in the world, and the protagonist isn't any comfort either: a sociopath lying, stealing and killing his way through the world, normally these are crimes.",Tomorrow Never Dies

That was stupid.Jonathan Pryce was also a bit pathetic as a villain, though and I have to say the star of the show was really Michelle Yeoh.I also got a bit of wry amusement out of the stealth-boat. The producers obviously wanted something futuristic that looked stealthy. Naturally they chose a catamaran that exists in service today as a car ferry where I used to live. It does look the part and has a surprising turn of speed - 30+ knots.

Jonathan Pryce is mildly entertaining but over-the-top.  Teri Hatcher seems wasted here.  Michelle Yeoh is entertaining enough but seems to be emulating Woo's heroines. She's also curiously disassociated:  unlike in Spy Who Loved Me, we don't get any idea of the organization she belongs to, or that she's a Chinese agent, other than that she keeps saying she's a Chinese agent and she has a few gizmos.  We need a Chinese version of General Gogol to establish this, and it never comes.That leaves us with Brosnan himself.  Ugh.  Brosnan still seems to think he's doing light comedy (watch his pantomime reaction when he triggers the flame-throwing dragon in the bicycle shop) sans Remington Steele.  He can throw off bon mots well enough, but when it comes to dramatic emoting (his sullen drunkenness when Paris shows up, his discovery of her body), he just can't pull it off.  Even Roger Moore could pull off betrayal/despair/ vengeance better than this.  Brosnan's a decent action-type, but someone needs to tell him Bond is more than Remington Steele with guns and gadgets.The plot?  ""Pit one side against the other"" goes all the way back to From Russia With Love, and it's been revisited several times over the years (Diamonds, Spy Who Loved Me).

Terri Hatcher also stars as Bond's old flame, who happens to be married to the villain, a newspaper tycoon, and unfortunately there's a tragedy centred around her. In the tragic scenes, Brosnan really showed that he had the acting chops and could use it to good use. He's quite confident here, and has some flair and humour, but he can also show much detachment and coldness especially when he gives Dr Kaufman, a professor of forensic medicine as well as killing - who is confident that he can shoot Bond from Stuttgart und still create ze proper effect- a nice send-off.

81,pyrocitor,"""Filthy Habit""",7,29 November 2015,"Every decade, the world's least secret secret agent strives to reinvent himself to square off with the changing times. GoldenEye got the '90s ball rolling, boldly reasserting Bond's relevance and appeal in a more action-oriented, post-cold war setting, but it's Tomorrow Never Dies that charts his most topical, inevitable evolution: Bond as a video game character. But if the prospect of 007 swapping his Walther PPK in favour of dual-wielding submachine guns a-la first person shooter is enough to make you want to swig enough martinis to take you back to the '60s, take heart: this Bond may be a livelier, non-smoking, and more raucous edition, but he's still replete with more than enough charm, poise, and oddly topical sociopolitical satire to make Tomorrow Never Dies a somewhat puzzlingly rocky but reliably fun 007 escapade.With video game tie-ins on the brain, it's rather appropriate that Tomorrow Never Dies targets mass media broadcasting by way of central conceit (the opening credits, accompanied by Sheryl Crowe's silky, albeit forgettable, title ballad, drives the critique home, transforming Bond's customary slinking women into cybernetic nightmares). It's an unexpected reconciliation to have one of the most trigger-happy Bond films play as a strangely appropriate companion piece to Wag the Dog of all things, but the premise of machinating a world war for news coverage strikes the perfect balance between ludicrous and credible to play as far less fantastic, and far more ominously prophetic, than was likely initially intended. This paradoxical inconsistency proves pervasive, though. In contrast to the razor-sharp satire at its core, the film's script eschews all of GoldenEye's slick deftness in favour of a campier, flamboyant levity more befitting the Roger Moore era. This is no fault of Brosnan's, who glides across screen with a suave nonchalance. He aces Bond's more cold-blooded moments while still committing to some of the more groan- worthy one-liners of the post-Roger era (""we seem to have developed a certain attachment""), while grounding the more bombastic shootouts by never skimping on the chance to straighten his tie after a kill shot. It's his least showy rendition of the role, but his consummate smoothness is a perfect fit for the breezier tone of the film. Regardless, this can take some acclimatizing to, particularly thanks to nemesis Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce, delivering a deliciously hammy Rupert Murdoch caricature), who pontificates enough to make Auric Goldfinger roll his eyes. Nonetheless, in the wake of the grimmer, more personal Bonds to follow, it's hard to begrudge Pryce for taking so much evident joy in chomping through his monstrous monologues (his self-satisfied giddiness when proclaiming ""we're on a STEALTH BOAT"" is palpably infectious), and thereby reminding the film around him to share in the fun.But don't be distressed: director Roger Spottiswoode is more than happy to compensate for the film's talkier political subterfuge with enough explosions to retain the interest of all the mass media drones Carver salaciously preys on. For the purists, Spottiswood sprinkles in some vintage 007 globetrotting stuntwork (a halo jump skydive turned scuba dive; a breathtaking motorcycle/helicopter chase through the streets of Vietnam) amidst the more contemporary shoot-'em-ups. Bond even gets in on the video gaming fun, with Brosnan visibly cackling with meta glee as he drags his finger across a cell phone track pad, orchestrating his own car chase remotely from the back seat of his car. It's a thrilling sequence that toes the line of being too audacious even for Bond, but is curiously restricted to the confines of an interior parking lot – a setting almost as underwhelming as Bond's boxy new BMW, comedic relief German GPS and all. Grow up, 007. Thankfully, sh*t hits the fan with the introduction of Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin (literally, in the case of her Chinese Q-branch gadgetry, yielding the film's best pun) – arguably the first 'Bond girl' to be such a match for Bond that, rather than being subject to his customary sexist condescension, he almost pleads for her partnership. Yeoh is easily the most fun addition to the film, spicing up action sequences with her martial arts prowess, and balancing it with a perfectly acidic dry wit and oddly chipper approach to conflict resolution. She and Brosnan share a wonderfully curt but sparkling chemistry, trading barbs while shooting over each other's shoulders, that the franchise has never quite replicated since. By way of supporting cast, Teri Hatcher introduces the intriguingly dark subtext of infidelity into Bond's womanizing, even if Hatcher's affections may be a bit too glib to properly embody her character's world-weary heartbreak. Again mirroring the Moore days, Götz Otto, Ricky Jay, and the wonderful Vincent Schiavelli have fun as a pantheon of goofy yet sinister henchmen. Finally, Judi Dench's frosty M maintains an exquisite twinkle in her eye throughout, whether airly prompting Bond to ""pump Carver's wife (for information)"" or derisively barking at her As Time Goes By co-star Geoffrey Palmer, here fretting as an oafish Naval commander, while Desmond Llewellyn's Q saves a superfluous ""insurance waiver"" aside (""will you need collision coverage?"") thanks to his peerless cantankerous charisma.Imbalanced oddity that it is, Tomorrow Never Dies clips along at a tidy pace (one of the few Bond films not to breach two hours) – a clumsy but energetically competent return to the frivolity of the Moore era. Bolstered by the clever timeliness of its conflict and the winning chemistry between Brosnan and Yeoh, Tomorrow Never Dies makes for lighter and more action-heavy Bond fare, but exemplifies the escapist charm of the series without drenching it in the CGI excesses to follow. As Bond would retort, there's nothing wrong with ""giving the people what they want.""-7/10",Tomorrow Never Dies

84,sarastro7,"More waste of celluloid, but with two redeeming features",6,19 January 2005,"I confess to not being a 007 fan at all; I think almost all the Bond movies are horribly bad, not to say stupid. Still, they have become a part of our shared cultural experience, not unlike Star Wars; whenever a new one comes out, it is an instant classic. If it's really bad, it will simply become famous for being really bad, but become famous all the same. Sigh.Anyway, the Bond movies do vary in quality. Connery's tend to be the best, of course, and personally I think the Brosnan ones are the worst yet. Most Bond movies are about a super-villain who wants to achieve world domination in some shape or form, and this concept is always taken to ridiculous and utterly unrealistic extremes (and so, of course, are the action scenes). Compared to your usual dime-a-dozen lower-budget action movie, Bond movies are not the slightest bit better. And so, because of their higher budget, they deserve even more criticism for being badly crafted than other bad action movies. However you look at it, it's clear that Bond movies are simply made to make money, always using silly stories with no real substance.And yet! Tomorrow Never Dies is a little bit different. For once it is not politically silent; it overtly warns us of the dangerous power that the great media conglomerates wield over our lives, and questions the wisdom of a near-monopolized media system. This is admirable, and raises this Bond movie to a slightly higher level than most of the others.The other good reason to see Tomorrow Never Dies is the presence of Asia's number one female action star, Michelle Yeoh. She is amazing, and has a large part here, being prominent in the entire last half of the movie, which is composed of watchable action, although it's drawn out somewhat, esp. at the end.Thus, while still a ways off from being a *good* movie, Tomorrow Never Dies is in fact one of the not-too-terrible Bond movies. It's still *pretty* terrible, though! My rating: 6 out of 10.",Tomorrow Never Dies
85,mentalcritic,"Sorry, guys, but this film sucked!",2,16 October 2000,"Generally speaking, a Bond film's theme song is reflective of the film's quality, and the only exception to this law that I can remember has been Live And Let Die. A great theme song by Paul McCartney is mismatched with Roger Moore, the worst Bond ever. On Her Majesty's Secret Service has one of the best themes ever, a powerful instrumental that sums up the film without any vocals being needed at all. GoldenEye has one of the best themes ever recorded, by a woman who was just born to sing a Bond theme. If my voice is anywhere near as powerful as Tina Turner's when I get to be that age, I'll be a happy man. The World Is Not Enough even features a good song by an indie band, which is no small feat considering their usual pseudo-alternative drivel is only a step above (c)rap.Then there's Tomorrow Never Dies. I don't know who the hell decided that Sheryl Crow could sing a Bond theme song, but it is no surprise to me at all that she hasn't recorded a thing since Tomorrow Never Dies opened in 1997. It's as if she listened to her voice during the premiere and came to the shocking realisation that her vocals suck harder than a V-8 Powered Hoover. Adding insult to injury in this film is the closing number by K.D. Lang. Lang knows how to sing a song with class and style, even if her earlier work doesn't indicate this. Crow is clearly trying to give an operatic performance, and is way out of her depth, which isn't hard considering she has about as vocal much talent as my cat... oh, wait, my cat can actually hold a tune...Then there's the plot itself. Media mogul starts a war between China and the UK in order to sell more newspapers. Are they for real? Let's compare this with the plot for GoldenEye and The World Is Not Enough, shall we? GoldenEye features a mob of mad, ethnocentric Russian terrorists who steal an electromagnetic pulse weapon, with the intent of discharging it over England. The World Is Not Enough features an insane terrorist and an oil magnate's daugther who want to irradiate the world's oil supply for their own individual purposes. And then we have the media mogul who wants to start a war between two of the world's largest empires in order to sell more newspapers. Does that sound a bit lame by comparison, or is it just me?However, the worst part of this film is the villains. GoldenEye had a sex-mad helicopter pilot who derived pleasure from killing things, and a traitorous secret agent who is known personally to Bond. The World Is Not Enough featured a terrorist who, as implausible as he is, at least acted well enough to be menacing. Eliot Carver is, by comparison, a light warm-up. I could have walked in and torn his head off within the first five minutes of the film. Without Stamper as a bodyguard, he is quite literally nothing.Adding to these problems is the fact that the Australian release of this film appears to have been cut by the BBFC (at least on the DVD version), and a number of sequences fail to make any sense as a result. Sorry, gang, but this is the biggest dud in the Bond franchise since the entire Moore period. Maybe we could try an OHMSS-style film with Brosnan... heaven knows we need a film where Bond does more than exhibit the Rambo-syndrome. Eighteen films of it is more than enough.By the way, Denise Richards is one hell of an actress. She reminds me of an old girlfriend in every role she's played so far, which is an excellent quality by any standards. She was given one hell of a raw deal in comparison to Teri Hatcher, past Bond women like Carey Lowell, or future Bond women such as Halle Berry. At least Richards got past the overemphasised-voice-to-start-conversation school of acting. Seriously, what were they thinking in the Bond camp when they saw Hatcher's resumé? ""Let's get the most annoying non-actor to play the Bond girl and one of the most try-hard vocalists to do the theme song""? Sorry guys, but lowering Bond to the standards of the pop media just doesn't work. A pity they did not learn this before Advertise Another Day basically killed the series for good.",Tomorrow Never Dies
86,jeremycrimsonfox,"Good, If Not Memorable",7,1 February 2020,"After the HMS Devonshire is sunk by a stealth ship owned by Elliot Carver, a media baron who also has his henchman, Henry Gupta, destroy one of two Chinese MiGs flying around the ship while the ship's crew is slaughtered and a missile stolen, James Bond, who is resting after a mission to stop a terrorist arms bazaar near the Russian border, is called back to action to stop Elliot from sparking a war between the U,K. and China, as he is joined by Chinese agent Wai Lin, a Chinese spy who shares the same mission.So, this is the second movie with Pierce Brosnan, playing 007, and while it is not as memorable as GoldenEye, it's still good. Johnathan Pryce does a good job playing Elliot Carver, as his actions, which include creating news stories to cover up his crimes, is a good story. Also, it has some good action scenes (one has Bond and Lin escaping on a motorcycle, but with Bond holding one handlebar and Lin the other due to them being handcuffed together). This is a good Bond film by its own merit, and one I recommend giving a try.",Tomorrow Never Dies
87,Joxerlives,Interesting but not as good as Goldeneye,7,17 May 2014,"Interesting Bond film but not one of the classics although that might not be its' own fault. The good? Nice opening scene although for the record you cannot make a Harpoon missile such as the one HMS Devonshire fires to strike a land-based target. Bond gives up smoking in these PC times although at least he still drinks alcohol (maybe that's next? Maybe he'll eventually become a vegetarian too?). As well as the opening sequence the great scene with the remote control BMW really stands out and the motorcycle chase/HALO jump are genuinely exciting. Wade is back in good form, M is good as ever and nice to see Colin Salmon as the MI6 back room boy get some decent screen time (but no Tanner?). Also nice to see stage magician Ricky Jaye who will play a similar role on 'The Unit', one of my favourite TV series. The remarkable Vincent Schivelli too, making great capital from a small role and Geoffrey Palmer portraying an extremely realistic Admiral. We have a very contemporary villain, a Rupert Murdoch/Robert Maxwell/Ted Turner style media baron but one who decides it's easier to simply create the headlines rather than wait for them to happen. He wants world domination but not in the sense of traditional Bond villains, considering control of the airwaves to be of more value than traditional forms of dictatorship. We also have 007 dealing with the threat of an emergent China and nuclear weapon proliferation, the Russians now Britain's allies in the 'War on Terror'.The bad? No offence to Teri Hatcher, loved her in 'Lois and Clark' and 'Desperate Housewives' but she's terrible here. Her pregnancy cuts her role short and stop any real emotional development between the two. Pretty forgettable Bond girl (much like the other Oriental heroine in 'You Only Live Twice') and the plot is overall fairly undemanding.So good but not a patch on Goldeneye.",Tomorrow Never Dies
88,Beta_Gallinger,"There are worse films in the franchise, but this installment brought it downhill again after Brosnan's first",6,10 November 2008,"This is the second Bond film of four starring Pierce Brosnan, the fifth actor to play the role in the official movies. It's also the eighteenth installment in the franchise. Brosnan's first stint in the role, 1995's ""GoldenEye"" (the first of the 90's films in the franchise), perhaps turned out to be the best Bond film since the 1970's. However, after that film, this 1997 follow-up showed the franchise taking a couple steps down again. While ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is better than a number of its predecessors, especially Roger Moore's last couple ones, its lack of consistency makes it a little weak.Elliot Carver is a powerful, megalomaniac media baron whose broadcasting can reach the entire world, with the exception of China, where it is rejected by the country's current leaders. Determined to reach China so he can feed his ego, he plans to start a war between China and the United Kingdom, to put an end to the current regime in the eastern country! After a British battleship goes under in Chinese waters, evidence suggests that Carver was behind it, so James Bond is sent to investigate. On the mission, he meets a former lover of his, Paris Carver, who is now married to Elliot, and attempts to get information from her. Eventually, Bond meets Chinese agent Wai Lin, and together they must stop Elliot Carver from carrying out his evil plans, before it's too late! This eighteenth official Bond film has another action packed opening sequence. The opening sequence of this particular film makes it look promising, but after that, it seems to go downhill rather quickly, and doesn't pick up again until later (if it didn't pick up again at all, I couldn't rate it higher than 5/10). An example of a dull moment is the romantic scene between Bond and Paris Carver. Teri Hatcher doesn't put on a very good performance as Paris, and it's probably a good thing the character isn't in the movie for very long. There is some humour here and there, including a scene with Bond and Q (no surprise there), but that's not enough to make up for the lack of excitement. I found that the film finally picks up again when Bond and Wai Lin start fighting off enemies together (they make a good pair). I'm not sure why, since there is some action beforehand. After that started, I think I found the rest of the film pretty exciting, but this was a while into it.While some don't like Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, I think he was a fine choice for the role, but just because he can play the part doesn't mean this is a very good film. Sometimes in the franchise, a good film can come, but then the next one can turn out to be a significant drop from that one, and unfortunately, I think that's the case with this one coming after ""GoldenEye"". ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is certainly not the weakest Bond film, as I've already mentioned (it's not like Roger Moore's last couple ones, which I think I found to be almost frustratingly tiresome, good thing the franchise improved after those), but it's sadly inferior to quite a few Bond films that came before it. For some excitement and humour, I have to give this movie some credit, but you could find that there's not as much of those things as you would hope for.",Tomorrow Never Dies
89,vip_ebriega,More lesson in how to make a witty comic thriller with Mr. Bond.,8,8 May 2007,"My Take: It's briskly paced and entertaining that you dare not mind its flaws. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is just as good, if not better than,""Goldeneye"", and it was a much better effort than Pierce Brosnan's final role as Bond, ""Die Another Day"". The plot is simple. Media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) plots to create worldwide panic by creating real-life disasters and displaying them in his headlines. Bond is sent to stop him before he uses the world's forces against each other.The plot is very much the stuff TV serials involving megalomaniacs on prowl for world domination. But the film is very well done with style, that it's hard to disagree. Brosnan's performance is an exquisite combination of the suave and the tough. Pryce also delivers an top-notch performance as the maniacal Carver. As far as it goes, it has a great touch of realism, combined with a similar over-the-top, switch-your-mind-off action we have grown to love from the popular series.TOMORROW NEVER DIES is a suave, slick and entertaining comic thriller that returns to the sort of James Bond movie of THUNDERBALL and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the sort where the Bond matches brains and brawn with a megalomaniac who simply wants to take over the world. Don't expect much of a logical explanation. It's so busy and fast, there's no real time for that. But do expect some strong action, crisp dialog and, of course, Bond, James Bond! Rating: **** out of 5.",Tomorrow Never Dies
90,one9eighty,"""The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success""",7,22 September 2020,"Bond number 18 and Pierce Brosnan's 2nd outing comes in the form of 1997's ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". Running at just under 2hrs long this is a 12 rated film which is directed by Roger Spottiswoode with a screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein - of course, based on characters invented by Sir Ian Fleming. Made with a budget of $110 million this continues the successful trend of being a box office smash, grossing $333 million worldwide. This is the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, so Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are at it alone as producers this time around.Media baron Elliot Carver has obtained an encoder which allows cyber-terrorist Henry Gupta to provoke a war between China and the UK. The encoder can alter GPS information of a military vessel, and it is used to make it look like a British warship is somewhere it isn't intended to be. This allows Carver to devote a covert operation to getting some warheads for himself. As Carver is the first to cast media attention on the event, and he puts his own spin on it, MI6 suspects he knows more than he is initially letting on. Bond is sent to interrogate Carver, potentially by 'pumping' Carver's wife for info - who it turns out, is an old flame of Bond's. On his mission, Bond meets up with Wai Lin, who it turns out is a Chinese agent who is also investigating Carver. Their paths cross a few times as they try to uncover what involvement Carver has in the events. They realise before too long that Carver is manipulating events around the world in order to get scoops for his media empire. It's up to Bond and Wai Lin to stop Carver from creating tomorrows headlines today.Pierce Brosnan is great again as Bond, he brings in performance that is still reminiscent of the other actors who have played Bond before. He is lethal and direct like Connery, he is fun and flirty like Lazenby, he is whimsical like Moore, and his lethal like Dalton - a perfect combination and balance of all the previous incarnations of Bond.Bond's nemesis in this film is Jonathan Pryce as Elliot Carver. While his performance is good and authentic, he never really strikes me as a really threatening Bond villain. Perhaps it is his age and approach that did not sell it for me. Even as a genius mastermind I wasn't quite sold as he has people doing his bidding throughout the film - maybe he's a good planner, but as a nemesis, a mastermind, a threat - not quite, and definitely not an equal to Bond. Working for Carver, the main henchman, is Richard Stamper, played by Gotz Otto. Otto elicits all the characteristics of the ""Die Hard"" henchman Karl Vreski who works for Hans Gruber. In fact, Otto got twenty seconds to introduce himself to the cast when he was on-boarded, he did it in five seconds; ""I'm big, I'm bad, and I'm German.""Teri Hatcher got the role of Bond girl in this film. She might be gritty with attitude, especially the way she handles Bond, but it was a bit part that did not really require much skill. Her role is more of a throwback to when Bond girls just needed to be good looking rather than intrinsic to the plot of the film. It's for this reason she went on record years later to say that she got no satisfaction from the role, it was artificial without depth.While also labelled as a Bond girl, Michelle Yeoh as Colonel Wai Lin, I would argue is more of an equal to Bond and serves as much as a threat. Yes, she is a good-looking lady, but she is just as dangerous and deadly as the British spy. Yeoh's performance is good, I can believe that she is that dangerous - probably because she actually is. I read that Jackie Chan's own stunt team had to be called in to work with Yeoh because she is not used to holding back. She trained with them so rather than get people hurt it made sense to bring in a team that could handle her ferocity.Regulars in the franchise; M, Moneypenny and Q all return, respectively played by Judi Dench, Samantha Bond and Desmond Llewelyn. CIA agent Jack Wade, played by Ricky Jay, pops up and he is the same loudmouth American that he was in ""Goldeneye"".This outing was written from scratch because by the time the 90's rolled around, all of Sir Ian Fleming's novels had been used already. There are times it feels like some scenes were included just to sate audiences and what they expected to see in a 007 film. There were plenty of gadgets, like a remote-controlled BMW, an explosive watch, and a security cracking phone. There were of course the Bond girl's that I have already mentioned. There were death-defying stunts and sequences the defied logic at times - the helicopter using its rota blades springs to mind, or Bond and Wei Lin jumping off the side of a building and using a vinyl poster to escape. Bond gets his fair share of humorous remarks and quips too. While the key ingredients were there, importantly this film had a heart and it had a sense of realism in it too. The sense of realism is important, while films like ""Moonraker"" and ""A View to A kill"" are fun, they were a little far-fetched in certain elements and did not allow audiences to emphasise. In this, Carver's media empire is not unlike other worldwide media empires, Rupert Murdoch's springs to mind. How far are madmen willing to go to lead the way when it comes to having your finger on the pulse. Being firmly in the 90's before the full internet revolution the themes in this film were good and on-point. In retrospect, a lot of reviews have come back to this film and commented that perhaps it was ahead of it's time in regards to the concepts and ideas.
I enjoyed the film and think that it is a solid entry into the franchise. The cast and crew do a decent job and really bring a fun adventure to the table. It is complex enough to be engaging, but not too complex that it will baffle audiences. Definitely a family movie, I would have no problem putting any age group in front of the film. Just like my father watched the 60's and 70's Bond films with me as a child in the 80's, I can see this being one that father in the 2000's and beyond watch with their children too.In terms of Bond films this is a 8 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 7 out of 10.",Tomorrow Never Dies
91,rupie,"formulaic, but then so are the Haydn symphonies...",7,8 July 1999,"Sure the Bond movies are formulaic, but what a formula! ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" continues in the well-established James Bond tongue-in-cheek tradition of absurd heroics, over-the-edge technology, over-the-top action, villains you love to hate, women you'd love to love (sorry ladies; you're probably not interested in these 'guy flicks' anyway), explosions that are just short of nuclear, state-of-the-art chase scenes, exotic locales, world-threatening crises, ribald double-entendres, and self-lampooning dialogue that have made the 007 films of Albert R. Broccoli [R.I.P.] such an ongoing hit over the years.No one will ever replace Sean Connery in my book, but Pierce Brosnan is as worthy a successor as we're likely to get. 'Q' - he must be 120 by now - puts in his usual grumpy bit (""Oh, grow up Bond""). In this post-Cold War era it's always a challenge to come up with new villains and in this story it's - surprise! - international media conglomerates, with Jonathan Pryce as an obvious stand-in for Rupert Murdoch.

92,Stampsfightclub,An exciting and entertaining Bond thriller,8,29 October 2008,"James Bond (Brosnan) investigates a TV media man who is linked to a possible war brewing in the Chinese sea between the Chinese and British.Pierce Brosnan reprises his role as the famous British agent after a great start in the critically acclaimed Goldeneye. Expectation was high and Brosnan doesn't disappoint as once again he dons the suit and tie as James Bond in another classic action thriller, if not the strongest in the series.With a fantastic opening surrounding the criminals in the weapon market, Tomorrow Never Dies sets the tone for a high octane adventure and the hero enters, delivering another great opening line, punching a smoker and giving viewers that wonderful pun that only Bond can do.Unlike many Bond films, the villain is revealed almost instantly and the film centres around Bond trying to unravel the case and find out what media man Elliot Carver is up to.As good an actor as Jonathan Pryce is, there is hardly any doubt that his character Carver is one of the worst villains of all time. Unscary, too relaxed and easy to watch the Newspaper man does simply have that ruthlessness to create that essence of evil that has created so many good Bond villains in the past. Blofeld with his cat, Goldfinger with his laser and so on. Carver with his newspapers simply does not match up and the film falls short because of him.Teri Hatcher is very good as Bond's former lover but Michelle Yeoh is disappointing as Chinese agent Wai Lin. Yeoh's kicking action as the agent is good and fun to watch but the character does not contain that exciting and different prospect that other Bond girls have had and the ending feels almost completely clichéd because of it.Despite that faults in supporting characters the plot with it's terrific action sequences make for a gripping watch. From driving a car with a remote control to driving a motorbike over a helicopter, this film has created some astonishing and memorable moments in the action genre. The remote control car is an ultimate fantasy and is action packed adrenaline not to mention humorous at points as well.The plot is consistently intriguing with its issues on foreign pride and war, not to mention the different cultures between the Chinese and British government.Tomorrow never dies fills Bond fans dreams with top notch action sequences and an entertaining and issue driven plot.",Tomorrow Never Dies

97,ivo-cobra8,My seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie Pierce Brosnan second best movie,10,20 November 2017,"Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie and Pierce Brosnan second best movie he did in my opinion. It is not better than GoldenEye but it is good decent action movie with great explosions, dangerous stunts and great action. Who is my favorite James Bond 007? That will definitely be Pierce Brosnan no one else, since his first film GoldenEye. I saw this movie as a fifteen year old teen I even have a poster at home from this movie. I love this movie I thought Roger Spottiswoode did a good job directing it. I thought it had decent stunts, decent action, less humor than Roger Moore. If you agree with me good, if you disagree with me that is your opinion. Tomorrow Never Dies is the 18th entry in the official James Bond film series.Pierce Brosnan makes his second appearance as Agent 007, James Bond heads to stop a media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage. I love the opening scene in which in Russia Bond steals airplane with military missals and weapons who are been sold to international terrorist and brings them home. We see Pierce Brosnan flying an airplane. In real life Pierce Brosnan was scared of that airplane he thought the crew will killed him. You have a beautiful explosions from those airplanes. In Hamburg, Germany Bond breaks into the headquarters of Carver's media company and finds the office occupied by Henry Gupta, Carver's communications specialist and known techno-terrorist. He is been chased from security guys, because Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) makes entry and she touches the alarm. Bond is being fired by machine guns in which he flees great action sequences.Bond drives a new car BMW 7 Series with a remote control on a cell phone Ericson. I miss those times in which we used Ericsson cell phone. In 2004 I had that phone for a year until it got broken and I had to buy a new phone. Bond with cell phone drives with his cell phone as a remotely without touching the steering wheel. I did read a complaint about this scene on IMDb that is not realistic and it shouldn't have been in this movie. Listen folks it is a fiction not realistic, it James Bond so who cares. I never mind that scene it was great action sequence in which Bond eluded his attackers and he drove his car off the wall ha ha.James Bond and Wai Lin in Saigon, Vietnam jumped off the building in Carver's HQ. They escaped Carver's henchman and the flee off the building. They slide down Carver's poster while been handcuffed. Great action sequence in which Pierce Brosnan and Michele Yeoh drove handcuff on a motorcycle. That was incredible dangerous stunt. I read Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the motorcycle and it was really painful too sit on that bike her legs and body hurt her. Cars and helicopter chased them until they hanker the helicopter and it explodes. Practical effect real explosion no CGI or shaky cam real action. Bond in Vietnam that was interested story well done acted. Bond on the ship a stealth craft that is invisible on the radar uses hand grenade and he actives with his watch the grenade explodes and he makes the ship visible on the radar. Bond kick's ass and he kill's on the end Carver. He throws Carver in to the sea drill excellent. Bond is fired with machine guns and he fires back killing several Carver's man.Jonathan Pryce plays a good memorable villain, 'the emperor of the air,' Elliot Carver who was prepared to go to any length to increase the power of his media empire. If you think actor Jonathan Pryce did not a good job playing a bad guy. Watch him Ronin (1998) with Robert De Niro a year after this movie he played another bad guy.Götz Otto plays Stamper, the loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors. He was a good second bad guy but he wasn't memorable like Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.Judi Dench is once again as M and she is more handsome and awesome than she was in GoldenEye. She is a good heart person in this movie I thought the actress did her job well. Samantha Bond, Joe Don Baker and Desmond Llewellyn - all reprise their ""GoldenEye"" roles.Michelle Yeoh did a good job as Wai Lin the new Bond girl she was awarded for the role of Wai Lin. A martial artist of considerable skills, she preferred to work alone - until she begins to trust 007.Carver's wife Paris was played by the great beauty, Teri Hatcher was excellent as Paris Carver's wife. She was good in her role and her performance. After an assassin kill's Carver's wife here we seen Bond's remorse and feelings, not a stone killer like Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) is the eighteenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond.

98,eminkl,I would consider Tomorrow Never Dies middling at best.,5,17 April 2020,"When war horns bellow between China and the UK, MI6 sends their resident super-spy to get to the bottom of the grievance. It doesn't take much detective work to discover the man most likely to profit from such international conflict: media mogul Elliot Carver, who just so happens to have launched a 24-hour news network in time to broadcast the opening volleys. It's a forward-thinking concept for the franchise, asking pertinent questions about the rooting interests of the press, but the whole affair is painted in rather broad strokes, every dilemma solved with the same rudimentary answer: shoot bullets until the problem goes away. Preferably in a big, round, satisfying fireball. Carver is a role that could have been really interesting, a menacing mash-up of Steve Jobs and Rupert Murdoch, and I would've loved to see Anthony Hopkins tackle it, as originally cast. Alas, his departure after a mere three days left the part to Jonathan Pryce, who really hams it up (even by Bond villain standards) and spoils the character's potential. Not that the thin, rushed script did him many favors. His henchmen are severely lacking, too, a rather pedestrian clan without much in the way of muscle or panache. So we've got James, plus special guest-star Michelle Yeoh (a highly stereotypical, but effective, shot of adrenaline), mowing through a crowd of red shirts en route to a lackluster final showdown with the scrawny, intellectual owner of a media empire.

101,agmoldham,One of the weaker Bonds,4,25 April 2004,"Tomorrow Never Dies is certainly one of the weaker Bond movies. It's strange to say that given that the story is probably one of the more believable ones in terms of the plot.Elliot Carver (Pryce) is the head of a huge worldwide media company. As such he has massive influence on the events of the world and a huge personal fortune. This is not that far from the truth at the moment, but  the plot never quite delivers. The acting is fairly weak throughout and the Bond girls are not really up to scratch here. As usual some of the stunts are quite impressive, but this is the weakest of the Brosnan Bond films to date. 6/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
102,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,High-tech Bond.,8,12 December 2007,"This high-tech sequel Bond entry has Bond up against a media czar. Pierce Brosnan once again portrays the suave and slick secret agent, but it Jonathan Pryce, as the villain Elliot Carver, that steals the show. Pryce plays the textbook villain character in a deliciously evil manner that fits the comic book nature of Bond seamlessly. Not many Bond villain actors have been able to capture that quite so well. Also the villains premise is rather interesting, he is not a bad-guy with an army, but one that can persuade armies to do his bidding. The words as weapons idea is also frighteningly relevant with the internet media craze that was, when the film came out, pushing inexorably to where it is now. Only here, a bad-guy owns it all, or at least, that's his goal. As result this entry seems ""up-to-date"" unlike Goldeneye that, despite being a great Bond film, seemed unable to place Bond in a world without the USSR. Surprising, since a few of the Roger Moore films and more recently, Licence to Kill, did just that rather nicely.The gadgetry has been seriously amped up from Goldenye's rather limited and practical use of gadgets. Here not only does Bond have a standard issue Double-O car complete with ""all the usual refinements,"" it's remote controllable and has self re-inflating tires. He matches wits with a Chinese Secret agent who's a Bond girl (one of few) that can really kick it. In addition the bad-guys have their own set of high-tech tools and weapons. The pyrotechnics may seen a bit out of hand during a few sequences with some serious destruction being caused. So much that it can feel forced in order to get yet another thrill from the audience. However, despite that this is a strong entry in the ever-likable Bond franchise. The villain is fresh, the action great and there are some new edges given to the Bond girls that previous films haven't quite seen. --- 8/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action.

103,K3nzit,Falls flat in almost every department,5,28 December 2019,"The beginning of a downwards spiral for Brosnan as Bond. This one falls flat in almost every department, but its weakest link is the story. The opening sequence is one of few highlights found here.",Tomorrow Never Dies
104,kenandraf,Welcome back Bond!,9,1 November 2000,"This movie has made up for all the recent bad Bond movies made.Brosnan changed his look for this one and leared from his mistakes in Goldeneye.Very well done with regards to action and special effects.The direction and cinematography was also splendid.The producers have also finally found a proper 90's atmosphere for Bond.This film has set the standard for the new Bond formula.Complaints about the unrealistic storyline is unfounded.Wake up nay sayers.How realistic can DR. No and Goldfinger be?Both mentioned films being considered model Bond movies.The unrealism must be eclipsed by great entertainment and innovative fim making.The Bond movies are a great vehicle for innovative action film making and given this,Tomorrow Never Dies delivers.Another annoying complaint by others is that the villain here was not menacing.Once again,in other Bond classics,the big boss is not required to be a physical specimen.Many versions of Blofeld and even Goldfinger himself were menacing in other ways.One more comlaint I did not like was that there was too much Rambo like shooting.In other classic Bond films,there are a lot of shootings galore.The difference is that in this film,the shooting scenes were more graphic and there is nothing wrong with that becouse it is time the Bond films took it to the next level in these scenes.Why should the Bond films get left behind in this area when it is the pinnacle of all action films?Yup!Brosnan was lighting it up with that rapid fire weapon and it was done the right way!James was never handled this way when he was given a weapon like that before and it was about time he was portrayed with little compromise this way.This film is not better than the best of Connery and Moore but this one rates among the best Bond films all time.I'm so happy Brosnan grew into it.I hated his weak portrayal in Goldeneye but I still knew adjustments here and there would fix it.Tomorrow Never Dies realised my desire for Brosnan's Bond.I knew he could do it this way ever since I saw him in the old Remington Steele TV series back in 1983.I knew he had to toughen up physically and get a haircut.He did both and became Bond.

105,mikayakatnt,Modern retelling of the Spy Who Loved Me,7,4 March 2020,"I love James Bond. I love Pierce Brosman's performance of 007.But honestly, the video game is better than this film. Tomorrow Never Dies has some underlying messages of the power of media-gone-wrong, but nothing about this film proves memorable. I actually had to refresh my memory by Youtubing scenes to remember what happened in this movie.2/5. Good action but forgettable in the era of the late 90s/early 2000s action movie boom.When I first watched this film, I didn't like it. Revisiting this film, I learned to appreciate it more as a true installment in the franchise.The first film without Albert Broccoli (RIP) that was true in spirit to his vision of James Bond.Tomorrow Never Dies (such a silly name) is a modern retelling of The Spy Who Loved Me with some changes to make it more fitting for a modern audience. It's my honest opinion that this film should be revisited and reexamined.Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of a more stylish, sleek, and tongue-in-cheek Bond is there. Action is satisfying and locations are exotic. Instead of a malevolent USSR or SPECTRE, we get the capitalist bogeyman as the antagonist. This makes the film much more relatable to today's world.Tomorrow Never Dies is a world where mass media has gotten too powerful and tries to start WWIII. Though I find it hard to imagine a media mogul buying a top-of-the-line stealth cruiser without anyone noticing, themes still echo today. Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) is an excellent hybrid of Steve Jobs' visionary idealism with Rupert Murdoch's ruthlessness. An artistic difference from the USSR or the evil shadow empire of SPECTRE.The anti-Bond strongman of Stamper (Gotz Otto) was an enjoyable portrayal that echos of Robert Shaw's performance of Red Grant in From Russia with Love. Though a bit more expressive, Gotz had an intimidating appearance on screen.Another aspect that I enjoyed about this film is the role of strong female characters. Early on we get M's flawless clapback of a general. Also, the Bond girl in this film, Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) plays a strong female counterweight to Bond. She acts as a non-passive character, acts independently of Bond, and is strong/smart enough to hold her own.Of course, there are some faults. Besides the title name makes no sense, there are some things I wished the film developed more. TND could have built more upon the media causing mayhem for views (something we can all relate to in 2020). Also, I was saddened to see that Paris Carver's (Teri Hatcher) and Dr. Kaufman's (Vincent Schiavelli) characters were not developed. They could have been much more interesting characters.But, it's a Bond movie. It's meant to be enjoyed more than examined for deep thinking.3.5/5. Good movie but with some flaws. Still a good watch many years after",Tomorrow Never Dies
106,perfectbond,A letdown from Goldeneye,6,17 November 2003,"While this movie had its strong points like Brosnan's confident performance as Bond and a villain whose plan seemed feasible, its weak points marred the experience. First there was the totally unnecessary martial arts scene with Michelle Yeoh. If I wanted to watch a kung fu movie I would've watched a Jackie Chan film. Second Yeoh's appearance is not glamorous enough for a Bond girl and Teri Hatcher though better isn't spectacular and also wasn't given enough screen time. As a villain Carver is not in the top tier, though to be fair he isn't dreadful either. Pryce is a good actor. I'm not sure anyone could add more to this blandly written character than he could. The blond physical baddie is something we have seen countless times before. They weren't even trying to come up with something fresh! On the plus side the pre-credit fighter plane sequence was exhilarating and I appreciate the technical execution of the motorcycle chase sequence. The shootout at the end, however, was yet more evidence of a lack of originality. Overall, 6/10. As an aside the Playstation game based on this movie was a disaster especially when compared with the Nintendo 64 masterpiece Goldeneye.",Tomorrow Never Dies
107,timdalton007,Disappointing,7,9 May 2006,"With the surprising success of Goldeneye, it was apparent that James Bond had successfully entered the post-Cold War world intact and as popular as ever. Pierce Brosnan seems to be more assured of what he is doing in many scenes and he is more into the Bond character's mindset as shown in many scenes in particular the scene in the hotel room when he kills Kaufman and in the scenes at Carver's building in Saigon. He also seems a more fit in the film's action sequences, particularly in the fight sequences at Carver's HQ in Hamburg. There is little at fault in Brosnan's performance as he does well in the action scenes, his one liner delivery, and the emotional scenes with Paris Carver. The Bond girl of the film, Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin, is another great character. This character is truly every bit the agent Bond is and more then once she manages to out do Bond in the action sequences. The character is a truly original one and though the character may be a bit too tough for a Bond girl, it is other wise a perfect example of what a modern Bond girl should be. Michele Yeoh's performance in the film is another highpoint in the film as she manages to practically steal the scenes she is in. It is true that she falls into the Bond girl cliché of needing to be rescued by 007, but Bond does not actually rescue her. Wai Lin is the Bond girl for the modern era. In the form of Jonathon Pryce's Elliot Carver we get something we haven't seen in a while: a truly well written and performed megalomaniac villain.. Carver is, next to License To Kill's Franz Sanchez, perhaps the most realistic villain of the series. Carver could easily exist in the modern world of 24 hour news that seems to have more influence in influencing governments then the actual events do. Carver is also a very intelligent character who is far from stupid. He is a strangely funny and for the most part likable character during his scenes in public and behind the scenes he is what many of us fear to be true of those in power: evil enough to make events go their way for their own dark agenda. This is what makes the character and Pryce's performance all the more interesting. Pryce pulls the character off without a hitch and manages to give off a virtually flawless performance in the film as he is so convincing one might to begin wondering if media moguls are really like this in real life. The rest of the cast is one of the better supporting casts of the Bond series. Teri Hatcher is splendid in her small but pivotal role of Paris Carver, the old flame who comes back into Bond's mission and his life. Thought he character is ultimately a sacrificial lamb of the film, her demise is made all the more meaningful due to her relationship with Bond in the few scenes she is in. Judi Dench returns to the role of M and while one might go in expecting the same M from Goldeneye, but they come out with a different impression. This M has apparently been impressed by Bond enough in Goldeneye that she is more towards the M of old who, while disapproving of Bond's style, knows that only Bond can get the job done and this is quite refreshing. The scenes with Q and Moneypeny return for some of the best scenes of between the characters and Bond in years. In particular, the phone conversation between Bond and Moneypenny and the Q's introduction of the BMW in Hamburg stand out as highlights in the film. The action sequences in the film are a problem. The teaser sequence manages do something that is rare among action sequences: it manages to be both suspenseful and exciting at the same time. The scenes where the stealth ship sinks the British warship is a well staged and suspenseful sequences. The same can be said of the fight scenes at the Carver HQ in Hamburg. But the film's best action sequence is the car chase in the Hamburg parking garage. Featuring the novel idea of a remotely operated full sized car with all the gadgets a Bond fan can ask for, along with some terrific music from David Arnold, this car chase is easily the best sequence of the like to appear in a Bond film. But the rest of the action sequences in film after the suspenseful dive on the warship fall flat, minus the Wai Lin fight sequence. Both the motorcycle chase and the battle sequence on the stealth boat are reminiscent of similar sequences in other Bond films that were done much better in those films. There is also the issue of the storyline. The idea of Carver building a stealth boat, sinking a British warship, shooting down a Chinese fighter plane, nuking the Chinese and causing the sinking of British fleet for only exclusive rights to air in China is all but laughably ludicrous and only causes the films over reliance on action to seem worse then probably is. David Arnold's score manages to bring some classic Bond score elements into the film and at times it s hard to believe that Barry didn't compose of the music. The music accompanying the teaser sequence is reminiscent of some of the classic Barry action music of the early Bond films and the music manages to play incredibly well into the scenes were suspense is most needed. Despite the good acting and the top notch score, the films over reliance on a over the top storyline, action sequences, and two week major supporting characters, hurts the film considerably to the point of dropping down from a well above average Bond film to a below average Bond film.",Tomorrow Never Dies
108,redkiwi,"Corny, but never made the heights",6,27 December 2000,"Despite the most annoying theme tune in Bond history, this film isn't all that bad - without ever really being any good.Featuring the famous Moneypenny line: ""You always were a cunning linguist James"", this was cornier than most other Bond films, and the interplay between Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench that works so well on the small screen did come across well on film also.In memory of Cubbi Broccoli, this is typical Christmas fare that you can watch without ever getting too much into it.  Pierce Brosnan is OK, but not anything special as 007.",Tomorrow Never Dies
109,Bogmeister,BOND#18: the Media Goes Berserk Tomorrow,7,5 August 2007,"MASTER PLAN: trick Britain and China into a war, gaining exclusive broadcasting rights to the whole mess. The teaser is a little too cute, rather than impressive. The title song, by Sheryl Crow, has a moaning quality to it, but grows on you. Brosnan's 2nd Bonder has a slightly more flippant tone compared to the previous one, ""Goldeneye,"" which was fairly serious throughout, and creates an uneasy impression of falling back to the worst Roger Moore Bonders, where he was smirking in half the movie. Thankfully, it doesn't get as bad in this one and Brosnan is actually more relaxed in the role, but the villainous plot is something out of a mediocre comic book. If you think about it for more than a few seconds, the main villain's motives make no sense: he, Carver (Pryce), is patterned on real life media moguls such as Rupert Murdoch and previous super-wealthy megalomaniacs such as Zorin (""A View to a Kill"") and Goldfinger. He's already very rich and, as demonstrated in an early comic book-style scene of media manipulation, already has his grubby fingers on most of the controls that rule the world. He already has the power and the underhanded schemes he employs before his master plan in this film would probably have never gained the attention of entities like MI6 and Bond. Why start this crazy fracas? He really has very little to gain besides a little extra dough (I guess) even if completely successful in this new scheme. Maybe he had some fixation on China, where he plans to gain exclusive broadcasting rights. Or, maybe, as Bond says outloud at one point, he's simply mad. The actor, Pryce, certainly plays him as an over-the-top bonkers geek, as if he gazed at too many numbers one day and snapped. He spends his time creating headlines rather than reporting them, printing the news before everyone else and gleefully clicking his personal console as reports of disasters & scandals reach his throbbing ears. He's a walking cautionary tale of channeled information distributed in a deranged manner to the unsuspecting masses - but it's presented as so much dark farce, it's hard to take him too seriously by the time Bond decides to permanently end his career aspirations.Bond teams up with a Chinese agent (Yeoh) in this one and she's pretty much the best thing about this picture. Yeoh plays this straight, with no quirky mannerisms, and her martial arts scenes are expectedly energetic. Former TV Lois Lane and future Desperate Housewife Hatcher fares less well in a brief role as the villain's wife and former Bond flame. She's a competent TV actress here, no more. Bond's usual allies (M, Moneypenny, Q, CIA liaison Jack Wade) are all back, though in briefer roles. Bond does get a new automobile (a BMW 750-it's no Aston Martin, but apparently its windows can take sledgehammer hits), which he puts through quite a few paces, mostly in a big parking garage, though he spends most of his time hunched down in the back seat, operating it via remote control - it's different yet a bit too cutesy. The mission takes him to Hamburg, Germany, where there's a tense scene of him getting beaten up before turning the tables and then Saigon, where, after an exciting escape down the side of a building, there's a lengthy motorcycle chase. It ends up on some 'stealth' boat in the middle of an ocean, where the villain spends way too much time bragging about his incredible plan. There's yet another tall blonde Aryan henchman to deal with (see also ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""The Living Daylights"" and etc.). Despite the overly flamboyant villain, this is not a very memorable Bonder; you remember the motorcycle stunt over the helicopter, but not much else. On a recent viewing, I was struck by how emotional this Bond gets when he loses an ally - say, a female one - it's too emotional for my taste, since if he gets this way each time, he wouldn't last long in this game (Connery had figured that out - he would go on after a shrug). On the other end of the scale, Bond's confrontation scene with 'the doctor' henchman comes across as a parody of the usual spy stuff. Overall, this uneven tone plagues much of this Bonder. Also, curiously, the song by KD Lang at the end credits is better than the singing over the beginning ones. Bond would return in ""The World is Not Enough.""

It literally goes against the laws of physics and thus is not only impossible, but also a huge plot-hole.There's another scene where the bad-guys shoot with automatic weapons in the public... and yet the police never show up. That's way too convenient, unrealistic, and creates yet another plot-hole.And at one time Bond has a freeking missile launcher, yet he doesn't use it to blow up the bad-guys, yet there's like 20 guys shooting at him.And at the end, the main bad guy literally just STANDS THERE and dies, while he could very, very, very easily just have moved out of the way and he would have survived.

On the way Bond meets up with his former lover, played by the beautiful Teri Hatcher who is now Carver's wife. Bond joins forces with Wai Lin played by the amazing Michelle Yeoh and the Motorbike chase is better than most car chases in certain other films I can think of. the action is fantastic.Only down side is the ending which seems a bit of an anti-climax, but overall another brilliant Bond film by the amazing Mr Brosnan.",Tomorrow Never Dies

114,FilmFanInTheHouse,Not as bad as others say,8,13 March 2007,"Tomorrow Never Dies was the 18th Bond film produced by EON productions and for the second time starred Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there is something different about Bond in this. The film isn't as bad as other Bond fans say it is. The story is the usual 'villain wants to take over the world' storyline, but this time is from a different approach. Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) is an interesting Bond villain as he doesn't have the looks of a Bond villain, plus owning a newspapers company isn't really a villains profession, but once the action picks up, the character does become very menacing.The other characters also have a change of pace. M (Judi Dench) seems more involved with Bond, as does Moneypenny. The two Bond girls in this movie also are different. The main Bond girl, Wai Lin (Michelle Yoeh) is probably the most action involved Bond girl out of any of the previous ones. The romance between a Bond girls happens more with Paris Carver (Teri Hatcher) but her story is cut short through the film, when the character is killed off.The music is superb and David Arnold really brings a new feel to the soundtrack of Bond, which hopefully would retain him in place as composer for many more films in the future. Although it's not as long as the other Bond movies, with it's running time at less than 2 hours, it's still action packed with a fantastic explosive car chase through a car park being the highlight of the action.James Bond will return in The World Is Not Enough",Tomorrow Never Dies

116,jhaggardjr,"Fine follow-up to ""Goldeneye""",9,14 May 2000,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is the 18th James Bond film, with Pierce Brosnan back as 007.

Even though ""Titanic"" went on to break box office records, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was not left in the dust.

Jonathan Pryce is a major standout as Elliot Carver, the megalomaniacal media magnate Bond faces off against.  The other standout: Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin, Bond's female sidekick who makes a fine companion for Bond. Brosnan is fine as 007 as he was in ""Goldeneye"", and also returning for the second time are Joe Don Baker as CIA agent Jack Wade, Judi Dench as ""M"", Samantha Bond as ""Miss Moneypenny"", and Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"".

117,dfle3,"Action packed finale, mix of good jokes and bad...77.5/100",8,15 September 2010,"19th of 23 Bond movies (18th of 22 official Bond movies) A pretty solid effort for Pierce Brosnan's second movie as secret agent James Bond. The finale was action packed and humour was injected some more into this movie...sometimes it worked, other times it spluttered.Exotic locations: Germany and China (the latter has some picture-esquire island scenery).Plot: Media mogul Elliot Carver needs some content for a new 24 hour satellite news channel. So, he thinks starting World War III would be good for ratings. For Australians who remember sketch comedy show ""The comedy company"", Carver's media group will be reminiscent of ""Bastards Inc.""! In that sense, this aspect of the story is initially overplayed and arch. Some aspects of Carver and his life resemble that of ex-Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch...perhaps more parallels have occurred since the movie came out...so I'm not sure if all the parallels are intentional. Anyway, using high technology, Carver plans to get Britain and China into a war with each other by fooling them into thinking that each has been attacked by the other. There may be a credibility gap here...can you believe that Britain would go to war against a country somewhat larger than Argentina? This is perhaps the first Bond movie to have social commentary at its heart...commenting on the role of media mogul's in society.Franchise clichés: Pre-title sequence - The gun barrel sequence drops the techno music that marked Brosnan's debut in the role and brings back the Monty Norman theme, without the part carrying the immediately identifiable bass lick. The sequence proper is good, concerning a terrorist arms fair on the Russian border.Theme song - Features Sheryl Crow. Possibly has the best accompanying visuals of the franchise to this point.Q - Check.M - Check. She has some good sexual innuendo comments with Bond.Moneypenny - Check. This character is back to being wallpaper. In the previous movie - GoldenEye - Moneypenny had something to say. The last time she was remotely interesting before then was with the greatest Bond movie of them all...""On her majesty's secret service"".Silly female character names - Out of fashion...again.Wine buffery - Teri Hatcher's character - Paris Carver - utters the immortal but seldom used phrase ""Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred"". At the time of writing Hatcher had made a mark for herself as a long standing cast member of night time soap ""Desperate housewives"". Here she plays Elliot's wife and...a former love interest of Bond.Sexism/misogny - Hmm...I wonder when the last time I filled out this section with content was.End teaser - No. In fact, there are no end credits at all, to speak of, I think...unless the television network here cut them to make more room...for ads. The only credit you see is: ""In loving memory of ALBERT R. ""CUBBY"" BROCCOLI"" Cubby was the producer involved in this franchise right from the very first Bond movie, with Sean Connery...""Dr.No"".Watch for: * a naval ship which has control buttons marked ""PEACE"" and ""WAR"". Hmm! * Bond learning Danish...would that all language lessons like that! He also speaks German. I'm sure that Bond could command any chair in any school of languages at any university. He's pretty much got all the languages down pat! * Not sure, but there may be an obvious stunt double in one fight scene.* Bond finding a magazine called ""Sex spiele"" in a safe. Just used Google's translation service to arrive at the English translation...""sex games"". Hmm...I wonder what George Lazenby's Bond would have done with it! * Good twist in humour with a scene between Bond and a man reprising his role in a David Cronenberg movie! * Has a leading contender for one of the silliest scenes in a Bond movie...the electric can opener type device on Bond's car...hmmm.* Got a definition of ""HALO jump"" here: High Altitude Low Opening jump. Not sure how realistic this scene was...you're meant to open your parachute around 200 feet over the water...it looked like it opened just a few metrest above water. Not qualified to comment on the accuracy of the representation...don't try it at home in any case kids! * One character is part of the Chinese People's External Security Force...not sure if this is a real organisation. Bond mentions that the Makarov 59 is the standard issue Chinese Army pistol. Wikipedia confirms this assertion.* When Elliot Carver isn't being a total pantomime character, he does deliver one of the great lines by a Bond villain: ""The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success"". Sure, not as pointed or narky as Sir Hugo Drax's comments to Roger Moore's Bond could be, but still quotable! * A good one liner delivered by Bond after one henchman's Chakra spiel.* For those who remember the British sit-com ""Mind your language"", there is a scene in this movie where Wai Lin pretty much does an impression of the Chinese woman's usual spiels in that sit-com...but tongue in cheek.* Elliot Carver quoting US media mogul William Randolph Hearst: ""You provide the pictures, I'll provide the war"" when speaking to a photographer in his employ. I've just done a very superficial search of this phrase on Google...the quote may be apocryphal.* It's not exactly clear, but there does seem to be some subtext when a Chinese character in the movie has a Walther gun and wrist watch in their possession. Some connection with Q, perhaps? * Just by the by, contrast the countdown to potential catastrophe in this movie to that in ""Octopussy"" (with Roger Moore playing Bond)...the latter had real time, whilst this movie has heavily dilated time.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Tomorrow Never Dies is now, thanks to The World is not Enough, the second best Bond film. The top three Bond films are all with Peirce Brosnan, coinsedence? I think not. This time around, 007 is joined, literaly, with the beautiful Michelle Yeoh to defeat Elliot Carver and keep WWIII from breaking out between the Brit's and the Chinese. This movie was filmed just at the peak of Teri Hatcher's (T.V.'s Adventures of Superman)career. She is as beautiful as ever in her role as Elliot Carver's sexy wife, Paris. by the end of this movie you will be on the edge of your seat, and if you can find a better helicopter/motorcycle scene in any other film, please e-mail me.",Tomorrow Never Dies
119,bsinc,A terrible excuse of a Bond movie,4,18 March 2002,"Let me just get to the point. THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE. There is not a single nice thing that I can say about this movie (the ONLY thing I can think of are the super attractive babes surrounding the villain at the party, just before Bond pops in, and that's it!!!). One of the worst Bond movies ever (the worst being ""The world is not enough""). I don't have a problem with Pierce Brosnan, he is arguably the second best bond ever (and for all you reading this, pondering who the best Bond is; here's a clue, he's a 6'1 high ape descendant, although come to think of it, he's almost as hairy as the next ape; yeeeeees, that's right, you ""guessed"" it, Sean Connery - but of courssse!). Now, on to the trashing of this 007 fiasco.To begin with, I saw this movie yesterday and can hardly remember the opening scene, that's how big an impact it made.Next, Judy Dench is terrible as ""M"". She just isn't cut out for the part and is quite annoying, showing lack of talent(the lame laugh she gives after supposedly ""suppresses"" Admiral Roebuck, who by the by is played by the same guy who starred (is married to) with Judy Dench in a popular British TV show; I guess the film makers wanted to show the couple can show their acting abilities in a Bond movie as well, therefore inserting this lovely dialogue: Admiral Roebuck: With all due respect, M, I don't think you have the balls for this. M: Perhaps. The advantage is I don't have to think with them all the time. Believe me, it's SO lame when you see it.Teri Hatcher(although quite stunning) is kind of boring and I don't understand why she is married to the villain, definitely not because she loves him.Next, the action scenes are boring and show nothing new or even the least bit interesting, just the typical stuff. Also, I thought there wasn't enough man to man contact, just boring movie shooting with ammo that never runs out. The car is OK, but I hate that BMW has a contract or I don't know what with Bond movies, since theirs are the only cars (and bikes; make no mistake - when Bond and the Chinese girl are running from the bad guys a range of bikes magically presents itself. But that isn't the bogus part; it's the bike they ""accidentally"" choose that reeks of propaganda because you notice the BMW logo on its side)that are, and will be shown. How lame.The villain isn't that bad, but is not very believable when it comes to a motive - POWER, what else, but that's so recycled and boring.Many mistakes; the worst being the scale of the undetectable villain boat, that changes with almost every scene.No fancy gadgets, just the boring watch and a car that talks.Again Judy Dench.And is it just me or were the film makers trying to change just about everything. The British headquarters look too computer-like and they ruined Moneypenny's character. She used to be flirty and attractive, now she's just a red haired bitch with a cell phone. At first I thought that ""Goldeneye"" was junk, but after seeing it again I must say it's the Best Bond movie since ""Octopussy"",with a great opening scene (sure it's not realistic, but it's great fun to watch), beautiful women and it possesses some of that old Bond movies charm. It has a weak ending, but hey, they all do. If you're wondering; my favorite Bond movie is ""From Russia with love"", followed by :""Dr. No"", ""Goldfinger"", ""The spy who loved me""...........
This movie lacked charisma, memorable scenes(not even one memorable scene), credibility and that Bond atmosphere that could make even the worst of Bonds likeable. I gave it a better grade that it deserves.         4/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
120,domino1003,Teri Hatcher...You are the weakest link. Goodbye!,8,9 July 2005,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" would have been a perfect film, with the exception of one cast member: Teri Hatcher.Now don't get me wrong. I happen to like Teri Hatcher very much. Her role in this film, however, was a total waste. But I'll get back to her in a moment.Bond (Pierce Brosnan), is sent by M (Judi Dench) to investigate the disappearance of a British battleship in the South China Seas. This leads him to Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), a media mogul (Think Ted Turner with a British accent). Carver knows about the problem of the battleship because he was the one behind it: Because the Chinese government doesn't want his presence in their country, he decides to create a war between the British government and the Chinese government so he can make his media empire totally global (Man, does this guy have a huge ego or what?).This is where Teri Hatcher comes into play: she plays Paris Carver, former flame of Bond, current wife of Elliot. Her role just becomes wasteful, if only to show Bond feeling guilt over her.There is another Bond girl, the very beautiful Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), who is a secret agent of the Chinese government, and can take very good care of herself.Cool stunts in the film (Like Bond and Lin sliding down the side of a skyscraper, handcuffed), and the gadgets are cool(Don't you wish you had a car like Bond's?). However, this villain compared to others is rather weak. All in all, it was still a good film to watch.",Tomorrow Never Dies
121,willcundallreview,"An OK Brosnan Bond, full of action",6,21 May 2014,"Rating-6/10Tomorrow Never Dies is a Bond that never lacks the ambition to go full throttle with the action but also show Bond's personal side off as well. With big gadgets and a plot that some may find straight forward but I found it to be well put together at most points, you shouldn't be bored by this second Bond film by Brosnan. Overall I felt it was firmly an OK movie, and here below is why I felt that about it.The story as said is a good plot, works well with a villain trying to create news stories for his own financial benefit, Bond in the story works his way adventurously thorough different countries and even the bottom of the sea at one point. It can be fast at parts then suddenly speed up and the story isn't done so well it deserves a medal, but OK entertainment nonetheless. I felt the end slows slightly and affects it but otherwise it is worth a watch and I feel some may really like this.Pierce Brosnan is back as Bond and he is good, he isn't the one who affects the film and he brings all the elements he had in Goldeneye back for this one too. He brings a Bond full of surprises and delivers some of the best quips of all time. Jonathan Pryce as the villain is well, not so evil looking but still his mind is completely crazy and he becomes one of those Bond villains who is able to mix insanity with a bit of humour too. Michelle Yeoh as the Bond girl is OK but maybe she lacks the certain things that some of the other girls can bring to the series.It is not written or directed particularly well but it isn't of care as you feel Brosnan controls the scenes and even if the dialogue is a little stingy, Brosnan does at times manage to save the film from utter repute. I like the gadgets, they are fun and what we expect from Bond, over the top as hell but still they are fun to see and without some of the gadgets used in this movie, we would be without some key and great action scenes.The film lacks a true substance, that is the main criticism here as the premise is not a bad one but the people behind this movie really fail to bring a good story out and a Bond who has met his match, it isn't good enough simple. You could also say this over uses action, if you look back after watching you kind of think about the constant explosions and when using his gadgets, the kind of useless action that isn't rationally needed.Bond series fans should enjoy it as it brings what Bond is again, some may dislike the constant action and even the more darker tones, but it shouldn't bother too much. For anyone looking for a humorous Bond, this isn't it as although Pryce is funny at times and Brosnan delivers some good lines in the line of comedy, there isn't enough and as said, overall it takes on a much more darker tone than say Roger Moore's portrayal of James Bond.Overall I give this a 6/10, it is Firmly an OK movie, I felt like being nice here, I could have said this lacks everything but watching it you can't help feel that Brosnan tries hard here and manages a good job out of it. Probably not the best of Brosnans acts of Bond but worth a good watch, if your watching all the Bonds in order, this one may let you down after Goldeneye, as a one off, best if those who enjoy much more action in a film see this one as it is jam packed with it all, guns are firing everywhere.",Tomorrow Never Dies
122,majikstl,"""Martinis, girls, and guns... It's murder on our love affair.""",5,6 December 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how TOMORROW NEVER DIES rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: TOMORROW NEVER DIES: Poetic pretension aside, the ""Tomorrow"" in this case is the name of a newspaper. And the film's original title was ""Tomorrow Never Lies,"" a more mundane slogan, but not nearly suitable for a Bond film. 8 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Bond interrupts the sale of various illegal weapons and casually stops a nuclear disaster in the bargain. Another elaborate teaser with Bond escaping the bad guys at the last minute, leaving a bunch of explosions in his wake. Nicely done, I suppose, but old hat. 5 points.Opening Credits: After Daniel Kleinman's debut work on the credits for GOLDENEYE, his graphics here are particularly disappointing. There is almost a generic quality to Kleinman's choice of images, reflecting the worst of Maurice Binder's prototypes. Worse, the disturbing shots of the female body made up of circuits and micro chips is rather creepy re- enforcing the clichéd concept of Bond Girls as mere objects. 2 points.Theme Song: It may not be the all-time worst Bond theme song, but Sheryl Crowe's ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" cowritten with Richard Froom, just might be the most sleep-inducing. Perhaps she is trying to imitate the great Shirley Bassey, but Crowe's drowsy rendition is listless and just downright dreary. A second theme song ends the film; k. d. lang's ""Surrender"" is somewhat better than Crowe's contribution -- but not by much. It's strange, but by this time the producers of the series are picking and choosing from multiple submissions from various noted artists, yet they still end up selecting themes songs that are, at best, mediocre. 2 points.""Bond, James Bond"": As Bond, Pierce Brosnan seems to be trying awfully hard to not crack so much as a smile, thus when he does seem to be enjoying himself it's cause for applause. After the sardonic style he restored to the character in GOLDENEYE, it is disheartening to see him returning to the glum approach that Timothy Dalton took. 4 points.Bond Babes: Somewhere between being Lois Lane and becoming a Desperate Housewife, Teri Hatcher added ""Bond Girl"" to her resume. Alas, she brought none of her proved gift for playing spunky heroines with a comic touch to the role; as the villain's depressed ill-fated wife, she may be the most morose Bond Girl of all time. But she is balanced out in glorious style by Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin, a Chinese agent who teams up with 007, both on his mission and on some of the best staged stunts of the series. While sex and sexiness have all but faded from the Bond films, Yeoh personifies the evolution of the Bond Girl to that of a strong and dynamic professional. 10 points.Bond Villain: Of all the villains James has faced, Elliott Carver just might be the most insipid. Though played by the very talented Jonathan Pryce, the character is a power-mad media mogul who hopes to start World War III, so he can have exclusive rights to cover it with his print and broadcast outlets. That is a lot of effort for such a meager pay back. Though prone to occasional temper tantrums, the owlish Carver is about as threatening as a junior high school principal who is upset about graffiti on the boys room wall. 1 point.Bond Baddies: Vincent Schiavelli is one of those actors born to play a bad guy. With his sad, droopy Salvadore Dali face, he instantly gave character to any role just by his presence. Here, as assassin Dr. Kaufman, he is rather subdued, but he gives a nice comic twist to the character's dour professionalism. He is assisted by his protégé, Stamper, who unfortunately is played far less memorably by Götz Otto. Stamper is yet another cold, emotionless Ayran killer in the Donald Grant mold and, while he is a formidable opponent in battle, he is a dull character otherwise. 7 points.Sinister Plot: There are just so many holes in Carver's dastardly plan that even the most far-fetched Bond action stunt is more believable. The idea that a publisher has to create news in order to have something to print is as old as yellow journalism, but there just isn't a whit of common sense in Carver's reckless drive to create a world war that would endanger, not expand his own media empire. Plus, what idiot would place in print stories about his own crimes, even before he committed them. He is just a stupid, stupid man and it is a stupid, stupid plot. 0 points.Production values: The film's saving grace is the remarkable stunt work featuring Bond and Wai Lin handcuffed together and escaping via motorcycle from the villain's helicopter, through the slums of Saigon. Obviously influenced by the over-the-top stunts work of Asian cinema, it provides quite a kick to an otherwise lackluster film. 8 points.Bonus Points: I don't know if it is social commentary or just motion picture showmanship, but once again we are treated to the mindless destruction of a poor Third World community. Though expertly done, the chase that runs amok in a crowded, impoverished Saigon neighborhood, terrorizing the poor and destroying their meager homes, all without a second thought, paints a vivid portrait of Super Power arrogance. We'll pretend it is meant as social commentary and add 5 points.Summary: What this film does best, it does very well. But it's negatives far outweigh its positives. TOMORROW doesn't die; it's already DOA.Bond-o-meter Rating: 52 points out of 100.",Tomorrow Never Dies
123,michaelarmer,Tomorrow Shags Are Off,7,7 April 2020,"This is ok, not as good as Brosnan's first though, but not his fault he is just as good as Bond, it's the story and screenplay it just seems very unlikely and some of the dialogue about controlling the media is a bit cheesy.It's still well made, not as well paced as Goldeneye, and relying a bit too much on fireball explosions for action, the scenes look a bit disjointed, but most of the action scenes are good, and the intro is brilliant. Locations are still a bit of a problem though, Filmed authentically in Hamburg and London is good, but the intro supposed to be in central Asia is made in France, Thailand doubles for Vietnam, because they couldn't get permission to film there, so is a good substitute. The music is ok, not great though, the Title song is Ok by Sheryl Crow, but again the end song is off, why they have had 2 different songs at the start and end for the last few films puzzles me, they should just have one great song for both.The cast is not as good as in Goldeneye as well, but not too far off, Jonathan Pryce does a good media megalomaniac; Joe Don Baker pops again as CIA Wade, but is a bit scruffy in his Hawaiian shirts. Geoffrey Palmer plays the Admiral with Judi Dench and Samantha Bond continuing well as M and Moneypenny. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) is still going strong. At least the actors get good characters to play, like in the last film and unlike in many previous bond movies.Most of the old Bond Themes are missing from this, and it shows, but they did have Helicopters (I do believe they have had Helicopters in every Bond movie so far), and a few gadgets including the remote control car. Henchmen: - One main one is Stamper played by German (again) Gotz Otto pretty well, but there are a few others, Dr Kaufman played by Vincent Schiavelli does a good cameo as a hitman/torturer and there are a few German thugs, with one main big older one who I could not find the names of. Cars: - An Aston Martin DB5 is at the start only, after that they use BMW 750s and a BMW motorbike (sponsorship), not so good.Bond Girls:- No.53 in the series is a Danish girl who Bond is shagging at the start who is supposed to be Prof, Ing Bergstrom (Cecilie Thomson-Denmark) and she is the most beautiful and extremely sexy, next is one of two main Bond Girls - Paris Carver (no.54) played by Teri Hatcher (USA) who is the wife of the megalomaniac, so a baddie, Bond shags her when she is sent to recce him, and dies soon after, the other one is Wei Lin (no.55) played by Michelle Yeoh a Chinese Malaysian, who is working for Chinese Secret Service and they team together, her martial arts skills come in handy for the action scenes as well as being quite beautiful, Bond nails her at the end.So despite the story/screenplay, it's still got lots of good elements, and still better than several Bond Films.",Tomorrow Never Dies
124,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,7 March 2005,"A step down from Goldeneye, but definitely better than the two most recent Bond films, Tomorrow never Dies sees Bond coming up against a media psychopath after the disappearance of yet another ship. Bond travels to China and eventually teams up with Wai Lin, a Chinese Agent also sent to investigate. It seems Carver is intending to become to top, and only media boss on the planet, gaining 100% viewer coverage of every event, and will stop at nothing to achieve this, killing all who try to stop him. As the Chinese are the only people who stand in his way he intends to start a war between them and the British. Along the way, Bond meets an old flame Paris Carver, who ironically is now married to the jealous maniac. Bond tracks down Carver's headquarters and attempts to bring down Carver, thus saving the day again.The emotional content of Goldeneye is almost lost here, only the relationship between Bond and Paris (played by Hatcher) holds this theme up. The score at times works well, but this is a return to a more simple Bond formula- Bond must stop villain, no time for women in his life. Pryce puts in a strong performance, but his character is a pastiche of all who have come before. His henchmen are strong, but nothing marks them out like Oddjob or Jaws. Yeoh is very good as Lin, matching Bond at every turn, and doing most of her own stunts. In truth it is the action that is foremost here, and there is plenty of it. The motorbike chase and the remote car are both good, as well as the final encounter. All of the stunts are executed well, and Brosnan retains his charm proving he was perfect for the role. The story may lack the spark of Goldeneye, but it is still very watchable and believable in the modern age.7.5 out of 10.",Tomorrow Never Dies

130,TheHonestCritic,"Yes, it's true..... Tomorrow does not ever die, but I wish this ""film"" would!",4,21 August 2020,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" (1997), here we have Pierce Brosnan's second movie as the legendary character, James Bond. Wow, where do I begin? Now granted, it's not as bad as ""GoldenEye"" (1995), but it's almost as disappointing though! Any way, this ""film"" has a messy and dull story, overall mediocre acting and a generic boring soundtrack. Of course, the most exciting scene in this ""movie"" is the pre-title sequence. Those are usually the most exciting parts of any Bond film. Ironically, the scene that has little to nothing to do with the main plot is the best part of the ""film""! The storyline at first glance does sound interesting and is definitely full of potential. When first I heard of the basic plot, I thought to myself: ""wow, that's an exciting idea! It does seem a little far-fetched, but a truly talented writer and director can produce a great movie out of pretty much any concept."" The basic storyline is that Bond must stop a corrupted media mogul from engineering world events to start World War III. I was excited to see it! I'm figured: ""this film is going to be awesome! Right?"" Wrong! Once again, we have a decent plot concept that has been ruined by poor writing and direction. Seriously, that's really starting to aggravate me! That's one of the top 10 things I hate about bad movies, wasted potential. It's like the film makers were rushed at the last second to write and produce this ""film""! Why rush? You had a clever concept and you somehow ruined it. How is that possible?! There are a couple of scenes that I do like. The one when a group of henchmen are trying to break into Bond's car, but can't breach the security system. Also, like in most of the other Bond films, I enjoy the scenes with Q's briefings. Another thing, the storyline in this ""movie"" is easier to follow than ""GoldenEye"", but sadly, poor execution has marred any chance for it being a success. As for the acting in this ""film"", it's just as bad. Not quite as bad as in ""GoldenEye"", but it was still mediocre. The best performances come from Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, Michelle Yeoh as Colonel Wai Lin, Desmond Llewelyn as Q and Judi Dench as M. Every one else's acting performances are just standard to terrible. However, the best of the worst acting in this ""movie"" is from Jonathan Pryce as the main villain, Elliot Carver. Jonathan Pryce is a great actor and he has given great performances in other films. Therefore, he was one of the biggest standouts in this ""movie"". His performance as Elliot Carver was good, a little corny and a bit over the top at times, but otherwise decent. The soundtrack is nothing but a generic and boring mess. It's a shame, because composer David Arnold has written much better film scores. What happened here? I honestly can't recall a single note from this film score. That's the mark of a poorly composed movie soundtrack! Now for the only two positives, yes, there are indeed good things in this ""movie"". The sets/locations and the special effects were good. All of the sets/locations are nice and give the ""film"" a decent atmosphere. Finally, the special effects were well done and still hold up to this day. But, as I've said many times, good sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for a bad ""movie"". All of the other elements matter just as much! ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is just an embarrassment in the James Bond franchise. It is slightly better than ""GoldenEye"", but it's still by my standards a bad movie. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this ""movie"", just watch ""The World is Not Enough"" (1999) and ""Die Another Day"" (2002). Those two are, by far, his best Bond films.

The stiffness is gone from his performance this time around, and he seems thoroughly at ease with both the action and the humor. While he still does not have much edge, he provides the polish and sophistication without the prissiness of Roger Moore.The villain: Jonathan Pryce's thinly veiled snarky rendition of a Rupert Murdoch-type media mogul fomenting wars and then beating his competition to the headlines is truly inspired.The women: Michelle Yeoh is one of the most enchanting of the Bond women. She is mature and sexy, able to hold her own with Bond and does not shy away from either comedic banter or action sequences. A truly memorable character who would be fascinating in a movie of her own. Teri Hatcher seems totally miscast as Pryce's wife and a former paramour of 007. She seems ill-at-ease and her role seems truncated, as if much was left on the cutting room floor.The film really knows what notes to hit. Brosnan is given ample opportunity to exert his rights on the Bond role and he does not let any pass him by. There is strong chemistry between the leads, exciting action sequences, a memorable villain and leading lady.

So under the great pulse of the director (the only decent thing about the film) we have a movie that has several bad things as a result of the script and the influence of the producers. We first see the imperative need to encourage female characters. This is James Bond and not Legally blond and thanks to this both Connery, Lazemby or Moore would vomit with Brosnan's Bond. We also have a villain who can barely make his wife happy. Although Jonathan Pryce is a great actor, the character is over-acted and all the power of him is implausible.

Michelle Yeoh is the reason to watch thefilm, and I'd highly suggest seeing some of her other films, such as ""Wing Chun"" or 'the Heroic Trio"" where she truly gets to show off her abilities.I liked the motorcycle scenes, but this movie did not make proper use of her talents.  When you see her fight off several men, while pretending to be standing demurely behind her man (making it look like he's doing the fighting).

143,David_Frames,I'm afraid its bad news...,3,14 March 2005,"By the numbers, join the dots, whatever euphemism you care to use, provided it means torridly pedestrian you can safely apply it to Brosnan's second Bond. The rationale was presumably that having re-established the character in the classic and it has to be said, mainly imaginary mode in which most post-modern remakes are forged (its the realisation of the clichés you see not the substance), then all that was required was the tried and trusted formula with a contemporary spin. In fact you can just see the original script with a post-it on the front reading ""just add jokes"". It could have been fairly interesting, after all you're sending up Murdoch for God's sake and there's a wealth of comment there surely but Brosnan era Bond scribes Pervis and Wade aren't exactly Swift and Heller and they're banking on the idea that you do more gaming than reading so you wouldn't really be interested in a satirical edge in any event. There's no attempt at a real story here or anything approaching real characterisation. The tone is pure panto - comedy Germans, mindless Bond Girls and a wretched performance from Johnathan Pyrce as Carver who has nothing to do except ham it up and embarrassingly trot out lines like ""Let the mayhem begin!"" and ""theres no news like bad news"". In short no-one, including Brosnan is required to do any more than would be necessary were they lending their voices to computer game characters. Everything about this instalment cries out old hat. Arnold's score is self-consciously Barry-eque but with none of the invention, in fact its more Austin Powers while Spottiswoode's rasion d'tre seems to be to pile on the action and hope that's enough. It isn't. Offensive product placement gives the producers the opportunity to up the budget and therefore the spectacle at the expense of everything else, the theme song is poor and worst of all the title, in a perfect mirror of the film it headlines, doesn't make any sense and is in fact a production error which went unchecked. The fact that when it was caught no-one considered changing it back to lies from Dies (presumbably because the latter sounded more hard edged and Bondish) tells you all you need to know about how much respect the filmmakers have for the audience. If they were in any other profession these people would be sacked for gross misconduct. Bad bad bad.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Pierce as James Bond the very suave, sophisticated and incredibly good looking spy and Michele Yeoh.  It was nice to see a Bond girl who could really fight, even better than Bond himself who seems to run away from trouble rather than Yeoh who seemed to attract it.  Teri Hatcher was a waste of space, it was a poor role, made worse because she was in it.  Jonathan Pryce was a great villain as the media mogul, was he based on anyone in particular?  I think So!  The product placement was a bit much, although i'm sure it provided most of the funding for the film.  Bonds gadgets were great but the story was a bit stupid.  I guess they are a little stuck for ideas since the Cold War ended.  Still it was fun to watch.",Tomorrow Never Dies
145,vailsy,"underrated, although the villain is very forgettable",7,18 November 2012,"This movie has a lot going for it.. unlike Brosnan's last two outings as Bond there are no rubbish cgi effects sequences and everything looks pretty realistic. This was also Brosnan in his prime, he looks as he did in Goldeneye before he became older and slightly heavier Michelle Yeoh is also absolutely brilliant (as usual), and could quite capably take on the movie herself. This is before she went on to star in Crouching Tiger, and she looks gorgeous and very fit Teri Hatcher's character could've used more screen time as we never really learn much about her previous relations with Bond The one thing that spoils it is the villain who really is probably one of the worst Bond villains ever, some really cringe-worthy deliveries and overall a very forgettable performance.. normally it's a pity when the villains die, but when this guy got mangled I was overjoyed. If you were to take a great villain from a less good Bond movie, eg. Christopher Walken (View to a Kill), and put him in this it would be one of the best Bonds because it is otherwise very solid Overall Tomorrow Never Dies is a way above average Bond movie and deserves a higher rating. At 6.4 it rates as one of the worst Bonds which is just not the case, it's easily as good if not slightly better than The Living Daylights or For Your Eyes Only for example.

She does a lot of karate and steals the show as much as Brosnan.Elliot Carver, played by Jonathan Pryce, is a pretty decent villain. He is nowhere near as intimidating as some of the best Bond villains, but he is certainly passable. His goals were a little more realistic than most Bond villains.

The media angles makes a lot of sense these days. The locations work, especially Thailand.This film is up there with ""Moonraker"" as one of the most relentlessly action-packed entries in the series.

After the first twenty minutes it all goes downhill and the rest of the movie is too over reliant on action sequences(in particular the scene with Bond and the girl on the motorbike). Then there is Jonathan Pryce who hams it up as media baron Eliott Carver. There isn't even a good henchman and we as the audience have to settle for a pouty schoolboy named Stamper.

His latest idea is to create a war between the Chinese and the English (How's that gonna work? Their miles away? What they gonna do, fight in Australia?) Thus Bond is dispatched to find out what is going on and investigate Carver.What follows is one of the weakest Bond films of the bunch with a group of uninspired villainous characters who seem to be produced at the cliché factory. With such a feeble and uninspiring villain who seems relatively simple to beat and a henchman who is merely a tall thug, (Certainly nothing that Bond hasn't beaten before) it kills any real sense of tension and means that you just take in what happens without any sense of nervousness or worry that Bond could be in any serious danger. Even with a character like Bond you have to feel like there is some sense of danger, a feel that the threat is facing is somehow different this time, but here it just feel like Bond by the numbers.One of the other clear problems in this film is that many of the action set pieces feel like action set pieces, they don't fit into the film and merely feel like they have been thought up by a bunch of people who have been cooped in an office thinking ""What action set piece an we come up with to do this stunt?"" The script is weak and standard fare that compares to previous routine garbage like ""Man with the Golden Gun"" and the dreadful ""A view to a kill"", and although Pierce was arguably improving as Bond, it still meant that ""Goldeneye"" was the better Bond Film, even though his performance was not as measured as it is here.The score by David Arnold is instantly forgettable with little sense of the triumphant work on both ""Die Another Die"" and ""Casino Royale"" both of which seem to mark a distinctive turning point in his work, with a real sense of awareness of what is required, rather than the music by numbers we have here.Overall this leads to a film that is a mere filler for later and greater things for both Pierce and Bond.

152,C22Man,Flawed but enjoyable Bond outing,6,22 July 2015,"Bond Review. Title: Appropriately Bond and actually has meaning with the plot.Pre-Titles: Bond is sent to foil a terrorist market on the Soviet border with his MI6 superiors watching on. Before a Royal Navy launched missile hits the area he escapes with one of the planes. This is an extremely exciting opening with some really dynamic action. It's always fun to see Bond fight, while the stunt work is great and there is a genuine tension as to whether he'll escape.Theme Song: Sheryl Crow does an okay job with the theme, but it's the arrangement that makes it great. Crow's rough vocals aren't anything special, yet the composition feels like classic Bond with a rockier edge that works well. The instrumentation is really impressive and even the lyrics are catchy.Plot: Media mogul Elliot Carver wants global media coverage and plants to create war between Britain and China at sea to achieve it. Bond is sent to find out what his scheme is and races against the clock to stop it. The story is very far-fetched, but in fairness it is something different. Carver's plot is much more contemporary than many other Bond plots and it's nice to see a villain with different motivations. With that said it's hard to believe in such a crazy plan, things get a little too complicated and it is difficult to see what Carver would really gain from creating another World War.James Bond: Pierce Brosnan is at his most comfortable in the role here. He's really charming and likable as he's enjoying himself, but he also has a more ruthless edge here that adds intensity to certain scenes. He looks the part and handles the more light-hearted material fine, with only some poor dialogue letting him down.Bond Girls: Michelle Yeoh does a solid job as Bond's Chinese counterpart Wai Lin. It's nice to have a tough Bond girl and Yeoh is an enjoyable presence, but there isn't much chemistry with Brosnan and the character is never developed. Teri Hatcher is dull as Bond's old flame Paris. It's an interesting character, but Hatcher looks bored with the material and the role should have been done better.Villains: Jonathan Pryce is hamming it up as Carver and normally I wouldn't mind, but with such a grounded villain it doesn't work. All of the dialogue is corny which doesn't help, Pryce goes over-the-top whenever he gets the chance and he never seems to be a threat. If he was more subtle and menacing then it would have worked much better. Gotz Otto is decent as the towering henchman Stamper, but it's just another Red Grant knock-off. He's a good physical threat and looks intimidating, but he's just really boring and has no exciting traits.Support: Joe Don Baker returns as CIA agent Jack Wade and is enjoyable once again bring some warm humour. Judi Dench also puts in another solid performance as M, continuing to add layers to Bond's stern boss.Action: The action looks great, but is hit and miss. While in Hamburg we get a fight in a paper factory that is exciting and intense. We also get a car chase in a parking lot featuring a remote controlled BMW, this is an entertaining piece and has a unique edge. There a motorbike chase with a helicopter that is ridiculous but good fun and features some great stunt work. We get a few cool fist- fights throughout too. The climax on Carver's ship is a bit of a mess however. It's just a massive shootout with explosions and bodies flying everywhere, while neither villain puts up much of a fight.Score: David Arnold provides an excellent score. It has a sound that calls back to the original John Barry scores, while many compositions are packed with energy and bring a real drive or subtly to the appropriate scenes. The closing song by k.d. Lang is fantastic too.Production Values: Visually the film is very impressive and is one of the slickest looking films of the series. Everything looks high- tech without being excessive, as both the action and dialogue driven scenes are shot very well. The stunt work is truly spectacular at times and there is an excitement to the film that can't be denied. The writing is the biggest stumbling block and this is very much a film of two halves. The first half up until Bond leaves Hamburg is fantastic, everything flows well and it feels like we're getting a classic Bond. The second half in China is just dull, nothing interesting really happens and the pace gets painfully slow. Many of the characters are set-up nicely and could have been really interesting, but there isn't much development or smart dialogue for them. Hamburg makes for an attractive and glamorous location, but China isn't utilised all that well.Conclusion: When it's all said and done Tomorrow Never Dies is a thoroughly entertaining entry to the series. The issue I have are mainly to do with the writing. The potential for a truly great Bond film is here, but the characters are done wrong, the story is too illogical and there's a lot of inconsistency in the pacing. It has its good points with Brosnan being solid, some outstanding action and a wonderful score. But the weak villain, iffy Bond girls and that dull second half harm it. There also is a little too much trying to blend the realistic with the absurd that doesn't quite work. Yet the good aspects are really good and this is an entry that is frequently easy to enjoy.",Tomorrow Never Dies
153,movieman-200,What to do when you wish this tomorrow would just die,5,12 June 2005,"Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) is Pierce Brosnon's second outing as James Bond and the least memorable film in his tenure. Bond is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a British vessel in Chinese waters. Along the way he comes in contact with egotistical media baron, Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), whose empire of satellite and cable networks cover the globe  everywhere except China. Carver has decided that he will exploit his communications apparatus to launch WWIII  just because he can. In the meantime, aware that the British ship contains valuable cargo, China dispatches its own undercover agent, Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) to Hong Kong where she and Bond find themselves increasingly becoming the subjects of a murder plot. The film's narrative is somewhat complicated, though only superficially, when Bond realizes that his old love, Paris (Teri Hatcher) is married to Carver. The cast also include Ricky Jay and Gotz Otto as a pair of sadistic Carver stooges: the sycophant Henry Gupta and muscle bound menace, Stamper.Despite a fairly cut and dry story, director Roger Spottiswoode really doesn't know what to make of the material he's been given. The first half plays more like a downgraded and retrofitted knock off of Se7en, with Bond investing far too much time in sneaking under Carver's radar and getting reacquainted with Paris. The latter half is more on par with the expectations of a Bond action/adventure. Yet, despite an adrenaline pumping motorcycle/copter chase the rest of the film's action sequences only come to life in fits and sparks. And then there is the issue of Lin herself; she's a Bond girl only in definition; meaning she's female and she's working with Bond. But there's no sexual chemistry. Worse, Lin seems to take over for Bond on more than one occasion, leaving one with the question  is this a Kung-Fu flick with Caucasian testosterone thrown in on the side? There are no less than three versions of Tomorrow Never Dies floating around the marketplace;the MGM bare bones/movie only, the deluxe silver cased special edition that came out shortly thereafter, and a repackaged Bond Collection edition that contains most of the Special edition's special features.Transfer wise  MGM has reissued the same transfer for these three separate occasions. It is anamorphic widescreen, with a sharp and pleasing visual characteristic. Colors are rich and saturated. Blacks are generally solid and deep. Whites are pristine. There is a definite grain structure to this film that is stylistic on the part of film makers, but on the whole works against the grain of smooth and slick film making that one has come to expect from the Bond franchise. Fine details are fully realized throughout. Minor edge enhancement does not distract from the presentation. The audio is 5.1 surround and very much an exercise for the bass of one's speakers.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Here is Pierce Brosnan in his second outing as Commander Bond. The villain, Jonathan Pryce, is menacing in his scheme to start WWIII but pretty freakin' lame otherwise. His henchman wasn't much, either. But the action was great and Pierce has definitely molded himself into this character. Was weird seeing him in GoldenEye before this, but now quite comfortable in TND. Back is a great score, too, after the disaster in GoldenEye. That barely had the Bond theme but here it is included as much as it should be included (more than once) and we have a musical score that hearkens back to splendid past scores of the great John Barry.

I just couldn't take Jonathan Pryce seriously as a villain for one second.

A megalomaniac villain, an internet age and a Bond girl in the form of a Chinese Secret Service Agent!Elliott Carver is a crazed media mogul. Craving power so much that he is willingly to make the UK and China go to war just so that he ends up with exclusive coverage for his newspaper Tomorrow before anyone is even aware of this disastrous event taking place. Of course Bond must stop Carver before he starts World War III.Tomorrow Never Dies is a weaker film than Goldeneye. Its plot is far-fetched yet entertaining because of how silly the film is. Yet I could not help but lap up every second. Tomorrow Never Dies may have its flaws, but it is an enticing proposal. Even if the Bond girl spouts dialogue that would turn heads due to confusement in a Hit-man movie. Yet Tomorrow Never Dies' problems stop here.Pierce Brosnan is firmly set in the role of James Bond by his second instalment as the title character. I cannot remember it being this easy for Sean Connery and Roger Moore, do you? Embracing the role with enthusiasm and the appropriate amount of swagger, Pierce Brosnan is what elevates Tomorrow Never Dies from merely being a competent action film to the thrilling extravaganza that it is.Tomorrow Never Dies has no time to slow down. It has only two speeds, fast and faster. Yet the film is not tiresome and the action sequences rank among 007's greatest. The secondary Bond girl is a better fit for the film. Paris Carver is wife to Elliott and Bond's former lover. She asks questions that we all wonder and it's interesting to see a previous lover come back into the fold and give her views. ""Did I get too close for comfort?"" ""Yes"" Bond replies. We begin to realise from this point onwards that she actually meant something to Bond and that is all too rare.Jonathan Pryce may ham up the evil side of Elliott Carver by quite a large amount, but his performance is ""delicious"" all the same. It brings back fond memories of the early days of Bond, when you could not wait for the villain to go up against Bond in the climax. The same principle applies here maybe even more so because of the eagerness that Pryce brings to the role. It is like all he ever wanted to be is a Bond villain. His wish is granted.Finally, we have someone worthy as a replacement for John Barry; David Arnold. He manages to offer a blend of themes old and new, bringing an up to date feel for the well known and loved Bond theme.Tomorrow Never Dies is an amalgamation of everything I love and crave for from a Bond film.

The women were both stunning and were not denied some character development of their own (as is the case in many other Bonds).The gadgets delivered by Q and the gadgets in Lin's secret office in China were extremely impressive - including that magnificent 7-series BMW.But probably the stand out aspect of this Bond, above all others, were the terrific comedy and double entendre. After all, this was the film that gave rise to the now often used ""cunning linguist."" But there were many others that were absolutely hilarious - including ""I'm brushing up on a little Danish"", ""I've always been a fan of Chinese technology"" and Bond returning his car to Avis.That said, the film did not get bogged down in the comedy. Furthermore, it didn't get bogged down in boring, drawn-out plot divergences that other Bonds (especially the older ones) tend to do. It was thrilling and engaging from start to finish and avoid the boring periods that crop up in other bond films.

The sinking of the British warship with the ""eating"" torpedo is such a poor example of FX that the scale model used resembles a 7 year old1s first attempt at building a model. The missle armed BMW is yet another laughable ""product placement"" item the automaker paid big bucks for the producers to include in this film. Bond is supposed to be Bond.

He is an absolute joke as Bond, and a complete insult to the franchise. I would give this abortion a ""zero"" rating, but since one star is the lowest rating, I have to go with that.

Bond must stop Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) from generating a fictitious war through his media empire in order to make a killing on stock prices in weapons. For help, he finds Wai Lin (Michelle Yeah) to stop this nefarious plot. Along the way, we have good chases, great gadgets, and Teri Hatcher. This one has it all. There are two great Bond women who bring out strength and sexiness. Also are gadgets that are not over the top. Another strength is Brosnan who hits his stride as someone who combines the suave, sexy, and sophisticated agent with the ruthless assassin he is. What I really liked about this one was that Bond has a very interesting nemesis. Instead of a megalomaniac, we have a media mogul who wants to control all the information in order to propagate a false war. He does this to get rich.

162,emfern13,The Best Bond Movie,10,26 October 2001,This is the best Bond movie ever made. I like this one because it has a lot of action and both Bond girls are very sexy in the movie. The movie came out around the time that Titanic did and it did not do that bad it made over 100M. This movie is the second best movie of 1997 and it is number 17 on my top 100 films.,Tomorrow Never Dies
163,emfern13,Best Bond Movie with Pierce Brosnan,10,5 December 2002,"I had written a review earlier saying it was the best Bond Movie but I should have said with Pierce Brosnan in it. This is by far the best of his Bond movies. Most People think Goldeneye is the best because of its more complex plot. I think that may have made a problem because the movie was very slow paced in areas. Tomorrow has a much more simple plot and it has two great Bond Girls. Teri Hatcher who plays Bonds ex-girlfriend is extremely sexy. Michelle Yeoh who plays Wai Lin is not as sexy as Teri hatcher but she is a lethal bitch (She is Bond's equal).Tommorow features some of the best action scenes and the best gadgets in a Bond Movie. Also, the best car since the Aston Martin in Goldfinger. Overall, TND is a well paced, well planned Bond movie and its Brosnan's best. The other two dont come close to it, well TWINE is very good and also well paced but D.A.D. is just a ripoff of I dont know how many classic Bond movies.",Tomorrow Never Dies
164,eamon-hennedy,Hugely enjoyable Bond escapade.,8,17 November 2003,"I happen to be one of the biggest fans of Pierce Brosnan's Bond films so it is a foregone conclusion as to my opinion of this film. It was the first Bond film I watched on the big screen and I love it, is is enjoyable, has many a great action sequence and Pierce Brosnan, in his second role as 007, shows a confidence in getting into the role. Like all of his Bond films (GoldenEye, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day), the writers here develop a more character development trait within the film's plot. Here we have the wife of the villain, Paris Carver, played by Teri Hatcher, be revealed to have been one of Bond's former girlfriends, a relationship that was quite intense. We gain an emotional insight into the character as wee see how much he loves her by offering to protect her, but alas she is killed by her husband, Elliot Carver (played with wonderful relish by Jonathan Pryce), and we get an unusual emotional moment, something more akin to Bond's that are lesser considered in the public consciousness like Lazenby and Dalton. Here Brosnan can juggle many of the elements that we associate with Bond with a fantastic dash of style. We have ruthlessness, humor, humanity and an ice sense of cool that he really jumps upon. He is undeniably the heir to the throne of the best Bond on screen, and with him successfully continuing to play the character in two further films that were even stronger, he is, in my opinion, the best Bond there has ever been.Tomorrow Never Dies is not the best Bond film that Brosnan has done (that honor belongs to The World Is Not Enough), but like other 'second' Bond films like From Russia With Love and The Man With The Golden Gun, it is a hugely enjoyable action thriller mixing a fun, if somewhat far fetched plot, with a great wealth of fun and entertainment, as well as some of the silliest, but funniest, puns to grace the screen. Making this tasty cake even more so is Jonathan Pryce's villain, Elliot Carver. Pryce, one of the best actors to come from Britain, is one of those maniacally over the top villains that ends up becoming so much fun you end up liking him. Michelle Yeoh is a great Bond girl, setting in stone the foundations for later films that the Bond girl has to be equal to Bond himself. Her performance is charming and her chemistry with Brosnan great fun to watch. Teri Hatcher is good, I suppose, but then again her much hyped appearance in the film amounts to little more than a glorified cameo appearance that, while memorable, doesn't ensure her to be the Bond girl that she could have been.Featuring a fantastic music score from David Arnold (on a par with John Barry's work) and the most far fetched, but undeniably entertaining, car chase in recent years, this is undoubtedly one of the most fun Bond films that you will get a chance to enjoy. I loved it.",Tomorrow Never Dies
165,crowrobot,James Bond-Still saving the world after all these years,10,19 March 2005,"'Tomorrow Never Dies' is a superb Bond film, and if you're not looking for anything else, it provides some great entertainment.The story: Bond (Pierce Brosnan) has the save the world from a megalomaniac again, but this time, the threat is Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce, clearly having the time of his life), a worldwide media baron who wants to start a war in order to get higher ratings. All the Bond regulars are here: Q (Desmond Llewelyn), who gives Bond a new BMW complete with rocket launchers, machine guns, and a remote control (there's a fun chase sequence in a high-rise garage where Bond sits in the backseat and drives the car by remote); M (Judi Dench), still frosty and unamused with some of Bond's... questionable tactics; and Miss Moneypenny, who gets one of the best lines in the film.The Bond girl this time around is Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), a Chinese agent who has also been sent to find out what Carver's up to. Lin and Bond team up in the last part of the film, and their chemistry is impeccable. Lin also gets to kick some butt, which is always fun to see.Overall, if you're looking for some good IL' action and adventure, you can't go wrong with James Bond. 10/10",Tomorrow Never Dies

Sounds like a pretty good Bond film to me.A great Brosnan vehicle, 'Tomorrow' set the tone for the sequels to come, more so than Goldeneye. The producing team at Ion was set after Cubby Brocoli's passing, the unofficial heir to John Barry's throne was found in David Arnold, and the rest of the pieces still fit today, from opening titles to production design.Brosnan was able to work a script tailored towards his style, and did it well. His 007 seamlessly assimilated the styles of those Bonds before him, yet made it all his own.The opening montage surprisingly surpassed that of Goldeneye's, standing as one of the best in the series, and set a pace that the following sequels have closely imitated.Storywise, it's nothing we haven't seen before, but brought all together, it makes for a great Bond vehicle, and perhaps Brosnan's best Bond work as a whole. As is true with many of the better Bond films, the 'I guess that really could happen' quality is ever present.Not quite as epic as it's predecessor in scope, definitely up there in popcorn movie Bond lore.",Tomorrow Never Dies
167,Mario64,The best Bond flick of the last 10 years.,7,30 July 2001,"Even though we haven't seen a great Bond movie on the lever of Goldfinger or For Your Eyes only in recent times, Tomorrow Never Dies is enjoyable as the best one to come up in the last 10 years. It's the funnest of the last 3 Bond movies, with a motorcycle chase that ranks up as one of the greatest Bond action scenes ever. The villian is one of the most origonal we have seen in a while, a media tycone who wants to start a war and use it to his benefit. It does have a few minuses as do most movies, it seems a little darker than most Bond films and it has a few weak plot aspects. I'm still waiting for the next great Bond movie and perhaps it will never come, but this is enjoyable never the less.",Tomorrow Never Dies
168,freewillyfan,Tomorrow Never Dies,7,1 November 2019,Tomorrow Never Dies is the second Pierce Brosnan Bond film and is a step down from his first film. Brosnan is good in the film and there are some/exciting action scenes. The Bond girl was quite good I thought. The villain and his plan was not too interesting. Parts of the movie felt more campy compared to what was done in the previous film which was a bit of a let down. Still there was enough in the film to enjoy.6.8/10,Tomorrow Never Dies
169,Ripe Peach,Anachronistic tripe,1,29 October 2001,"Well, here we are thirty five years after the first Bond film, and not a lot has changed.  The ""baddies"" are still pantomime, the FX are sadly substandard, the ""real"" military hardware and combat situations remain resolutely fantastical, and the ""fantastical"" weapons remain farcical.  The acting and pacing are erratic, the dialogue cringeworthy, and the plot could be written on the back of an envelope.  The action scenes in particular are handled badly in this film, lacking any genuine urgency.Tomorrow Never Dies even complies utterly with the modern Bond conventions. Bond speaks eighty seven languages (seemingly), and the Bond girls are condescendingly allowed to be fairly competent.A few things have changed though.  You can't be having anything getting in the way of the FX, so Brosnan and Hatcher are utterly anondyne, lacking any kind of prescence or sparkle.  They have great faces for TV, but are well out of their depth on a big screen.  At one point, Bond pretends to be a banker; ironic, as he looks like an office drone rather than a super-agent. Surprisingly, Michelle Yeoh has both acting talent and physical prowess, avoiding the usual embarassing spectacle of stuntmen leaping head first into the furniture whenever a spindly, awkward mock-tough bimbo waves a well manicured fingernail at them.The biggest problem with Tomorrow Never Dies is that it was released post Austin Powers.   Bond can no longer just slay anonymous henchmen without the audience going ""Heyyyyy...!""  This is an old fashioned film struggling to find a niche in a modern world.",Tomorrow Never Dies
170,TimBoHannon,Let the Mayhem Begin!,10,25 April 2007,"With James Bond firmly re-established after the success of ""GoldenEye,"" the producers bust the door open in grand fashion with the next installment. The result is a tight, classy, explosive film that is definitely one of the series strongest. Never before has a Bond effort been so efficient, the hallmark of great modern action. Never before has the villain been as good, either.That man is Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), the world's most powerful media baron. Carver is a megalomaniac, but the difference is the film's reliance on powerful characterization, not outlandish schemes, to define him. Constantly making pompous self-references, at one point comparing himself Caesar, Napoleon and God; Carver is so full of himself his ego juice evaporates from his every pore. ""The difference between genius and insanity is measured only by success,"" he declares. He enjoys punctuating his sentences with unusual adjectives like ""delicious"" or ""outstanding,"" words that describe the movie well.Some Bond fans have taken up arms over the speed of the film, asserting it goes too far. What they forget is the way Bond's popularity fell in the 80s at the hands of superior competition, not to mention how quickly he was forgotten in the early 90s. Changes needed to be made in order for Bond to survive in a new era. In the end, he is more exciting than ever, despite complaints about the changes, which began in the Dalton era anyway and are more superficial than the outcry suggests.True, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is kinetic, but it never forgets its characters or neglects the story. It maintains its pace yet still creates and develops interesting people, which has not consistently been a strength of the franchise in the past. The two preceding films did a superb job with their characters, but this one manages to top even them. The plot is in fact unusually intricate for a Bond movie, or any action film. It is well fleshed out and clearly explained, so the diligent viewer will not have any trouble following it. Both changes are most refreshing.The story involves ascending tensions between Britain and China, beginning with the sinking of an English battleship in the South China Sea. The captain gives his final position in international waters, and M (Judi Dench), the head of British intelligence, soon suspects that Carver deliberately led the ship off course. While all doubt about the culprit's identity is quickly removed, the how and the why prove much more complicated. During Bond's investigation, he meets Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), a Chinese secret agent investigating Carver from the other end, and Paris (the lovely Teri Hatcher), a former mate and now Carver's wife.It is difficult to become involved in a Bond movie without an affinity for Bond, and Pierce Brosnan engenders that as well as anyone. After a very solid, but not exceptional debut, Brosnan now possesses all of the swagger, cool confidence, and toughness needed. He also continues his practice of making Bond more human, which leaves the character more likable than he often was in the past.A paramount element of any action thriller is the villain, and Jonathan Pryce's shoots a bullseye with every arrow. He understands Carver's complete amorality, and takes command of the role with fire and spirit. He deftly avoids making the mistake of taking his role too somberly, as he provides several chuckles for the audience with his captivating performance. That task is not an easy one. He combines his talents with those of writer Bruce Feirstein and director Roger Spottiswoode to create the splendid opponent for Agent 007.Götz Otto also leaves a lasting impression in his role as Stamper, Carver's muscular, psycho-blonde Chief of Security. Stamper becomes the most imposing henchman since Oddjob, and that is a powerful statement. Unlike many of Oddjob's successors, however, he is not invincible. Vincent Schiavelli also makes a brief appearance as a self-absorbed doctor of death in one of the film's best scenes.As for the Bond girls, Spottiswoode breaks the tradition of casting for skin only. Instead, he chooses one who is athletic; she can take care of herself almost as well as Bond can. Yeoh shows almost no skin, but leaves an indelible impression with her stunts and fight scenes.If the villain is not the most vital element in a Bond film, then the action is, and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" delivers in pure adrenaline. It has four major action segments starting with Bond's daring raid on a confused terrorist camp, an ingenious pursuit through a parking garage with Bond literally backseat driving his gadget laden BMW and an incredible motorcycle chase through Saigon.The fourth comes in the climactic battle as hundreds of bullets shred and sunder the interior of Carver's catamaran, not to mention more than a few bodies. This scene has shooting, dodging, running, diving, aiming, chaos, strategy, cover, and desperation abundantly. Legendary stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong's choreography is peerless and the set is covered so well that we feel like we are in the boat, covering the event like one of Carver's newsmen. Spottiswoode understands that the great directors do not try to be innovative, but let the quality of the production speak for itself. As in GoldenEye, the melees are bone crushing, but are photographed so the movie can maintain its PG-13 rating.Tomorrow Never Dies proves that after 35 years, Bond is still bona-fide entertainment, and far from ""brainless action."" If some of the naysayers have discouraged you from seeing this, cast aside your doubts and enjoy. After all, Gene Siskel gave it a thumbs-up not because of the action, not because of Brosnan, but because he liked the supporting characters, and that is only part of the fun.",Tomorrow Never Dies

The James Bond premise should have stopped at the last Roger Moore film. It would have died a dignified death.What came after was one bloody abortion after another. The premise went through the obligatory censorship dictated by the Political Correctness Gestapo (yes, I said it; let's see if IMDb has the courage to print it). Feminists had to be assuaged (what's this? Attractive, desirable women!? Oh, pass the smelling salts!). Bond is still allowed to drink Martinis, but give it time; I'm sure the pot pushers will will get into a moral twist and will demand it to stop. Hence, James Bond ceased to be the suave, cigarette-smoking, love-them-and-leave-them, sophisticated, charming-but-deadly character Ian Fleming meant him to be, to become the tedious, cardboard-stiff caricature that Dalton, Brosnan, and now Whatshisface Craig have been inflicting on us.I won't go through TND's flaws others have so accurately described.

172,Magenta_Bob,"You always were a cunning linguist, James",7,29 July 2012,"It's funny how the Brosnan Bond films, which I thought were genuinely cool when they were released, now kind of feel more dated than the ones with Sean Connery that were made more than 30 years earlier. That being said, Tomorrow Never Dies passes the time, despite containing some of the worst dialogue and/or puns the franchise put out pre-Die Another Day.After a rather badass opening sequence and a top-tier theme song by Sheryl Crow, this is basically the average bond fare, although the plot, where an unusually megalomaniacal media mogul, played by the ludicrously cartoonish Jonathan Pryce, aided by his unusually bland henchman Mr. Stamper (Götz Otto) is trying to start a new world war so that he can get exclusive TV rights in China, or something, makes me longing for the old Spectre days.If the plot and the sometimes poor writing drag the film down, the excellent set pieces keep it at a reasonable high level. Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), who is one of the coolest female characters in a Bond film, provides a really good martial arts fight scene, and there is an exhilarating motorcycle sequence that belongs to the top chases in the series. Bond's remote car gadget is also put to great use in an extended garage segment.

It´s your turn, 007...I must admit, when I watched ""Tomorrow never dies"" the first time I was a little disappointed. The whole time of the movie I thought about ""Goldeneye"". At that time, the action scenes were a little predictable to me - maybe because I had already seen the best scenes in the trailer. But that was 3 years ago! Recently I watched it again and with another attitude. I think I´ve got to change my opinion now! There is  still one thing that bothers me. Maybe because the atmosphere was a little different - I don´t know, but it felt strange at first. But fact is that Michelle Yeoh steals the show!

178,Theflyace,Bond Month #18: James Bond vs. Rupert Murdoch and Fox News,7,23 October 2013,"After GoldenEye modernized Bond for the new age of cinema-goers, the producers and writers sought to take it in a similar direction by taking the issue of the dominance of media in the world and applying it to a nuclear war. Tomorrow Never Dies is one of those Bond films that really shouldn't work on paper, but somehow does in grand fashion.Well like I said above, the story involves a incident between the British and the Chinese, orchestrated by news mogul Elliot Carver (played by the always great Jonathan Pryce) He seeks world domination, media world domination. he seeks to start a war by twisting the facts and covering every single detail. It's basically Rupert Murdoch and Fox News doing what they are already doing today. Bond of course has to prove that it was all a huge mistake and that Carver is really the one behind the impending attack.Brosnan is once again great as Bond, giving us the thrills and something I now call suave humor. When he drives a car off a roof onto the street, he does so like he has created the perfect dinner dish, with a ""pieste resistance"" sort of expression. He's so good.But the two Bond girls is this aren't so much. Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin is a bit more interesting than Teri Hatcher as Paris Carver, but both seem bland and not very well executed. Don't get me wrong, they're fine actresses and they get some good moments, but overall, you won't see me gushing over them anytime soon.Once again, the filmmakers were very smart for not going towards an over-the-top villain and and equally out of this world plot, it seems actually very plausible that such an plan could be successful, especially that people today rely very heavily on yellow journalism and blind reporting. With this said, Elliot Carver is easily one of my top favorite Bond villains, because he is so deliciously driven and camera-hungry that he would kill millions of people for the front page rights.The action scenes are very well devised, getting a motorcycle chase for I think the first time in the Bond movies, and it is exciting. But the action is relatively muted until the very end on the stealth ship.A lot of people see Tomorrow Never Dies as a weak Bond film, but I think its sort of misunderstood. It has some glaring flaws in the story and the climax, but overall, it's an enjoyable piece of escapist entertainment.

It's also a very exotic movie, with the Asian environments and the actress Michelle Yeoh, this time introducing the new style of fights with the martial arts (again, this is a pre-matrix action movie). Apart from that there is a lot of gunshots, many explosions (they are cool, the explosions) and lot's of chasing sequences (I mean lots, with vehicles or on foot). And the ending is like a roller coaster. Why it has so low vote? Jonathan Pryce. I am sorry, but this guy is not solid as a villain.

186,DaRick89,Not brilliant Bond but decent nonetheless,6,21 November 2018,"Tomorrow Never Dies is a perfectly decent film, but it never touches anything resembling greatness. Indeed, it is probably my least favourite of the Brosnan Bond films.Part of the problem is that, like all Brosnan-era Bond films, it is weighed down by what I call the 'Bond plot structure', with a comparatively dull middle section following a spectacular beginning before the movie goes out with a bang.After said spectacular beginning, which involves Bond making a literally explosive entrance at a Russian arms fair, the plot examines the media's drive to achieve ratings and the lengths that they will go to achieve them. While said plot is not necessarily original (media outlets engineering war for ratings does have historical precedent), it is very topical and generally executed in a fairly competent manner.However, there are a few issues. For example, unlike in other Bond films there are no plot twists and while there is some exposition (with Carver boasting of his past misdeeds at his party) there is not much character development. Bond having past off-screen romances is hardly a novel concept, while the media mogul - Carver - and his associates are obviously evil from the outset.As noted earlier the middle section is comparatively dull. Bond's attendance at Carver's party doesn't make for particularly compelling viewing, while the romance between Brosnan and Hatcher is completely forced and should have been written out completely. Luckily the film has enough sense to incorporate an amusing cameo from Schiavelli, Bond's escape from Carver's facility, a fairly exciting car chase and also a subsequent bike chase through the streets of Saigon. As such, this film flows better than The World Is Not Enough.Additionally, with the exception of Michelle Yeoh's character, the Chinese perspective regarding the incident is not explored in the film. It may have been better to remove the rote romantic elements and instead explore said perspective in a bid to elicit sympathy for or against the Chinese.There are also some plotholes. For instance, why Britain's admirals would think it was a good idea to start a war with China has me mystified, given that it was a great power even in 1997.The dialogue is sporadically amusing, with Bond's usual quips punctuating the film and providing levity in otherwise tense situations. The revelations that Stamper's henchmen engage in torture as a hobby are so ridiculous that they arouse amusement.The acting is a mixed bag. Brosnan is as assured and witty as ever, but he has no chemistry with Hatcher, who herself seems to be going through the motions. His interactions with Yeoh also frequently seem somewhat forced, with their romance being especially unconvincing. Yeoh does however, acquit herself well during the fight scenes and her combative character provides a point-of-difference to the usual stereotypical damsel-in-distress Bond Girl. Judi Dench plays a stereotypical stern authority figure, though she does display chemistry with Geoffrey Palmer during their acerbic interactions (not unlike in As Time Goes By).As for the villains, Pryce is eloquent and entertaining, but it is difficult to regard his cartoon character as a serious threat. However, he does contrast effectively with the more effective Gotz Otto, who besides being a real physical presence has the cold, malicious purposefulness which makes for a great villain. Ricky Jay is wasted - his tricks could have been used to good effect, but his character is instead a forgettable technician. Similarly, it is a shame that Schiavelli doesn't feature more because his cameo elicits genuine mirth.To summarise, Tomorrow Never Dies is competent, but its flawed and predictable plot, comparatively dull middle section and mixed performances prevent it from being anything more than that.3/5 stars",Tomorrow Never Dies
187,mkivtt,no plot Rambo IV,2,1 December 2000,"This movie gets off to a promising start, but after the initial 15 minutes it becomes lost in a loop of meaningless events, and after an hour one might wonder if it is still the same movie that one was watching at the start. The plot is totally abandoned and not returned to until the last 20 minutes, by which time the movie has also degenerated into what seems to be the Rambo IV script. Bond single-handedly wipes out hordes of opposing soldiers without even breaking a sweat, and of course saves the day.At no time during the movie is there any sympathy for Bond or the other characters, they are as flat as they can be. Terry Hatcher is incredibly miscast and really could not have done her poorly written role any worse. Brosnan is horrible as Bond, with an air of superiority and a super-human aura around him that simply makes you sick. Where has the human touch gone that Timothy Dalton gave Bond so well? It seems it vanished, along with any reality in the plot. Dalton failed and made mistakes often enough, but the Bond in this movie should have been called 'John Rambo' or 'Superman' instead. Truly a bad movie.",Tomorrow Never Dies
188,theskylabadventure,Brosnan's best Bond outing,8,6 January 2008,"Brosnan's hugely successful debut as James Bond, 'Goldeneye', ensured that audiences were left with little doubt that Bond could still hack it amid a seemingly endless slew of Hollywood action blockbusters. For me, despite some nauseating flaws, the follow up would be Pierce Brosnan's finest moment in the guise of Commander James Bond.There are a lot of arguments for and against this movie for me, and I'll no doubt spend more time criticising it than praising it in this review. For those of you that haven't seen it, at least this review will serve to prepare you for the bad but hopefully it will also convince you that it is certainly worth seeing.There are three major hang ups I have with 'Tomorrow Never Dies'. The first, and perhaps the biggest, is the premise. While it does actually unfurl nicely as a plot, it leaves us with no hope of suspending any disbelief which, for me at least, is what makes the Bond movies great. In a nutshell, some media mogul intends to manipulate world events in order to start World War Three between China and Britain. The problem is that, according to the film, the mogul in question, Elliot Carver, is supposed to be a household name.Unlikely as most of the Bond scenarios have always been, it was always possible that Hugo Drax was hoping to start a new super-race in outer space, that Max Zorin was planning to wipe out Silicone Valley or that Goldfinger was intending to destroy all the gold in Fort Knox. If the events that take place in most Bond movies were ever to really happen, Joe Public would never know about it anyway. The problem here is that we all know that Elliot Carver is a made up character because, were he not, we would all know who he is and we would all, apparently, be watching his channels and reading his papers. Minor gripe, perhaps, but it leaves the film with no credibility whatsoever.Elliot Carver is also the crux of my second big problem with the movie, or rather Jonathan Price's grotesquely camp performance of him. I'm not sure whether to blame Price or the director on this one but, every second this supposed supervillan is on screen, I want to throw a chair at it. He is just plain awful, and easily the worst Bond baddie next to John Gray's embarrassing turn as Blofeld in 'Diamonds Are Forever'.The third problem is that there is little to no chemistry between Bond and his Chinese love interest, played by Michelle Yeoh. They both try hard, and the scenes between them are handled fairly well by the director, but if the chemistry isn't there, what can you do? Sadly, simply, the chemistry is not there.There are other gripes I have, such as the absence of Bond veteran Peter Lamont as Production Designer. The nature of the plot led the film-makers to go in a rather predictable pseudo-techno futuristic direction. The subsequent lighting does make for some great cinematography, but it all makes the film seem like it's trying just a little too hard. Sadly, the franchise continued in this direction right until the thoroughly appalling 'Die Another Day' before realising that it didn't work any more.For all my beefing thus far, you might be forgiven for thinking that I don't like this movie at all. However, what this film has in spades, and what more than makes up for its shortcomings, is swagger. This film has a set of balls on it like a Spanish bull. Brosnan struts through every scene like he owns Hollywood, in what is certainly the pinnacle of 'his Bond'. The action sequences are spectacular, without exception, and David Arnold lives out his life-long fantasy by penning the finest of odes to John Barry, without ever over-indulging.Other nice touches here include a back-story concerning an old flame of Bond's, which gives a new insight into the character for the '90s. There are some good lines in here too, but there are some pretty bad ones to go with them, including a few in-jokes delivered by Moneypenny which are dead before they hit the back of cinema.Even with all of the problems, this film does come through gloriously and is largely one the most enjoyable Bond movies ever made, in a sort of mindless way. It is a film that certainly values style over substance but, when you have this much style and you know how to use it, who cares?",Tomorrow Never Dies
189,jordansepticeye,Style Over Substance Brings This Bond Film Slightly Down,9,11 December 2016,"I did like this movie,a lot,it's just a few flaws bring it down.First,the good,the social commentary about the media is very true and interesting.I like how the pre title sequence is from MI6's perspective and it is well done.The villains are delightfully over the top and entertaining,the villain's plan is very original even if it is a bit stupid.The Bond girls are really good and well acted.The action is fantastic,well choreographed with lots of variety.I love that one scene shows Bond's more emotional side.The bad,the main girl doesn't do much,and the biggest flaw is that the action outweighs the story by a landslide,yes the plot is simple,but a bigger emphasis on it would help.Tomorrow Never Dies has great villains and action,but a weak story.",Tomorrow Never Dies
190,Shinwa,More than adequate,6,27 November 1998,"I'm happy to report that Tomorrow Never Dies is the best Bond movie since For Your Eyes Only; I just wish that were a ringing endorsement. Certainly, it's an improvement on Goldeneye, which was a watch-checker of a movie if I ever saw one, and it at least distinguished itself from the films that came before. Props go to Michelle Yeoh, a ""Bond girl"" who's actually allowed to do something; Teri Hatcher, who actually manages to steal some scenes here; Jonathan Pryce, having a ball as the villain. It's a bit too teched up for its own good, but it keeps the action coming, and has a surprisingly hard edge in places which almost (almost!) make me forget the Roger Moore films ever existed. A step in the right direction.",Tomorrow Never Dies
191,shamsee,"Worst Bond Ever. If ""The World is Not Enough"" doesn't not improve, this movie will be responsible for Demise of James Bond.",1,11 October 1999,"One characteristic of James Bond movie is high intelligence of Bond himself. He is a man who is not Rambo and dose not want to become Rambo either. However,if he has no choice he ends up using gadgets and other tricks to get out of sticky situations.I don't know why but the idiots who made this and one of the Dalton Bond movie, where he goes after drug King pin, want to turn this sophisticated genius, into a mad killer hound.He is a spy, not leader of Delta force.Tomorrow Never Dies is one of the most brain dead movies ever made. It has so many technical flaws that the whole industry should be ashamed of this movie.The villain is a loser. Not cool evil guy we are used to, but a real loser. His grand plan to start a nuclear war so people will watch his show, has to be dumbest idea ever. As a matter of fact he wants nuclear attack on China, so Chinese will tune in. I guess when  they hear someone launched nukes on them, their first reaction will be to pop some pop-corn and start a party.As if rest of the news crews of the world will not be able to get to it for an year. How brain dead can one be.Also the guy who always plays the villain's body guard and is also a killer with no scruples, is played by another loser who talks too (not the characteristic of other guys in that role) much is worse than the main villain.In James Bond movie the focus has always also been on art. I went in expecting that since Bond has gone to China, there will be thrilling sequences on the great Wall. Or there will be a hide and seek and hunt sequence in those 1000s of statues on ""that"" excavation site, which will provide excellent background for such. How about some martial arts? Most of all, I expected introduction to Chinese market scene, and exciting food served like cat and snake ( dragon dish ). Nothing!!!!He just drove around some stupid market, jumping from one roof top to another. The sequence was so poor that it was laughable. Rambo II all of a sudden seemed believable and realistic after seeing this crap.Then while world is at risk of nuclear war, even though Bond is in position to get help,  he decides to pull another Rambo on us, and he goes alone. In all other Bond, if he can get help, he does, because his mission is bigger than his ego. Not in this crap.The final sequence of destruction is probably the dumbest action sequence ever. The nuclear blast occurs, and Bond and his girl hold their breath, and then afterwards they pop back up and sit on the nuclear pile. This is entertainment for brain dead. At one time, Bond fires a missile inside the sub to take out a guy. Aaaaaaarrrrrrrrhhhh!The only reason dumb critics gave it high rating was that the girl was given a bit more to do, and there is less sex. Therefore it would have been a political sin to call this crap, crap.Let's hope that ""The world is not enough"" has something in it for people with a brain.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Most fans would argue GoldenEye is the stronger of the two, but after watching this film I think Tomorrow Never Dies is better. The villain played by Jonathan Pryce is one of if not the most evil one there has ever been. Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin is strong and has great character, and Pierce Brosnan is fantastic in it. The action if strong, perhaps slightly weaker than GoldenEye, however the story of this is much better in my opinion.

194,marshall89,Perfect!,10,22 November 2002,"When I received every movie in the James Bond DVD collection (the one with seven movies) for my birthday except for The Man with The Golden Gun, there were three movies in the set that I hadn't seen. The first one I checked out was Tomorrow Never Dies, and I loved it. Our piece of trash DVD player kept freezing, but I managed to watch the whole thing to the end. The movie kicks off with Bond investigating a terrorist arms market somewhere in Russia and has to escape being blown up by a missile launched by a ship at sea. This scene is great, and after the cool animations and the pretty good theme song by Sheryl Crow, things really start to heat up. Media mogul Elliot Carver, played excellently by Jonathan Pryce, is bent on starting an entire news network that reports nothing but bad news. Carver is trying to get Britain and China to attack each other and start a new world war. All this is great, but there are a few disappointments. For one, I think Paris Carver should have been given more time in the movie. Her character could really have played a great part in the end. There also should have been another action scene or two sandwiched somewhere in the movie. However, this is a still great movie that I recommend. 4 stars out of 5.",Tomorrow Never Dies
195,amahlanand,Just Another Day in the life of James Bond,6,9 May 2012,"'Goldeneye' marked the dawn of a neo-Bond. Its follow up however has returned to a more formulaic Bond, not short of the regular constituents like gadgets, cars, stunts and thrills but neither Pierce Brosnan nor director Roger Spottiswoode have driven an elevation of James Bond to new heights, just as 'Goldeneye' did. The opening sequence for instance, which sets the tone for any Bond film, was not as groundbreaking as its predecessor. Dare I say I felt the two seemed quite similar. The ideas behind the film weren't at all bad, they just weren't exercised to potential. The patchiness though of the movie was its principal drawback, it was far from the most invigorating Bond story at the best of times although the premise behind it was reasonably original and Bond-worthy.Again, Pierce Brosnan shows why his perception of Bond is one of the best. Compared to his first shot at the coveted title, he was more cheeky, never without a cynical and sly comment and a touch more lighthearted. He retained the swagger and brashness as well as an admirable slickness. But then again, we've seen that all before, whether from him or even Sean Connery. All the same, even if he didn't add a great deal from Bond's last outing in 'Goldeneye', he has still made the James Bond persona his own.A Bond villain needs to be intimidating whether in demeanour or personality and Jonathon Pryce just did not fit the profile. He was very unthreatening on screen, a commercial villain in every sense of the world. But that's not to say his performance as Elliot Carver was poor. On the contrary, he performed exactly the role that was scripted, albeit the fact that his character was not formulated well. James Bond is not the only one who keeps eyes glued to the screen. The notorious Bond girls have the same responsibility although they probably wouldn't have been overly successful this time being bland, uninteresting and devoid of any really useful part. Being stunningly attractive was not the modus operandi for the casting directors it seems. Something which unfathomably kind of departs from Bond lore.There were lots of meaningless fireworks and times where even usually exciting Bond mayhem can be passed off nonchalantly if it is just too much or without purpose. It remains exciting, but not incredibly innovative and awe-inspiring",Tomorrow Never Dies

Bond then travels to China and with the help of Chinese agent Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), together they shall foil Carver's plans.The film isn't as super amazing as Goldeneye, but still manages to be truly one of the best Bond films ever.

The character development was good with carter and Michelle yeoh but was so-so with Teri hatcher. Michelle yeoh did well in this movie in that she was acting more like a spy/ government agent than a bond chic that just goes in bed at the drop of a dime. It was also cool to see the Chinese government's array of weapons and gadgets compared to Britain's(the fan was sweet). Of course Jame's bond's gadgets were creative as well as the BMW car scene (that was crazy). It was also a plus to bring back the original music but i had no problem with golden eyes music either. The story was good with a stealth boat and the radar concept. The problem i had is with the main villain/villains. Carter was insane sure, but a media guy? Not that impressive. Dr. Kaufman seemed like a interesting character who didn't seem to live up to his hype that he created for himself. No depth at all to his character. The other one is Teri hatcher, she had some history with bond but the movie didn't really go that much into it. You have to admit though, if you were carter and found out that an ex boyfriend just had your wife last night you'd probably kill her off too. I just wasn't expecting Teri hatcher to be axed off so quickly. Overall though, the movie was good, not to many low points of the movie.",Tomorrow Never Dies

And it also beats ""Die Another Day"", because everything was terrible about that Bond movie.  Other than that, this is one of the lowest entries in the series.I have several reasons why I dislike this Bond film, my primary reason being the bad guy.  Johnathan Pryce does the best with what he has, he would have made an excellent Bond villan if it weren't for his motivation; being the world's biggest and richest mass-media mogul.  I fondly look back on the old Bond films where the bad guys wanted to take over the world.  Now, the bad guys only want to broadcast the world being taken over...Neither of the Bond girls impressed me terribly, Hatcher's acting was stale, and Michelle Yeoh was the exact opposite of all other Bond girls (with the exception of Jinx, whom I dislike even more).  Most Bond girls are simply women, connected to the plot, who need help getting out of a bad situation. But apparently the new producers had to break tradition and start making the Bond girls tough in themselves.All in all, the only saving aspect of this movie was the opening action sequence, where Bond hijacks a nuclear missle, beating the bad guys around the whole way.",Tomorrow Never Dies

The photography is beautiful and the sequence is action packed, and the DTS 5.1 channel soundtrack is one of the best I've heard. Once the pre-title sequence is done and the opening credits roll, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" settles in and delivers 2 hours of good entertainment. As Bond battles media mogul Ted Turner.... Ahhm, I mean Elliot Carver (hey, if Jimmy Dean really played Hugh Heffner instead of Willard Whyte in ""Diamonds Are Forever"", then it is safe to say Elliot Carver is really Ted Turner and I kind of like that idea), he travels to Vietnam, Germany and lots of exotic locations. As for women, James tangles with Teri Hatcher, thankfully for only a brief amount of time... but the real Bondette is Michelle Yeoh and she is fabulous. Played as nearly an equal to James, (much the same as Jinx in Die Another Day), this film ranks in the upper 50% of Bond adventures.

Sheryl Crow is perfect for the slow, melodic theme song that ushers you in to the movie. The movie also has an innovative plot line relevant to the late 90s when newspapers were fed by satelite feed and internet - an upstart newspaper (Tomorrow) trying to make a name for itself and build a global empire goes rogue creating its own headline-grabbing news. The paper is run by Elliot Carver, a crazed megalomaniac unleashing disaster after disaster after writing the story. Like a Renaissance artist creating a new work, his fingers race across the keyboard in pecking style, using only one hand. We notice the obvious satire on real world journalism and chuckle. Jonathon Pryce as Carver thoroughly convinces us that Carver is insane and out of control. Terri Hatcher as his wife is also terrified of him, further convincing us that he is a menace. The main disaster unleashed was pretty much stock - a hybrid of naval ship sinking per The Spy Who Loved Me and missile recovery from underwater (Thunderball) with nominal variations. The supporting villains were pretty good but a bit cartoonish - the sadistic professor assassin and the dyed blond bouncer type recalling the Nazi Aryan stereotype. Overall, I found the movie quite entertaining and stable, but it is not for big thinkers. Really doubt Chinese intelligence would take MI6 on a tour of their gadgets development lab. More likely they helped fund the movie. Just a guess. Anyway, give your brain a rest on this one. Just make sure the popcorn is fresh and add plenty of butter and salt. Enjoy.",Tomorrow Never Dies
208,Mrswing,Best of the Brosnan Bonds - by far,8,27 December 2016,"Tomorrow Never Dies sort of repeats the You Only Live Twice story line, though with some notable differences. Brosnan is more relaxed in the role, though he's still not great with quips (though the quips and one-liners he has got as Bond have been abysmal on the whole, so it's not really his fault). Michelle Yeoh is the most robust Bond Girl ever, and the only one who's almost a match for Bond. She's far more competent than Barbara Bach's agent XXX, for instance. Of course, Yeoh isn't a sex pot so the relationship is far less sexual than ever before. Teri Hatcher is forgettable as the other Bond love interest, and she's the one participating in the ongoing weakening of Bond which started with Brosnan's arrival: here, he was afraid when things got serious between them and ran away. Yeah, right. Luckily, there's no character arc where Bond has to overcome yet another psychological trauma this time. Jonathan Pryce is a brilliant actor, and throws himself in the part of evil media mogul Elliot Carver (who was based more on leftist/spy Robert Maxwell than on right-wing fiend Rupert Murdoch). However, Carver isn't really a strong enough opponent for Bond. Perhaps the movie would have worked even better if a Chinese general had been the main villain and Carver the secondary bad guy. Anyway, the action is top notch, with a great teaser, a fun back seat car chase filled with gadgets, a great motorcycle chase (gadget-free) in Vietnam, and a very lengthy and protracted final battle aboard Carver's stealth ship. I would have preferred Bond and Wai Lin to have had a squad of military support (a Bond movie should end like a war movie to be really successful), but they perform like a two-person army anyway. Brosnan kept getting better as Bond - unfortunately the movies got worse, with World Is Not Enough being a garbled mess and Die Another Day going so ridiculously over the top it became painful to watch.",Tomorrow Never Dies

212,Clockwork-Avacado,Possibly the worst Bond ever??,1,11 September 2012,"Having decided to watch the entire series in time for the fiftieth anniversary this year, I managed to get this far before giving up. ""The World is not enough""may be the best Bond yet, but if it's anything like this, then I've made a wise decision. Okay, Brosnan is probably the poorest actor to play Bond, but he's a lot more Bondian than Craig's pseudo-American tough guy type.I did actually like ""Goldeneye"" a lot. But this is just wrong. Jonathan Pryce is truly abominable, camping his way through a two dimensional character, and the less said about his muscleman helper, Stamper, the better. I know this is a film about technology and the threat of an Orwellian future is hinted at with Carver's ""global Empire"", but we're bombarded by trendy gadget after gadget, and Bond is no longer a human being, he's just some guy playing one big video game. By this point, the series has lost the humanity, which used to combine well with the gadgets, and create a great storyline. Instead, mindless action sequences fill the screen, and are quite frankly pathetic in their attempts to create ""drama"". My only praise for this movie is for Teri Hatcher as Paris Carver, and in the few minutes she is actually on screen, we get a look beyond Bond's pursed lips and his cocky smile. Shame she's killed off so quickly. Also, despite some terrible editing, the pre-credits sequence isn't too bad, although M's sniping gets irritating.( ""At least I don't think with them..."" Do me a favour...) So for me, anyway, ""GoldenEye"" is the last Bond worth watching, light years ahead of LTK, and TND is to be avoided at all costs. And in case you're wondering, my idea of a great Bond movie is OHMSS",Tomorrow Never Dies
213,d-apergis,A missed opportunity,7,30 December 2009,"For the first half of its length this is a terrific Bond movie: fast, funny, clever, exciting, glamorous and full of intrigue to keep everyone happy. Moreover, its commentary on the power of media and its abuse of public consciousness is cunningly and caustically composed, played like an Oliver Stone conspiracy theory. And then, in a sloppy and perfunctory second half set in Vietnam, the whole falls apart with indignity. Direction becomes discomfited, the script is written on foot, the action succumbs to horrid slo-mo and dull martial arts derring-do, and Bond himself gets to deliver some of the worst one-liners in the series. A missed opportunity.",Tomorrow Never Dies
214,ADAM-53,"Weak, weak, weak!",1,29 November 1998,"The worst scripted Bond film of all time, and with the lamest Bond. Pierce Brosnan is utterly unable to carry off this part and proves for a second time that he should have stuck to the ""disease and madman of the week"" US TV movies he was doing before landing the Bond role. This movie reportedly cost 100million US dollars to make. On what was it spent? The only decent thing about it is David Arnold's music score. This is, quite literally, a film for which somebody forgot to write the middle section. It's got an OK-ish opening, then cuts immediately to the end. Wait a minute -- everyone knows Bond had an affair with Teri Hatcher's character, so he can just go and find out what he needs to know from her! What a good idea! Why bother having a movie at all? One of the key elements that defined the Bonds was the way in which the ""investigation"" lended plausibility to the story; it helped us suspend disbelief. In GoldenEye it was lacking, in this it just never happened at all. I've seen all the Bonds on the big screen, and I've read all of Fleming's Bond books many times. All I can say is that whoever was responsible for this has obviously decided that Bond should become a weekly 1hour TV show, because that is what the last two efforts have looked like. Neither of them have the grand sweep, the sense of going to interesting places and showing interesting things, that characterised the photography and helped dramatise the earlier Bonds. In the Brosnan Bonds, the world has truly become a small and dull place. The whole plot of TND takes place over about 48 hours and he travels around the world in that time -- and no stopping for customs officials! Maybe 007 should now become a costume-period drama, set in the 1950s and 60s, where he truly belongs, while new action-men, Rambo-like robots who can kill whole armies unassisted, become the norm: because that is what 007 has become and it strikes me that in the transition something key has been lost -- the ability of the audience to identify with him.",Tomorrow Never Dies
215,chancey-23,"An OK Bond film, nothing special",6,15 July 2012,"Coming off of GoldenEye, one of the best Bond films, Pierce Brosnan's second film is nothing close to that film. The film's action is pretty good, the plot is all right, but it just has those dumb little moments here and there that just don't sit well with me. The best part of the film, by far, is Jonathan Pryce as the villain. Not only is he intimidating, well, when he's not faking karate, that is, but he has the acting ability as well, which as I mentioned in my Goldfinger review, is what ever good Bond villain needs. Aside from all of that, the film is extremely talkative and at times very slow paced, the worst being a party scene which seems to go on for about twenty minutes and also a scene where an assassin goes to take Bond out but talks to him forever. There is nothing I hate more in a Bond film when the film does this, but I do forgive it for Jonathan Pryce's performance and those action scenes.",Tomorrow Never Dies

217,BrohmaBull007,A Run and Gun Movie........... and Nothing More,7,29 January 2006,"This is a good movie and all but this isn't a James Bond like movie. You take a war plot....... with an Sylvester Stallone gun fights and you just add bond into it. Brosnan does a good job here.......... you cant notice his age and he doesn't shove the one liners down our throats like Moore. I think the bad parts of this movie were the useless henchman who gets little buildup and doesn't do anything but stand around and look tough. I hated this air thin plot because the main villain completely destroys it. The villain should do something evil or have a nice background and buildup but this villain is just irritating and boring. Michelle Yeoh is OK here but you can tell that she doesn't have any chemistry with Brosnan and you barely know what shes doing. I enjoyed the remote control car sequences (including the hilarious part with Q). The best part was the the car chase with Bond using the remote control to drive. I was a little surprised at how they changed Bond to using machine guns and killing people without a heart or hesitation. The theme song was good as were some of the action scenes, It just doesn't feel like a Bond film.",Tomorrow Never Dies
218,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,"Brosnan's best, even though that's not saying much (SPOILERS)",7,5 January 2005,"""GoldenEye"" proved that James Bond could not only survive the Cold War, but can be updated for the current generation (Even though I personally feel this reinvention is unnecessary). So for the next film, originally called ""Tomorrow Never Lies"", producers decided that they would continue down the path paved by Pierce Brosnan's first outing, amplify it, and add more Roger Moore innuendos. While this worked for his second film, later titled ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and the next one, it all culminated in the disaster known as ""Die Another Day"".Many critics have slammed ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" for having too many one-liners, too much action, and for being an all together bad film. True, while some lines are cheesy, there are some definite witty ones. The motorcycle chase, the kung fu fights, and the ending (which is far too clichéd) are pretty bloated, but everything else works fine. And the movie has an infectious energy to it, especially the early scenes, and even though it doesn't have the flair of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", it's first and foremost a Bond film.The movie puts a nice spin on the ""madman plans to gain power by any means necessary"" plot line and combines it with the ""start WWIII between two countries"" idea first used in ""You Only Live Twice"". Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) is a wealthy, but obviously insane, media baron. He has the power to reach any one on the Earth, except China, who has refused him broadcast rights. To get to the Chinese, he sends a British ship, the HMS Devonshire, off course into Chinese Territorial Waters. Carver's stealth ship then sinks the Devonshire and destroys one of the two MIG's that were circling 'round the ship.Bond is sent in, and after poking around, naturally finds out that Carver was behind the attack and tries to stop the villain's next move, which is to launch a missile into Beijing, killing foreign heads-of-state, which would in turn guarantee a huge war. Then an ally of Carver would take power of the country and give him the airtime that he so desperately needs. All this sounds far-fetched, but it's handled in an interesting and unique way, not to mention it's clear and easy to follow.While the movie follows ""GoldenEye""'s example of action and humor, the dark realism is ditched in favor of a lighter, flashier, and more colorful atmosphere. This is demonstrated in the use of more gadgets, stunts, and jokes. None of this is inherently bad, like I mentioned before, but the final 45 minutes teeters on overload, and that's the part of the film where the fresh energy disappears and the plot becomes more and more frantic, as if even the filmmakers don't know how to top everything that came before it. This is partly true, because the script was actually being rewritten as the movie was being shot.Brosnan is much more comfortable than he was in his previous outing, but there's still the sense of trying to find his own identity. This can unfortunately be said of all his films, but for ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", he brings us a competent Bond that also has some demons, shown in the scene where he drinks alone in his hotel room. Pryce chews up the scenery in an enjoyable way, but it's also hard to take him seriously as a threat to Bond, and we know that his fate will be decided by the end of the film.One standout performance is, ironically, almost a cameo appearance. Vincent Schiavelli, who plays Dr. Kaufman, lends a creepy presence to his one scene and his look would have been perfect as the central villain. Even Judi Dench's M is more tolerable, and stands as a strong authority figure, while Hong Kong star Michelle Yeoh plays Bond's love interest, Wai Lin, and proves to be one of the better ""Bond equals"". Unfortunately, Götz Otto as Stamper and Teri Hatcher as Carver's wife, Paris, don't have a lot to do and don't leave a memorable impression in the Bond series.Continuing with the cons of the movie, the role of Carver's ally, General Chang, isn't clearly defined and it's almost as if he was forgotten about late in the shot. The martial arts, while capturing Yeoh abilities nicely, don't add to the plot and scream ""overkill"". They don't seem to have worked in any other Bond film, and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is no exception. Finally, the second half loses focus when compared to the rest of the movie, with the last shoot-out aboard the stealth ship being fairly uninspired, even though the special effects are top-notch throughout.The movie can still boast David Arnold's best and most distinct score, hearkening back to John Barry's earlier successes . The gadgets don't call attention to themselves, being inventive and fun, while two action scenes, the pre-title sequence and the remote-controlled chase in the parking garage, are highlights of the series. All-in-all, the film is more fractured than the early classics, but the quick pace makes up for it, causing ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" to become an enjoyable film to watch. Don't expect ""From Russia With Love"", but it's not ""A View To A Kill"", either. 7/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
219,asdodge,Erractic 2nd effort for Brosnan,6,15 December 2008,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is the 2nd Bond flick to feature Pierce Brosnan. While Brosnan solidifies his role as a very strong Bond, the story around him is inconsistent and does not live up to the expectations after his premiere in ""GoldenEye."" The story involves Bond investigating a series of military challenges between China and the UK which heightens tensions and could begin World War III. His investigations lead him into the world of multi-media mogul Elliot Carver (played by Jonathon Pryce in an obvious send-up of Rupert Murdoch). Along the way he meets up with a former lover, now Carver's wife (played by Terri Hatcher) and Chinese agent Wai Lin (played by Michelle Yeoh). Yeoh is fantastic as the Chinese agent and a perfect balance to Bond. The partnership they eventually form is well done. Hatcher is her usual mediocre self as a femme-fatale and Price parodies the extreme view of Murdoch in an over-the-top way which makes him less diabolical and more comical. The plot itself is reasonable and based somewhat in fact (a media giant trying to start a war for sales of his media- both Murdoch and Hearst could be rightly accused of it). The story also plays to the more espionage side of things rather than the super-agent stuff and the fight scenes are enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, the stereotyped henchman (the big blonde, ueber-strong German and the pseudo ex-Nazi evil doctor) are bland and iconoclastic. The pacing is also off, and what little sombre emotions are meant to be developed get lost in false sentimentality rather than true sentiment. The relationship between Bond and former lover could have been done much better. While the plot is within the world of believability and the action is definitely there and exciting, the film's pace does not flow... too jumpy, hectic and violent to too quiet and too serene. The movie is an okay Bond film and, if you are into the Bond Films, it will not disappoint, but one is left after viewing(s) with the feeling that it could have been much better with a little effort.",Tomorrow Never Dies
220,theonewithallthecontacts,One of the more underrated Bond films!,7,6 November 2012,"It was really hard for the next Bond film to top Goldeneye, and it didn't. Although the plot was somewhat stupid, the villains were over the top and the acting was sometimes a little bad. The film did however offer slightly more entertainment... the kind of entertainment where you can just turn your mind off, and enjoy the humor, the gadgets, the action, the women, the fast cars, etc. In my opinion this is a slightly underrated Bond film, which deserves more credit than it has received. The plot is as mentioned kinda stupid, but that's kind of a trademark for the Bond films... most of them anyway. I actually thought that the movie was enjoyable and funny. A worthy entry to the Bond series... and I still think that!The movie is centered about this media mogul named Elliot Carver, who wants to launch a third World War, so that he can cover the whole thing with his network. So the movie starts out with a cool action sequence, where Bond is to destroy a weapon station for terrorists (I think that's what it is). It's actually a pretty good opening sequence. After the title sequence the HMS Devonshire is sinked by what appears to be Chinese MIG's. In fact it is Carver and his Stealth Ship. A pretty good plot actually, but the whole thing drags out, and it becomes kinda over the top.I think personally that Roger Spottiswoode did a fine job as the director of the piece. He captured the whole 007 feeling and he made some pretty cool action sequences. I also like the cinematography, the sound and the sound editing.Pierce Brosnan is formidable as James Bond. You can see that he is getting comfortable with the role. Jonathan Pryce as Elliot Carver is actually a pretty memorable Bond villain. Most because he looks and feels like Rupert Murdoch and Steve Jobs. He does a fine job, and delivers what the script wants him to. Michelle Yeoh is one of my least favorite Bond girls. I know many people will disagree with me, but I think that her character is boring and I don't really buy her acting. Teri Hatcher however is a beautiful woman, a great actress and has very good chemistry with Brosnan. My only regret is that she doesn't get much screen time. Judi Dench plays M with perfection, as always. Ricky Jay, Gôtz Otto and Vincent Schiavelli also plays pretty good and over the top villains.I found this movie quite enjoyable and funny. While it is over the top, it's not more over the top than the other Bond films. One of the most underrated and unappreciated Bond films of all time.7/10",Tomorrow Never Dies

227,mcfische,A great action movie; a moderate Bond movie,5,10 October 2003,"May contain spoilersTOMORROW NEVER DIES was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli. Next to Desmond Llewelyn, no other member of the original Bond team has remained on the series as long as he has and will be remembered for always. Because of his death, his children Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson were left as the sole producers of the Bond franchise. Perhaps their father's death was the cause of the problems of this film.TOMORROW NEVER DIES looks like an ACTION film, it feels like an ACTION film, and is a good ACTION film, but Bond is not JUST an action film. He has suspense. He has the thriller/spy element. He has romance. He has drama. He has crime. Bond films are in their own genre, the Bond genre, and this film doesn't fit into that category. It is just an action film. Pierce Brosnan has matured into the part of James Bond from GOLDENEYE and gives a better performance. But it is still too Connery for my tastes and the compassion Bond has with his leading ladies is unbelievable for the character. Speaking of which, both Paris Carver and Wai Lin are excellent. But Wai Lin's falling in love with Bond is uncharacteristic for her, and again, Bond's emotional attachement to Paris is uncalled for. I like women with personality, but they shouldn't over-do it and try to give Bond a true love again. It's an insult to Fleming and OHMSS in particular. The MI6 staff returns doing a fantastic job, but Bill Tanner is left out, instead filled in by Robinson. He does a good job. Jack Wade also makes a welcome return. The villains have the worst problems. Elliot Carver is a one-dimensional, power-crazed, pure evil megalomaniac with no characterization. His age makes his confrontation and death by Bond very dull. Stamper is a stereotypical henchman. The only amusing villain is Dr. Kaufman, who describes doctorine in murder with excellent humor. The film has real-life stunts and incredible action, but that's all it focuses on.With it being an action film, not a Bond film, being the quickest way to summarize my complaints, this film gets a 5 out of 10.",Tomorrow Never Dies

In many reviews this car chase is mentioned as ""well done"" and ""typical Bond"".Excuse me !!??    First the bad guys try to smash the BMW's window with sledge hammers which is taken DIRECTLY from Knight Rider, then Bond steers the car remote controled which is just as childish. I don't watch Hasselhoff on TV and I don't want to see this kind of kid's TV show in the cinema either. Only thing that's missing is that Bond talks to the car!The acting is comparatively poor; compare the scene where Brosnan finds Hatcher's body in the hotel room to the similar scene in ""Licence to kill"" where Dalton finds Mrs. Leiter's body and you'll know what I mean.Many reviewers mention the fact that the female lead role has EVENTUALLY been upgraded. They must have missed the last 22 years of Bond films; in ""The spy who loved me"" from 1977 Triple-X gets as much room in the movie as our hero, in the teaser of that movie the girl is introduced as a match to Bond and ALL the leading ladies have been that since (with the exception of ""A view to a kill"" and ""The living daylights"").I'm a big fan of Brosnan's but I'm also still waiting for an acceptable Bond film featuring him as Bond.

233,Drew-36,When is a Bond Film not a Bond Film anymore?,6,22 December 1998,"When is a Bond Film not a Bond Film anymore? I'm not sure I like the way the Bond films are heading. While GoldenEye belongs near the top of the Bond ladder and was certainly in harmony with the rest of the series, this latest effort by disagreeable director Roger Spottiswoode feels more like a run-of-the mill action film than a subtle, intelligent espionage thriller. It has some very mundane, over-long action scenes, and in terms of the traditional Bond elements, the producers have got it all wrong. The female members of the cast are, on the whole, undesirable, and the Wai Lin character looks like she just stepped out of another film, and seems to me to be ridiculously out of place. Sure, the uninitiated have claimed that she is Bond's equal, a woman who can look after herself, and doesn't shout ""James! Don't leave me!"" every time she's in trouble. This was done to better effect in The Spy Who Loved Me, where Bond was teamed up with Agent Anya Amasova (Triple-X). Instead, here, Michelle Yeoh has no charm, no sex appeal and makes a pigs ear out of her role. She is clearly not in Bond's league: She tries to gain entry to a top secret room using the (alarmed) door, setting the alarm off and putting both her and Bond in extreme danger, and she's supposed to be good at her job. Yeah, right. A lot of what we see in the rest of the movie is conveyor belt popcorn, and the plot is laughably thin. In terms of villains, Jonathan Pryce is too camp to be a threat to Bond, and Gotz Otto as Mr. Stamper would make a better living doing Calvin Klein ads instead of trying to be a vile henchman. While it's nice to see Desmond Llewellyn back again, he'd be far more sensible to use his technical know-how to design a chairlift for himself, instead of building cars for James Bond. Niggles aside, there are some decent moments in the film. The teaser, although nowhere near as good as GoldenEye's, is reasonably exciting and cleverly introduces us to some of the main characters The only thing that allows this film to rise out of the sub Die Hard genre is the outstanding car chase in the multi-story parking building. This short scene is accompanied by a thumping soundtrack by The Propellerheads and summarises everything we have come to expect from a Bond film- thrills, excitement, gadgets, some great stunts, Bond outwitting his captors and escaping, and a satisfying pay-off. This very weak entry into the series is not enough to make me lose my faith in Bond just yet, but if the Producers attempt to bring us more of the same with the next Bond film, i.e. numb the audience with banal action, and attempt a pastiche of Con Air, I might think again about my loyalty to Her Majesty's Secret Service.",Tomorrow Never Dies

235,Orpington,"Action-packed and glitzy, but utterly shallow",5,14 September 2004,"The huge success of GoldenEye ensured the future of the Bond franchise, and when Tomorrow Never Dies came along two years later it again did big business at the Box Office, confirming OO7's enduring popularity. Sadly, if falls a long way short of the standards set by its predecessor, sacrificing any attempts at plot or character development in favour of a non-stop succession of action sequences, flashy gadgets and hi-tech sets. The result is a film that is mildly entertaining but lacking in any real tension, threat or depth, making it one of the most forgettable and disappointing entries in the Bond franchise.One of the big disappointments of the film is Pierce Brosnan's Bond. After his excellent debut performance in GoldenEye, which presented OO7 as a well-rounded character, Brosnan is given a script in TND which requires him to do nothing more than go through the motions. He therefore does all the usual Bond things - the fighting, the seduction, the quips - but the depth that he brought to the character in GoldenEye is totally missing, as this film is only interested in Bond as action hero. There is one particularly cringeworthy scene where Brosnan wanders around wielding a machine gun like Arnie or Sly Stallone, not exactly the behaviour you would expect from Ian Fleming's gentleman spy, but certainly what you would expect from filmmakers whose only concern is to make as many dollars as possible.Brosnan's flat performance is matched by his co-stars. Jonathan Pryce's Elliot Carver is arguably the weakest villain ever to appear in a Bond film; he is not remotely threatening, and Pryce is so hammy in the role he just makes Carver camp and extremely irritating. As for the women, Michelle Yeoh's high-kicking Wai Lin certainly holds her own against OO7 in the fight scenes, but Yeoh is far from being either an accomplished actress or a great beauty, and Wai Lin is a forgettable and one-dimensional Bond girl. Teri Hatcher, as the doomed Paris Carver, scores over Yeoh in the looks department, but Paris is another character who lacks any real depth, and in any case she is disposed of quite rapidly. The film's lack of originality is also underscored by the appearance of yet another blonde, Red Grant-style henchman, who is about as unmemorable as you can get. The only cast members who really shine are Vincent Schiavelli as the comically evil Dr Kaufman, a classic ""talking villain,"" and Judi Dench as M; Q is also back once more, in an all-too-brief scene, in order to give Bond his fancy remote-controlled BMW.Rather like the characters, the plot takes second place to the action, although the premise of a media tycoon trying to engineer a war for ratings is at least contemporary, and if it had been fleshed out properly it could have been interesting. As it is, the story is just a peg on which to hang the action, and all it really does is retread the scripts of You Only Live Twice and The Spy Who Loved Me, albeit in glossier fashion. As far as the action sequences themselves are concerned, director Roger Spottiswoode undoubtedly pulls them off with flair, but for the most part they just feel formulaic and unexciting; indeed, there are points where TND feels more like a John Woo-style film than a Bond adventure. The look of the film is also very stylised and self-consciously ""modern,"" so much so that it will probably seem quite dated in years to come, more so than some older Bond films. It is another element that makes the film all style and no substance.In essence, TND is about as shallow as a Bond film can get. I did like David Arnold's Barryesque score, and Sheryl Crow's title song is quite good, but generally speaking the film is nothing more than mindless popcorn entertainment. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, of course, but Bond films can, and should, amount to something more, and for that reason TND is one of my least favourite in the entire canon.",Tomorrow Never Dies
236,ardemus,why the low rating?,8,30 May 2003,"i've been watching the bond movies in reverse order it seems... i saw die another day as my first bond movie (yes i know i started late).  but i really love pierce brosnan as bond.  so far i've liked all the ones i've seen.  i don't know why people are all bashing this movie though.  the action sequences were great (especially the chase scene with the BMW). the plot was good too.  i do agree that there wasn't much chemistry between brosnan and michelle yeoh (she has a terrible accent too!  couldn't they have found an asian girl who speaks english?  how bout zhang ziyi??).
so other than that... i really enjoyed this movie!  Die Another Day is still my fav Bond movie, maybe because it was my first? so i give TND 8/10.",Tomorrow Never Dies
237,elgronko,Empty-headed action movie,2,20 October 2010,"I'm a big fan of Bond but for some reason never sat through this one all the way until yesterday - it just seemed too much like an empty-headed action movie, and whenever it came on TV I ended up turning it off with a headache.After watching it yesterday I have to say, what the hell is going on?! Pierce Brosnan was actually better here as Bond than in Goldeneye - he got a haircut, thank God - but the script he was given was just pathetic. Unlike others here I have no gripe with the villain or his scheme, but I definitely do have a problem with Bond mowing people down with machine guns the whole time.This is JAMES BOND, the English super-spy, not bloody Rambo! People get upset with Dalton's psychotic Bond in 'Licence To Kill', but at least he only kills the principal bad guys. 'Tomorrow Never Dies' must have the highest body count of all the Bond films; oddly Bond's behaviour reminded me of Max Zorin's in 'A View To A Kill' who machineguns his henchmen after flooding his underground lair - a scene Roger Moore publicly objected to.Another major quibble is that the action itself was confusing and filled with ""deus ex machina"" twists that are neither explained nor anticipated. How dis the chain-in-the-copter-rotor thing work? What was with the explode-the-detonator thing at the end? What was the thing inside Bond's watch that smashed the little jar and how did that set off the grenade? Where did Bond get it from - does he carry jam jars around just in case? Ironically this is probably Brosnan's best performance as Bond, but it is wasted in this asinine, confusing action movie that just doesn't feel like a Bond film at all. And can someone please explain the title?",Tomorrow Never Dies
238,Sowerplave,"The first, truly modern James Bond movie - 7/10",7,16 December 2020,"In anticipation for No Time to Die, I decided to watch all James Bond movies. This, almost 25 year old movie, is in my opinion, the first truly modern James Bond movie. Licence to Kill may have been the first non-orthodox James Bond movie with the personal vendetta storyline, rather than the secret agent on his duty for Queen and country. GoldenEye may have been the first post Soviet, post Iron Curtain movie, but it's not possible to ignore that the movie starts off with a USSR backstory intro. That movie's plot, and character stories, were branded and tattooed enough with Soviet elements for it to not really break any new grounds.Short review: Tomorrow Never Dies was such a heavy departure from the earlier movies, that this could have been any action movie instead of being a James Bond movie. This isn't a spy movie with action elements. This is an action movie with spy elements. There are both good and ugly things with this movie.Long review and breakdown:Visual:
This is the first movie that is not produced, or supervised by Albert R. Broccoli - to whom the movie was dedicated in memory of. The visuals of the movie was a profound giveaway of the fact that it is helmed by someone else. I was stricken by how old and natural this movie didn't look. Pretty much all of the prior James Bond movies to this have had open and wide environments. If not in natural outdoor environments, then, more often than not, in carefully decorated indoor environments. In contrast, the majority of this movie presents small and synthetic environments without any life in the background of the scenes. It only looks newer, rather than looking reinvigorated. It manages to become ugly instead of eye-catching. Again, it's an almost 25 year old movie. But I would never look at it as a classic Bond movie - simply because it doesn't look anything like a classic Bond movie.Sound:
While it doesn't look like any previous Bond movie at all, it certainly manages to sound like a classic Bond movie. The movie theme song, the surf guitar playing away the Bond main theme song during chase scenes and erupting in the big band style sound, the soft orchestral versions of the movie's theme in character interaction scenes - it had all of it, and some more! The previous couple of movie(s) may have had a strong ambience game. I enjoyed this throwback style of soundtrack throughout the movie.Story:
The main antagonist of the movie is a prominent media baron, who uses his media group muscles to manipulate the UK and China into a war against eachother, for the benefit of his media business. All the breaking, all the latest - all from him. I should mention that this is a 25 year old movie. This movie and story is a product of a time when the media consumtion and news journalism still were centralized. In today's world with decentralized media, the decay of news journalism, and the dawn of social media, it's possible to argue that this movie's story might have aged like milk, or aged like wine. I don't think that this has aged anything in particular, at all. You could replace the antagonist publisher, and his print and broadcast media, with an antagonist social media mogul, and their app and internet media instead, and still have the same movie with no context lost in time and the evolution of visual media consumtion.All in all, it's not a great movie. But it's not a bad movie, either. Not a classic Bond movie, but still due to some recognition as a groundbreaking turning point to the style and presentation of a Bond movie.",Tomorrow Never Dies
239,chrisf-uk,pitiful,2,18 November 2001,"Oh dear, what a mess. I grew up with the Roger Moore movies, and for me he epitomizes what Bond is all about. Class, wit and sly cunning.
Where to begin ? The casting is just plain awful. The oh-so-scary main villain and his teenaged henchman are utterly laughable. Did anyone find them *remotely* threatening ? Love interest Teri Hatcher is wooden and unconvincing. Not even Q, wheeled out for the token gadget scene, can rescue this dud (a gadget scene, incidentally, that shamelessly pushes product placement to new levels). And, sorry, but Brosnan simply doesn't convince me in the lead role. His bland, blow-dried good looks put me more in mind of a car salesman than a ruthless assassin.Like other reviewers, I'm bothered by the brutality of this movie. Bond murders an innocent security guard after he breaks into the newspaper offices, and machine-guns some 20-odd extras in the tedious climax.And I can't finish without mentioning the alleged 'witty' dialog between Bond and Moneypenny. Her 'cunning linguist' and 'pump her for information' comments are so blunt and obvious it's painful. This is Bond, so I'd expect the odd double entendre - that scene's just embarassing.Did I go on long enough ? Avoid this rotten excuse for a movie.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Although I own a BMW, I quickly got sick of seeing the BMW emblem emblazoned on each possible item in the movie. It was completely ridiculous. At certain points the camera shots were so obviously centered around a certain brand that towards the end it seemed like one long commercial. Whereas before, advertising in the series was more subtle (Rolex and Smirnoff) now it has become the big star in the movie instead of Pierce Brosnan.I enjoyed Goldeneye immensely, but this was a flop. The only good thing about the movie was Michelle Yeoh (but the martial arts cinematography did not detail the action as well as a Hong Kong cinematographer would). Dismal.

The movie is enjoyable to watch and the action sequences are fun also. What seems to make this as a unique Bond film is the different types of weapons and gadgets that are shown in the movie. The story line is also makes the movie fun. I think this Bond movie is probably one the best Pierce Brosnan 007 movies. The movie is not so long and the scenes move at a fair pace. Prior to Goldeneye, this sets off a new type of Bond formula. I think this 007 movie is probably better than the Bond movies with Daniel Craig.

247,UltraMagic,Back on Solid Ground,7,18 August 1998,"It is with a sense of satisfaction that I report that our man in London has returned to the foal.  The franchise that has, through so many incarnations , wandered aimlessly (bending uncomfortably in the 80's to cultural whims and plots dependent on novelty cinematic effects, and in the early 90's spinning in circles in search of it's own identity) seems to have landed on both legs, solidly.""TND"" is tight, moving along nicely in the spirit of the best cinematic realizations of our agent and his exploits.  It offers an almost perfect balance of story, character, action and effects to, at the very least, leave any Bond junkie with a sense of optimism regarding the future of 007 's exploits in the Cloak-and-Dagger field.Brosnan is no Connery, but he IS Bond.  Which is NOT to say Connery was not Bond, but it is to say that Brosnan's Bond is not Connery's, although it SURELY is Bond nevertheless.On another subject, Sheryl  Crow is NOT Bond.  k.d. lang, now THAT is Bond, all over, man, and does she have a set of pipes on her, or what?!

Brosnan again fills the role of Bond as if it was tailored for him. Add all this and throw in a very wonderful, beautiful, and exciting Michelle Yoeh and you have a great Bond film!",Tomorrow Never Dies
249,Gigante,Shaken and Stirred,9,14 August 1999,"Right from the start you can tell this was going to be a good Bond film. The opening sequence is great, if not predictable and we get an early peek at some one-liners......'Back seat drivers.' Pierce Brosnan really comes into his own in this film and although not the best Bond, he still has time to reach Connery's level. Disappointing though were the Bond girls. Michell Yeoh is great for action but we need beauty aswell in a Bond girl and she just didn't have that 'come and get me' feel that some of the earlier Bond girls did. And Terri Hatcher was wasted, although she did give birth during production so her part was cut. It remains to be seen whether she could have gone on to better things. Carver was an average bad-guy and how long was he waiting for the sea-drill to chop him up at the end? But I liked the idea of him starting a war for ratings. It proves that you don't need to blow up the world to control it like Blofeld and Drax. Henchmen.....well the fight scene in the sound room was excellent, the chase through the press factory was exciting and the car chase was a bit cheesy. But I just felt the baddies weren't putting in as much effort as they used to be. Carver's men were always on top in numbers yet failed to take the advantage (although it is Bond we are talking about). Mr Stamper had the potential but failed to live up to it. It seems as though the main bad guys in the last 5 or so films have not been getting the right people to help. First of all I hate women henchmen like MayDay and Onatop in Goldeneye. They lack the physical contact. I'd prefer it if we went back to the old style henchmen like Oddjob, Jaws and Red Grant. Hopefully we'll see a better one in the World is Not Enough (Renard I believe).TND is a very good Bond film, although like many of its kind it is filled with gadgets and action scenes. What about that wire-cutter that appeared from Bond's car to slice the metal wire that had been tightened across the road? That was cheesy.9/10 though. A must for Bond fans and I don't see how anyone can claim it to be otherwise. It is far superior to Goldeneye, both the Dalton films and many of Moore's efforts (not including AVTAK). Bring on the next Bond.",Tomorrow Never Dies
250,s007davis,"Top-notch '90s action flick even if ""Ian Fleming's James Bond"" is starting to resemble Bruce Willis",8,26 November 2001,"Warning, this review may contain spoilers for this and other Bond films. In the world of James Bond movies, certain films could easily have a subtitle to them: MOONRAKER(""The Outer-Space Bond""), THUNDERBALL(""The Underwater Bond""), YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE(""The Japan Bond""), LICENCE TO KILL (""The Edgy, Dark, Realistic Bond""), ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE(""The 007 Gets Married Bond""), DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER(""The Las Vegas Bond""). If TOMORROW NEVER DIES had a subtitle it would be ""The Non-Stop Action, Cuts, Explosions Bond.""  Essentially scriptwriter Bruce Feirstein took the stories of 2 previous Bonds(YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME)fused them together, streamlined them for a late 1990s movie audience that likes the aforementioned non-stop action, cuts, and explosions ladled out with the subtlety of a sledgehammer and cares little for characterization, suspense, or dramatic tension. Not to say TOMORROW is a bad film. On the contrary, of all 3 of the 1990s 007 flicks, TND is the one I enjoyed the most on my initial viewing of it in the cinema. My immediate response after seeing it the first time was to give it ***1/2 out of ****. When I saw it a 2nd time, my initial enthusiasm for it tempered somewhat. Nonetheless, after even multiple viewings, I still give it a solid *** ""good"" rating. TND contains many positive ingredients. Although Pierce Brosnan's debut Bond GOLDENEYE featured a stronger story and a more alluring heroine, TND still  improves over its predecessor in many ways. For one thing, Roger Spottiswoode's direction has a fluidity that Martin Campbell's lacked in the previous film. Also the editing of scenes together is smoother and less abrupt than in the previous entry. Perhaps the most obvious improvement of all, was the replacing of Eric Serra with David Arnold, the best Bond composer since John Barry. Arnold's work incorporates the classic ""James Bond theme"" over and over that was so conspicuously absent in GOLDENEYE as well as nicely scoring both the action sequences (especially the pre-title sequence) and the love scenes between Brosnan and Teri Hatcher. Arnold's end title song ""Surrender"" is a real show-stopper with a classy ""Diamonds Are Forever""-type feel to it(very interesting that Don Black  provided the lyrics for both tunes).Brosnan gives a much more self-assured and confident performance as Bond(Of course, having just come off a $350 million plus megahit should bolster the confidence of anyone.) He seems to grow more comfortable with the role each time he plays it. As for the new ""regulars""(Judi Dench as M and Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny) both actresses seem more comfortable in their roles this time around as well. The same sadly can't be said for Joe Don Baker as CIA man Jack Wade. Although Baker was reasonably amusing as Wade in GOLDENEYE (as well as having portrayed a villain in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS), in TND he comes off as more obnoxious than J.W. Pepper. Thankfully, his screen time is short and he did not return in the next Bond epic THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. Hopefully, we have seen the last of Wade and the Bond producers will bring the real CIA agent/Bond ally Felix Leiter back instead. Jonathan Pryce plays Elliot Carver in the mode of Charles Gray's Blofeld from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Like Gray, Pryce(BRAZIL) is a fine actor and amusing to watch but doesn't provide 007 with any real physical threat(like Robert Shaw in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE) or provide the kind of intellectual duel Bond had with villainous greats Goldfinger, Scaramanga, or Sanchez. Michelle Yeoh portrays the athletic heroine competently but her Wai Lin character too obviously replicates THE SPY WHO LOVED ME's Triple X (female superspy from a Communist superpower who initially rivals then allies with 007).The Bond/Wai Lin relationship never gets to develop in an interesting way as the Bond/Triple X one did in the earlier film thanks to TND's over dependence on action at the expense of the storyline. To Feirstein's credit, Wai Lin doesn't make the mistake that her 2 immediate predecessors(Natalya in GOLDENEYE, Pam in LICENCE TO KILL) did by falling for Bond after a quick introduction and one action sequence. Instead, Miss Yeoh(in the tradition of Ursula Andress, Honor Blackman, Jane Seymour, Jill St. John, Barbara Bach, Lois Chiles and others)  makes Bond work his charm on her first before succumbing to the obligatory clinch. In fact, the Bond/Wai Lin relationship is the most platonic one Bond has had with a woman since his relationship with Melina/Carole Bouquet in 1981's FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. Like Melina, Wai Lin doesn't even let Bond kiss her till the end(and  in TND its to save her life from drowning).Although Miss Yeoh survives to the end, the ""real love interest"" for Bond this time is Teri Hatcher as Paris Carver, the villain's wife and the woman who got ""too close"" to 007. The chemistry between Miss Hatcher and Brosnan is incredible starting with their witty repartee (""How about the words I'll be right back"") at Carver's party. Their sparks intensify with their love scene which is the most intensely romantic one Bond has had with a woman since Kara in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.  Later, when Bond discovers her murderedbody in his bed, Brosnan shows a genuine sadness reminiscent of the final scene in OHMSS where Bond's wife is killed. It's sad that Miss Hatcher(who would make a worthy Bond heroine as her work on TV's LOIS & CLARK proved, is given so little screen time as her Paris character gives TND the film's best non-action moments such as the one where Bond sits alone in his hotel room with his drink and his gun waiting for Paris to come to him. The idea of Bond running across a former lover and her having to chose between him and the villain is a good one and I hope reappears (better developed and with more screentime of course) in a future film. Spottiswoode stages the action sequences spectacularly. The standouts in this area include the pre-title teaser sequence involving a terrorist bazaar with MI6 personnel watching Bond's adventures on a large video screen and a delightfully over the top motorcycle/helicopter chase across Saigon with Bond and Miss Lin handcuffed to each other (Hitchcock fans will easily see how TND stole this idea from the classic THE 39 STEPS). Despite its many entertaining aspects, TND is not without blemishes. The credits loudly proclaim Pierce Brosnan as ""Ian Fleming's James Bond"",  but with the exception of the scenes with Mrs. Carver and her murderer Dr. Kauffman there's little of Ian Fleming's creation to be found(such as Brosnan saying such PC statements as ""Never argue with a woman. They're always right"" or referring to smoking as a ""Filthy habit."" The real Bond would never say those things). Also, there is something fundamentally disturbing about a film's politics that lets Communist China(one of the most oppressive dictatorships on the face of the earth)off the hook yet vilifies Rupert Murdoch(in the guise of Carver) who provides one of the fairest and most informative news networks in the world. While the action is all spectacularly staged, the gunfire, cuts and explosions go into overkill after a while. If FOR YOUR EYES ONLY had the most underwhelming final conflict to a Bond flick, then TND wins the opposite award for the most overdone as ""Ian Fleming's Bond"" turns into Pierce Brosnan's version of Bruce Willis in DIE HARD. While this ""cuts/explosions approach"" is done to attract younger viewers weaned on MTV, its sad that so many new Bond fans will watch TND and then complain how true Bond classics that more accurately reflect Fleming's works and characters(such as Terence Young's FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL) are ""boring"" by comparison because they were made in a era when scriptwriting, wit and style were more important than explosions and cuts. Complaints aside, TOMORROW NEVER DIES makes for 2 hours of mostly satisfying action entertainment though I'm glad its sequel THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH put greater emphasis on Bond's humanity and brought back some traditional ""Flemingesque"" elements.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Moneypenny also was quite funny: ""you were also a cunning linguist"" and ""you'll just determine how much pumping is needed"". (they were hilarious in context.)

The only good things about TND was the opening credits, Michelle Yeoh's suberb acting, Pierce Brosnan's acting, and the cool gadgets. The best bond film to me is GoldenEye, then Live and Let Die, then Dimonds are Forever, then For Your Eyes Only, and then The World is Not Enough. I give TND ** out of 10 stars.",Tomorrow Never Dies
263,doublen5500,WOW! This is Bond baby!,1,24 February 2001,"When I had first saw TND I thought it was ridiculous. I thought it was boring and the action was a bit too over the top. When I heard that it was going to be the CBS Sunday night movie during a week in January, I decided to give TND another shot.I saw TND again and all I can say is that a few months ago I had never felt sooooo wrong in my entire life. I saw it again and I went crazy for Bond! People say that TND was ""90% action, 10% plot"". I think that they're wrong. There was a lot of the plot incorporated in the film and that there was a lot of drama and comedy in the film as well.The action scenes were fabulous. The motorcycle chase and the car chase were really enjoyable. I also loved the script. Bruce Feirstein and company made a great script with an interesting plot. It was a great choice from MGM to have Roger Spottiswoode as the director of TND. He had all the scenes made to near perfection. The acting had its good and bad points sadly. Pierce Brosnan was superb as always. He really wasn't relaxed in GoldenEye but in TND, he was as cool as ice. Elliot Carver has to be the most cheesy villian in Bond history. I thought Jonathan Pryce would knock some sense into Carver, but just made Carver even cheesier. Teri Hatcher was lame as Paris Carver. All she did was make Paris into a wimpy sex kitten.The best thing in all of TND had to be Wai-Lin. Michelle Yeoh steals the show in TND. She was the perfect Bond girl. She had class, style, brains (take that Kara Milovy!), beauty, sex appeal, and most of all she could give an ass whippin! She is my all time favorite Bond girl! She also had great chemistry with Brosnan.Please, please ignore my first comment on TND with I made a few months ago! I must have had a little too much of Grandpa's couch syrup.
James Bond will return, hopefully with Michelle Yeoh!",Tomorrow Never Dies

265,NS_writings,A worthy follow-up to GoldenEye.,9,27 May 2021,"'Tomorrow Never Dies' is frequently misjudged. In comparison to 'GoldenEye' -and even the other Brosnan films- we have all the elements introduced from the get go: we know who the villains are, what are they up to, and Bond has a seemingly easy road to follow. In terms of cinematography and editing, it lacks the punch of its predecessor, mainly due to the rushed production (MGM's Kirk Kerkorian counted with a Christmas '97 release). However, the film is pretty relevant and brought to the table something we never had in a Bond film: mass media, used as a weapon. 'Tomorrow Never Dies' explores the ambition of the corporate power and how far they can reach to overthrow governments: ""Capable of toppling governments with a single broadcast"", Bond says of media mogul Carver, also described as ""The Emperor of The Air"". There are many, but many references to cyber-surveillance and George Orwell's '1984', that go from the aesthetic (big banners featuring the villain's face, the villain himself summoning people from huge TV screens and a character who signs her death sentence through an innocent quip on Bond's lifestyle, ignoring she was being watched and heard at all times. The action scenes are spectacular and well-developed, the soundtrack recovers the traditionalism that Eric Serra's work for 'GoldenEye' lacked, and the story between Bond and Paris -despite its short screentime- is quite compelling as this woman has known 007 years before the events of the film, which adds an extra layer of emotion. Despite Robert Elswit's cinematography in exteriors could have been improved (particularly when it comes to Thailand and Hamburg), the interiors look quite imaginative, particularly in Carver's newsroom: a dark place lit only by a static palette steaming from TV screens. And Allan Cameron, who was also the production designer for the second film adaptation of '1984', contributes to enhance this ""Ministry of Truth"" feeling to the place.",Tomorrow Never Dies

At least 'Goldeneye' had some redeeming moments like good chemistry, a good villain, impressive stunts, and attractive women, but MY GOD that film was so cheesy. This film just adds more cheese and cringey dialogue, and it makes it almost unwatchable. If you removed Teri Hatcher's character from the plot, it wouldn't change anything. She gets killed off in the second act, and the film just moves on to another bad action sequence.You would expect Jonathan Pryce to be a decent bond villain, but his motivation is just ridiculous and the audience is supposed to take it seriously. I mean 'Goldeneye' was a little stupid, but the writers for this movie just smoked too much coke.I do give praise to Pierce Brosnan for giving another decent performance as Agent 007, despite the stupid dialogue he's given.

269,Kyle007,Tomorrow has the power!,10,19 April 2005,"OK, this is what i call an action movie, a great one, it has everything you need to make your adrenaline flow. And of course it also does it for a Bond movie, it has funny lines, clichés, gadgets, and it deliver us a movie that is pure action and danger without losing the sense of humour (like all Bond movies).James Bond had always fought to the powerful, but this is the first time, i think, that he deals to a press magnate like Elliot Carver, who cares nothing about an informed world as he says, but to get all the power and money that he can. In WW2, the men who took advantage of the war were those who manufactured weapons, in the 90's, the medias gain as much money as them, so Elliot decides to begin a war to have the complete coverage of the deed, so our fellow agent 007 must stoop this crazy guy from beginning a war just for economic reasons.... So, we can say the plot is quite good and original as well, nobody can say no.And this movie was a great follow up to the blockbuster mega hit that was Goldeneye, Pierce Brosnan shining as the British agent, as he always did in his 007 period. Michelle Yeoh was great too, and she portrayed perfectly good the woman of the 90's: Independent, fighting side by side with men, even defeating them, smart, pretty, well the 90's woman......The music by Sheryl Crow is lovely and sweet, and fits great into the atmosphere of the movie, something on what the producers of the Bond movies always lay stress on. A good Bond movie needs a good song, and a good car too, ja.""The difference between craze and greatness is measured only by success"" ""There's no news, like bad news"" This is an example of Carver's ""philosophy"" of life, funny thing to hear, you realize he is a crazy that believes what he says....So, if you are an action lover this movie is for you, and if you are a Bond lover this movie will like you too.",Tomorrow Never Dies
270,veronicapranjic,The first Bond movie I ever watched,7,2 May 2015,"This is the first Bond movie I ever watched. I think it's a great companion to a superb GoldenEye. While GoldenEye dismantled the character and questioned whether he fits in the post Cold War world this one proved Bond is still very much the thing with all the classical Bond tropes. The crazy villain with a crazy plan. Bond doing something Bondesque every five minutes and the famous theme kicking every time he does that. Bond ""learning a new tongue"". The plot is about starting a WW3 so Elliot Carver could make a hell of a lot of money with ratings. He is splendidly over-the-top and he has to be-the plot is grander than life as well. Sure,this movie isn't as smart,sophisticated and well-though out as GoldenEye but it is an unashamed throwback at the classics like ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". All three films were released in years that end with 7(1967,1977,1997),they all feature plots about starting WW3 and they all feature Bond in a commander suit. This movie also features that wonderful British empiralism. While GoldenEye dismantled the character this one picked him from the ground up. The classic soundtrack that just screams ""Bond"". It is a big,loud confirmation that Bond was truly back. This movie is generally looked as a ""not-as-good as GoldenEye"" but it's a great companion to it. It features all those so-well-known things that one expects from a Bond movie. also-I need to mention the scene that is undoubtly one of the best in the series-the one with Dr.Kaufmann. Dr.Kaufman is splendidly amusing and Bond is barely amused with his techniques. He kills him in cold- blood and the sets the things up so it would look like he committed suicide. it's brilliant. In the end-this is the very first movie I ever watched and it's always going to hold a special place in my heart. The scene were we see only Aston Martin at Oxford and then Bond practicing his Danish. Pure Bond.",Tomorrow Never Dies
271,Genevieve_Patrick,(4.5) Contains one of my favorite action scenes in a Bond film,8,23 September 2009,"Two years after Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film ""Goldeneye"", he returns for his second Bond outing in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". Though not as sharp as Goldeneye, this Bond film is still strong and probably Brosnan's second best Bond film. The story behind Tomorrow Never Dies actually felt somewhat original. Stories seemed to become a rehash lately of previous Bond films, all focusing too much on world domination and Russia always somehow being involved. An insane maniac known as Elliot Carter wishes for that similar world domination, but in a unique style. In successful attempts at pitting China against Britain in hopes of starting a third world war, Carter's secret attacks from his stealth ship enable him to write tomorrow's news today - and broadcast world wide along all forms of media. The clever and twisted results would give Carter fame and glory, as well as richness beyond belief, while watching the world tear itself apart around him. Technology has made a proufound impact in this Bond movie, between Carter's media and his stealth ship. The technology made this Bond film quite up to date, and felt fitting. Tomorrow Never Dies has a decent list of characters. Brosnan seems like the same Bond since Goldeneye - not a tremendous performance, but complete none the less. Carter is an original villain with his clever ways, but still can't compare to some of the more famous classic Bond villains. Carter's henchman is a fine choice, having the look of another ex-KGB brute, and like past KGB villains, giving Bond an excellent final fight. The Bond girl - Michelle Yeoh - is actually my favorite Bond girl. She does just about as much as James to get the mission accomplished. And the best part is - she knows martial arts. If you are familiar with Michelle Yeoh, you may have seen her in Crouching Tiger or Jackie Chan's Supercop. She is no stranger to excellent martial arts, and gets a couple of great fights here. The best part of this movie is a tremendous action scene that I love. It involves a motorcycle chase down the streets of Saigon. Both Bond and Wei (Yeoh) are handcuffed together on the bike, outrunning cars and a helicopter. They drive everywhere - on tops of building and through them. The best part of the chase is when the helicopter turns vertical, using its blades to tear up everything down the street. People are running while the chopper chases down the bike in the crowd. Its quite amazing to see a chopper in that position. Overall, this is a great Bond film. Not the best, but one of the better. It won't go down with the classics, but it has some fun characters, an original story, and some great action to keep it very entertaining.

And gadgets and BMW - car, motorbike...and more gadgets galor really are the stars. Bond (litrally takes a back seat).

Pierce Brosnan did a very good job. Also the villain (Elliot Carver) is brilliant, not to mention his sidekick Stamper, who plays the role as sidekick how it should be played. Also the two women in the film (Way Lin & Paris Carver) play an important role. Also the storyline is very well thought out. I especially like the way the mass media is used to try to conquer the world.Also Q plays an important role, as this film brings some great gadgets along with it (the best is of course the 7 series BMW). But also the gadgets in Lin's Chinese office deserve a mention.Also this film doesn't lose it's excitement, as it keeps the spectators on the edges of their seats from start to finish. Some other Bond movies (especially the older ones) tend to get a little boring because of their written out plot divergences, whereas this Bond film doesn't have a single boring period in it.That said, I think this film is the best one we've seen Pierce Brosnan in. One of the best Bond films and an all time Bond classic.",Tomorrow Never Dies
276,gordon_brennan,One of the best action-intensive Bond films,8,25 September 2009,"Tomorrow Never Dies is directed by Roger Spottiswoode. The film stars Pierce Brosnan and co-stars Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Yeoh, Teri Hatcher, Ricky Jay, Gotz Otto, Joe Don Baker, Vincent Schiavelli, Judi Dence, Desmond Llewelyn, Samantha Bond, Colin Salmon, Geoffrey Palmer, Julian Fellowes. David Arnold contributes the film's score and Sheryl Crow sings the title song. K.D. Lang and Moby also make contributions. Following a mission to an arms bazaar, in which he successfully stops a potential nuclear disaster, James Bond is given another assignment. Elliot Carver, one of the most-renowned media moguls in the world, has recently published a report on a disaster in the South China Sea. However, M becomes suspicious when his publications all get their information suspiciously fast, so Bond is sent to investigate. Teaming up with a Chinese agent, Bond pursues this new threat, who is ultimately trying to turn the east and west against each other, and start another world war. Tomorrow Never Dies is a far cry from other James Bond films, because it's more of a straight action film, with far less emphasis on espionage. What's even more surprising is that this change of pace still makes for an enjoyable film. It's not quite the masterpiece Goldeneye was before it, but it's still one of the above-average entries in the series. Once again Pierce Brosnan is excellent as Bond. Easily one of the best actors to play the role, he wins the audience over in scene after scene. Whether he's trying to woo over Carver's wife to get information out of her or in the midst of a motorcycle chase in eastern Asia, he gives another great Bond performance here. And yet again, the supporting cast is brilliant. Jonathan Pryce does a great job as Elliot Carver, James Bond's latest nemesis. I'm not sure how best to describe his performance or character, but I'll put it this way - this is one of the more memorable Bond villains of recent years. Also great is Michelle Yeoh, who portrays Bond's Chinese ally in the battle against Carver and his schemes. As tough and daring than Bond, she's a great character and steals the show in every scene she is featured in. Some brief but still memorable roles include Joe Don Baker reprising his role as CIA agent Jack Wade, and Vincent Schiavelli as an assassin hired by Carver. Great cast, need I say more? As far as action scenes go, this film offers more of them than a good many Bond films, and these are some of the finest around. Amongst the great scenes are its pre-credits scene with Bond attempting to stop a nuclear disaster, a motorcycle chase through an Asian village, and of course, the final battle in Carver's ocean hideaway. You'll never take your eyes off the screen. The only real weakness with this film is its plot. The whole ""turning two nations against each other to start another world war"" thing essentially carbon-copied from You Only Live Twice - Carver is trying to do the same thing Blofeld tried in that earlier film. Likewise, the ""tomorrow's news today"" thing is nothing new. Still, there aren't enough issues here to derail the film. This was the first James Bond film to be scored by David Arnold, now the regular scorer of Bond films. Unlike the experimental and often ill-received Eric Serra score from the previous Bond outing, Goldeneye, Arnold's score is vintage Bond. He borrows heavily from John Barry's style and, of course, reprises Monty Norman's classic Bond theme. He puts his own unique spin on things as well, giving this classical-styled music a modern twist. The multi-talented Sheryl Crow performs the title song, one of the best Bond opening themes of recent years. Equally impressive is the film's closing credits song, Surrender, performed by K.D. Lang. And also not to be overlooked in the music is a remix of the James Bond theme done by Moby - which is better than you might think! There is a lot of great music here, adding to an already-great film. Ultimately, Tomorrow Never Dies is a success. It's not the most plot-intensive Bond film out there, but that doesn't matter. This is an above-average Bond film with action scenes galore, and a memorable cast of characters in every scene. Easily one of the best post-eighties Bond films. Thumbs up This film, like all of the other official EON productions, was remastered and reissued in 2006. Be sure to get one of the new remastered versions, because the frame-by-frame remaster job is incredible.",Tomorrow Never Dies
277,StephenC,Bond turns into a typical action film. How the mighty have fallen.,4,21 March 1999,"This movie starts well.  Someone manipulating the GPS satellite system throws a British naval ship off course into China's waters, then from a mysterious stealth ship launches an attack on both sides with their opposition's weapons, sparking an international incident.  Your pump is well primed for some ultimately evil villain.You can turn off the pump now.Jonathan Pryce plays some sort of Rupert Murdoch/Ted Turner gone insane, using his copious monetary holdings and his control over mass media to create this incident and start World War 3.  And why is he doing this? (This, by the way, isn't revealed until well into the story, leaving you even more confused.)  Because he wants to obtain exclusive broadcast rights in China for his network.  Now I'm laughing, since the war he's starting will undoubtedly destroy China anyway, and the remaining folk probably won't have TVs.Sadly, this is only the beginning, as Bond (Pierce Brosnan) from there traverses a series of all-too-easy break-ins, break-outs, and villain encounters that probably could have been left on the cutting room floor without losing any plot.  But, of course, they have to fill two hours, so there they remain.  It degrades into a 90 minute pyrotechnics fest with the final battle being your cliched race-against-the-clock villain-gets-maimed-in-the-end type of ending.There's nothing of meaning once you get past the first plot point.  Bond's relationship with Paris Carver (Teri Thatcher) seems to have been thrown in for no reason other than to give Elliot Carver (Pryce) a reason to go after him.  Carver's cronies (until the final scene) are bumbling and far too easily removed.  And despite the supposed time bomb waiting to explode in the South China Sea, you never actually feel any sense of danger or urgency in the situation.  The movie just merrily floats along to its cliched climax.This movie is all the fault of bad writing and a total lack of plot.  They tried much too hard to create a good story and ended up ruining it by losing focus and coherence.  Of course, they put on a good enough show that you probably won't notice until the end, which leaves you wondering where the second tape is to fill in all the plot holes.  Or, if you watch a lot of films like myself, you've noticed it long before and you've given up on this completely contrived story.  I could make a lot of suggestions that would keep the same general plot but dramatically improve the flow and enjoyment of this story.  But it's obviously much too late for that.In contrast, the actors' performances are solid, enjoyable, and true to their roles.  I still think Pierce Brosnan has a lot of promise as Bond, but sadly, he doesn't get much of a chance to shine in this movie thanks to the script.  The other characters suffer equally.Also, David Arnold has produced yet another stellar musical score, easily on par with his (John) Williamsesque ""Stargate"" and ""Independence Day"" scores, but with its own unique style that mixes symphony and synth with an old school Bond sound.  Unfortunately, you can't hear it most of it over all the explosions and gunfire.  If you appreciate movie soundtracks or Bond at all it'll be worth your $15 to get the soundtrack from this film.But those good points aren't nearly enough to make up for the script.  I'm glad this was only a 99-cent rental.  I would have rather watched Goldeneye again.Rating: 4/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
278,David007,Excellent Bond thriller lacks originality.,9,9 September 1998,"TOMORROW NEVER DIES has many very good aspects: acting, direction, music, production design..., making it an excellent Bond thriller. Pierce Brosnan is definitely the new James Bond; Michelle Yeoh is a feminine Bond while Teri Hatcher is beautifully romantic and sad. Jonathan Pryce could have been a more threatening baddie (his intentions are frightening but I barely saw him being dangerous onscreen) but his team is convincing. David Arnold is not John Barry but his music is appropriate and efficient. And Roger Spottiswoode directs skillfully.The main flaw I noticed in TOMORROW NEVER DIES was its lack of originality: almost any scene, any situation, seems to be directly inspired by an analogous scene or situation in a previous Bond movie: the breathtaking precredits sequences looks like that of OCTOPUSSY; the underwater scenes reminded me of those from THUNDERBALL or FOR YOUR EYES ONLY; the final scenes onboard the ship come from THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (etc, etc)...

282,Glucojel,"A Pile of Style, but Substance in Absence.",1,20 November 2006,"After one of the best, if not the very best opening sequence of all the post-Moore Bonds (with high risk, plenty of action, and a mistake Bond has to clear up to save the day, Tomorrow Never Dies degenerates into easily the least polished and most 'style over substance' of the Bonds. I think it's the worst of the lot and even now it's the only Bond I find physically hard to get through.Bond stunts have always been outlandish, but they were always meant to be possible, hence the use of real stunt men. Tilting a helicopter 70 degrees and chopping up a marketplace while hovering and not actually wrecking the blades, cartwheeling into a building, or accelerating forward out of control is not even nearly possible. It actually suggests that helicopters hover of their own free will and the blades are just there for show and to chop crap up. That doesn't make a cool stunt- that makes an insulting farce.One of Bond's mantra's has always been 'I work alone.' Kudos to the screenwriters for including a bond girl who can stand up for herself, but why show it through Bond going completely out of character and seeking her help, only for her to spit Bond's own line back at him? That doesn't make sense at all. That doesn't seem like Bond at all.There are other goofs that are so simple a child could spot them, yet they went unnoticed into the final version. Things like the torpedo having three giant interlocking gears- something else which is impossible- and a watercraft that looks streamlined and like a thin inverted 'U' on the outside, but on the inside somehow looks like a very large, very cube-like warehouse. The fact that the giant paper poster barely stops ripping under Bond and Lin's combined falling weight, yet holds fast as they recklessly flit back and forth to smash a window. Chains that hold fast while Bond somehow transfers breathable oxygen to Lin in a smooch, but part effortlessly once the point has been made. The way a seemingly insignificant single console in a dimly lit hallway will, when shot with a single burst, dramatically reduce the speed of the entire ship.Even at the very start, with a ballistic missile bearing down on Bond as he taxis a jet packing a nuclear warhead away from soldiers with illegal weapons of all sorts lying around to be used, not to mention a gattling gun mounted truck blasting away at him constantly, he still takes the time to run the plane all the way down the runway, turn around, and be surprised that there's another jet there waiting to take off in the opposite direction. Sure, he might have done that to make sure he took off into the wind, but it's hardly something you worry about when you're about to be incinerated, and besides, the other guy takes his plane off in the other direction and gets up fine, which demonstrates another character faux-pas for Bond: The reason he survives all his stunts and chases is because he -like any self respecting action hero- has a keenly developed sense of what can be achieved with what he's got, when he's got it. The only reason he wouldn't have taken off straight away is if he didn't think he'd make it. The other pilot did. Already that gives some nobody shmuck a keener instinct than Bond.All they had to do was make some truck block the runway entrance, forcing Bond to go to the other end, and everything would have made perfect sense. The way they did it, it seems like Bond's watch must have frozen, so he decided to take his sweet time getting out of a potential nuclear ground zero. Way to go, Bond. Don't forget your receipt.They would have made it a much better story by just including the pre-credit sequence, the car park chase and maybe the newspaper plant investigating scene and throwing the rest out.The series just got more convoluted in TWINE. I'm glad they at least brought a bit of fun back in with DAD. It's ten times the movie this pile of crud is. For first-time watchers, when you get to the opening credit song, switch it off.

A megalomaniacal media mogul tries to start a war to boost the circulation of his various enterprises. Jonathan Pryce is a little too over-the-top in his portrayal of Eliot Carver and Teri Hatcher has little chemistry with Brosnan. Michele Yeoh is about the only bright spot in this dismal production.

We've seen this at least 3 times before, and I think James Bond must think there's a conspiracy theory against him or something.)CHARACTERS - James Bond, the suave, sexy secret agent (immortal by the looks of it too); Wai Lin, his tough, PC sidekick (has a pretty good pair too); Elliot Carver, mad, ruthless, delusional, low IQ (thinks he can kill Bond); M, James Bond's commanding officer, always finds James Bond annoying; Stamper, a cut-down Hans (remember Hans - he's the big, blonde, muscular, silent, Nordic bloke who James Bond had a little tiff with near the end of You Only Live Twice).PRE-CREDIT SEQUENCE - James Bond rudely interrupts a terrorist bring-and-buy sale. (Pierce Brosnan is the only person who gives a good performance here, Judy Dench is quite bad and everyone else is bad!)JOKES - the first joke: bad. And they just get worse, until, finally we think we've heard them all and at the end Bond makes the worst pun ever.Q - James Bond's scenes with him are the only ones worth watching.Oh I give up. Just don't watch this. Better was yet to come.",Tomorrow Never Dies
285,john-597,Absolutely NO style at all,5,15 June 2000,"This, the second Bond film to star Pierce Brosnan, is where the Lethal Weapon-style excess really gets out of hand. Obviously in updating Bond for the '90s they forgot about Bond's Martini-swilling, licence-to-kill persona and all we're left with is some Schwarzenegger-type mercilessly machine-gunning his foes. I hear critics and Bond purists echoing the chorus of ""best Bond since Connery"" everywhere I look but ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" bears absolutely no relation to those great films. The plot is lifted directly from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and, let's face it, Wai Lin was a joke, because Bond girls are not meant to be kung fu'sters who can overshadow the great 007. Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) is not a classic example of a main villain (Randolph Hearst wreaking world havoc?). The only things I liked about this film were Bond's BMW and Dr. Kaufmann (Vincent Schiavelli). Thankfully, the producers put the style back into Bond in his latest film, ""The World Is Not Enough"".",Tomorrow Never Dies
286,beatlebass-40957,An extremely underrated Bond film that has aged well.,8,20 June 2020,"Tomorrow Never Dies has a lot going for it, and for me is an easy thumbs up in the Bond catalog.Brosnan is really good in this one, pulling off both darker more gritty moments (his scene with the assassin in the hotel room is one of my favorites) and classic Brosnan-era one liners.Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin is fantastic as a Bond girl who can more than hold her own.Jonathan Pryce as Eliot Carver is a great Bond villain, and his plot is definitely more unique than most Bond films. In the era of ""fake news"" this film seems to almost be ahead of it's time.The film features two solid action sequences that are almost polar opposite of each other. In one Bond and Lin are handcuffed to each other while riding a motorcycle, and in the other Bond controls his car via a cellphone and has to escape a parking garage. One takes place out in the open and the other in a more cramped location, providing a nice contrast between the two.The secondary characters are solid as well, and at only two hours the film never seems to drag. Overall a very solid outing in the franchise and one that feels even more relevant as time moves on.",Tomorrow Never Dies
287,patrick-west10,A film of 2 halves,6,5 November 2011,"Tomorrow never dies is a follow up to one of my favourite bond films which is Golden-eye. The film starts terrific, we are given and explosive opening action sequence, followed by some scenes setting up the plot and then BANG. We are given some great action scenes resembling which looks to set up the perfect bond film. The car chase scene with is remote controlled BMW was amazing and arguably the best car chase in bond history.However then the film just fall flat. Unfortunately Elliot Carver isn't a very interesting Bond villain and the action, while good, isn't exciting anymore because its all too similar to the ones before.Overall Tomorrow Never Dies is a good Bond film (for the first half) but then falls flat.My final rating 6.5/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
288,jhathawaywilson,One of the best Bond films there is!,8,26 April 2014,"Over the past few weeks I have been watching all the different James Bond films. Now, after having watched them all, Tomorrow Never Dies was probably one of the best. It had brilliant characters and a neat, simple storyline. However, for some reason, it did not reach the critics expectations.In my opinion, this film was not much different from the others in the franchise. It was humorous, action-packed, and best of all, entertaining. It may not have been as successful as the previous Bond film, Goldeneye. Nevertheless, this does not make it a bad film. It has a perfect Bond actor, (Pierce Brosnan) a good choice of actor for M and Q, (Judi Dench and Desmond Llewelyn) and an excellent James Bond villain, Elliott Carver, a partially mad media mogul. There were a few changes that made it not quite to Bond the story line, for example the Bond girl was a fighter which you don't see to often in the series, but that wasn't a bad change! After all, if you put that out the way it pretty much follows the bond storyline: Starts with action, has a mad villain, and ends with the villain dying in some unusual way (razored by a bladed drill.) The movie line itself was fairly simple but not bad. The insane media mogul, Elliot Carver, is planning to create a war between China and the UK. He's doing this by destroying one nations property and making it look like it was done by the other nation. To do this he's also having to use some lethal and bizarre weaponry. Bond is sent out to stop Carver with the help of Chinese agent, Wai Lin.So, over all, it's up to you whether you watch Tomorrow Never Dies. But if you take my word for it, don't trust the critics. You won't regret watching this film. Alan Hathaway",Tomorrow Never Dies
289,DaveBond007,Can the success continue?,10,6 February 2009,"After the tremendous success of Goldeneye, could the producers continue moving the franchise in the right direction? YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT! Just when you thought Goldeneye delivered all the excitement and true essence of BOND you could have ever hoped for, we get something that, depending on your tastes, is far more exciting than its predecessor. WE get Tomorrow Never Dies. Pierce plays the role far more confidently in this film, and it shows. This film has so many great moments, It's really hard not to list them here. Bond's BMW is unbelievable! The cast is excellent and there's a cool aura surrounding this film. From the cleverly placed Bond theme, to the traditions you've grown to love, its hard not to enjoy yourself while watching this film. The Brosnan Era was a golden age for the franchise. Each film gave us something new. Something grand. Never cheap on Action, excitement, suspense, humor, or beautiful ladies, these films are the representation of what makes JAMES BOND the icon he is today. The all important fun factor is on full throttle here, and honestly, what's missing in the new films.",Tomorrow Never Dies
290,dr_saaron,One of the best since early Connery,9,22 November 1999,"Pierce Brosnan is the best film Bond overall since the glory days of the early Sean Connery films.  He brings the best contributions of all three major screen versions--the physical toughness of Connery, the wit of Moore, and the coldness of Dalton--to the screen.  Like Connery, he is believable as someone who could kick your butt.  When someone close to him is killed, his Bond will take revenge as coldly and hatefully as Dalton's.For this film, Brosnan has a firm grasp of his vision of Bond, and so do the writers.  The writing is sharp, the best since ""Goldfinger.""  The pacing is consistent, and the film never slows down.  Brosnan's Bond probably fires more bullets in one minute of this film than Connery's did in 6 films combined.  Despite that, the action sequences are exciting and well directed.The best part of the film was the decision to have a ""Bond girl"" who functioned as a work partner for Bond, not just a bed partner.  Michelle Kwan is one of the best Bond girls, because she is an equal to Bond and her character could star in a film series as easily as he can.",Tomorrow Never Dies
291,eliesherman,Ahead of it's time,8,6 December 2020,"You cannot deny this Bond film, made in '97, was prescient concerning the power of media to shape global affairs. Was just a bit off with the media mogul being into print instead of the Internet. Add to that a wicked sense of humour and excellent performances. Schiavelli was hilarious as Dr Kaufman. A smart script with lots of innuendo. Not to mention, one of the first Bond films to embrace diversity. Underrated, in my opinion. I think the new Bond movies could use more humour again.",Tomorrow Never Dies
292,DarkMoon72,If there's nothing else to watch...watch something else.,3,17 March 2002,"When I watched Tomorrow Never Dies, I wondered to myself if this was James Bond or Rambo. Why did they try to cram so many action scenes into this movie? Hardly 10 minutes goes by without someone getting blown up or shot. James Bond is supposed to be about subtlety and class, wit and grace, not grabbing machine guns and shooting everything and everybody.WARNING: This post contains spoilers!In the opening sequence, a British Admiral fires a cruise missile at a terrorist camp in Afghanistan (!). Soon afterwards, he realizes that one of the planes in the camp is armed with nuclear weapons, and the cruise missile cannot be destroyed. Can Bond, who is in the camp, find an interesting and clever way to escape, and stop the nukes from exploding? The answer is: no. What does he do? He grabs the nearest automatic weapon, heads for the plane, and kills almost everybody (making the cruise missile useless), jumps into the cockpit, and flies away with the missiles. Pierce Brosnan, who looks at home playing baccarat in a Monte Carlo casino, has his talents wasted in this movie as he turns into a philandering Rambo.Not to mention the whole plot is ridiculous. Someone's going to start World War Three over a newspaper? Wow. He'll make some more money. He's already obviously fantastically rich already, so it becomes a Goldfinger-type plot where we wonder why he does what he does, because no motive is given. If he was going bankrupt or something, that would've been a little better, but as it stands, there's no strong reason for him to want to nuke Beijing!In the same vein, the whole concept of starting World War 3 has been done to death (pay no attention to the bald man with the Persian cat), and not only that, it isn't even done well this time around. Tensions between China and Britain weren't especially high when his movie came out, so starting a war between them wouldn't be very believable. On top of that, both countries obviously know that they are being set up (since they've sent Bond and Wai Lin out to investigate), so once Bond and Wai Lin report back (which could've been done before they jumped onto Carver's ""stealth boat""), wouldn't everybody know that the jig is up?Given that Eliot Carver is a pretty empty and shallow character, Jonathan Pryce overacts way too much, almost to Shatnerian proportions. It's cool to watch him make speeches with this glazed look on his face, and to watch him mutter ""delicious"" whenever something goes his way, but other than that, the character of Eliot Carver is pretty stale.Wai Lin is also a flawed character, it seems that the writers couldn't decide whether she was supposed to be a tough, independent woman or a hopeless, frail Bond bimbo (much like Tiffany Case). Towards the end, she seems to depend on Bond for her survival from one minute to the next.To top it off, there's Jack Wade. Not even he knows what he's doing in this film.While this isn't the worst Bond movie, it is pretty awful, and I really did find the first draft of the script to be a much more believable and well-written story. There are many Bond movies that are remakes - this is a remake of The Spy Who Loved Me (which is itself a remake).",Tomorrow Never Dies
293,pimpscorpion,Greatest Bond Film,9,7 January 2004,"This film was by far the most clever of all the bond movies, including Goldfinger and R. No and the early ones.  Also, this movie is not based on a book.  I was very entertained by this movie, especially the big action scenes (the sequence with Michelle Yeoh and Pierce Brosnan handcuffed is one of my all-time favorite chase scenes, and the parking garage scene too). This movie definitely deserves more credit than what it has.  What a fun movie!  See immediately if haven't already.",Tomorrow Never Dies
294,MuppetThumper,Worst Bond film of the modern era,5,15 March 2004,"Coming on the back of Goldeneye, a fine film by any standards and Brosnan's best as 007, Tomorrow Never Dies was a complete dud. For once blame cannot be laid on the plot - which on paper is perfectly acceptable for a Bond film. But thin supporting characters (especially the villains) and poor direction for the majority of the film (bar some good action sequences) mean this effort is nowhere near the usual Bond Standard. Most problematic of all however, and the real reason behind the sour taste this film leaves behind, is the movie's ending. The representation of the 'stealth ship' was dreadful, even now I wince when I think of the tacky model they used. Worse still was how 007 stormed it like Rambo with guns a-blazing.When did James Bond become a gun-clip emptying, body-count embracing generic character stereotype? This is not the way Her Majesty's ""secret-agent"" should act! In the Connery, Moore and even Dalton eras, Bond usually had help from a bunch of anonymous 'good guys' when the crunch battle arrived - a far more believeable, entertaining and traditional way to signoff a 007 movie.",Tomorrow Never Dies
295,98nurdinm,Spoilers,10,15 July 2004,"WARNING: There may be some spoilers in this review!As a die-hard Bond fan i am often criticised about the choice of my favourite Bond film ever. Some will say 'Dr. No', and then there are others who claim that 'Goldfinger' is the best. However as far as i am concerned, this is the best Bond film. This does get lot of stick from many fans and critics, but i will try and place all the really good points within this review.Firstly, Brosnan is far more at home in this movie in the role of Bond then in 'GoldenEye'.Secondly, Jonathan Pryce is fantastic as the villain. This is a new type of baddie for the Bond series, and is a very clever character. Pryce plays it well in all of the scenes, whether he is Bwa-ha-haing down Bond's ear or ordering the execution of his wife.Thirdly, Teri Hatcher is wonderfully tragic as Paris Carver, the doomed sacrificial lamb of the film, and also very attractive. The scenes between her and Bond are also very well written and shot.Fouthly, the music. David Arnold does a good job in scoring the film in a very John Barry style, starting with Classic Bond, followed by Techno Bond, and finally by Asian Bond.Fiftly, the final shoot-em-up on the Stealth Boat is exciting and memorable. The action is well-filmed, and the final deaths of Carver and his German heavy, Stamper, justly disgusting!There are a few minor problems. I'm not really a big fan of Michelle Yeoh, though she does kick bottom in several scenes. Joe Don Baker's character, though funny in 'GoldenEye', is not really necessary in this film. Finally, maybe there is a bit too much action in the last few moments of the film.Still, this is a worthy and brilliant entry in the series, and my favourite of all!!9/10",Tomorrow Never Dies
296,martybc3-162-209801,This is a great movie!,9,28 November 2018,"This movie was ahead of its time, it's mainly about how the media can lead to terrible things!

Not much action as some bond flicks but it's a great movie.",Tomorrow Never Dies
297,agustin11,4.5; a strong Brosnan outing,8,10 September 2009,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" in a strange way feels like that ""other"" Bond movie since to many people, the first 90's revival film, ""Goldeneye"", was very well-received and brought a classic Nintendo 64 game with it. This film, Pierce Brosnan's second outing, is a bit more stronger in terms of pacing and its action sequences though it doesn't have that reverence the previous film did which is a shame. Sure there's some elements, like all Bond films, which don't quite make it perfect, it's got plenty of bullets, quips and babes for any Bond lover to be entertained by. A British naval ship, the Devonshire, had drifted too close to Chinese waters and the event leads the Devonshire sunk and a Chinese fighter destroyed. But a third ship, a stealth ship owned by media mogul Elliot Carver, used technology to fool both sides and the result creates a possible start to World War III. 007 James Bond is sent in to investigate Carver's plans and with the help of Carver's wife Paris (and an old flame of Bond's) and Wai Lin, a Chinese agent, Bond tries to stop 2 powerful governments from declaring war on each other. I'm going to get the negatives out of the way so it doesn't sound like I'm complaining too much. For one, the lack of a strong villain kind of hurts the film and though we have acclaimed actor Jonathan Pryce (""Brazil"") playing the role, he seems more like a man behind the scenes playing with toys than a threat. And the plot isn't exactly new and Carver's whole reason for doing it is kind of ""...wha?"". However, this film has some of the best action sequences of the Brosnan era, from the pre-credit fighter jet scuffle, to Bond literally backseat driving as well as my favorite, when they drive up and all around a city on motorcycle. This scene is right up there with the tank chase in ""Goldeneye"" or the boat chase in ""World is Not Enough"". Acting-wise, there's not a whole lot to nitpick about, aside from the villains. Carver's muscle ""Mr. Stamper"" is kind of laughable and M. played by Judi Dench nearly loses her strong confidence she exerted last time but she's still a nice foil to have around. Brosnan, the fifth Bond, is starting to get more and more comfortable in his role which is sad since the series started to get more laughable and a bit silly but his charm and wit combined with handling the rifles and fight scenes works very well and special kudos to Michelle Yeoh for doing probably the best Bond girl. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", complete with one of the few Sheryl Crow songs I can tolerate, is probably the last good Bond before it went into decent-ish followups and I'd recommend checking it out.",Tomorrow Never Dies
298,nath-casey,The Bond film of Bond films!!!,10,13 January 2006,"I never knew the Sean Connery Bond. He was before my time. I grew up on Roger Moore and I will always remember those Bonds fondly. I know this will upset the Connery folk, but in my opinion Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond there will ever be. His look, his mannerisms, his delivery of those corny Bond witticisms, everything  Pierce Brosnan is the ultimate James Bond and 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is the ultimate Bond Movie.The opening scene is better than most action flicks' finales. There is just enough build up and plot development for the viewer not to get bored  coz when you go to a Bond film, you expect action from start to finish.The writers took the classic Bond formula and, without updating a thing, moved it into the 21st century. We have Jonathan Pryce as Eliot Carver, a media mogul with aspirations for World Domination. He has a child-like self-absorption and stubbornness.The henchman, Stamper, hasn't really got the eccentricity or charm of, say, Oddjob or Jaws, but this is made up by his mentor, Dr Kauffman (Vincent Schiavelli)  ""Mr Bond, I am a professional. I could shoot you from Stuttgart and still create the proper effect."" Unfortunately he is killed. I think this is a shame because I would have loved to see him as a regular in the franchise.Terri Hatcher is a memorable Bond girl, with a connection to Bond that gives him depth that is quite uncommon in these movies.There was a rumour that Michelle Yeoh (Wai Lin) would have a spin-off series (the same rumour was thrown around for what's-her-name is 'Die Another Day'). Her character, Wai Lin, is sexy, strong, and more than holds her own against Bond.The usual suspects are all here. Dame Judi Dench as M (please never leave us), Desmond Llewellyn as Q (may he rest in peace, and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny (God, she's sexy), all deliver Oscar worthy performances.The extras on the special edition DVD are good. The commentary is informative, but it is sorely lacking a 'Making Of', which is unfortunate. It is definitely worthy of anyone's collection no matter what their taste in movies.I regard this as the best Bond movie so far. If you've never seen a Bond film before (where have you been) this is the one to start with. It is the Bond film all Bond films should be measured against.",Tomorrow Never Dies
299,Clarkey,great film,8,1 August 1998,"After seeing the Jackal last week, and hating it I went to see Tomorrow never dies as you can usually rely on the bond films bringing you two hours of good action.  That's exactly what you get with this latest edition and more.  The stunts are absolutely incredible, the acting is good and the BMW car can do just about anything.  The only down side, if you could call it that is the story line was a bit far fetched.  As for everything else though, no complaints.  I though Pierce Brosnan has grown in the bond role and play's the part superbly, and will definitely not be replaced for the next film.  Anyway to the plot.  A British boat is sank off the coast of China while in international waters, or so they think.  Actually someone had tampered with the satellites and the British boat was actually in Chinese waters.  While the Chinese were threatening to fire at the ship an invisible stealth boat under the command of media tycoon Jonathan Pryce fired at the British ship so they would think that the Chinese had done it, retaliate and therefore world war three would break out.  Your asking yourself what would someone want to create WW3.  Well it's simple enough.  He has the newspaper rights to every country in the world, except China who will not sign.  So by creating WW3 China will be turmoil and he can bring in his own leader, General Chang who he has as a deal with to head China and get the newspaper rights for the next hundred years.  Some people are never satisfied.  So M played by Judy Dench is given forty eight hours to investigate what is going on, by sending in 007.  He goes from place to place causing havoc wherever he goes and along the way teams up with a women from the chinese national party (Michelle Yeoh), who also has the same objective, to stop WW3.  Teri Hatcher (superman ) plays a small part as Jonathan Pryce's wife and an old friend of 007. This film will keep you glued to your seats for two hours guaranteed.  I give this film an EIGHT out of ten.",Tomorrow Never Dies

Mr. Brosnan is in perfect form filling the role easily.  It has more action than emotion but that doesn't make it a bad movie.  In fact it makes it a very fun movie. Jonathan Pryce plays a great villain along with Gotz Otto who is a very memorable goon-villain.  Teri Hatcher and Michelle Yeoh are sexy and beautiful Bond babes who each fill a different role that makes the movie fun.

Fast cut to Bond and the 'Bond girl you didn't think would be the Bond girl' bed time scene. End credits.What the hell?Its almost as if the first half of the film was properly thought out and shot, then the second half was just rapidly put together because nobody knew how to end it properly.

Bar the BMW 750il chase scene which is really well done. I seem to recall Brosnans next outings as Bond are mainly full of one liner fluff and nonsense even more absurd than this one.

First of all the film just didn't have much of the hilarious humor in the other Bond films.  Through most the film James Bond was being boring rather than humorous.  Don't get me wrong, he still said some of your average bond things but just not enough as the other Bond films. Much of the reason on why the Bond films shine is because of the bond girls.  They usually bring a shine to the story but sadly Michelle Yeoh plays a boring Bond girl while Teri Hatcher plays a bond girl who can't act and is barely in it.  Teri Hatcher plays the role of the ""evil"" bond girl but she isn't evil.  Neither Bond girl in this film is mysterious nor vibrant which really made this movie bad. There are a few very interesting action scenes but that is about all to mention.

306,lostfreeeak,Tomorrow Never Dies - Brilliant Bond Film,8,22 December 2008,"I only watched this bond film for the first time very recently, and i must say, my feelings to actually initiating viewing the film were mixed. these mixed feelings were caused by the rather horrible the World is not Enough, and Quantum of Solace which was just a major disappointment in all respects. But then there was the captivating and thrilling Golden Eye and Casino Royale which ushered in the new James Bond with a sense of all encompassing coolness. and now Tomorrow never dies. i took a gamble with this film and it really payed off. Tomorrow Never Dies is thrilling, very, very funny at times and the Brosnan bond is at his very best. Most of the supporting actors/actresses were top notch, and the directing spot on. One aspect of this film is the Bond gadgetry used. It must be said that bond gadgets were not used very frequently in Golden Eye, which may have been a good thing ,it helped put more focus on the thrilling plot and bond himself. In Tomorrow Never Dies, one does get the impression that there is a focus on gadgets, which is welcome, the gadgets aid the plot with creating a sense of a truly super cool bond.Another aspect that must be mentioned is the humor. From all the other bond movies i have seen, maybe its just me, but i got the distinct impression that bond has no sense of humor. That was one of the biggest surprises when i first viewed this film. Humor in some action films, however, can take away the action and the thrilling suspense. In Tomorrow Never Dies, however, the humor emphasizes that bond is very cool.This movie is Bond at his most brilliant . If you haven't seen it, watch it.

Much of the fault lies with a dreary implausible villain which seems to be the writers' thinly veiled attack on Rupert Murdoch. A media tycoon does not make a very good Bond adversary at the best of times, but here is so lazily written (and acted) as to suck any potential out of the character whatsoever. The usual Bond formula of beautiful locations, beautiful girls is eschewed too; here we have a brief fling with Teri Hatchett but the main female interest is Michelle Yeoh, a woman more of Chinese efficiency than sex appeal.

310,djrexx,"Not a classic Bond, but still amazing!",8,10 November 1999,"First things first, if your into classic Bond movies (Goldeneye, From Russia With Love, etc.) you won't give this movie more then an 8/10 at best. Tomorrow Never Dies isn't a classic Bond, but still worth watching. From the stunts, to the gadgets to Teri Hatcher! This was a good movie to make to start a new, more modern breed of James Bond fans. Pierce Brosnan, once again, has a brilliant performance in Tomorrow Never Dies. You just can't stop this man, he's on a role. But yet again, I am worried that he will be permanently labeled as James Bond for the rest of his life, and the people will not give this man a chance to be something else other then 007. With just one more James Bond to go for Pierce Brosnan (After The World Is Not Enough), we'll see what happens.",Tomorrow Never Dies
311,cymon-2,Bond is back!!!!,7,10 October 2000,"After ""Goldeneye"" I thought that Bond was dead. I thought that a character that is on the screen since '60s can be a little too tired for saving the world. Now, after ""Tomorrow never dies"" I have my hero back! The greatest spy of the world in this movie have the power, the charme, the technology and the abilities that he need! There's an evil bad character with an absurd and great plot to conquer the world, there're a lot of action scenes very well made and everything is mixed up with the right logic and cleverness. A good movie of 007, the best of the last 10 years.",Tomorrow Never Dies
312,whalesdonthavenipples,Brosnan's most atmospheric bond film,7,18 June 2007,"I think this is Brosnan's best, purely because it is so easy to immerse yourself in the brilliantly crafted atmosphere. The stunning colours and action sequences used make this film stand out from his previous (and later) attempts at being Bond. His debut with Goldeneye gave a sour aftertaste as this, and The World Is Not Enough, are both more monochromatic in a sense. There is a more depressing aura to them. His role in Die Another Day was bizarre and focused on nothing more than CGI and refined camera shots which lose the gritty Bond charm that makes Tomorrow Never Dies so brilliant.The dialogue is great in this film as are the action sequences (especially with the remote controlled BMW and the motorbike sequence). These action sequences are quintessential Bond and do not just seem to be a vehicle to create 'action'. It is all done brilliantly. There are also a few funny moments, such as the scenes with Dr Kauffman and the film has a great musical score.I think the only thing missing from this film is the classic Bond girl. Of course, Teri Hatcher was a great choice but I felt her character was a little off, and almost created simply to fuel a little more anger towards the protagonist, who is classically clichéd. Michelle Yeoh was a relatively good choice for her role, but this new edge to the butt-kicking Bond girl also caused problems for me.Still, this is by far Brosnan's best Bond performance with an original and believable (well more believable than Die Another Day anyway) plot.",Tomorrow Never Dies
313,nialljames,Good but forgettable,7,7 September 2015,"Tomorrow Never Dies is a good Bond film but at the same time a forgettable Bond film. The biggest positive of the film is that it sticks to the minimum and doesn't commit to anything too excessive like Skyfall. The plot is straight-forward and easy to follow, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the film without having to overthink or discuss every minute detail. Action scenes are not absurd nor are they stretched out and tiring. Tomorrow Never Dies is one of those films where you just sit back and enjoy the action without having to overthink. However, because of the simplicity of the plot, the film is also forgettable.",Tomorrow Never Dies
314,mr_pink89,"Smart idea, dumb execution.",5,17 January 2021,"This movie idea of creating it's own fake news to sell more papers is smart at the ground level but as soon as they try to lift of it is oh so dumb. The focus should have been a classic spy movie where Bond has to be smart, witty and calculating but instead it's just big set pieces that doesn't care about the story but instead about it looking as cool as possible, which sure worked when it came out but hasn't aged that well the last +20 years.The movie is also way too gadget focused and one of the better action scenes (the car park scene) becomes hilariously dumb because of it, and that scene pretty much sums up the movie. It's spectacular but dumb, and a wasted opportunity to continue on the cold calculating Bond that they focused on in GoldenEye who put the mission first and everything else second. It's a fun ride but in the end you won't remember much from it.",Tomorrow Never Dies

316,P.Dexter,Rolercoaster Bond,7,8 September 1999,"Not bad for a Bond, though I thought that Brosnan did a better job in GoldenEye. Problem with this film is that there's no time for any groundwork. Once you are in the rolercoaster, there's no exploring or talking, you just sit back 'till the ride is over. The writers touch upon the fact that being a secret agent is a lonely job, but they've could have give it more thought and work it out a bit more. But nonetheless, not bad.P.",Tomorrow Never Dies
317,Bangus,DVD (Special Edition Review),10,22 December 1999,"After viewing the TND special Edition DVD, I can honestly say this is the best overall DVD to date. The disk is packed with extras...Trailers, Sheryl Crow Video, Gadgets, Bond historical movie and of course the feature film in a variety of formats. The interface of controls is also a special treat. The movie gets an 8/10...for Bond fans and action fans alike. A must have in everyone's library. On the whole 10/10 well worth the extra money. *** A great choice for Demo'ing a home theatre***",Tomorrow Never Dies
318,adapt_robot_lab,Great movie,8,4 April 2006,"Just one quick comment.What is this with some of you commenting that ""the bond girl has to be equal than bond""??? For all that don't know, James Bond is the epitome of MACHISM. And that is a GOOD THING. He is the MAN and doesn't need any PC director or writer to come and make ""female equals"" to him. Just remember how he finishes the first book ""Casino Royale"".Other than that Wai Lin was wonderful. Strong but in the end still a girl to fall into Bonds arms.And I have to say that this is the best of Brosnan movies. The locations are good but I would have like to see a little longer finale with Bond just relaxing and enjoying the hot Chinese Colonel",Tomorrow Never Dies
319,tauroscorp,Best of Brosnan,8,25 October 2009,"Perhaps not the best Bond but the best of Pierce Brosnan. The story reminds me a bit of the 007 golden days in the cold-war, now the confrontation is not between West and Soviets but West and China but behind the whole thing is the crazy media-mogul. The story is going smooth forward and the action is presence in a way it only can be in a Bond-movie. The characters are also quite good, especially the professional killer Dr. Kaufman is great and also hilarious. I think the Bond-girls are now a bit more in the background but it doesn't matter so much. Connery and Moore are the best Bonds but this is definitely Brosnan's best 007!",Tomorrow Never Dies

Pierce Brosnan really out does himself.this is yet another fantastic bond movie with all of the thrills and action of the rest. pierce Bronson is drawing up to being as good as Sean Connery and roger Moore. i am however disappointed he didn't continue doing the bond movies. his witty lines and stupid actions make a great comedy/action film packed with everything.its guarantied to get you hooked onto the other movies. it is bonds 2nd best film next to die another day with Hallie berry.

322,Mogul-X,"Stylish, Fun and full of High-Octane Action!",7,9 April 2011,"I never really thought much of Tomorrow Never Dies the first time I watched it. At the time I had just seen GoldenEye the first Pierce Brosnan entry and the seventeenth bond film in total and I was totally blown away by it (and many repeat viewings followed). I had also fallen in love with the Nintendo 64 video game GoldenEye 007 and so when I got around to watching Tomorrow Never Dies I was quite disappointed.GoldenEye was the first Bond film I had ever seen and so I wasn't familiar with the on-going formula throughout the series. Where was Natalya? Where was Valentine? And where was Boris? (surely he survived being frozen?) ... I was a such a naive little kid. Needless to say I missed the characters from GoldenEye that didn't return and the story didn't engage me as much as GoldenEye's. I'm pretty sure I tuned out halfway through the film and went back to playing the Nintendo 64 video game.Many years later I picked up all the James Bond films on DVD and now a more mature individual I understood the Bond formula as I began to watch and discover the many other Bond films I hadn't seen. It was clearly time to re-evaluate Tomorrow Never Dies and not judging it as some direct sequel to GoldenEye which it is not (none of these films are after all).The story centers around ego-maniacal media baron Elliot Carver. Carver harnesses the power to reach every living person across the globe through his media group network - all except for the People's Republic of China who refuse to accept his presence in their country. Carver becomes tied to the disappearance of a British frigate in the South China Sea and James Bond is given 48 hours to investigate. Wai Lin a member of the People's External Security Force of China is also dispatched to investigate the growing crisis. With and without Wai Lin's help, Bond slowly uncovers a plot that goes all the way back to a mission on the Russian-Kazakh Border, and will ignite a war only to feed the fire that is Elliot Carver's ego.The story isn't as strong as GoldenEye which features themes of betrayal, revenge and post-cold war tensions and it's not the first Bond film to feature the familiar plot line of starting World War III (Thunderball and You Only Live Twice are prime examples). The script is weak and apparently went through many re-writes (script pages were supposedly being delivered to the set daily!) but it moves at a smooth enough pace that it doesn't detract from the film entirely.The filmmakers did a pretty darn good job of masking up the relative weakness of the script with some of the best action seen in the entire series. This is where the film most succeeds and where it is most entertaining. The film opens with a wonderful action sequence where Bond infiltrates a terrorist arms bazaar and hijacks a L-39 jet armed with Soviet nuclear torpedoes. Other highlights include a terrific car chase sequence in a parking-garage with possibly Bond's best-ever gadget-filled car; a shootout in a press-printing factory, a thrilling motorcycle chase through Saigon involving a helicopter, and the explosive finale aboard Carver's stealth ship should leave the viewer breathless.The film is directed by Roger Spottiswoode a director I am not familiar with nor have I seen any of his other work, however he does a pretty fine job here striking a balance between action, drama and classic comic 'Bond' moments. My favorite scene in the film (and one of mine in the entire series) is between Bond and an assassin named Dr. Kaufman in which Bond finds himself cornered into a trap in his hotel room, Spottiswoode does a wonderful job of showcasing the tension in this scene and we get to see the cold-blooded killer side of Bond which is not shown all too often throughout the series which is a shame given that is exactly what he is.Cast as Elliot Carver is Jonathan Pryce who plays him as the classic Bond-villain archetype - an over-the-top diabolical villain with world-dominating intentions. But he does a damn good job playing it that way and injects much color, humor and cunning into his performance and while not physically intimidating he is still stands as one of Bond's most dangerous enemies because of the power he holds. Michelle Yeoh plays Wai Lin but unfortunately the character doesn't come across as very interesting but she shares great chemistry with Brosnan and performs some wonderful martial arts skills. Teri Hatcher is mostly watchable as Carver's doomed wife Paris, I felt the character was wasted potential and should have been the main bond girl. Ricky Jay is also mostly wasted as the terrorist Henry Gupta; however Vincent Schiavelli shines in his cameo performance as Dr. Kaufman; Gotz Otto sleepwalks through his role as Carver's henchman Stamper (a villain crafted from the mold of Red Grant and Necros). Joe Don Baker, Judi Dench, Samantha Bond and Desmond Llewelyn reprise their GoldenEye roles.Overall Tomorrow Never Dies is a fun, thrilling, always entertaining, but if not a little by-the-numbers Bond flick. While it would have benefited from a stronger script I definitely feel overall that it is one of the stronger entries in the series and I always find myself going back to watch it simply because it achieves what it sets out to do and better than most Bond films: Explosive action, exotic locales, beautiful women and a menacing villain.",Tomorrow Never Dies
323,bryan7-1,Worst Bond Movie!,2,30 April 2004,"Am I the only one or is this one of the worst Bond movies, except for The man with the golden gun of course. First of all the plot line was stupid, I mean come on a media mogul starting a war for ratings! Is it just me or are the screenwriters running out of ideas. The locations were just awful, like China ,for instance, how many times have we seen Bond there. The story only took place in like three places: the arms bazaar, China and Hamburg. Also the Bond women were terrible especially Wai Lin. Did anyone else find her annoying, ""Don't get any ideas Mr. Bond."" Michelle Yeon is a terrible actress. There were hardly any gadgets except the car which was pretty cool except for the fact that the car was a family sedan! In the previous Bond movie he had a BMW Z3 sports car. But I think that the worst thing about this movie is that there are hardly any action sequences. A motorcycle chase and one man task force, how many times have we seen that in a Bond movie.
Please respond to my comment.",Tomorrow Never Dies
324,seponce19,Comments about the movie,8,29 April 2005,"I begin to watch the movies of Bond with Tomorrow Never Dies in 1997 and I think the movie is very exciting, the scenes are very explosives. The locations are interesting (Vietnam, Germany and Russia at the beginning of the movie). This movie has relation a little with Spy who loved me for these reasons: 1. The henchmen of these movies have in common are very dangerous (Mr. Jaws and Herr Stamper) and unstoppable. The difference is Mr. Jaws kill with his deathly iron teeth and the other guy Stamper kill with his guns. Stamper is more intelligent than Jaws.2. The final fight in both movies is inside a machine in the sea of course in Tomorrow is in the South China Sea and the other one is in the Adriatic Sea if I don't wrong.3. The main villain are mad men who want destroy the world but the villain of tomorrow Carver wants create chaos and war in order to having the right of broadcasting of the new of the war for 100 years and the other guy (Stromberg) is most direct because he wants to create a world around the sea.",Tomorrow Never Dies

326,vus_hwynn,it's so awful.,1,1 April 2006,"I am Vietnamese and have been in Vietnam for over 20 years but I don't think Vietnam looks like what they show in movie. It looks a lot like China or somewhere else to me. Saigon isn't that rich and dirty and small like some sense we see in movie. Also we don't have many Chinese signs or Chinese letters in Saigon, unless in Chinese town but Chinese town isn't like that either. Saigon looked big when Bond just arrived but when some bad guys were chasing him it looked so small and so dirty. And Vietnamese people don't always wear traditional custom and rice hat. Also we don't have a big tall building with a picture of some American hang on it. Can't believe that Vietnamese police let foreigners chasing on the street with machine guns and helicopter. I am not saying VN police are good, but it never happens in Vietnam at least for 50 years.",Tomorrow Never Dies
