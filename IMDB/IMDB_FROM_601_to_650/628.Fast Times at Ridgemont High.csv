0,MartinHafer,Socially irresponsible but well made.,6,5 October 2009,"If FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH had not been marketed so strongly to teenagers, perhaps I would have a very different opinion of the movie. After all, it is reasonably well made and has some interesting characters--particularly the guy played by Sean Penn. However, this movie was a ""hard R"" picture--with tons of very adult content that is inappropriate to teens--at least in the way they presented it. This is really a shame, as the lessons in the film are great material for teens to see and consider--they just didn't need to make the film so crude and explicit. For example, some scenes were simply added to ""sex up"" the film--such as Judge Reinholt masturbating to a fantasy in which Phoebe Cates takes off her bikini top. Did we really need to see this? But, some of the more adult content was interesting and would have made great material for teens--such as the girl (Stacy) who is so interested in keeping up with her friend as well as getting a boyfriend that she quickly puts out--and getting pregnant in the process. This is daring but real--a problem many young people face. Too bad the film didn't stick with these type topics, as sex and temptation are challenges teens face--like it or not. And, the girl getting pregnant is a realistic situation.So, if the film had kept 95% of its content and dropped the scenes of gratuitous sex, it would have been a GREAT teen film. But, sadly, the film was probably too teen-oriented for adults back in 1982 and too crude and irresponsible for teens (and by the way, what sort of parents thought it was good for the kids to go to this film?). Perhaps the only good audience are old folks like me who graduated in 1982--we can see the film and look back with nostalgia about the old days.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
1,SnoopyStyle,teen sex-romp with edge,9,1 April 2015,"It's teenage lives of the kids at Ridgemont High in California. Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a 15 year old virgin. Her best friend Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) pushes her to lose it. Stacy does it with older stereo salesman Ron. Her older brother Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) is a senior thinking he's got it all figured out. Rat Ratner (Brian Backer) is a shy kid infatuated with Stacy. His best friend is the fast-talking hustler Mike Damone (Robert Romanus). The kids work and hangout at the mall. They make out at the Point and talk about sex. Charles Jefferson (Forest Whitaker) is the football star. Teacher Mr. Hand (Ray Walston) and stoner surfer Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) are the standout side characters.This movie is a great teen sex-romp. It ushers in a new era of teen movies bringing a new edge to the genre. Cameron Crowe's writing is sharp and insightful. The music is amazing. It taps into a specific time and place. Amy Heckerling's directions are fresh. It also features the young faces of Eric Stoltz, Nicolas Cage and Anthony Edwards. It is simply the marriage of great writing, young up-and-coming stars and realistic edge. Modern movies would never have a teenage abortion. Not to mention that Phoebe Cates became teen sex goddess overnight.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
2,Prismark10,High school romancing,5,18 June 2016,"Fast Times at Ridgemont High now boasts three Oscar winners with Sean Penn, Forest Whitaker and Nicolas Cage in a blink and you will miss him role.The sweetest and brightest performance is by Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays Stacy who works in the fast food restaurants in a LA shopping mall talking with friend and co-worker Linda (Phoebe Cates) about sex and men.Mark (Brian Backer) fancies Stacy but when he goes out with her gets nervous. His friend a ticket tout Mike (Robert Romanus) who gives Mark lots of advice on women does get an opportunity to have sex with Stacy and gets her pregnant. It results in Stacy having an abortion.Stacy's brother Brad (Judge Reinhold) is having problems with his own girlfriend and also fantasises about Linda that results in an embarrassing situation in the bathroom. Brad also works in fast food but becomes increasingly irritated by the uniforms he has to wear.However the film is not about high school kids hanging about in malls or working fast food. It is about Ridgemont High, where wall to wall MOR music is played and all the girls give that 'come on' smile to the boys. In fact the entire film is women giving that kind of smile to men which is rather unrealistic. With the tits and ass on show in this film it comes as a surprise that the film was actually directed by a woman.The plot is flimsy, Stacy wants to lose her virginity but realises that she just needs a good friend. Brad goes through a succession of fast food jobs because in this recession hit Reagan's early 1980s USA where jobs are easy to come by. Mark and Mike try to resolve their differences over Stacy.The most interesting character is surfer dude and prototype Bill & Ted slacker Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) who has been permanently stoned for years and orders pizza while he is class. His relationship with Mr Hand brings some spark to the movie.The film bounces along because of the soundtrack, seeing some famous actors in early roles even though a few of them look too old to be still at high school. It is a fantasy version of a high school, I doubt even Hollywood High is like this.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
3,claudio_carvalho,For Teenagers Only,5,27 June 2015,"In California, at Ridgemont High, a group of teenagers are looking for something as part of discoveries in their lives: the pothead Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn), who is permanently stoned, dreams on becoming a great surfer in Hawaii. His history teacher Mr. Hand (Ray Walston) is giving hard time to him. The fifteen year-old virgin Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh) wants to have sex and her friend Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) is her mentor. Her brother Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) works at a fast-food and is paying for his Cadillac. He wants to break with his girlfriend Lisa (Amanda Wyss) now that he is senior to date other girls. The shy Mark 'Rat' Ratner (Brian Backer) is into Stacy and his friend Mike Damone (Robert Romanus) is his mentor. Along the semester, they have surprises and make discoveries about friendship and love.""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is a typical film for teenagers only; adults will certainly find it overrated, shallow and silly. The good points are the chance to see a generation of actors and actresses in the beginning of their careers. For example, this movie is the debut of Nicolas Coppola, a.k.a. Nicolas Cage with a brief participation. Another interesting point is how easy is to a fifteen year-old girl to have an induced abortion in a clinic; however, there is no message and the scene loses an opportunity to discuss a polemic theme. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Picardias Estudantis"" (""Knaveries from Students"")",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
4,mark.waltz,A nostalgic view of a bygone era I love to reminisce about but would never return to.,6,30 January 2019,"Everybody's teens and early twenties are fraught with wonder, worry and waking up to the realities of life. For a group of California high school students, life is one big long party that they hope will never end. Their senior year comes together in this enjoyable collection of individual stories where different personalities have different perspectives, and their situations are ones that teenagers of practically any generation can relate to. It's bittersweet, funny, touching and hopefully promising.There are big stars, minor celebrities, familiar character actors, flashes in the pan and a few surprises cast in smaller parts here, so this is a film that has nostalgia for many reasons. Is best known as the film that put Sean Penn on the map, and his role of Spicoli is certainly one of cult interest. In fact, he gets the best scenes in the film with an actor not even have his own generation, but a beloved TV star and stage actor from the 50's and 60's: Ray Walston. ""Are you people on dope?"", He exclaims in one of the film's funniest sequences, but his character of history teacher Mr. Hand is not your typical sour old man. He is a man of purpose and even if he doesn't always show it, he intends to make a dent in the life of Sean Penn's pot-smoking potential failure.it's a shame that Judge Reinhold never went on to great things in films because he is perfectly charming and likable, and next to Penn, the nearly most remember actor in the film. I felt his pain in dealing with a rude customer at the burger place where he explains to one trainee that the secret sauce is actually thousand island dressing, something I can relate to from a fast food restaurant that I worked at in Los Angeles in my early twenties.While Penn and Reinhold are the most familiar of the young male stars in leading parts, they do not really have romantic interest here. The two young women in the film are Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe Cates who went on to success but never became by their own choice a-listers. Reinhold deals with his lust for Cates in a very funny scene that has been often-repeated or ripped off. Leigh becomes torn between supposed friends Richard Romanus and Brian Backer, respectively playing a con artist in the making and his virginal innocent protege, ultimately with Romanus betraying Backer. it all culminates of course with the high school dance at the end of the school year where are all these situations dealt with are resolved comfortably in a short period of time.Of course, there's the great 80's atmosphere and that fabulous music that still hits the dance floors on retro nights today. You can Glimpse such future stars as Anthony Edwards, Nicolas Cage and Forest Whitaker in smaller roles, but my favorite minor part is soap actress Kelli Maroney as the peppy cheerleader who has to go off on the student body when they show no enthusiasm for her spirit.This really has no linear plot but a series of vignettes that are a combination of various emotions and gives modern young generations the opportunity to see the type of activities that their parents were involved in oh, something that teenagers of the early 80's hoped that their parents had lived and related to after the success of ""Grease"" just a few years before this. I can watch this and feel comfortable in the knowledge that teenagers don't change be on new trends and new styles, and perhaps it will help older generations continue to try and relate to the generations coming up.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
5,gavin6942,The First Great High School Movie?,8,14 July 2013,"A story of a group of California teenagers who enjoy malls, sex and rock n' roll.I watched this film many times when I was younger, never realizing how ground-breaking or risqué it was... we had taped it off the television and all the dirty bits were removed. Even when I eventually did see it in a fuller version, the abortion scenes (but not the nudity) were cut... wow.Is this an important film for the topics it covers? Yes. Is it important for the debut (or early) roles of many of its stars? Absolutely. But all around, it is just a brilliant look at teenage life in that time period, which probably has not changed all that much.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
6,lee_eisenberg,"Ah, high school...those were the days. Especially since everyone just might be stoned!",10,14 June 2006,"Sean Penn, Phoebe Cates, Forest Whitaker, and a very young Nicolas Cage all showed off their acting talents in the wacky ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", about several high school students and the various things going on in their lives. Probably the funniest scenes are what stoned surf dude Jeff Spicoli (Penn) does in stern Mr. Hand's (Ray Walston) class, but that scene where the one guy fantasizes about Linda Barrett (Cates) - resulting in an embarrassing situation - is also a hoot.All in all, this is one movie that will never get old, even if it did spawn a zillion imitations. I can guarantee that you're going to like it. I just wish that I could have experienced the whole thing. So let's party, dude!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
7,jboothmillard,Fast Times at Ridgemont High,8,12 September 2010,"National Lampoon's Animal House was a fantastic sex obsessed teen comedy, Porky's wasn't, and American Pie years later revamped it, and this one came in between, from writer Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire) and director Amy Heckerling (Clueless). Basically this film follows the students of a Southern Califonian high school, Ridgemont High, who go through all forms of insightful, sympathetic and of course funny growing up, or coming of age. So Stacy Hamilton (Road to Perdition's Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Mark 'Rat' Ratner (Brian Backer) are both looking for a love interest, Stacy has experienced friend Linda Barrett (Gremlins' Phoebe Cates) to help, and Rat has sleazy Mike Damone (Robert Romanus). Stacy's dorky senior student brother Brad Hamilton (Beverly Hills Cop's Judge Reinhold) is struggling to keep a job and also has deal with his girlfriend dumping him, but he picks himself up slowly. In the centre of all of this is constantly stoned surfer dude student Jeff Spicoli (young Sean Penn) is struggling to keep up with his studies, and has a little head on with history teacher Mr. Hand (Ray Walston), who thinks all students are on dope. The poignant moment in Stacy's story, besides practising giving a blow-job on a carrot, is when she and Mike have sex, and she ends up pregnant and needing money for an abortion, but Mike doesn't help at all. Rat of course finds out and gains to courage to stick up for himself, Linda is also very angry and punishes Mike with constant ""Prick"" abuse, don't worry, everything settles when it comes to the end of high school and the prom, oh, and Spicoli learns his lesson from Mr. Hand. In the end, Brad saves the day in his new job at the mini-mart, Mike is arrested for the flogging of tickets, odd teacher Mr. Vargas (Vincent Schiavelli) switches back to coffee, Linda attends college living with a doctor, Stacy and Rat are together having a love affair with no sex, Mr. Hand still thinks all students are on dope, and Spicoli saved Brooke Shields from drowning, but blew the reward money on getting Van Halen to play at his birthday party. Also starring Scott Thomson as Arnold, young Forest Whitaker as Charles Jefferson, Eric Stoltz as Stoner Bud, Anthony Edwards as Stoner Bud, and look out for young Nicolas Cage, then credited with the surname Coppola, being the nephew of Francis Ford, as Brad's Bud. At times is has the same style as American Pie with young people wanting to lose their virginity, but seeing the consequences of some of their decisions is much more dignified, and seeing all the then mostly unknowns doing it is really fun. The casting, especially Penn as the early Beavis and Butthead / Bill and Ted style incarnation, is fantastic, the situations presented are both there to make you laugh, and at times feel for the characters, so it is not just a typical teen comedy, it is certainly a must see. It was number 87 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Reinhold's daydream with Cates removing her red bikini bra coming out of the swimming pool. Very good!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
8,Woodyanders,An early 80's teen gem,9,14 June 2021,"The ups and downs of the lives of various teenagers attending Ridgemont High School in California over the course of a single frantic year.Director Amy Heckerling and writer Cameron Crowe present a perfectly judged mix of humor and drama. Moreover, Crowe's smart and astute script not only addresses the issue of teenage sex with consequences with refreshingly upfront candor, but also grounds the episodic narrative in an entirely plausible middleclass reality by showing the assorted kids actually working at their thankless minimum wage-paying jobs.Granted, the characters might very well be types, but they are still nonetheless believable and familiar people who we all knew in grade school: Eager virgin Stacy (a radiant portrayal by Jennifer Jason Leigh), her more seemingly worldly best gap pal Linda (Phoebe Cates at her most gorgeous and enchanting), happy-go-lucky senior Brad (likeable Judge Reinhold), shy nerd Mark Ratner (amiable Brian Backer), slick hustler Mike Damone (smoothly played by Robert Romanus), perky cheerleader Cindy (adorable Keli Maloney), and bumbling doofus Arnold (a nice turn by Scott Thomson). Sean Penn almost steals the whole show with his inspired performance as laid-back surfer stoner Jeff Spicoli, whose classroom altercations with strict history teacher Mr. Hand (a marvelously crusty Ray Walston) provide the movie's best and biggest laughs. It's also a treat to see such future stars as Forest Whitaker, Eric Stoltz, Anthony Edwards, and Nicolas Cage in small parts. Further galvanized by a choice bouncy soundtrack (the Cars, the Go Go's, Jimmy Buffett, Sammy Hagar, Joe Walsh, Stevie Nicks, and Jackson Browne amongst other notables), this simply delightful winner wholly deserves its cult classic status.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
9,BA_Harrison,The finest teen comedy ever!,10,31 January 2007,"Forget American Pie, Porky's and Animal House; with its brilliant script (by Cameron Crowe, based on his own book), spot-on direction from Amy Heckerling and an amazing destined-to-be-famous cast (spot Nicolas Cage, Anthony Edwards and Eric Stoltz in early performances), Fast Times At Ridgemont High is THE quintessential teen comedy.Following a group of students through a year of high school, this wonderful movie deals with the trials and tribulations of life as a teenager with a genuine affection for its characters. Crowe's sharp script handles delicate topics such as sex, drugs and finding employment without ever preaching to its audience, whilst still managing to be both touching and funny. Add brilliant performances from practically all involved and Fast Times is absolutely unmissable, especially for anyone who grew up in the 80s (the film is a great reminder of the decade that taste forgot: the soundtrack, the clothes, the video games, the hairstyles: everything about Fast Times oozes 80s styleor lack of it).Although, on the surface, the movie might seem rather aimless at times, meandering from one character to another at whim, there is a central story that runs through it all: Stacy (played by the very cute Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a teenager desperate to learn about sex and, guided by her (seemingly) more experienced friend, Linda (Phoebe Cates at her most gorgeous), she samples the delights of carnal love without a thought for the consequences. Enevitably winding up pregnant, she decides to get an abortion, but fails to get help from the irresponsible guy who knocked her up.Other minor story lines run parallel to Stacy's, but they mostly exist to provide light relief; Sean Penn's stoner surfer (surely the template for Keanu Reeve's entire career) constantly upsetting his teacher and Forest Whitaker's football star who believes that the rival team he is due to play trashed his car, provide some of the funnier moments.And of course no review of this film would be complete without a mention of possibly the greatest topless scene in movie history (OK, I may be slightly biased, since I'm a die-hard Phoebe Cates fan); Brad imagines Linda emerging from a swimming pool, popping off her bikini top and giving him a full-on lip lock. As far as I'm concerned, Fast Times is worth watching for this moment alone (although I find it slightly off-putting that Brad is busy jerkin' the gherkin during this scene!). And if that wasn't enough, Jennifer Jason Leigh joins in the fun and flips hers out during both of her sex scenes.A modern classic that is worth watching time and time again, Heckerling's movie is a surefire winner from start to finish. Now if only they would make a sequel (Ridgemont High School Reunion, perhaps) gathering together the original cast and crew (Phoebe Cates could come out of retirement for this, surely), I would be one very happy bunny.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
10,moonspinner55,About the embarrassments of being a teenager,6,15 March 2003,"What began life as an undercover writing assignment for enfant terrible Cameron Crowe (a baby-faced 20-something who went back to high school impersonating a student) becomes a surprisingly observant comedy about modern-day Southern California high schoolers, their after-class jobs and boy-girl relations. Early shot at the Sherman Oaks Galleria, with the camera scanning the rear-ends of the video-playing kids in their designer jeans, shows an almost-documentary feel for teen life. Director Amy Heckerling relishes these little throwaway moments, excelling with her attentive eyes and ears, but eventually the 'plot' kicks in...and the movie's satiric juice leaks out. The characters, while not stereotypes, are fairly one-dimensional. Heckerling keeps most of the talented young cast low-keyed, blasé, with only Sean Penn able to carve out a colorful impersonation of a perpetually-high surfer dude named Spicoli. These kids and their sexual foibles are almost made to look like bad examples until the celebratory finale, when everything ends happily. Phoebe Cates and Jennifer Jason Leigh create a relaxed, lived-in friendship that seems to go back a ways, and Judge Reinhold does fine work as a teenage veteran of fast food jobs. As the one adult we spend the most time with, Ray Walston acquits himself nicely as incredulous teacher Mr. Hand, who allows a pizza into his classroom but won't let the buyer, Spicoli, have a piece. Ah, the poetic justice of the oldster set!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
11,paul_haakonsen,A teenage comedy with an abundance of stars...,6,20 August 2021,"Oddly enough, then I haven't ever seen the 1982 comedy before now in 2021. In fact, I hadn't ever heard about the movie prior to now, as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch it.Actually, I didn't even look at who was in the movie, aside from seeing Sean Penn on the movie's cover. But it being a teenage comedy from early 1980s was sufficient to make me want to sit down and watch it.And as it turns out then ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", from writer Cameron Crowe and director Amy Heckerling was actually a rather enjoyable and feel-good movie. So yeah, I am happy that I stumbled upon this movie by random chance here in 2021.It should be said that the movie is crammed with an amazing cast ensemble. There are so many familiar faces in the movie, in bigger or smaller roles.""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is an enjoyable and archetypical 1980s teenage comedy. So if you enjoyed the movies of back then, then you'll certainly also enjoy this movie.I am rating ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" a six out of ten stars. This movie is well-worth the time and effort.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
12,Quinoa1984,Moving in stereo over a year,9,30 November 2017,"I watched little bits of this before, because it's impossible to be aware of pop culture and not see some of it (ie I Love the 80s on VH1 years back couldn't help but show scenes from this, or just flipping channels on cable), but never from start to finish. Thats over tonight. And damn if this doesn't have enough charm to charge up a mall during a holiday season. The entire cast is game and having a great time, and Heckerling is able to tap into that in such a way that shows how sleazy other teen comedies of the period were; it follows the Truffaut maxim of only wanting to see the joy or pain in making a film in the former sense. But I also think Ray Walston doesn't get quite enough credit here. Of course he's the old man in the cast, literally, since the bulk of them are ""kids"" relatively. As I watch Walston though, he finds the perfectly droll, bemused attitude to take when up against the students (""What are you people? On DOPE?"") and with Spicoli, who was the totally-method Sean Penn. I'm not sure if I saw the movie when I was much younger if he would be be as appealing; now in my 30s, I found him to be one of the funniest things in the whole thing.Jennifer Jason Leigh looks... So young. Which makes how her story turn out so wildly interesting and I love love LOVE how (spoiler) she deals with abortion as just another plot point. I cant think of other teen movies that would do that today, not to mention from a gaze that if it isn't identifiable female then it's certainly not male (take the scene where JJL loses loses her virginity and keeps looking at the scenery, is ""Surf Nazis""). It's a remarkable performance among remarkable and alive performances, all tapping in to the mood of the thing: high school is lame, but this guy or chick is cool! This really is one of the most influential movies of the past 40 years isn't it? Not necessarily *best*, but its commitment to anthropology - yes, anthropology - for the world of high school at this time is spellbinding. At the leasts its value is inestimable for giving us Freaks and Geeks.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
13,JohnHowardReid,The Re-Issue Version!,7,14 June 2016,"The 2009 re-issue version contains a number of scenes that were not present in the original release. You would think there would be nothing new to say about high school high-jinks, American style, but Cameron Crowe did come up with a few fresh ideas in his novel which he has now skillfully transferred to the big screen. The movie is also indebted to a very, very capable cast, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, a talented young lady who is utterly convincing in a very difficult role. True, some of the other players are equally charismatic, particularly Judge Reinhold, Phoebe Cates, Brian Becker, Robert Romanos and of course, Ray Walston as the sarcastic history teacher. Oddly, Sean Penn, who receives first billing, is not part of the main group but has a subsidiary role as a stoned surfie. All the fast-food scenes are very, very funny. I wasn't overfond of director Amy Heckerling's choice of camera angles. She seemed to be aiming for a quick sell-off to TV. True, she makes effective use of actual locations, but is inclined to use far, far too many close-ups. Oddly, the processing of the re- issue prints is far superior to the originals which were rather grainy and rough- and-ready looking.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
14,wes-connors,Getting Wasted Youth,9,19 December 2010,"At first blush, this seems like it's just your typical 1980s teen movie collection of Hollywood-situated actors acting like they're still in high school. The difference is - IT'S FUNNY! Director Amy Heckerling and writer Cameron Crowe know what's real, and how to pull out poignant, seriocomic emotions. The main storyline features budding slut Jennifer Jason Leigh (as Stacy Hamilton) getting advice from experienced sexpot Phoebe Cates (as Linda Barrett). After awkwardly losing it, she gets in trouble with smooth-talking mall rat Robert Romanus (as Mike Damone), who is advising nerdy Brian Backer (as Mark ""Rat"" Ratner)...The Go-Go's' ""We Got the Beat"" and Oingo Boingo's ""Goodbye, Goodbye"" make stupendous soundtrack bookends...Meanwhile, jerking Judge Reinhold (Brad Hamilton) can't keep his hands on a fast-food restaurant job. Throughout it all, perpetually stoned Sean Penn (as Jeff Spicoli) heads up a Greek chorus of surfer buds (avec Eric Stoltz and Anthony Edwards). The chemistry between Mr. Penn and history teacher Ray Walston (as Mr. Hand) is most amazing; pairing these two was something impossible to plan, which makes their exchanges all the more hilarious. Probably the secret to this film's success is that it takes chances. You also see this in several startling moments. But, it's balanced... ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is not bogus.********* Fast Times at Ridgemont High (8/13/82) Amy Heckerling ~ Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinhold, Robert Romanus",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
15,BandSAboutMovies,It all starts here!,8,9 April 2019,"In the interview he did with us this week, Teen Movie Hell author Mike ""McBeardo"" McPadden said that ""All previous teen comedies lead to Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and all subsequent teen comedies have proceeded forth from it.""In his 1981 book, future director Cameron Crowe went undercover at Clairemont High School in San Diego and wrote about his real-life experiences. Directed by Amy Heckerling (Clueless, the Look Who's Talking series, Johnny Dangerously and National Lampoon's European Vacation), this movie follows the book and expands on it.Interestingly enough, Mark Ratner in this film was modeled on a kid named Andy Rathbone, who claims that he actually did a lot of the Spicoli cool things too. He had become friends with Cameron and didn't realize he was being lied to and ended up pretty hurt by the experience. But don't feel too bad for him. He went on to write the For Dummies books, so he ended up doing pretty well for himself.This is a film made up of characters and the way they intersect from the end of summer, the high school year and into the next summer. That's really the story arch of the film, which allows the characters to breathe and come into their own.Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) starts the year as one of the most popular seniors at Ridgemont High School. Next year seems set: he's a multiple time employee of the month at All-American Burger, he's breaking up with his girlfriend Lisa (Amanda Wyss) so that he can be eligible all year long and his car is nearly paid off. It all falls apart: he gets fired for yelling at an abusive customer, Lisa breaks up with him before he can, he gets a job at Captain Hook Fish & Chips where he's forced to wear a humiliating outfit and worst of all, he's caught masturbating by his sister's best friend Linda (the bewitching Phoebe Cates).His sister Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) may have an even rougher year: other than her job at the Perry's Pizza (Leigh actually did work at a Perry's Pizza for a month before filming began) at the mall, her biggest job seems to be losing her virginity, which she finally does with stereo salesman Ron Johnson, who she tells that she's 19 (she's 15 and he's 26). Their baseball dugout sex is boring and she tries to find love afterward with Mark Ratner, who works at the movie theater at the mall. However, his best friend Damone the ticket scalper ends up trying to steal her away, getting her pregnant, which nice guy Mark ends up helping her take care of. Damone is a total scumbag, but it's interesting to me that Cameron put the words of his friend Glen Frey into his mouth when he discusses Stacy not seeing anything in Mark: ""If this girl can't smell your qualifications, then who needs her?""Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) is a surfer who is bold enough to order a pizza to his history class, a fact that does little to endear him to Mr. Hand (Ray Walston). He also ends up wrecking star football player Charles Jefferson's (Forest Whitaker) Camaro, but his writing racial slurs all over it and blaming the school's rival Lincoln High ends up leading Jefferson to his best game ever. On the night of prom, Mr. Hand keeps Spicoli in his room, forcing him to pay back the eight hours of class time that he wasted with a one-on-one lesson.There are tons of little cameos as we amble to the conclusion. This is one of Nicholas Cage's first films, as he's one of Spicoli's stoner buds, as are Eric Stoltz and Anthony Edwards. Pamela Springsteen - Angela Baker herself - shows up, as does Kelli Maroney (Chopping Mall, Night of the Comet), Vincent Schiavelli as teacher Mr. Vargas and Lana Clarkson (Barbarian Queen and future Phil Spector victim) as his beyond hot wife.Everything ends up pretty good for all concerned: Mark and Stacy are having a passionate love affair (but haven't gone all the way yet) while he makes up with Damone, who gets arrested for scalping. Brad gets a job at a convenience store and is promoted to manager after he and Spicoli foil a robbery. Speaking of that iconic character, he saves Brooke Shields from drowning and spends the reward getting Van Halen to play his birthday party. Linda moves in with her Abnormal Psychology professor at UC Riverside. And Mr. Hand still thinks everyone is on dope.If you were 12 in 1984, like I was, the scene where Phoebe Cates appears rising from the pool changed your life. It's the kind of cultural connection that kids today will never have. Judge Reinhold brought a large dildo to play with for this scene, which Cates didn't know about until she saw it. That's why her look of horror is so honest.The other star of this film is the Sherman Oaks Galleria, the mall that contains much of the action. This is the mall where Moon Unit Zappa would invent the term valley girl for her song with her father, which led to the movie Valley Girl, which was also filmed in this mall. Other movies that use this location include the aforementioned Chopping Mall and Night of the Comet (which means that Kelli Maroney spent plenty of time at the Galleria), as well as Commando, Back to the Future Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Phantom of the Mall: Eric's Revenge and Innerspace.If you haven't seen this movie, you really need to get off the internet and fix that. It really holds up and also rewards multiple viewings.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

18,Scarecrow-88,Fast Times at Ridgemont High,7,27 December 2009,"You always hear talk about certain movies which define a generation regarding high school life. I can't really say ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" was that way with me as it was others, but watching it again late tonight, I realize it is one for many a few years older than myself. It preceded me, as one of my film's was Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. Those were movies which I watched multiple times as a kid, then revisited them as my years in high school were coming to an end. But, to see all the names associated with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", it certainly had a groundswell of talent which would blossom in years to come. While actors with careers like Nicholas Cage, Anthony Edwards, and Eric Stoltz wouldn't exactly flourish until years afterward(..their roles are all quite small, or cameos of little significance to this film's plot), others like Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates, Judge Reinhold, Forest Whitaker, and Sean Penn has sizable roles which only opened larger doors, and we can only grin at their future success, knowing this was a place where they got their start. Like many teen movies in this decade and the previous 70's, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" had a provocative script with great emphasis on sex and drugs. It's really a scattershot series of events in the lives of teenagers during a particular school year.A fifteen year old experiments with sex(JJL), getting pregnant by a boy who only lasted a few seconds, and, without his help, had to get an abortion on her own. A theater patron(Brian Backer)carries a torch for JJL. Phoebe Cates is JJL's pal and she is always commenting on her sex life with an older ""mature"" man. Judge Reinhold's life becomes quite complicated when he loses a managerial job at a hamburger joint and his girlfriend of two years(Amanda Wyss;A Nightmare on Elm Street, Better Off Dead)calls off their relationship. Sean Penn is a pothead surfer who raises the ire of his uptight teacher Mr. Hand(Ray Walston). Forest Whitaker is a star football player who demolishes the opponent team, believing they trashed his car(..Penn and Whitaker's little brother were the actual culprits!). Robert Romanus is a ticket scalper who gets pal Backer's potential love interest pregnant. These specific characters are the main ones focused on at times during the movie.I can see why this might be offensive. JJL's awkward scenes involving sex and nudity even had me a little uneasy. How Romanus gets off with a slap on the wrist for his part in JJL's pregnancy(..although, she played a heavy part in this, one has to admit). While a popular scene forever remembered, the pizza delivery in the classroom, while funny, is highly unlikely. I wasn't as bothered by some of the sexually frank dialogue as others for I recognize that these conversations occur by both sexes(..the experiences, such as delivering oral pleasure and the complete sexual act as well)in school as teenagers ponder what ""it feels like"". While seemingly neat and tidy a resolution, I have a hard time believing JJL's Stacy would recover from that abortion so quickly and easily. As a whole, I enjoy this movie, reliving that period fondly, the cast is a delight, and the music is terrific. I can see why it's embraced still after all these years, even if I have my share of problems with the film. The scene with Cates, Reinhold's ""fantasy"" is a riot and a pleasure to behold. It was cool seeing both Backer and Romanus together again after appearing in The Burning, knowing that several familiar faces in my favorite genre, horror, pop up(..such as Pamela Springsteen as the psycho Angela in the subsequent Sleepaway Camp sequels, Kelli Maroney as, you guessed it, a cheerleader who takes her position seriously, and, as already mentioned, Wyss as Reinhold's former girlfriend who wouldn't put out for him). V Schiavelli has a memorable part as a biology teacher notorious for taking his class to a real dissection of a human corpse(..and his wife is a babe). I think the culture clash between Walston and Penn is timeless(..and I can just feel his pain as he must grade such poor work despite all his efforts to teach these kids).",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
19,preppy-3,Dated but OK,7,24 October 2001,"A look at teenage life and love (and sex) circa 1980 in California. I loved this film back when it came out. I graduated from high school in 1980, so I knew these characters and the movie treated teenagers realistically and was well-acted and funny. It was a rare Hollywood film that showed true-to-life teenagers. 20 years later I still like it's honesty but I don't find it funny anymore and it's actually kind of boring. Also the approach to sex is very naive (the pre AIDS talk is very uncomfortable to sit through). There are some sex scenes but not many. Supposedly there were a lot more shot but they were cut before the movie was released. What saves this film is the great soundtrack (starts right off with the Go-Gos ""We Got the Beat"") and some very nice, natural performances from Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates and Judge Reinhold. However, Robert Romanus (playing the school scalper) is ugly and gives out a horrible performance. The best scenes in the film belong to Sean Penn (as Jeff Spicoli, a constantly stoned teenager) and Ray Walston (as Mr. Hand a very tough teacher). Their verbal battles are hilarious and definitely worth catching.So, it's an OK film on late 70s/early 80s teen life.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
20,Bunuel1976,"FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (Amy Heckerling, 1982) **1/2",6,26 November 2008,"While not generally into teen comedies, I had decided to check the film out several years ago on Italian TV given its high rating on the Leonard Maltin guide; having attained something of a cult reputation in the interim, and not being quite sure of what I had made of it at the time, I recently rented Universal’s SE DVD.Adapted by future film-maker Cameron Crowe from his own novel (culled from a year-long research into the subject by apparently enrolling incognito into high school!), the movie also incorporates his love of rock music (as later seen in the autobiographical ALMOST FAMOUS [2000], inspired by his exploits as “Rolling Stone” magazine’s youngest contributor). He brings undeniable insight into the sex-starved lives of teenagers which, with the little it has changed in the intervening years, I guess makes the film just as relevant today as the day it came out; the problem is that the whole has little appeal outside of its intended audience (which, at 32, I can’t really relate to despite not having a family of my own)! The film is notable for its frank depiction of sexual encounters and its cast of youngsters, many of whom would soon hit the big time – Sean Penn as the constantly-doped surfer, Jennifer Jason Leigh as the virginal student, Phoebe Cates as her luscious and experienced best friend, Judge Reinhold as Leigh’s brother (who has a tough time keeping jobs at various fast-food chains), Forest Whitaker as a football star and, in bit parts, Eric Stoltz and Nicolas Cage (billed Coppola). Among the elders, the most prominent are Ray Walston as the disciplinarian (even vindictive) U.S. history teacher – who’s constantly at loggerheads with Penn – and Vincent Schiavelli as the biology professor. In the long run, however, the final verdict is that there are better movies of its ilk out there: NATIONAL LAMPOON’S ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) is more memorably irreverent and PORKY’S (1981) is bawdier and funnier.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

This alone makes the price of a ticket worthwhile.Those of us that were to old for the eighties, can see just what it was like to be a teen at that time. No plot here; just a look at teen life as they tried to get laid or get high or both.It was good to see the departed Ray Walston as Mr. Hand, or Vincent Schiavelli as Mr. Vargas.Great soundtrack made it even more fun, as did the skintastic pics of Phoebe Cates and Jennifer Jason Leigh.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Written by Cameron Crowe, who went on to direct Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky. Captures well the teenage zeitgeist. Fun, funny, with some good drama and warmth too.Excellent soundtrack, as you would expect (Crowe used to be e Rolling Stone musical reporter).The cast contains heaps of names which are well-known now, but were relatively unknown at the time: Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinhold, Forrest Whitaker, Phoebe Cates, Eric Stoltz, Nicolas Cage. An accidental all-star cast! Sean Penn is almost unrecognisable as stoner-slacker Jeff Spicoli - a far cry from the sort of roles he's famous for.

23,view_and_review,You know what high school in Hollywood is all about,6,11 September 2018,"Where I grew up in the 80's the term ""fast"" had a negative connotation. It was typically used to refer to girls (I know double standard) who were flirty or promiscuous. It was always reserved for young girls because the indication was that she was growing up too fast. So adults would say, ""she's fast"" as an insult.""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" fell perfectly into that description. A quasi-comedy about teenagers getting involved in sex, drugs, sex, partying, and more sex. This was high school life--for those at Ridgemont High anyway. There was comedy and even a serious tone--although the serious situations even had a light air to them. The funny scenes mostly contained Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn)--but for me it was a teen movie. Not ""Another Teen Movie"" but a teen movie nonetheless and I find it hard to really like them. So, for a teen movie, this one was alright.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
24,neil-476,A Petrie Dish of a film,8,18 March 2011,"Fast Times, taken on its own merits is enjoyable enough but, perhaps, nothing particularly special. Yet, look at it again from the side: 1. It more or less single-handedly created the format for raunchy US high school coming-of-age movies: 2. It was a first outing for the not inconsiderable autobiographical talents of Cameron Crowe; 3. It contained THAT moment. You know, the seminal red bikini slo-mo moment. You knew what I was talking about, didn't you? 4. Most importantly, it was a breeding ground - a Petrie dish, if you will - for a generation of the USA's young actors. The list bears repeating: Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates (if only she hadn't retired so young!), Judge Reinhold (never off the screen for a while), Forest Whitaker, Eric Stoltz, Nicolas Cage, Antony Edwards...Watch and marvel!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
25,AlsExGal,A great time capsule of high school days 35 years ago...,8,11 December 2016,"... before zero tolerance and before hand held computers. It is a year in the life of a bunch of high schoolers, accent on Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh), 15 years old. The first thing you notice in the first shot of the film is the traditional mall - people used to have to go OUT to shop, or meet other people or do anything else. The internet is 15 years in the future. Furthermore, teenagers used to work at minimum wage jobs in the mall for spending money. At some point in the past 35 years this got to be beneath them.Stacy works at a pizzeria with her friend Linda (Phoebe Cates). The mild mannered and rather non-descript looking Mark Ratner who works at the movie theater has a crush on Stacy. Both Mark and Stacy get very bad advice from their friends Mike Damone and Linda, respectively. Judge Reinhold plays Stacy's older brother, a senior in high school. He takes life just a little too seriously and thinks he has life by the reins. Life is about to teach him differently.Meanwhile the inexperienced Stacy is actually believing the advice Linda is giving her, who says she is in a long distance relationship with a much older boy. The adults in the audience can tell that Linda is obviously lying about her experience and is clueless about the value of the advice she is giving out and even how this so-called boyfriend of hers sees their relationship. Linda doesn't know the difference between sex and love because sex is still a thing of wonder to her, and she is leading Stacy down the same road to - if not ruin, heartbreak - that she is on.Now I'm making this sound like some kind of tragedy, but it is also extremely funny. This is almost like Charlie Brown because although you hear about the adults, they are seldom seen except for the no-nonsense history teacher Mr. Hand played brilliantly by Ray Walston. Then there is Mr. Hand's nemesis Jeff Spicoli also played brilliantly and just a little too genuinely by Sean Penn. Spicoli is a stoned out guy who fancies himself a future surfing champ and really has no place in his life for rules and schedules, the stuff Mr. Hand lives and dies by. Don't worry, Mr. Hand gets his revenge in the end, and not by failing Spicoli either. Mr. Hand is smart enough to know that would only hurt Mr. Hand. When I say Penn plays Spicoli just a little too genuinely, Penn said in an interview one time that playing Spicoli was easy for him because all he had to do was channel his teen aged self.Highly recommended as a bit of a cross between Clueless and ""The Last Days of Disco"" as far as relationships and the sexual revolution go. It's a look at teen aged life when we didn't take ourselves quite so seriously.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
26,Uriah43,"One of the Better ""High School Comedies"" of the 80's",7,10 February 2017,"This movie revolves around several students at Ridgemont High School who all have their own individual issues they have to work out along the way. For example, ""Brad Hamilton"" (Judge Reinhold) works at All-American Burger and everybody considers him as a success--until her gets fired. ""Mark 'Rat' Ratner"" (Brian Backer) works at the theater in the mall and has a crush on a girl in his biology class named ""Stacy Hamilton"" (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unfortunately, being shy and inexperienced, Rat turns to his best friend ""Mike Damone"" (Robert Romanus) who generously advises him but then proceeds to have sex with Stacy--and comes to regret it immediately afterwards. Also featured is a pothead named ""Jeff Spicoli"" (Sean Penn) who has a problem with his history teacher by the name of ""Mr. Hand"" (Ray Walston) Or to be more accurate, perhaps it's better to say that Mr. Hand has a problem with Jeff Spicoli. In any case, this was one of better ""high school comedies"" produced during the 80's and typifies this particular era in film quite well. Above average.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

28,Aaron1375,Comedy about life at Ridgemont High. Times are certainly fast.,7,14 April 2011,"This comedy is rather funny, it is one of those pieces that focuses on multiple stories and subplots. You have your loser that annoys one of the teachers, you have your loser who wants to date a hot girl and you have your guy that seems stable, but ends up losing his job. The movie also has a subplot I do not really care for and sure it is relevant to high school and such, I just do not think a pregnancy and abortion were the best subplot to throw into what was mainly a comedy with very little sentimental attitude. I also am not totally opposed to abortion, but I do not care for a girl getting one after doing absolutely nothing to protect herself. It is one thing to get one if you're protecting yourself and do everything preventative in your power, it is another to do it after letting a jerk have sex with you while you are acting like you are dating an oblivious dolt. Enough of my sermon, the rest of the movie is funny, the cast is good for the most part and aside from the one poorly chosen subplot most of the comedy bits work. Sean Penn, an actor I have probably never seen in anything else is rather funny as Jeff Spicoli. Judge Reinhold is also good and I totally feel for him as he got fired from that one job. I have been set up like that in my job, but I usually just say 'I will call for a manager' as soon as I can tell the person is going to be difficult. So for the most part funny, not the funniest comedy from this era, but it certainly has one of the best pool scenes ever.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
29,Wuchakk,"""You'll laugh, you'll cry""",9,23 July 2011,"In my humble opinion, 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and 1994's ""Dazed and Confused"" are the best high school comedy-dramas.I had a taped-from-TV VHS version of ""Fast Times"" and watched it a few times over the years; I thought the film was decent, but nothing exceptional, that is, until I recently bought the DVD and saw the film the only way it was meant to be viewed -- in its original, uncut form. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that ""Fast Times"" is indeed great and I had been seriously ripped-off in my past viewings. In fact, it seemed like I was seeing the film for the first time! The story is set in a California high school in 1982. What makes ""Fast Times"" work so well is, despite the goofy Spicoli antics, it honestly attempts to depict the high school/teenage experience in all it's glory & shame, good times & bad. Too many films of this ilk focus on raunchy shenanigans and go no deeper. ""Fast Times"" doesn't make this mistake. The film features quality characters with great depth and the viewer experiences (or re-experiences) the fun/painful high school years through them. Although there's a little nudity and sexual explicitness it's not overkill and, besides, it belongs in a film that endeavors to honestly depict the high school experience, otherwise it wouldn't be true-to-life; in other words, it'd be a lie.Damone is a great character with his smooth-talking mesmerism. He strongly believes in putting on airs to succeed and conceals any weakness. If he falls flat, so to speak, he immediately covers-up and acts like nothing happened. Never advertise your failings or the savage wolves will tear you to pieces, he seems to think. Many of his pithy sayings & beliefs are absolutely true, e.g. ""Wherever you're at, that's the place to be."" In other words, ""Live in the moment."" Although he uses a girl as a sex object and swiftly loses a good friend & follower as a result, I found it interesting that he later genuinely apologizes, which shows humility and character. The friend then sees the humanity behind Damone's smooth-talk and properly opts to forgive & forget. This is great stuff.Another quality character is Stacy Hamilton, played excellently by Jennifer Jason Leigh. She's petite, cute and can cop an alluring expression for the object of her desire, which totals three in the story.The other characters are strong as well -- Stacey's likable older brother, Brad; the ""surfer dude"" Spicoli; the awkward-but-trying-hard Mark ""Rat"" Ratner; Stacey's sexy best friend, Linda (Phoebe Cates); etc.Late in the film we observe Stacey make a huge mistake and suffer the consequences. It's to the movie's merit that this episode is genuinely heart-wrenching, especially considering that the film's largely a comedy. Then her brother unexpectedly shows up, faithful and dependable; he doesn't say much but it's clear he loves his sister dearly. It's scenes like this that propel ""Fast Times"" head & shoulders above the competition.Another sequence that hits home is when a certain character humorously fantasizes about his dream girl, but it goes too far and... (I can't give it away, but it's totally hilarious and true-to-life).Then there's Spicoli's relationship with Mr. Hand. On the surface these two are nemeses, but we observe a different dimension to their relationship near the end when Mr. Hand has a tutoring session with Spicoli in his bedroom. The teacher is almost enlightened when he discovers that Spicoli actually understands the principles of history, it's just that he phrases the data according to his sub-cultural lexicon. Also, as unlikely as the tutoring session in Spicoli's bedroom seems, I had to do this when I was in high school due to a broken leg and literal body cast. An older gentleman would sit by my bed and tutor me a few times a week for a few months.Of course, the soundtrack is a highlight as well. Go to IMDb's ""soundtrack listing"" for all the songs, like ""We Got the Beat,"" ""Kashmir"" and ""Somebody's Baby."" CONCLUSION: Like I said, ""Fast Times"" is one of the best high school comedy-dramas out there, along with ""Dazed and Confused."" It eschews one-dimensional and juvenile raunch for something deeper, more balanced, true-to-life and even moving. Simply put, ""Fast Times"" is a must own.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
30,Mr-Fusion,Deeper than I was led to believe,7,16 August 2012,"""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is one of those movies you have to revisit every few years. And part of what makes this a treat it that it's a time capsule of the early '80s. Everything from the fashions to Pac Man and the Mall scene, right down to (and especially) the soundtrack. I don't think the filmmakers meant for the movie to live on in this particular way, but that's how things shook out. It also plays as a who's who of future movie stars. The entire cast is littered with familiar faces and they always seem to come out of nowhere.But underneath the fame of Jeff Spicoli and a terrific Phoebe Cates swimsuit fantasy is a story of surprising sensitivity; one that deals with real issues and puts a philosophical spin on the first sexual encounter. It's awkward and unsatisfying, but you've done it and cane move on with your adult life. Don't get me wrong, this movie's funny in its own right, but it sure takes the wackiness out of the teen sex comedy.In the best way possible.7/10",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

32,StevePulaski,All I need is efficient characters and a focus and I'm all good,8,13 June 2012,"It's common knowledge to note that every decade has their own ""defining"" film for the teenage youth. The seventies had American Graffiti, the eighties had this and Porky's, and the nineties had American Pie. The big question is; what makes them so loved and cherished, even to this day? I think it's the relatable qualities, the close to home nature, and the sentimentality of the picture as a whole.The dedication to make this film work is nothing shy of admirable; screenwriter Cameron Crowe went undercover at Clairemont High School in California for a year as a student to get an inside look at the teenage life. He was planning to pen his book Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A True Story. He then had the idea to make it into a film, and rounded up director Amy Heckerling and so a film was born.Much like Porky's, a film I reviewed last summer which has gone on to recently be my most viewed review, somehow, someway, the film follows a generic and straight-forward plot line, where it eventually picks and chooses which characters it will like to follow. We have Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold), the obligatorily obnoxious upperclassman, his younger sister, Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a fifteen year old Freshman who is a lot more interested and curious about older guys and sex than they are about her, her current love interest, Mark ""Rat"" Ratner (Brian Backer), Ridgemont's star football player, Charles Jefferson (Forrest Whitaker in one of his earliest roles), and the iconic Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn), a rather typical, ""totally rad"" stoner who is constantly the target for ridicule by his teacher, Mr. Hand (Ray Walston).Yes, they are all caricatures, but the film persistently tries to feed life into them, making them fly past their cookie-cutter appearances. There's definite determination here and, surprisingly, despite being a tad too heavily erected on conventions (sort of the last thing I'd expect after the writer himself went undercover in a high school) it's a well done film. It packs a certain care and understanding for the teenage life, where everything begins to change. Driving becomes doable, maturity elbows its way in, and sex becomes a rather recurring topic. Fast Times at Ridgemont High may not be the ideal comedy for the subject, but it addresses it in a kinder manner than many give it credit for it. It's blunt, but it has a solid point.Starring: Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinhold, Phoebe Cates, Brian Backer, Robert Romanus, Ray Walston, Forest Whitaker, Nicolas Cage (Coppola), and Anthony Edwards.

It is so referenced to society and some of it's scenes are legendary. I was watching I love the 80's and they showed some pretty funny clips, so it was always on my mind to give this movie a look. I finally remembered to rent it at Hollywood Video and watched it last night. Although I'm not sure I laughed as much as others would have, I still liked this film for some reason. Just because I think in one way or another you could relate to it and remember how hard it was being a teenager.We have Stacey and Linda, two hot young high school students who are very sex deprived and look to make this year their best ever. Mike who is chasing after Stacy and looking to have a meaningful relationship with her. Brad, a senior who is looking to make his last year the best but plans turn out to be different when everything turns on him. Then of course we have Jeff Spacolli, the stoner surfer dude who manages to finally let a teacher, Mr. Hand, have his own.Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a classic teen comedy that I would highly recommend. It is all in good fun and was just so much fun to watch. The cast looked like they had so much fun and the movie just looked like a blast to make. It's understandable on why this film's legacy lives on, this was the movie to watch before American Pie and it's always a joy to stick to the original, trust me.

34,KineticSeoul,Didn't grow up in the 80's but still engaging,6,10 August 2012,"This basically like watching high school life during the early 80's although I didn't attend high school in the 80's. It's with teens dealing with emotional problems and feelings and being open about it through conversations with friends. And the conversations in this movie is actually funny although you heard, hear or will hear similar stuff in high school. But most of the conversations is about the opposite sex and how to handle certain situations when it comes to the opposite sex. I will say the conversations isn't something positive or good. Like everyone else is doing it so we need to do it to fit in kinda stuff. ""One of the greatest challenge in life is being yourself in a world that is trying to make you like everyone else"" which is indeed a difficult challenge for some students. Despite the message not being good it's still entertaining to watch. But yeah all the way to high school year when it comes to the students it's all about popularity, fitting in and doing what everyone else does or what the media say is cool. But the portrayal of the setting and the characters is realistic, especially with the dialogue to the point it's intriguing. Although it can be similar conversations you heard before in real life. Now this movie doesn't have a core story but shows how multiple different teens deal with worries and what is on their mind while attending and not attending high school. Overall despite the constant shallow messages and it being politically incorrect. It was engaging to see how some teens really act in the early 80's. Now I never seen ""American Graffiti"" but after watching this movie I sort of want to see it now. It's kinda strange to see popular celebs now a days so young in this movie.6.9/10",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I simply waited too long.Fast Times at Ridgemont High is as dated as they come, yet all the males (mostly, if not exclusively straight) remember this movie fondly. Heck, it was featured just recently in the most current American Dad episode. (Side Note: thankfully, I just now saw this, so I knew who Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) was and could catch the reference.) So, it's an enormously influential part of the everyday heterosexual male's life.Is it because of the extensive female nudity? The surfer-dude anarchy/teachers N school sucks! attitude? How about the whole package: show a movie that should contain male nudity, such as the boy's locker room or a guy masturbating, but don't because guys don't want to see that?Pause. Yep, that's what guys wanted to see. No sausages, only breasts. Well. You'll get that, plus so little more!Such as NO PLOT. Guys fooling around. A school year that passes before your eyes. Teachers that are a blind as politicians to the American voter's needs.What more do you want?Well, I want more. But, even being late to seeing this movie, roughly thirty years – argh, I need some resemblance of a plot line. Halfway through this movie I was trying to figure out what it was all about.

It had a great soundtrack.Is it a movie I want to see again? NO. Is it because I'm not heterosexual? NO. Is it because I saw it 30 some odd years too late? NO. It's because I enjoy my movies with substance.That doesn't make this a terrible movie as it was a fun viewing. But it does make it a one-time, event film that would've been great for horny boys in the early 80s. Step into (EVEN) 1983 and we've already outdated ourselves. Haven't we? Whoa!

36,ThomasDrufke,Let's Party,7,16 July 2018,"The classic case of a film that is very much of its time but yet can still have an impact on generations to come. I've been recommended this film by so many people from the age of early 30's to early 50's. Just like The Graduate in the generation before it and for my generation Superbad, Fast Times doesn't have a deep plot or huge character development, but it showcases a moment in time for a group of high schoolers who are into sex, drugs, and rock n roll. I can't say I felt a great connection to any one particular character but the iconic scenes and quotes are undeniable, Sean Penn is electric, Ray Walston plays a perfect jerk teacher, and Phoebe Cates is memorable (to say the least). This film only displays slices of high school life, but Cameron Crowe's script feels far more real than something that may come out in 2018. The genuine production is something to strive for.7.6/10",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
37,g-bodyl,Holds Up Very Well!,9,4 December 2014,"I am a sucker for 80's teen films, especially from the likes of John Hughes and Howard Deutch. But the one film that started this craze was the excellent Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The film receives lessons in vulgarity from 1978's Animal House, but it doesn't lose any of it's sweetness. I'm surprised how well the film holds up because many of the events in the film may as well happened during my high school years. It's all about drugs, sex, and rock'n'roll(at least it was back in the 80's....). The film takes social issues teens constantly deal with and turns these issues into characters that everyone can relate with.Amy Heckerling's film tells a story that focuses on a select group of characters. There is Jeff Spicoli who is a laid-back stoner and has a thing for surfing. Stacy who is a young girl in need of sex and her older brother Brad, who is a senior bouncing from place-to-place job-wise. There is Linda who is a gorgeous, smart girl and Mike who is a ticket scalper. There is also Mr. Hand, the world's most uptight history teacher.The acting is really good here. The film features performances from future Oscar-winners like Sean Penn, Forest Whittaker, and even Nic Cage. Penn's performance is the standout as everyone's favorite stoner. The film also has a good group of 80's favorites such as Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates, and Judge Reinhold. Finally, Ray Walston delivers an excellent performance as Mr. Hand.Overall, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a fantastic comedy and is the advent of all the excellent teen films from the 80's and 90's. I'm surprised how well the film holds up. It also features a killer soundtrack from my favorite artists such as Tom Petty and the Cars. The film is not only raucously funny, it has a very sweet core. We come to care about the characters, and that is always a plus in a film featuring mostly teens. This is what someone would call an 80's classic. I rate this film 9/10.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I'm actually surprised he didn't win any award for his character, he was spot on! He is like, the only one I knew outta all the actors on this!It was kinda stupid in having a teenage pregnancy on this, it would've been better off if the scene when Stacy and Mike Damone were having sex, it honestly needed to be cut off. It was even pointless as well, it wouldn't have wasted the movies time!I seriously loved Ray Walston as Mr Hand, I never even heard of the man before and I think he is such a great actor. I would be wondering if he actually was a teacher in real life, he plays one so well.Even though I found the movie enjoyable and funny, I think they should've done the ending right!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
40,inkblot11,"NOT a perpetual yukfest, although there are funny parts; others are quite serious",8,19 May 2017,"Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has a typical teen life in California. At fifteen, she works in a pizza parlor after school and longs to have her first true romantic encounter. That's right, she's never gone ""all the way"". Her older brother Brad (Judge Reinhold) also works hard at his job at Burger World and has been dating a fellow student for two years. Meanwhile, surfer-student Jeff Spicolli (Sean Penn) would far rather be smoking weed or riding the waves but his parents say he must attend school his senior year. What a shock when he gets put in a history class run by the no-nonsense Mr. Hand (Ray Walston). From his first late arrival, Spicolli rubs Mr. Hand the wrong way. A year long battle ensues. Unhappily, Stacy DOES become sexually active with the wrong guys. The first, a twenty-something, doesn't have any guilt about being with a gal so young and the second partner is also an out-for- himself dirtbag. Will she ever find someone who loves her? This classic coming of age film has its funny moments. Penn is a total laugh generator and many of the teens have such awkward moments they are comedic. Forest Whitaker likewise delivers many smiles for his annihilation of the opposing football team after his car is wrecked by others. But, there are also many serious scenes and situations which make the movie a good bet for teens who need reassurance that they are not alone with problems. Leigh is terrific and all of the other young actors are, too. The sets, costumes, script, and lively direction enhance the flick as does the wonderful soundtrack.

41,atlasmb,Exploring the Teenage Experience,8,24 December 2015,"Three seminal films of the seventies and eighties explored the high school experience: ""Grease (1978), ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985), and this film--""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982).Each of these films dealt with the common themes of the high school experience and the issues that confront all teens. Such films are, of course, coming of age stories, with teens discovering where they fit in socially. And learning about sexuality and the awkwardness of first experiences.""Fast Times"" is packed with wonderful performances, but the central characters are a brother and sister--Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) and Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Both hold part-time jobs and are learning valuable lessons about the benefits and vagaries of employment. Brad has a regular girlfriend, but is beginning to feel he is too young to commit exclusively. Stacy feels she lacks the sexual experience of her peers, so she considers forcing the issue.""Fast Times"" defines the school cliques of its time, just like the other two films. Teens want to belong, to find acceptance, and director Amy Heckerling does a good job of exposing the vulnerability that results from their longing.The film is also a comedy. Some of the funniest scenes revolve around Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn), whose portrayal of the wasted surfer dude is pure genius. His foil is Mr. Hand (Ray Walston), the opinionated and strict American History teacher who makes it his job to stand up to the Spicoli's. He is to Spicoli what Mr. Rooney is to Ferris Bueller, but with more caring. He is not trying to force his students to follow the rules because he seeks power; he is hoping to teach them some things about life and responsibility.Ms. Heckerling's vision for the film was unflinching, including some ""graphic"" scenes that were cut to avoid an ""X"" rating. But the expurgated version still addresses tough teen issues head on. Older viewers will recognize the situations and identify with the characters' feelings.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
42,The-Sarkologist,Sean Penn simply Shines as Jeff Spicoli,8,30 January 2012,"Well, Martin Ebert hated this movie but for some reason I think that he has missed the entire point. Fast Times at Ridgemont High is pretty much a T&A movie, but it takes a different angle to that of Animal House. I tend not to like T&A movies, and I have seen quite a few of them; films such as Revenge of the Nerds, Porky's, Animal House, just to name the more famous ones. Fast Times does fall into this category but I think that there is more behind the themes in this movie, and if you come to this movie simply expect the typical Americanisms then you will be sourly disappointed.Fast Times at Ridgemont High is based around a girl, Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who really wants to know about sex. What makes this movie different is that Stacy changes through the movie as she goes through numerous experiences. She begins as a nymphomaniac, wanting to bed anybody she can get, and in the end settles for a non-sexual relationship. Stacy comes to realise at the end of the movie that boyfriends are not about sex but about relationships, and it is with this realisation that this movie draws to a close. Most comedies of this genre have the nerd, who in this movie is Mike Damone (Robert Romanus), chasing after the pretty girl all through the movie only to finally get her at the end. Damone and Stacy get together halfway through the movie, but it is Stacy's confusion about the nature of the boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, that doesn't have it fulfilled until the end.The other characters in the movie also raise it above the simple vulgarity of the typical T&A movie (but it is still classified as soft porn, particularly some scenes play out like a porno). Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) is one example. He begins the movie with everything going for him, and as such he is an incredibly arrogant boy. As the movie progresses his life begins to collapse around him. He looses his job after insulting a customer, and his girlfriend dumps him for the reason that he wanted to dump her. He then gets a job in a seafood restaurant where he has to wear a really stupid uniform. A typical T&A Movie would have everything turn out right for him, but Fast Times doesn't. He finishes the movie without a girlfriend, and the women that he does want, he never gets.Jeff Spicolli (Sean Penn) is the one character that adds so much life to this movie. It is his antics that make this movie funny. I don't find such movies funny anymore (and never really did) but it is Jeff Spicolli's rebellion that makes this movie a gem. Spicolli is the unusual character in this movie, the only other place I have seen anybody remotely similar is in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Those guys are actually duplicates of Jeff Spicolli. Their mannerisms and quotes were almost identical. The classic scene here, which was tried and failed in Hong Kong cinema, is the scene where the pizza guy delivers a pizza to Jeff in the middle of class.If you want fantasy, this is not the movie for you. Watch Revenge of the Nerds. What we have here is a movie about life. It is a movie based on a semi-real book and the characters in this movie seem to have a life about them. This isn't a movie about pretty girls getting everything that want, but more about a woman who discovers that the thrill of sex is not really all that thrilling when there is nothing behind it. The look on her face when she first does it in a football field shows how it isn't that great. A romantic time isn't experienced in a dirty shelter with graffiti all over it. The scene where she lies naked on the couch in her change rooms, while the guy she likes emotionlessly dresses and walks out also protrays a woman who's fantasies about sex been shattered. Ebert doesn't like this but I think his mind has been twisted by the fantasy elements of other T&A movies. If I want fantasy, I watch Willow, but what we have here is much closer to reality.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
43,sol-,My brief review of the film,10,27 March 2006,"Although on the surface this film might look like just another high school comedy, it is actually a very frank study of mixed emotions and the importance of sexuality to teenagers. Nothing to do with sex is glamorised in the film, and stereotypical sexual qualities based on appearances are turned around in the film. The teenage characters are defined by how they feel towards sex and love, with the exception of a junkie who is looked down upon by others, but who might actually have the best philosophy of what the days of one's youth are meant to be about. The film consists of events all threaded together without much of a solid storyline or any atmosphere, yet this works perfectly in showing the rush of the high school experience, full of many different things that are hard to pull apart. For the same reason, there is also a very limited sense of time. The film does go fast. It is very well photographed, with the camera not only following the characters around, but changing style for different characters too, and there many interesting shots that can be compared and contrasted to show the difference between lust, love, and other things. The film does not however work all the time, particularly when it handles comedy. Some subplots are inserted for laughs only, as are some characters that are drawn as stereotypes. The problem seems to be that the film wants to make us laugh as well as think, but it may have been better to just leave it dramatic and thought-provoking as some of the humour is just plain forced. The silly ""where are they now?"" credits also prevent the film from ending on a powerful note. Even so, there is a lot to think about after the film has ended. It is a time capsule of youth during the 1980s and the social pressures that teenagers faced, but even today many ideas of the film still have relevance.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that the interpretations of Sean Penn who played as Jeff Spicoli, Jennifer Jason Leigh who played as Stacy Hamilton, Judge Reinhold who played as Brad Hamilton, Forest Whitaker who played as Charles Jefferson and Robert Romanus who played as Mike Damone were all simply amazing and there were plenty of funny moments during the whole movie. Lastly, I believe that ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is an amazing movie and made me feel how it was to be a teenager back in the 80's.

Yes, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH captures that selfsame NOSTALGIA. Interestingly, it's a period piece done DURING the period it captures. There are too many memorable performances to cite here, but three need mention: Judge Reinhold as the guy who wants something MORE out of life after school; Phoebe Cates, who no doubt starred in many a wet dream; and Sean Penn as the spaced-out Spicoli.

46,eddie_baggins,An honest and memorable teen dramedy,7,29 July 2020,"Becoming an instant teen/high school classic upon release and standing the test of time regarding a steady flow of fans thanks to its ageless narrative devices and collection of colorful characters, Amy Heckerling and Cameron Crowe's lewd, crude and rude (yet somehow heartfelt) examination of the teenage landscape remains one of the most enjoyable cinematic exercises of its kind.As is to be expected from anything with Crowe attached, Fast Times at Ridgemont High takes a scatter-gun approach to its subject matter as music, over the top situations and some extremely funny/awkward moments play out before our eyes, all concerning a bunch of horny and self-discovering teenagers that are trying to find their way in this big scary world we call home.Gathering together an extremely talented cast of mainly young performers, which includes career making turns from Sean Penn as all-time classic cinematic stoner Jeff Spicoli and Jennifer Jason Leigh as the kind-hearted Stacey Hamilton, as well as some awesome cameos from the likes of Forest Whitaker and Nic Cage (Coppola at the time), Crowe and Heckerling struck gold with their casting, in what acts as one of the 80's most enjoyable ensemble pieces.Unafraid to tackle some fairly taboo subject matters and deliver lines of dialogue that would make even the most wild of teenagers at the time blush, Times isn't all fun and games as it looks to explore a range of up and down emotions and situations that litter the lives of its participants, meaning this isn't a straight up raunchy comedy that many of its 80 counterparts and imitators have since developed into.It's many of these more serious minded moments that Times has lost some of its verve and power over the years since its release, with today's climate and expectations of how media deals with such tricky moments not as refined as you'd expect from a product nearing 40 years of age, with Crowe and Heckerling not always able to balance out the moments of extreme silliness with more intense moments such as teenage pregnancy and romantic ups and downs.At its core however, Times is a film with a strong sense of heart and openness to portray its subject matters as flawed and relatable human beings, with Crowe's ability to create characters we can all trace back to our own lives a huge reason why the rag-tag groups of miscreants and trouble-makers we find here have been able to endear themselves into many viewers hearts and mind and remain a staple of pop culture all these years on.Final Say -Sometimes messy and unfocused and not always dedicating itself fully to examining the more serious minded aspects of its bare bones plot, Fast Times at Ridgemont High remains a solidified teen classic that all of us could relate to in some way, shape or form.3 1/2 pizza deliveries out of 5",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Frankly, compared to my french experience, those high scholars had everything to be happy, enjoy every moment of this time and maybe later feel deeply nostalgic about it Maybe the movie is not accurate for every one, but i see that those teens had their personal room in family houses > in France, we lived all together in old, decaying buildings! Their study seems light (MCQ) > in France, we are in high school for 40 hours by week, almost like a job, with a lot of studies, papers, exercises to learn after the bell! Students come to schools in car, even if they are wreck > In France, we take fully loaded public transports! So at the end, in America, people have space and intimacy while in France it's hard to have such control In addition, the movies happens in the 80s so that means that there were exciting music (ever heard about melodies?), cool clothes (there is something else than G-string for girls and sportswear for boys) Finally, the cast is awesome because it's a class of future Hollywood big names and with what they do here, you can understand: Jenny is particularly moving in her discovery path, Penn is unrecognizable in the dunce, the Rat embodies that at the end good heart wins over good look, etc So instead of being the usual crazy comedy involving teens, this one is really focused about realistic slices of life and that's why it's so interesting and gripping.

There's is no real plot line, just a series of scenes that follow characters Brad, Stacy, Mike, Mark, and surfer bum Spicoli (Sean Penn). Its charm is not its humor, but its relatable parallels to high school life. It's a film about high school kids trying to get laid and dealing with jobs and parents and hard-nosed teachers in the process. It's the first thing I would give an alien studying high schools in the 1980s.The film marks the debut of writer Cameron Crowe, who essentially went undercover to deliver the accuracy of high school life and in the process sparked what would become the stereotypes that countless high school movies and TV shows would depend on for decades after. His genius is that you get all these characters. They're naive and well-intentioned, but they just screw up. That's who everyone is in high school. They're also horny, but that's another matter.""Fast Times"" is not without its memorable scenes, even if the humor won't put you in fits. The scene where Brad (Judge Reinhold) pleases himself to the image of his sister's best friend in her bright red swimsuit has inspired countless spoofs and similar re-imaginings (like 1989's ""Christmas Vacation."" Even though Spicoli feels entirely irrelevant to the plot, his scenes dealing with the infamous Mr. Hand are impeccable examples of character acting and that's why his image is synonymous with the film.So its lack of plot might be boring and it might not be the bucket of laughs you'd expect, but ""Fast Times"" is representative of a type of film-making that for is iconic and memorable because of its honesty.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
53,Anonymous_Maxine,"While Fast Times At Ridgemont High is not the side-splittingly hilarious classic comedy that it has come to be known as, it very accurately captures a picture of the eighties, and it is still quality enterta",7,22 November 2000,"Fast Times At Ridgemont High has dated pretty badly, but it still has it great moments. Sean Penn stole the show without question, and it is a shame that he did not have a larger part than he did. However, I think that this was intentional, because Amy Heckerling seems to make a conscious effort to ensure that no clearly identifiable star emerges from the film. Her main goal was to present a film that detailed high school life in the eighties as accurately as possible, without distracting the audience from that with a Hollywood star or a detailed plot. Nevertheless, it is clearly Sean Penn who is the most remembered from this film, and not just because he later enjoyed the most successful career out of all of the other actors in the film. I think that Penn's notability in Fast Times At Ridgemont High stems simply from the fact that he was by far the funniest character in the movie. He delivers a nearly flawless portrayal of the stereotypical surfer guy, with the Hawaiian t-shirt, the hot-boxed Volkswagen bus, the long hair, and the dumbed down manner of speech.
Despite all of the hilarious elements of this movie, I think that it was almost too emotional at times for the type of film that it is. We're seeing guys get fired from their jobs, girls getting their hearts broken by idiot guys, and geeks who chicken out just before they are about to get together with beautiful women (again, breaking our hearts). On the other hand, this is what life is like, and that's one thing that I really liked about this movie  it didn't sugar coat the material, but instead presented it in a more realistic way. However, I still think that there should have been more stuff with Sean Penn, and just more comedy overall. I wish most of if not all of the film had been more like the scene in the beginning where Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) and a couple of his buddies walked into the diner and took their shirts off, THAT was funny.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Every time someone opens their mouth their either talking about wanting to get laid, talking about practicing blow-jobs, and pregnancies and abortions, and then has very unsubtle references to pot. But then again, I don't think they were trying to be subtle.This movie takes place in Ridgemont, focusing on teenagers from Ridgemont High. It spans about a year throughout the movie, so Fast Times is right. We meet a group of teenagers, some guys, some girls. Some dorks, some average nice guys, and one really douchey pervert of a guy. We also have Spicoli, my personal favorite character. He's always stoned, but he's very friendly and very nice.

Pat Benatar was big, the look topped Fawcett's look big time. What rocked this movie the most is the cast. The stars were well chosen, and the plot was very obvious. However, there were some changes like in ""Porky's"" where this young girl named Stacy(Jennifer Jason Leigh) gets advice from her friend Linda(Phoebe Cates) that are anything but straight-forward. Her brother Brad(Judge Reinhold) is a big man on campus who is determined to make it big. In his case, the restaurant business is like a bad light bulb. The burger joint is sizzling away, and the seafood place was man overboard in his eyes. The memorable scenes is the pool with Phoebe Cates coming out and open her bikini top out to him in the dream, and the self-love scene is funny. Oh Boy! Then the other pool scene when Stacy have sex with Ratner's(Brian Backer) friend. And Forrest Whittaker had the cool 70's Camaro, which gets wrecked by Spicolli(Sean Penn), the surfer bum. That fueled him up to kick Lincoln High's butt in the football game. I would be mad myself if my car was vandalized and wrecked. Ray Walston did his fine work at playing History teacher Mr. Hand.

It was a new kind of a movie then. Its list of stars looks like who's who of the teenage movie stars of that period. The movie blazed the trail for many more movies of the kind that was made until well into the '90s.So I love this movie. It's one of those movies that you can't forget about, and I think it will remain that way for a long time.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

62,smatysia,Dude!,8,19 February 2001,"This film really takes me back. A lot of it rang so true, even to my high school in Texas in the mid '70's. The basis seems to be that these children are facing too many adult pressures, trying to grow up too fast. I was that way, too. Although I didn't realize it at the time, it was a wonderful time to grow up. The war was over, as was the draft. It was a great time for sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. It was before the twin scourges of AIDS and crack that turned society away from the personal freedoms (more or less) that were won earlier. The film is quite comedic, but also dips into rather edgy territory. It was great seeing all these talented and (now) famous actors at the dawn of their careers. Enough has been said about Penn. There was Anthony Edwards with hair! Could be Judge Reinhold's best work. Ray Walston was perfect as Mr. Hand, very poignant in light of his recent death. Best of all, though, were the girls. Jennifer Jason Leigh was awesome. Her sweet, young, innocent look was perfect for Stacy. (She looked great naked, too!) And Pheobe Cates. She was, and actually still is, so beautiful. And her red bikini scene in Brad's fantasy will live forever. She has more than just beauty, though, tons of sweetness and charm. I'm sure most everyone has seen this film. It is the quintessential high school film of the time.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
63,davispittman,Mostly entertaining,7,13 April 2017,"Fast times at Ridgemont High (1982) is considered by many to be an 80s classic. Is it worth such a prestigious title? In some ways yes I can see why it's loved by many, but I do have some objections to the film. First of all, I don't care for the use of the derogatory term f*g, which is used by Sean Penn's character Spicoli. Maybe that was consisted alright back then but it's not okay with me. And I could've done without the photos of naked girls EVERYWHERE in Spicoli's bedroom lol. The casting is good for the most part. I really loved Jennifer Jason Leigh in this movie, she was my favorite part actually. She goes through a growing up phase and a learning experience if you will. She has to learn throughout time in the movie that men should look for more in her than simply the potential to have sex. Not that that's wrong or that you shouldn't have some fun with it when you're young, but she has a couple of pretty bad flings and one ends up causing her some pretty bad pain. And that pain is only made worse when the guy she screwed with did something even worse to her, for which he's never really held accountable, would've liked more resolution there. Sean Penn plays a surfer dude who is literally high all the time and his vocabulary is limited to dude and man, didn't really think his character was funny or amusing, a little annoying actually. The rest of the cast does an alright job. The comedy is kind of sketchy, I didn't really laugh much. The thing I liked was Leigh's journey in the movie and seeing her storyline unfold. In my opinion there are much better 80s movies to be seen other than this one. 6/10.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
64,RavenGlamDVDCollector,how to fill a red bikini,7,9 April 2017,"This is the movie made famous by the bikini sequence carried out so talentfully by Phoebe Cates, shortly after she starred in the controversial nudity-filled movie PARADISE. It also features some intimate scenes with a very young Jennifer Jason Leigh at the beginning of her career. On the extras of the DVD, she mentions that though they were controversial, she felt that they were more realistic, spoke more to real-life average people, than Brooke Shields' highly glamorous scenes in THE BLUE LAGOON and ENDLESS LOVE, which she felt were just too pretty. Yeah, Jennifer's really cute, and lots of girls would be able to relate to that supremely inglorious botched sex scene.Phoebe Cates is an unforgettable standout in the annals of movie eroticism. It would take much more to create an iconic scene nowadays than merely filling out a red bikin (and then going topless) but back in 1982, she made bikini history indelibly locked into the minds of the young generation of that time.Without the red bikini sequence, my score would have been considerably lower, as I do not find neither the movie nor most of the characters particularly entertaining. Amy Heckerling did much better with CLUELESS, which ranks as one of my personal favorites.Let me just add that the insane song at the end ""Goodbye, Goodbye"" by Oinka Boinka or something goofy like that, is so atrociously bad, so maddeningly irritating, that if I could break the original and thereby wipe it from recording history, no matter how I would be chastised for it, I'd stomp on the damn thing.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
65,slokes,"Ultimate 80s teen movie...but how good, really?",5,15 December 2003,"People talk about 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' being the representative slice-of-life teen comedy for the early 1980s in the same way 'American Graffiti' depicts the early 1960s and 'Dazed And Confused' the mid-70s. 'Fast Times' deserves special kudos because it came out when the times in question were still taking place - in fact 'Fast Times' would go on to define its era as the must-see comedy for those who made up the movie's subject matter back in late '82 and early '83.Here's my problem: It's not much of a comedy. Sure, it has funny moments, but it's very downbeat too much of the time. The two main female characters, played by Jennifer Jason-Leigh (Stacy) and Phoebe Cates (Linda), give solid performances but have hardly a true laugh between them, other than Cates' simple action of opening a door. The male characters have their funny scenes, too, but in-between acts of such casual cruelty and harshness that it really doesn't compensate. Here's something to ponder: The funniest performance in this film is by a guy whose only other comedies were 'Shanghai Surprise' and 'We're No Angels.' Sean Penn is very good as Spicoli, but he's got the one character you are encouraged to laugh at, him and Ray Walston's Mr. Hand, of course, both hilarious. 'Jefferson was saying if we don't get some cool rules pronto, we'll be bogus, too!' When they aren't in the film, my attention drifts. As a comedy, it's alternately funny and flailing. As a drama, this is an afterschool special with swear words and nudity.'Fast Times' is fun to watch simply for the time-capsule elements. Writer Cameron Crowe really had his ear to the ground as he took measure of a LA-area high school in the guise of a student, and director Amy Heckerling has a clearly sympathetic understanding for the tribal rites of the young. The score is warmed-over '70s mellow guitar rock already past its prime, but offers great songs, none better than Jackson Browne's last great hit, 'Somebody's Baby,' which had its first release on the 'Fast Times' soundtrack (and might be subtitled 'Stacey's Sex Theme' as it shows up whenever she gets it on.) Heckerling doesn't gloss up the sex (the first such scene takes place in a grimy concrete bunker with the memorable graffito 'Surf Nazis' over Stacy's head), and that's to her credit. The film's grittiness works in this way for me because the early '80s seem on retrospect a less innocent time than the earlier eras depicted in the other teen films, the first time in which sex between young people could be truly casual while traditional religious and social strictures seemed to fall mute. In that way, she hits the right notes.But Heckerling accepts this casualness to the point of promulgating it. We see Stacy unabashedly learning about oral sex with a carrot and getting an abortion in which her main source of pain seems to be about getting a ride and money from the guy who knocked her up. With AIDS just around the corner, and a host of moral issues surrounding unbridled sex among minors, I find myself wanting to scream at the screen like Mr. Hand: 'What are you people, on dope?'That's a personal issue a lot of 'Fast Times' viewers won't join me in feeling. What I think is a broader problem is the shallowness of the story lines and the characters, how lacking in deeper resonance they are. As Heckerling points out in her joint DVD commentary with Crowe, Mark (Rat) Ratner is someone who finds sex as difficult as others find trigonometry. He's a nerd, and I can relate, so how is it the attractive, sexually active Stacey chooses him and seeks a relationship with him? Hot girls don't chase nerds, simple as that. The film might have tried to flesh out this relationship and offer some explanation why else she likes him other than his awkward smile, his obvious desire, and his willingness to offer her some encouragement after Mr. Vargas' morgue demonstration, but you are left with a couple of half-finished, awkward conversations and the sense that they had to wind up together because they are the lead actors.'Fast Times' is a fun film to watch, but thin as the soles on a pair of checkered loafers. It's the definitive teen film of its time, but 'Valley Girl' and 'Sixteen Candles' have better narratives, 'The Breakfast Club' more interesting characters, and 'Last American Virgin' a stronger ending. If it was just Sean Penn and Ray Walston sitting at Perry's Pizza for ninety minutes, in a sort of 'My Dinner With Spicoli,' I think 'Fast Times' would have been more fun.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
66,gcd70,Who are we kidding?,4,14 March 2008,"Very typical high school sex-comedy which may pretend to be about more than one thing, but really, who are we kidding? Writer Cameron Crowe (""Say Anything"") and director Amy Heckerling (""Look Who's Talking"") do manage to throw a few side issues in, but their target audience wants sex, and so that is what they get. If this pic is an accurate reflection of youth today, then it's a wonder that every second fifteen year old girl isn't pregnant. Even if it isn't accurate, it's no wonder kids are so promiscuous.""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" isn't any better or worse than other films of this style though. The young cast (including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinhold, Phoebe Cates and Sean Penn) go through their paces, being typical teens - always curious about sex. Aside from that there is little else on their minds. It takes young Stacey (Leigh) all of the 89 minute running time to decide that anybody can have sex, but she just wants a relationship and romance. This of course is not before she loses her virginity (at 15) to some 26 year old jock, and then has another brief encounter with her prospective boyfriend's 'best friend'.

67,dworldeater,"Awesome, totally awesome!",10,27 July 2017,"The 80's had a lot of great teen movies, in my opinion Fast Times In Ridgemont High is one of the best. Sex, drugs and rock n'roll(but mostly the sex) are the prevalent themes for the film. While the movie is hilarious, there are some pretty serious situations that the film takes on(minors having sex with adults, abortion,armed robbery,etc). The tone is mostly light, but very effective when there are serious situations. The cast is excellent and a lot of them went on to have success in the film industry. It should be no surprise that Sean Penn went on to become a big star as he steals the show with his iconic performance of surfer stoner dude Spicolli. Also we get awesome early performances from Judge Reinhold and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Forest Whitaker, Eric Stoltz and Nicolas Cage also appear and lets not forget about major 80's babe Phoebe Cates, who really shines in the pool scene. This is pretty accurate and authentic film about life in high school for teens in the early 80's.

Fast Times at Ridgemont High is Clueless meets Valley Girl. Timeless throughout the generations, this is still a popular movie with the youth market. The typical storyline of drugs, music, sex, friendship, school work and part time jobs is real and emotional for this ""high school"" cast. Most teen movies fail to capture the truth of growing up under the giant umbrella of peer pressure. Unlike most of the pop-culture junk that was produced in the 1990's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is real. From the amazing 80's soundtrack to the wardrobe that the cast dresses in, this movie is like a time capsule. People of this generation can still relate to what it was like growing up in the early 80's in small town / California esq. society. Last but not least, Phoebe Cates will live for a thousand years with her innocent, yet provocative swimming pool / dream sequence. What teenage boy can't help but love this scene!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
69,truemythmedia,Not As Funny as Expected,6,16 September 2019,"This is another of those movies that, if I had seen it at the time it came out and at the right age, I think I would have loved. As it stands, I do like it, but with a whole host of qualifiers.The first qualifier is that I don't think it is very funny at all. I imagine that some of the antics and characters in this movie made people bust a gut the first time they saw it but humor can really suffer the ravages of time and this film is no exception to that common complaint of older movies. On top of that, some of the scenes that were probably the funniest have been spoiled by countless top ten lists and updated versions in more contemporary films (Phoebe Cates sequence and BJ practice.)The second is that this film has some depictions of underage sex that are disturbing, though tame in their execution. It is hard to watch Stacy, a girl who is supposed to be 15, lose her virginity to a guy in his 20s. The actress isn't 15 and the scene is not romanticized or idealized but it also isn't presented for the sad thing that I would hope anyone would consider it to be.So why do I like this film? Several reasons, the first of which is that in high school, I felt a lot like Mark Ratner. I was small, had crushes on girls that were out of my league, and never actually worked up the courage to ask them out. I was embarrassed of my inexperience and didn't think anything could ever change that (in fact nothing ever did but that is another story). Watching his struggle for female attention and his friendship with a guy who ultimately betrays him rings really true for me as does Stacy's story of wanting to find out what this whole 'sex thing' is all about. For many kids who never really get a great understanding of what these relationships are like, the mystery of it, as it is presented in Fast Times, feels very authentic.Another thing I like about the film is the variety of things in the film that are presented accurately. The drudgery of having a job while in high school, the pain in the butt that having a teacher that doesn't like you can be, and the constant obsession over a girl are all very reminiscent of how I view my own high school experiences.Unfortunately, this film has simply not aged well. It is a bit of a time capsule which some may find enjoyable but I wonder how much of it would be relatable to a modern high schooler. Would they find the antics of Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn, ""Tree of Life"") too tame? The worst he does is order a pizza in class. Other than that, the worst he does is show up late for class.In the end, I find myself wishing for more from this film. I want to like it. I want to say that this is a movie that I will revisit many times over my life but the fact of the matter is that I probably won't ever watch it again. It may remind me of high school but other movies do that better and too much of this film is spent wallowing in the parts of that experience that I have come to grips with and moved on from.As a person in my late thirties now, I just don't relate anymore to the angst and hormone driven characters, even if I find them to be well conceived and the film, well executed.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

71,RainDogJr,Funny way to start the year,8,1 January 2008,"This film is about a school year in the life of four teenagers and some of their friends. Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is trying to be with a boy for the first time and for that she will have the help of Linda Barret (Phoebe Cates). Mark Ratner (Brian Backer)is a boy that has an interest in Stacy so with the help of his best friend Mike Damone (Robert Romanus), he is trying to be with Stacy. The plot also involves Stacy's brother, Brad (Judge Reinhold) and Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) who is the kind of punk of the school, that has the best parts in the film and that is the best character.The plot is very simple and is not the best thing in this film but it works because of the cool characters, specially Spicoli. And also because of the previous work of Cameron Crowe, who enter undercover in a High School to write his book and to be closer to the behavior of the students. So the best thing in this film are the dialogs and of course the characters. The are very funny personalities, like the one of Mike Damone, who is like the boy who knows everything about girls and about rock concerts or the one of Brad, that is like a senior and is a successful single. But the one that steals the film is Spicoli, just because he has the funniest scenes in the film and is the most charismatic in the school. With the personality that Sean Penn has right now he must be shame of this character, just watch the episode in ""Two and a half men"" where Sean appears.Conclusion: this is a simple but funny film, excellent for start the year with a smile. That has a cast full of stars in their beginnings: Sean Penn, Nicolas Cage credited as Nicolas Coppola for the first and unique time, Forest Whitaker in a funny role as the best football player in the school and the older brother of Spicoli's friend,Jenifer Jason Leigh,Eric Stoltz and Anthony Edwards. 8 out of 10",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
72,framptonhollis,a wonderful (and deeply misunderstood) movie,10,23 June 2017,"Dealing with teen sexuality in a scandalously frank fashion, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" has become something of a cult classic legend, a film that is considered to be (depending on who you ask) raunchy, funny, disgusting, obscene, brilliant, entertaining, graphic, etc. From my point of view, the hype surrounding the film's sexual elements overshadows what a sensitive and genuine little movie it really is. This is not some stupid teen sex comedy despite what Roger Ebert's 1 star review may have you believe (seriously Roger?!? and don't get me wrong, I love and admire Mr. Ebert's work!); this is not an exploitation flick, this is not a pornographic movie, this is a poignant comedy-drama about the most confusing and complex years of life, the years of teen-hood. ""Fast Times"" refuses to ignore strongly mature and dark themes despite its target audience. It is a realistic film (despite some characters and scenes being obviously over the top), and it has genuine heart. There are moments and jokes of a juvenile nature, there is a great deal of bawdiness, scenes that can easily be considered ribald or ""dirty"", and those scenes are essential for the movie to present to the viewer. The goal of the film is NOT to exploit teenage sexuality, but to observe and comment on it, and, in the end, the movie's message is not about sex, but about love and life in general and this is all depicted in a fashion both humorous and heartfelt. Sean Penn's performance has lived on to become something of a legend, and it continues to be laugh out loud funny to this very day. Every time Penn is on screen, all eyes are on him. Everything from his tone of voice to his facial expression to his body movements is done to a level of pure hilarity; he adds a comedic level to the film unmatched by any other cast members. And the rest of the cast is also splendid! Jennifer Jason Leigh is charming and utterly believable as the film's center heroine, Judge Reinhold is funny and charismatic as her somewhat rebellious older brother, Robert Romanus is cool as hell as the close friend and mentor of the socially awkward Mark Ratner, played with all the nervousness and quirks necessary by Brian Backer, and Vincent Schiavelli is wonderful in one of his many supporting roles as one of Ridgemont High's most interesting teachers. Many other memorable roles and performances are sprinkled all throughout the film that would take forever to mention, so I just suggest anyone reading this just go watch (or re-watch) this beautiful comedy to embrace the full, essential experience.The script is possibly among the finest in film history, as Cameron Crowe further proves that he is one of the finest men working in movies today as he adapts his own book (based on his own experiences) in a manner that only the creator of a film like ""Say Anything..."" could. And Amy Heckerling transfers his script to the screen in a manner that makes me wish she made more movies (not only of this quality, but just in general, because this and ""Clueless"" are two of the most intelligent, entertaining, and funny teen movies ever made). All in all, this is a magical movie, the type of movie that will entertain, provoke, amuse, and inspire no matter what its prudent critics may have you believe about the highly taboo topic of (*gasp*) SEX (!) and even worse the way a TEEN (!) may experience and be concerned with such HIDEOUS (!) matters.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I was just a wee tyke during the later part of that decade, so I don't remember anything about those years. But all the teen movies that I've seen have led me to believe it was an awesome and corny time to be an adolescent.Fast Times at Ridgemont High is one of the iconic movies from that era, and that reputation is richly deserved. It still holds up very well today. It starred younger versions of a bevy of today's biggest stars, like Forest Whitaker and Sean Penn, alongside some of the names that were synonymous with the 80's, like Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe Cates. It's very much an ensemble movie, with a collection of characters and scenarios that range from light-hearted (Penn) to more dramatic (Leigh).   The script was courtesy of the talented Cameron Crowe, who adapted it from a book that he re-entered high school to research as he was writing it. As a result, this wasn't a simple sex romp or teen comedy. Sure, it was pretty funny in parts, but it also dealt with the sometimes heavy issues that teens were wrestling with back then (and are still tackling today). The twists and turns of teenage relationships, unplanned pregnancies, jobs, abortions, and the like, are touched on in a genuine (if simplified) manner. Even so, this movie is a lot more evenly split between comedy and social commentary than The Breakfast Club was, for example.  Movies like Fast Times at Ridgemont High are pretty ageless.

I was hugely surprised by this turn of events at the time because I did have a lot of admiration for Cameron Crowe, but then I saw this and ""Elizabethtown"" in quick succession, which kinda derailed that train somewhat...The main cast all did well enough - I bought into them, they delivered their lines acceptably, etc...

That is not a stupid opinion, only an opinion of someone that has never bothered to rent those comedies from the section of the local video store that gathers dust. Films like the ones mentioned are squalid imitations produced and written by misguided souls that are doing their best to cash in on a genre that has been dead for years. And yet they succeed. But if you want to check out and admire the pioneers of the business, you have to go back to the Encyclopedia of the 80's and look for names like Hughes, Heckerling, Linson, Kouf, Boaz Davidson and so on. There you will find films with titles such as The Breakfast Club, Secret Admirer, The Wild Life, Mischief, Last American Virgin and Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Disguising today's excuse for teen comedies as honest attempts to delve into the psyche of today's youth is nothing but chicanery and should be uncovered for what it really is. Just a cheap knock off.Fast Times is the ultimate high school comedy that features everything from subtle observations like kids sniffing freshly photocopied paper to more overt gestures like teens and young sex. The films was written by a young Cameron Crowe, who has gone on to be famous with films like Say Anything and Jerry Maguire. But back in the early 80's he returned to high school in cognito to observe teens and their rituals and the result was his book based on his studies. Some of the students were so angered at his film because they said that his characters were to much like the ones he knew and hung out with. And if that is true, can you imagine what it was like to know a guy like Jeff Spicolli? Here is one of the all time funniest characters that has now been imitated to the point of banality. Here is a guy that wants nothing more than to have sex, smoke some weed, drink some beer and squeak by in his World History class. Oh yea, and surfing is his passion. I don't think we were prepared for a character like Spicolli because I have never seen an imitation of him done quite right. He is the perfect caricature of the 80's surfer dude. As one of his classmates says, "" This guys been stoned since the third grade. ""If the Spicolli character is the comic genius of Fasttimes, the rest of the cast is the reality. There is a pallet of interesting characters played by young and energetic, soon to be famous stars that started their careers in this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates, Judge Reinhold, Forrest Whitaker, Sean Penn and even lesser known faces like Anthony Edwards, Eric Stoltz and Nicolas Cage all started in this film. Look at where they are today.Fast Times is the blueprint of any film that wants to capitalize on the teen market. There is well thought out comedy, painstaking relationships, the rah-rah bravado of high school sports, the essential prom night, sex, drugs, rock and roll and of course the excitement of working at the coolest place in the mall. This is one of the funniest yet most poignant films about high school and growing up. If you think the Godfather is the Bible of all mafia movies, Halloween is the godfather of horror films and Raiders of the Lost Ark is the pioneer of action films, then you will understand that Fast Times at Ridgemont High is THE original high school flick. For those who think any film released in the late 90's or early 00's ( with the exception of American Pie ) is the best you can get, then please do yourself a favour, see this film. There is no contest. Every idea in todays films has been borrowed from the great ones from only a couple of decades ago. Look no further than this great movie. It is the one to watch.10 out of 10",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
79,DunnDeeDaGreat,Number #2 in my list of teen movies,8,14 January 2002,"You can't call yourself a teenager if you haven't see Fast Times at Ridgemont High . The film is required viewing for teens of the eighties, nineties, seventies or any time period. Cameron Crowe made a film that teens can relate that still stands the test of time. I would love to go to Ridgemont and hang out with Spocolit, Brad Hamltion & Mike Damone. I would also love to get Linda Barret and Stacy Hamltion in the sack. For their nude scenes the film gets a 10.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
80,mattymatt4ever,A real treat,7,27 April 2001,"A movie like this may be ""slightly"" outdated.  I'm sure this movie fared better with the teens and pre-teens of the eighties/the ""Me"" Generation. However--being that I saw it just recently--I thought it was very good and very original.  You can spot up-and-coming stars of the present like Sean Penn, Forrest Whitaker and if you look really quickly--Nicolas Cage.  The film definitely has some memorable characters, including Jeff Spicolli--played amusingly by Penn.  It's nice to see Penn--who's usually credited for serious roles--in a light comic persona.  I've always been a big fan of the music of that decade.  In that area, I cannot be disappointed.  The film opens with the great Go-Go's hit ""We Got the Beat."" There are landmark moments, like Spicolli ordering pizza into a classroom. And there is the famous Judge Reinhold masturbation scene in which he dreams of Phoebe Cates--who looked EXTREMELY HOT back then!--rising from the swimming pool, about to romance him.  That, in a way, continued the slowly-growing fad of the gross-out comedy, first spawned by ""Animal House"" in 1978.  I'm sure I can't totally relate to the characters in this movie, though they are well drawn-out.  However, I'm sure anybody who has been a teenager in the decade can.  I like how the teenage characters in eighties movies, compared to those of now, are a lot more...real!  In teen movies nowadays, you see these polished blondie bimbos with no zits or any facial blemishes.  They all look like Barbie Dolls.  If you compare the girls in eighties movies to those of the nineties and the millenium--there's a huge difference!  ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is a very funny comedy that is a sheer treat and will make you feel refreshed.  It's a bigger treat for people who grew into adolescence during that decade, but it's still fun for everybody. 
My score:  7 (out of 10)",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
81,hall895,Dude!,7,19 June 2010,"Nowadays we could all use a little Jeff Spicoli in our lives. Sean Penn sure could. This movie proves that once upon a time Penn was actually capable of enjoying himself and engaging in some good, lighthearted fun. His stoned surfer dude Spicoli is such a great character. Sometimes there's nothing more to life than ""Hey bud, let's party!"" If only life were always so simple. For Spicoli perhaps it is. But some of the other characters we meet will have to confront some rather serious issues. And with that this movie sets itself a bit apart from so many other teen comedies. The laughs are there. Thank you Mr. Penn for that. But the serious moments interspersed throughout really make you feel for the characters. And that is what ultimately makes the film a success.Everyone remembers Penn's Spicoli. And, probably because of one scene in particular, everyone remembers Phoebe Cates. Perhaps overlooked is Jennifer Jason Leigh who may actually be the real standout performer here. In portraying the innocent freshman Stacy Hamilton, who is rather eager to lose that innocence, Leigh gives a very assured performance. A challenging role to play and Leigh fits the part perfectly. Playing Stacy's older friend Linda, who would have us believe she is much more wise in the ways of love than her young counterpart, Cates is perfectly fine. But her character doesn't have nearly as much going on as Leigh's. Overall there is a fine group of young performers on display. Plenty of familiar faces and a few relative unknowns too. And seemingly everyone involved does very well. But, with the possible exception of Penn off in his own little Spicoli world, it's Leigh who comes off best.The movie is a nice little slice of early 1980s high school life. It definitely has that unique 1980s look and feel to it. There's really not all that much in the way of plot but there is enough to keep you engaged for 90 minutes. You've got the very good young cast of characters and there's room for a few memorable performances from an elder generation as well. How can you not love Ray Walston as Mr. Hand? And Vincent Schiavelli as Mr. Vargas too. Whenever the movie threatens to bog down a bit, and there are a few moments where it does, it's Spicoli to the rescue. Oh, that wacky Sean Penn. Penn gives the movie some laughs, Leigh gives it some heart and everyone around them does their part to keep things headed in the right direction. This is not just another run of the mill teen comedy. This one's a little more than that. A great film? Probably not. But so much better than so many others like it.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
82,CitizenCaine,Fast Times A Harbinger For Worse Times,5,9 December 2009,"Although Fast Times At Ridgemont High boasts a long list of now more famous actors and actresses and has this seemingly nostalgic feel for some folks who grew up in the era depicted, it remains a shallow, hit or miss teenage comedy about growing up in or around southern California, circa 1979 to 1980. Writer Cameron Crowe revisited a high school, posed as a student, and wrote the book upon which this film is based. The trouble is the story and experiences in the film are in no way indicative of the average high school experience. Each character is a stereotype, with the exception of Reinhold as Brad. There's even a token black character: Forest Whitaker plays a ferocious high school football player not around long enough to make the mostly white demographic uncomfortable.The film is notable for giving several actors their start, including Nicholas Cage in his film debut working at the burger shack with Judge Reinhold. Anthony Edwards and Eric Stoltz are Penn's fellow potheads. James Russo appears as a robber near the end of the film. Director Martin Brest plays a doctor. The film moves swiftly from one vignette to the next with Adam Sandler-like hit or miss accuracy. There are some funny scenes to be sure, just as there are several vulgar scenes. Ray Walston, as Mr. Hand, is an oppressive disciplinarian history teacher made fun of back then but sorely lacking in today's schools now.Director Amy Heckerling had her pick of the litter of up and coming young actors and actresses for the film. Jennifer Jason Leigh is appealing as Stacy, the average high school girl. Judge Reinhold is well cast as Leigh's brother Brad, the guy with ""the car"" in high school. Phoebe Cates is perfect as the seemingly more experienced bomb shell girl. Sean Penn, as Spicoli, sets off an unfortunate chain of events that resonate to this day, culminating in a whole generation of parents just as irresponsible and obnoxious as the Penn character was in this film. Now instead of a class with one character like Spicoli, we have entire schools full of Spicolis and 40-50 year old adults spouting the word ""awesome"" every few minutes. That's progress. ** of 4 stars.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

85,gab-14712,"A Honest, Hilarious Portrayal of High School Life!",9,6 July 2019,"After viewing Fast Times at Ridgemont High, my first thought was ""Why are all history teachers portrayed in media evil?"" Such an odd thought, but a worthy thought given my own experience. All of my history teachers/professors were cool, but I guess Hollywood has a thing against history. That said, I did like Mr. Hand and his paranoia of everyone being high on dope. Anyhow, this 1982 film is essentially the American Graffiti of the 1980's. It is a realistic, honest portrayal of how high school life was like back then. My high school life was a good twenty-five years after the film, but I can relate to the themes, because all generations go through the same thing. Love, betrayal, abortion, poor jobs-well, everyone knows how that is like. This decade is well-known for its teen comedies, so Amy Heckerling's film was the one to kick everything off.The movie was written by future filmmaker Cameron Crowe based on his adventures of growing up in a California high school. He tackles all the important elements of what makes growing up unique. The film really does not have a plot, per se. It's all about the characters, how they deal with the everyday life of home, school, and work. Maybe it is just best to introduce the characters. Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) is your laidback surfer dude whom history teacher Mr. Hand despises. I guess that is what happens when you order pizza in the middle of class, eh? Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) is a guy everyone expects a lot out of, but he works at various fast food places and doesn't know what he wants in life. His younger sister, Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a teen virgin and she wants to find her first love. Her role model and best friend is Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) who is a very confident young woman. Working at a movie theater, Mark Ratner (Brian Backer) is one of the nerdy types, but he does have a big crush on Stacy. The dream of his is broken when he is betrayed his friend Mike Damone (Robert Romanus), who scalps tickets for a living.As you see, there are many characters whose stories we get to follow. The above characters are only the main ones, as there are many important characters here. The performances are all wonderful because the actors made them realistic. Of course, Crowe's sharp screenplay captured the highs and lows of life during high school very well. If anything, I could relate to many of these characters at one point or another. Sean Penn gave the best performance of the film. The guy is just so chill, and it's really funny that he ordered pizza during class. I enjoyed watching Judge Reinhold as Brad. His attitude working at these fast food places is spot on. I loved when he told that business customer that he is not right. Way to go, dude! Jennifer Jason Leigh gave a realistic, even heartbreaking performance because her character goes through teen pregnancy drama.I was not expecting heavy drama in such a light-hearted comedy, but Cameron Crowe is known to do that with his films. Maybe that is something he went through, but then idea of abortion is heavily prevalent here. I was very surprised, but I applaud his effort of tackling this issue in the film. I will not go overly political here, but teen pregnancy is an issue that high school kids deal with. It's not fun nor pleasant, but a fact of life. Many critics of the 80's criticized these scenes, but it's something that needs to be talked about, even in today's political environment.Honestly, watching this film made me wish I grew up in the 1980's. Sure, I hung out at the mall a few times, but nothing like this mall. The music/soundtrack adds more to the film's vibe. Nothing like jamming out to the likes of Tom Petty while watching these characters in action. There are many individual scenes that are memorable, but there is a bikini scene that ranks neat the top because of just how awesome and relatable that scene is. The film handles sex in a way that is not too awkward and there is a truly hilarious scene that is an all-time classic. So, definitely keep an open mind! This movie introduces many stars of this decade and the next. Keep an eye out for Nicolas Cage, Anthony Edwards, just to name a few!Overall, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a sharp, moving, and honest portrayal of high school life. If anything, Cameron Crowe's script still holds up very well today. The settings may be different, but the characters are instantly relatable and that will never change. That is the reason I enjoyed watching this movie so much-the relatable characters. In the decade that spawned relentless amounts of teen movies, this ranks in the upper echelon.My Grade: A-",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
86,SmileysWorld,High school was never like this.,5,7 March 2009,"The only thing this film represents to me is teens being irresponsible.It does not represent high school as I saw it,though I have no doubt that some of the people around me were living this way.The film's messages are clear:Drug use,premarital sex and abortion are okay.Since I don't agree with any of that,I have to say that I do not find the film even remotely entertaining or even the least bit amusing.The only compliment I can give it is that it is solid proof that Sean Penn has had a very special gift when it comes to acting from the very beginning.However,the film's above mentioned lack of entertainment value will keep me from viewing the film again.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

88,bellino-angelo2014,Very decent generational movie,7,10 February 2021,"I was very curious about this movie because it's considered by many a cult generational movie about american teens of the beginning of the 1980s and also because it has been the debut of many future major stars (such as Sean Penn, Nicolas Cage in a bit role, Forest Whitaker, Judge Reinhold and Anthony Edwards). I finally saw it a few months ago and, while I didn't found it excellent, I still liked it.The film focuses on various characters, but mostly on Jeff Spicoli (Penn) and Brad Hamilton (Reinhold). Spicoli is a stoned surfer who loves to skip school and run afoul of his strict history teacher Mr. Hand (Ray Walston) and loves to drug himself with his best friends (Edwards and Eric Stoltz). He even ends up wrecking the car of sports athlete Charles Jefferson (Whitaker) who being very angry manages to win the game and before the graduation dance he has to suffer 8 hours of private lessons by his teacher, and he'll finally understand the lesson. Brad Hamilton is a senior at Ridgemont High School who has to finish the studies. He works at the All-American Burger but after a while is fired after insulting a costumer, and of course he is suddenly left by his girlfriend. After a while he obtains a job at a convenience store and he is promoted as the manager after foiling a robbery with the help of Spicoli who came by casually.This movie has aged well. The performances by the then unknown actors are very good (especially Penn's), the soundtrack has some very cool songs of its time (my favourite is GOODBYE GOODBYE) and despite a few dirty scenes, the movie is fun. It's just a generational movie that today would probably be enjoyed by teens (including myself since I was still 21 when I saw it). And it's also a great time capsule for its time.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
89,Maziun,Good teen comedy,6,2 October 2013,"I usually don't watch teen comedies . Mostly for the reason that they aren't too bright or funny . They mostly have toilet humor and unsympathetic characters . So , I wasn't thrilled when I've read the summary for this movie . I decided to give a try , since people were praising it very much and because I have soft spot for anything 80's related.""Fast times at Ridgemont high"" isn't a deep or even too bright movie . It's a story about American teenagers who wants to party , have sex and go shopping . I don't know how accurate is this portrayal of American youth . The characters are mostly clichés , yet the actors do a good job of making them likable.The best performance of movie belongs to Sean Penn (Yes , THIS Sean Penn) . Before he became a serious actor (and a serious asshole) he created one of the funniest characters ever – Jeff Spicoli . A surfer who isn't too smart . He likes to get stoned , good party , everything that is awesome and doesn't worry about anything . He's incredibly cool . I mean how could you not like a guy who orders pizza on his history lesson ? I was pleasantly surprised to see Judge Reinhold (Roosewood from ""Beverly Hills cop"") as good hearted Brad Hamilton , Forest Whitaker (""Ghost dog"") as aggressive football player Charles Jefferson and even Anthony Edwards (""Top gun"") as stoner bud .Other good performances come from Jennifer Jason Leigh (the delicate Stacy) , Brian Bacler ( the shy Mark) , Robert Romanus ( womanizer Mike) , Phoebe Cates (arrogant Linda) and Ray Waltson ( grim teacher Mr. Hand).The movies most memorable scene is the Brad's dream sequence with half naked Linda . I think that is a really sexy scene , but not the sexiest scene ever . There is also some nudity and lot of talks about sex here , so people who don't like this kind of stuff shouldn't watch the movie.The jokes aren't especially sophisticated , but they are funny and with good taste . ""Fast times"" is very 80's in style (music , hairstyles , ending credits) and for me it's a good thing. There are some nice songs here : Jackson Browne Somebody's baby"" , The Go Go's We got the beat"" , Oingo Boingo ""Goodbye goodbye"" , Jimmy Buffett ""I don't know (Spicolli's theme)"" , Led Zeppelin ""Kashmir"" and Reeves Nevo and The Cinch ""Wooly bully"".The movie mostly wants to entertain the audience , but thankfully there is some message here. Sex is fun , but love is more important . Also sex means responsibility. The relationship between Stacy and Mark proves that.It's a good fun . I give it 6/10.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

But I still believe this is the best schoolyard melodrama around and it still makes me laugh with its home truths and clever one lines.(""You want romance, we can't even get cable TV!"")Sean Penn is a standout as the stoned surfer who, sadly, lives nowhere near the sea. I don't believe any teacher would take time to go around anyone's house (as here) to continue the lessons, but it is a funny scene! What was presented here was taken as a model for other films that tried to boost up the sex, comedy or drama - but this film is a lesson in balance and stepping lightly that others missed. Nothing is too big a deal - not even abortion.Fast Times was a lot of fun when I saw it twenty years ago and is still fun today. True many of the actors went on to do even better work, so it is great to see them when they still had their own front teeth and even a bit of puppy fat.This is especially true of the great Jennifer Jason Leigh - one of the best American actresses of her generation.

It can also be (obviously)noted that like Graffiti, many members of the cast went on to have very succesful careers.
The film isn't supposed to be much more than a fun comedy about high schoolers in the eighties and by that measure it succeeds as a film.

A clever screenplay by Cameron Crowe, based on his own undercover masquerade as a high school student and spirited direction by Amy Heckerling help to keep this classic fresh and funny 25 years after its release and with a perfect, hand-picked cast, some of whom became big stars: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the virginal Stacy Hamilton; Judge Reinhold as her big man on campus older brother Brad; the luscious Phoebe Cates as Stacy's girlfriend Linda, who offers Stacy lots of bad advice on men; Ray Walston as the hard-nosed history teacher who thinks all of his students are on dope; Robert Romanus as Mike Damone, the skirt-chasing ticket scalper, and shining above all in the role that made him a star, Sean Penn as the perpetually stoned Jeff Spicoli. Crowe and Heckerling seamlessly interlace these characters through multiple story lines to great effect.

97,FlickJunkie-2,The Quintessential High School Flick,9,2 July 2000,"Fast Times' is the quintessential high school flick.  What American Graffiti' did to put high school films on the map, Fast Times' did to expand and redefine the genre.  Every hijinks film that has succeeded in recent history owes a debt of gratitude to this film for resetting the boundaries.This is an adaptation of Cameron Crowe's book about his undercover high school experience.  What differentiates Fast Times' from its predecessors is its realism, since it was based on the actual experiences of real kids. The skits weren't as outrageous as other high school flicks, and indeed this wasn't that funny a film.  But it struck a chord, because of its frank depiction of the issues with which kids really struggle.This film was controversial from the start.  Universal almost didn't release it because they thought it would bomb.  Profanity, nudity and sexual situations were just not done in high school films.  This was the first such film to earn an R rating.  It was actually rated X until they toned down the sex scene between Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Mike (Robert Romanus). The studio was sure that the only audience the film had would be prohibited from seeing it.  Finally, Universal agreed to release it on the west coast only with no promotional budget.  It exploded and the rest is history.Though this was an ensemble project, the film really belonged to Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold.  All three gave outstanding performances and went on to successful acting careers.  This part was perfect for Penn who has made a career of playing offbeat maverick types. Penn may have peaked in this film, not because his skills have diminished, but because he has not and may never again find a role into which he can slip so seamlessly.  Jennifer Jason Leigh did not one, but two nude sex scenes; a very gutsy move for a 20 year old actress at the time.  In this film she became a model for the sweet girl trying to lose her innocence.    
Reinhold spring boarded off this film to land numerous successful roles in the 1980's and 90's most notably the Beverly Hills Cop series of films.  The film also helped launch successful careers for Eric Stolz, Forrest Whittaker, Phoebe Cates and Anthony Edwards.  Nicholas Cage was also an extra in this film and was director Amy Heckerling's second choice for Spicoli.  She went with Penn because Cage (then going by Nicholas Coppola) was only 17, and he was limited as to how many hours he could work because he was a minor.The DVD has an interesting retrospective, produced very recently, where the director and many of the actors give their stories of the making of the film.  The only disappointment with the DVD was that they didn't go back and re-master the sound, which was still mono.This film changed the landscape for high school films.  Though it has been eclipsed by numerous more recent films, it stands as a trailblazer that made them all possible.  I rated it a 9/10.  Anyone who liked Clueless' or American Pie' and hasn't seen Fast Times' should go back and see where it all started.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

100,BlackJack_B,Great for teens but not for adults.,6,11 January 2015,"I have seen Fast Times At Ridgemont High plenty of times in the last 30 years. It was very popular on late night T.V. in the 1980's (the edited version) and then the theatrical version years later on when T.V. was allowed to air the R-rated version. I enjoyed this film more as a teen but as a middle-aged man, the movie just isn't as entertaining. I would recommend FTARH to teenagers and young adults but not to those who were kids back in 1982.Still, to see a cast with 3 future Oscar winners in Sean Penn (I Am Sam, Milk), Forest Whitaker (The Last King Of Scotland) and Nicolas Coppola Cage (Leaving Las Vegas) makes FTARH noteworthy. The battle of wits between Jeff Spicoli and Ray Walston's Mr. Hand are very entertaining. It was clear back in 1982 that Sean Penn was destined for a successful career in Hollywood. The stoned out California surfer dude was perfected by Penn and for years people have made that stock character a part of many films, television shows and cartoons.Many years later, lad mags would push Phoebe Cates' famous nude scene as the most perfect display of breasts ever. That one point of the film, you truly feel that you're in an alternate universe when she undoes her top and presents her beautiful assets all shiny and wet to the viewer. That scene never gets old and to this day Ms. Cates is a legend to many young men.The acting is still solid, the music is 1980's and pretty much every character is likable. There's little to fault about it other than the questionable decision to have Amy Heckerling direct this. I just feel the film is better for teenagers. I would recommend finding Cameron Crowe's book and reading that (or seeing Animal House) instead of this film unless you love seeing Spicoli and Barrett over and over again.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
101,chunkylefunga,Very dated.,4,31 August 2021,"Well I finally got around to watching this movie and I've gotta say I was a bit disappointed.I thought the movie would be quirky and funny but it's pretty much average in most areas and pretty dated.Calling someone a fagjust makes it hard to sympathise with a character.But pushing the blatant homophobia aside, I was just bizarre that they've got a character who is 15 and she spends half the movie topless, and loses her virginity to a 26 year old? That's just blatant noncing and just very weird to watch.I will give the movie kudos for actually having an abortion in the movie (albeit without any mental fallout for the poor kid) in a time when America was very backwards about abortion laws.Overall it's an average movie. Sure it may have been funny and relevant in the 80s but I can only watch this movie in my young, modern eyes and sadly this movie does not hold up.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
102,OriginalMovieBuff21,A good teen flick of the 80's,8,21 June 2006,"Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a story about a group of California teenagers who enjoy a variety of things such as sex, malls, and rock n' roll. This film is very enjoyable and for its running time at 90 minutes, I thought it flew by extremely fast and maybe that's why it got its title. Fast Times introduced us to two new people that have changed the course in films today. One an actor by the name of Sean Penn who played the stoner, Jeff Spicoli who loved spoking pot, surfing, and irritating Mr. Hand. Later on Sean Penn became a huge star in movies like Mystic River, 21 Grams, and The Thin Red Line. The other being a writer and director who wrote the screenplay for this film and wrote and directed other hits like Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. He goes by the name of Cameron Crowe. Overall, this is a very entertaining and funny teen flick of the 80's that boosted a lot of careers up for some people that were involved in the film. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
103,raypdaley182,pretty rubbish,1,6 October 2007,"this is a film that American thirty somethings seem to rave about. It might have been a good movie when it was released but it has no plot, FAR too much dialogue and almost nothing happens.Basically the film follows the lives of students at Ridgemont High as they try to live and learn and survive school. Judge Reinhold stars and looks FAR TOO OLD to be going to school. Appearances by Phoebe Cates (who briefly appears nude), Jennifer Jason Leigh (who I still have no idea who she is) (also has 2 nude scenes), Forest Whitacker as a Jock, Sean Penn as a stoner, Eric Stoltz as one of his friends.The cast have all gone on to bigger and better things and films like this have been spoofed many times since.The film can't be sold on it's plot (there is virtually none at all), it can't be sold on the then pretty unknown cast, the music isn't very good for an 80's film and the nudity isn't enough to carry a generally poor film which hasn't stood up well to the passage of time.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

It's fun to see some soon to be stars before they made it big but the content is not handled in a very fun way.Take the character of Stacy Hamilton. Either she is totally out of it or the screenplay didn't know how to service her character. She comes out looking pretty messed up by the end. I suspect that her character was merely meant to schock and break taboos. Like the director said: Hey, look what you can show on film that you couldn't before. It's quite amazing that the director is a woman.There is of course Sean Penn. He is the only character that goes through something that is both funny and oddly believable. It is definitely the most funny performance of his entire career and he plays well with Ray Walston as Mr. Hand.The rest, Brian Backer, Phoebe Cates and especially Judge Reinhold are pretty terrible. Phoebe Cates does have an exceptional nude scene (wonder if Kevin Kline ever saw it?) and she is pretty cute to look at. Judge Reinhold gets humiliated all through to the end. Who wants to see a realistic robbery in a teen comedy? Oh, well. It gave James Russo something to do.So, mixed genres doesn't always a good movie make. But see it and judge for yourself.

But the entire show is stolen by two people: Ray Walston and Sean Penn. Walston plays the now infamous and legendary Mr. Hand. Aloha. Penn plays the even more legendary pizza munching, pot smoking, surfer Jeff Spicoli. His portrayal of this stoner belongs in the movie pothead hall of fame. With Cheech, Chong, Fonda, Hopper, and numerous others. The malls, the music, the clothes are pure 80's. This is probably the Easy Rider of it's generation.

These are characters that work and had ideas. The women in this film didn't want romance, they wanted sex and fast. There are two heroes in this film: to begin my list, Jeff Spicoil(sean pean) as the stoner student that doesn't give a damn like these other kids about work or sex(except naked chicks), all he cares about his smoking dope, having a nice buzz, crusing the streets and surfboarding. The best scene with him is when he orders his pizza in Mr. Hand's class. I wish I could've done that in Government class. The second hero is Rat. What makes him my second hero in the film is that, when he is out with stacy in the first date, stacy tries to hurry things by having sex. But, Rat gets out of the situation.
there is no hurry for sex or working.

109,romanorum1,A Trailblazing Teen Film,7,2 December 2015,"This cult classic is based upon the book by Cameron Crowe who at age 22 in 1979 went undercover as a senior at Clairemont High School in San Diego to write his book, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A True Story."" In the book Crowe focused on six characters. There is no movie plot, just several vignettes that focus on the key characters. As we shall see, the main movie characters – Linda, Stacy, Jeff, Mike, Mark, and Brad – represent different teen types.The opening movie credits swing with the Go-Go's ""We Got the Beat"" as we see the multi-tiered Ridgemont Mall as the backdrop. The camera proceeds to follow the main characters in their various activities: preparing food at Perry's Pizza, waiting on customers, buying movie tickets, watching people pass by, etc. At the arcade young people play old-time video games, like Asteroids and Space Invaders.Then we begin to meet the characters close-up; it is late summer/early fall. Two girls, Linda Barrett and Stacy Hamilton (Phoebe Cates and Jennifer Jason Leigh, respectively) discuss the latest heartthrob, Ron Johnson, a stereo salesman. Linda, the experienced one, coaches Stacy Hamilton, who tells folks that she is 19, but is really 15. In the high school, Mr. Hand (Ray Walston) knows how to control his American History class. The Biology teacher, Mr. Vargas (Vincent Schiavelli), is a little flaky. ""Stoned since the third grade"" slang talking' surfer Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn), late to Hand's history class, is a space- shot who occupies another world. Mike Damone (Robert Romanus), hustler and ticket scalper, is a smooth talker, but in reality is insecure; like Linda tutoring Stacy, he coaches his buddy, the nerd Mark ""Rat"" Ratner (Brian Backer) in how to handle Stacy, with whom he has a crush. Rat is a ticket-taker at the mall's movie theater. Believing that having sexual intercourse is a rite of passage into acceptance, Stacy sneaks out at night and has a hot date with the older Ron. She bears her breasts for the camera and has sex in a baseball dugout. Stacy's brother Brad (Judge Reinhold) works in several fast food joints and wears the hats to prove it. He drives a blue Buick LeSabre and practices in a bathroom mirror how to disengage from girlfriend Lisa (Armanda Wyss). Brad is destined to suffer several humiliations. After the scene switches to the Christmas season, Damone saves Rat's date at a restaurant with Stacy when he retrieves his wallet (that Rat forgot) at his house. Stacy again yearns for sex, but Rat runs away. Using Charles Jefferson's (Forest Whitaker) Chevy Camaro, Jeff drives like a maniac and totals it. Thinking that his car was wrecked by the folks at Lincoln High, Jefferson destroys them at a football game (42-0). In the early spring, Linda at a pool with Stacy exposes her magnificent breasts in a classic scene from the 1980s. Brad masturbates over her in a fantasy daydream sequence, but Linda catches him and grosses out when she opens the bathroom door. Jeff orders a pizza at history class, but Mr. Hand takes it away and passes it out to others. Mike Damone scores with Stacy in an unsatisfying sexual encounter. She promptly gets pregnant and nonchalantly has an abortion. Later there is a confrontation in the gym between Mike and Mark. At a field trip to the local hospital, Stacy gets sick after viewing an autopsy by Mr. Vargas, but is helped by Mark, her partner in Bio class. But it is unrealistic to believe that this swinging chick would be attracted to such a nerd (it just doesn't happen). Her likability is questionable. In the late spring final exam dates are posted. At the senior dance Mike and Mark make up and become friends again, although Mike's status has dropped a notch. Jeff passes his forced oral exam with Mr. Hand and misses the dance; the two seem almost amiable. Linda gets stood up by her far-away boyfriend and cries. The seniors dance to Wooly Bully. At a mart, Brad foils a robbery attempt; Jeff inadvertently helps. The ending – epilogue sequence – tells us the near future of the main characters, which will not be revealed here. Directed by Amy Heckerling, this film is generally an honest one of how teens acted in the early 1980s. There are several sight gags and various observations on romance, sex, drug use, rock 'n' roll, cheating on tests, destruction of property, abortion, and alienation of teens and adults. Character development is at a high level and Sean Penn steals every scene he's in (even though his character is ignoble); he would emerge as a big star, as did Nicholas Coppola/Cage. Ray Walston is solid as the stalwart history teacher. Except for Phoebe Cates (and Nicholas Coppola in a minor role), the high school students were well into their twenties. On a down note, several sets were more graphic then they had to be; they were degrading and disturbing. Did 20-year old Jennifer Jason Leigh really have to appear nude? And what about her 15-year old character who has an abortion? But, already at age 19 in her big screen debut, she appeared topless in ""Eyes of a Stranger"" (1981) where her character, both blind and deaf, was stalked by a serial rapist-murderer. Now, could not Cates/Leigh's carrot-munching scene in the cafeteria been handled differently? Did we really have to see those close-ups of Brad in the bathroom during the pool scene? Had our culture already degenerated? The Universal film was understandably R-rated. Despite some raised issues and eyebrows, the film remains entertaining for mature audiences. In 2005 it was added to the American National Film Registry as culturally significant for permanent preservation.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

It's a bit clichéd and cheesy, but you have to keep in mind that this is the film that created most of those clichés. I really love how it studies the different groups of teenagers from the pothead surfers to the fast-food workers to the regular Joe's. Even more so, I love how it studied the various pressures of High School and how these affect the teens involved. It subtly does a deep investigation on the pressures of drugs, sex, careers and school through very different, but very similar and relatable stories of youth.

112,ericrnolan,"""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982) is actually slow and will leave you feeling low.",2,27 December 2017,"""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982) is a pop-culture scared cow that needs to be skewered. I'd rate it a 2 out of 10 for being a surprisingly inept and poorly scripted 1980's ""classic.""I just don't understand the fervent popular reverence for this movie among people in my age bracket. It was a minor legend when I was growing up. I was a fourth grader in 1982, and gradeschool boys could be divided into two groups: 1) those who had seen the ""Phoebe Cates pool scene"" and 2) those who had not, but wished they had. When I mentioned on social media a couple of months ago this year that I'd never actually gotten around to seeing this movie, my friends were roundly astonished.Why do they think this film is indispensable viewing? Maybe there's something I'm missing. I'm tempted to group ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" together with other beloved 80's films that just don't resonate with me -- like the understandably campy ""Tron"" (1982) or the unexpectedly sleep-inducing ""The Big Chill"" (1983). (I couldn't even finish the latter.) But I can't compare, because I know those movies are objectively good in a lot of ways, even if they weren't to my taste.Nor am I squeamish about raunchy sex comedies. (C'mon.) I pretty fondly remember ""Porky's"" (1981), ""Porky's II: The Next Day"" (1983), and ""Revenge of the Nerds"" (1984). I mentioned ""Porky's"" to the friend with whom I watched ""Fast Times"" -- I told her that it wasn't highbrow entertainment, but I still remember it being crudely, blasphemously funny.This movie was just a thinly scripted small collection of vignettes, with no overall plot outside of teenagers having sexual encounters that are ... awkward and bluntly sad, for the most part. (Sean Penn's character does drugs.) The dialogue is terrible. None of the characters are likable -- even the story's nerdy, well-meaning protagonist is grating.I didn't really laugh once at anything the director intended -- I only laughed at the haircuts and the clothes. I just can't believe that the screenwriter here was Cameron Crowe, who also wrote what is possibly my favorite movie of all time -- the widely but unfairly maligned ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001). (Crowe apparently adapted the screenplay from a novel he wrote.)There is some enjoyment to be had in watching Penn's stoner character. It was fun seeing a well known serious actor in an early comedic role. Penn is a decent character actor, and it looks like he was having fun. I do get why kids in the 80's found him funny.It's also fun seeing the handful of other young actors who would go on to great careers (Judge Reinhold is always funny) but, again, this is something that the filmmakers can't take credit for.Hey, if you want a slice-of-life dramatic comedy about teenagers in the 1980's, then go rent ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985). It wasn't perfect, but it was damn good movie that tackled many of the same issues as this movie, but with intelligence and effective humor. Or, try the oddball ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986). Both movies portray teenagers in the 80's who are smart, likable and emphathetic, in varying degrees. I myself went to high school in the 1980's, and I assure you they were around.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I loved this movie a true classic comedy, even though some of the actor's in the movie are miscast. This movie is a typical coming of age movie, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. I thought the era of the film was more 1970 decade than 1980's. The reason why; first all the promiscuity, music,and drug use; i.e. marijuana. I went to high school in the late 1980's and graduated in 1990. It seems like my generation, wasn't that promiscuous, drugs were out, and dating older guys were a WTF are you doing. Yes there were a couple of girls who did get in trouble like in the movie; but it was a family matter. The part they had to a T was THE MALL. If you were of high school age you went to The Mall or to the skating rink on the weekends.The reason why I liked this movie is because it had and covered everything teenagers experience, the good, the bad, and the consequences of such actions. I thought Spacolli, Sean Penn's character was classic. He and Mr. Hand reminded me of some of the bone headed class-mates I came in contact with and Mr. Hand well I had a few of those teachers in school, LOL.When I watched this movie just this past Saturday, I could have sworn more of it seemed cut this time on TV. I just know when I saw in back in the 80's , more of the iffy scenes were shown back then. I am so against censorship, it's like everything is TABOO to talk about. If we don't talk about these topics we become a Nation of ignorance. Kris L. Cockayne",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
115,mOVIemAN56,Penn is brilliant,10,28 June 2005,"Fast Times could quite possibly be the greatest comedy ever made. After a teacher of mine (in fact a priest) recommended this to me, I decided to rent it. I've never laughed so hard in my life.Fast Times at Ridgemont High is pretty much the story of regular teens and exploring every side of a teenager. Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) is the average pothead trying to have a good time in life. Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) is the over succeeding high school grad, and his little sister, Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is on the verge of being a prostitute in her freshmen year. Well I guess they're not exactly typical high school students. There really is no plot. All the filmmakers do are taking the viewer through a year in the lives of these people. While Reinhold and Leigh are very strong and funny Penn is the reigning champ over all of them. His one liners and the constant dispute with the new teacher, Mr. Hand (Ray Walston) makes him quite possibly the funniest character I've ever seen. He is the definition of cool in my book and the king of comedy.The film in my mind should have been rated NC-17 for everything in the film. There is sexual references left and right, nudity, language, etc. but if you don't have a problem with any of that then you'll enjoy it. While I'm writing, there are also the births of two now major actors in Forest Whitaker as the all-star football player who would kill if anything happened to his car and Nicolas Cage who is one of Spicoli's pothead friends. Trying to explain all of the jokes would be really stupid so I'll just leave it there. This is probably the funniest comedy I've ever seen. It is very original and has so many laughs that you're hurting afterwards.Fast Times at Ridgemont Highs.

Yet while the mall is an experience, none have dared attempt to write the mall epic as say Hotel. did for the hotel industry. Malls have been used as a backdrop in two significant movies: Fast Times at Richmont High and Dawn of the Dead.""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" defined the life of a teenager in the eighties. All the usual teenage problems are vividly satirized and detailed with honesty and realism: teenage pregnancy, sex, drugs, first love, teenage breakup, etc...The cast infused the characters seamlessly and with believability in the story of one school year in the life of several teens. This was nothing especially extraordinary it was just...High School and the mall.The film transcended the typical teen movie, music, nerdy teachers, dope, nudity in a burst of the energy and fun of American teen commercialism. The movies' charm lies in its evocation of an environment, the very mall culture I speak off. While the film depicts the happiness, frustration, ugliness, and joy of being a teen during the 80's within a veneer of sophomoric humor, it portrays the ritual rite of passage in the assumption of adult responsibilities, owning cars, working, getting fired, trying to grow up too fast. This is not presented without sugar but in a rather stark, realistic way. The excitement of working at the coolest place in the mall is balanced against responsibility: getting fired and danger: getting robbed.A TV version briefly aired with some of the cast, but the movie's popularity was not strong enough to draw an audience to it.The Galleria which served as the backdrop for the film regrettably is no more. The film was shot in the Sherman Oaks Galleria Mall in Van Nuys California. The mall failed to survive the 1980s and has been demolished.Yet in High Times, the mall itself is not the story; it is the stage, the setting the prop. The people not the backdrop are the story The Mall Genre Could there be such a thing as a mall movie, one like hotel principally about the place? I have concluded the mall could only be a stage not a story in itself.The mall never assumed as with the old first class hotels or department store a personality of its own. The mall swayed with the times and the demands of the market. Thus there never was an internal conflict such as alluded to in A Christmas Carol of a business operation bucking the times to preserve an ideal manner of doing business.The old five star hotels and the family owned department stores which struggled to preserve quality service against the tides of changing, competitive times might be capable of telling such a story as the book and movie Hotel eloquently depicts.The mall as much as I love the excitement of it never grew such firm roots that it itself could be the center of controversy over direction. The mall's sight never transcended nor passed the very next sale.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
117,jcbutthead86,One Of The Greatest Teen Films Of All-Time. An Excellent And Hilarious Classic.,10,11 May 2014,"Fast Times At Ridgemont High is one of the greatest Teen films of all-time,an excellent and hilarious classic. Filled with fine direction,a great ensemble cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack Fast Times At Ridgemont High is Teen films and Coming Of Age movies at their best.Based on Cameron Crowe's book of the same name and Set in Southern California,Fast Times At Ridgemont High tells the story about a year in a High School semester with several students including Jeff Spicoli(Sean Penn),a stoned out surfer who has to deal with stern but fair History teacher Mr. Hand(Ray Walston),Stacey Hamilton(Jennifer Jason Leigh),a 15-year old sophomore who's trying to figure out how to date guys and Brad Hamilton(Judge Reinhold),Stacey's older brother who's a senior in his last year of High School. Jeff,Stacey and Brad and their friends have to deal with growing up as well sex,drugs,Rock N'Roll and the mall.Fast Times At Ridgemont High is a brilliant,hilarious and unforgettable film that is an instant classic the first time you watch it. It's a movie that is not only a landmark film in the Teen movie genre but it also a film that introduced actors who would become famous later on such as Sean Penn,Jennifer Jason Leigh,Judge Reinhold,Phoebe Cates,Forrest Whitaker,Nicolas Cage,Eric Stolz and Anthony Edwards while giving viewers one of the most realistic and accurate movies about High School and Teenage life ever caught on film. Right from the opening credits Fast Times is a movie keeps you glued to the screen giving viewers a movie that is funny and outrageous as well as honest and real showing the strings,arrows and awkwardness of being a Teenager showing the ups,downs,ins and outs of American High School. One of the reasons Fast Times works so well and is a classic is because while the film is set in the early 1980s the film is timeless in the way it deals with Teens because Teenagers no matter what decade or era think about the same things:sex,drugs and Rock N'Roll and that will never change. The episodic nature is wonderful because in Teenage life things are all over the place and Teens go from one day to the next. The Comedy and laughs in Fast Times is truly great,funny and hilarious because the humor has a balance of being wild and over the top while being subtle and smart with some moments and dialog in the movie that are memorable and will have you roaring with laughter. While the movie is funny and hilarious Fast Times can also be dramatic in the way it deals with sex and relationships but it's not always glamorous or romantic but powerful. When Fast Times was released in 1982 some critics called the movie a Sex Comedy because it came out the same year as Porky's but the film is not a Sex Comedy. Yes there is sex and Comedy but Fast Times is more of a Coming Of Age tale about growing up than about a bunch of Teenagers trying to get laid. The teenage characters Fast Times are amazing and memorable because they are not really stereotypes you see in most Teen films but are real people you see in real life and when you see some of the characters whether it's Spicoli,Stacy or Brad you will relate to them because you will feel like you knew characters like that in High School and the main characters have tons of depth and power that adds to the movie's legacy and is one of the many things that make this film the classic that it is. The screenplay by Cameron Crowe is terrific and classic because while some of the dialog is funny some of the dialog feels authentic and accurate almost like a documentary on High School life. With Crowe's dialog you are inside the mind and it's almost you are standing next to the characters and hearing some of the conversations that go on in the film and you feel like none of the dialog is fake. The ending of Fast Times At Ridgemont High is fantastic and iconic giving viewers a funny epilogue on what happens to the some of characters after the movie ends. A wonderful conclusion.The cast is great in their roles. Sean Penn is excellent,hilarious and at his best in his star making role as Jeff Spicoli,with Penn being funny,iconic and unforgettable. Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific and sweet as Stacy Hamilton,a young sophomore. Judge Reinhold is wonderful as Brad Hamilton,a senior who's Stacy's older brother. Richard Romanus is delightful and smooth as Mike Damone,a ticket scalper. Brian Backer is fantastic as Mark 'Rat' Ratner,Damone's friend who has a crush on Stacy. Phoebe Cates is outstanding and sexy as Linda,Stacy's older best friend that gives her advice about boys. Ray Walston is sensational and hilarious as Mr. Hand,a History teacher and has great scenes with Penn. Vincent Schiavelli is amazing and funny as Mr. Vargas,a Science teacher. Scott Thomson(Arnold),Amanda Wyss(Lisa)and D.W Brown(Ron Johnson)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for early roles from Forrest Whitaker(Charles Jefferson),Nicolas Cage(Brad's Bud),Eric Stolz(Stoner Bud),Anthony Edwards(Stoner Bud),Taylor Negron(Pizza Guy)and James Russo(Robber). The direction by Amy Heckerling is fine,with Heckerling bringing a simple but effective style to the film and using a hand-held documentary feel to the movie. Good direction,Heckerling.The soundtrack is amazing with songs by The Go-Go's(We Got The Beat,Speeding),Led Zeppelin(Kashmir),Tom Petty(American Girl),Stevie Nicks(Sleeping Angel),Jackson Browne(Somebody's Baby),Rayvns(Raised On The Radio),Onigo Boingo(Goodbye,Goodbye),Jimmy Buffett(I Don't Know),Don Henley(Love Rules),Sammy Hagar(Fast Times At Ridgemont High),Reeves Nevo & The Clinch(Wooly Bully,Life In The Fast Lane),Billy Squier(Fast Times,Best Years of Our Lives)Timothy B. Schmit(So Much In Love)and more. An outstanding soundtrack.In final word,if you love Teen Movies,Coming Of Age Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Fast Times At Ridgemont High,an excellent,hilarious classic that you can watch again and again.

Well as teen movies goes it has the followingHooters Virgin who loose their virginity Teenage sex Slightly crazy teacher Hooters A stoner Virgins who remain virgins And of course more hooters.But like Saturday night fever it also has a story that has true elements and characters that you really care about.The crazy teacher is someone you like as much as you like to make fun of. The virgins don't delve don't go into a long self analysis before having or not having sex, they just do or do not have sex. There are no horrible jocks to be destroyed, only one jock hero who is fooled into being an even greater hero.And except one scene with bare breasts the nudity is integral to the story. Why is this, because Cameron Crowe wrote a book based on his time in school as a young looking 25 year old journalist. The movie hasn't aged because it takes the characters journey's very seriously and many of these themes still exist today. In addition it does not take the 1980s seriously. In fact as I watched it I had to check the release date to make sure it wasn't a late 1990s movie sending up the 1980s.Some disappointments come from some of the characters and their relationship never really developing but this is a result of an author documenting what he sees around him rather than projecting himself into the characters.Certainly one of the more interesting teen movies to be made, real in an unpretentious way...""It is like if Crowe didn't write it as he saw it, it would be bogus and then the movie would be bogus too.""",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
119,renegadeviking-271-528568,Fast Times at Ridgemont High review,7,5 January 2021,"In a nutshell, Bored & Dangerous says: ""A modern classic in a genre that is so easy to dismiss because so much deserves dismissal.""""All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and I'm fine.""Teen movies generally have a pretty short shelf life. They're normally so of the moment and so concerned with what's cool then, that they date themselves while they're still playing in theatres. But there are a few great teen movies that still hold up decades later, and not just nostalgically for the people who saw it at the time, but for new generations as well. These teen movies live on because they tackle universal, timeless issues that effected teens then, now and forever. Movies like Fast Times at Ridgemont High.Following a school year in the life of half a dozen or so school kids, Fast Times covers all the obvious character bases. There's Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Linda (Phoebe Cates) the two hot girls obsessed with growing up as fast as they can. Brad (Judge Reinhold), the goofy older brother trying to figure out what life will mean from outside of high school next year. Mark (Brian Backer) and Mike (Robert Romanus), the two dweebs who want to be cooler than they are. Charles (Forest Whitaker) the jock, and Spicoli (Sean Penn) the stoner. Those descriptions are clichéd, I know. But part of the genius of this movie its ability to start with clichés, then flesh them all out in believable, real ways.There are over arching stories and most characters have some sort of goal, or thematic structure driving their story, but this isn't a standard three act story. It's a little more like real life, when people go from one thing to the next, and just try to figure it out as they go. No clear or tidy narrative, or neat conclusion to their stories. It's a series of life slices, picking up and putting down characters as their believable mundane lives have little spikes if action, incident and drama.Whenever Fast Times at Ridgemont High gets talked about today, there are two things that usually get mentioned. One is the fact that an adult Cameron Crowe went back to high school and posed as a teenager to research and write the book that this movie would be based on. The other is Sean Penn's portrayal of Jeff Spicoli. Both of these are pretty cool, but both are far from what makes this movie great. Amy Heckerling, in her first at bat as director, gives Fast Times so much life, that she deserves just as much credit as Crowe and his screenplay. And while Spicoli is a funny enough distraction, he's the most one dimensional and least interesting character in the movie. Yet the cover art and posters for this ensemble piece are always a big ol' photo of Spicoli.But none of that really matters, because whatever keeps people talking about this movie is a good thing, as it means more people will see it. Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a modern classic in a genre that is so easy to dismiss because so much of it deserves dismissal. But when done well, even something as usually disposable as a teen sex comedy can be great. Also, did I mention it's really, really, really funny?",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
120,patriciogl10,Fast Times that deliver!,9,17 September 2018,"This one's been on my watchlist for a while now and I finally got a chance to see it. It did not disappoint me.
Fast Times at Ridgemont High tells the story of a diverse group of young students, each and every one dealing with their own problems: girls, boys, sex, drugs, social status, the usual when it comes to this type of films.
Actually this was one of the first of its kind, it served as a stare to life in high school embedded in the context of the 80s. And every film that has followed mantained and further developed its essence.We come across several different characters, and we see them handle their own situations in a believable manner. The script is fabulous, the direction is correct. Both Cameron Crowe and Amy Heckerling were able to transform
their work into a coherent story that wonderfully encapsulates the ups and downs of life in high school. This movie doesn't try too hard, doesn't try to come off as ludicrous or too depressing. It adresses touchy subjects like
abortion with absolute care without any hint of pretentiousness.
It feels realistic.Sean Penn is memorable as Jeff Spicoli; arguably the best moments of the film are his exchanges with the strict History professor Mr. Hand. Judge Reinhold is great as the senior student Brad Hamilton; Jennifer Jason Leigh also provides a formidable performance as Brad's sister Stacy Hamilton. You somehow manage to care for these characters, which can be a product of an affirmation that many of us have been in their shoes at some point in our lives.Fast Times' status delivers. Anyone who appreciates 80s culture and teen life in high school should not miss this movie. It's a MUST!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

This is one of those films that manages to catch a glimpse of the real teens of the period, with a less male focus gaze and some iconic performances (with Sean Penn at the top) and soundtrack, but it doesn't hold up as well today as some of its contemporaries.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

The funniest part of the movie was when the arrogant history teacher got revenge on the main character by showing up in his bedroom and making him learn all the things he should have learned in class during the school year. This was one of Forrest Whitaker's first movies. After winning an Oscar, I know he wants to erase this movie from his memory. Overall, this movie had a bunch of hyperactive, stupid teenagers.

124,JoshtheGiant,Hilarious,8,25 February 2006,Fast Times at Ridgemont High is based on Cameron Crowes cult novel by the same name and he wrote the screenplay to the film. Cameron Crowe has written and directed some of the best romantic comedies of the last several centuries. He was the man behind Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous his two real masterpieces. He was also behind decent films such as Elizabethtown and Vanilla Sky. His screenplays are some of the best ever written and although Fast Times at Ridgemont High is not his best it is really good. The performances in Fast Times at Ridgemont High are great. Jennifer Jason Leigh is amazing as the fifteen year old girl who is suddenly interested in sex. Sean Penn though is the easy standout as the fifteen year old kid who has been stoned since third grade. Penn is just completely hilarious as the stoner who I would guess inspired Napolien Dynamite. So so funny.,Fast Times at Ridgemont High

It is filled with funny lines...lines that people are still quoting almost 25 years later.Yet there is also a heart to this movie that makes you care about these people...you want them to succeed.

Ronald Reagan in office, everyone was scared of the 'Reds'! Heck we were just out of the seventies practically, things were totally different dude. ""Faasst Times at Ridgemeont High..writing on the wall"" as Sammy Hagar, the red rocker belted out, in regard to a bunch of heinous teens, with hormonal issues. They thought they knew it all...it turns out they were just out of their heads!! Sean Penn from everything I heard about the making of this was actually living in 'Spicoli' he said. Who would have thought, crazy Sean would have been this good, back then!? Surfin' lazy, Van Halen wannabe rocker who just wants a cool brew and some good 'bud' to share with a bud. This group of misfits that rounded out this little comedic HIGH-school whip of a movie, were new, wet behind the ears, pimpled and well..into everything, and the perfect fit for Ridgemont High School. I have seen this many times from when the theater opened it back in 82'. Still, it has the same feel as it had then. It's like the stoner's movie about nothing and for the masses in the high school cast that's where most ended up. No worries though, everyone learned a little something about high school, recreational drugs, beer, lust and maybe if they were fortunate...'life'. The portrayal of the lives of these teenage growing 'pains' was along what I saw in school back then, since I entered high school a year later. It was a different time and way of life then. The eighties had it all! This movie has a fantastic line up of talent. Who could forget Ray Walston as the irreverent and ever-anal Mr. Hand, always irritated with Jeff's behavior, no matter how cool Jeff would be trying to play it off. Mr. Hand asks Jeff as he enters class after the tardy bell, Mr.HAND: ""Mr. Spicoli, why are you continually late to my class?"" SPICOLI: (thinks, puzzled) ""I DUNNO."" Mr. HAND: ""Well class I am going to write his words on the chalk board for all to see."" Mr.HAND:- ""Mr. Hand will I pass you class? (without hesitation) Gee Mr. Spicoli...I don't know?"" Spicoli: ""Huh huh huh, cool.""There is of course a ton more great comedic 'short-shots' in this one... The new digitally remastered DVD is especially good with bonus features to view. If you haven't seen this in a while it is a treat to behold. Ahh, the days of naive ignorance and a whole lot of fun!! Recommended for ex-high schoolers and current schoolers too. The Spirit bunny- cheer leaders had mondo spirit, so give me an 'F' give me an 'A' give me an 'S' give me a 'T' well, okay you get the rest, so go already and pick this classic up again and sit down plug in blast back to 19 hundred 82 two, light-up, drop-out and most of all enjoy the fast 'times'.

127,robsta23,It's a Fast Time Watching this Movie,8,27 May 2015,"Although I didn't LOVE the film, I honestly wanted more of it when it was over; Fast Times is a good coming of age movie with its own quirky tone that sets it aside from films like Dazed and Confused or American Graffiti.One main difference between this film and the others mentioned is that this film covers an entire school year while Dazed and Confused and American Graffiti deal with the events in a town over the course of one day. The time flies by in this film as the editing uses hard cuts to transition to scenes which occur weeks or months later.Comedy comes from all types of characters in this film, making it a great deal of fun. One of the funniest moments in the film is a famous one which I had no idea was a fantasy scene - Brad Hamilton imagines his sister's friend taking off her top and walking towards him. She catches him in the act, and it makes for a very awkward situation.Even the serious characters, like Mr. Hand, bring life to the story. His interactions with Sean Penn's character are like separate quirky battles between the two of them.I don't really get why Sean Penn is billed first in the credits - the main characters, at least in my eyes, are Stacy Hamilton and ""Rat."" However, I do have to admit parts with Sean Penn are some of the funniest in the movie, though Penn seems to overdo the stoner voice. The ending of the film was one of the best Sean Penn parts of the movie, which I will not reveal since it is a great moment which becomes a big payoff for a particular character.Overall, the film is funny, light-hearted, and while there are many elements to the movie it goes by in a flash, just like the title states; it truly is the perfect title for the film.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
128,faraaj-1,Badly dated,5,23 July 2006,Fast Times at Ridgemont High is considered a classic 80's comedy. The 80's were a pretty low decade for cinema as a whole and this is not a classic even by 80's standard. The only interesting thing is to see a very young Sean Penn as a drugged out high-school student. The entire movie is about getting laid and tries to show how high school was/is in the 80's. There is not even a semblance of a plot and the direction by Amy Heckeling is quite irritating.The cast also includes a very young Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe Cates - both of whom appear nude (a redeeming aspect to the movie...hehehe) and Judge Reinhold from the Beverly Hills Cop series.Better 80's comedies would include anything by Eddie Murphy or director John Hughes. This one is not worth wasting two hours over.,Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I mean Jeff Spicoli could have carried the movie by himself, he was extremely funny, and it is great to see how a ''stoner'' was seen in the 80's, not that other characters were bad, everybody did great.If you watch the movie closely, you can see from the emotions of self proclaimed sex experts Linda and Damone, that really they are not experienced at all, Damone's first time was with Stacy, and Linda never had a first time with the 40 year old boyfriend she kept talking about with Stacy.Jeff Spicoli's pizza delivery to the class was awesome :D, everyone who likes high school movies showing teen life should definitely watch this one, since it is a classic and in my opinion one of the best high school movies ever.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
130,huh_oh_i_c,Must be the only movie ever made that treats abortion the way it should!,8,10 April 2015,"I usually like Roger Ebert, but his review of this completely missed the ball with his square-stick-up-the-butt review. This movie is NOT scuzzy or salacious in any way shape or form. Let's consider that there are a grand total of three (3!) breast scenes, for a estimated 24 seconds, or perhaps it was 11? This movie has THREE Oscar winners in it: Withaker, Crowe and Penn, with even 2 Oscars.People who do find this movie ""dirty"" aren't the ones who got dates in high school nor college.I found this movie refreshing, since it treats abortion as a natural choice for a 15 year old girl, but most of all, the way they talk about it. See there the immediate positive effect of a woman directing. It isn't the usual whole belabored brouhaha it usual is in American movies, full of guilt, shame etc.: The teen father is a scumbag who first tries to shift blame, and slut shame Leigh, but quickly realizes that he has a responsibility. That's refreshing and rare in US movies. He tries to get the money, he fails, but what matters he sincerely tries. Kudos for not making him one dimensional.The brother is not judgmental, and he agrees to keep her secret, instead being overly protective, or making a big deal out of it. He's perfect! He asks if she's okay, which a brother should, and doesn't pry. The simple act of getting her food is a way of telling her that he will back her up, without the oppressive need of telling her explicitly so, which amount to self-aggrandizement in many cases.JJL, as an actress, is not exploited in any way whatsoever. She went on to have a solid career (exploited actresses usually don't) with a record 19 nude roles, last one at age 50. That breathes confidence in herself and doesn't say: ""Ooooh, I was so damaged by doing nudity at age 18"". (btw, neither was Shields, Thora Birch, Drew Barrymore etc.) FTARH was the beginning of Leighs career.Sure, the nude scenes might SEEM gratuitous, but believe you me, this is what goes on at high schools, also to this day. At age 14-15 girls are pretty materialistic: they want the guy with biggest car, highest pack status etc. Why do you think Dakota Fanning stopped homeschooling at that age? Don't expect good judgment from them as to what guy to sleep with. Besides, sleeping with a hot older boy, elevates her status enormously with her friends, that's true now as well, even in Utah. Blue state girls might not go all the way like red state girls, and they surely are less promiscuous (www.gutmacher.org), but even there, French kissing the football captain is a good thing.Cates' nude scene is regularly voted The Best Ever Nude Scene of All Time. BTW, Cates' advice to Leigh to dump the 26 year old is sound: don't mope around for some sales clerk. Usually, the girl would be victim. Stacy moves on, upbeat!The only highly unrealistic thing was the teacher. What teacher would allow Sean Penns behavior, AND go to his house for tutoring?? Never would happen.The Melancholic Alcoholic.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
131,PCT1970,"Fast Girls, Fast Cars, Fast Carrots?",8,5 May 2019,"Heckerling helms the quintessential coming of age teen movie of the 80's. It helped that Crowe, who went undercover in highschool at the time, penned the screenplay. This film has superlative direction, cinematography, screenplay, setting, costume, soundtrack and acting. All the artists involved deliver unequivocal portrayals of life during the 80's. In particular Penn, Leigh, Reinhold, Cates and Walston are superb. Penn created one of the most memorable characters, Jeff Spicoli, to ever appear on film. Spicoli became a lifestyle for many fans. This viewer owned his first pair of black and white checkered Vans soon after the film. The plot revolves around two precocious teenage girls named Stacy and Linda. Stacy takes advice from her supposedly experienced best friend Linda and soon finds herself in a love triangle with a nice guy and his not so nice guy best friend. While this is all going down Spicoli, who lives to surf and get high, unwittingly starts to do battle with the strict teacher every highschool in the 80's had, Mr. Hand. Mr. Hand despises Spicoli's lifestyle and antics but eventually comes to enjoy the company of the loveable and somewhat oblivious stoner. The plot is clever, funny, offbeat, heartfelt, insightful and has a hilarious ending. The film has flaws and is not perfect but it's exemplary depiction of teenage life in the 80's makes up for it. There are so many memorable scenes and famous quotes in this film. One of the most unforgettable scenes is Linda's exiting the pool and heading to the bathroom. It's quite uncomfortable for one of the characters. To this day you'll hear fans utter such lines as Spicoli's, ""All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and I'm fine"".

132,Meredith-7,Essential eighties teen sex comedy,7,29 July 1999,"One of the funniest things about FTARH is that there are so many critically respected actors in early roles all bundled in to the same film.  Sean Penn is by far the funniest as the stoned out surfie, you would almost swear that Keanu Reeves used the same character for the Bill & Ted films.  This film is also interesting as it was written by Cameron Crowe pre Singles and Jerry Maguire and directed by Amy heckerling pre Clueless.  So much talent went in to making this film, and as a teenage comedy about High Schools go it is certainly one of the best, if not the best that I have seen.  As it was the early eighties, the music, not to mention the fashions have to be seen to be believed.

It consists of relationships between several high school teens without much depth. I also find Sean Penn a little overacting.

Sure it is said to be a `cult classic' but that usually makes me even warier. I must admit I did enjoy this movie as it did convince me that it was an honest and quite true reflection of growing up as a teenager in the US in the early 80's. What did shock me though is how dated it looked. From the off it oozed late 70's/early 80's which I suppose added to its authenticity. There are some memorable scenes in this movie, notably involving trainee nympho Stacy (a very cute Jennifer Jason Leigh) desperate to be educated in the way of sex, plus Sean Penn's stoner surfer Spicoli character pitting his smoked out wits against his army major type history teacher. Plus theres poor old Judge Reinhold involved in the most embarrassing situation any male could be caught in (literally).

It's incredibly on the mark. But your mileage may vary, and I'll let the other reviews cover that. My purpose here is to reveal the horror which I just witnessed on a basic cable showing of Fast Times.This movie earned an initial 'X' rating from the MPAA when first submitted, and after a few cuts garnered an 'R' for its release. The movie I saw on basic cable this morning would barely rate PG. Massive cuts and edits were evident all through the film. Entire scenes were removed. The dialog was edited so that you'd think it was made in the 1950's. The hilarious masturbation scene was edited in such a way that it appeared Linda walked in on Brad while he was peeing. (They actually ran the film backwards during this scene.) Even some of the musical soundtrack had changed, due to rights issues I'd guess.My point is, if you've only seen this movie on basic cable, you really haven't seen this movie. The version I saw today was on A&E, and they just butchered it. Things like that should be illegal.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
136,imbluzclooby,Setting the foreground for teenagers of the 80's.,7,4 February 2007,"I was had just started my freshman year in high school when Fast Times came out. It was the beginning of the 80's when America was in a very strange transition that was affected heavily by pop culture. I believe. In lieu of all the teenager high school comedies ever made I would give Fast Times credit for starting it all, or at least breaking the mold for that genre. Very few movies of this kind were made and they usually didn't explore risqué and taboo themes quite as boldly. What thus followed in the 80's were exploitative romp films about teenagers getting into trouble. There are many to add to the list like ""Private School"", ""Last American Virgin"", ""Revenge of the Nerds"", every John Hughes film and more... Fast Times is definitely a cheesy film and knows it's target audience and shamelessly panders to it with all the sexual, drug and adolescent themes. Whether it served a purpose valuable purpose to kids or not is not its motive, but rather a means to drawing a young audience. The situations and the characters are interesting and from a thematic standpoint it uncovers teenage insecurity and awkwardness very well. And it's funny, both painfully and sardonically.

I know this is the 80's teen comedy by which all others are measured, but there's a great reason. IT'S GOOD! All of the actors were basically unknowns, and many of them ultimately became superstars and/or Oscar winners. The same can't be said for ""Just One of the Guys"", or ""Back to School"", right? But Billy Zapka should be in some sort of 80's Villain Hall-of-Fame from those flicks, if there was one.Anyway, along with the famous alumni, hats off to all of other actors from ""Fast Times"" who either fell off the acting radar (""Rat"", ""Damone"", ""Arnold"", ""Lisa"", & the cheerleaders (""Cindy"" & Springsteen's sister), as well as the dearly departed (off the top of my head, I can name Mr. Hand & Mr. & Mrs. Vargas).Finally, a special shout-out to April Audia, the Pat Benatar Wannabe.

141,jbartelone,"Not Much Plot, But I Am Always Compelled to Watch It",9,21 April 2008,"If you are looking for a great plot in Fast Times at Ridemount High, you will be disappointed because there is very little. It is more about the ""Fast Times"" (pun intended) of high schoolers who are interested in hanging out at the malls and having sex.But what makes the film work very well is the ensemble of very talented young actors who do amazing work with the weak storyline. The character stereotypes are very strong and well played. But it are the stand out performances of Sean Penn as stoned surfer-dude Jeff Spicoli and the absolutely BRILLIANT performance of Ray Walston as strict history teacher, Mr. Hand, that make this film unforgettable.Viewers are drawn to the performances of Jeff Spicoli and Mr. Hand so well, that incredibly, their scenes make the movie better than what otherwise would have been a typical teen, sex-obsessed exploitation flick.There are some great one-liners throughout the film that die-hards know by heart. Critics have discussed the superficial role of some of the other characters. However, an important point is that many high school students are often immature, superficial, and sex-obsessed. Perhaps not to the extent that this film shows. But if the film DIDN'T show the extreme attitudes of the students, you would have a fairly ordinary movie. ""Fast Times"" is positively reflected in fun times and the exciting escapades of high school kids. This movie shows that it can be fun without a major plot or seriousness attached to it, and not many movies can say that.The downside is that due to conflicts between the director and the scriptwriter, there will not be a full extended version of FTARH. The network TV print omits or dubs the bad language and removes all nudity. However, the TV version also has several scenes of added (and interesting) dialogs between the characters, that are not present in commercial home video versions, and probably never will be unless an agreement is reached between director Amy Heckerling and screenwriter Cameron Crowe, which is very unlikely.However, the performances of Sean Penn and Ray Walston push this film near the top.

Make sure not to miss a young Nick Cage, who is listed in the credits under his birth name, Nicolas Coppola (yes, he is related to that Coppola; he changed his name to avoid (justified?) charges of nepotism. He, of course, later won an Academy Award. So did Forrest Whittaker. Sean Penn won two.Let's talk about Penn's character for a bit. He is a stoned California surfer dude that serves as the main comedy for this film. Is he funny on his own right? Yes; yes he is. He steals every scene he is in and shows the sort of charisma that you just cannot fake. The scenes he shares with the strict history teacher, Mr. Hands, are the some of the funniest I've seen in any eighties film, and that is saying something.But it is far funnier considering that he is played by Mr. Dramatic Sean Penn. When I first watched this film, I had never seen him portray anything comedic or even close to it. And I have to say, it caught me off-guard. You wouldn't think a man who would be more fit for Shakespearean drama could make you laugh so hard at his dumb jokes. But it works. All hail Mr. Penn.This film, like a lot of Mr. Crowe's work, does not rely on the typical three-act structure to keep you interested. It just takes you along, like the waves that Sean Penn's character surfs, and takes you into these people's lives. The atmosphere is not as palpable and moving as it is in Almost Famous, but it's there nonetheless. You feel for all these people's lives and ambitions as you ride with them through the year. The characters feel dramatified, but in a way that increases their humanity instead of obscuring it. The situations feel real: I look at this film and think, ""Yeah; that's what it's like."" If I had to give this film a personal score, I'd probably give it full points. This is exactly what I want to see from a high school movie; and even more than that, I have developed a sort of personal connection with it. The first time I sat down for a viewing, I was a high school student myself, and I was spellbound. There is a certain authenticity that's lacking in many high school movies, even many good ones. For one of very few times in my life, I felt like I was watching a high school movie that was made by people who had actually been in high school. The tone hits the sweet spot between cool indifference and passionate shenanigans.For the life of me, I will never understand those who think this movie to be overly graphic. Yes, there is some sex in it. So be it. If there weren't sex, people would be missing the point of the film. It got an R; leave it alone. Now, why a film specifically and accurately showing the day-to-day activities of teens could not be seen by a lone teen is a different matter altogether. But nonetheless, the moral outrage this film caused is quaint and frankly weird. Remember, Animal House came out four years earlier. I'd love to time travel back to this film's release date and laugh at all the critics, including one man I greatly respect, the late Roger Ebert, who gave this film a one-star-rating in one of this most questionable decisions ever.But if this did break new ground, then applause to it. And I have to admit, I think it did, particularly for a film of this nature. Whereas most of its eighties contemporaries now seem old fashioned and slightly uncomfortable, this film still feels refreshing and relevant. I don't know whether that is more because this movie took more risks or because or society has not progressed as far as I would have liked, but it is worth noting nonetheless.And a result, the reactions are sort of flipped nowadays, at least from I've seen. The movies that were judged racy but acceptable at the date of release are now looked down upon by some, while movies like this have steadily been gaining their reputation as classics.As it just me, or should Crowe try television? The flow of his movies is more like a weekly series. I think he'd do well. It'd certainly be worth a shot after producing no great films in the last fifteen years. But likely, his lack of success has less to do with that and more to do with him not having personal experience, which seems to be a necessity for him. Those years at Rolling Stone made him director material. They also gave him an impressive library of music that he makes great use of in his films.I love Crowe. But he's not a perfect scriptwriter. And nor is Amy Heckerling, who actually directed this, a perfect director. And if I have to be brutally honest, some of the non-Penn performances feel a little stale. But this is definitely a movie with a lot to say and depict. If you want to know what was popular in the eighties, check out Ferris Bueller of BTTF. But if you want to experience the eighties, go watch this film.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
143,nixskits,"Cameron Crowe, accept your diploma!",10,4 December 2009,"If Alice Crowe really skipped her son not once, but twice (!) in school, I guess he had every right to go back after something less traumatic (traveling the world with rock stars) and get research material for what would turn into the great youth epic of the Ronnie Raygun era. The director Amy Heckerling and Crowe keep talking for another ten minutes after the end credits finish! All right, that's my kind of DVD!! Me thinks the high school experience is an integral part of his life, maybe more so than any other institution he has been a part of.Rolling Stone magazine ain't got nothing on Ridgemont, dude. The talent that had their first great roles in this flick are comparable to only ""The Godfather"" before and I don't know what since (fill in your favourite for this slot, such as ""Dazed and Confused""). Life in this town is about ultimatums. You either have a pool or not. You're either having sex or not. You've either annoyed Mr. Hand or not! What Judge, Jennifer, Sean, Phoebe, Forest and all the others learn at high school could fit in a thimble, if you're considering curriculum only. The true education is in cars, on the beach, at the burger joint, and yes, at that grand temple of the teenager, the mall. Sean Penn gives what has to rank as one of the twelve or thirteen most influential pieces of acting in the cinema. It's impossible to watch anyone play a ""dude"" and not summon up visions of Jeff, his gift to the world of comedy.Jennifer Leigh is heartbreaking as Stacy, the nubile little sister of Judge. Her character has a precious vase for a personality, one that can only become a glued back together item after the inevitable jerk she falls for shows her what the adult world is really about. Take note of this wolf in stereo salesman's clothing role, young ladies! That guy you think is Mr. Wonderful probably isn't!Phoebe probably caused more damage to videotapes and the tracking of the universe's VCRs than anyone else ever with the pool scene from paradise (and Judge probably made more kids throw up with laughter than anyone else, taking matters into hand). Yes, this film has something for almost all. It's a brilliant snapshot of schools before the last quarter century, with all the recent danger and insanity not in the way of teens just wanting a good time without risking a stray bullet in the process.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Just as *Lost Highway *paved the way for *Mulholland Drive *and as *Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels *did for *Snatch*, *Fast Times *did the same for *Dazed and Confused*, despite having different directors. They're both coming-of-age stoner comedies centered around a varying group of high school students, but mostly centered around a select few. The entire film is a slice of life and anecdotal, just showing things happening at Ridgemont High School and drama and relationships between characters. Overall, the greatest part of the film is my love/hate relationship with Damone and the lovability of our favorite surfer/stoner Spicoli. I wouldn't call it tremendous, but rather a fun movie. It's got an excellent cast that spearheaded the careers of many famous actors and it's an early example of a female-directed film, which is hard to come by. The most important part of *Fast Times at Ridgemont High *is how important it is as a predecessor for coming-of-age dramedies.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

The main theme of this film is how all the characters have different outlooks about life and how they go on about their personal lives. The acting, characters and direction were pretty good. All the characters were nicely written and none of them seemed out of place. Without the nudity, the film would have been perfect. Nonetheless it was an enjoyable film.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

147,BenTramerLives78,The essential teen sex comedy,8,24 October 2020,"Fast Times At Ridgemont High was first a book written by Cameron Crowe about his experiences undercover at a high school.I'm sure no one realized how much of a classic the film version would become. The cast is a who's who of up and coming future stars such as Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates, Judge Reinhold, Amanda Wyss, Eric Stoltz, Anthony Edwards and Nicolas Cage (billed as Coppola).
At the beginning of the film, we get a good look at the inside of a mall where all the teens work and hang out while ""We Got The Beat"" by The Go-Go's plays in the background. Many different types of teenagers are portrayed; we have the stoners (Penn, Stoltz, Edwards), the good girl wanting to go bad and (Leigh), the bad girl (Cates), the older brother who wants to be the big man on campus (Reinhold), and several others.This film is basically just about a bunch of kids trying to get lucky but there's some serious subject matter as well such as abortion. The acting and writing are superb and this will remain the ultimate classic in the teen genre and has yet to be outdone (sorry American Pie fans).",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
148,teejayniles2345,"Twenty years later, this ode to ""late"" Boomer culture shows its age",10,29 July 2001,"I'm a big fan of Cameron Crowe and somehow never saw this even though it's been available in video format since the 80's I'm sure.  The final shape of this film, however, does share some commonality with other work that Mr. Crowe may be given full credit for (ALMOST FAMOUS, SAY ANYTHING, among other cinematic successes).  It also, inadvertently, by its trendy capture of teen High School culture serves as a bit of evidence of the shallowness of Baby Boomers on the decline.  A lot is made of the colossal demographic importance of those born in the ""Boomer"" generation (the years 1945-1964 inclusive).  At this feature's filming in 1981, the supposedly seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds at Ridgemont High are ""rebels with an attitude."" However, with a little checking I found out that Sean Penn was 21 and Judge Reinhold 24 (the female leads were closer to high school-agers).  The madcap high jinks lead to many comic moments, only a few that are meanspirited.  I enjoyed the film, despite the format I happened across it:  a NBC Feature Film edited and fitted for the TV time period (July 28, 2001).  The network thought it was ""improving"" it by muddling some of the teens' profanities and descriptive terms.  Don't see this feature film in such a hacked-up form unless you have no other choice.  The commercials that NBC ran intermixed with FAST TIMES were its ""grandchildren"" in ironic ways.  For those who didn't see 1981 for themselves, FAST TIMES is terribly dated but simultaneously amazingly mild in its adolescent sex mania and rampant disregard for the bilge that is much of High School pedagogy.  Mr. Crowe must've seen basically the harmless part of California secondary schools. (Notice in a purely ethnic Los Angeles High School's cinematic story, STAND AND DELIVER, how Hispanic and Chicano students act and look different as the 80's went on). FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH as an ""ode to Boomer culture"" is OK as far as it goes.  It does put the ""sexual revolution"" and the ""devaluation of chastity"" under unflattering light as much of the entertainment business in the last 40-some years has done while thinking that it is doing young people such a ""great favor.""",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

They said the acting was poor, the plot sucked and they used every excuse in the book to show sexual situations. I was 9 at the time, and never saw the movie until my teen years sometime in the late '80s. I was like, ""Are Siskel and Ebert on drugs?"" First of all, the acting is great. Just look at the roster: Judge Reinhold, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates, Forrest Whitaker, Sean Penn, Ray Walston, the curly-haired teacher dude. All of whom had either established an acting legacy or were about to launch quite the acting pedigree. The plot sucked? It's HIGH SCHOOL!!! That IS the plot. A year in the life of teenagers. Every excuse in the book to show sexual situations? It's HIGH SCHOOL!!! High school is FOUR YEARS of sexual situations. Where did Siskel & Ebert go to high school? The ultimate litmus test to this movie's greatness is that, 24 years after it came out, we still have hardly a day go by without myself or someone else quoting a line from this movie. Spicoli: ""All I need are some tasty waves."" ""Make up your mind, dude, is he gonna s--t or is he gonna kill us?"" Brad: ""Mister, if you don't shut up I'm gonna kick one hundred percent of your a**!"" ""Doesn't anyone f***ing knock any more?""

153,jaywensley2004,We were all teen-agers once,9,11 December 2014,"Who am I? Who do I want to be? Are status, stature and popularity commodities accruable as assets to be leveraged for future happiness? Am I ""cool?"" Is there a future? Can I affect my future? These and a lifetime's other existential questions are symptoms of adolescence. And Cameron Crowe knew this when he went undercover, eventually emerging with the material which became ""Fast Times..."" the movie. His book is more ""timeless"" than the film, but Amy Heckerling's celluloid vision is a brilliant snapshot version of Cameron's anthropologic masterpiece. Like the contents of a time capsule, both formats depict an era's manifestation of a stage in our (human/people) cultural and societal development. For humans, adolescence is the advent of the recognition of personal power and its antithesis, society. In the civilization of North America the petri dish of this development is High School. It is in High School, as 14-19 year old humans that we discover a truth: Our parents and the ""adults"" in our lives have been proto-types, models, for the civilization (aka: SOCIETY) in which we will be expected to earn our place.Sex, drugs and rock n' roll, in their period's incarnations, have been the driving forces of adolescence since the advent of society (aka: Civilization). Sex? Ask your parents to be honest. Ask your grandparents to be honest...ask your Great-grandparents to be honest. If they are, they will admit that getting laid was a driving force of their adolescence. Drugs? Civilization's earliest records address alcohol/drunkeness. And organics (leaves, flowers, plants) are part of EVERY known culture's spiritual development/knowledge/wisdom. Every extant tribe has knowledge of consciousness altering substances and honors their VALUE. Rock and Roll? Music, poetry and the forms of their transmission are part of the historical record of every culture. Understanding of and appreciation of rhythm and melody are inherent, instinctive in humans (""Music soothes the savage beast"" anyone?). The history of people, especially the history of their values, is integral in the history of music.So, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (the movie) exists as a product of the vector of thousands of years of human history, human civilization. ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (henceforth ""FT"")"" is meant to be seen as a depiction of human adolescence intellectual and emotional developmental behavior vis. late 20th century culture.Oh, and the source material is generated by a man who was several years out of High School, with all the ""wisdom"" we believe life generates.All that said, my viewing in 2014 of the film made in 1982 assures me of the film's artlessness. ""FT"" sincerely depicts the behavior of adolescents of that period. We were responding to our environment, the attitudes, politics and expectations we were immersed in. Like adolescents of every era since civilization created society.For perspective, consider the ""Children's Crusade (1212 AD).""",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

It was fast; fast living. Fast Living at Bell End Boy's School where I attended. Those were happy days with all my friends; Neville, Bobert, Shawsy, Wee Scott, Bunter, Fitz, Simon, Murph, Stoat, Biggles, Rodger, as well as a few girls like Jem, Lee, Gree, Corky etc. My wee brother Andy was a couple of years below me so we didn't bother much with each other as that wouldn't have been cool. That chump Brendan tried to involve himself in our gang all the time but we all hated him more than Coldplay so we just beat him up and played tricks on him. After a particularly horrible toilet incident we would cleanse ourselves and then lob the cleansing utensils over into the cubicle he was sitting in. Ha ha, he would scream when they landed on his head or smeared his beloved physics homework.

159,crispy_comments,disturbing depiction of teens as numb & dumb,1,22 January 2007,"Reviewers who call this a great comedy, must be kidding. This is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. I can't tell if the filmmakers intended to make a social commentary on disaffected youth. But surely we're not meant to laugh at the sight of emotionally detached, morally empty teens? Oh, I'm aware that teenagers do stupid things, and I'm not appalled by the portrayal of drug use, sex, etc. These things happen. I *am* appalled by the notion that life-changing events such as losing one's virginity, getting pregnant, or having an abortion can be considered ""no big deal"". These characters don't think before they act, and they don't seem to *feel* anything afterward. This is what disturbs me about ""Fast Times"", and this is what I (thankfully) can't relate to.It's interesting that TV shows like ""Dawson's Creek"" were criticized for their supposedly unrealistic depiction of teens with large vocabularies, who made a ""big deal"" out of everything, and discussed their feelings. However, at least those kids *had* thoughts and feelings! As an intelligent, sensitive kid, so did I. Guess I didn't have the universal teen experience. But personally I'd rather read or watch a story about adolescents who overanalyze and feel deeply, than one where kids act like unthinking zombies. Shouldn't storytellers encourage growth and depth, rather than perpetuating a shallow way of life?Apparently Cameron Crowe went undercover in a high school and based his story on real events, which, frankly, scares me. Was this truly the '80s generation? Is this the current generation? And when making a film, is it enough to hold up a mirror to reflect society? Or shouldn't the filmmaker go a step further to comment on what he sees? Maybe even try to make the world a better place? True, many viewers are turned off by films that seem ""preachy"", but if writers/directors are skilled enough, I believe they can get a message across effectively. The best stories have a *point*, a lesson to be learned. I cannot figure out what ""Fast Times"" is trying to achieve.Other than to gross me out. For instance:A 15 year old girl loses her virginity to an older man she barely knows (who *must* be able to tell she's inexperienced and underage, but doesn't seem to care), outside, while staring at graffiti. Is this supposed to be a comment on how degrading and meaningless sex can be? On the fact that first times are rarely enjoyable, especially if you don't feel anything for the other person? A warning to choose your partner wisely? Perhaps, but it's certainly unpleasant to witness. And difficult to understand why she goes through with it. Stacy moves on to her next sexual partner like she's changing shoes, then casually asks the boy to pay for her abortion, as if she's asking him to buy her a soda. Is this meant to be *humourous* or is it just bad acting? The aftermath of the abortion is also treated like it's ""no big deal"", when in fact it would be a painful process, both emotionally and physically. Should I ignore that and simply praise the film for being brave enough to let a character go through with an abortion when movies/TV tend to push the pro-life agenda? I'm pro-choice, but I still find it unsettling that ""Fast Times"" seems to be sending the message that making this choice, and going through the actual physical ordeal, is as easy as pie.Is this movie condoning/glorifying casual sex, casual...everything? Or just...showing it...without taking a moral stance? If so, the filmmakers might be as emotionally detached and ethically bereft as the characters! I have to wonder whether they didn't make their message (if there is one) clear, out of a desire to appeal to the masses, to avoid possibly alienating their target audience with anything too ""preachy"". Could be no noble intent here, merely the use of controversial topics/scenes for shock value, and to get attention/make money.Was the ending a feel-good finale because the ""nice guy/geek"" gets the girl? The problem with that is, we never see her grow a brain or have an emotional epiphany about what/who she wants. Stacy just seems to let things happen to her. The conclusion feels as random, empty and pointless as the film in general.I want to praise Phoebe Cates though. She took what could've been a clichéd, one-dimensional role (sexually-experienced, bad-influence best friend) and gave it depth. You can sense that she figured out her character's motivations, and it comes through in her performance. I was most impressed by her scenes, and don't know why Jennifer Jason Leigh gets more critical acclaim - there's nothing going on behind her eyes, and such a blank void/""innocence""/childlike mental state, only makes her sex scenes seem more exploitative. Unfortunately the film treats Phoebe as a sex object too, with that gratuitous fantasy scene. Phoebe was insecure and sought reassurance about her acting, only to be treated like a bimbo-model. I can understand why she quit the movie business, with all the degrading trash she had to do. Shame she wasn't given more opportunities to prove that she really could act! The other actors made no impression. I didn't find Sean Penn's stoner dude act amusing as it's reputed to be.For the life of me I can't understand why ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" is hailed as hilarious or the ultimate teen movie. Ironically it evoked reactions in me that were lacking in the film itself, namely it made me THINK and FEEL (despair!) But if you want to laugh and feel good, I'd recommend these truly funny films:good-natured goofy fun: ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING (1987), CAN'T HARDLY WAIT (1998)clever, satirical, dark humour: HEATHERS (1989), THE CRAFT (1996), SAVED! (2004)great blend of realism & wish-fulfillment, relatable characters and psychological/sociological truth: THE BREAKFAST CLUB (1985), SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL (1987)",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
160,DrPhibes1964,Among the great films about the high school years,8,18 August 2021,"I didn't get the chance to see Fast Times at Ridgemont High unti it aired on a cable movie channel. It became an instant favourite, despite never having gone to high school myself (I dropped out in the 9th grade). This is a film that I can watch repeatedly and get the same amount of amusement. It is like revisiting old friends. Not long after seeing it I found the the source novel by Cameron Crowe. Apart from the elimation of a few minor characters the film is a very faithful adaptation, but embellished due to the actors cast in those respective roles. There is not a bad performance to be found, from the central characters to the minor ones. Director Amy Heckerling does a sensational job capturing the experiences of youth, both good and bad.We enter the world of Ridgemont High and introduced to our ensemble cast. There are no cliche bullies but each character is in the midst of their own little dramas, sometimes they overlap one another . Everyone is given there fair share of screen time, whether it be Stacy looking for a boyfriend, her brother Brad adrift after losing his girlfriend, Mark struggles with his shyness to ask a girl out, his friend Damone who scalps concert tickets to make extra cash, Stacy's friend Barbara who thinks she is more mature than actually is, and Jeff Spicoli who dreams of nothing greater than a ""tasty wave"". Adults are mostly absent from the film and the only prominent one is Mr. Hand the history teacher played by the great Ray Walston. He is the only thinking close to a ""villain"" in the story, but he's not and is actually very funny.I could go on in greater detail of the film but why spoil anyone's enjoyment if they are watching it for the first time. Even after forty years it still seems very freash. The dialogue is not of the 80's valley girl variety, which would have really dated the film and thankfully Amy Heckerling made these characters very relatable, even if you not in their world. We are voyeurs in their lives.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

162,Bevan - #4,"Look, Rashomon this isn't, but ...",7,10 January 2007,"... Fast Times is certainly the quintessential teen comedy of its day, though I stop a bit short of making the common generational mistake of proclaiming its virtues paramount over every teen comedy made since; no doubt the teen comedies of each generation speak to that generation and are largely lost on the others.What separates this from the others, IMHO, is its treatment of sexuality. The scene in which Jennifer Jason Leigh's character loses her virginity should be required viewing for teens, nudity or no, because teen sex can be *exactly* that awkward, abrupt and unfulfilling (and apparently JJL insisted on filming it exactly that way and exactly that explicitly for exactly those reasons); it's worth a hundred abstinence lectures from smarmy middle-aged moralists.It's a funny movie, but it's also an honest and a true one.7/10.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I present my case: with the arguable exception of Sean Penn, the screen time that director Cameron Crowe allocates to each actor is inversely proportional to their acting ability and appeal. Viewers are subjected to the hideous pair of Robert Romanus and Brian Backer for most of the film, while the marvelous Forest Whitaker gets about 20 seconds of screen time. A dreadful movie that is not funny enough to be a comedy nor serious enough to be a drama. Awful movie.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
164,jerome_horwitz,Why never a sequel?,8,7 June 2005,"Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a classic 80's teen flick. It feature's a great cast of characters, who most of us will find familiar with people we knew growing up.The story is pretty simple, it's a struggle about teen's growing up in a world of sex and desire compared to morality. What is desirable, and what does it take to be desirable? The story mainly revolves around, Stacy Hamilton, (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) a young woman's struggle with exactly where this line lays. Her journey takes some unexpected twist, although perhaps as a movie these twist are less expected.There's a variety of characters in this story: the stoner (played by Sean Penn), the cool guy with all the hookups, his somewhat dorky shadow of a friend, the older brother who makes no mistakes, and a few others. We get to know these characters from a distance, with the occasional glimpse into their personal beliefs.This is a classic teen movie, and most people not afraid of differences will like this film. Recommended for mature teens and the open minded, not for the kiddies.8/10",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

It's over 20 years old and has become one of those iconic teen movies and it's pretty easy to see why. It has everything you would expect; the bad hair, the bad clothes, the bad music, teenage awkwardness...all the clichés and stereotypes that we've seen repeated in basically every teen movie since then. And it has Sean Penn playing a stoner surfer. Sean. Penn. I'm pretty sure this movie is funnier now just because Sean Penn has had a successful career as a proper dramatic actor, and he plays the ultimate surfer dude perfectly. The grudge between himself and Mr Hand (Ray Walston) is great and probably produces the best (or at least funniest) moments of the film.All in all, Fast Times is fun. It might be because it's dated, cheesy, and clichéd, but it still does the job and it is entertaining.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
167,jeffman52001,A classic film of the 1980's.,10,28 December 2004,"""Fast Times At Ridgemont High""is an all time classic look at high school in the 1980's. The cast is awesome.The lives of the characters are really awesome, in school, we all have those times in our lives where we do a lot of crazy things in and out of school. The story starts out in the mall, seeing some of the kids who work there like Linda Barrett,played super by the beautiful Phoebe Cates (Gremlins 1 and 2, Private School, and Lace 1 and 2) and Linda's friend, Stacy Hamilton, played by another beauty, Jennifer Jason-Leigh (Single White Female, Deloris Claibourne, and Grandview U.S.A.) who is a girl who is easy,they both work at the pizza place in the mall. Across form the pizza place is where Mark Ratner a.k.a. ""Rat"", played by Brian Backer (Police Academy 4 and Meatballs)who has the hots for Stacy but is shy. Rat works at the movie theatre across from the pizza place. Mark Ratner gets some advice about how to get Stacy from his friend, Mike Damone, played by Robert Romanus (Bad Medicine, Fame, and Booker)who is a scalper, sells a lot of concert tickets. Mike Damone is the type who can get women easily.The other characters in this movie are great, Jeff Spicoli, played superbly by Sean Penn, he is the ultimate character in this film. Jeff Spicoli is a stoner who is into surfing. Spicoli has to deal with the history teacher, Mr. Hand, played by an awesome actor, Ray Walston (Johnny Dangerously, The Stand, and Picket Fences). Mr. Hand thinks that everyone of his students is on dope, he is so talkative about his ""Time"",,lol.Brad Hamilton, Stacy's brother, played super by Judge Reinhold (Beverly Hills Cop 1, 2, and 3, Gremlins, and Vice Versa). Brad has had 3 jobs in this movie, first job is at ""All American Burger"", gets fired for telling a customer off, A seafood restaurant, and his final job and a convenient store. Brad's senior year at Ridgemont has be somewhat good and bad, his girl friend,Lisa,played by Amanda Wyss(Better Off Dead,A Nightmare on Elm Street)breaks up with him.Charles Jefferson, played by Forest Whitaker (Good Morning Vietnam, Platoon, and Species)is a football player who owns a 1970's Firebird,which gets wrecked by Jeff Spicoli, who was driving it with Jefferson's younger brother, played by Stanley Davis Jr., on their way to a party. Spicoli has the car towed in front of the school and writes ""Lincoln Rules"" and other stuff, making it look like the rival high school,Lincoln's football team trashed it. Charles Jefferson pounds the crap out of Lincoln's team in the football game.Mike Damone makes a move on Stacy, and they have sex.Later on,Rat finds out and is mad and Mike for doing that, they nearly get into a fight. Stacy is pregnant and goes to get an abortion. Jeff Spicoli gets a visit from Mr. Hand and quizzes him on some history, they both get to like each other. The dance at the school went good, Mike Damone and Mark Ratner make up and are friends again. Brad is at work at the Mi-T-Mart, Jeff Spicoli is there getting a few things and has to go to the bathroom, a robber comes in and tries to hold up the place, but Jeff Spicoli distracts the robber and gets hot coffee thrown in his face, things work out for the better for everyone.The movie really has some many funny moments in it, the cast is really super. One of the great films that came out in 1982.The supporting cast also in the film are Scott Thomson (Police Academy 1, 3, and 4, and Ghoulies) as Brad's friend, Arnold. The late Vincent Schiavelli (Ghost, Night Shift, and Better Off Dead) as the biology teacher, Mr. Vargas. Zoe Kelli Simon, who's stage name is Kelli Maroney (Night Of The Comet and Chopping Mall), plays a cheerleader. The late Lana Clarkson(Amazon Women On The Moon,and Scarface)plays Mrs. Vargas.You will also see a younger Nicolas Cage (Valley Girl, Con Air, and Face Off)as Brad's other friend. A younger Anthony Edwards (Revenge Of The Nerds 1 and 2,ER,and Gotcha) as Jeff Spicoli's friend. Eric Stoltz (Mask, Pulp Fiction, and Some Kind Of Wonderful) as Jeff Spicoli's other friend. James Russo(Beverly Hills Cop, The Postman, and Extremities) as the robber of the convenient store.The soundtrack to this movie is awesome. Songs like ""Speeding"" by The Go Go's, ""Somebody's Baby"" by Jackson Browne, ""Love Rules"" by Don Henley. ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" by Sammy Hagar. ""I Don't Know"" by Jimmy Buffett. ""Goodbye, Goodbye"" by Oingo Boingo, ""Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)"" by Billy Squier, ""Raised On The Radio"" by The Ravyns.

Yes it was one of the first teen comedies, yes it's one of the best,and also the best written. The characters act like real teenagers. The situations for the most part and the way they deal with them are realistic, and because of that, this movie sets a standard not often reached. The main reason to watch this film however is that it's funny as hell, and in a good comedy that all that really matters.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
169,Shinwa,Uneven but entertaining,3,27 November 1998,"This movies tries to juggle a lot of plots, a lot of characters, and a lot of changes in tone, so it's easy to look the other way when one or more of the above hits the ground. Jennifer Jason Leigh looks impossibly young as Stacy, out to bolster her sexual experience; she's completely believable, and her performance is the real reason the watch the movie. Not that a cast that's probably ideal for any Six Degrees came isn't worth checking out; it's just really not as funny as its reputation suggests.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

171,davidholmesfr,Of the genre - could be worse,6,18 July 2010,"I'm not a fan of the teenage/high school genre, which seems to be a uniquely American thing. Thus I approached this with some trepidation and whilst my worst fears were not confirmed I remain unconvinced about the genre.There is little by way of plot; just a few months in the lives of the characters who range across the usual types to be found in this type of film. As with teen movies the focus is firmly on the males - they are the only ones allowed any variation of character. The girls always seem to be the same one-dimensional cardboard cutouts whilst the males are allowed to range from crazy to lazy and nerdish to pervish. In particular, the scenes immediately before and after a visit to the abortion clinic suggest that undergoing such a process leaves no physical or mental scars and is about on a par with a visit to the dentist for a check-up. Thus it's fair to say that the film is sexist - surprising given that it's directed by a woman.On the upside there are some good lines - particularly the comment about romance in Ridgemont: ""In Ridgemont? It's not even easy to get cable TV in Ridgemont"" (or something like that). And Sean Penn makes the whole thing tolerable.Is age and generation something to do with appreciating this type of film? I am a great fan of ""American Graffiti"" - it's more or less my generation. And why did I find myself rooting for Mr Hand in his battle with Scipoli?! I tend to follow Roger Ebert's and James Berardinelli's reviews and it's interesting to compare them on this film as they usually tend to have similar reactions. Berardinelli was fine with it seeing it as a reflection of his own generation, whilst Ebert hated it. And, of course, Ebert is from a much earlier generation.If you have 90 minutes and time is hanging heavy then you could do worse (unless, I suspect, you are an American at high school in the eighties in which case you'll probably appreciate it much more).Pass the zimmer frame, nurse.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
172,jzathajenious,"screw american pie, this is the pinnacle of teen comedies",9,29 November 2003,"*SPOILERS*i love this movie. it has an honesty and an awkwardness that rings true with many people when remembering their teenage years. it doesnt resort to gross out moments like american pie, and it doesnt have the unrealisticness of movies like dazed and confused. the only over the top role is spiccoli, but the movie needs a characeter like spiccoli to balance out the more serious characters like brad and demone. spiccoli rules!!! so does mr hand, played to perfection by ray walston. there are so many awesome characters in this movie, i truly love them all...brad is cool, he reminds me of me when i used to work at a fast food place, unlike me though, he doesnt put up with shit from the customers. also i used to have a major crush on my sisters best friend, so we have that in common as well. spiccoli is cool, he needs no explanation. i recommend you watch the dvd, it tells the huge effort penn went into to get into the spiccoli character, the dvd is awesome BTW, it has one of the best audio commentarries ive heard with director amy heckerling and writer cameron crowe...many cool insights into the movie!rat and demone are cool as well, although demone always seemed to old looking for me. when rat chickened out when he and stacey were getting it on, i wanted to scream at the tv, ""dude! you've done all the hard work, what the hell are you doing?!"" stacey was a hottie as well, JJ leigh did a great job, but the supreme hottie award goes toooo......PHOEBE CATES!

173,ghasl1,Not as Good as Expected It To Be,4,13 January 2012,"The only good thing in this movie was Forest Whitaker, its funny because its a total surprise seeing him at an earlier age and when he wasn't that famous up until now. For me he was the highlight of the show but he was only a sub character. The rest of the other characters where boring even Sean Pean, sounded more of a lame version with a 'gnarly' accent.I expected it to be storywise, comedy or romance etc there's no story in this movie other than highschool and sex with underage girls that chase older men so that they get pregnant and go for abortion its like the movie Juno. Problem with this movie it tries to come up serious and funny at the same time but doesn't click well, in the end it feels awkward.I've seen lots of teen flicks that are just as good, funny and with chemistry and teens getting into mischief. I recommend The Breakfast Club or Patrick Swayze movies. If you think this will be like Porky's, Screwballs, Bill & Ted, Revenge of the Nerds or Weird Science its not even close.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
174,ShadySovereign,They've got the beat!,10,23 January 2006,"""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is a very special film to me. It's the first high school movie that actually portrayed what REALLY went on inside the schools of the 1980's. What is seen in the movie is not only true and slightly disturbing, but also really funny in ironic ways.The movie shows the interactions of a bunch of high school students, all of which are unforgettable. I was especially very fond of Jennifer Jason Leigh, since she gave a very realistic performance as a 15-year-old high school student who finally gets laid at the beginning of the movie (but later decides that she wanted a real relationship instead of just sex). Sean Penn's performance was arguably the least realistic, but he was hilarious as the doped-out high school dude. And Judge Reinhold (who later on co-starred in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" films) was funny and likable as Jennifer Jason Leigh's older brother.There are many great 80's songs featured in the soundtrack. The very first song, called ""We Got the Beat"", jump-starts the beginning of the film with a blast. Then later on we hear the song ""Somebody's Baby"" twice, when Jennifer's character has sex two times with different men. Although the song is a happy song, it can make the sex scenes awkward since Jennifer looked very young for her age. I always had to look away from the screen whenever Jennifer was naked, because she looked too cute! It was disturbing to see at first, but I got over it.The only bad thing about the movie is that it's very short. But it can also be a good thing, since a shorter film means that people can watch it more times in a row. When I first got the DVD, I watched the movie 3 times in one day! It's one of the only movies that I can actually watch many times in a row.Overall, this was a great high-school movie with lots of laughs and memorable moments. And despite the fact that some may get offended by the nudity and the short film duration, the movie will still remain as a cult classic in my book.I give this film a 10/10.P.S: Look out for early roles & cameos by Forest Whitaker and Nicholas Cage in this movie!)",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
175,Tolbert,Good 80's film but could have done without a few things,4,13 November 2002,"First of all I'd like to start by saying that I think Amy Heckerling is an awesome Director. I loved National Lampoons European Vacation.This movie was pretty great for a few reasons but was disappointing for other reasons. The chemistry between Spicoli (Sean Penn) and Mr. Hand (Ray Walston) was right on. The irresponsible stoner kid who doesn't give a rat's tail about being to class on time and the teacher who frowns on truancy. The two of them are very talented actors who worked well together and their scenes together were funny. In terms of the fashion statements and the party-all-the-time attitude, this movie captured the 80's very well. However (spoiler alert) there were a few disturbing things about this movie. For one thing when Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) tells Mike (Robert Romanus) that she is pregnant, the reaction ruined the movie for me in an instant. He agrees to pay for half of the abortion and give her a ride to the clinic? Boy what a sweetheart! I think this is quite the sexist shot at men. Also, I think it would have been more poetic if her brother or even Spicoli kicked his butt just for good measure. Oh well! You can't win em all!All and all I give this one 6 out of 10 just for the scenes with Sean Penn. He deserved most of the credit for this movie. He made the movie for me. From start to finish, European Vacation was a lot better.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
176,Jacobi1,Painfully Bad!,2,13 March 2007,"Fast Times At Ridgemont High *Fast Times At Ridgemont High is considered a cult classic and a comedy. Where is the comedy? No, I'm serious, where is the comedy? The movie is more of a drama then a comedy. Plus this movie is really stupid and it is sometimes very hard to comprehend. At first I though it was me and watched the movie a second time and realized, no, it's not me, it's this movie.Judge Reinhold plays Brad Hamilton. He maybe the most awkward teenage character in a teenage movie. He works at a fast food restaurant but when he is hackled by a customer and decides to defend himself, he gets fired. As a result, he works at another food place witch is just as awkward and just as humiliating. Then he works at a store which he eventually becomes manager of. Maybe that is a good thing.Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Reinholds younger sister, Stacy Hamilton. She is the most saddest character in this movie and ever in a teenage movie. She has low self-esteem and she's easy. She lets Mike Damone, played by Robert Romanus, have his way with her and then gets pregnant, or at least thats what I got from it. She tricks her brother to drive her to meet her friends but as he drives away, she heads for the abortion clinic which Brad sees in his rear view mirror.Phoebe Cates plays Linda Barrett, Stacy's best friend, and the main subject of Brad's sexual fantasy. There is a scene where Linda teaches Stacy how to preform oral sex on a carrot. I got the impression that Linda is a bit of a whore. However she is in the only scene in the film that is worth watching. Brad fantasies about her where she takes off her top and kisses him. But other than that, the movie is dead in the water.Sean Penn plays the famous Jeff Spicoli. He is a very interesting character but is wasted in this movie. He has a bit of a confusing relationship with his history teacher Mr. Hand plays be Ray Walston. The relationship between the two is very shaky where it ends with Mr. Hand showing up at Jeff's house and forces him to review everything he was tough in this class. When the scene was over, I though what was the point of that.According to Fast Times At Ridgemont High, life is already a Cozmo soap opera at the age of 18. This reminded me of a similar movie entitled Crossroads with Britney Spears. Both films are not similar but they have the same message. Life is hard but it won't be like Fast Times At Ridgemont High or Crossroads. Fast Times At Ridgemont High is painfully bad and reprehensible.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
177,thebrighteyes,Don't expect anything very interesting about Fast Times,3,20 September 2007,"Fast Times At Ridgemont High doesn't have very much going for it except a handful of really good actors when they were only somewhat good actors.The movie centers around various high school stereotypes of the early-1980s, the innocent girl, and the sexually experienced girl; the nerdy, but smart guys; the cool guys that help out the nerdy guys; and, of course, the stoner/burn out. The problem with all these characters is that they fail to become anything more than stereotypes, although, the writer & director obviously tried very hard to make them so.The movie would have really worked a lot better as more of a drama with comedic elements, but instead tries to be a teen comedy with a couple of dramatic elements thrown in.It's sad really, that these characters all seem like they could have a lot of depth if only the director and writer tried to explore them a little bit more. For example, there is the whole ""guy getting his best friends girlfriend pregnant"" subplot that is resolved very half-heartedly and without much thought.There are a few funny moments, however, such as when one of the characters is on a date and realizes that he has forgotten his wallet at home, and he ends up biding his time until his friend is able to drop it off by continuously ordering Cokes. Unfortunately, these scenes end up getting lost in the fog of such a disorganized plot.Forget this movie, and go see The Breakfast Club instead.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I wasn't born in 1982. I'll be honest, I graduated high school not too long ago, yet there was something so familiar in this movie that I wanted to run away from it. If you're a teenager or a young adult, you'll probably have seen extremely dumb movies such as ""American pie"". You'll probably also have watched series made for teenagers in order to preach to them about ""serious matters"" like pregnancy. After watching this, I realized that it was the first movie of these two categories. I wasn't born in 1982, and what was in this movie doesn't seem outrageous or innovative to me, but I'm aware that it was at the time and that it created a genre. This is why I'm calling this movie historical.This movie is like many series and movies of the 80's and 90's that I've seen. A very silly and stupid cover hiding something that brings up ""deep"" topics. In that way, it's not a honest movie. It's so dishonest that it can lead us to believe that it's an exploitation movie. I'm still not sure if it is or not at this point. There was nothing funny about it in my opinion. I disliked American Pie, but I thought it was much funnier than this. The only reason I think a young person today would want to watch this is the nudity.I don't know how life in the 80's was and I'll never know. But I know what life in the 90's and the 2000's is, and I can tell you that many TV series aimed at teenagers used the same formula that's easy to notice in ""Fast times..""",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
182,yearspew,Masterful Comedy.,9,24 June 2008,"Fast Times At Ridgemont High is a very well-written comedy that goes way beyond Phoebe Cates's topless scene or Sean Penn's Spicoli. Not only it's a classic 80's movie that has influenced many other movies, it's a well-structured, inventive film with great quality to it.The film has four story lines: of Stacy Hamilton, of Brad Hamilton, of Jeff Spicoli, and of Damone and Mark Ratner.The story lines vary in tone, yet they maintain that harmony that allows the characters jump from one storyline to another and fit perfectly.The characters are memorable, quotable and very well played. Spicoli is perhaps the most memorable character in the movie, the stoner, surfer dude played brilliantly by Sean Penn. Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) is the guy who wants to succeed yet finds himself stuck in the same jobs, Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the girl that wants to grow up too soon, Damone (Robert Romanus) is a weasel, but a funny one, and Ratner (Brian Backer) is an innocent geek.

Not that it's a bad movie, it's just bland, particularly compared to the others I've seen--American Graffiti, Dazed & Confused, Sixteen Candles, American Pie, Clueless (by the same director as this film), and a few others.  The themes covered in this movie are just like the other ones, the main one being the discovery of ""true love"" as more important and more worthwhile than sex.  The characters seemed pretty uninteresting compared to the hilarious caricatures populating ""The Breakfast Club"" or the more emotionally complex characters from ""Dazed & Confused"" and ""Clueless.""  For me, Sean Penn and Judge Reinhold were the only really hilarious people in the film, and I never really got emotionally attached to anyone.The only thing I really valued about the film was the fact that a bunch of famous 80's actors are in it, and it's an interesting look at the culture of the time period.  Other than that, it was pretty boring for me.

Brian Backer would be the ugliest guy in this movie except that he manages to appear with Richard Romanus, who looks like Barry Manilow and Desi Arnez had a child. I honestly can't stand to look at him. This movie is slow and shallow, and when it does set up a joke it takes forever and then pulls it off with all the energy and excitement of a Saltine cracker.

It gives me a sense of nostalgia, even though I wasn't born until the 1990s, so I don't quite know why, perhaps its nostalgia for a better era of 'coming of age' films or perhaps it's not nostalgia at all but rather a feeling that I can't explain.I've heard some people say it's not acted well. Well, it may not be the highest calibre but that doesn't take very much away from the unique plot of so many stories running into one another. You learn to feel for the characters, sympathise with some while laughing at others (anyone who has watched this will know which characters I'm referring to here). No, it isn't a dramatic masterpiece, but it's not lazy. It's easy watching and is a great underrated ambassador for an interesting decade.P.S. I had no idea that this is where 'Staceys Mom' comes from. Another aspect that links back to my nostalgic youth.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
189,cbrown-3,Great Movie,10,30 July 2001,This is a classic movie The Bright spot was Sean Penn's Character Jeff Spakoli He was great in this film. Especially when he orders the pizza in the class room. Brad was another great character being played by the Judge. His great spot was at the end when the guy was robbing the store. They could have gone with out the part when he is in the bathroom that was disgusting. Overall i give 10 out of 10 stars. I HIGHLY recommend it.,Fast Times at Ridgemont High

191,Chris(Runner),This is a great movie,10,31 July 2000,"This is a great high school movie. I haven't seen a lot of the other ones, like ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""The Breakfast Club,"" but I have seen this one, and it is doesn't look like it could be matched. It shows just about every class of people in high school in each person. There are the druggies who don't care (Spicoli[Sean Penn]), and the people who are just trying to look for a break in life (B. Hamilton[Judge Reinhold]). There are also some others that are depicted, like all the football superstars (Jefferson[Forrest Whitaker]). Then, it's cool, if you think about it, there is like a male duo that has a female counterpart. You probably don't understand what I'm saying. I'm talking about Mike Damone and Mark Ratner (Robert Romanus and Brian Backer). Mark is looking for a date and has to turn to Mike for help. Mike tries to act cool like he's the expert. Then you have Stacy and Linda in the same position (Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe Cates). Stacy has to go to Linda for help. It's just cool how they set it up. Anyway, This movie depicts all classes of high school life, and many aspects of it as well. I have seen a situation much like the one where spicoli walks in late and says the line was too long at the vending machine. ""I just couldn't make it on time."" This is  movie, unlike a lot of the other strictly-for-laughs comedies, that you would want to sit down with a friend, eat doritos, and enjoy. I just wanted to say that this is a great high school movie. So, if you're in high school and haven't seen it, see it.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

195,silverpinkcity,One of the Best Teen Comedies Ever!,9,1 September 2021,"I know, it's crazy in 2021 to write a review about a 1982 movie. But...I just watched this movie (again!) yesterday and thought...why not?This is one comedy that you can watch over and over and still find just as funny as the first time you watched it. The humor just...works. Actually, the blend of drama and comedy is what works.This film isn't slapstick silly or totally full of angst and seriousness. It's like real life...a blend of both; humor and heartache...handling issues such as teen pregnancy, first time sex, etc... That's why this movie works. Why can't we have more comedies like this nowadays? The closest teen comedy (recently) I can come up with, is Edge of Seventeen.The acting in this movie about a bunch of teens in the early eighties (focused around the mall, high school, fast food restaurants, and Stacey's backyard pool) is spot on. There's a realism to the characters, cliche though they are, that totally sucks you in. And of course Sean Penn and his rival, the sarcastic Mr. Hand, is hysterical.We have the nerd and the football star and the sweet ""virgin"" Stacey and the druggie and the sexy experienced girl...and oh yes. The Pat Benetar look-alike. We also have Judge Reinhold as Stacey's older brother who is having a hard time with his fast-food career.However, the one character who really sticks out in my mind...the one character who does NOT get mentioned NEARLY enough, is Demone...the ticket scalper ""cool guy."" I always loved this character, and the way Robert Romanus plays him is incredible.Yes, there's nudity in this film, but it fits. Okay, maybe it's a bit gratuitous, but you know. It's the early eighties. Simply put, I love this movie, dated though it is...although one could even argue that adds to its charm.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

It is a cult classic and it was great to remember the classic scenes, hair/clothes of the era, young love and memorable phrases in this movie; he should have foreseen that. Again, I disagree with Mr. Ebert in that it has more than a few exceptional actors (who went onto notable careers). It was never meant to be complicated and there is no drama (an Ebert requirement for a high rating).....no one dies. No offence to Mr. Ebert, usually he's dead on, just simply enjoy it for what it is; fun!My definition of a good movie is whether you'd watch it a second time; I'm on number 4 with this one.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I was in my early twenties at the time so I could ""understand"" the things in this film (basically stereotypes). I didn't like the film then and the only reason I would suggest that anyone see it now is for '80's nostalgia. I always thought that this was an empty film pretending to be funny, which it isn't, and trying to have some kind of message. It's nothing but a cheap, trashy, BAD bad taste (as opposed to good bad taste, which I like) teen exploitation movie masquerading as something special. From it's reputation, one would think this is some work of brilliance. The characters were shallow and dull and I could never figure out how people love the ridiculous stoned out surfer character so much.Now...if this film had not taken itself seriously or, perhaps, been written as a put on or satire of high school or even teen movies and teen pop culture in general, circa 1982, such as the brilliant ""Lord Love a Duck"" did back in 1966, it very likely would have been something much better or even truly great.In my opinion, if you want to see something teen oriented which is far superior, see ""Heathers"" or definitely ""Rock'n'Roll High School"" or even ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Early stop for future stars Forest Whitaker and Nicolas Cage. The edited television version makes no sense removing key scenes and replacing them with cutting room floor footage.

A very famous one for that matter. With a script written by Cameron Crowe we get to follow a few teenagers in high school and it's sometimes funny, sometimes, embarrassing and sometimes downright stupid.

The best thing about it is that it put Cameron Crow on the map. Of course, some people will relate to some of the characters and circumstances, but the movie falls far short of capturing what it was truly like to be in high school during this era.

210,tonynogueira,Not a teen comedy,3,22 March 2020,"So I missed this big hit back in the 80's, finally saw it almost 40 years later, and waited for the comedy to come, but it never really did. It had great 80's music, a bunch of at the time new famous actors who went on to many great things. I always thought this was a teen sex comedy type movie along the line of Private School, Party Animal or Hardbodies and other similar type, however unfortunately Fast Time never came close to those type of movies. Comedy practically not existent, nudity was in comparison to others was minor. It wasn't a bad movie overall, it was just more drama with a light side. It was also odd that was basically underage girls having sex, Phoebe saying she had sex at 13 years old, and now 15 and in sexual relationship with older guy, Aly is 15 and has a1 night stand with a 26 year old, then the 2nd time has sex gets pregnant. Then going for an abortion at 15?! However I think the ""it"" factor of this movie that made it classic was Phoebe Cates swimsuit slow motion walk out and showing boobs. She was 18, never did nudity again, and that scene is the iconic scene that every guy knows about, I never saw the movie until now, but had seen that scene or pictures of that for many years. It is a movie for an 80's kid appreciate for nostalgia reasons or maybe saw it back then which at the time might of given me a different perspective, unfortunately at this point didn't do much for me, however glad I saw it finally.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

212,dckennedy,"Teen cult film classic: Learn it, know it, watch it",8,20 April 2006,"This film has been called one of the better of a disreputable genre, which is exactly right. No one (at least no healthy male :) should miss Phoebe Cates and Jennifer Jason Leigh's famous nude scenes, or Sean Penn's unforgettable performance as stoner Spicoli, with his classic one-line summary of Thomas Jefferson. Cameron Crowe made up the characters based on real teens from his year as an undercover high school senior. His script shows a rare ear for teen dialog and absurd situations. The film launched Sean Penn's long (some would say too long) and Phoebe Cates' short (some would say too short) careers.Fast Times is an early classic of the film genre best represented by the John Hughes flicks of the late 80s (Molly Ringwald, Ferris Bueller). Unlike the gross-out Porky's or later slick ripoffs like Scream and American Pie, this movie is both funny and bittersweet. The whole teen-twenties category captured the late Boomers/Gen-X-er's struggling into adulthood without adult guidance, which is the subtext of Crowe's ""fast times"" - kids growing up too fast. Neither Crowe nor director Amy Heckerling offer explicit morals here, but the standard question of postwar American life - where *are* your parents? - floats in the background. As in Almost Famous, Crowe delivers devastating judgments without being the least preachy. Fast Times was released in 1982, at just the moment when American culture was leaving behind the decadent 70s and the Boomers were starting to have their own kids. Definitely a funny-sad snapshot of a bygone time.http://home.earthlink.net/~donzig/Ferris_Saves/",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Sex and nudity. Unfortunately kids of the era probably saw this movie as cool and the way the way to be. But the message of this film is that teenagers are dumb and are only interested in sex and drugs, and if they are not then they should be. Forget aspirations, intelligence, feelings, thoughts, emotions and love. Only think about how soon you can lose your virginity, who you can bed, how you can bed them, how long you can go with them, how you're going to discard them in order to move onto your next sexual conquest and how much stoned off your face you can get, and how much you can brag to your friends about it all. Even the couple depicted in a stable relationship are completeley devoid of emotion as they want to break up just because high school is coming to an end and they want the opportunities to screw around with a new bunch of people, so it seems they had 0 feelings toward each other and were only together for the easy sex. Shallow and unlikeable characters in a shallow and unlikeable movie.And abortion? That issue is tackled in the most unrealistic and misleading way. Like getting a cup of coffee. How many girls has the film screwed up for life because of this.Parents are nowhere to be seen, as if they didn't even exist. This actually explains the teen's hopeless behaviour. If SoCal teens were really like this in the 80s, it's a very poor reflection on their parents and upbringing and American society in general.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

I was 22 years old when it was made, so I may be a little biased (having graduated HS only four years prior). I have seen it several times and it is definitely better than most of today's high school movies.Like any high school movie there were a few scenes that were far fetched and others that were more realistic.The performances were very good and in a few cases off the charts. Sean Penn, Phoebe Cates and Judge Reinhold were excellent. The younger actors were great, but the older performers like Ray Walston as a teacher were excellent, too. Even though it is funny, about a third of the movie is drama and those moments are well acted, too. They involve some serious decisions that have to be made by some of the characters.Another reason to view the film is the music soundtrack. It is excellent. It is quality rock music.

225,ThorBloodEagle,There is no way to summarize this movie,4,20 May 2005,"This movie was a huge disappointment to me. I had heard great things and was expecting to see an amazing movie, how wrong I was. The movie had no plot, no conflict and no character development. Some people have said that even though there was not plot, it was still a good movie as it encompassed life in the 80's perfectly. I disagree. The lack of plot was a poor choice by the director and writer. It made the movie less enjoyable and much less believable. Without a conflict, there is nothing to keep you hooked on the movie and want to finish watching it, except the hope that it can only get better (which it never does). When there was a conflict, it was solved within the next couple minutes in a very non-satisfactory way. For example: ""I'm pregnant"" ""What should we do about it"" ""I'm getting an abortion. you pay for half and give me a ride"" ""ok."" And thats all that happened with that. It was ridiculous. The lack of character development was also terrible. Not once did I ever feel attached to one of the characters. There were so many little sub plots that there was no attention drawn to one character or set of characters. You did not ever really get to know any one of the characters.The movie felt like it was trying to copy ""National Lampoon's Animal House"", but it did a horrible job of it. Sean Penn's character Jeff Spicoli seemed to be an attempt at John Belushi's famous ""Bluto"". However, it didn't work. I cannot even begin to explain to you how bad this movie was in any sensical way. All in all, it is a movie that you probably should see in your life as it is, for some reason, a classic. HOwever, do not expect much (if anything) from the movie or you will be highly disappointed as i was. The only reason i rated it 4/10 is because there is an old Volkswagon Van (better known as the Hippie Van) and I want one. Without the Hippie Van, the movie gets a 2.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Great that it was based off of Cameron Crowe's book, which Fast Times, obviously was a BIG push for him. The characters were all likable and I could still relate to so many of the things that happened on screen, hit home - even almost twenty years after the fact, (and three for me). This will go down as one of my all time favorites and I look forward to having children of my own so I can share this one day with them. Heck, the day before they START high school.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

This film has moments of pure honesty that I've never seen before in a teen comedy. If you're a teenager, you'll love it, at least you should. I never met anyone who saw it and didn't like it. Also, little kids should not see it. It talks about things and shows things that they're not ready for yet. it has great parts for example when Spicoli orders pizza to the classroom and the teacher gets very mad. it just shows how high school was back then in California. which looked like a lot of fun. the film also, used a lot f the techniques that most movies do. for example, they would fade from scene to scene. but overall, this was a great movie and should be watched by teens all over.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
228,trentonlaz,If Your Looking for Some Laughs,8,21 December 2016,"Fast Times at Ridgemont High takes place in a high school in California during the 80's. The movie is meant to show the lives of highschoolers that you don't see and just go into their lives. The movie is a very entertaining movie with many laughs in it. The story however is very minor and takes the backseat to the comedy. You can relate to the characters very well if you are in high school, even though they look at least 10 years older, and the film is definitely geared towards the younger teenage audience. In order to enjoy this film you can't take it seriously and just enjoy it. It is a quick movie and it is a very easy movie to watch and i would recommend it to any young person looking for a funny movie to watch.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
229,derek_seymour-1,Another classic teen movie from the 80's,8,14 July 2008,"I was really lucky to see this film. I put it on for background noise while I read a book. Somehow, I found myself regularly looking up from the book and then putting it down to concentrate on the movie. I wish I had seen it when I was a teenager. I know I would have loved it. The thing I like about this movie is that it's set in the 80's when I was a teenager, and it was fun to be transported back to a time I strongly identify with (love those space-invaders), it's got some great characters, it looks great, it's funny and it's true. If you rent the DVD there are some cool extras as well. I watched them all, then listened to the commentary! I am a fan. What amazes me about these early movies is how many went on to mega-stardom (Sean Pen) and how many should have - but didn't (Romano). If you like this I recommend you check out Mat Dillon in ""Over the Edge"" as well. Cult Classic!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Anyone who just wants to sit back, chill out and have a good time watching these interesting breeds of characters just live life. It is quite similar to Dazed and Confused yet a little more of a social critique than Dazed is. The movie does a good job at juxtaposing the 'fake' with the 'true'. We see how the more ""mature & sophisticated"" crowd (Linda, Mike, Brad and Mr. Hand) all have biased morals and think very highly of their social status. Whereas Spicoli, Stacy and Mark all let loose and have morals they themselves have established. So whether you're in a serious mood and are interested in a quite interesting character and moral study or just chillin at home watchin the movie with Mary Jane for some laughs, this movie delivers!",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

It is basically about group of teenagers going through their senior year facing many problems like having sex ,losing their virginity and doing drugs . The cast is very well assembled with relative unknown faces at that time and most of them have made it big specially Sean Penn whose role in this movie is very different from the roles we are used to seeing him. Though he was great but my favorite was Damon .Both the girls were gorgeous and had a lot of part in the success of this film.This is a classic movie in this genre and many attempts have been made to make a movie like this but they haven't been successful . Now days teen films are semi porn movies they don't make it like they used to make it in the 70s and 80s. American pie is good but with all the sequels that they have made it is not great anymore .This movie will always be the benchmark for making teen movies.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

235,Asmus Teis,Was anyone else bothered by the way abortion was presented in this film?,5,9 June 2002,"When I saw this film a few years ago in the late 90's as a teen, I was floored by the irresponsibility that the teenagers in the film had in their approach to sex, and then especially with Jennifer Jason Leigh's character's nonchalance at having an abortion. I am a male, and thus cannot comment from personal experience, but I would think that the decision of whether or not to have an abortion would be a slightly bigger decision than it is to her in the film? Her conversation with the baby's father is as such: ""I'm pregnant."" ""Whoa. I guess you're wanting an abortion?"" ""Yes. And I want you to pay half and drive me to the clinic."" I also would think that the abortion itself would be more traumatizing than it is presented in the film; Leigh's character tells all her friends immediately what a b****rd that guy was for not driving her to the clinic. I don't consider myself to be sexist in any way, but I lose respect for a woman with such a nonchalant fatalistic approach to sex. Perhaps the book describes this better? I'm not sure. But I don't think the film sets a very good example.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

237,antonuccichristopher,The best high school movie made!,10,9 August 2006,"One of my all time favorite movies. It tells how high school was and still is. Written by Cameron Crowe, which was first a book, and then turned into a movie. To me, this is probably the best high school movie ever made. Other high school classics such as American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and American Pie go along with this movie. But no high school movie is as great as this is. This taught me all about high school and what to do. They still have the same groups that were in high school back then today in my school: stoner's, jocks, popular crowd, beauties, etc. Almost all the high school movies made got their inspiration from this one.I first got into Cameron Crowe after watching ""Almost Famous"" (my favorite movie) when my cousin gave it to me for Christmas. I loved that movie. Then him and my father told me about Fast Times and I knew I had to see it. After watching it, I watched the special features and learned that Crowe went back to high school to research what high school was like at the time. He turned into a book, they liked it and asked him to turn it into a script, and Amy Heckerling directed it well.If you are looking for a really good high school movie, this is the one to watch. I hope me comment helped to whoever is reading it.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
238,petesredfox,Background for this Movie,8,12 February 2013,"This movie is based on fact.Cameron Crowe, in his 1981 book Fast Times at Ridgemont Hight (Simon and Schuster publishers) explains the following.Whilst writing articles for a youth culture magazine, not a day went by when the term 'the kids' wasn't used. Everything was done in mind as appealing to the 'kids' market, whether that be music, movies, everything and this began to fascinate Crowe.As a 22 year old in 1979, Crowe discussed the idea of the book with his publisher who advised him to return to school and find out what was really going on with these kids. In 1972 Crowe had attended Ridgemont Snr High for Summer School and had been enthralled with the place because his regular school was a strict Catholic one. To him Ridgemont seemed sublime and forbidden.In 1979 principal William Gray at Ridgemont was mooted the plan by Crowe, to be a Snr for a full year. This would result in enough material for Crowe to write his book about contemporary high school.Principal Gray, initially skeptical about this venture was won over when Crowe began to list the celebrities he had been writing about and thus the project was underway. Gina George an English teacher was let into the secret and became Crowe's homeroom teacher and Crowe began his undercover project as a High School Snr.Crowe was totally ignored at Ridgemont during his first month there and met Linda Barrett after school one day in a journalism class. She befriended Crowe and because of her job at the local ice cream shop, Linda was a notable person on campus. She introduced Crowe to many people and he became part of her group of friends.Following his year at Ridgemont where Crowe became so accepted as part of the crowd, that even the Principal mistook him for a Snr at the Prom, he came clean on the project and interviewed many of his characters extensively and corroborated their stories and his notes from the previous year. Crowe's assertion in the books Preface of February 1981 is that all the incidents are true, only superficial identifying characteristics have been changed.If you can get hold of a copy of Fast Times at Ridgemont High it is well worth the read. The movie does not really do the story justice. In my opinion it would do well from a remake with a fresh look at the book resulting in a much more cohesive and detailed movie.Enjoy :)",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
239,davecampbell,there *was* a sequel...,10,26 January 2008,"...it's called ""Clueless"" - Fast Times for the '90s. As a class of '82er myself, this movie really spoke to me (while Clueless *so* did not - but I enjoyed it anyway).On the DVD commentary, Cameron Crowe talks about how the studio pressured them to change the music from what they had originally; I remember particularly the use of Jackson Browne in certain scenes where I always thought it was perversely inappropriate, and to find that the director originally had different, and much more appropriate, music in those scenes made me wish they'd do a Director's Cut with the originally-intended music inserted.Then I saw the Director's Cut DVD of Donnie Darko, and in the commentary the director discusses how the theatrical release had some of the same music in a different order, and they moved everything back to where they originally wanted it in the DVD.So why not do that with Fast Times?",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Despite the future famous actors were just beginning, i think all are great in it's roles: being Judge Reinhold, Phoebe Cates, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sean Penn the most interesting. Still, i think the movie is not so entertaining as could be your average 80 teenage comedy because at the same time tries to dealt with youth issues like abortion, masturbation and, even, dope.Some of these topics are treat in a funny way (Like in the Jeff Spicoli role), but the things go darker and more serious, and maybe its was necessary to the movie to succeed.

Anyone who went to high school in the 80's will probably be able to compare their classmates with the characters in the movie.

Every word that comes out of his mouth is so funny and quotable. Spicoli is truly one of the greatest characters to come out of the 80's. He's not the only actor of note here.

There is not a mercedes or bmw in sight. These characters have a realness and a vulnerability you do not find in other movies of the genre. You have the Jennifer Jason Leigh character. A pretty girl but not the stereotypical sorority-type idiot. And she ends up falling for a dork like ""Rat."" As for the character of Damone , he has never been equaled in any high school movie. A teenager who says things like, ""is that your brother, he's a good looking kid."" Need one say more? And how about this. The teachers are almost as likable as the students.

247,heathersjunk,I pity and fear the mentality that can create such a film.,1,21 July 2008,"This movie is truly horrible. An entire generation of innocent teenagers believed that this movie portrayed what love was supposed to be like between teenage boys and girls. The girls in the movie were all portrayed as sexual objects to be lusted after and used for the pleasure of boys. The boys only had one thing on their minds and that was getting laid. You know, before this movie came out, boys were actually able to go on dates with girls without constantly trying to contrive a way to get into their pants. It sickens me that some perverted man would put out a movie like this and basically ruin the dating life of all the generations that came after. Had I only seen this movie as a teenage girl, I would have understood the intentions of boys. Of course, boys didn't always think this way. There was a time when a boy was ecstatic if he simply got to hold a girl's hand. This movie convinced boys that if they weren't trying to get laid, they were doing something wrong. Sex was treated very casually in ""Fast Times"". One of the girls was a virgin and the other girls pressured her to go ahead and have sex. They acted like they had been doing it for years already. It just sickens me that teenagers were portrayed this way. What kind of a monster produces a movie like this and then puts it out there for the world to see? The ignorance in this movie was astounding. The kids were so stupid.I'm aware that most older folks have very fond memories of ""Fast Times"" but I can assure you that by today's standards, this movie would be less than a B-movie. The script was as bad as an x-rated movie. It was just so stupid. And I'm angry that my teenage years were spent fighting off the sexual advances of boys who all felt like they had to try to screw me because some stupid movie taught them to act that way towards girls.Cameron Crowe, I hope you are ashamed of yourself. Please warn your daughters that they need to be on the defense against horny boys all the time thanks to your movie.And, in case you thought you should watch this movie for the humor, trust me when I tell you that only an old fart would think this movie was funny. By today's standards it is extremely asinine and I didn't laugh one time during the whole movie. Society's standards for movies are just so much higher than they used to be. It's amazing that anyone EVER thought that this was funny, but sadly enough, they did. It just goes to show the kind of mentality that people used to have.It saddens me to think that we still have these same old farts running the world. Old people, your time is over. Young people are so much smarter, more compassionate, and have much more wisdom than you ever dreamed of having. Move aside, and let us run things now. Then, our government can finally stop destroying everything and actually begin healing the world.Do not watch this movie.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High

CROWE is an awesome writer. the character DAMONE spouts one liners about chicks and broads like he's been getting' it on since kindergarten. but an acute eye will notice a new swagger to his walk the day after his pool house romp with STACY, which anyone who's ever lost their virginity will tell you can only mean one thing. Did anyone catch this was his first time?and then there's LINDA BARRETT, who is allegedly dating a 40 year old pilot or something and pedantically informs STACY that their love-making sessions typically last about 45 minutes and they always climax together. am i the only person who recognizes that she has never had sex and has learned everything she thinks she knows from the pages of COSMOPOLITAN?If it's been a while since you've indulged, you should watch this movie again. hell, I should watch this movie again -- if only to find other brilliant subtle aspects which permeate what is possibly the most quintessential high school movie of all times. how cool would it be to have the distinction of having been a part of such a thing? my hat is off to you CAMERON, and AMY HECKERLING as well (along with all the on-screen talent).

There was no mothers at home managing the house and the children anymore, they now had to work nine to five like the fathers. Or there were no fathers around at all, due to growing divorce rates. No relatives, no churches, nothing, just the teenagers. The almost complete absence of adults in the movie shows this new reality quite well. Only the school professor represents the extinct social order, well intentioned but ineffective like an obsolete machine of a bygone era.Adolescents do whatever they want and there's nobody to seek advice from except their own friends. Despite its comedy intention, the movie shows a somewhat sad and lonely world in a very raw and crude realistic way. Sex, abortion and other crucial issues and decisions are taken in a light, irresponsible way.Was it really like that? Yes, it was. As a portrait of a generation, the film is very accurate. I lived through it, for I was a teenager myself in the early 80's. It was pretty much like that. No father and no mother around to supervise much, all calls up to me for better or for worse.It may not be an artistic master piece like American Graffiti, but it is a good movie and an invaluable document of an age.",Fast Times at Ridgemont High
256,SmknMovies,Nobility in an 80's sex comedy,10,2 July 2021,"Amy Heckerling's Fast Times at Ridgemont High is one of the few 80's sex comedies that feels honest but still charming, daring but still touching, edgy but still innocent and disturbing but still feel good. It walks an razor's edge without a stumble and is an 80's movie that the 80's never deserved. Most of this genre is crowded with only a male first person perspective and that is what is singly subversive about this movie. I think a lot of boys and men (most likely the intended audience) might not have fully noticed that they were experiencing young adulthood though a female perspective but still digested it and carried it with them. I'm glad I saw it when I was a teenager (as a male). Jennifer Jason Lee's character was so nuanced, tragic and sweet trying to navigate though what society and her peers expectations of her were. She is so naive but never do we ever think of her as dumb. She is ironically the most mature character in the movie. The only scene of pure titillation is the pool scene with Phoebe Cates and remember it is only in the head of Judge Reinhold's character. Phoebe just had water in her ear! There is a lot of bad behavior but no character is played as a movie bad guy. Every body has their own outlook and motivation but no one is trying to hurt anyone on purpose. It just happens because they're young and are engaging in things that they are not mature enough to fully understand. The worst of the characters is Damone and he still has humanity. In the days of rewatching old movies from the 80's and getting confronted by how horrible the attitudes were (looking at you Sixteen Candles) this movie ages beautifully.
